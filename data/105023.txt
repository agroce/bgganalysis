There is a game here somewhere.  Too unwieldy with stacks and strange combat results. Japanese carriers too plentiful with no loss of aircrew capabilities. I have played 42, 43 and 44 scenarios with losses due to not making objectives.  Never enough US supply to push around all those neat forces and Japanese battle plans that are able to dominate combat. 

The ability to load up aircraft on small islands is silly and too ahistorical for me to overlook.  I don't feel like investing the time to make something half descent out of this mess.  

Appears to have not been play tested enough imo.  I would probably (likely) play some more of this game if a vassal version were available but that is unlikely to happen. 

Update**  A Vassal version is now available through DVG--and they are charging for it!!??  No way I'm sinking anymore money into this title.  What a bummer.  Had some potential.

Probably the best of the FC series. Very exciting and thrilling. Simple enough with a great and smooth sequence of play. Plenty of decisions to take. All aspects of the campaign are represented in a simple and very enjoying way. I will not describe the cons here since well covered by other comments.

This game is rapidly becoming the poster child for my resolution to not buy anything until some reviews have come out.  I am really interested in this topic, DVG has a great reputation, I was very tempted to pre-order this one....

But the questions being raised are really troubling.  This sounds like it would be a huge disappointment to me.  So very glad to be on the sidelines with my money in my wallet.

Update Feb 2015 - Seems clear this is not the game for me.  The various departures from history and military logic ruin it for me.  I see no point in playing a game with such departures.  When even Armchair General calls it "Alt Hist" ....

RATING: 9
The box contains the Pacific Ocean (in a minimized version) depicted on a hard board map, a battle map, a rules book and tons of thick counters. All made by fine material; a deluxe boardgame for solitaire play. 

The game tries to simulate the Pacific War theater during WWII on a STRATEGIC level in a totally different concept of game mechanics. The human player gets the 'custody' of the US and Allied forces and the AI of the game handles the forces of the Japanese Empire. All forces, from both sides, are portrayed on the counters with their offensive factors,  in an abstract way, taking in consideration capital ships, major land troop formations as well as major wing commands.  

The rules for movement and battle might seem odd or even deviating from reality but give, surprisingly,  historical results. Gamers who are meticulous regarding battlefield tactics and want to follow the footsteps of the historical military events should better avoid this title. 

The downside of this wargame: the rules book which leaves plenty of room for ambiguities and questions and the absence of a linked campaign game. The former issue can be fixed by downloading the 'Unofficial FAQ' in the Files Section. For the latter, the player has to play each year of the war separately and add his victory points gathered in each year to get a campaign performance status of his achievements or failure. 

The game is fun, innovative in solitaire play mechanics and approaches this theater of clashes from a different perspective.

Read the rules but haven't played it so take my opinion for what it's worth but from what I can gather, this would of been much better as "Task Force Commander: Fletcher" (or Halsey perhaps) and not Nimitz and the entire PacWar crammed in to one box.  In otherwords, the scope and size is just too much for the system to properly handle.

This is my first military strategy board game in almost 30 years. I find FCN to be a challenging but satisfying experience. The map boards and pieces are beautiful and sturdy. There are many important decisions to make each phase/turn. I find the game hard to win. So combined with the highly unpredictable Japanese AI, the replayability level is very high. I do understand that some find the AI to be too random, ahistorical, and even bizarre. I do understand those gamers who feel the game too abstract. They have a valid point. Why, for instance, is a Japanese invasion of Australia impossible in the game? But for me, I don't mind the abstraction. I don't want a complete recreation of a historical event. As someone in another post commented, he wants the resources given to a Fleet Commander and then he wants to pursue his own strategic course. I agree completely. If I wanted to completely recreate a historical event, I'll read a book. One review of the game called FCN "alternate history." Isn't that what a gaming experience is actually supposed to be? However the game isn't perfect. I find the board too small. I wish the game included task force markers so as to reduce the numbers of counters on the board. There's no accounting for Philippines in 1942. Is it even possible for the Japanese to invade Alaska? If not, why? They did in real life. But in the end, despite whatever historical issues and gameplay issues exist, I consider FCN to be well worth my time and money. In addition, to me it's just plain fun.

This game is a hidden gem! Sure it has its flaws and the rulebook is badly written (weird for a DVG game) but if you look the whole picture and consider that the designer managed to include an epic struggle in this box then you will realize that its a masterpiece!

Hint, use at least 3-4 extra (different colors) d10 and this will save you lot of time during battles...

There is a lot of fun to be had this game, but it doesn't quite hold up for me as well as Field Commander Napoleon. The nature of the random AI can led to some extremely strange situations occurring, which was not such an issue with Napoleon.

There are already variants appearing that help address this so I might have to check them out at some point.

Solitaire game like field commander. I did not know this game existed, I could not find it with the other field commander since it's called Fleet Commander. I was hesitating to get napoleon, being a fan on Pacific WW2, I don't think I will hesitate for this one. There are so few games that covers the entire pacific.

After a video review: The critics are not so good for this game, it's much more fiddly, and the 4 scenarios cannot be chained, they are 4 separate scenarios.

Up to now, napoleon seems to be the best game. Else a lot of rule modifications  would be required. What they should have done is make a game with small campaigns like napoleon instead of using the whole strategic map. Use what has been working in the previous games.

Else the box could be very big for me.

Great game! It needs a FAQ from Dan Veersen to clarify some points but it's a very addictive game and difficult to win compared to the other solitaire games that I have played before.
In my opinion, the AI is better than in FC Napoleon. Or I was just "lucky" to have the AI play so well during my games. I never experienced strange moves by the AI, and when I look at the movement table, it must be quite rare if that happens.
Very good game and very good material.

Edited: Still satisfied by the AI but...the ability to pin an entire Japanese fleet with just one sub or ship is really weird. This should be fixed or the game will be too easy to win just with a gamey strategy. Initialy, I gave a 10, but I will wait to see how it works now that I discovered this...

RATING: 6.5
This game has a ridiculous number of counters which makes for a daunting setup process but the game flows like nothing else I've ever played.

The unpredictability of fleet movements and the dynamic quality of island assaults is awe inspiring. The games difficulty can feel overwhelming at stages but it balances out over time. 

I wouldn't call the game 'fun' but it is a very interesting dynamic puzzle to be juggled and solved. If that type of thing interests you then check it out... otherwise avoid it.

I'm really enjoying it but I don't know how often it will get played because of the longer setup time... And because it has to compete for my attention with another great DVG game - Warfighter.

Update - I really want to get this to the table again but the set up time is a beast!

Update - I like the game but it never gets played anymore. Set up time is refi curious and there are better DVG games.

RATING: 6
- Set up seems to take ages, although there are no choices to be made (cfr. Warfighter)
- Although it is supposed to mirror the situation in the Pacific at that time, Japanese movement is too random to be credible.

I will not go into detail about the game, except to say I got rid of it fast. But I want to warn everyone about component issues (counters specifically) and a basically non-existant DVG support, which is eager to promise help, and invisible when help actually has to be delivered.
I was promised a replacement counter for a broken one. Heck, we will even send you all 8 sheets, they said. Then nothing. Some 5 or more mails to them later, still nothing.

At this point I have woved to never again buy from DVG. Not only do their games seem to suffer from being underdeveloped (generally speaking, there are some exceptions), but customer service this poor I can not, and will not, stand for.

I've played the 4 campaigns and for me it's the best game in the serie with Field Commander Napoleon. There are numerous choices for the player and with the scounting phase you can react to the japanese movements. The fog of war is perfect in  the japanese movement phase. This is very important in the Pacific war and the AI is perfect for that.The tactical battles are very fun and tense. The game is longer than Napoleon but you can play a campaign in a long session. The rules are more complex but very intuitive and logical. For me, a must have for all Pacific war fans!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Played the 1942 scenario. The game could deserve at least an 8, but the rules are so bad written and incomplete that I'll wait a new rules update before changing my judgment. One suggestion: download the unofficial FAQ in BBG gathered by a player before starting the game. On the front you'll find two important official answers by dvg, which are not posted in the official site. Seriuosly, DVG should rewrite rules simply reading players questions and add more examples with some more pictures. C'mon, I understand it could cost a lot to print on paper , but in 2015 we are happy enough to download everything in pdf format!
Another little complain about the game is the lack of a truly campaign ; campaign is only the sum of the objectives gained in each scenarios (from 42 to 45) and you have to stop if you lose the single scenario.
Update
After playing the '43 year I decided to sell the game. Not bad, but the AI is a little too brutal. Changed my rating of course. Playing with Enemy Ardennes now. Much better :)

Now that I have a few games under my belt, I feel comfortable giving this a rating of 8. It has some historical issues and I don’t like the idea of not offering a full campaign game but it is a whole lot of fun and the tension is high throughout the game. Given the degree of resource management in the game, it kind of reminds me of RAF but much different (of course!).

RATING: 7.5
Feels less true to its theme than Napoleon did but am still having a lot of fun with it. It's meaty enough to require several sittings to play out a campaign year. One turn of Nimitz leaves me as full as a single campaign of Napoleon did. Player must be able to let go of knowledge of actual battle to be able to have a good time with this one. If one tries to blindly play the US as the US actually fought the real war, it will likely end up in disaster. and be an unsatisfying experience. 

Minor issues with a small handful of counters (correct flag not visible due to cutting offset, there's not nearly enough Moved/Resupply counters provided), but that's not too much of  an issue for me. 

Still waiting to see if it holds up over the long term or if it begins to feel repetitive after a while. So far, so good 

=========================

Played it a bunch after it arrived but burned out on it fairly quickly. It will probably still come out from time to time. Played 1942 and 43 several times as well as a long 1942-43 campaign using custom rules. 

Only 4 scenarios, which will play out in a very similar manner. 

I think treating all the land areas as being generic/interchangeable was a missed opportunity to add a bit of historic flavor and introduce some variation.

An okay game in the Commander Series, it had potential however numerous things I find hold it back. The lack of a full campaign can be damning. I found the heavy use of the D10 to be quite a hindrance as well. While the Napoleon game did use the D10 as well for movement orders the battle board combat did not use the D10 as much as Nimitz. In the end I find myself wanting to play Napoleon over Nimitz which fills the role better. The rules could have used more work as well. I would say that the game just feels like it overstays it's welcome for what it is and what you are doing.

So much potential there but it frankly looks like they got in over their heads with this one and decided that after a certain point, they were done with it and that was that.  Lack of support for it is very telling too but customer service is not their strong point.

Look for all the house rules, fixes and variants to make this a much better game.

And it was claimed you could link the yearly scenarios but that simply means you pass victory points from one scenario to another.  Inexcusable.

RATING: 9
Well got to play this and I would say this is an excellent game.  To answer those who are upset about it not being historical in the time line department, so what.  Let's make it clear, this game is not going to follow the way history dictates the war went.  

But what it will do is allow one to play the game with a multitude of what if scenarios.  What if instead of masses the Japanese forces at Midway, like they did in history, they mass them at the Solomon Islands?  And you didn't know that was going to happen.  Maybe the war would have been different.  

Well in this game that can happen.  So you have to get your head out of the historical time line into a what if frame of reference.  

I love that.  What is the point of playing a game that follows history only to know the outcome before you play?  In this game, you don't know where the Japanese will mass and you hope they back off where you are weak.  And they can and sometimes do that.  

So this is a very exciting game that will keep you jumping around wondering where next.  Of course there is some direction because there are object markers that the Japanese are geared to go to.  

I really like this game and only give it a 9 because the rules are so bad.  Full of holes and things are not fully covered.  I spent way too much time on the forum's trying to figure out what and how to do things.  Eventually, I did what I thought best.  Other than that and that is easily remedied, the game is a ton of fun and full of replay ability.  Highly recommended.

My first few attempts to play this were marred by numerous issues mostly the result of vaguely worded and ambiguous statements in the rules as well as sometimes bizarre gameplay.  As expected, the AI has some workload and it's lugubrious to handle 20 chits in a single area, as an example, and have to randomize them and deal with them repeatedly in order to assure that all the units in the stack have received their "orders".   I own and enjoy several different PTO games.  This game isn't really a simulation of WWII as much as a simulation of strategic command in a parallel universe in which the Pacific Theater of WWII may or may not unfold as it did in our universe.  It's a Nimitz simulator, not a WWII simulator. Nevertheless, I'm expecting this game to work well as an exclusively solitaire experience, otherwise it's simply more fun to play both sides of my regular two-player PTO's.   I'll give it a couple more tries to see if it works out.

I really wanted a pacific theatre game and was hoping this could be it, but it's too darn fiddly for my tastes -- I just don't have the time required to setup, play and tear down one of these sessions. Field Commander Napoleon fills that gap nicely (in terms of a solo experience) and I recently picked up Pacific Victory from Columbia Games.

Upon opening the box, it is common for a volume of counters to have separated from the their trees (I had about 100 loose pieces in the bottom of the box).

Initial impressions are that this can be a good game, but is very bad history - it's outright goofy at times due to numerous interlocking random elements. A pile of house rules are going to be necessary to at least restore some sense of history here (if you don't mind some additional complexity as a result).

Things are rather fiddly (e.g., constantly shuffling Japanese stacks and locating/relocating Move markers), but being a solitaire game it doesn't really bother me. But be aware, it can be tedious.

The dialogue rule book (as opposed to a case system) is easy to read, but it also results in numerous vague areas; I had to read the rules multiple times (and take notes) to fathom things.

Australia is on the map, but is off-limits for Japan. There are no rules covering the isolation of Australia, so why bother?

The design has no U.S. forces in the Philippines at onset - huh?

Midway isn't handled properly at all in this game - as is, the Japanese can simultaneously base LBA (as many squadrons as they can get there!) on Midway (as long as they have an infantry ashore), sharing (!?) the airfield along with the U.S. and its 2 squadrons. Impossible. Since Midway is the linchpin of the American defenses, this has to be fixed or we've entered fantasy land.

Forget about fighting for the Solomons because the AI forces Midway to be the new Guadalcanal.

Plane losses from carriers are always completely replaced at the end of every battle. This means that CBA is fully expendable because you know the planes will magically re-appear. So as the U.S., you simply cannot short-term or strategically affect a Japanese carrier by eliminating its elite squadrons. Values are fixed in stone by year, and that's the way it is going to be, regardless of how the game plays out.

Stronger infantry units actually do a worse job protecting airfields, due to hit number priority.

When attacked by planes, escorted transports are virtually invulnerable because they take hits last (invaders just waltz ashore on the 1st round of battle).

As discovered by another player, a good U.S. strategy in '42 is to abandon certain non-Objective areas so that the AI won't move to them. This puts up an invisible force field up between those areas and Objective areas. Wow, just wow.

The design further encourages tactics that have no resemblance to reality. For example, instead of gaining valuable Scouting intel on the enemy fleet at a particular location, Spend that Supply Point instead to send in a suicide unit (a cheap sub or DD will work well) to "pin" the enemy fleet, preventing them from moving. Who knew that the USN maintained a kamikaze organization in 1942?

During bombing runs, in this game anti-aircraft fire targets enemy Fighters in the same area first - right, let's ignore those attack planes who are carrying bombs and torpedoes, trying to sink your ships! Good grief, Charlie Brown...

One could quibble over the erroneous ship ratings and an inaccurate OOB, but that's probably pointless.

There is an entirety of one playtester listed in the credits - one.

And the bizarro list goes on and on...

Abstractions at this scale are of course reasonable and necessary, but too many strange things happen with the abundance of randomization and ass-backwards history in the game. I'm well aware that the designer has a reputation for getting the history wrong in his games, but things are really exacerbated here.

How tolerant will gamers be for these wonky situations? Some don't know or care about the history and can enjoy an 'Axis & Allies'-like experience (with pretty counters). Actually, Nimitz is worse than an 'Axis & Allies' experience because the game pretends to be something it isn't - an historical wargame. Instead, it is an illusory abomination that borders on being a farce.

*Warning*: you will not be able to play a continuous campaign, 1942-1945. Instead, you are expected to play the 4 separate yearly campaigns and then "link" the tallies together. The obvious problem is that the results of one yearly campaign do not carry over to the next year (some very gamey plays are thus allowed), and you have to reset the whole thing each January - no, I'm not kidding.

A *huge* disappointment, but I am so interested in the theme that I'm going to stay with the discussion to see if things can be worked out. [edit: rating lowered, this goofy game is completely beyond repair - I give up, traded away. What a shame, as the Pacific War is my favorite military topic.]

One of the very worst hobby experiences that I have ever had. I'm completely done with DVG, shame on them for this piss-poor 'game' (more of a train wreck). Ugh.

Very enjoyable game even out of the box and even better with errata/minor fix.

It's not a simulation of WW2 PTO but more of a 'how it might have gone'. The Japanese AI can and does make some bad plays, but they did historically too.

There is a fair amount of abstraction here, but in exchange you get the entire Pacific Theater including ships, subs, land-based air, and ground forces in a very playable and fun format.

Fleet Commander: Nimitz has some similarities to VITP. Since it is a solitaire game it has some restrictions. I found that some of the criticisms that have been made about the game is founded. The game engine results in rather poorly optimized Japanese play. The high losses on LBA is dubious, but not a gamebreaker. All in all, it is a fun experience nevertheless. I do pack up the Japs in Task Forces in order to get them a fairer chance as a house rule.

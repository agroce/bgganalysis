[thing=41429][/thing] was my "game of the year" in 2011 and a constant in my top 10.  It is one of the most perfect games ever made.  If you read my rating/comment(dissertation) on it, you can see why.

As good as it was, this is even better.  The proficiency system is much better and smoother.  The modifiers work more smoothly.  Everything is just polished a little better and the east front has a completely different feel.

I'm not a tactical war gamer--if you are playing at that scale, miniatures seem like the better choice. But I would play this one again. And again, and again. Simple to learn, streamlined design, the units operate accurately by virtue of the design, not stupid rules. Great choice!

Bought the game, haven't played it yet.

I don't like the art. In fact, it was almost a reason for me to ignore the game. But I've bought it anyway because of the great initial feedback here at BGG.

However, being a great fan of Combat Commander and the chaos that you have to deal with in that game, I am not expecting a very exciting game here. Maybe the mechanics will be easier and even better in terms of a representation of the reality of tactical combat in WW2. But, to me, the storytelling aspect is almost as important as the mechanics behind it. And in that respect, Combat Commander is king.

So, I'm not expecting much out of this series. Let's see. I intend to experiment it in the next few weeks.

Band of Brothers is a masterpiece.  In my view it's both accurate and highly playable; a brilliant example of 'design for effect'.  It contains a simple ruleset which, from what I can see, accurately simulates WWII squad-level action, thereby enabling the players to focus on tactics and strategy without getting drowned in chrome or drawn into unhistorical tactics.

Ghost Panzer is more enjoyable than Screaming Eagles, for me at least, because the Russians and Germans are so different, the difference in tactics being forced by the wide differences in proficiency.

In contrast Americans and Germans play essentially the same game -- they're similar enough that they use the same basic tactics.  This is the first system I've seen which so dramatically illustrates the differences in style between the German-Russian conflict and the Western Allied - German conflict.

RATING: 9.5
After many years of playing ASL, I had long harboured doubts about its infantry combat mechanics (to name a few: lack of fire suppression; poor or no tactical fire and movement; over-reliance on units 'breaking' and 'routing'; excessive stacking; almost super-human leaders) when a couple of years ago a friend came over and he brought Band of Brothers: Screaming Eagles. 

I was both intrigued and doubtful, at first. Afterall, I'd invested a lot of time and money in ASL. I also wanted some of the chrome that ASL has. I couldn't see at the time that I had become addicted to complexity as I had internalised much of the ASL rule book. I could play ASL well and it had been the only game in town. That's the other aspect of ASL: it is so complex that if you want to play it well, you had better play it a lot and often. Which for me, meant not playing anything else at all. So breaking from ASL, was like breaking from a whole belief system. 

But the more I played Band of Brothers the more I liked it. So I moved on from BoB: Screaming Eagles and bought BoB: Ghost Panzer. Between the two games, the designer, Jim Krohn, has listened closely to player feedback and refined and improved the system even more. He's also added some great optional rules.

BoB is an intuitive game, one that once you have learnt it you can focus on playing tactically, rather than playing to comply with the multitude of rules that are often found in other systems. And as BoB has a much lower rules overhead than ASL, I now have the time to play and enjoy other games, such as GBoH. 

I really, really like the way Jim has designed a system that reflects the fire and move tactics of squad level combat. I also like the way he's gone further than just having a morale value to equate to troop quality: his combat units are also graded for their proficiency with Proficient Firepower and for their tactical ability for moving or defending in a hex with casualty ratings. I know too that his design is based on years of thorough research. 

In my humble opinion, Jim's work is a masterpiece of design, both for its simplicity, its rules economy and for what it delivers in simulation gaming.

RATING: N/A
Quick playtime, VERY realistic feel, easy to learn. Whats not to love.

This game has the tightest rule set I have ever seen in a wargame, and on top of that it has outstanding support from the designer. 
The only things that keeps me from making this the only "10"rated game in my collection is the map graphics (which is not bad at all, but just not my style).
But once I get even more plays of this I suspect the rating will eventually increase.

If I should make a criticism it would be that it doesnt quite have the depth and tension (in pure game terms) of Conflict of Heroes, but it is clearly superior as a simulation and ALL the choices you are making in the game are rooted in realistic tactics and you FEEL like a company commander when playing BoB.

I want to like this game and wish I could but there is one reason I cannot:
Absolutely horrible rulebook (and I have the 2.1 rules edition) and the Player Aid Card is just as bad. I fought through learning how to play only to discover that, though the gameplay is overall simpler than Combat Commander, it's twice as hard to learn from the rules. 
I had to lookup flowchart files from BGG to help remember the entire play procedure order with regards to all the conceal, ops fire, and MC checks. Then remembering the formulas for how each unique combat situation worked is another mess with no simple flat formula reminding you what you need to roll lower than in each given scenario. 

It's not that all of this is that complicated, it's just that the rules splash important information here and there without properly scaffolding your understanding of necessary prerequisites, compounded by the fact that there is no quick and easy overall summary reminder. The PAC only lists modifiers, not core reminders of the basics. For that, you flip through the first 8 pages constantly. 

Don't even get me started on the "Halftracks" rules, or why the Casualty ranking for guns is where the FP rating is for infantry, and in its place is their "Proficiency" ranking. Graphic design and visuals do nothing to help you remember what to do with all of this inconsistency.

I can see a good game hidden behind this cluster**** of rule layout & formatting. But if I'm going to the trouble of downloading spreadsheets to help me remember order of play, I'd rather just pull out a Great Battles of History game. 

Next on my list of games to learn is either Virgin Queen, Unconditional Surrender, or Absolute Victory.
Either of the three should be a piece of cake after this!

Played the first four scenarios. The system may be very realistic (tons of good ideas) but, from a purely gaming perspective, ASL or LnL are, in my opinion, much more exciting to play. Anyway, I'm probably nitpicking there since, again, the system is very good. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Not a bad tactical WWII system - I like the interactive impulse system and the levels of suppression is a nice mechanic that does feel more 'realistic' than the OK/broken status of ASL. Despite that it just doesn't grab me as much as the more detailed behemoth.

I guess I was expecting more based on the great feedback on both this game and Screaming Eagles.

I love Combat Commander, so maybe I just set the bar too high. Ghost Panzer is a good game.

The proficiency, casualty, command points and operation ranges concepts are all good. It just didn't "click" for me.

Best WW2 tactical level game.  The least overhead for the most realism and enjoyment.  The player has real control, but the narrative is still strong.  Gamey tactics don't work.

For me, better than Combat Commander because of the suppression mechanics, and better than ASL because of the lack of rules minutia (BOB feels very streamlined).

Played the Infantry training scenario a couple of times swapping sides each time. 

Looks like a condensed ASL experience (yes final fire, I'm looking at you), while the close combat system is pretty original being it attritional (not lopsided, yes Combat Commander I'm looking at you), AND the morale check while being adjacent in the same hex as enemy units makes it different from what I've seen so far. 

Won both scenarios, yet I found the fun factor lacking. I'm sure that the exact same scenario in ATS or V&V would have been more fun to play. 

I'm sure that more plays will be required to assess if this is a keeper or not. 

UPDATE
Realized that had been playing the game wrong. Reduction in melee causes full suppression, and units do not recuperate if in melee. Close combat is thus truly a lethal endeavour, an avenue to be taken only with a sheer weight of numbers, and with solid reserves to be fed to the meat grinder. Since these are very important, blockbusting requires that a building be well isolated from external reinforcements. 

All in all I'm curious to play this with the correct rules, I bumped the rating up 0.5

Enhanced rules. Nice engine. Realistic (for a game). Maybe a better tactical game in that respect then the CoH series but it tastes a bit dry. Fighting Formations and Combat Commander serves a better, more convincing job when it comes to simulating realism through mechanisms and game experience.

A squad level game that is completely different from all others. I believe it very simply models squad level combat and forces you to use the fire and maneuver tactics that were common in World War 2. 

Ghost Panzer focuses on the 11th Panzer Division and adds things like Smoke, Flame Tanks, Stukas, Halftracks, etc.  Although it is the second game in the series, it is a stand alone game.  

This game will ship with the new, streamlined Proficiency rules and counters that keep the results of the system the same, but eliminate the need for some die rolls.  It plays even quicker than the original (Band of Brothers: Screaming Eagles).

In case you did not catch this part - I'm the designer.

 I have both this game and "Screaming Eagles," I like the
streamlining of the combat, even though it takes a little
getting used to. Some of the rules seemed a little vague to me, but a few questions in the Forums and prompt replies by Jim cleared them up. Although the rules are only 14 pages, I found that you really had to pay close attention to every page, as there's a lot crammed in there. That said, this game is going to get a lot of playing time (solo) on my table. My wargaming buddy moved to Georgia and I live in Florida, he's gotten his copy, eagerly awaiting a VASSAL module so I can go head to head. Good going Worthington Games, now let's see the Marines in the next module!

For some reason the infantry counter art looks more cartoony to me than in Screaming Eagles, and it bugs me.  I also aggressively hate the bright red Soviet counters; I thought matching units' morale colors to the suppression markers was really clever in Screaming Eagles, and making the units the same color as the extremely important fully suppressed markers ruins that.

Update: you know, [i]after[/i] pledging for the [gameid=153558] kickstarter (I need updated [gameid=41429] counters!), I finally had a chance to play this several times with the same opponent--[i]real scenarios,[/i] even, not just the training scenarios again--and the fun-per-minute just wasn't as high as, say, [gameid=84].  Torn between "Yeah, I'll play this!" and "well... OK, I'll play this," but going with the lower rating for now.  There's not currently a tactical system I'd [i]rather[/i] play, but last time I got together with that opponent, we switched to [gameid=38786] rather than try another BoB scenario.

Very nice maps and pieces.  I really like the idea of small markers on big pices.  This is the game I'll be playing when I hit 80!  Both the morale and LOS rules are simple yet effective.  Combat and opportunity fire are both straightforward and logical.  The rules summary on the player aid card is great, so there is little need to refer back to the rules.

The infantry example of play at the back of the rules booklet is well done, but a bit narrow given the combined arms form the game has taken.

Just received GP, and have the first game on the way. Have only played the intro scenarios solitaire (a few times each), and I really like the system. It's very playable and encourages real life tactics at the same time. The Suppression rules are really beautiful, the best rules I've seen in a tactical game for accounting for suppression/ breaking. 

I love the big counters and big hexes, but it does tend to make the game feel more constricted than, say, Squad Leader. Some scenarios are very 'static-y', I'd say - sometimes the nature of combat between adversaries where one or both are in cover, but nevertheless, it might not appeal to some people. 

I know more games for this system are in the works, and more squad types/ armor/ ordnance and maps can only make the game better. I'm happy that Jim Krohn, the designer, has vowed to not expand the basic rules set -- that really had started to kill SL by the time of Crescendo of Doom. But, I also hope that more special rules can be added as needed (as opposed to more pointless chrome and system rules and modifications, a la SL) -- these type of rules already exist in the game: smoke, trenches, stukas, hedgerows, etc.

The armor rules are also fairly simple, but just work. So glad that pointless detail like turrets is abstracted (rather cleverly), and the game doesn't go down the rabbit hole of hull/ turret/ etc hits. A proficiency rating accounts for turrets, radios, crew skill, etc, and the hit/ to kill process is quick and makes sense. In general, I'd say that the GP system gets at around 80% of the 'historicity',or flavor, of the ASL armor rules with 15% of the rules overhead, and cuts out 90% of the gaminess. From my rather limted experience, it seems like vehicles in ASL are generally used in the most gamey way allowed by the rules the majority of the time. The proficiency rating used here is near genius in how it adds an historical feel with virtually zero rules overhead.

I think with the streamlining GP has brought to the BoB system, this is now right at or near the top of the tactical WW2 heap. A fine design. Can't wait to see what the new games bring to the table. 

Edit Sept. '15: Been playing this along with some ASLSK/ ASL and Combat Commander recently. They all have things to like and dislike, but I really think a nearly perfect WW2 tactical system would be a more streamlined (while still being very wide scope) ASL, but using BoB's suppression system and command system. I think aside from the chrome (and associated rules) bloat, the parts of ASL that hold up least are the radical broken/ good order status of squads (yeah, there is pinned as well, but it's relatively rare), and the sort of kludgy turn structure. IMO, the worst thing about BoB is that the situations often seem very restricted. That was the case in the war frequently at this scale, but it makes playing the game less open and exciting than it could be. One of the things ASL does well is its use of space and the opportunity for movement.

I will also say, anytime I come back to play BoB, I am stunned by the huge counters -- they are almost tiles. Their size is part of why the maps/ scenarios can feel constricted, but they are still impressive to pick up and examine.

Really looking forward to Texas Arrows.

A massive improvement on Screaming Eagles and one packed with nearly 70 tanks and numerous types of Soviet infantry. The rules changes are for the better (I retroact most of the changes when I play Eagles, though I keep the morale modifiers as on the counters).

One doubt: the tank counters seem to lack presence, though I admit that is a subjective thing. Also, I would've liked some armoured cars, particularly Soviet BM10s.

This entry is updated from the 2014 record to reflect the release of the re-mastered edition. Everything in the following paragraphs is lifted from my Screaming eagles entry as this is a series game. I would add that the module mostly provides early war Russians and their proficiency levels are very low especially compared to the German units ... but the result is that this module reall shows how the Proficiency system highlights differences in troop quality and training etc. But when those Russians do get to act (like the T-34), they do so at their full capability and they are something for the German player to respect. I think there is an improvement overall in the scenarios in this module. Quite a lot of the scenarios use more mapboards and that roadnet can look very obvious when that happens.

Excellent Squad level tactical game. The systems used make for realistic effects such as supression of the enemy being important before you move out into the open.

The subject is potentially complicated as evidenced by some other tactical games out there, but Jim has managed to get a full system including tanks, guns and artillery into a relatively short ruleset and there is staged learning (infantry only) to help.

The proficiency rule is superb as it is a single simple mechanic that abstractly covers so much right across the full game. For example it's use better shows the tactical capability and differences of self propelled guns, turreted tanks and elite crews of Tiger I's than gun / armour tables would alone do.

The artillery rules are only half a page long and do equally well as more complicated sets. The relationship between the rout and melee phases is also very clever.

Tank on tank combat is clean and straight forward and it works very well and the gun / armour / proficiency ratings feel right. I love the way for a 'knock out' that you are simply rolling against the difference of armour and gun ratings, having already determined the 'Capability' of the vehicle to make the shot.

It used to take a few games for the modifiers to become second nature because modifiers were not streamlined, but the new v2.1 rules deals with that and you are very much good to go within a few turns of playing.

My only niggle is that some of the scenarios make use of dummy units - these add some flavour in face to face games but generally are disappointing to the solitaire player (everything else handles well solitaire and there is in fact a specific rule suggestions as to how to handle decoys in solitaire play). There are ways around it that have been mentioned here on the forums and I generally trade them in for an actual unit (usually second line) or other appropriate advantage. In solitaire games, I like to play both sides equally and to the best that I can. I think the dummy notion is probably a hang-over from the days when this was initially a block game and really the game itself does not need dummies. 

This is a small niggle because there is a work-around but I would like to see future scenario's have an order of battle alternative for those times when you don't want to field dummies.

The maps are unusual in that they have an arty / cartoon look to them but this very quickly grows on you (I like the shade of green chosen) and now I think they are much more exciting to play on than some more 'drab' options avalable elsewhere. The inf counters are very nice. I would have prefered overheads of the armour rather than the 3/4 angle, but it works fine and for some of the vehicles, it helps with their visual character.

I have a long wargaming history of playing tactical games as my favoured genre and I would say that BoB comes closest to those exciting early days that I had when I first discovered Basic Squad leader. It is clever and fun to play.

Note the new editions use v2.1 rules and now all modifiers are made against unit values rather than the die roll.

RATING: 9
This is a truly excellent squad-level wargame. The components are of high quality: in particular, the large 1" counters are easy to read and move around and the game boards are nicely rendered and geomorphic, allowing for multiple possibilities. The rules for the BoB system are now in Version 2.0 -- they have been tweaked from those in Screaming Eagles, and from what I observe, I think the changes have simplified combat by eliminating dice rolls, yet still maintaining the solid core. There are other worthy squad/platoon level tactical games, but this one definitely ranks with them and is worth your time. One complaint: Worthington Games needs to subcontract to a different box-maker because the boxes for both BoB games, though aesthetically attractive, are exceedingly flimsy.

Most realistic squad-based WW2 game imo, and I have played a lot of different ones. Sold off my whole collection when I got this. Now, whether you find realism fun is a different matter...

Have played the first training scenario twice on Vassal now. Takes some getting used to the new modifiers, but I am liking it. I wish the Russians could shoot... anything at all! It feels a little smoother with the new modifiers. I need to get the physical copy and play more of the armor scenarios before I can rate this.

Okay, the mixed infantry/vehicle scenarios on the big boards are just great. Wow.

Not as good as other WW2 tactical games, however, without any complexity delivers a good feeling of the battleground... A good acquisition.

Great game but just takes longer than I expected when I play solo.  Hopefully the games will go faster when I master the rules better.

kickstarter refunded as I don't really need this game...

I've backed the 2nd chance kick-starter campaign, great deal getting all 3 Band of Brother system games. 8-29-16: Just recieved this as part of 2nd chance kickstarter, cant wait to get it to the table.

Revised proficiency checks remove a die roll from the original, but the difference is small. The suppression mechanism remains the strong point. I'm still not crazy about the armor rules--they seem to be a forced match for the infantry game. The game plays very quickly and the learning curve is minimal.

Brilliant tactical wargame. Brilliant mechanics that rewards classical fire-suppress-melee tactics. Found the rules took a little working out and the online tutorials etc really helped. The vehicle and gun rules work really well once you get them going. The game just sings. 
Great narrative. Tense dice rolls. Although no leader counters you're still rooting for lone units holding out whilst your line slips back to a second defensive position etc.
Probably my favourite ftf wargame closely followed by Combat Commander.

Formerly 8, currently 9. WWII isn`t my favorite period - but after continuous fun games... I must say, it`s at least as good as Screaming Eagles if not better (it is, but I save 10s for antiquity, apparently). I really like it.

A good game, yes. But certainly not the original marvel some try to sell us. For there is nothing original nor unforgettable in what is a just one more tactical system covering WW2.

My preferred tactical WWII system.  Really show differences between Russians and  Germans-- Russians can (and often do) solve problems by literally throwing troops at them.  Germans higher proficiency shows how Pz IIIs with 50mm guns can take on T-34s and KV tanks.

My favourite tactical game, knocks all the others into a cocked hat. My only reservation, which I forget when I'm playing, is the artwork. Eventually it's going to need expansions to cover full national orbats. Great game system.

I think this may turn out to be the definitive squad-level treatment of WW2.  On the upside, it encourages realistic tactics in many ways other tactical games don't; on the downside, it may have fewer interesting decisions.

I really like what Jim Krohn does. I love Space Empires: 4X and when I heard about him working on a WW2 hex&counter game I was sold. I have a different series in my collection - Combat Commander - and those two are giving me all I want from tactical scale of combat. While CC is spectacular in creating an emotional ride of an ever changing war movie Band of Brothers is showing the less glorious but more realistic side of the combat.

The way how simply yet effectively the system works with morale is simply brilliant! You must think not only on how to attack the enemy, to pin him down and maneuver around him but also how to prevent him do the same. It's not that easy to kill a unit here, you have to lower the morale and make the unit unable to act or to follow simple orders. 

I owned the first edition but switched to the second edition for consistent and clarified rules and game components.

This tactical game forces you to act like a real squad leader, spreading your forces out, suppressing the enemy before advancing on them, etc.   Not having to refer to a 100 page rules manual keeps this game simple and FUN.   Yet, tactical decisions have to be made to ensure victory.  The game will probably just click with you, or it won't and you'll move on.  But if it does click, you'll enjoy it immensely!

I’m a fan of tactical level WW2 games and am always searching for the perfect game that hits all the sweet spots. This game doesn’t reach that impossible to achieve standard, but it’s a breath of fresh air, clear thinking, and an excellent addition to the hobby.

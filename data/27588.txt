I really enjoy Coloretto so was looking forward to playing this and it didn't disappoint.

Core rules and play are very similar to Coloretto, but the game is almost completely different, thanks to the coins element.  I found it more fun and quite a bit less vicious.  I'd want to play both games, but with different people.

A pretty fun puzzle/press your luck/optimization game.  artwork is nice.  Money was tight, but did not seem overly critical for winning.  Loading trucks was tricky, should you load one for yourself and hope it tables, or load it on another truck in hopes of screwing someone else.

Ultra-light and fluffy set collection game with a bit of a push-your-luck element, and a nice albeit pasted on theme.  Reminds me of Bohnanza in terms of depth and weight (I do like Bohnanza despite the lack of depth and weight), which is to say I like the game, but I'm not sure I would even count it has having played a game, it's more of a light brief distraction.  Game of the year though?  Please.

My first playing of this was fun, but I felt that it was not a noticeable improvement upon Coloretto. I played it again, and somehow felt much better about it. I understand why it won the SdJ, though I can't compare it to any of the other games up for the nomination. Ultimately, the fact that it's Schacht, it playes quickly, and that it makes me laugh, I'm going to give it two thumbs up.

I'm curious to see how the mini-expansions add to the game.

Looks nice, simple to play, but ultimately a little dry and uneventful. This is pure set-collection with interaction through depriving your opponents of the pieces they need. The theme comes through, but there isn't much tension. I like it, but it feels a little lacking. Maybe expansions would liven it up?

Essentially the same gaming experience as Coloretto. Except that Zooloretto comes in a bigger box and is somehow less abstract. I personally prefer Coloretto due to its compact nature.

2016-03-07
Zooloretto is an incredible game for how many meaningful decisions there are for such a simple game. Along with its sibling Coloretto, this game offers one of the best decisions-per-minute ratios. 

The game's simplicity, however, is also its downfall. It comes in a big box but there is no reason why one should choose Zooloretto over much cheaper, more compact and easier to play Coloretto. Despite being less abstract, Zooloretto feels more complicated due to the forced theme and restrictions, while the core of the game (and thus the experience) is still unchanged.

Much prefer the base game without expansions. Feel the expansions offer too many things which require money but with no additional methods of getting it and money was quite tight in the base game.

RATING: 8
Fun, fluffy, and quick. It's got the cuteness factor going for it making it easier to introduce... but it's got that subtle depth that makes you want to play again. And then there are the many expansions to add even more variety to the games once the base rules wear thin.

RATING: 7
A cute game that can be quite tricky. Avoid having too many animals, this is really bad as there is barely a chance to get rid of them. Some gambling is necessary when you have to make your decision which cart with animals to take, or when to take it. This brings good interaction into the game, as you have to observe what your opponents are doing.
With all this: The big excitement is missing. The game runs along without getting too boring, but also missing the "yes" moments.

RATING: 7
Played the 2 player variant - removed Chimp (can I perma-remove it?), Camel (moderately bad), Panda Bear (not by my choice). I would get an expansion with animal just to get rid of Chimp, since chimps, gorillas, and the lot are spooky.

Pros (2 player): Short, quick, simple, easy to figure out. Cons (2 player): The third truck complete useless in the 2 player game - never selected. Money was extremely tight, to the point where babies are a detriment (since you cannot get money if the baby is the last tile in the enclosure). Might get repetitive and boring? 

Overall: Set collection game with some luck. Favorite animal is cheetah! May player better with more players?

The following expansions sound cool: Petting Zoo

2015 UPDATE: Seems like a good family game!

RATING: 8.5
Solid family game that nongamers and gamers alike will enjoy. While the game is mostly a basic tile laying game, the money actions do bring some thought and depth into the process. Deciding how and when to rearrange your zoo are key decisions while making sure you will have the money on hand to pay for your 'remodeling' adds just the right amount of complexity for this level of game. The theme also means that any zoo loving kid will be more than willing to try this game.

But where are the giraffes??

It is outstanding, by far the most played, and most liked game by a wide variety fo people in the family.   You *can* teach it to new players and still enjoy the first play. You can play it with kids, or with adults, or a mix of kids and adults.  It's one of the only games that's great at each combo of player types.  You can even mix players of varying skill and still have a great game. This is simply the best, a must buy for families with non-gamer friends or those looking to mix kids 8+ into a game with adults.  It may be the ultimate game to play with your kids when family visits.   The theming is great, and really takes this game up from good to great.

I loved Coloretto, but this has just so much more (not least of which is theme)! I can't understand how a Coloretto fan could possibly dislike Zooloretto. The relatively simple rules and cute theme make this a perfect family game, and it should appeal to all but the most die-hard strategy purists: luck is just as present as it was in Coloretto in terms of the tiles drawn, but (unlike Coloretto)this can be offset by the various "money actions" that can be taken. The only significant complaints that I have about Zooloretto are that the boards are somewhat (but only somewhat) flimsy, and the cardboard bits weren't easy to knock out of their frames. And, just to contradict everyone else here, the two player game is great!....as long as you're using Michael Schacht's variant proposed at his web-site, not the two player rules in the rulebook.

Another game that's deceptively deep.  At first you're like, "aww cute pandas."  But toward the late middle of the game you're like "how the hell and I going to make this work?" Which is a sign of a pretty good game if you ask me.  Very nice production, it looks great.  Can't wait to spring this on the boy in a couple years.

6-yr olds (boy & girl) are loving Zooloretto & want to play many times. Took about 6 games for them to understand it well and begin trying a bit of 'strategy' - would have been faster than this but I missed and made a mistake with a few rules. They're probably ready to start playing with some of the expansions. Looks to me as though the boxed expansions are likely to be much more fun than the small one-offs (aside from petting zoo etc).

RATING: 7
Coloretto with animals and a very basic economic system on the side.

I actually think this is less fun than Coloretto. I find there is far less talking in this and it is easier to get out of a tight spot whereas coloretto is far less forgiving thus resulting in a more aggressive, noisy, and fun game.

That said I think this would be a great gateway game.

With the expansions it becomes a bit more interesting.

RATING: 7
Feels like a mix between Coloretto and California.  Zooloretto is very teachable and quite playable, but the randomness can grate if you have less than fast players at the table. California feels more complete as a game to me. I like its theme better, and I even feel that its theme is more tightly-integrated. It's also playable for mixed crowds, although not nearly as whimsically attractive. This makes me wish that Coloretto had something other than colors on cards to go for though, because it could do so much better in that department. I don't think I'd ever considered theme an issue for Coloretto prior to playing this game.

A good extension of the Coloretto mechanic; a little more complicated, but not TOO much so. Somehow, though, it seems to be missing almost all of the tension of Coloretto, becoming an activity that ambles along with little confrontation until it's through. I'm not saying I don't enjoy it; I just don't enjoy it a lot.

For theme and approachability, it is easy to see why this game won the 2007 Spiel des Jahres.  For those familiar with Coloretto, the primary game mechanic is well known.  As a board game, there are more options and this equates to slightly more strategic feel.  It is a tough call whether the board format brings enough interesting play over its predecessor.  Once item that was a pleasant surprise is the 2 player option that is available.  This variant is surprisingly tight and makes for a nice light 2 player game.  A worthy winner even if it is not a stand out strategy game.

Initial Play: Dec. 22, 2007
The game reminds me of Ra where you draw a tile randomly to change the lots available for players to take for free.  The main difference is that the lots are not auctioned off.  So what happens is that the player right after The next person can take up a lot for free.  So since the drawing player determines what sets of animals/money/stands are created with the tile they draw, there is quite a bit of kingmaking to do.  The drawing person is in a position a lot to make the lot good for one person or another.  Certainly the game is light enough and should be taken as so.  I will give the game another chance to see if I missed something.  I am caught in between playing it if someone suggested it to see if I missed anything and finding it very mediocre and not caring for it much at all.

I first played Zooloretto on its iOS implementation, and thought it is a funny and cute light game that one day I would play with my daughters.
But I soon realized there's more depth than I felt at first contact: the game is fast and apparently runs like breeze, but there's some meaningful decisions out there!
Now I got a copy in a math trade and I am eager to play it with real opponents...

Update march 16th, 2012: the game is fast and funny, even with 2. Rating upgraded to 7.

Initial Impression: This game has a very basic set collection mechanism. The solid components and animal theme work really well with children. Turns are simple and quick while the decisions are not too difficult. The game can be played with some indirect conflict and there is a light amount of player interaction. This game works wonderfully as a gateway.

Zooloretto has a certain challenge, is easy and plays fast. The artwork and playing material is of good quality. But it hasn't enough challenge, it isn't innovative enough to win the german Spiel des Jahres trophy. Now I've played it a lot of times with my family and I raised my score from 7 to 8 because it's just very family-friendly. Easy to explain, and most people (who aren't heavy players like it.

[b]Spiel des Jahres 2007[/b]
[COLOR=#959595][SIZE=7]Deutscher Spiele Preis 5th Place 1998[/SIZE][/COLOR]

[i]Posted: 2/21/10, Rated: 8[/i]

[i][thing=5782]Coloretto[/thing][/i] is a staple of a game.  It can be easily taught, and it travels well.  New gamers are intrigued by its novel card drafting mechanism where players don't keep cards they draw, but rather place them into sets on the table for someone else to consider.  [i]Zooloretto[/i] obviously bears some similar traits (heh, "bears"), but it wasn't compelling enough for me to try until it won the [i][geekurl=/wiki/page/Spiel_des_Jahres]Spiel des Jahres[/geekurl][/i].  I collect the games which win that award, so I dutifully picked up a copy.  Once I got past the sickeningly cute picture of the baby panda -- quite possibly the most over-marketed, and yet still overpowering animal archetype on the planet, like a furry Heidi Klum -- I found a very enjoyable game.

The odd thing is that I knew of [person=86]Michael Schacht[/person].  I consider [i][thing=491]Web of Power[/thing][/i] to be one of the finest Area Control games ever.  [i][thing=8989]Hansa[/thing][/i] is well constructed even if it's not compelling.  I shouldn't have been surprised when [i]Zooloretto[/i] offered a quality experience.  The drafting mechanism from [i][thing=5782]Coloretto[/thing][/i] is still present: each turn, a player has an option of drawing a tile and then placing it as part of a set on a "truck" for the other players to evaluate, or else selecting a truck without drawing a tile.  Side note: the racks don't look like "trucks," which is mildly disappointing.  And if that's all there was to the game, then it would essentially be the same as [i][thing=5782]Coloretto[/thing][/i].

[i]Zooloretto[/i] stands apart due to a simple, yet clever monetary system that has been layered on top.  Coins allow a player to expand her zoo, to swap creatures between exhibits and her barn, and even to purchase animals from her opponents.  Coins can be gained as tiles, by filling an entire animal enclosure, or when a player buys an animal from you.  What this additional system really does for you is create opportunities to postpone making a decision between drawing a tile or taking a truck.  If you don't want to advance another player's cause on your turn by creating a perfect set he could take then you may be able to delay, forcing him to create a better set for you.

This constant balance between draw, choose, or delay makes [i]Zooloretto[/i] a much more satisfying game.  Each move is significant.  The artwork is attractive and highly saturated.  The theme is very family friendly.  It's almost sickeningly sweet, which is a drawback for me, but then there's that baby panda that always draws me back in.  If it included baby koalas as well, then [i]Zooloretto[/i] would be unstoppable.

RATING: 7
It's a near perfect game for the target group that the Spiel des Jahres caters for, and you only need to observe young 8-year old (female) gamers play with the tiles and zoos, even without any rules or fellow players, to realize how well pitched it is. Games that do so well with the younger crowd, and are still of some sort of interest to the more seasoned gamers, are perfect prize material. Couple that with the ability for the industry judges to put both Michael Schacht and Abacus in a long overdue spotlight and you have the 2007 winner. The year that Knut ruled Germany, and had Zooloretto expansion written all over him. 

Near perfect for its target audience, to which, I must add, I don't quite belong. And still it is pleasant enough, in a going through the motions sort of way. Cute and interesting without being too taxing. It has been a perfect gift for the more reluctant gamers families we know, and their homes are the setting in which I expect to play this game quite a bit. And given the apparent enthusiasm of the new owners, in that setting, I also expect to enjoy it thoroughly.
 
It has some interesting placement decisions, some great poison-pill opportunities, some unpredictable luck and chaos that I have no problem with, some interaction, some headology, and some surprises.

The problem, to me, is the "some". I am looking for truck-loads, and somehow, this ticks many boxes, but excels in none.

I do like the added mechanics that have transformed Coloretto into a solid and well thought-through boardgame. The 'tiles on truck mechanic until someone caves' is one I always enjoy. All the genuine pleasure I get from this game is in the truck seeding phase, trying to figure out how other people tick, how you can balance the sweet and the bitter in such a way that you end up with most of the sugar.

But you can only be as creative as the tiles you are given, and a lucky last draw for the last truck in a phase can turn someone's zoo set-up from decent to bloody brilliant and back, all without the application of any particular skill except maybe rough and ready odds guesstimation.

The baby-bonus for matching males and females, the tightness of money, the ability to acquire stray animals from other player's pick-ups that might be crucial to your chances to pull a win out of the bag, they all add dilemmas and opportunities in places where you wouldn't expect them, adding welcome layers to a pretty basic game.

But I never can quite escape the feeling of inconsequentiality of it all, even if that might be too strong a word. So whilst it might be perfect for the right crowd (an unreserved 8 to 8.5 for families with youngsters between 8 and 12), and one brilliant introduction game to get the reluctant gamer's attention, I personally do feel slightly underwhelmed by it all. But the underlying game is solid, the truck mechanic is darn attractive (even in 2-player mode), and it is all... well, cute and inoffensive.

So all I need to do now is await the inevitable official expansion set that brings in "some" more of the missing "some"s. Some more interaction, some more screwage, some more depth. It looks utterly expandable, and given its success, it is only a matter of time.

Players try to build zoo by acquiring animals from and filling up the pens (to score points) - while avoiding acquiring animals that do not fit in their particular zoo's theme and relegating those animals to the 'holding pen' (loss of points).  Light cutthroat action as animal trade/stealing are present.

Pros:  It has an auction mechanic without being too much luck.  

Lots of different moves to pull at any given time.

Cons:  
Have to rule-lawyer with the manual at least once a game, with all the different situations involving money.  This never goes over well.

The two-player game is more-or-less a duel, with most of the challenging decisions made for you.

I bought this game for my daughter's birthday since she loves playing Zoo Tycoon on the PC and she loves the Cranium game Zooreka.  Zooloretto has been one of our favorite family games.  It's a little more complex than Zooreka but my daughter (who has been playing since she was 6) loves it and wins quite often.  I would rate it a little higher if it didn't take so long to set up and start each game.

A good light game.  It plays nice and quick.  It seems to serve as an excellent gateway game, and the women in my family really seem to have latched onto it.  It's quickly becoming my most-requested game.  The one drawback is that each game can feel shockingly similar to the last game you played.  The decisions you make each time feel like routine after you've played a few games.  Still it's fun if you keep it to occasional gameplay.

There also seems to be some kind of point ceiling in the game that you can't break.  So if you reach a certain number of points it seems you're just playing a game trying not to hurt yourself.  And it almost seems to discourage hurting your opponents because there isn't a good way of dealing with animals you don't want, so if you take something your opponent wants you'll just be hurting yourself.

This is definitely a fun one to play with the kids.  I've played numerous times (not all recorded plays) with my daughters and my niece and nephew.

This game is OK.  I'm not a huge fan of the mechanic, but we generally have fun playing it.  The kids have a little trouble grasping the scoring of this game, so maybe it would be a little more fun if they understood it a little better and played accordingly.

(KIDS) It's a very slightly more involved Coloretto and a decent game.  However, since I've played Coloretto plenty, I found this to be fairly uninteresting.  For a game that is supposed to be approachable, I found that the scoring is not very straightforward at all.  In fact, it's much more straightforward in Coloretto.  It's fine and I'll try it with my kids, but I'm not impressed.

WOW - what an elegant nice game.  Very good quality.  And quite a bit of strategy for an unassuming family game.  The whole family enjoyed playing it and we got through our first game in about 30 minutes.  (My wife wins first game again - I need to stop this trend!)

This is the kind of game you add to your collection just so you have a light, but strategic game.  You can play with children or non-gamers while still feeling like you are getting a decent dose of Euro-strategy in at the same time.

Zooloretto, or "The Knut Game" as it was quickly baptised (after the little daft polarbear in The Berlin Zoo, that in 2007 got truckloads of attention for just beeing cute...hooray for marketing). The game that is loved by many and hated by even more. I, on the other hand, fall into the first category. This game is not NEARLY as innocent and cute as it seems. It's just as much about wreaking havoc in your opponents zoos, as it's about making your own camels breed.

Not much of a game here, really.  The decisions are fairly obvious and there really didn't feel like there was too much competition.  Still, a colorful game, non-brain burning.... probably fun for kids.  Only major complaint is that a player's score is easily calculated, and so with some of the screw-you expansions you can always bring down the leader... what ought to result is everyone having pretty much the same score at the end.  Would be nice if some of the score components were somewhat hidden or unknowable.

The artwork is a tad too childish for my tastes (and for the game mechanics), but the game play is good. The bits are nice. I think Coloretto, due to it's simplicity and ease of portability will win out in the long run with us, but Zooloretto is a nice addition none-the-less.

EDIT - Upgraded to an 8.  Looking into expansions now.

This game is very cute, and more interesting than Coloretto despite its identical mechanics (baby pandas beat chameleons any day!). But with two players it's not too exciting. Sometimes, though, a quiet, reflective, and pretty game is what you want.

RATING: 7.5
Very pleased to see Schacht get the Spiel as I do enjoy a lot of his games but, on first impressions, I'm not sure that I don't enjoy Coloretto more.  Time will tell whether the superstructure really is strong enough to support this more complex version (though complex is a misnomer) but it is at the least a decent light weight.

Gah! This was the SdJ winner? I played this once and was totally bored - again, this is the sort of soulless, mechanical, themeless, minimally-interactive game that causes people to doubt German games. Would not play again.

This is very much Coloretto, the board game - boring, little control, no theme, no interesting player interaction, downtime problems, overly mechanical - but it takes longer to play and is overproduced. Where do I sign up?

RATING: 5
To me, it took all of the great parts of Coloretto and tossed them out the window.  The game is no longer as nasty, as there are multiple ways to get rid of stuff you don't want or rearrange them so they don't hurt you so bad.  It also seemed incredibly easy to get enough animals to fill your pens; not much of a challenge.  After that, you're just trying to avoid crap you don't want until the game is over.  Overall, I'd much rather play Coloretto, although I can see Zooloretto much better for family play.

I really like this game. It has some stuff to think about: it's puzzlish, has a fun take-that element because you can put crap on a cart that you know your opponent wants, and has a really fun push-your-luck element ("one more draw, just one more") Great intro game for non-gamers and kids as well.

A new take on the Coloretto mechanics. It's got a lot more going on, but that doesn't necessarily result in a better game. It lacks the elegant simplicity that makes Coloretto one of my favorite games. But it IS a decent game. As with Coloretto, this game is as nice or mean as you make it. And the meaner the better! However, the addition of money, barns, and extra pens means that what's harmful isn't as clear-cut. Sometimes you'll do something to hurt someone only to realize that in the end it helped them more than harmed them - so it doesn't quite have the same screwage level as its predecessor. It's a good game, but it feels like there are many other games that fill this quick/light strategy niche better.

Coloretto fleshed out to make a medium length board game.  Coloretto is more portable, zooloretto is more fiddly.  The money actions are a nice addition. Sufficiently different experience to playing coloretto that you should have both if you liked either one.

I lowered the rating after playing Aquaretto.  Aquaretto is the game that Zooloretto should have been.  If Aquaretto was released first, there would be no Zooloretto.

This game was a lot more fun than I thought it would be.  I have a hard time getting my family to learn new games, and this one was easy to learn, easy to teach, and took less than an hour to play the first time, including scoring. (Our family tends to take a lot longer to play than the estimated playing time on the box, so this was a big plus.)  Everyone thought the theme was cute, and both my son and his grandma loved it.  I can see why it won Spiel des Jahres; it really is a great family game.

Good game. I can see what all the fuss is about now ... Only a slight bit more complex than Coloretto but somehow alot more fun. I imagine a very good gateway game. I ordered this 3 months ago, just because my girlfirend loved coloretto, and while I was waiting for surface mail to deliver it from Germany it was nominated for and won the Spiel de Jahr ... Now there's a spot of luck. Update: Dropped the rating to 7.5 after a year and dozen or so plays. Doesn'y quite hodl the interest as much as other gateway candidates such as TTR.

If I was a kid, I would probably grade it at least twice as high simply because of the cute animals and the rather lighthearted gameplay. But for me as a "serious" gamer, I don't think there is much to do in this game which in my opinion isn't much more than Coloretto with a board - but it takes longer quite a bit longer than Coloretto so I'd always prefer to play the latter if I had to make a choice. The strategy in Zooloretto isn't deep; set-collection with a big chunk of luck. Luck is definitely not my cup of tea, but the luck aspect means that it's probably a great strategy game for kids. I don't need to ever play Zooloretto again.

Takes the excellent game play of [gameid=5782] and expands it tremendously.  The ability to eliminate negative points, or to transfer items between characters, is a huge boost to the game, and allows you to take more chances.

Getting coins (and lots of them) is key to this game, as it opens up your options for much more strategy and planning.

This game is very enjoyable.

Going to play this a few more times before passing judgement on this but right now, there doesn't appear to be much here.  It's not hard to complete your enclosures and it basically boils down to who has one or two more chits in the barn to decide the winner.  

This is feeling blah.

I had played Coloretto a number of times before playing this, so learning the board game version was a snap. This is an equally worthy game! Where Coloretto is stripped down to the core choices of card placement and row selection, the board game version adds some extra factors that actually add to the game instead of just adding decoration. This is a great "family game." I rate it initially as a "7" because there's a lot of competition in this weight of a game, but I'll play this anytime someone else wants to play.

A cute resource-management game with a zoo theme.  Draw tiles and decide which truck of tiles you wish to take, placing animals or vending carts in your zoo.  Do you grab the truck before someone else does?  Do you spend money to expand your zoo? Not too deep a strategy game with enough luck-of-the-draw to make it interesting each time.

I enjoy this game but would rather play Coloretto. Although there is nothing wrong with this game it just doesn't do anything for me. Its just ok. I will play it but dont think I will suggest it and have no clue how it won Game of the Year...well maybe cause it is a family friendly game. I think it just didn't live up to the hype.

I'm not sure what the base game alone would be like, but I will probably avoid it like the plague after this uninspired slog. Essentially: Coloretto three times as long and one third as fun. I tied for first in a five player game without making a single non-obvious decision the whole time. Blech.

I like Zooloretto. Its theme is appealing to both young and old. It reminds me of Alhambra in terms of the aim of the game. Instead of building majorities you try to fill your cages. Unlike in Alhambra you don't buy tiles but you can choose a wagon with up to three tiles on them which you put in your zoo. All in all, mechanically, Zooloretto is a lighter version of Alhambra. As such I like it a lot. It involves easier decisions and thematically attracts more people. Staple in my collection

Played 7 times. The concise rules and zoo theme help a light feel to the game, but it rewards thought, offers tricky plays and even a touch of resource management... Sometimes players face difficult choices but not leading to A/P... Performs well with 5 players without bogging down, fast turns, finishing under an hour.  Played with 3 players, felt the same.  Nice components too... The wooden trucks and money are excellent. The tiles and boards are good quality with pleasant illustrations. (Tentative observation: It seems that an aggressive anti-opponent strategy leads steadily to failure.) It takes a little set-up time (a bit like Entdecker). Update: I don't seem to be bringing it to game night.

I got this one for the animal theme, because it won the Spiel des jahres, and because I had played Coloretto and enjoyed that system.  We have played it a couple of times with the kids, and it is just on the upper edge of what they can grasp in terms of strategy and complexity.  They either take a truck the moment that it has something that they want without waiting for it to fill up, or they load it up with something super tempting without thinking that someone else might want it.  I can see with time and practice that this one could work well though.  Plus, I didn't realize that I had gotten the german only version.

Even though there are more options in Zooloretto than there are in Coloretto, I don't find those extra options necessarily more interesting.

Play it cut throat... sabotage those trucks, even if it puts you at a disadvantage.  You will find a much tenser game in doing so.

Quite nice as a closer at 11 pm before going to bed. Decent family game but nothing overly exciting here.

RATING: 9
In the family game category, in which the goal is for kids and adults to both enjoy the game, Zooloretto is the best.
The goal is to create the best zoo. You draw a tile representing an animal and load it onto a truck headed for the zoo. You later take the truck, fill your zoo with the animals, and proceed from there. There's more to it than that, however, which makes the game compelling enough for adults. The kids like the game because of the zoo theme and the simplicity of placing tiles in the zoo. But even experienced gamers have found this game challenging, especially with the five possible money moves that can alter the zoo.

"Meh" I think prefer Coloretto.  I played Zooloretto with 5.  It seemed to lead to a fair amount of downtime while each player scanned everyone else's zoos before placing each tile.

A perfect "Family game"  Playable and winnable by a 7 yr old.  Very fun boardgame version of Coloretto.   It gives pain as to what to take when.  Nice scoring mechanic that looks to keep games real close.  a 10 based on the 1st play and very worthy winner of 2007 SdJ.  Added to collection 7-5-07.

RATING: 4
Well... what to say. I've played this game a few times now, mostly with non-gamers. This is clearly a family game, so let's focus on that aspect first. Compared to Coloretto, Zooloretto achieves this by removing the aspect of suits of different colours (a.k.a. animal species) costing more and more points the more you have in a single type. Instead, a fixed amount is deducted, no matter how many animals of an unwanted species you have. Then there are a few additions to be able to move animals around and / or steal them from your opponents. This allows you to focus on your own little game while, from time to time, smuggle a strange animal into your own cages. The result: friendly competition. Non-gamers like the setting, are mellowed by the young critters, and generally appreciate the low-intensity game flow. Viewed like that, ok game.

For gamers however the much more lenient malus points have effectively removed much of the game's bite, making it slow, dull and boring. Point totals are nearly always within close range simply because there aren't many ways in which they can add up. There is not much tension, and the subject matter with all its little extras to enhance the experience becomes a hindrance rather than an asset. Coloretto is in all ways imaginable the superior game. 

Finally, I've played both the original Zoloretto as well as the Dutch release Burgers' Zoo. I'm rather sorry to say that the latter is not a particularly nice game to look at. Graphics are childish, bland, and impossible to mix with other extensions. The 'special variant' conceived for this release plays out with difficulty, and nets the player a disproportionally small reward. Yet it is for this variant that the original's cute kitschy design was abandoned. It's that I got the game for free, otherwise I'd never have added it to my collection as-is.

The rating is for Burgers' Zoo given experienced Coloretto players; add 1 point for the original Zooloretto design.

I was fairly impressed by this game. It's simple enough that kids would seem to be able to play it and yet it has enough strategy that I don't think adults would grow tired of it after a few plays. I like that it has a "push your luck" element when you are taking the trucks especially. There are a number of interesting decisions that you are forced to make regarding where to place your animals or if you should spend your hard-earned money to adjust your zoo or potentially steal from an opponent.

Rating after 1 play with 3 players. Surprisingly easy to learn. Played quite well with our 7 year old tonight. Great pieces, fun mechanics. Lots going on while still being simple. I'd give it a 10 if it didn't take so darn long to set up thanks to having to sift through all the pieces! Also, I read the rules for 2 players and it sounds like it would be a really lame game with only 2 players.

I like that this game has a little of everything - planning, bluffing, stealing, etc.  The components are nice, and every game will be different.

The game has a bit of a puzzle aspect near the end, as you try to determine the optimum moves to inch your score up just a bit.  In general scores will be very close, so every point counts!

This has a strong interactive element and works great for families or as a gateway game.  It fills a special niche in my collection and I really should play it more often.

Easy learned and fast paced game, great to play with families but still give some gaming feeling. But prefer Aquaretto more since it adds some more depth to the game with the meeples and free placing of animals.

9 might be a bit of generous ranking, but I liked the game.  After a few more plays it may settle in at an 8.

This one won awards in 2007 and has sat in my game closet, unplayed, for a long time.  We finally broke it out last night and really enjoyed it.  

It has a classic balance of tension in collecting animals, sticking it to your opponents, nuanced switch-a-roos that no one sees, and quick to learn.  I really enjoyed this one and plan to play it more.

Components: Great artwork on sturdy components.  Visually appealing.  I like the wooden trucks.  The zoo mats are attractive. I dislike the player aids and the plainness of the money.

Experience: In some ways very similar to California, which I didn't enjoy, but Zooloretto's theme adds to the enjoyment.  The divide-the-pie mechanism of loading the trucks is fun, trying to build lots attractive to one's self, or trying to entice others to take specific trucks.  Most of the placement decisions seem straight forward, though.  There's no spark here for me, but it is mildly engaging. If the theme of Zooloretto were pasted onto Coloretto, that might be a winning combination for me.

The game of passive aggression. Great fun to stick exactly what your opponent doesn't need on a truck. Almost as good to know when to take a truck that is not great, but not bad as it is to take a partially empty truck. Easy to teach, for the most part a very social game.

It takes a few plays to get the strategy of this game. I like the game play, but it is actually quite abstract, very Euro...the zoo theme is irrelevant. Once I realized that it didn't matter if I had zebras or monkeys, I began to wonder if the original Coloretto wouldn't be better, tighter game. I feel like each round of Zooloretto plays too long for what it is. The game isn't as popular in our house as I thought it would be.

The weird thing with this is how close the scores always end up.  Also not completely convinced by how restrictive the rules are on moving your animals around - it feels like it would be deeper if there were more options.  But still like this.

I feel that Coloretto, while good, needs just a bit more to it to take advantage of the interesting basic mechanism. Zooloretto adds just enough to get there.

Put me in the camp that prefers the simpler original game, although Zooloretto is neither complex nor disagreeable. For one thing, deciding on the proper truck in which to place a tile is much less crucial than in Coloretto, as Zooloretto provides many opportunities to deal with unwanted junk, sapping some tension from the game.

RATING: 9.5
This game can either be really really friendly or horridly mean. You're filling up trucks with randomly drawn animal tiles, and then taking trucks to fill up your zoo's enclosures. Maybe you all agree that everyone making the best zoos they can is the way to play, or maybe you decide... I notice you have no place to put this zebra, so I'll put it on the truck with the animals you desperately need, so that you'll lose points for having an animal you can't do anything with.

It doesn't hurt my opinion of it that the first time I played, 3 out of 4 of us tied in points and in coins (the tie-breaker if points are even), so only 1 person lost, and now they refuse to play it even again.

Accessible smooth game that's pretty much a perfect family game. (And by family game, I mean a game that can be played enjoyably and reasonably independently by kids with their parents, not the operative Geek definition of family game, which is "less deep and complex than Puerto Rico.") Because of the placing of tiles on trucks that are available for other players to take, you really do play other players. This makes it a much more interactive experience than many other Euros. Great theme also helps to explain why the game won SdJ.

I work at a Zoo, so you'd think the last thing I want to do after a day of work is to come home and play Zoo, but I really like this game.  It's lite fun, but there's still a little challenge.  I haven't used the big expansions yet, but I'm sure they'll add a lot to the game.  One thing I've noted is that when playing with 4 players, the turn order tends to be pretty rigid.  I'd like to try a 5-player game just to see if that changes.

A great adaptation of Coloretto.  The theme works well in the game and you can play it with nearly any audience who likes lighter games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A good game that can be enjoyed by both the family and geeks - the latter may prefer just breaking out Coloretto, which poses all of the same questions without so much expensive cardboard. 

Components and graphics are both good and give the game lots of 'kid appeal' - but don't be fooled by that there is a game of strategy in there. It's pretty easy to vary play style to take advantage of opponent screwage if playing with the grown-ups or ease back on that side when playing with the kids.

Add 1 to the rating if playing with family/kids.

This scores a point higher than Coloretto as there is more strategy, control, and fun packed in it. It has a colorful playmat, wooden ships, money, and tiles instead of cards.  So, for me, this feels more like a game with some strategy...albeit not as much as I like.  It plays quick, but I'm not sure it is quick enough to classify it as filler.

Ultra-cute boardgame version of Coloretto.  Players take an action - draw and place a tile on a truck, take a truck, spend money.  The idea is to take trucks full of animals and squeeze them into your Zoo.  If you can get your enclosures filled up without too much diversity, you'll score well otherwise the penalty points begin to kick in.  Nicely illustrated with cute animal tiles.  Nothing too taxing here - slots right into the light filler boardgame category.

This one is what I recently described as "[thing=5782][/thing]'s larger cousin".  Yeah, some similarities, but truly a different experience.  I found that since I don't play this game with any degree if regularity, I run into moments where I feel like one or two little "gotcha" rules emerge.  Very "cutesy" in presentation, and definitely marketed for families. Overall, a solid, non-confrontational, light game with the right dose of "screw-you-partner".

Pretty bland game, unless you really like the zoo theme.  I'm not crazy about the coarse scoring system.   In the end, less is more, and Coloretto is much faster implementation which captures the essence of the system better.

There's a good amount of sabotaging your opponent and the money actions are good.  For 2 players we play the variant where people can buy more than one expansion.  We also include all but 2 of the animal types.

2017-12-09 : Played it again and the same pattern repeated itself : the game starts out as "oh, what a cute kid's game" and ends with "damn you bastard !" Hiding underneath this cute looking game is a dastardly in-your-face cutthroat game when played with heavy eurogamers. The beauty is that you can also play it in a non-seriouos manner with kids, using the exact same rules. Upgrading this to an "8"

A lightweight set collection game.  Probably some good ideas and originality when first launched, but newer games do the same thing much better.  Just not many choices to ponder and the availaibility of the animals comes down to luck each turn.  The only real decision is usually when to take the truck as zoo re-organization can be too pricey,  Probably good to introduce newbies to set collection games, but I don't think will be replayed that often.

[3 plays] Great theme, great bits (especially in the later printing which features much heavier stock for the zoo boards and adds player aid cards (listing the financial actions) and a tile bag).  The biggest challenge added here that wasn't present in Coloretto is having to use turns to do the financial actions, while delaying taking a sled.  I feel like I'm still learning to find the right pacing on that.  The one thing that worries me about this game is that it might be subject to a sort of calculational slowdown of the endgame that I dislike.  Have to play more and see how it goes.  Certainly a good game for play on multiple levels--the rules are simple enough for the kids, and it could be played as just light family fun at the zoo, or with a more analytical and card-counting approach.

Juego muy divertido y original.Se trata de gestionar tu propio Zoo y para ello tienes que coger camiones con varios animales e ir colocándolos en los diferentes recintos para hacer el Zoo más valioso de todos. La dinámica de "subastar" los camiones es de lo más divertido del juego.
Para ganar: intenta no coger animales de muchas especies pues te penalizará¡ y sobretodo intenta completar los recintos más grandes, las ampliaciones del Zoo te permitirán llegar a sumar más puntos que ninguno. Tener bastantes monedas al final para recolocar tu Zoo es también clave para intentar ganar la partida.

2007 SdJ winner, good gateway & family-friendly game, although some of the rules can confuse non-gamers, and I don't find all the options available to players very intuitive.  

Another alternative is [gameid=34194], which has a dolphin on the front cover (my daughter would love that) while Aquaretto adds some good decisions, it is more "gamey" and unnecessarily complex, and less suitable for children.

Also own: [gameid=66120].  This is a simplified version of Zooloretto, and arguably even better for kids.

Played 2 times with 3 and 5 players. This is a VERY light tactical game involving set-making and set-collecting. I don't think a lot of people have communicated just how light this is. It is a very good game for a younger family, a good game for slightly older families and non-gamers, but it is very simple. Graphics are great, and the game fine, but I can't see wanting to own this myself or ever suggest to play it. Still, my 7-year old nephew loves it, and I like that it can be played by even young kids without being totally uninteresting for adults.

Hard to believe this edged out Notre Dame, Thebes and Imperial for the SdJ.  In a year of great new experiences for me, this happens to be one of the dull ones.  I would rather play Coloretto the 4 times we could manage in about the same time one game of Zooloretto takes.  Dunno, seems dry and doesn't force me into much agony when choosing what to do.  Components are nice, theme works but game fails to lift.

Unless you need those baby animals, get Coloretto instead.  All those tiles vs a nice deck of cards is just fiddly, a lot of the simple tension is just lost in Zooloretto.

The perfect family game. It's like Coloretto on Mountain Dew. Just a little more added to add some more decisions. Still a simple game to teach and play. Actually, I think it's even easier to teach and more intuitive than Coloretto. Every single person I've taught this to has asked to play again immediately. Probably my most loved light boardgame.

RATING: 7.5
Initial rating was 6.5 after one play with 4.  Everyone filled up their enclosures rather easily and without a large number of extra animals.  Seemed a bit too easy, but that may be perfect for a family game with kids.

Next play with 5 players was improved.  Money was more scarce, several enclosures were uncompleted, and lots of animals were left in the barn at game end.  Bumped up half a point. 

Played with 3 and the opportunity for clever play using turn order revealed itself.  Rating is improving with multiple plays.  It probably maxes out here or at 8 out of 10.    

Two more plays - holding steady at somewhere between 7.5-8.0.  Three new players all enjoyed the game and asked for a repeat play.  It continues to become more evident that vending carts are key. 

Two more plays with kids.  Very well received.  Even fun for me.  Not enough variability in gameplay or scores to merit regular play with adults, but fun to bring out every couple of months.

PRO - Cute set collection game.  My kids enjoy it, although I think all the scoring options are hard for them to keep up with. I could see this being a 'warm up' game for a group of adults. It's a hit with most female gamers.

Not a bad game, but it didn't match up to my expectations.  I was looking more for a Zoo-sim kind of game, but this is a pretty simple set collection game with a pretty production wrapped around it.  Maybe this is better for kids as I found it to be a bit strategically lacking.

I don't really know how to rate this one. It's too light for a 9 or 10, but 8 might be too high - yet, I really enjoy the game. I usually reserve 8-10 for games with a bit more strategic depth, but this one is intriguing. There seem to be just enough decisions to keep it interesting - yet, it is a fast-paced game. I know few other games that have gotten as many plays in the first couple of weeks after I purchased it. So I'll give it a "provisional" 8.

Looks the goods and will likely get more plays (31/12/08) Update: I feel I should like this more, but I don't.

Maybe ok intro game to non-gamers or kiddies, but there are just better games to play - rating from 7 to 5 (29/12/10). UPDATE: Ok, so I think the 2007 Spiel des Jahres game just ain't good.

An excellent evolution of the Coloretto system.  Zooloretto offers the same tense decisions of its older brother but adds many more elements to be concerned with, without becoming bogged down and made to feel sluggish.  the game moves quick, and although light, offers many decisions to make, and the ability to pull off some clever moves.  A great opener/closer to an evening that gives you the time frame of a fller but the feel of a substantial game.  Easily plays under it's posted time on the box once all players are comfortable withthe rules.  

UPDATE: My initial impressions were a little inflated.  Zooloretto is a good game but does not equal the elegance and simplicity of it's origin.

Barn animals are a$$holes.

Longer and more fiddly than Coloretto.  However, I really like having size limitations with the enclosures.  You can't keep collecting a set like Coloretto, because it will eventually cost you.  Also, buying from another player presents a nice decision - is it worth it for me to help that player out?

This is one of my husbands favorite games.  With the animal theme my kids love it too.  Unique tile placement strategies make it much less a kid game than it looks.

We also got Aquaretto & a few expansions but they are going to be birthday presents for Dad.  I'm sure they will make the game more fun.

This is a fun family game that is easy to play and plays fairly quick. The components are well made and look great. I must admit that I was hoping for a bit of a meatier game. Hopefully, some of the many expansions will fix this and make the game a bit more enjoyable. Don't get me wrong. It's a very fun game, just not as good as I thought it could be.

For me I rate it a 6.5, but for families with children I would rate it an 8.5. The kids will surely love all the animals.

While I don't think this is a bad game, to be honest, I would rather just play Coloretto.   Having money actions and birthing animals is amusing, but I am not sure if any of this adds any to an already good card game that plays quicker and feels more tense for some reason.  I am happy to give Zooloretto another go, so maybe my opinion will improve.

This game is petty much the perfect example of a game that is very simple to learn but hard to master.  The rules are such that a child could pick them up (indeed the age range is 8 and up) yet there is enough strategy, backstabbing and planning ahead required that gamers will love this game as well.  Nice and short at about 45 minutes a game this is not only a great non-gamers game (or intro game) but it's also a great filler game for between games or while waiting for the rest of your players to show up.  I am impressed.

Compared to Coloretto, Zooloretto offers a little more decisionmaking, a little more variety, and a little more thematic charm.  These virtues are offset by more rules to teach, more pieces to set up, a longer playing time, and a much higher purchase cost.  I think Zooloretto is the better game, although Coloretto represents better value for the money.  As a family game to play with children, there's no contest at all - Zooloretto is the clear winner.

Schacht games seem to Just Work under the right circumstances. And when they don't work it's unclear how they ever might have. In this case, I have trouble seeing how this would ever be better than Coloretto, or what the extra rules are even meant to add. I bet more plays would have made me understand, but life is short.

Zooloretto resembles a good pop song; melodic with a catchy hook, plays quick, leaves fond memories and can be enjoyed repeatedly, if not overplayed.  Bruno Mars rather than Beatles, this one falls squarely into the category of family game.  It's simple enough to be played by younger members (my 8 year old liked this one), with enough choices, dilemmas and strategy to engage the more cynical oldies too.  And the hook?  Well, everyone loves making babies, right?

Rating reflects play with mixed group.  People that normally don't like confrontational (fun!) games will probably play this with you.  Evenso, it is some fun on it's own, without this criteria.  You can be as nice or cutt throat as you like.  For example, you can load a turd animal someone doesn't want onto a truck you KNOW they're going to take.  ;P  Or take that truck out of spite before they can.  Heh, or be nice.. your choice.

This one just doesn't work for me. I liked it well enough, but it didn't seem that great or interesting. Like several games that have come out in the last year or two, this one seems like a reorganizing of previous mechanics without really adding anything new or innovative. It's nice enough for what it is, but overall, it leaves me flat. It takes the basic idea of Coloretto and builds on it, but not significantly enough.

Played this at MeepleFest.  Really couldn't see any reason to buy this, since I have the card game.  The basic mechanic is the same and I really didn't feel all the added trapings of the board game version did anything to improve the game, just made it run longer.  The card game is a pretty decent filler, but I'll pass on the boardgame.

A light and pleasant set collection game, Zooloretto has players trying to fill enclosures with similar types of animals. To add interest in the process, there are delivery trucks where players can either draw an animal tile from the bag and place it on one of the trucks or take a truck with the animals currently on it. This is a wonderfully physical representation of "pushing your luck." The game is relaxing to play and has pleasing components. Additionally, Zooloretto scales very well. Michael Schacht offers an engaging method on a classic mechanic.

With very similar mechanisms to Michael Schact's previous card game Coloretto, this is a relatively simple set-collection game based around zoo animals.

Players take it in turns to either add animals (at random from a bag) to the available trucks, modify their zoo using money actions, or take one of the remaining trucks and add the animals to their zoo.

The game can be a fairly cut-throat too, with players trying to screw each other up by putting different combinations of animals on the trucks. 

A worthy winner of the Spiel Des Jahres.

Zooloretto is a derivative of Schacht’s popular card game Coloretto.  Players collect animals and assign them to various enclosures in their zoo.  The challenge is to collect only the animals desired, and properly position them in enclosures in order to attract the most spectators.  This is not an easy task, as the delivery trucks often contain an assortment of animals, some of which may not be the species you desire to exhibit.

Zooloretto is perfectly suited for families and gamers of all experience levels.  The animal theme is certainly appealing, especially to children, but the choices to be made are significant enough to engage adults.  It is exactly the type of game that is deserving of the Game of the Year award.

Pretty decent family game that probably owes a big part of its success to the accessible theme and cute animals. No real tension or excitement, not much for gamers. It's inferior to the less successful "California" (same designer, similar mechanics) and "O Zoo le Mio (same theme).

wow, this was very boring.  Grab a truck place them in a pen.  Maybe move from pen to pen, grab another truck.  Thought it would be good for the family.  They said it sounded boring when I was showing them how to play and they refused to play.

One of the few games, I've ever traded away.

+++Added Comments+++

I wholeheartedly disagree that it's good for children. With the 'stealing' it too cutthroat and the rules on moving animals around cages is to convoluted for kids. (Plus its so damn dry and mathematical) And based on not being good for kids, means it's not good for families. Josephine couldn't figure any of it out and isn't quite a horrible gamer and it was too restrictive for Lillian to enjoy. And even though that both LOVE animals, the theme was not felt AT ALL in the game play, so it didn't give them a good feeling.

I truly believe that Zooloretto is another one of those games that 'gamers' feel it has a cute feel and they like it, so it can be forced onto kids and spouses.

I have mixed feelings about the game.  The (pasted on) theme is too silly to be a serious game, but its pretty dry for a family style game.  It was OK and I would play it again, but definitely not my favorite.  The tile drafting/boat taking mechanic was a little interesting.  The luck doesn't effect it as much as you think.  

I have a genius idea to re-theme this sucker.  Instead of animal pens, you are a human resources director hiring new employees and storing them in cubicles!

Played it with 2 players and liked it.  Important to get many vending carts, because they're worth 2 points (per type), plus they assure you of 1 point per animal in an enclosure.  I'd like to play with more players, to see how that changes the balance of the game.

Not bad at all. I expected Coloretto (a pretty good game) loaded down with a lot of superfluous crap and cutesyness. It is a little more complicated, yes, and bit more cutesy, but it has a nice long-term arc that Coloretto just doesn't have. Whereas in Coloretto you have three rounds, separated by deck shuffles and restarts, you get a much larger "deck" of tiles here, resulting in a leisurely building of your plans over the course of the game. But most importantly the tough decisions and nastiness of the lot choosing mechanic are still intact. It worked in Coloretto and it works as well (if not better...? we'll see) in Zooloretto. Color me surprised and impressed.

Cool implementation of the Coloretto mechanic into a board game. The art is really nice as well. It has the same amount of tension in choosing where to place tiles on the trucks, but it kind of suffers in the tile laying portion of the game. Your choices aren't as easy there and can hurt you a lot. At least there are ways to try and fix things (ie. trading or swapping animal pens). It is easy to see why this won SdJ.

After trying this with a few other players, I like this game in both the 2-player variant and normal iterations.  There is a lot of chaos to try and manage, especially in the larger games.  Trucks get flooded with animals that you have to make the most of, and money becomes even more critical.  There is a lot more to think about as far as weighing in who might want which animals and what trucks to place them on.  Yet I also like the 2-player version because there is some bluffing and a lot more wiggle room, especially since money is more plentiful and you can each have two expansions.

Overall I am happy with this purchase.  It's easy to teach and learn and can be played with just about anyone.  Yet with how light it is, there is a surprising amount of management and depth to be had.

Si: es Coloretto "el juego de tablero"... pero no se queda sólo en un juego de cartas sobreproducido. Es bastante matemático y con cierta interacción. Más que un filler pero más ligero que un eurogame medio, lo que le sitúa en el nicho de "eurogame familiar". Buenas ideas la situación y gestión de las áreas del zoo, así como el dinero y lo que puedes hacer con él. PROS: sencillo, accesible para no jugones y bastante dinámico y de duración ajustada. CONS: quizá Coloretto no necesite mejorarse complicándolo. A veces parece más un "problema de matemáticas" que un juego.

[ENG]

Yeah... It´s Coloretto, the boardgame, but it´s not only a overproduced cardgame. It has a good mathematical component and a bit of interaction. It´s between a filler and a average eurogame, so it´s a "game for the family". The management of the areas and the money actions are good ideas. PROS: streamlined, can be played by non-gamers. Adjusted time lenght. CONS: Coloretto might not need extra complications.

First played June 14th, 2007.  This is a quick learn (5 min) and quicker play (~30min at least as two player)  It has some decent strategy and a fair amount of luck.  I'd like to play with more people before suggesting it.  As a 2-player game, I'd play something else.

Based on playing a 2-player variant, the game is really simple and tight. Forces you to place tiles in the barn and making some strange but strategic moves. But I can imagine the game blossoming for the 5-player game. As it stands, for a 2-player, 6 is the limit.

Just played this game for the first time. The game is pretty fun! Easy to play and still need some tactic. I read about it tho and people say that this game gets a bit boring after a while and that i should try Aquaretto, the more tacktical version of the game. But for now i just gonna give Zooloretto a couple of more tries. 

Played it 4 times now. Still same as first. Light game, easy to learn and play, fun. 
I think im gonna try this one with some more people cus we only played the 2 player version uptill now.

Great family game that starts off easy going and quickly turns quite strategic. euro style scoring elements has you making decisions that can effect you at the end of the game? do you want to take an animal to keep it from someone even though you don't need it? do you expand you zoo. tons of options.

A lot like Coloretto. Quality of the board & bits is very good. My kids like playing Zoo Tycoon on the PC so I had expected they would leap right into this game, but it hasn't taken off.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I got this thinking it would be an easier, less abstract version of Coloretto but I find preferring Coloretto more and wishing we were playing that instead of Zooloretto. The animal theme makes it easier to introduce to people though and draws them in more than cards that all look the same except for their color.

I always tell people that when they sell an animal from their barn, the animal is really being processed. That usually greatly decreases how many people take that action. Especially if you keep pointing it out and making them feel bad for even thinking about doing that.

RATING: 5
A boardgame version of Coloretto that isn't a cashing on a brand. Nice clever game. On the other hand this is deeper than the original but at the same time it loses some of the clearness and elegant simplicity of Coloretto. Zooloretto looks like a simple, silly game of managing a zoo, but underneath its light-weight image is a surprisingly challenging game of resource management and decision making.

While I enjoy Zooloretto, I found that the real attraction of this game is the distribution of animals. Given that there are two spin-off games that both put that mechanic to the fore, I don't really have much interest in revisiting this one for the other mechanics that it has to offer.

Rated based on one 2-player game and one 4-player.  Definately more fun with four.  Nice family game and tile implementation of Coloretto.  The money actions give a bit more depth to the game and add the potential for clever/nasty plays.  The barn gives flexibility but, careful, also offers opponents another way to obtain needed animals.  Rating will probably rise with more plays.

It definitely has the feel of the card game Coloretto on which it's based by the same designer. However there are more things going on... and more ways to mess up other players, which all makes for a longer game than the card game. I need at least another play to see how I feel about this one as I really love Coloretto as a filler, but Zooloretto is too long to be considered a filler, and not as easy to teach to non-gamers.

This is cute and cuddly. It has a slow start but the simplicity and the constant struggle to try to keep your zoo looking as perfect as possible somehow draws people in. Everyone I've played this with has enjoyed it. It's just the right sort of depth to play with family whilst having a laugh around the table and complaining that others have stolen your truck. I'm not at all suprised that this won the spiel des jahres even though I love Yspahan (it's rival)and the cute theme doesn't hurt either. Who doesn't want to make little baby panda's?

RATING: 5
Update: After a couple more games of this, I am rapidly tiring of it. Personally, I have no great desire to play Zooloretto anymore.

-----

Very nice, new "version" of Coloretto. Compared to Coloretto, Zooloretto adds a cute theme, improved components and mechanisms and generally much nicer and more satisfying gameplay. The money actions in particular add a whole new layer to the gameplay, or a whole new dimension of decisions, if you will.

My experience so far with Zooloretto have been good; it's certainly not a heavy-weight gamers' game, but as a family game or a light/middle-weight game for gamers, it fits nicely. It's easy to see why this won the Spiel des Jahres against the competition it was up against.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Anything with a zoo has to be great!  Players stock their zoos with some degree of resource collection and press your luck.  Players gain points by getting collections of animals without getting too much in terms of numbers and variety.  The combination of these makes the game tense, with many decisions.  My children like the theme, but they are not the best at strategy.

I suppose I'm not the target audience, but I just didn't see any reason to play this game again as opposed to other set-collection games -- it doesn't have anything unique about it that grabs me.  Except for the cute little animals maybe.  Perhaps I'll feel differently when I have an eight-year-old.

Rated as a children's game; 6.5 otherwise. Not bad by any means, but for adults lacks soul since it's basically coloretto with a bunch of tacked on euro-mechs from other games (coloretto meets alhambra). But watching a smart 8yo play, it offers much more intellectually interesting decisions than others children's games with a theme they like. A true Gateway!  My wife won't play because "zoos oppress animals." I rate her 2 as a wife.

Bought this game for myself and my family.  

If you can get past the kiddie image on the box, you'll be pleased with a well-thought out game which presents a few interesting choices.  

This game is NOT Agricola or Puerto Rico with respect to the myriad choices you are presented.  It's NOT Twilight Struggle; it won't take three hours.  But the game IS a lighter game suitable for young and old alike.  I'm using it to turn my seven- and six-year-old on to games, and I'm playing it with my board game group as well. 

Don't let the box or the theme fool you, there is the potential for screwing the other players with this game.

Along the lines of Yspahan and TtR, Zooloretto offers mild to moderate depth and planning through minimal choices. On your turn you can pick a tile to place on a truck, select a truck, or perform one of five(?) money actions.

Zooloretto's theme of zoo-building, I think, can turn children on to board games. I'm sure planning on exposing this game to my daughter, who at age seven wants to be a "zoo veterinarian."

Zooloretto is a fun little game about getting the right combination of animals to fit inside your zoo. The game is easy, the only hard part is deciding what you may or may not want from the draw tiles.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fleshes out the basic mechanics of the card game admirably to deliver a legitimate, full-fledged family board game. It really is very similar to the card game, though, if you want to save space or have other gateway board games you prefer. 

UDPATE: I held on to this game for a long time until my kids were older. There isn't enough going on in this one for my game night crew, but I was hoping this might see family play. However, I taught both Coloretto and Zooloretto to my family and they all preferred the card game. Go figure. I do think that Zooloretto gives you a lot of box for not a lot of game and I agree with the family. Also, more and better family games have been published since. Downgraded my score on this and am selling it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very nice! I like how you have to decide if you want to wait that next turn, or take the animals NOW before someone else does. Also you have to manage your Zoo (well, this is not a business simulation, mind you) and try to get the best out of what you are offered.

A very nice family game and if you have kids around, an instant win!

RATING: 8.5
[3 plays] An interesting variant of Coloretto. The zoo theme works for me and I think it integrates well. The monetary aspect makes for more interesting decisions, and there is good strategy possible to alleviate the effect of the luck.

A fun game that is easy to pick up & learn.  I suspect that there is a more complicated side to it, aside from picking your trucks/ trades at the correct time, but we were able to enjoy it without needing to continually check the rules or worry too heavily about strategy.  The rules were simple enough, and relatively complete, which meant that we could focus on the game itself.

My opinion of this one has fallen a bit (down to 6) due to the advent of the superior Aquaretto (rated 7), which does everything Zoo does and better. The fixed pens make the decisions a bit easier here. I also find the component quality to have been lower in Zoo, at least in my set: while my Aqua tiles are still fine (and should be) after 2 plays, my Zoo ones show a good deal of wear and scuffing.

As a long-time fan of Coloretto, I was interested to try this one, and was pleasantly surprised with how much I liked it.

I like this game, but it comes across as being more complex than it really is, which makes it harder to teach than Coloretto. Also, with more players, coins can create a competitive imbalance depending on when they are drawn, as I've seen players tend to consistently take them regardless of their utility (in my experience)

I definitely like this more than Coloretto, mainly because there's a little more going on.  To me, Coloretto felt inconsequential, while here there are some decisions to be made.

I think this would be a good game for families and kids, though not necessarily offering very much challenge to the gamer.

At first I thought it was a different game than Coloretto, but ultimately its the same game, with a few more actions added to it. For a filler, the rules are pretty simple however there are some exceptions (fiddly bits) that must be remembered. It okay, it plays in about 10 minutes, and there's not much thinking involved.

In my opinion, a bit too light for the SdJ.

This game is growing on me. I found it boring at fist, but now having played it with the kids a few times, the subtleties are becoming more apparent and it's fun that they're not beyond my smart 7.5 year old. The graphics are good, the pieces are simple, and I still haven't figured out the "best" strategy -- it seems to fluctuate more with this game based on the actions of other players than most games do.

Zooloretto is a fun family game with big beautiful tiles and a nice large board for each player.  I wish the "trucks" looked a little more like trucks.  It's an interesting decision on your turn when you choose to either take a truck and end your part in the round or if you choose to add to a truck and possibly give someone else a better (or worse) truck to choose from.  Having to downscale certain species of tiles based on player count is a little fiddly.

A boardgame version of Coloretto that isn't a cashing on a brand. Nice. On the other hand this is deeper than the original but at the same time it loses some of the clearness and elegant simplicity of Coloretto. Animals on the boards are a slight bit harder to follow than colors and the setup and clearing the game can take a whopping amount of time. Coloretto is a much more unforgiving game and 2-player game of this one isn't worth much. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Solid game with 3-5, a good mix of cutthroat and push-your-luck, which I love. With 2, it's a much nicer game, less about blocking than about optimizing. 

However, the money actions bother me and bog the game down, which I think make Coloretto the better game.

RATING: 7.5
This one is a nice gateway experience.  I won't pick it to play with gamers but with family or friends that aren't up for the medium or heavy stuff this one is a nice choice.  It's cute to look at and is fun enough to play.  It doesn't take long to get through a game but feels a bit deeper than most gateway or card games.  All the scores end close which I don't know if that is the sign of a good, tight game or the sign of everyone just does the same thing.

Finally got this played with the family.  The rating of 7 is as a family game.  I'd probably rate it a little lower if it showed up at game night, although it's short enough I'd be willing to play it.  My kids beat me at this all the time and my six year old plays optimally most of the time.  I don't think there's much meat to the game but there's enough small choices to keep it interesting.  It could even be a nice gateway game for non gamers.  But mostly it's a kids game...

Nem tetszik a kép a dobozon. Nem tetszik az állatkertes téma. Azért leültem játszani. A játék mechanikája nem rossz, vannak benne jó ötletek. Sajnos két fővel nagyon kevés a konfrontáció, az interakció, hátha több fővel izgalmasabb lesz. Mondjuk valahogy nehezen tudom elképzelni, hogy a feleségemen kívül ki ülne le ehhez a játékhoz. Kicsi gyerekeknek izgi lehet a témája, de nekik meg talán nehéz a szabályrendszere. No majd még hátha előkerül és számomra is kiderül, hogy milyen fantasztikus játék ez. :)

The samey tiles and busy-looking playmats make things slightly too much to keep track of in a large game, and the zoo complexity doesn't add much. The core dilemma-building of Coloretto is still there in the middle, and I think I'd rather just play that.

I prefer Aquaretto to this one but ultimately it was Zooloretto Dice that replaced it for me.  Some of the Zooloretto expansions weren't that good though Exotic had its moments.

REPLACED BY:  Zooloretto Dice.

I was oddly underwhelmed in my first two plays, both fairly recent. I enjoy Coloretto, which gets sporadic play. Zooloretto isn't bad, it just doesn't seem as interesting. Not sure why yet. Two plays later and it seems a little more interesting, but I still prefer Coloretto.

I'm a big fan of Coloretto, and this 'sequel' of sorts doesn't disappoint. The money actions add a few extra tactics that make it worth picking up even if you have Coloretto, and the cute-factor can come in handy when trying to convince recalcitrant lady-types to play.

Despite it's childish look, there's a lot of tatics in Zooloretto. A good game to introduce young people to the hobby, BTW. I've had more success with it than with Ticket to Ride, so far. 
The expansions add to the replayability, specially the new buildings.

One of the first modern board games my girlfriend and I ever tried, at Snakes and Lattes in Toronto.  Loved it then, still love it now.  Might even say it's our favorite game to play together.  Only wish is that there was room for a little more deep strategy in the two-player variant.

RATING: 7
A decent good set collecting game, with enough cuteness for non-gamers and enough nastiness for serious players. Luck does have some effect, but the odds can always be estimated, so it's really just a matter of risk management.

Very nice light-strategy game that has great visual and theme-related appeal.  It's a perfect gateway game that is still quite entertaining for more hardcore gamers as well.  Definitely deserving of the SdJ.

RATING: 6
Zooloretto is a simple and somewhat interactive (by virtue of the community use of the trucks) Euro that certainly deserved its Spiel des Jahres award. For its gameplay alone I would recommend it as a gateway or family game. However, the consensus here at BGG seems to be that Aquaretto builds a better game out of the same mechanic, so that might be a better purchase. Also, the expansions for Zooloretto are both small and ridiculously expensive. This is a shame, because the base game screams for expansion animal packs. Once you get past the "gateway game" stage there really isn't much reason to get the base game to the table, which is why it's no longer on my shelf.

Too many cardboard pieces that do not go together when you add in expansions. They could have made it work much better. Love the theme, wish it was easier to keep everything separate for the different number of players, also the draw string bag is practically useless.
Very cool how it can be combined with Aquaretto too!

Great lighthearted game. Amazing spatial elements that go perfectly well with the flavor.

Nicely developed boardgame version of Coloretto. Although the game has its merits, I prefer Coloretto. **** First game (with five players) ended with a disappointment, as the last player had to decide which of two other players would win (doing "nothing" and player A wins, maximising her own points and player B wins - she couldn't win herself).

Very accessible family board game.  Limited depth but still a hint thinking/planning.  Good with non gamers and crowds who prefer lighter games.  It doesn't add a lot to the basics of what Coloretto is but, being a board game instead of just a card game, it's less portable, longer to setup and longer to play.  A nice game, but Coloretto is probably sufficient.

Disappointment. Aquaretto was so much fun that I thought this had to be at least pretty fun.  I thought it would be a simpler Aquaretto.  Nope.  It's not simpler, it's just more annoying.  Very annoying mechanics.  You can only put so many of a certain kind of animal in a given area, 4, 5 or 6.  So the whole game is trying to maximize these areas and moving animals around into different areas and freaking out about running out of space.  You get pretty much no points for less than a full amount of animals, but you lose points if you have animals you can't put in.  Just not fun.  Aquaretto's mechanics are so much better.  Even the trucks are not fun in this game, you can't really "get" the other person as you can in Aquaretto because there is not as much incentive to take a truck with more than one animal.  Why this is rated higher than Aquaretto is beyond me.  What a bad game.

I've only played this two player, and I think it would be mildly better with 3 or 4, but the boring annoying mechanics are still there, so I don't see a big improvement.  If you're thinking about getting Aquaretto or Zooloretto, get Aquaretto!!

This is really only a moderately souped-up version of Coloretto.  I happen to like Coloretto and have a 9 year old daughter who loves animals (particularly baby animals).  This game hits the spot for some light family gaming for me.  Do the new mechanics add much to the basic Coloretto engine here?  Not enough for me to justify the game's purchase price for that reason alone.  A few extra mechanics, baby pandas, and the possibility of playing it with my daughter have sealed the deal for me.

I don't know.  It was alright.  I had higher hopes for it.  Went over very poorly with my group.

I prefer Coloretto... much simpler, much more fun, much more strategy. The "add an expansion part" makes it unbalanced and ugly. It's all "fluffy" and easy to learn in some ways, but the "money actions" add something I can't like. Still, my cousins (the smaller ones) like it and think it's somewhat of a nail-biting experience. 

Coloretto is Expresso, strong, plain, fulfilling in every way. 

Zooloretto is Capuccino. I've never liked Capuccino because of the whole foam thing, and the fact that everyone thinks it's "hip",

Even though it's a bit fussy in places (I still need to sit down and read the rules about bonuses for filling a pan again), I think Zooloretto is a very nice game. The cute factor is beguiling, and goes a long way toward explaining how Zooloretto won the SdJ. 

The core idea of building lots of items from randomly drawn tiles is quite nifty, too, though. There are just enough twists – gendered animals who produce a baby when you get the right pair together, money and commercial stands which ease the requirement to fill your stalls – to keep things from getting too obvious.

The biggest problem Zooloretto has is the set-up time. There are an awful lot of bits to wrangle for what is, essentially, a game in the same niche as Carcassonne. I suppose Ticket to Ride and Settlers of Catan are just as bad, but for some reason I notice it more with Zooloretto. As it happens, most of my Zooloretto play has been on the iPhone app version, which is fairly well done and nicely sidesteps this problem.

I'm curious to try out some of the expansions, though, in order to see what directions they've gone in. I could easily see them making the game a bloated mess, but they could just as easily add a bit of depth, which would help me deal with the complex set-up and break down time.

Basically a tricked out Coloretto variant with an added module. The wooden trucks and money discs are unnecessarily thick, and the animal tokens especially with the baby mechanic makes the theme come out a lot stronger. The money actions besides allowing you to potentially take undesirable tiles or letting your opponents take tiles you want only to buy it back from the later also allows for situational stalling of seeing how the trucks change before you decide. The negative points for only each type of tile you have in excess makes switching from different animals (or colors) easier I think. The game is a bit longer with only a bit more added depth, and there isn't two modes of play, but I think i still enjoy Zooloretto a little bit more than its predecessor.

Fun! Nice decisions, and Quick. A kids game feel, but for adults (I think). Kids love this too, especially the fluffy panda on the cover.

However, I am downgrading my rating here - because it is just too annoying to keep track of the constantly changing rule set. Seems to me that you shouldn't be changing the rules to a game AFTER it has won a prestigious award. We've locked our ruleset in *now*.

I haven't downgraded this further, but the constant release of expansions, new tiles, and convention tile giveaways has taken more of the sheen off of this game. It's too difficult to keep track of now and the game itself just seems all over the place - so much effort just to figure out which sets to play.

Fun game I first played with all adults (taught by 
[geekurl=/user/darthnice]darthnice[/geekurl]) - enough strategy and depth for anyone to enjoy.  Fun to play with kids as it is very imaginative, three simple options per turn, and very little down time (there is always something to do).

Set up can take a while if your game is not organized.

RATING: 8
Interesting game, does fit style for SdJ winner. First play seemed too awkward for kids, too weak for adults, but might yet make a good family or gateway game. Update after a dozen games - wow, it's a huge hit with the family after all, not awkward at all after one or two plays. They love the animals, adore the offspring, and occasionally like snagging what their sister wants to take! Two thumbs up, rating from 7 up to 8.

I love this game!!!  Finally something more interesting than Candyland that my kids will play (ages 5 and 3).  My son, who is 3, has difficulty grasping the rules of course, but he did manage to beat us all in our first game.  My adding in the expansions, it really is a great adult game too.  Definitelt recommended for a family game.

RATING: 6
This is actually quite fun, and a good gateway game. 

I like the coloretto-mechanic, and I think it's one that designers should be aware of, when toying with random drawing of cards or tiles in other games.

The isometric drawing of the zoo and the barn is awful.

I am trading Zooloretto with the expansions that were included in the box when I traded for the game in a math trade.  All of the expansions are DIY by the original owner.  They are very high quality and printed/pasted on to floor tiles, giving them a very heavy feel.  I am only looking to trade the entire set as a unit.

Delightful board game variation of Coloretto. You choose sets of tiles to build the most attractive zoo. Unfortunately, just as in the card game, your opponents put the sets together, putting things you don't want in with what you do. The pieces are nice quality, the art is great for the theme, and there is the added fun of having baby animals if you get a male and female in the same pen.

I find this game elegant, with a lot more strategy than there appears.  I find myself drawn to the idea that I should never have animals that I don't have an enclosure for.  This is probably to my detriment.  I enjoy that on my turn placing tiles, I only potentially affect mine or anybody else's fate.  Someone still has to choose those tiles on the cart, and it could be me.

Oh, bummer. I'm a big fan of Schacht, and of Coloretto in particular. The transformation of that little game into this bigger franchise wasn't a direction I felt it needed to go, but then it won the SdJ! Fantastic, and it promptly went on my wishlist, and I received it as a gift from my family. What a disappointment to find I didn't like it any better than I thought I would. My daughter likes it, though, and maybe I should try with my wife sometime. (Either that, or I should sell it sometime when they aren't looking...)

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Recommended to me like this: "Ignore the cute panda on the cover -- this is a game about screwing your friends early and often." And it is, in a largely lighthearted way.

Zooloretto shines not only for its theme and enjoyable screwage level, but for packing a lot of game into a relatively short play time. Unless you're very careful, it ends before you've had time to do everything you need to do in order to win -- it forces you to think carefully, but also choose your moments to take a gamble (generally by either taking a light truck or waiting for a more full one).

I also love that although one person often takes an early lead, and though that lead tends to persist through the midgame, it's entirely possible for other players to catch up and win -- provided they haven't made too many bad choices.

Zooloretto is quick to learn, and every single person I've introduced to it has enjoyed it.

This is a game where the bevy of little expansions significantly enhance the replayability and strategic depth of the game. The base game by itself would get a 6.5 to 7, but with the little expansions, particularly the Petting zoo and Mission cards, I think the game really is quite good. I like the graduated complexity because it allows a lot more flexibility as to when the game can be brought out to play.

Fun, pretty family game but a little fiddly (though compared to Agricola, very straightforward). Especially true of games with less than five players, as you have to remove animal type(s). Player order important here; weak players often inadvertantly set up gift trucks for the following player. Really don't like the fact that everyone has their own boards; it gives the game that simultaneous solitaire feel as well as being 5 times as fiddly! Also, the scoring is obscure and feels like accounting; we're frequently surprised by who ends up winning. We give out lots of prizes apart from most points: most babies, most different types, least different types, most food stalls - regardless of the result, everyone goes home happy!

"Chaque joueur possède un zoo, et marque d'autant plus de points qu'il attire de visiteurs. Pour cela, il faut des animaux nombreux, des couples, des troupeaux, des bébés.

Quelques boutiques à la sortie du zoo peuvent aussi être rentables. Le joueur ayant le plus de points à l'issue de la partie est vainqueur."

Plays very similar to Coloretto with a board.

RATING: 8
A surprisingly popular family game.  Got this in a G4GG lottery.  My son loves to play it.  Cuteness factor is high but there is some cutthroat potential, especially with fewer players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Basically a trick taking game with different species of animals instead of different suits of cards.  Every round the players draw tiles and load up trucks.  You select a truck and place the animals in your zoo and gain points for collecting certain numbers of like animals and lose points for animals you can't fit into your exhibits.  

Overall it's a pretty easy game to play with a cute aesthetic, simple scoring, and some fun mechanics.  

My only criticism is that I think it's not the most replayable game.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great game, combining elements of Rummy (don't get caught with tiles at the end!) with worker placement, light buying and selling, and a risky backwards auction mechanic. I really like this game, so does my group. And with so many expansions, we pick and choose the game we want to play each time with it. That, my friends, is the hallmark of a keeper to me.

This is a decent game. It's fun and I'm glad I played it. I like it about the same as I do Alhambra. Good game, a little light.

Update: I just can't get into this one. I like other SDJ winners fine, but this one bores me to tears. Maybe I need another play for something to shine through.

why make a bad version of colouretto?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Game in a Nutshell: A semi-basic set collection game where you bring in animals to your zoo and organize them into the best fleshed out attraction.

Played as: 5 player

Pros: Cute theme and simple idea make a seemingly easy game to play for fun.

Cons: The game is bogged down by too many decisions because of all the taped on additions. Needed to be streamlined to keep the game flowing and less AP prone. Boards become a clutter, further adding to the problem, by making it hard to survey things quickly for faster decisions.

Other: For me it's easy to favor Coloretto over this as it it's basically the same exact premise but not unnecessarily complicated by a couple tacked on rules and remains simple, fun, and fast-moving.

Best Use: A cute game when players want something slow moving but don't want to think too much.

All those cute little baby animals.....

Simple rules, easy to explain...Try to fill up your pen with the same type of animal in each pen. Everytime you fill it up, you get points. Animals that don't fit in any of the pens penalize your score. You can use money to buy animals from other players, get rid of unwanted animals, buy one extra pen, etc. Easy to explain and enjoyable for nongamers as well. Some serious gamers find it a bit simplistic.

Rated as a kids' game.  

October 2011: rating lowered to 7.  This game has caused more tantrums than any other game we've played as a family.  The theme is attractive, but the mechanics cause lots of angst with our kids and the gameplay is not deep enough to satisfy adults.  I'm not sure what the ideal age is for this group.  To the trade pile!

I thought they did an impressive job of taking the core Coloretto mechanics into a board game.  It "seemed" easier to be screwed with the luck of the draw and what other players happen to want during a round (especially the later rounds) than in the card game.  Might not be the case since there's a new money action that provides some flexibility but since the game isn't as abstract I think players tend to pay more attention to what you are going for and will try harder to mess up your well-laid plans.  Rather play the card game at this point but look forward to giving this another try.

Quite good. Not deep, but a solid family game somewhere in the neighborhood of Bohnanza. Player interaction via stealing animals, but there's probably more to the placement of tiles on the trucks than is evident the first time around. Still, nothing that's going to have you sleeping on the couch. Looking forward to playing with the expansions.

 The theme is cute to make people interested.  It is a good game but doesn't seem to have that same fun feel of other gateway/family games.   You can play nice or vicious by messing up the trucks the other player is obviously stacking for themselves.  Extra marks for being a fairly quick game too.  Some of the money rules can give light gamers some trouble.

Brings a bit more depth to the Coloretto mechanism.  I like that there is a bit more player interaction than with Coloretto.  And, I like the theme more.  However, there is a good bit of extra length to get that, and I'm not quite convinced it is worth it.  I think in most cases I'd rather just play Coloretto, but I'm usually down for a game of this when I'm looking for that little something extra.

I felt a little bad for having maligned Zooloretto in the past, so decided I really owed it an honest play.

A lot of "chrone" and not much substance.  Prefer the original Coloretto.

Good family game, boring strategy game. With the extra options to postpone pulling "cards" you can delay your choices until they are at a maximum benefit. Colouretto is much better because you cannot avoid drawing cards or making a choice of which line/boat to take. I really wanted to like this game but it is too easy to score well in. My one play of 3 players ended up with point totals of 36, 35, 35 and around 36 is the maximum possible score.

Very interesting. The tile-pulling part reminds me of Ra, but I think it's handled better here than in Ra. In Ra, you're absolutely and completely at the mercy of the tiles whether you can help yourself or hinder other people. Here, you have more freedom to set yourself up and to slow others down, and the little "stealing" mechanic that lets you buy up the leftovers from the other players gives you even more control. I like this better.

Inherits the fun Coloretto system and adds an additional economic element. I think Coloretto is better because the cards are easier to read than the animals in Zooloretto, the economic element in Zooloretto seems like a gratuitous complication and Coloretto is much more portable. However, I like Zooloretto's theme and relatively simple mechanics because they appeal to non-gamers and older kids.
Updated to an 8. At first I thought the "money action" was just a mechanic tacked on to the core Coloretto system. After a game of Zooloretto with adult players I've been impressed by how the money action adds a whole new dimension of tactical choices to the game.

RATING: 6
Moderately fun gateway Euro game. The theme and simple rules make this a good game to introduce kids to the hobby. Ignore the 13+ age range on the box - any bright 8 year old should be able to handle this with no problem.

This could also be a decent party game, if trying to do a game night with non-gamers. But the Twilight Struggle/Brass/18xx crowd will find this a little bit on the light side.

RATING: 8
This is a fantastic game for youngsters with just the right amount of interaction for them to get the idea quickly while posessing enough subtlety to keep them coming back. Limited replay value for adults but if you want to get your kids into Euro games, start here!

The winner of the Spiel des Jahres in 2007. Based on the mechanism of Coloretto, players collect animals, vendor stalls or money . The animals and vendor stalls fit into a player's zoo, and money can be used to expand the zoo, or buy animals from other people's barns. A zoo only has room for a few species, and overflow animals fit into the barn, where at the end of the game, they count against your score. The more animals of the same species that a player has, the more points they earn. It's a cute game, and plays fairly quickly.

Familygame with capital F. Does not add sufficient to Coloretto to tickle my fancy, Coloretto is a good game and Zooloretto adds nothing but pointlessness and takes away the feeling of pushing your luck. 

Edit: Gets worse by the play, dislike is growing. Bleh. I now also officially hate pandas...way to go Michael Schacht...

2-player/spuseliness: Well someone could be fooled into thinking it could be a good game to get your other-half into gaming by introducing them to Zooloretto. Don't, there's much better gateway games.

Coloretto with 30% higher complexity and 300% higher price.  Pointless.

RATING: 7.5
The central mechanism here, which allows you to either add a tile to a set or take a set leads to a game where every turn is potentially agonizing. There's a push your luck element, made more interesting because your bad luck often becomes an opponent's good luck. Cute bits, easy gameplay... a great SdJ winner.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Zooloretto does a great job of taking the basic gameplay of Coloretto and turning it into a fun, nicely-themed game which was very worthy of winning the SdJ. I look forward to trying out all the expansions as, for me, the more options the better.

A game with little choices and too luck dependent, so not the sort of game I prefer. But its "disadvantages" have a nice side effect: even my small daughter can play it! This is the only reason I play it, even too much (it is getting really boring).

At first, I didn't get all of the SDJ buzz.  The game just didn't seem that exciting.  I think this was partly due to the fact we were playing two-player games to begin with.  The game definitely hits its stride with 4 or 5 players, and the expansions definitely make it more enjoyable.

Wow! I really like this game. I finally picked this game up and my first play was with my 6 year old daughter and 78 year old grandmother. My six year old flat out beat me by 3 points. She caught onto this game almost instantly and completely hosed me during the second round by taking a truck full of animals I needed. I never expected her to see that I was working on elephants and zebras and nab that truck. She grabbed the truck and started cracking up immediately because she knew I needed that truck. 

The game has simple yet elegant mechanics and it helps fill a hole I have in my gaming collection: family / gateway style games that are actually interesting and engaging for all ages. I simply cannot wait to play this game again!

Theme is great, very cute, but may be a little too simple for me. Aquaretto adds more strategy.

RATING: 7.6
For a game that is ostensibly geared at children, this one still manages to be interesting to adults.  I'm always surprised at the positive reaction this gets at game night.  The rules are very simple to explain, and the scoring is such that no one every gets left in the dust nor too far ahead.  There are some subtle opportunities to interact with other players as well.  This is a great family game.

Why they made Zooloretto with jaguars instead of lions in the first place is a mystery. What zoo, for their big cat exhibit, says, "You know what people have seen too much of? Lions, that's what. Fetch me jaguars instead!"

Clear to see how/why this one won the Spiel: It's a quick family-style game with as much cooperative and/or cutthroat play as you like, but not a ton of absolute shivving.  Fun, colorful, and reminds me of a few other games that I'd prefer playing, such as Medici vs., Carc, or Ra.

Coloretto with theme (a theme that works very well!) and very few more things.

Edit April 2014: I dropped my rating half a point. I think the game offers some interestinf decisions, but not many of them, but otherwise it is very basic and doesn't have much more.

Not a bad option for non-gamers, but not great either.

(I own a Finnish edition)

This game takes basic mechanic from Coloretto and adds some spices around it. Additions actually work very well and it is a very good family game. Maybe not as elegant as the card game but a very good game as well. Works well with whole 3-5 player range.

Kiddies zoo-expansion works very well with 5 players and adds some more money into the game. Probably better with 5 and less so with 3 (too much money comes into game).

Very good game. An interesting re-imagining of Coloretto, and a better game. It stands on its own merits. The game adds a strategic depth to the tactical play that appeared in the original. The use of creatures and vendors brings the game to vivid life. I simple adore it.

The Coloretto mechanism repacked as a nice light boardgame. Too long with five players, and not enough variation in final scores between players. Probably a great spouse game since there's very little direct confrontation.

The best part of this game is the Coloretto mechanism, in which case it would probably be better just to play Coloretto. Zooloretto reduces the "nastiness" element of Coloretto and adds a very nice family theme. A good family game, but not much going on here for the more serious gamer. I've reduced my rating  since playing this with two players, which really doesn't work. (6.5)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Development of Coloretto that apart from balancing the luck element in the draw adds as well a bit of interaction and some bonuses to think more about what to pick up. The way these small twitches improve the game speak very well of the designer's craft: both games still have the same backbone, but Zooloretto is more solid and ultimately more replayable.

RATING: 5
Malgrado la vincita dello Spiel des Jahres del 2007, non mi seno di dare più di 6 a questo giochino. Tipico family game rivolto ad un pubblico giovane: con animaletti da collezionare nel proprio zoo e meccaniche immediate. Il gioco risulta semplice ma non banale con un ambientazione chesoddisfa solo l'inizio della partita, verso il finale si abbandonerà l'espansione dello zoo per passare a spostamenti di chioschi e gabbie solo per far soldi e punti vittoria. Presente, nella pesca delle tessere, la componente fortuna; ma in un gioco di questo livello ci sta molto bene.

RATING: 6.5
It's best not to take Zooloretto at face value, for it can be a truly nasty little game. I don't know what sort of families surround those who describe this as a light, family filler, but I doubt I'd want to meet them. The added flexibility is a diversion, although it's probably mathematically proveable that it detracts from the gameplay. The smart production values are a winner, but is it really a step onwards from Coloretto? I think not.

it is a 6 - 7 for adult gamers...it works - but I'd rather play Coloretto if I want a similar feel (but faster).

My 9yo son LOVES it! He's already eye-balling the expansions. It is a great game for my wife, son, and I to play and he's already teaching his friends.

I will jump at the chance to get it to the table if he or my wife asks...but will be less enthusiastic if a buddy sees it on my shelf and enquires about it.

Had a first game. My younger daughter didn't manage to get into it at all, I think she might have some difficulty grasping the tactics involved. She hated it and she cried, which was a first. I don't think she cried cause she wasn't doing very well, cause she doesn't do very well in other games as well and she enjoys them nonetheless. I think that she cried cause she was so utterly lost with respect to what she was supposed to do. My rating may be biased and I will certainly give it another try but for now I'll stick with the low scoring.

[b]Zooloretto[/b] was traded away in a math trade 9/14/14. (Received Thebes)
Received in a trade(6/22/14). 
I traded away Cockroach Poker, Haggis and Legendary Fantastic 4. 

Updated thoughts and rating ([COLOR=#FF0000]6[/COLOR]):

[i]This game started off strong, but after the initial 3 plays my daughter was really the only one interested in playing. We tried it with 2, but it fell flat. I wouldn't recommend it with 2 players, I think you need at least 3 to make it interesting and it's best with 4. 

I really enjoyed pulling the animals out of the bag, placing them in the trucks and having to decide when to grab that truck versus pushing your luck for one more turn. However; after that the game got kind of boring. Placing your animals wasn't that exciting and I hated how artificial it felt to build the carts in your park since they only gave you points based on a set collection mechanic. We also have Zooloretto Dice and it is one instance were I think the pared down version of a game is much better.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]The dice game plays much quicker, plays well with 2, still has beautiful components and manages to capture the feel of it's big brother (especially the tension in deciding how to split up your animals in the trucks and when to take a truck versus pushing your luck and rolling more dice). 
Highlights:
- Theme really comes through because of the art/production.
- Awesome family game that plays well with 3 and 4, haven't tried a 2p game yet.
- Simple mechanics that work well together and still offer some difficult choices to make each turn.
- Filling the trucks with animals: this is the meat of the game to me, when do you take a truck and when do you push your luck and hope to draw another animal you really need. Of course then someone else can snatch that truck from you.
- Coins: they help you have more control over your zoo and move animals around or buy them from other peoples barns.[/i]

Love this game. It's fast moving. High fun factor for my group. The rules seem a little complex at first, but after one game you'll have them down.

After playing the base game a few times, this is how I felt: eh! Am I missing something? What's with all the hype about this game? I like the bits, silver money tokens, and the collecting of animals...but it leaves me wanting more (feeling like is that it...it's...over?)

Ok! Now having played the expansions to this game I like this game and am playing it again! The real game comes with playing the expansions! My wife and I really don't even consider playing without them! Achieving the correct balance with the expansions added in is a little tricky, but the Zooloretto website does have some tips for combining games. The one thing I am always a little confused about is the ratio of tiles in the bag with each tile addition. Other than the base game, Zooloretto Exotic explains a little about the ratio of new exotic animal tiles with certain numbers of players, but I believe all other expansions do not clarify this. And yet nearly all expansions add tiles to the bag, thereby making for a longer game.

One way we enjoy playing is a base 2-player game with all expansions. This way the savings expansion isn't too overpowered. Except it is because the tiles in the bag are endless and by game end everyone has purchased everything possible with a pile of left over money. I feel like the starting pile of end game tiles should be doubled or maybe tripled to balance this problem. Not sure though.

6 rating is for adults.  The game is fine, but why not just play a round or two of Coloretto and then have plenty of time for something more fun than the OKness of this game?

However with my kids -- 7, 5, and even the 3-yr-old when we're not playing too seriously--this is an 8 or 9.  They love the theme.  The strategy is just right for them to stretch and learn as they play.  They even develop individual styles of how much risk they will take, table talk trying to convince each other of things, how much they will think about sabotaging the others while placing their animals in the trucks, etc.

RATING: 8
  A great family game.  Play time fits the game.  A decent amount of interaction and conversation between players.  The last turn of the game can be a bit harsh until you've played the game a few times.  Scales well from 2 to 5.

  My favorite part is when no one wants the animals in my barn, and I get to talk about making panda slippers and flamingo hot dogs, while loading my virtual shotgun (Chck Chck!)  :D

I would really describe this as a gateway game but, having said that, remarkably heavy on strategy. I can also see that this will increase in complexity of mechanics and scoring once the expansions are added to the base game. I have since increased my ratings of this having added some expansions. It is a marvelous game.

Coloretto delivers the same gameplay just as well (and arguably better), and at a fraction of the price and play time. The level of randomness means that Coloreto is the better game due to its shorter length.

Coloretto with a lot of extra pieces.  I would rather just play coloretto since its set up and tear down is faster and the game itself plays much quicker.  Not a ton of skill here, so it may as well be fast.

Well it's the same mechanism as Coloretto only dressed up with a bunch of chrome. While I think it works very well in a 15 minute game, I don't think the mechanism is interesting enough, or fair enough for that matter, to make a 45 minute version attractive. The game works, nice bits, I'd just rather do other stuff.

An excellent family-weight/gateway game!  For me, it's right there with Sanssouci: games that I really enjoy playing (even as a gamer) and yet, can play them with anyone.  Doesn't take long at all to play and has a fast-paced playing feel to it.  Turns are easy, but it still gives you some good choices to make.  It all centers around loading those trucks with tiles: when to load, which truck to load, which truck to claim, and when to claim!  Everyone is watching that closely and it generates a good gaming vibe.  Excellent game!

RATING: 7
Zooloretto is a set collection game that's supposed to be an advanced version of Coloretto.  While they do share some mechanics, they are very different games with different feels.  Here, you are collecting animals types to put in your three (or more if you buy them) enclosures, without getting extra animal types that you have to store in your barn.  The enclosures mostly score only if they're full, making the game really dependent on timing--you don't want to fill up an enclosure too soon, as that limits your flexibility.  There are a few other things to manage besides animals, including money to buy both extra enclosures and unwanted animals from other players, and stalls to help out with scoring.

RATING: 4
Acquired along with Polar bear expansion on 3/14/10 from Boards and Bits. [Oct 2013] gave this to my brother, who played quite a bit with his family, and iOS. I have lost my enthusiasm for this game after my initial excitement and introduction to a variety of friends. My basic issue is that it is a little to opaque for newbies, not deep enough for gamers, and mostly because of the runaway leader problem introduced by the expansions. There just doesn't appear to be a any counter for someone who through good fortune grabs the polar bear or other goodies. I don't like it enough to bother trying to identify a way to bring a leader back.

Comment: Decent game that's a more fleshed out version of Coloretto. It's got that weird feel of not quite being a childrens game and not quite being an adult game either. The components are pretty nice for being such a cheap game. Only thing I don't like is the wooden coins since they are pretty superfluous and really don't fit the theme or make sense why they couldn't have just been cardboard and reduce down the price of the game.

Extras: Actually, it's a bit of a reverse; I'm missing the red token that goes on top one of the endgame piles. It never actually came with the game, but it doesn't really make any difference.

Not Recommended with: 3

It's not a total luck-fest, but too close. Bit too simple for my taste. It is not totally bad, but not too good either.

The reason why I don't get rid of this is that my daughter likes to play this (with her own rules) because of all the animals. In general we just draw random animals and place them in our zoo. If there are a male and a female animals of the same species in the same zoo then they get a baby.

28/12-2013: Bought this at a local second hand shop - "Refurn" - for 50 SEK (about 7$) where we have found a couple of games over the last 6 months. Good contition, seemed punched but unplayed. Played this spring 2009, remembered it as an ok Childrens strategy game.

RATING: 6.5
I enjoy this gateway game and it usually has acceptance with most newer players.  It has interaction, some press your luck, and fun feel to manage your zoo.

It's fairly simple and unfortunately, most games seem to have very similar scores as most people are able to get most of their actions in, despite the lack of money.  I pretty much have to play with an expansion or two in the game to add decisions and variability.  If you want something meatier, I'd use Boss expansion or Aquaretto.  If you want a simple game, play Coloretto instead, which is simple and quicker.

I gave this to my little sister for Christmas 2009, and we played a 2 player game together not long afterward. I think it would be more fun with 3+ though. 2 player was okay but not amazing. I've heard the expansions improve it, too, but they are pricey and so was the main game. I wonder if I should have given her Aquaretto instead. Oh well.

RATING: 8
I was considering trading this game, but after playing it a few more times, it is now one of my favorites. The number of available actions on each turn is large, but decision-making is never overwhelming. And there's actually quite a bit of interaction. You indirectly interact by choosing which trucks to place tiles on and by stealing a truck before an opponent has a chance to grab it. Plus there's direct interaction in purchasing animals from each other (although it would be interesting to loosen those rules to allow for a more Settlers-style form of trading/purchasing).

I like the mechanics: either draw, take or arrange your zoo. Interaction of players is quite high because of that drawing system.

Surely children will be happy about this one, animals are beautifully painted and arranging the zoo is nice.
The game feels quite short despite that it's almost an hour. It feels as if there isn't enough time to do everything need to do.

Considering to raise this one from 7 to 8. Need a couple of more plays to be sure!
Edit: After Aquaretto.. this one stays at 7.

The theme is fun and the game play is pretty simple. Scoring is not transparent, by which I mean that looking doesn't give you an immediate sense of who's ahead. This can make strategy somewhat obscure. I ended up trading it away, because I found that I never wanted to play it.

RATING: 4
(1 play)  We only played one 2-player game, so maybe not a fair determination.  On the other hand, the game was tested, and it failed the test.  

The decisions to move the animals around felt more like irritations than fun.  There was nothing to think about during your opponent's turn, and that made it boring - which is especially bad because the turns are so short.  We imagined waiting for 3 or 4 other people to complete their turns, and couldn't imagine enjoying the game.

For my part, I liked the turn options of being able to coin-stall from turn to turn to get the best choice of animals, and it definitely works - but Sarah really dislikes those kind of mechanisms.  I don't dislike those moves... but that is really all there is to this game - and that's not really fun.

RATING: 6
An average family game that will appeal to women as well as men. Unfortunately, the game just comes down to putting tiles on "trucks" in the center as strategically as possible. Far too light for what it offers and it has a wonky euro-scoring system tacked on that makes it more complicated than it needs to be. I don't know how this won the Spiel des Jahres.

RATING: 7
$20 - $0 Unplayed value Deadwood + $20 for this game. (Local Trade)

This is a great little fun game. Within it's own weight it outclass a lot of other gateway family game that I have. I just get so much joy and fun out of this little game. I actually like this game better than Coloretto contrary to popular opinion. In Coloretto the game is more dry and cut throat. The game forces you to play nasty versus your opponents. Meanwhile, in Zooloretto, you have moments that you are just trying to reach mutual benefits (at least in my 2-player games). I have yet to try a 3+ player game but I look forward to it.

---- Update ----
With more excellent game coming out for 2-players the urge to play this game is lowered. Rating dropped from 8 to 7.

RATING: 7
Cute revision of the card game Coloretto.  Doesn't take too long, and has a few other tweaks, and a more appealing theme (which is part of why I give it a 7 instead of a 6).  The usefulness of money and the sparing amount of it that's available makes one a frequently more passive player than is fitting for a game like this.  In sum, the selection mechanism taken from Coloretto fits better with a game of less investment (like Coloretto), but is much more frustrating in a more dynamic game of scoring like this.  Still, it's enjoyable.

I wasn't sure that this game would offer enough more than Coloretto to justify the longer play time. After a few plays I really do like the extras brought to the game. Even though the rules are slightly more complex, the concrete goal of collecting animals has made Zooloretto easier for my (then) 5 and 3 year old kids to learn than Coloretto. A good family game. [The expansions allow you to add a nice little twist for variety now and then.]

RATING: 6
Great little game.  I'm a sucker for zoo themes, even if they are accused of being "pasted on".  The Coloretto aspect is very well maintained, while the introduction of money gives players a difficult set of new choices to make.  While the special powers money give are great, it's hard to make money, so there is a crux of what to do with your money.  A great way to add some more skill to a game that's mostly chance, on top of a very well produced set of bits!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This is effectively a big-box version of Coloretto, but with much nicer bits, different scoring, and a few extra available actions on your turn.

WARNING: Not as much fun with only 2 players, although it is much more interesting than playing Coloretto with the 2 player variant - especially with the designer's suggested alterations to the 2 player rules (only remove 2 animal types, all 5 extra enclosures available to both players).

For me this improves the cardgame in terms of being kinder, being cute and having a theme (especially the fun "offspring" situations). It adds an interesting monetary layer, but with more than 3 players the downtime is exaggerated, the only plus the card game has over this upgrade. But the real let down is the unwieldy scoring conditions which almost prompts the need for pen and paper to tally the score.

Your board has room for only a certain number of a certain number of types of animals, before you start taking negative points. There's more to it than that but not much. It's simple and full of tension.

I will say that the process of removing animal types for fewer than 5 players is tiresome.

Somewhat dull, but cool theme and very high production value.  In fairness, I've only gotten to play it two player, and I think that probably kills some of the potentially fun interaction.  That said, I'm not bummed that I own it, but I don't see it getting brought out too much.  Maybe the expansions will help...

I would most likely rate this higher if Coloretto did not exist. But it does, and I find it superior in all respects except the cute-factor of the animals. Coloretto has just as many tough decisions, an easier-to-read board state, a shorter play-time and fewer distractions from the game's excellent core mechanic. My wife likes the babies though, so I guess this is a keeper :)

Good set collection. Simple, family friendly. And it plays fast!

P.S.: there's this argument that Coloretto is better because it's quicker and simpler, but Zooloretto adds theme into it so it has more appeal to non-gamers and family. Thus, I own both and I like to play both!

Coloretto - with tiles and a board. Having played both I can see where the tile drafting mechanism came from, also the scoring mechanism. 
There is enough other things happening to provide playing and theme separation from the earlier card game.
I liked how your actions must occur while your tiles are available for other players. That is the last action you take for a round is to seize the tiles you want and play on the board. 
This is a good gateway game to get people more interested - it has decent player interaction without being too vicious.

This is a good family game, but oftentimes dealing with the draws and trying to create decent trucks is nearly impossible. Also there never seems to be enough tightness to the game, as it seems most players are able to fill their zoo by the end of every game regardless of their moves made prior--mostly it just comes to who has the fewest extra animal types left in their barn.

A tartozékok kinyomkodása után elsőnek az a kérdés jött elő, hogy ez vajon miért volt az év játéka?

A szabályok átolvasása után volt egy kis káosz. (Ez év játéka lett volna?)
A próbajáték előtt elég sok időt vett igénybe az előkészület, amihez aránytalanul rövid lett a játék. Persze, ha több parti megy le egymás után, akkor nem annyira gáz, de egy játék miatt nem érdemes elővenni.

A próbajáték után már látszott, hogy ez egyszerű játék. Egy hatévessel már bátran játszható, még akkor is, ha nem nagyon ügyes a taktikázásban.

Ez az év játéka volt? Vagy Ezt már kérdeztem?

RATING: 7
Solid Agricola-Super Light with each player caring and growing its own Zoo on a seperate board. The interaction comes with choosing which animals (truck) to take, just like in Coloretto and buying animals from other players' barns, even though this does not happen enough and should be cheaper in my opinion, in order to promote player interaction a tad more. Still, cute theme and artwork. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.25
This is a fun game.  Their are many strategies you can employ with regard to gathering your animals.  Each section of your zoo can only have one specific animal.  You get points for filling the enclosures.  Add stands to enclosures you can not fill.  Animals in the barn are negative points.  You definitely want to expand your zoo.  Happy gathering.

Ugghhh! Be weary of players who accidentally set others up for the win. Sorry, this is what happened in my last game and it was hard to take. I guess I shouldn't be getting mad at my 6 yr old but damn!!!

Besides that specific game, we have enjoyed playing this fast, light, family game. Not a lot of tough or impactful decisions but it is def a good game for adults to play with children that is better than almost anything at Toys R Us. Not sure how much longer I'll keep it because I see some good replacements coming up but it's here for a little longer at least.

Revised from 8 to 7. Now a 7.5. It seemed that the added layer of money actually hindered the game when compared to the streamlined elegance of Coloretto. There didn't seem enough ways to collect money to make it worth the extra rules weight. The bag pass is too slow and fumbly for these mechanics. Not enough variability in score.
I'm thinking that expansions may be almost required after the 1st play for this game - I'll look again into which ones I can print and play the easiest.

I've only played this one as a two player game.  The dynamic might change with more people but only time will tell. This is definitely lighter than I usually like to go with a board game. I can see the evolution from Coloretto but to be honest I prefer the original. It's possible that I'd enjoy the game more if it had a theme that appealed to me. I'll stick with Coloretto to fill this gap.  I will however hang on to this because I think it would be a good game to play with Children.

RATING: 7.25
I am slightly torn on this game.  I enjoy the base mechanic of collecting the sets of animals and the artwork is pleasant.  I think it would work well as a "gateway" game due to the accessible theme and relatively short playtime.  Those factors also make it a great game to play with your children.

However - I honestly like the simplicity of Coloretto (its sibling game) a bit better.  Coloretto is a card game making it more portable, compact, and much cheaper to obtain.  Sure, there is a little more added into Zooloretto than Coloretto - It has fun little animal tokens and cart tokens (this is a hit with my kids).  Also, the game doesn't try to hide the fact it is similar (it does have "-oretto" in its title after all).  I'm not sure the added features make it a better game, though.

A fun game, but if you are on a budget, pick up Coloretto instead.

RATING: 7.03
Gave to my 11 year old daughter for Christmas 2012.

Fun game, but a little simplistic....while still being cut throat.  You need to make decisions that are neutral for you, but hurt the other players.

We really got into it for about 3 weeks.  But since we played Coloretto, we haven't gone back to it much.

Rules about how to move animals around the zoo are a little fiddly.

I initially wasn't too excited to try this out - thinking it's just a longer board based Coloretto.  Now that I have, however, I'm glad I did.  I feel like the planning of what can be done is fun and adds to my enjoyment of the game.  Plus for some reason, it's easier for me to assess the animal/color situation in the board game than in the card.  Anyway, fun game.

(When rating games I focus on the "how likely I am to play this game again" part of the BGG description rating, as opposed to the "quality" part of the rating.)

I like building up my zoo.  There's the push-your-luck element of waiting to take a truck but risk getting animal types you can't place in your enclosures, and the limited resources in the lack of money to expand or rearrange your zoo.  There's luck and strategy and interaction in trying to second-guess others or try to make another player take a truck you don't want.  Good theme and mechanics, lovely components.

Lindo, se Coloretto já era um jogo fantástico, este up-grade é um globetrotter...

Bonito para as crianças, mas não é, de todo, um jogo infantil, quer seja com ou sem expansões. Fenomenal!

RATING: 6
Played once at my gaming group, but rating gets a kick up because my 9 yo daughter could join in the game with us and do well enough to tie for first (but lose on the tie-break).  So what does that mean for this game?  

Attractive theme that invites folks into a game and with simple enough rules to make it easy to explain.  A bit of decision space in each turn to add a modest challenge...resulting in a nice, nice family game.  I can see why this was awarded the SdJ in 2007.

About the only demerit I have on the game is that scores tend to be very clustered at game's end.  Fill the three pens for a base 23 pionts with stalls and barns adjusting the score slightly from there.  (NB - 2P variant is actually quite interesting and works well  with its removal of tiles from the game helping to make it more difficult to fill the pens)

Is there enough control over the game to result in a satisfying result if played ad nauseum?  I don't suspect so, but then again, this is a game to be dipped into for family fun on occasion.  For that purpose - worth having in the collection.

Solid family game. You affect the game with your every action. Very good 2-player game, easily played in 15 minutes with no stress. Very nice-looking board and pieces. Definitely not Coloretto, much more than it, but uses the great base mechanic from it. Played about 20 times. Highly recommended.

Each player in Zooloretto starts with a player board that features four empty zoo enclosures. All you have to do is fill them up with animals. Sounds easy, huh? Think again. Players take turns filling trucks up with animals which is the tricky dynamic part of this game. Seems easy until you get to the halfway point of the game and your opponents have stocked up the trucks with animals you don't have a place for. And just wait until your animals have babies! Better have a plan for that, too. Cute little animal components make this a game I would recommend to most players.

--Jan2008-- One play with Daughter #1 (age 8.)  She was distracted by the sub-game of "ending with the most baby animals."  But other than that, we both enjoyed ourselves.  As to the game, the mechanics are very close to those of Coloretto, but the presentation is really nice.  Is it worth the premium?  Not at all sure:  but if the youngster and I play it a dozen times over the next year, easily so.

RATING: 7
A fine game with a broad appeal.  The bits are very attractive, though the 'trucks' look nothing like trucks.  With more options than in Coloretto and good interaction among players, it's easy to see why this was nominated for Spiel des Jarres.  I don't think it's the stongest of the nominees, but its a fun game, that might appeal as a gateway game.

Egy igazán könnyed családi játék, amellyel én magam a társasjátékos életem viszonylag késői szakaszában találkoztam, ezért úgy gondolom, hogy nem tudom igazán nagyra értékelni.
Ajánlatos a játékok világának megismerésében járatlanok számára, ők lehetnek az igazi célközönség. Illetve talán még a kisgyermekes családok, ahol a felnőttek közösen tudnak játszani a picikkel.
Klasszikus bevezető játéknak érzem, amely rém egyszerű mechanikával dolgozik (én kicsi áthallást érzek az Alhambra irányába - legalábbis ami az istállóból  ketrecbe cserét illeti).
A grafikája még az, ami igazán megfoghatja a családokat. Ez az a játék, amit a nagyszülőknek érdemes beszereznie az unoka számára :)

Eddig tartott...Meggyőztem magam, hogy nem fér el a polcon, ezért túladtam rajta. Túlságosan könnyűnek találtatott (plusz ehhez jött egy aránytalanul nagy set-up idő is). Jobb lesz ez így.

We don't play this a lot, and so I am always happy to play it. Good length. Lots of little "take thats", but not in a way that is going to make you mad, or hurt anyone's feelings. Same game as Coloretto really, but the theme is much more fun, and works great for kids. And dads. BUT. If you are in the mood for something quick, Coloretto is better yet.

Kids seem to like it, but there's nothing of interest for adults here.  Coloretto is better, and cheaper, and is the distilled essence of Zooloretto and a much better play for it.

Zooloretto is very pretty though.  Credit where credit is due, were it not for the cheesy wood money this might be the single sweetest packages available on the market.

Coloretto is a fine filler and Zooloretto is the board game cousin. The game play works very much like Coloretto with tiles instead of cards. You have a limited number of pens for different animals and you are trying to file them with the same kind of animals. There are a couple of new things like babies, kiosks and the possibility to get rid of unwanted tiles or buy tiles from somebody else. I think that Coloretto works well so I don't really have the need for the board game. 27-06-07 Played this again last night and it's hard to believe this won SdJ. IMHO it has nothing going for it or we have been playing it in a wrong (I also suck bad in this game :-).

:thumbsup: Good with any number of players.

Takes the central good idea of Coloretto and makes an actual game around it. There are some problems though. Some of the systems are convoluted for such a simple game.

Really does not add much to the base game of Coloretto. For what it is, it's far too expensive for a slight "upgrade" to Coloretto and I do not even think the changes (money actions, stalls) add all that much.

I love the way you've gotta try and screw everyone else more than you yourself are getting screwed, it's tense, a dose of luck for fun and it's hilarious watching others cop a really nasty lot and that's what makes this a winner in my book.

Re the expansions I usually play with the extra enclosures, the petting zoo, the buildings and the polar bear expansion.  Just chuck em all in!  The building sites expansion doesn't work for me though.

I like the game, but I don't like some of the rules. I would like to try a couple variants...

1. Move/Exchange variant: Exchanging includes moving all animals of 1 type to an open area, and costs $2

2. After taking a truck and placing the animals, you immediately get a Money action. This is really important on the last turn of the game, but might be nice earlier as well. Perhaps just apply this rule at the game end.

I'm amazed that I have made it 20 games into this before leaving a comment.  Most of the reason for this many plays of this game is that my younger daughter has a liking for this game, more likely due to a combination of a green box with a panda displayed prominently than to any particular affinity for the actual game play.  That said, one of them does on occasion manage to win games we play.  

Overall, this a game find to be a pleasant distraction, though I much prefer the simpler Coloretto than this.  The extra stuff that is going on in this game does not really add any significant fun factor.  That said, I won't avoid playing with it either and have even picked up RGG's version of the first batch of expansions.  We particularly like the petting zoo around here.  For those interested, I don't much care for Aquaretto, though I may someday pick up a copy.  [01/08/2011]

Zooloretto -- Played once; five player.

I did not care for Zooloretto when I played it years ago. For some ineffable reason, I liked my recent play of Aquaretto much more.

Actually, I think it was due at least partially to the reduced number of players. I played Zooloretto with more players, and it seemed that the selections available when my turn rolled around were too haphazard (or intentionally bad).

Happy, accessible game that pleases a wide range of people. Powered by the simple, yet elegant, Coloretto mechanism, Zooloretto remains a sweet, short game. Though the small add-ons are not earth-shaking, they do add a bit of color to the set-up as you decide which ones to use and they keep things fresh. Happiness.

[8 plays] If you know Coloretto, you get what you expect here, and it is good. Coloretto has been expanded from a card game with a neat mechanic to a fleshed out boardgame version that retains the tough selection decisions, but incorporates other fun decisions. It does this quite well, without bogging down the speed or fun of the game.

I recommend this highly. I'd rate it 10 for kids and families and 8 for all other gamers. The artwork is charming.

RATING: 8
My family really likes this, especially with 5 players.  Trying to jockey for the best trucks while not leaving too much juicy stuff for others is quite a challenge, and we always come away feeling "dang, if I'd have just done this or that..."  A hit when we go to my parents house for dinner to play with my siblings and dad.

This game is a tile drawing game that, as the name implies, uses some of the same mechanics as the game Coloretto.  It should be noted that most games with monkeys are cool, meaning that this game and the Geekway favorite Monkey Madness both tempt players to chant, "Come on monkeys!" before a draw, making it possibly a good game to play with children -- or while drunk.  Worse of all, unlike Coloretto, this game doesn't come with the evil castle card to keep track of player order.  Without the evil castle card, players will just be aimlessly flailing around -- with or without their monkeys...

Not a fault of the game itself, but the iOS version doesn't let me spend coins on anything other than the pen expansion. Haven't managed to win yet despite playing quite a few games. Nice idea with the set collecting.

Rating is for iOS - I'd imagine the real game is better.

RATING: 7
I actually prefer Coloretto the simple card game over the more involved Zooloretto the board game, but the theme and cutesy animals are a good way to draw in non-gamers and that is always a plus in my book. I have mixed in the animals from "Zooloretto Junior". As the size is compatbile, that adds a lot of variety to keep things fresh.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
As usual, as soon as I've written off Michael Schacht games he comes along and makes something fun.  I did not enjoy Coloretto at all.  I found that the game devolves too easily into littering all prospects with worthless crap and the winner is the player that doesn't get crapped on as much as all the other players.  Here there is more control and fewer variables.  This is more or less the same game, but it is a bit more refined, with more intriguing decisions, while still remaining fluffy and nontaxing.  I see why this got the SdJ.

I'd like to make a sausage house where you can ship all the bodies that you paid to get rid of.  

F.Y.I. the babies are adorable.

This game had been replaced by animale on board. Both have the same feeling of trying to get a certain amount of animals, but zooloretto feels really clunky when compared. The little rules that are there, so players don't break the game, feel just like that and don't add the playing pleasure.

Coloretto is a little more direct, but adding this theme does open up the possibility to do some really interesting things.  The base game winds up being over priced -- again, Coloretto was better off with just cards -- but when we do go ahead and add some expansions .... niiiiice
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The game's theme barely hangs in there - why do you get coins for filling certain pens but not others, why don't you get coins if an exchange fills the pen, why would an animal truck show up to your zoo with a zebra, an apple stand, and one giant coin - but it's fun to develop your zoo. It's funny that there is not much more to this game than Coloretto, but I'm much worse at it and I enjoy it more. Very family friendly (I've played with a 6 1/2 year old who beat me and came in 2nd) so I can see why it won the SdJ.

Uh-oh!  After 9 plays it's waning a bit for me.  Still a solid 8 on the scale, and I still enjoy it, but it just seems a little repetitious at times.  I never expect it to leave the collection, though.  It's a wonderful-looking game with a lot of appeal to families.  UPDATE: I played once with two of the expansions and that helped liven it up a bit, so that's good news.

A collection and management game.  A couple of key interesting decisions are the focus of the game: do I take a truck and where do I place the tile I've drawn?  Not terribly deep, but certainly fun.

The kids like this one, maybe a bit more than I do, though the way they play it, makes it fun to play with them. Desires for baby animals override any other strategic decisions for them. So be it.

It's kind of a board game version of Coloretto, but with more going on. Each player has their own board with 3 enclosures of sizes 4, 5 and 6; 4 spaces for market stalls; and a barn. Start with 2 coins. There are 5 wooden platforms with space for 3 tiles, and a bunch of face down tiles. Players start with 1 tile each, of a different animal. Tiles are animals of various types (11 each), with 2 male and 2 female versions each; or market stalls; or coins. On your turn, you either draw a tile and add it to a platform; spend money to do something (1 to trade species from one of your areas to another; 2 to kill an animal in your barn; 2 to buy an animal from another player's barn, 1 of which goes to that player; 3 to buy a new enclosure of size 5, with another market stall space); or take the wooden platform. If you take the platform, you put the animals and stalls in their areas (enclosures can only hold 1 species of animal); you are OUT of the rest of the round. If you finish an enclosure, you may get bonus coin(s). The game ends when you start drawing from the last bunch of tiles (set aside at the beginning). At the end, you score points for each area that is full or has 1 empty spot (if >1 empty, only get points if a market stall is adjacent) and for the # of different types of stalls. You lose 2 points for every animal still in your barn. Most points wins!

I had played Coloretto once or twice, but really didn't like it; it's probably been a few years since my last game. But I think Zooloretto is VERY well done! It has push-your-luck and set-collection elements similar to Ra, but also adds some other interesting stuff like space (area) management and a bit of an economy. And it does it all in less than an hour! I generally prefer the longer, heavier games. However, this seems to be an excellent game of this genre. In fact, it makes me want to go back and try Coloretto again! Of course, I've only played the game once so this may change, but I doubt it'll change by a lot!

 I actually prefer Coloretto.  It plays and sets up much more quickly and has much more tension.  It's as if they added game time and more rules and reduced the tension.  My kids and wife kind of like it, but I find the rules and gameplay more clunky than its predecessor.  Also, all the extra pieces and boards look nice, but they also add significantly to the price.  Not bad, but I'll stick with the original.

What a joy to see how much pleasure this bought to them, as good as TTR for "geting them hooked" game. 3rd game with 3 non-gaming friends, they loved it, despite a lot of negative tile placing and selection. Might be better with 4 rather than 5.

Gifted game.  christmas gift i think, designed for family play with the kids.  and although i do believe it was designed for younger gamers, adults can still have fun and make some meaningful decisions.  money tends to be scarce and you feel somewhat limited in certain actions.  but the fun is loading up the carts and seeing how your opponents react to it.  i'm glad its in the collection but to be honest, its not one i probably would have looked at for purchase.

Meh. Only two plays, and I'm already starting to get bored by this game. For me, there was absolutely no need to provide Coloretto with all kinds of bells and whistles. Also, has some really annoying minor rules (like having to pick the top animal from your reserve stack to remove, rather than being able to choose one).
It's not really bad, but I would just rather not play this again.

Meh. It was cute, but didn't pull me in. To draw parallels from movies, some children's films (like "Shrek") are interested in entertaining both adults and children, and others (like...

I could see how a non-gamer who has a thing for animals might enjoy this game.  I can also see why my wife, who appreciates drawing tiles and building things, enjoys this game.  I cannot see how I could ever enjoy this fairly random and surprisingly nasty game.  There aren't very many meaningful decisions to be made, and you're almost as concerned about inhibiting other players' progress as you are about focusing on your own progress.  And the playing tiles don't even look like a zoo!  Needless to say (but I'll say it anyways), this isn't my cup of tea.  If I have to play a game like this, I'll take "Aquaretto" instead.

Ciascun giocatore è il proprietario di uno zoo. I giocatori ottengono punti attirando il maggior numero possibile di visitatori. Per raggiungere questo obiettivo, i giocatori devono ottenere gruppi di animali dello stesso tipo.

Se un giocatore riesce a ottenere molti animali per il proprio zoo, può considerare anche la possibilità di espandersi. Quando i recinti sono pieni, gli animali devono andare nella stalla ed i giocatori perdono punti. Le piccole bancarelle che si trovano vicino ai recinti garantiscono un numero minimo di visitatori. Il giocatore con il maggior numero di punti vince la partita.

I liked Coloretto and I really wanted to like this.  Unfortunately, it's just too random and chaotic for me.  While it retains all of the elements of Coloretto that I like, the added complexity and the added playing time hurt the game.  It's a fine family game with wonderful production values and I can see why the Spiel des Jahres committee picked it but it just didn't quite do it for me.  It's pretty good but I was hoping for something a little better.

I was surprised because I find Michael Schacht's games a little too fiddly. This one has some fiddly rules too, you have to remember you can switch out, mate the animals and score the enclosure, for example. But there are some very interesting mechanics of both bidding and trying to fill your stalls.

Ooh, this is actually pretty good.

It really is just Coloretto with a few added rules but Coloretto's pretty good, so this is pretty good too.

It, like Carcassonne, is one of those games that newbies can play together and play nicely and it is a good game. Or, a bunch of gamers can play together and it become vicious and mean (and much lower scoring) and still be a good game.

I wouldn't mix the two though...

light family game for playing with children ?
too simple ?
really nice zoo and animal theme, but a bit too childish

Everybody likes collecting animals and having your own zoo!

It's odd that the wagons and the coins are made of wood. Here, as an exception, it would have actually sufficed to use the same cardboard as for the other tiles. The wagons would probably look better as cardboard pieces with nice artwork (like in "Zooloretto Junior").

Box is oversized

Played this for the first time at Gamers@Dockers and didn't feel particularly blown away by it. Preferred Coloretto instead. Recently played this with Andrew and this time, it felt a lot better. There's actually more going on here than in Coloretto - with fixed enclosure sizes, animals that you were once collecting will eventually become animals you don't want to collect because you've got too many of them. This raises an interesting "over-feeding" strategy that you don't get in Coloretto - if your opponent has too many Elephants and no where else to put more, you can over-feed his trucks with Elephants to incur negative points in the end!

Nicely put together game - really just a fancy version of Coloretto with different (yet similar) scoring. This probably plays faster than Coloretto and is easier to score. I think 4 is the sweet spot if playing just Zooloretto without expansions or Aquaretto.

**UPDATE: There are a bazillion expansions (not counting Aquaretto, which stands by itself, but is fun with Zooloretto). Most of the expansions aren't groundbreaking or special, but they do offer some more options to make things more interesting. However, at some point, it feels like a money grab from the publisher rather than adding to the game. When you come back to the game, you are trying to piece together the 1500 little rules and parts.

I was never super enthralled with Coloretto, and I'm not with this SDJ winner either.  It seems that Coloretto, at least, is of about the correct complexity (simple!).

My wife works at a veterinary clinic and loves animals, so I've been wanting to give this one a try because of the theme. The game play was a little bland, as I expected, and the theme felt pasted on. You can definitely tell that they made Coloretto first and said "hey, let's make a zoo game out of this!" I don't really need to play again, but I could see playing this with my kids some day.

For such a simple game, this one really grabbed me. It's like a "Ra-lite" in its mechanics, with the added bonus of having a theme which is almost guaranteed to interest kids. Oddly, when I later played this game's ancestor Coloretto, it failed to grab my interest in the least. Does that show that I'm shallow and easily swayed by even the flimsiest of themes, or are the few little additions to the mechanics in Zooloretto enough to raise it above its earlier incarnation? Either way, it's interesting to note that Coloretto scores above Zooloretto on the 'Geek.

A straightforward tile-laying game, this attempts to be a family game but IMO is a bit too complex for that, at least if playing with younger kids. A bit surprisingly - based on too games - it seems to be quite random too, with very equal final scores, which seem to be settled by one or two key decisions during the last few rounds of the game.

Yes, this is "just" Coloretto the boardgame, but it's not simply an overproduced card game. Placement and management in the zoo areas, the addition of money and money actions and other additions make the conversion of the simple Coloretto mechanics into a larger production very worthwhile and equate to a fun game that takes on a character of its own. The theme is terrific, the bits are pretty good and the game is very approachable for families and gaming novices while giving more experienced gamers plenty to think about. A clear winner in my book.

Played twice, once with 4 and once with 5players. While fairly simple to play, there is a little room for strategy and clever play. If newbies will be playing, please make sure you print out the player aids as they are extremely helpful to remind the players of their several options and how scoring is done. Might take a little too long for the level of complexity, but maybe that will improve over time.

The selection of barges filled with animal tiles is truly charming and it's the best mechanism of Zooloretto.  But the darn thing just doesn't crackle.  This is a soothing title that is good for family play.  Given that context, the final scoring is a bit complex.

A stellar gateway game with a family-friendly theme and as much face-to-face competition as your gaming group wants to add, as the race for zoo trucks can get quite fierce with experienced gamers. The game's simplicity works for younger gamers (they might not be as competitive as older ones, but they'll still have fun). Plenty of small expansions to keep this one fresh. Tip -- with new Zooloretto players, print out a cheat-sheet on the few different ways to spend money, as that's the most easily forgotten part of the game.

  "But I don't have any money.  Can't I just ******* trade it with you?"

My daughter enjoyed our play (and did very well on points, but it wasn't really by design) but we both enjoyed Aquaretto more. 

I think both games are missing something to break the mechanical and motononous pacing. I think something additional could be done with the markets related to currency production which might freshen up the game.

By itself, the game is a bit of a drag. Setup is slow because of piece adjustments for variable players. Also, it can be hard to keep the attention of young people while setting up and explaining the game.

Well I finally got to play this SDJ game and I can see why it's what it is. A great game by a great designer. A lot of California feel but more in depth and thought out. Makes for a longer game as well so if you want faster go for California. Good game though and theme is immersive.

UPDATE: added XXL, and the two Rio Grand expansion packs to the game it's better than ever...increasing rating as a result. 

Play feels every bit as good with 2 players, a plus in my house.

The board and money actions leaven the too-strong "screw your neighbor" aspect of Coloretto, and add a variety of tactical options. Some of these are immediately apparent, while some are likely take at least a few plays to reveal.

While I also like Coloretto, I think it a sad kind of nonsense that this game is the lower ranked of the two. But it seems like time may be correcting that.

Only 2 plays so far, both with 3 players. Seems nice enough but it was extremely easy to fill the enclosures, even with removing all the tiles for 2 of the animals. This makes the game solely about the vending stalls and the relatively simple task of avoiding animals you don't want. 

I would prefer the focus to be more on collecting what you do want, instead of avoiding what you don't, but with it  being so easy to fill your enclosures, it doesn't feel that way. Perhaps this is a problem with the 3-player game. I look forward to trying it with 5 players.

Each player uses small, large, wild, and exotic animals and their young to try to attract as many visitors as possible to their zoo. But be careful - the zoo must be carefully planned. Before you know it, you have too many animals and no more room for them. That brings minus points! Luckily, your zoo can expand. A zoo of a family game in which less is sometimes more...

I definitely like this better than Coloretto, as there's considerably more to think about. It's still a fairly light game, but has enough meat on it to interest me. Since it should be played at reasonable speed, it could use a reference card detailing the coin options and the scoring system (not all of which is on the boards).

Entertaining family game, which was unfortunately overshadowed by its successor Aquaretto. Where Zooloretto really feels like a boardgame incarnation of Coloretto, Aquaretto adds a bit more decisionmaking. I also prefer the water theme of Aquaretto, but that's of course a matter of taste.

A light game and certainly would play it if it weren't too chaotic. The game has a similar feel to Coloretto, but I just simply prefer the card game. This game expands the concept but it makes things just more complicated with making the game any better. The theme does help though. People enjoy the idea of building a zoo and housing animals. However, the tension of the tile draw is somewhat lessen with the money action and also the absence of the non-linear negative point accumulation. 

On the fence with this one. Will keep it around because it is simple and easy to play with other folks as a gateway game.

Adorable light family game with some good decisions and some screwage. I don't quite get why you have to pay to have the animals in your barn turned into meat. They should pay you for that.

Still warming up to this game.  We don't like the 2-player version at all.  However, just with one more player this game shows why it's a great family game.  Similar to Bohnanaza, this a lot of fun with children and provides enough stimulation for adults to actually want to play games with their kids.  With this in mind, I see this being played more and more in the future.  Looking forward to updating these comments after more playes of Zooloretto, especially with when more players are involved (4-5).

I like the discription of this game as mostly harmless.  There's not a lot to this light tile laying game.  But it is fun and most importantly quick.  Basically the game is about filling your pens with one type of animal.  If all your pens are occupied, new species go in the barn.  Barn is bad, pen is good. :)  Tiles are drawn from a bag and placed in "trucks".  When a truck is to your liking you take it instead of drawing a tile.  Game ends the round you empty the tile bag.

(After 1 3p game)  A game set in modern times with a job (zookeeper) that is known across the globe - a good thing in my opinion.   The rules were short, easy to understand and gameplay offered enough of a challenge to scratch the gamer itch, but also see the thinking of the SDJ committee and how it won.  Might become a gateway game.  I have never played Coloretto so I can't compare the two.

Rated after 9 games. The idea is nice, the board is pretty and so on, but this is perhaps a little bit too much a family game for my taste. More or less everything seems to end up nicely every time, every one gets a nice little zoo. But with 5 players the game is a little bit better, there are not so many coins or hot dog stands and it is harder to get the perfect zoo.

My husband & I have game buying rules.  I can spend as much on games as he spends on his bicycle gear. Except when he spends too much. Also I can buy any Spiel des Jahres or Reiner Knizia game whenever I want.  Also I have to have played more then 50% of the games I have before I can get more, which I do about 3 times a year [birthday, anniversary & xmas] or more. Heck buying games is almost it's own game for us. But I'm very happy Zooloretto won the Spiel des Jahres, so it qualified as a game I could get.

Some people are saying, "It's like Michael Schacht took the mechanism from Coloretto and made a real game with them!", but I'm saying, "It's like Michael Schacht took Coloretto and made it unnecessarily complicated."  I suppose if you thought that Ticket to Ride: Marklin was an improvement on the simple elegance of Ticket to Ride, then you'll likely have a better impression of Zooloretto than you did of Coloretto.  FOr me, the game isn't bad, but I would much rather play the game in its simplified -- in my mind, purer -- form.

Simple game that I like a lot. It's not always easy to decide which truck you gonna take or if you will wait for a better truck. The game is better with more players, because there are more animals that a player can't place in his zoo.

RATING: 6
Zooloretto is well on the lighter side of the complexity scale. As I read through the rulebook the first time, I wasn't even sure if there was much of a game to be found here. Indeed, the first few turns of my first play through weren't much more interesting. It isn't until those first couple of exhibits fill up that the game starts making sense. Once you can start force-feeding your opponents critters that don't want and start manipulating your zoo to make money the game becomes much more interesting.

I still am not sure if there is enough strategy to keep the game group interested, but Zooloretto works very well in the family sense. It also reminds me a little of Carcassonne, in that you can play it in a non-confrontational manner or you can take a more competitive track and actively try to hurt your opponents. That flexibility will probably keep it on my shelf, even if the gamers in the group aren't all completely sold on it.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A great expansion of the elegant concepts of Coloretto into a full-fledged board game. This does an excellent job of taking the fun of Coloretto and making it more strategic without bogging it down with overly complicated concepts. There's not a whole lot here that I disliked; it's a really fun way to spend an hour or so.

Plays quite fast.  After the 1st couple of rounds, there always seems to be tough decisions whether to hold out a little longer or to grab something on one of the trucks while it helps or at least doesn't hinder.  Of course there is also the temptation to try and get enough of animal types to fill your enclosures.

RATING: 5
Nice components, despite lacking a bag (and duh, who wants to manually stack/shuffle 112 tiles?), but still felt expensive.  It's a PITA sorting tiles with < 5, and the money action options are more obtuse than interesting.

Great theme for kids, but a bit too confusing for them, while just not terribly interesting for adults. Yet I think this one will stick around at my house for a long time, just based on the cutesiness.

For the size of the box and the amount of components, the gameplay is very shallow. It is a nice family game for playing with younger kids but all in all it feels bloated (in terms of production value). I have not tried out the dice game version but I think that this could create a similar gaming experience in a much smaller package. As it is, I am totally fine with playing it on my iPod.
And besides: the expansion concept stinks. They should have designed the game so that you can really expand your options with the expansions instead of allowing you just one at a time.

It's fun, it's got animals...money is rather scarce though and there's not that much to buy.  Plus all the zoos are samey.  You've all got the same size pens and the same layout...No way to make "your own zoo".  

Different animal types is definitely a step up from the chameleons though.

I played this game for the first time at DTC 2015.  I played with my wife, and she liked it (good sign.)  We eventually bought this game and have played it with both gamers and non-gamers with great success.  It is euro and the player interaction is mostly indirect, but important.  Although, there is an option to murder your animals.  I mean, they don't call it the "murder action" or anything, but... come on... it is animal murder.

As I do like this game, I almost want to rate it 7.5 but honestly, I find it more frustrating than I had anticipated. I like to fill a stall before opening a new one to collect a greater variety of animals, so my "strategy" is rather bad. I also don't like how you sabotage other players- it's not the friendliest game, and I tend to like games that are more independently oriented and less involved with others. But it is fun- a great theme and easy to play. I do quite like it and enjoy playing, it's just not ideal in terms of certain elements jiving with my personality... that's all. (It definitely would be a favorite if there wasn't such epic panda stealing, etc. involved)

RATING: 7
Overall an interesting game, which quite a different theme.  I like the idea of planning what sets to collect, and optimizing them, but it can be quite tough depending on what tiles come out of the bag.  All and all a pretty solid title.

This one's a big "meh". The theme is fun and appeals to casual gamers, including children, but the rules are a bit too complex to easily explain, not to mention the scoring. It also shares a bit of the "group resources in sets that both you and your opponents will get to take" mechanic seen in San Marco, which I love on paper but just can't seem to grasp in practice.

Really enjoyed this so far. Using the designer's suggested 2 player variant works really well. Also fun at higher player counts. Counting up the points at the end can take a bit of time, but not too bad. And I like that the game is simple enough for my older daughter to play. Purchased a custom drawstring bag for the tiles.

When I purchased this my daughter (8) was so excited to play it, since she loves Coloretto and cute zoo animals are always a plus.  Unfortunately, it didn't meet her expectations and I can't get a definite reason out of her.  She says, "It just wasn't fun."  My husband says, "Meh. Take it or leave it."

I liked it, maybe I'll try to get them to play one more time before finding it a new home, but I can't see this beating out Coloretto.  I can definitely see where it is a great game for young kids and families overall, but it just isn't for us.

I'm actually surprised I bought this. I merely thought it ok, and in a way, preferred the rather quicker coloretto. I guess I figured I'll add it as a possible future family game to pull out 5 years from now.

As friends have said: "This makes Coloretto into a real game!"

Due to its subject matter and relative ease of play, Zooloretto is a family classic.  Not bad for adults, either, since it isn't all empty calories.  After all, there are frequent opportunities for space management, pressing your luck, and the barbaric sabotage of your opponents' truck selections.

RATING: 7.5
Played twice (with 3 and 4 players). At first I thought it was nothing more than a board game version of Coloretto with cute animals, but there might be something more in it. Timing issues are probably more important than in the card game, and some more player interaction is added by allowing the players to buy animals from their concurrent zoos. However, it won't fully replace Coloretto for me (if only because of the portability problem).

Like Coloretto but with cutesy pieces. Adds a little bit more to the Coloretto mould, such as the possibility of getting rid of animals you don't want. There's more obviously direct player interaction in this game, which makes it a little more robust, but it's not something I need to own.

Dull and obvious set-collection mechanics combined with luck-of-the-draw loading on trucks, almost completely identical to Coloretto, right down to the blind luck of hoping more people than average happen to avoid your colors / animals.

Tightly knit auction/set collection game with the guise of building a zoo. I've played Coloretto online quite a bit and I must say I like this iteration much more. The one complaint is that the game is mean by nature, taking someone's truck, or forcing them to take one that gives them only negatives. That aside, the theme really pulls this game together. Worthy of the Spiel it won in 2007

Very impressed, and for the first time, I see what the whole Spiel de Jahres "feel" is about. This feels like a wonderful family game. Familiar feel and pace to Coloretto, but nice, subtle nuances. A bit more than a filler, a bit lighter than a main course - it fills a nice niche as an accessible, very playable game that fills 30-45 minutes rather nicely. [UPDATE] Wow. Even more impressed. Ben, who is just four and a half now, can mechanically play the game and actually WON our last game, basing all decisions on what animals would be the "coolest" to have in the zoon. Great, great family game.

RATING: 8
I think Zooloretto is a very cute, and clever family game. The theme goes over well with kids, and casual gamers. The gameplay is mostly on the pleasant side, but you can play a bit more cutthroat if you choose to do so. I recommend it to other families.

We now play it with the Petting Zoo, the Three Additional Buildings, and the Savings Book mini expansions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Great gateway game.  Plays best with 4.  3 and 2-player rules as written are weaker but can be improved by removing some tiles as recommended below.  Overall prefer Aquaretto but will always introduce this first to new players.

Recommended tile distros:

3-Player animal vending coin
Printed -- 6x11 -- 4x3 -- 12
Variant -- 6x10 -- 4x2 -- 10

2-player
Printed: animal-5x11 vending-4x3 coin-12 expansion-2
Variant: animal-6x10 vending-4x2 coin-08 expansion-1

Expansions:
Petting Zoo: Essential (Safety valve for extra babies and adds a bit of money)
Polar Bear: Very Good (Simple and fun)
Gorilla: Very Good (More powerful than polar bear)
Building Sites: Good (Better when removed from game after repair vice passed)
Additional Buildings: Good (Souvenir shop too strong - better used as just 2 points)
Mission Cards: Good
Extra enclosures: Ok
Saving Book: Ok

RATING: 7
Hard not to compare this with Coloretto, which might be my favorite filler.  There is a larger decision space in Zooloretto but being able to make those money moves takes a fair amount of tension out of the game too.  I've only played once with my kids and it seemed pretty easy to fill up your enclosures... but we weren't playing at all cut throat in the truck filling stage either so that might change with more mature players.  Regardless, this was a great first "heavier" (or at least non-kid) game for my kids.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Fun little game. Interesting to see how a "one-mechanic" game like Coloretto can evolve into a slightly more involved board game - almost a lesson in game design. This game in itself is light fun, but I'm not sure this will be a keeper over the long haul.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A lighthearted game that plays really quick.  The funnest thing about Zooloretto is the look on your opponent's face when you drop an animal he doesn't want into the tray he's been drooling over.  I would defeinitely recommend you to include the expansion, it made the experience a lot smoother.  A very accessible game for everyone, although not one I'd get back to very soon.

Update #1: Really did not like this as a 2-player.  Possibly one of the blandest and most boring sessions I've participated in.  Nothing interesting ever happens, and it seems like there is too much money available.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I love the basic system of Zooloretto, but what really makes it shine is the capability for expansion.  There are lots of things you can do (and Michael Schacht has already done!) to add on to the game.  Plus, the game can be quite nasty at times.  I like it a lot.

Burgers Zoo, a game which the rest of the world might know as Zooloretto, is one of the earliest games in our collection. It was added in the time that we didn’t know that their are sites on the Internet which handles about boardgames. The way we decided to buy a game, was by looking at the boxfront, and read the few lines of text on the back of the box. Also the Dutch name of the game, was a way to convince us, to buy this game, as Burgers Zoo, is one of the most (if not, the most) beautiful zoo in The Netherlands. P. was very happy with this game as a birthday-present back then. But the happiness didn’t last long. After playing the game, we discovered it wasn’t a fun game. This was the first bad buy of a game, and as M. paid more then the price it is in stores nowadays, it was just a waste of money. We never played it again, and didn’t understand why this one is high ranked at BGG. Today we decided to give it a second change. Maybe we just missed something in this game.

In a players turn, a player can do three things:

    Take a tile out of the bag, and place it on a empty spot in a cage
    Do a paid action (pay 2 money to sell animals, pay 1 money to the bank and 1 money to another player to buy a animal from him, pay one money to redesign the zoo)
    Take a cage and pass.

It’s clear that the first action brings a lot of luck with it. But that’s not the problem with the game. When playing with two players (as we did), you remove three species of animals from the game, but the rest of the species stay completely in the game. We think that’s the main problem, as it’s no problem for both players at all, to fill the cages with the same kind of animals. Which result at the end of the game, that it’s likely that both of the players were able to fill all of the cages and build all of the attractions. Money isn’t a big problem in a two player game, so normally, each player will be able to sell the animals the couldn’t place. The result is, that at the end of the game, both players have the same amount of points. The only difference probably will be the amount of money, that they have left. And the amount of money they will get, is luck depended, is it comes out of the bag. I can see, this can be fun with two parents and two kids, but when you want to play this just with two players. Don’t do it.

j'aime bien ce genre de jeu à la mécanique simple dans lequel le hasard et la stratégie sont habillement mélangés; difficile d'établir une stratégie à long terme toutefois (ce qui peut contribuer à accélérer le jeu, ce que j'aime bien, puisque j'ai parfois une certaine tendance à me casser la tête avant de jouer :))

RATING: N/A
My initial impression of this is that the system is brilliant but there are too many damn plays. I know the very basics of american football play calling and I can't just pull out what I want from the big stack. It doesn't help that the plays are really outdated as well. The clear cards are seriously cool.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Exciting little game. The playbook alone is worth the price of admission. Frankly, I never did like the randomization device. I had an edition that used 2D6 but traded it away because none of my friends play sports games.

RATING: N/A
To this day, its the best football board game out there.  If you don't care about individual players and teams, and just want to get right down to football X-O tactics in a game designed to keep things moving fast ... this is it.  The clear defensive plays sliding over the offensive plays is a simple mechanism that is genius.  It simplifies looking through complex charts and keeps the game moving along fast.

I used to love this game as a kid, because the game is placed on real play calling, instead of just rolling dice or hitting buttons on your Mattel Electronic Football game.

This is a great football strategy game.  I think my wife sold it at garage sale when I wasn't paying attention.  I actually had a league at work with this game.  Very cool.
Update: I have purrchased three copies off e-Bay.  Hut, hut, hike!

RATING: 5
Well-intended effort suffers from too few plays and the results seem unrealistic, especially in the case of the spring-loaded (diceless) version -- which after hundreds of trials didn't even come close to its purported distribution.

RATING: 6
This offering is getting a little long in the tooth, but at the height of football season, it's fun to pull this out and try your hand at play calling.  This reminds me a bit of the Sports Illustrated College Football game my dad used to own when I was growing up with an added spring-loaded randomizer thrown in.  Not something I'd want to play often, but when the football juices are flowing, a good one to help cool the fever. [Thrift $1.09]

I am a football board game collector of sorts.  This recent purchase is easily one of the best football games I have (maybe the best!)  Has all the elements that I'd want in a quality football game.  Tudor did this one up right! Too bad they aren't still in production.  All the components are unique and well made.  I own the 1979-1981 version. This game is well worth the purchase and your time to play it.  Loads of strategy.

I also own the Deluxe Briefcase version.  It is by far and away the best football game - I own.  Total quality!

RATING: 6
Took a while to complete a half. I think playing time of an hour is highly unlikely unless there are more than one version of this. It is almost an elongated game of bluff against your opponent with a dice roll for probable outcome. Doesn't sound very exciting but after a while I started to understand the strategy of an NFL Coach (possibly) Well I felt I learnt a little bit more about American Football itself which is good. I certainly enjoyed the game we played. 1 Play.

Be aware that there are earlier versions of this game (I recall playing it in the mid-1970s) which are basically the same but have play selections more appropriate to their era.  For instance, I don&#039;t believe you will find single-back formations in the earlier editions.  The earlier editions can be identified by the use of a bead/spring/rod randomizer instead of dice.  Note also that this is a &quot;pure&quot; football strategy game, with no real statistics used and no difference between teams.

I really enjoyed the game as a kid, I liked the clear cards that when laid over top of each other, you can see how the play is going to happen, and the different cards tick off different amounts of time, plus the bouncing ball bouncing ball thing is preatty neat.

The spring mechanism was a poor randomizer; you could dictate the result you wanted about 80% of the time. Video games pretty much have rendered this sort of game obsolete, anyway.

I played this quite a bit as a teenager in the early 70's. Great components, especially for the time, and lots of play choices. The randomizer always gave you a chance to get the big play or foil your best plans. Seemed to track real football.

My edition of this game has the bead/spring/rod randomizer. That randomizer had a tendency to lose its zip so the spring didn't react after a while, leaving the game to be almost unplayable. The 5.5 rating of course is for a game in good working condition.

Great game and one of the few my big bro would play with me at the drop of a hat!

Very odd randomizer in some versions of this game the game that involved beads on a wire... (seriously)  I always hated it (as a hardcore boardgamer I liked dice) and my psudo-jock brother loved it!  

Re-aquired after traggic flood of '82 but it is down at the parents...so I can still kick my big brothers arse when we are down for the holidays!

One of the best realistic football games out there, with true to life results and good strategy options.  Dozens and dozens of offensive plays, and a good number of defensive plays, and outcomes based on likelihoods (i.e. a given offense against a particular defense has a 5% chance of X, a 25% chance of y, a 35% chance of Z, etc.).  It even adjusts the result based on what hash you're running from.  Only drawback is no customizable teams, but very solid nonetheless, and playable in a short time.

Simply the greatest football game ever designed, period.

Owned the original version with the result determined by the ball-on-spring-pole, and now have the newer version that uses dice, and has updated plays to account for man-in-motion, and more aggressively mobile quarterbacks.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Hits a sweet spot, for me anyway, between abstraction (there are no real-world team or player stats) and detail (shows interactions between numerous offensive and defensive plays, with variances based on where the ball is spotted). Kind of like a super-deluxe version of Football Strategy. Great fun to play and results are reasonably realistic - it "feels" like American football. The Vassal mod is a huge asset.

Played it endlessly as a kid. It's an early 70's version that doesn't look exactly like any of the others here. I should post a photo. The rubber roller on the clock has gotten hard and tacky with age. Maybe could play it with dice.

A great game where both sides are on equal footing, so it is the players' play calling that wins the day. Later versions had a good amount of plays, and pass-friendly results (per latest NFL rules). When overlaying the defense card on top of the offense card, a graphic of the play is shown - love it! This is my favorite of this genre.

I had a version of this game (1981) as a kid; it used to bug us to no end that the rules seemed incomplete, UNTIL you flipped the box over and you found them there.

The timecard never worked well, but the strategy book really helped me understand offensive and defensive strategy in football (without having to actually play organized football).

Lot's of actual football strategy here right down to the play rsults based on where the ball is on the hashmarks. Placing the offense and defense cards together in the board produced several windows showing possible results that were determined by flinging a football springy thing-a-ma-bob.

Loved this game when I was in junior high.  I think it was the cool play cards and overlays.  Now, though, I resent the fact that there are no 'teams' in the sense that either side might have different capabilities.  Just got the supercool leather case edition that uses dice instead of the little beads.  There are more plays than I remember, I think the different editions had different sets of play cards.  Cool!

My favorite football game. Works like [GAMEID=951] in that both players choose plays which are cross-indexed, but adds a wrinkle in that instead of a fixed result, an appropriate range of possible results are possible for any given combination. Versions vary, some use a flipper, and others dice, but either way you came up with a nice probability spread for any given play vs. any given defense. The plays themselves are presented graphically, with transparent plastic offense cards laid over opaque defense cards to see a diagram of each player's assignment. Very nice!

Very under-rated (assuming you understand the plays) football game. More about play selection than the teams. "Randomizer" (aka football on a spring) can be easily converted to percentile dice for the more anal-retentive, but hey, it's a FOOTBALL game, ok? Rate a 4-5 without the play summaries, 8 with.

Randomizer is certainly neat.  As far as football simulations goes, this is an interesting one.  Doesn't have the same replayability as the team-focused ones like [gameid=5740] or [gameid=3226].  Still, the plays are intuitive, and this is an excellent introduction to the strategy of football for young fans or for ones less familiar with the game.  The playbook is very illuminating, and describes some of the basic ideas behind the plays, which is really fascinating.  Keep in mind that this is from the 70s or 80s, and that the predominant strategy of the game was run first, pass for the big play only.  Almost every set is two back, and you aren't going to find anything like the spread offense or empty backfield, so if you are looking for cutting edge, you'll have to modernize it to some degree.

Obviously not a wargame. It was one of those games that all the football fans in our wargame club loved to play during football season.
We wore out the spring ball and converted the game to percentile dice from D&D. Worked the clock manually. 
It was great. Each player picked a play, offensive or defensive, then laid the defensive card over the offensive card. This created a few different potential outcomes with a percentage chance for each. Placement on the field itself influenced the amount of yards gained or lossed.
We set up leagues and had weekly games. Payed a fee for each game with the players of the super bowl splitting the pot 65-35.
Some of the players even kept stats to have bragging rights about the leading rushers, best defenses, best QB's. Almost became an obsession for some of them.
The plays are badly out of date now. And I haven't played this game in years. But lots of real fond memories. I think I may have even won some money a couple of times.

This has proven to be a pretty good football sim. Added a few houserules to make the game flow better, including using Pizza Box Football timing and the ability to spend a timeout as a reroll (this reduces some of the randomness of those INTs and FUMBLES)

Found this ancient relic on a messy shelf in a goodwill store in Port Angeles, WA for two bucks. Intresting, but better for solataire I think. My copy is missing a few defensive plays, and the "timer" mechanism is iffy at best, but like I said, a unique way at simulating football in those pre videogame years, and it does a good job of teaching you the rather arcane art of play calling in the sport. My copy even has that odd, bead on a string randomizer that I don't think I've ever seen on another game.

Good game for the segment it occupies--fast and easy to learn, though the iconography on the cards is not fully consistent (e.g., sometimes a backslash means "and" while other times it means "or," which admittedly may be something only rules lawyers care about).  However, the game also features my likeness so I'm more apt to overlook this minor criticism.  ;-)

Plays better, in my opinion, with more players, as auction bidding and card drafting both become more tense.  Lots of great add-ons in the Kickstarter version.

Una especie de 7wonders de creacion de peliculas.
El juego tal y como salio es entretenido pero tiene algunos puntos flojos, sobretodo el tema de las pujas y las puntuaciones. 
Si le metes las cartas customizadas de caricaturas de actores que se curro alguien y aplicas algunas "house rules" en las pujas y en las puntuacion final, el juego mejora bastante y es bastante jugable.

RATING: 6
Really cool theme of being a movie studio and putting together a movie for money. The components are okay and the art is neat.

The punishing blind bidding mechanic is what drives the game. Card drafting is only slightly strategic because most decisions are obvious and rely on luck to really be put together. The auction for cards can quickly go sideways and not really benefit players.

Roleplaying this helps since decision space is limited. Game lends itself to negotiation.

Interesting game that does auctions and drafting together fairly well. You're trying to make movies and you need scripts, directors, actors/actresses. Supporting cards like SFX guys add to the value of the movie. Auctioning happens for the Star cards, which are better cards than regular cards, so you basically spend your points to get cards to get you more points. It's also fun to try and describe your movies at the end of the rounds.

Maybe the best board/card game about the movie making process. The mechanics are streamlined and work well. I would've preferred a little more complexity (that is, a little more detail about the movie making process) but as is, the game is fairly easy to teach. 

I wish the game gave us different cards for the different directors, actors, actresses, and crew. I have the expansions, which do add some variety and uniqueness to the game play. If you are looking to buy a copy (second hand) look for someone who is also selling the expansions. This really livens game play, particularly the Darker Side of Hollywood, because it ramps up interaction between players.

I'm not a big fan of drafting games, but drafting works well here. 

The game is fun. It's somewhat challenging to put together movies from the cards that you draft.

Tentative grade after one 3-player game at Essen 2013. Card drafting to get a good set of director, script, stars and assorted other movie production staff to produce high grossing movies. VP = money earned.

Has some filler potential.

Not planning on buying this myself, but I'll play someone else's copy. ;-)

A significant surprise.
I was expecting very mediocre game and instead I got an enjoyable, if unoriginal (drafting+bidding), experience.
There are emotions, interesting decisions and dilemmas here.

Almost a filler for veteran gamers and a full-fledged game for others.  It should work in both groups.

EDIT: Surprisingly, 2-player mode is exciting!

The way this game plays is great, it really does feel like your putting a movie together..(well as much as a card game can do) The biding is fun, and the trying to get the awards is great, BUT. Its missing something, and that something is something it could never get. Celebrity names!  Creatively it is a great game, but its missing the laughs.  Sure you can say the actor is Jim Carrey, but you are making it random, not the game so it well be a forced crazy if you name them yourself. Having the cards tell you that Steven Spielberg is making the Shining with Louie C K is great!  Also, there is a lot of math….just a statement, not a negative or positive comment.
I know there is a pdf someone made to make cards with celebrity caricatures on them, and I think that is great and would boost this 100%, but until I put my time in making those myself maybe I well just write names on the cards.
*Update* I would up the rating by 2 when you mod the game! I was right! I printed up replacements for directors,actors and actress and it is FUN with real names of people, it makes crazy funny movies. and putting people in it that others don't like is even better, because know there hate can give you a card you could use...

RATING: 2
Broken at the very start - with more than 2(!) players you can easily clash in the pre-game auction - with 6 players you're more than sure to do so.

Also with a 4-player game we ended the first cycle with only 2 people being able to make a movie in the first round, no director. Didn't even play further

RATING: 7
Drafting game with somewhat medium weight among the plethora of drafters out there. The film-making theme fits very well, art is nicely done. Would've preferred Oscar meeples above golden 'Christmas tree' meeples. Losing money when u loose an auction and then having to join the auction again felt a little awkward. But the auction of star cards gives a nice opportunity to get that one card you still want.

A drafting game that I actually like. There is an auction and a possible card exchange to mitigate poor options, and each round stands on its own so bad luck doesn't build on itself (I'm looking at you, 7 Wonders). Presenting your movies leads to some awesome stories and tabletalk.

Very nice drafting card game with an unusual theme and good-looking art.

PROS
- Easy to explain and learn, making it accesible to non-gamers
- Not common theme, which is always appreciated
- Friendly and nice-looking graphic design

CONS
- It may be a little repetitive by the third round
- When someone gains both "Oscars" in the first 2 rounds, they're gonna win that game whatever you do. Just... don't let them do so

RATING: 7
To start let me just say in caps and bold: IGNORE THE START OF THE GAME AUCTION TO BE THE ONE TO DISTRIBUTE THE SPECIAL CARDS...
The way it works has got to be one of the most stupid things I've ever seen in a game! Just deal 1 card to each player and that's that!

Regarding the game, it's a cool Drafting game with a splice of auction thrown in... it's not a blow your mind game, it's pretty simple and plays very fast...
I like drafting and I liked the game... it's a cool gateway game because it's easy to play and fast playing.
One thing that goes against those points is the scoring system that isn't very "friendly" requiring the player to do a lot of adding and multiplying

A fairly light card drafting/auction/set collection game that is easy to learn and play. This game truly shines with higher player numbers and people who are creative and can get into the movie-making theme! The only problem the game has involves a scoring mechanic that puts a huge amount of emphasis on a single strategy (movie of the year awards) without requiring any particular skill to pull it off and just as often as not comes down to the luck of the cards.

Due to the rampant runaway-leader problem caused by the "movie of the year" mechanic, this game has been sold.

I guess you can describe this game the best as Dream Factory from Knizia with only 1 auction (for special cards) and with cards you get using the drafting mechanism from 7 Wonders. Nevertheless you get a family stylish game that works and plays fast enough. 

The only thing that worries me a bit is that there is no safety net for if you have no director (as you have the worthless script for a script), because if you can't make a movie in 1 of the just 3 rounds, I think you're screwed for the rest of the game. It luckily didn't happen in our game and then you have a nice, lighter game.

RATING: 7
An interesting drafting game. It's around a 7 Wonders level of complexity and randomness, with some bidding thrown in and a bit more interaction with the other players.
A few issues keep it from being great:
-I don't really like the bidding mechanic, where you lose your bid even if you don't win the thing you were bidding for.
-The rule for "Oscars" tiebreakers is a bit sloppy, basically the group just decides who to give it to.
-There is also a lot of arithmetic during the movie-constructing and scoring phases, and it feels like the game would be better with player aids or more intuitive scoring to make this faster.

I learnt about Hollywood two years after its Kickstarter campaign, but got imediately interested. Purchase was difficult due to rare stock in Germany, therefore I got the version with stretch goals from a gamer fellow. 
Hollywood made me very happy, because it's easy, very fast, but has nevertheless a nice complexity. Great Game.

RATING: 5
Strongly dislike blind bidding points, losing points even when you lose a bid, and being forced to bid multiple times in the event of a tie. Totally unforgiving mechanic that drags the whole experience down. The actual drafting is okay, but it is kind of bogus that taking a neutral director is sometimes better than actually playing out the draft. Creating a movie has too many requirements, and the deck is so big that sometimes pure luck of the draw will prohibit some players from scoring.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Pretty boring game.  Nothing particularly special at all.  The bidding is a bit pointless later on as you have so much money and why would you play this when you can play a better card drafting game like 7 Wonders?

Played once with 4P. If there's anything [thing=73][/thing] and [thing=904][/thing] taught us, it's that set collection and the show business theme go hand in hand. Hollywood has players go through the usual shtick of assembling a movie cast, but this time through a draft. What matters in the end is the financial value of the end product, so there are ways to manipulate that value through leading duo sets, film crew and the like.

I have three nitpicks about the game. The first is that the blind bid auction at the end of every round feels contrived. It's difficult to glean information from the draft about what other players are aiming for, so the bid is quite a crapshoot as you may end up overpaying for something that you think is in demand. 

The second nitpick is that the draft can be unbalanced if one of the key elements of making a movie is in shortage; in one of the rounds I played there was only 1 proper script in the draft, so the player who chanced upon it got lucky. The third is that there is a minor kingmaking element in the way ties for awards are handled as the non-tied players vote for the winner, but I'd like to think that the one game I played is a rare exception.

Fortunately, Hollywood plays briskly enough that those concerns never become too overpowering. Fairly acceptable filler fare.

RATING: 6
This is a pretty lightweight drafting game with a brutal blind bidding mechanic.  The strategy behind drafting in this game suffers heavily with more players and ultimately becomes a game of latching on to a single card for that round and hoping for synergistic cards to come your way.

It feels like a really cool drafting game that's essentially a watered down retheme of 7 Wonders/Sushi Go... it has several similar mechanics. It's a fun drafting game. There's a little to much setup for the game time/fun factor, but I did enjoy the theme and had fun.

tl;dr: it works*

*if you have the special cards that let you take a director in case you don't have one.

So my friend first played this without the above mentioned cards. It's a drafting game and if you don't get any directors by drafting - which is possible - you don't get to make any movies. Not only is this unrealistic (some movies clearly were not directed by anyone), it also screws that player with little chance to recover.
But with the cards there, the game works. It works just fine. Draft some cards, make the right gambles and get lucky with what you draft... or not.
The game doesn't do anything new or exciting, so while I was happy to play it, I don't think I would ever request to play it myself. I think it's a bit too chaotic for that, especially with the special action cards that are in the deck.

- (Minor) Slightly finicky score board (prefer poker chips)
- Tie-breaking mechanism for award

On Blind Bidding:
It just makes sense thematically - you are production companies trying to recruit the best talent in the industry, and you're wining, dining, just trying to impress them so they'll sign up with you. All the while, you may have no idea what your competition are doing at the same time. If you have watched TV shows like Californication or Entourage, you'll know what I'm talking about. In the game, it forces you to make smart bidding decisions and deal with the consequences of competition.

Meh. It works, but it's really much less interesting than something like 7 Wonders (and I am not a huge fan of 7 Wonders). There is really only one thing to do - make high-scoring movies. There is a little tension between making the absolute highest-scoring movies and making movies that score a bit less but win awards, but not enough.

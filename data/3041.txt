RATING: 6
A Jim Dunnigan classic that has endured. In his style, he uses a small set of rules to capture large swaths of history. In this case, you get the German blitzkrieg tactics and pincher moves via overrun rules and the German ability to move, fight, and move again. Soviets have leaders that limit their ability and untried units whose combat values are unknown to both sides until they commit to battle.
The biggest downsides are that the game is kind of long and you do need tweezers to play this.

What a simple system, and what a operational tense game it is. So far, this game is one of the best eastern front game.

Fantastic 2 player game that exciting to play either side. Excellent solitaire game that is so elegantly done, that replay ability is huge.

This is one game that keeps you holding your breath to the very last turn.

No other game currently in print has kept me so tense throughout.

Initial rating after 1 play.  The Germans have to wade through a swamp of Russian units.  Really unique mechanics with Russian unit strength unknown until they are revealed in combat.  Also units can retreat rather than take step losses, which is almost always a good idea.  

For me this game has aged relatively well.  I've played the SPI version.  Apparently the Avalon version might have more complete rules.

One of the better "old-style" hex and counter games; although the odds are stacked somewhat against the Ruskies.

The "random" untried Soviet units make it more suitable for solo play and, at least at first, stops the very gamey soak-off tactic common to its genre.

RATING: 6
Owned the 1976 S&T magazine version.  Played my brother FTF twice, and soloed 3-4 times since.  I appreciate the outstanding system; clean, elegant, effective.

But for me, the situation is just too one-sided to be replayable fun.  Yeah, yeah, I've read plenty of grognard paens to the joy, subtlety, balance, et al, yadda yadda, of the system, and how they actually think the Russians are slightly favored.  Fine, but the bald truth is that barring very poor Ger play, or gawdawful dice, it will predominantly be a German cakewalk/bug hunt of Russian stacks.  I don't know the amount of times you'd need to play to attain the ZEN RUSSIAN MASTERY in PGG, but I've decided it's not worth the time investment to find out.  

Okay for solitaire a few times, or for someone who feels the need to play the Russians as an act of penance.  The  penitential act goes like this -- set up Russ stacks, see Russ stacks get blown away, flee east, set up more Russ stacks, see Russ stacks get blown away...

When this game first came out I thought the system was groundbreaking with unknown Soviet strength units and German panzer divisions being able to get a divisional integrity bonus if all 3 of its regiments were stacked together.  But you also had the option to break it out into its individual regiments if you needed to hold more ground.

I played the S&T version a few times and really had fun with this one.  Very simple rules, but a lot of replay possibilities.  Both sides have advantages and disadvantages.

Excellent game with untried units rules! The PGG system is a very nice one to use for operational level wargames. Reincarnated (with a few new bells and whistles) in the PC game Unity of Command.

Thoroughly enjoyed it those times I played it. Would rate higher, but I no longer want (or am able) to play games that take a whole day to play any more. If I still played traditional wargames like this, I'd rate it at least a 7 (if not an 8 for introducing some groundbreaking -- for its time -- mechanics).

RATING: 7
A classic hex-and-counter game, the down side is that aspects of it are dated, and particular rules (like the Soviet partisan counter) are odd.

Most recent play as German resulted in my raising the rating by a point.  The Axis must balance overruns and other aggressiveness with maneuver to literally run circles around the Soviet before they can adapt.

I wish half the games released today had rules this clear and play this engaging.

And, capping it all off -- where are your _good_ troops!

Avalon Hill.  Solid, intense, good 1:1 war game done as a recreation of the game of the same title by SPI.   The questionable Russian unit strength adds a nice dimension to the game and does a fair job of simulating unit quality at the beginning of the war for the Russians.  The game is very playable, but sometimes lopsided. This game is best played twice with the players switching sides after the first game.

My first wargame, well balanced, fun to play, not overly complicated.
The fact that Soviet troops are drawn hidden to both players, gives a nice fog of war thrill. Also gives the soviet the challenge to re-organize his trop in an efficient way.
The soviet challenge is to slow the German as much as possible.
The German must rush to the east with his panzers and protect the rear with the infantry.
Both roles are challenging, a fun game to play.

Enjoyable game. Nice rules include unknown Soviet unit quality until combat (2-sided counters with no combat factors on the one side - flip the counter when first in combat).

Ground breaking game design, and one that brought a lot of people to the hobby. While the unknown units had been used previously in 'Invasion: America', other concepts such as overrun, choice of losses (step loss or retreat) and other little nuances made the game a landmark design.

Still holds up today as a great game.

This is a classic for a reason: it successfully captures mobile warfare in WW2 and is a fun challenge too. 
 
Berg and Dunnigan crafted a system that really highlights the differences between the two sides. Primarily the Soviets have to cope with untested units and command problems, though they have the ability to rapidly move units up to the front. Army Group Center gets a huge mobility advantage - a second movement phase - but has to be wary of overextenidng themselves.

RATING: 9.5
Simply and perfectly badass
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a game with easily absorbed, easy to understand rules with a well balanced situation and a host of workable strategies for both sides that will keep the end in doubt for most playings until the last bullet is fired.  No simulation  perfectly represents reality, but this is in the ballpark for simulating much of what the commanders had to face.  The German Commander has to push forward with almost reckless abandon to win, while the Soviet Commander has to skillfully resist to the last man in carefully selected places to delay the German Commander enough to allow reinforcements to stabilize a main line of resistance.  In most cases it will come down to the German running out of time to capture enough strategic objectives or the Soviet defence being either out-maneuvered or enough troops being destroyed that the defense collapses.

PGG uses an innovative system of untried Soviet units.  This creates a high degree of uncertainty for both commanders.  Will that hex be filled with Guards quality troops or will they melt away at the first round fired?  Because of this each playing will be most likely different and may require changing plans on the fly.  This will keep your interest game after game...

Panzergruppe Guderian is a true classic, a radical new system that also proved a real player. Single-handedly it launched the modern era of SPI operational games and, after a string of duds, proved that a magazine release could be a worthy game.

A recent playing showed, however, that it has not aged well. The system, that once seemed so clever, has far too many "gamey" elements. Stacking is three units, so the panzer divisions - broken down into regiments - can only stack  1/3 as deep as infantry divisions. "Divisional Integrity" doubles unit strengths, making it way too powerful. ZOCs cannot be exited except through combat. 

Combine this with a tough tactical situation (the German must mass his mobile units and push the overrun rules to their max to get anywhere)  and it all makes an interesting puzzle for some. But not for me. Through in a couple of other "gamey" elements (like the zero strength untried units) and this veers too much toward the puzzle side and too far away from the simulation side for me. I've been spoiled by more modern games and systems.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.7
Very dated...that in some ways has and other ways hasn't stood the test of time. Not surprising order of battle problems especially for the Soviets. It is still better than 'Victory Denied' which was a real disappointment. 

The sticky ZOC rules and German stacking is completely silly. Overblown Soviet air/partisan unit can be easy corrected with house rules. And, then the game is passable.

Great Dunnigan/Simonsen/Berg SPI classic.  I have the SPI Designer Box Edition with mounted maps and matte finish counters.  

To me this is a gamers game that is enjoyable FTF or solo and fun playing either side.  Lots of decision making on where to attack or defend.  Russian partisans rule is brilliant in simplicity and effectiveness. Game really awards proper use of breakthrough, envelopment and reserves behind MLR.

Some of the comments regarding the OOB and geography (distortion) are valid but doesn't diminishing the game at all for me.

If you are a fan of this game do yourself a favor and read the posts on CSW for helpful hints from the masters.

I made a personal CyberBoard game using a scan of the map and then recreated the counters, adding markers, charts and special features that eases game play.

Has not aged well, recent histories show how wrong this game was in simulating the battle, heck even the article in  its issue of magazine contradicts the game- In this g The Germans get to do all of the attacking with the Soviets selecting where to 'Stand and Die' (The sticky ZOC rules means that most of the time, where you place your Soviets is where they will die)...historically the Soviets were counterattacking all the time, quite effectively too.  .

Great game...a true wargaming classic.  Watch for the L2 edition due in 2005.    Still, it's a one-trick pony for me (although a good one!).  Many players will play this repeatedly...I'd prefer to move on to other games.  The reprint will probably be one of the best entry-level wargames available.  Easy rules, plays very fast, offers very different strategy and tactics (pun!) for both sides.

RATING: 7.1
In 2009 I played my first game.  My impression was pretty good.  Pace is slow, especially for the Germans.  Russian troops need to march across the map, but Germans tend to advance and then get mired down.

2011, and I have finally played again.  3.5 hours and we completed 7 of 12 turns.  So the pace, for us, is really slow.  But I thoroughly enjoyed the game, and found the chess-like problems very interesting.

If there was a wargame that could be voted best in the 20th century, this would be it. If you like competitive bidding for victory points, try this one out. No game will be the same, despite the relativly short learning curve. Plays fair in solitare also. There is talk of a remake so keep your fingers crossed for improvements graphically and scenarios too who knows?

A great game, but do to the ability of the Russians being able to withdraw to near the edge of the board as a winning solution, you need to bid on objectives as they do for tournament games.  Easy to learn, lot's of variable play by the Germans and the concept of flipped, unknown strength Russians is great.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
All time classic.  Unknown units.  Just won with the Russians by the skin of my teeth using some of the 0-0 units that were brought back into play and filled the gaps in the line.  If only the German player would have figured it out a little sooner!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is an excellent simulation, as the Germans advance rapidly and are superior in battle to the Soviets, who nevertheless fight tough and continually bring in reinforcements, gradually slowing German advances. 

Under these conditions, the Germans have 12 turns to grab as much territory as they can. As the rounds proceed the drama and tension increase. 

The supply rules for the Germans are a bit fiddly, but one can easily remedy that with one's own variation. 

Very fun and challenging to play, and I found this one relatively easy to learn. I can understand why there's still an annual championship tourney for this game, as it seems to me it could play out differently virtually every time it's played. 

I love the big (22 x 32") map and when standing and looking at the small counters I really feel like I'm playing a war game, in that I can really see where units are and what's happening and what I might do next. And, I continue to see this playing out differently every time I play, in addition to finding myself thinking immediately upon completing a game what I'd do differently next time. All this really impresses me about this game. 

Took some time to rewrite the rules into simpler English and ended up with a 2-page quick-reference sheet before starting to play.

Acquired in trade, June 2008, when I played it for the first time. Had the 32 x 22" map laminated in medium-weight plastic, which really makes it look great. Raised rating from 8 to 9 after additional plays, February-March 2013.

RATING: 7
Just like many gamers I came to the hobby through this game. Nostalgia, nostalgia!

It has a high replay value, thanks to the unknown strength of the Soviet units. Truly a game innovation when it was first published!

Some gamers rated it 10, because of its unique position in the hobby. I believe it is too much for a 30 years old game.

I must confess that the game system did age well, in spite of locking ZOCs. It is still a fun game with a lot of qualities, for sure. But, I sold my old AH copy, anticipating the L2 "reprint" that I've been impatiently waiting for years...

A classic game, but with only one scenario and no follow ups, which limits it. I played this at university and remember the first time my opponent spread out his Russian units is a single stacked mass which was difficult for the Germans to surround and destroy.

Still uniquely different, and a challenge for both sides every time. A very underestimated design reflecting respective doctrine correctly: the Germans must overrun and keep mobile using Blitzkrieg tactics; the Soviets must attack with overwhelming odds where possible and keep elements in the German rear alive. The Soviet 0-0-6s still shock, and the split retreats of German armoured units is as painful as ever.

RATING: 6
As "pure game" PgG is probably a strong "8" -- the gross disparity between German and Soviet play to me is an insurmountable drawback against 'game perfection' but, make no doubt, this is a strong and entertaining game.  As History the abstractions and outright flaws present serious challenges. For my taste, the number and degree of these abstractions and self-paraody borders on the extreme.  PgG seems to produce acceptable levels of outcomes for the "known" German panzer forces, albeit with very high levels of abstraction and design for effect.

One of my first wargames and despite being about 20years old still holds up very well. It is simple (for a wargame) plays quickly, it's tense and has lots of decisions.

This thing just screams "WARGAME".  It is wargamey.  It is just so damned cool.

I believe I never purchased this until now owing to a printing error--when they first published this, Avalon Hill indicated a complexity rating of "9" in its price list, which turned me off immediately.

It's not just that Guderian is on the cover--this actually shares a lot with France 1940.  Except this is a bit more fun.  Same designer, same mech movement phase, same look.

A friend of mine introduced me to PGG nearly 15 years after it's initial release.  One of the best.

This title has a lot to recommend it for play. The whole game is about a German offensive towards Moscow in 1941, so it's one sided in terms of who does the attacking. Using an untried unit system similar to the one pioneered in Invasion: America, the Soviets have unknown combat values while the Germans have multiple combat steps. The object of the Soviets is to slow down the Germans, the Germans object is to get as far east as possible while causing massive casualties to the Soviet. The ZOC is locking, so the only way out after moving adjacent is combat. The German enjoys an advantage of two movement phases for mechanized units, plus doubled strength for divisions that maintain their integrity. Despite the seeming one sidedness of play, the game is exciting and often plays down to the wire. The Soviet player must be an expert at fighting withdrawal, lest he be trompled strongly from the very start.

Fun little game that manages to really fire me up even with it's foibles. Can't wait to compare it against A Victory Denied.

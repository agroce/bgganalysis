GAME: Vs System 2PCG: The Marvel Battles
RANK: 2531
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Initial impressions: Gameplay is fast paced and enjoyable. I like being able to attack specific enemies and how the rows work. I like this a lot better than attacking and letting the opponent choose who to block with, like Magic. That's not a bad way to do things but the board state can grind to a standstill where neither player can attack and you have to wait for a new card to give you an advantage. Here you can usually at least try to stun one character and there are battles nearly every turn.

The game mechanisms seem like they create balanced play but the balance of the individual cards is questionable, though perhaps that is a function of the limited card pool. For instance, Yondu seems good in any core deck but may become sub-optimal with continued releases and as archetypes diversify. Some of the main characters are just awful and then there are ludicrously overpowered cards like Thanos. 

Having a full play set in a box is a definite selling point, even if the card pool is smaller. A $26 buy-in for one core vs the three boxes for FFG LCGs is a definite winner in my book. The lack of monthly chapter packs is a plus for me because of my budget and my desired level on engagement. 

Very happy to have this to play around with. A soft 7 for now, feels like it might go up.

Very interesting card game.  Building around a Main Character means that there's a lot of variety in deck design, and the game play is pretty solid.  Plus, games mixing IPs doesn't bother me.  Great product.

If I get tired of dueling in Dice Masters or HeroClix, this is a nice backup with a strictly card setup. I think in terms of theme though I'd rather play Legendary, but I'll follow this one for awhile.

I love this game, and I'm hoping to add an expansion soon.  Haven't tried playing with more than 2 players (but it was designed for 2, so probably will stick with that), but I enjoy the 2 player battles I have had so far.  I have yet to build my own deck, but just playing with the 4 default "team" decks has been a lot of fun.

The rules booklet comes with suggested easy/medium/hard deck lists so we threw together a few easy decks and gave it a play. It is similar to the original card game version but it has been simplified and a lot of the silly combo aspects have been removed.
Both of the decks were fairly balanced against each other, and both 'masterminds' only had a single point of damage remaining meaning the game COULD have gone either way.

I suspect this will get a fair few more plays in as the b/f enjoyed the original game a lot.

RATING: 7
It's basically MTG with Marvel Superheroes, and that isn't a bad thing. The rules are a little more fast and loose, but it's essentially the same game. The major differences are that you can commit any card to use as "mana," you choose your targets when attacking, and there are two lines your characters can exist in. Oh, and you're on the battlefield, too. In this way, this felt like the precursor to Pixel Tactics, but I enjoyed this far more. PT is just a chaotic mess. 

This still suffers from a lot of the same problems Magic has, however. Some games play on autopilot, it's difficult to come back when you're getting beaten down, and sometimes you just don't get the cards you need. I'd agree with others also that building a deck of different factions is almost not worth it due to minimizing team attacks, but due to the small card pool (so far at least), it might be fun to experiment.

This isn't a MTG killer, but if you want something more focused on the characters duking it out than an overall strategy, this game works very well for that. In this way, VS has almost completely killed my appetite for Dice Masters, especially since it's non-collectable. Time will tell, but this may overshadow it in the long run.

[COLOR=#FF0000] Updated thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]After finding out we had been playing a major rule wrong we began enjoying the game much less. Yes we could just house rule it, but it just didn't feel right once we figured out our mistake (we readied cards that were stunned the next turn). This lead us to revisit Summoner Wars which has taken my house by storm again and with the additional tactics of playing on a board lead my kids and I to decide SW is the superior game.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]39 plays in one year is a lot, but I'm actually surprised it wasn't more. This is still, hands down, the best superhero game I've played. Marvel VS does a great job getting the theme across, all of the different character powers make sense with the character and are also fun to use (Hulk might still be my favorite). The only thing holding VS back from getting more plays is the set up/play time. We need to commit to at least 45 minutes so it's not quite as easy to get to the table as RftG, but every time we play it usually results in us playing a few days in a row. We've gotten the Defenders expansion which adds some great new characters and abilities. 

One thing we haven't gotten into yet is the deckbuilding aspect, typically it's not something I'm interested in doing anymore (since playing Magic way back in the day), but it hasn't affected our enjoyment of the game at all. I've found the pre-constructed decks fun to play, although at some point I may tinker with a deck. 

Unfortunately it seems like this game has caught on, at least not on BGG. I know there was a FB group, I'm interested and hopeful that Upper Deck will continue to support the game. As an aside I'm not sure that I have any interest in the Alien deck, but curiosity may win out. In closing I can't recommend this game enough, especially if you're looking for a great 2p head to head game and you like superheroes.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- An excellent head to head 2p game that was also quite fun as a 3p free for all match.
- The superhero theme shines through, the character abilities fit each of the different characters (Hulk's my favorite).
- There is a ton of variety in this game starting with the possible main characters you can play, the supporting characters, plot twists and then each group of heroes are different from one another (the base game includes the X-men, Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy and Villains).
- Deck building is not usually my thing, but it is really easy to tweak your decks especially since we want to limit each deck to one affiliation.
- Set up is a breeze compared to a game like Marvel Legendary.

This game has become a huge hit with my son and my daughter can't wait to play. I have a feeling this will fill two holes in our collection, both Summoner Wars (a 2+ player fighting game) and Marvel Legendary (a thematic superhero game). This game wasn't even on my radar, but I had an opportunity to play with one of the designers (who I meet through another friend) and had a blast. This game offers everything I wanted out of a superhero game, head to head battles instead of a semi co-op game.[/i]

The perfect game to recreate epic superhero battles.

If you like MTG and Marvel then this is the game for you. It is essentially a self contained and balanced version of MTG.

The game makers have done a fantastic job of making each individual character feel like they're supposed to. for example: Mystique can copy another card's abilities and Hulk gets stronger as he takes more punishment.

Really love this game and hope they continue to incorporate more characters from Marvel.

RATING: 7
This is a game that with expansions I feel is going to get better and better in my eyes.  This initial offering is still good but I think needs a bit more to be great.

This is a re-release of an older Marvel-themed (and later other comics properties) CCG called Vs. System.  The re-release is an LCG instead of a CCG.  Yes, I know that it isn't REALLY an LCG because that is a Fantasy Flight trademark but that's a common term to refer to a card game with deck building that instead of a collectible model offers you all cards from an expansion in one package, so that's the term I'm going to use.  The game is a reasonably simple 2-player card battler, although this offering does include 3 and 4-player rules.  Players take alternating turns playing resources (think land in Magic, there's even the same 1-per-turn limit), using those resources to recruit characters with attack and defense stats, playing plot twist cards (special effects, more often than not affecting character stats in battle), and attacking characters in an effort to knock them out.  The game ends when one player's main character, which they start the game with, is knocked out.

This is accessible, has a great theme, and great artwork.  The tokens, though, are an embarrassment.  Other than that my only quibble is the lack of content but the game just came out.  Some might think 400 cards does not qualify as a lack of content but this makes up 4 different factions.  The starting decks are made up of one faction and use all the characters for that faction and while you can deckbuild and mix-and-match factions it makes sense for a deck to include primarily one faciton with perhaps a splash of complementing characters from another.  There are a few different main characters for each faction but for the most part the number of options is still small in my opinion.  Enough to carry me through until the next expansion which I do expect there to be.  But for most I would say wait until that expansion or more are available.

RATING: 8
Love what they have done with this. The added Main Character really drives the theme of the game way higher than the arbitrary 50 endurance. The changes to flight and range fit very thematically and make perfect sense. The rules have been simplified but dont take that to mean its a simple game. There is still complexity in the card interactions and formation. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
No, it's not the original Vs System. Yes, the cardstock is a little cheap. No, it isn't as complex as the original. Yes, there are some quibbles with the graphic design and a bit of a wasted opportunity with the location cards (especially the unique, faction-specific ones). However, for all of these perceived shortcomings, Vs System is one hell of a fun ride, and --dare I say-- better than the original.

The main character element is a nice addition. The energy/resource system is streamlined and satisfying. The powers are generally thematic and provide some interesting synergies. And I also like the tactical positioning element. All in all, Vs System 2PCG is a great little foundation for what I hope is a decently supported product. With a handful of new factions and hopefully some reinforcements for all the factions in the game, Vs System has the potential to develop into an incredibly solid battling card game. A definite recommendation for any Marvel fan or someone looking to replace MtG or get into a similar game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I've tried most of the major LCG/Expandable Card Games so far (Netrunner, Conquest, LotR LCG, Epic, Ashes, Mage Wars Academy) and this may be one of the best for a casual setting.

The gameplay is super simple and the deckbuilding is easy and you get a ton of variety with one core set. This will likely replace Ashes for me because of those reasons. Ashes has the ease of play and full playset in one box, but it just doesn't feel as well balanced or like you have as many options as this game. And Ashes doesn't include nearly as many different cards.

Will rate after more plays, but this one seems like a keeper.

Update: At this time I own all of the expansions up to the Aliens expansion, and I still think the system is great. There are so many cards that I haven't gotten very heavy into the deckbuilding part, but it seems like you could already build a great variety of different decks.

Really bad game that doesn't deserve carring the VS name. It plays completelly different than the first one to the point it's hardly recognizable. 

The gameplay is a combat based hero vs hero game. It's supposed to be more dynamic and "fun", but it's just plain boring for me. The deckbuilding is really really bad and it only supports soft control and aggro playstyles so far.

The card pool is really small and decks allow to splash cards from different factions which tends to create decks too similar to each other. Expansions will help with that, but at the rate they are planned, I don't think I will stick around for them.

Excellent design; there's clearly been a lot of effort to streamline the mechanics from the original VS. That said, this is really punishing with no catch-up mechanic. I haven't played a lot of games of this that I'd call remotely close.

A very enjoyable game. A few creases in the rules but nothing deadly. Game play is enjoyable and despite some of the criticisms, the internal logic holds up much better than some other ETO's I have played.

Took advantage of Columbia Games' return policy and sent it back at a loss of the cost of shipping. Very upsetting and atypical experience from this publisher. Will be hesitant to back future projects unfortunately. Biggest concern: rules require players to infer and assume far too much. I wish they'd spend more time finishing this title even at the risk of delaying the kickstarter deliveries further. Just a really, very disappointed product here. Be cautious.

About as light as you can get with an ETO and still have a historically meaningful experience. I like addition of primary and secondary targets and the relative low block count. I do not like the card art!

despite criticism you must observe this game from a different point of view.it is not triumph and tragedy
with diplomatic interesting question but is an easy game
of large and loose strategy with a mission.play it and joy.Yes there are holes on rules and i hope in a 2.00 ed.rewrited.But for true there are many many intersting idea a excellent base for a future better game.
remember rules are not a bible.i know many game with fixed rules revised many time and definitely annoying.well i like too the idea and i like the beautiful pieces and colours
the camaign game don't work well because are not balanced
but i work myself for different set up and axis units more stronger.A minimum of fantasy please.
For designer give us a gift.A very large image of the map

RATING: 9
With the rules now fixed up, I like this a lot - streamlined play, open enough to see some entertaining alt-history stuff, quick-moving, by the scale of these things. There are still a few oddities: naval units seem a little powerful with their ability to shore bombard, and the sheer quantity of blocks doesn't really fit into the areas on the West Front. And I wish it played a little faster; figure 10 hours for the whole war - not bad, but it's a mini-monster, and it was advertised as shorter. Still, though, the cards are great, the flexibility is great, and the scale of blocks is more or less perfect - the allocation of each individual block is crucial.

This is one of the better ETO games I've played. While not as tight a design as Europe Engulfed, it's also less rulesy, more interestingly variable, easier to play, more open, and a bit shorter.

The v1 rules were making me nervous, they were a bit of a mess and I wasn't sure if ViE was going to deliver. But now we've got the V1.1 rules, this has felt very solid and has been a lot of fun.
---
Haven't played yet, but it looks like an interesting meld of the old Pacific Victory game system, updated and broadened a bit, with the Hammer-ish event card driver. Like most Columbia games, they re-use and re-mix a lot of their game mechanics so rules-wise it'll feel familiar to fans. Definitely larger than traditional and recent Columbia fare, though, but the game scale and overall size look good. There is definitely some looseness to the rules that is somewhat worrisome and hopefully will be tuned over time, but fans of Columbia's stuff who are familiar with their systems should be able to see their way through without major issues. Looking forward to giving it a try. Think of it as a Columbia-ized Europe Engulfed light.

RATING: 7.5
Kickstarted, received the game on 24th April 2015, after game started shipping mid-February. Rating reflects the poor communications from Columbia Games and bad planning for delivery of game to Europe, plus the numerous concerns being raised over the map not being large enough.
Some of the components are very nice. I love the look of the map. However - the main two issues I have at the moment: The 'Deluxe Mounted board' is nothing of the sort. The map is on thick card, which barely lays flat. The box is not large enough to hold 'sorted' bagged game blocks/sleeved cards. I've resorted to 1) having a slightly larger board printed, mounted on board, and laminated, and 2) purchased an alternative larger box. I have played one uncompleted game which came to a halt due to a rules query. I've upped my rating slightly again following the release of V1.2 of the rules, which will encourage me to get the game back onto the table.

I was expecting Hammer of the Scots mixed with Pacific victory, instead I received a block dense game more complex than PV, probably due to the vagueness of the rules.  Too long.....too vague.....too small.

My very last kickstarter game. Some interesting ideas. The game asks the question: Is it possible to simplify WW2 and still keep the history in it? The answer is, no. While this not the cookie cutter Axis & Allies level, which are ahistorical, this game fails both as a study of history and as a game. The combat system is based on card management and because the set of cards are based on the period of war, the results are very scripted. In general, the combat system is pro defense to help out Russians. GMT had the same issue with its block game of WW2 in Europe. The components of the game are beautiful. The board is too small for the blocks. The gazetteer, which is to add the color and chrome to the game, is poorly written, obscure and should have been developed better. An playbook would have not only been nice but also essential.

First play, 3 players. Started in 1941 with the Barbarossa scenario and finished through winter of '44 -- 12 turns -- in about 6 hours. So about 2 hours per year. We were playing a reasonable pace, so I'm doubtful that play time will decrease too much. I was the Allies, and it looked good for us and the Soviets when we were forced to quit.

Still, a fun game and the most playable WWII strategic game I have played. Rules were not entirely clear, but hopefully some FAQs and living rules will be done. Most things end up "making sense" and producing reasonable situations.

Preliminary rating after 2 plays. I am liking most of it in spite of the usual holes in the history, but attacking is quite difficult.

I dislike the box cover, but I also think Churchill is a contender for the most overrated man in world history.

UPDATE: Heart was in the right place here but the combination of rigid border limits and stacking rules with 2 rounds of combat and low firepower ratings makes the defense superior. A shame because I love the flexible nature of the game in general. History need not be rigidly followed.

A decent game, but for the money you paid for it you would have expected a larger map. I found it was so crowded that the whole thing just turned me off. I have read where many people have gone to a printer and had it enlarged--but why should we have to do that? Sold. Likely my last purchase from Columbia Games.

RATING: 2
The rules are very ambiguous and frankly a mess. We tried playing through a few turns and had so many questions we just threw our arms up in the air. They tried to include everything and the kitchen sink, but streamline it at the same time. What you end up with, is a ton of different types of units and game mechanics that are all highly abstracted and all sorts of questions as to how they interact. The rules read quite well but it plays entirely differently. I'm not going to even bother with it again until they publish a v. 1.1 rulebook.

The circular map was an odd choice and the areas are WAAYYYY too small for the blocks. I love the block sticker artwork though...

The diplomacy system is yet another shitty vestige of A3R where you roll dice to get minors to join your faction. Seriously... Can we take this ridiculous anachronism out to pasture!!! How about a little cause and effect???

EDIT: After 3 attempted plays, I've all but given up on this game. I should have listened to my own advice and waited for the v.1.1 rules. Instead, I've gone from enthusiastic early supporter to disillusioned hater. It's been nearly 4 months since the game shipped an Columbia has not even bothered to update the rules. I could do it for them in a WEEKEND if someone just answered all our questions on BGG...

In the meantime the absurdities that have occurred are growing:
- Belgium joins the Axis.
- Finland joins the Soviets.
- Hungary joins the Allies.
- Battleships are better on land than panzer armies.
- Air units crossing borders block land retreats.
- Italy can be KO'd in 1939.
- USSR invades Germany in 1940 every game.
- Italy and Britain have nothing left to produce and start looking for fights just to kill off steps so they can be rebuilt...

Played it twice (or tried to at least) and both times we spent most of the time digging in the rule book and FAQs online. I'm joining in the (very fair) critique of this game that it's got great potential, but the rules in their current state are a mess. There's supposedly a re-written rule-book coming out soon though, going to give it a shot again when that happens.

There's probably a good game in here, but the poor rule book (very ambiguous in places, poorly structured and lacking some key definitions) has made our first game essentially a play test in order to clarify and fill in the gaps in the rules. I would rate it a '5' straight out of the box for someone who has not played a Columbia block game before. It is only a '7' for me because we could guess the missing rules and clarify some of the ambiguous elements by pouring through the forums here. 

UPDATE: used version 1.1 of the rules in our 2nd game and they seem fairly clear now. But, having lost twice as the Axis in the early stages of the game, I'm wondering what I can do to be more successful? Is the '39 scenario unbalanced or is this the one block game that, for some reason, I'm not very good at playing? 

UPDATE 2: two more games and two early losses for the Axis, one for me and one for my opponent! Then, finally, a win for the Axis on the fifth outing thanks to some mistakes by me as the Allies, as well as some luck on the dice rolls for the Axis. I still think the '39 scenario is unbalanced in favour of the Allies. Furthermore, there is a great deal of luck in the cards, as you receive only half of them for each year and they can range from '0' and no event to '5' and a useful event. For such a lengthy game, this level of luck is too high. This is a shame as the underlying game is very good. Still, I've yet to try the other scenarios.

Read the rules and regret not jumping on KS now despite the high cost. There is a lot of very streamlined chrome here with currently only 8 pages of rules that has me excited. 

We have Leaders, Tanks, Subs, Aircraft carriers, Battleships, Spitfires, Bombers and more. Strategic Bombings on factories or units can be had, lots of terrain effects, weather, there is just a ton of cool detail here all on 8 pages (yes, you read that correctly, 8!) and playable in 4 or 5 hours which in short, is a game I have been waiting forever for and could become a real fav for sure (reminds me of Axis & Allies the block game...hah!)

I have some concerns though, nothing that couldn't be tweaked I don't think, posted one thread here:

Edit - initial reports giving pause for sure, and not liking that they didn't go with an EastFront type HQ or Leader activation system, so sounds like now your able to move ALL your blocks every turn really slowing things down yikes

One of biggest dissapointments of this year.

Clearly game was not playetested very well, by time game arrived in Europe, there was already second version of rules.

I think that fault is clear. CG was marketing this during KS campaing as complete game which will be printed in few months. However by adding of stretch goals, they have changed game very much (it of course depends whether one believes claim that game was complete prior campaing). So through stretch goals they have doubled number of cards, added lot of blocks, etc... Usually such changes would mean that you need to start testing from scratch and that it would take lot of time. Clearly pressure from backers made them to release unfinished game.

It is very funny that author of game (author of my favorite Prussias Defiant Stand) several times mentioned that he may not answer rules question and needs to consult with CG, also stating that he is sometimes playing not according to rules, but according to house-rules. 

One can also mention non-senses like battleships being biggest killers even on land as they can support any fight in coastal area, so they will rip apart anything in big areas. Bombers cannot be escorted by fighters. Uboats being slaughtered by escorts even in 1940 and many other very strange things.

Overall I was really looking towards this game and I was very dissappointed by what was delivered. Based on this I will be very reluctant to buy anything blindly from CG.

The rules are relatively easy to absorb as the combat and movement systems are inherited from the past a lot. However, we do find some little holes here or there which can only be deduced from the designer's intention, e.g. overstacking effect after retreat. Nonetheless, the rulebook is still a joy to read, especially if you have the latest edition v.1.1. Otherwise, you might have a complete different game if you are reading the older version back in 2014 Nov.  (As of Feb, 2017, another version v.1.2 has been issued.)

After playing the game with Chris' copy, I think it grows on me a lot with all the strategic possibilities over the vast expanse of the European map.  I like it as a game and as a simulation of strategic level WWII wargame, true to its name.  Somehow I feel it more authentic than AH's The Rise and Fall of Third Reich, with much less rules overhead.  It's good to the extent that I want to own a copy!  (And I did...game arrives in July 2016).

I must admit I am awed by the huge and strategic scope of the game with such a relative simple set of rules for block wargames. It really suggests that block game system comes to ripe with military simulation.   The changes and variants are subtle and yet the effects are full.  Although I am not a fan of block wargame in particular, eventually I am convinced by its beauty of elegance in terms of system design, what's in and what's abstracted out.

Europe map areas are really too small for comfortable play. The round map was a cool idea, but the blocks are often in a cramped location, a common problem with block games but here it's worst. 

I never found that WW2 Strategic games work well with blocks anyway, mostly because of the Two-Front war makes for poor "multi-side" block orientation on the map.

Attacking is too difficult.

And did I say the map was too small? Perhaps blocks of "Europe engulfed" size would have helped the problem.. Mhhh... I might just reduce the counters graphics and try it on smaller blocks one of these days.

Rushed production, map too small. Gobs of rules questions, even after the update the designer is literally saying on these forums "Play it this way until I hear back from Columbia." Right and left hand do not know what they are doing. 

Have a feeling they rushed it to get out before GMT's Triumph and Tragedy hit shelves (As it was up on P500 when this was announced). Speaking of, check out that game instead, it does what ViE fails to do, which is to be a good strategic WWII block game.

Has potential to be a great game but rules need cleanup and a few quirks that seem very unrealistic but can probably be house ruled. May increase rating to 8 or 9 once revised rules are released and they address some early concerns.

I've really enjoyed this one. It's become my favorite Columbia game to date. My friend who introduced me to the game told me of some of the grumblings about it which sort of turned me off wanting to play it for a while. We did finally sit down and play the game and after the play I felt that those grumblings were completely out of proportion. We both felt that the game was excellent. The board was just fine and playable. Sure a bigger board would be great but it's just fine to play as is. There were a few rules clarifications we would like but I didn't really have major problems with the rules though the version I read was the recent revised rules so I don't really know what the original issues were or care quite frankly now that there is a revised version. 

The game got me thinking about it after we played and I wanted to play it again the next week which we did. It's always a good sign when a game gets you thinking about it after you play. 

For that epic WWII type game I would much prefer something like this to Axis and Allies. This is an excellent game.

RATING: 9
What do I like most about Victory in Europe?

1. Many strategic options
Players have multiple optional strategies and are not limited to a historical line of events. The Axis can attack France before Poland or invade England after the fall of France. The Allies can attack Italy in 1939, the Soviets can attack Germany first etc. etc. It is all up to the players to decide.

2. Light rules
For a game that covers the entire ETO the rules are very light, about 11 pages. The system is easy to learn within a couple of turns. We hardly consult the rules during play. This way, you can focus on game play instead of the rules. However, the rules are more complex than most other Columbia games, for example Hammer of the Scots or Julius Caesar. I can imagine that gamers unfamiliar with Columbia Games have more difficulty in getting to grip with the mechanics.

3. Many though choices
Although the rules are light, players are confronted with many hard choices: How to best spend your Command Points? Retreat or continue battle? Activate leaders yes or no? Which units to build? Although the rules are light, the game is by no means easy to play. It is difficult to foresee all the consequences of your choices. This can be frustrating, but it will also keep the game interesting and challenging.

4. Multiple scenario's
I am happy that multiple setups are included. You can start the war in 1939, 1941, 1942, 1943 and 1944. Each scenario has different challenges and if you don't have much time you can set up the 1943 or 1944 scenario.

5. The artwork
The map, units and cards are in my humble opinion quite nice. The map is clear. We do not have any issues with unclear borders, terrain or whatever. The units and cards have a good WWII-feeling. I do agree that the map is too small. I have printed a bigger map.

What I don't like? Most of all: the shore bombardment. This makes the Allied battleships as strong as a panzer army! We have houseruled this. Furthermore, the map is too small for the amount of blocks
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
ViE offers a fine narrative but I'm not sure the 1939 scenario is playable. The Axis can be easily repulsed, even by small neutrals like Belgium, and things bog down into a sitzkrieg. If combined with bad diplomacy rolls, there's not much the Axis player can do except call the game.  It's time to try the 1941 scenario...

I agree with others that the map is too small for all of the units, but it's by no means a game breaker. The Army placeholder markers worked well.  There are a number of rules ambiguities that need to be addressed in a future rules update. 

Nonetheless, I really do like ths game and ver. 2.0 rules may turn ViE into a classic.  If you like Europe Engulfed but don't have 20 hours to complete it, this game is for you.

If you want to play the WWII in 1 or 2 afternoons with numerous strategic choices and a very good historical feeling, this is your game.
We can try different options and the game is very tense and fun! Very good replayability!
Now when I want to play some parts of the war, I play the Eurofront serie and and when I want to play the whole thing I play Victory in Europe for ETO and Pacific Victory for PTO. The systems have numerous similarities.
I will upgrade to 10 with the V1.2 rules.

RATING: 4.5
Only one play and several re-readings of the rules.  I'm not going to rehash all the other comments but I agree with all the other criticism.  This was clearly rushed out - other Columbia games have clear rules with few ambiguities but this is such a mess. You can tell that someone with a very different style wrote these rules. But the gameplay, in general, is not a good simulation nor perhaps even a game.  For instance, you can conceivably move every unit every turn. As the Axis, I was unable to take either Poland or France.  Two rounds of combat (or retreat) and unrealistically restrictive border crossing limits shut down me Germans.  Over a dozen unit types is likely too many for this grand strategic scale.  For the cost, I am hoping this will turn out like Worthington's Hearts & Minds: Vietnam which is a really, really  great game buried in terrible rules and editing.  But that took a complete re-write of the rules so that even seasoned gamers could agree upon the intention of the rules.  Please CG, finish this game,  want to play!

While it's certainly not a good historical simulation, it is a great open-ended game where players can attempt a variety of different strategies. As such, many unhistorical events are possible but exploring these "what if?" situations is part of the appeal. It also adds to replayability. With the most recent rules, the game is not that complex, and two experienced players can easily play this in an evening.

RATING: 7
Overall, a great amount of depth and subtlety packed into a very playable game.  Poor editing and rules ambiguities have caused some initial bad press, but once these features are tightened up with errata the game will be very solid.  The board size is playable, but would have been better with a bigger board.  Components are beautiful.  A vast amount of replay-ability.  Initial reports have been mixed due to a perceived lack of play-balance.  From what I can tell, this is unfair and stems from newbie players who are not yet comfortable with the nuances of the Columbia blocks system.  Overall, this is my favorite strategic level WWII game when I don't have 30 to 60 hours to play Advanced Third Reich or Eurofront.  Since I never have time to play these games...well, this is my favorite strategic level WWII game.  The only reason I give it an 8.5 is due to the errata that must be read to properly understand the rules, and the small map.  When my custom enlarged map is finished, my version of the game will be a 9.0 rating.

Update:  So much promise, but this game ultimately suffers from some critical flaws.  The scale is such that the unit limits allowed to cross borders (along with too much limiting terrain) puts the attacker at an extreme disadvantage.  The original game design included 6 turns per year, but the folks at Columbia shrunk this number to four.  As a result, much of the historical campaign is difficult, if not impossible (or at least impractical)to mimic.  One of the oddities of the game, is that if you wish to mirror the historical campaign of the Germans, you need a bit of luck, and some cooperation from your opponent.   In my opinion, the historical success of the Germans should have been used as an "average" expected outcome, not an extraordinary success...after all, they still lost.  It is a fun game,but the scale of the game, along with the short 4 turn year created problems that broke the game.  Curiously, the expected 1941 Russian forcepool, readiness, and economy are much too strong in my opinion. Interestingly, some of the completely open-ended features of this grand strategy WWII game illustrate an interesting point: certain actions and foreknowledge by the allies probably would have ended the German's campaign much sooner.  Leading me to realize that sometimes structure and limits make a better game than pure historically unhindered freedom.  The last game I played I did manage to knock out France relatively early, and penetrated fairly deep into Russia with a two pronged powerful attack. Unfortunately, I lost, and my opponent told me later that he was never really concerned.  He had powerful Russian reserve forces waiting to finish me off once my underpowered German units broke through the lines.  If Ron can give us a few extended campaign play examples that illustrate how the Germans can consistently win, I would love to read them.

full disclosure: designer an acquaintance. the scale gives too much of birds-eye view of the war, and of course its rigged so that france and Poland have to fall in 1 turn (or else unwinnable as axis).
very good within the above constraints. much better than Europe engulfed, worse than eurofront and rated accordingly.

update: its not that much better than Europe engulfed- too much weird BS, like make a naval raid on Brussels to prevent units in no. france from retreating thru pending battle! air should pin air, naval should pin naval. and the Ge D2 units have a 1/6 chance to eliminate a navy unit?? are fortreeses army units ? (winter D1 fire?).
and I was wrong about it being rigged for france to fall in a turn, unfortunately.

Bought off FB Wargamer's Marketplae. Add it to The Fog of War and Triumph & Tragedy as higher-level ETO games in the pile of games to play. Of course, none can compare to A Mighty Struggle.

Noch keine definitive Wertung, weil zu viele Regeln unklar bleiben. Und der Spielplan ist eindeutig zu klein für die vielen Blöcke, die sich namentlich in Mitteleuropa aufhalten (müssen). Könnte ein hervorragendes Sandbox-Game werden, um z.B. durchzuspielen, was geschieht, wenn den Alliierten gelingt, den Balkan auf ihre Seite zu ziehen usw.
Wertung nachgetragen, inzwischen ist zumindest ein großer Teil der Regel-Fragen offiziell beantwortet.

Never got the block game Europe Engulfed to the table due to play length. This one looks much more likely to get some play and is a similar light weight.

Played a couple times. Relies on the old trope of 'roided up Germans to attempt the historical narrative. Economic system makes little sense (the Germans reach their maximum before Barbarossa). Some clever bits hidden in the hole-filled rules. T&T just does most things better at this scale, and in half the time.

[1 play] They tried to do too much and the ended up with something that has too many moving parts, will take days to complete, too many units, insufficient map size, and rules ambiguities. Subsequent rules might fix the latter, they won't correct the rest.

I rate this realistically and perhaps should have given it a 4, because I'm not going to want to play it again. It wasn't what I wanted and expected. We were led to believe that this was going to be like Liberty, Hammer of the Scots, or Napoleon for WWII. It seems more like Europe Engulfed played on territories not much bigger than postage stamps. And with a very large number of blocks, to play well and think about your potential moves and reinforcements for every single block on every single turn, the pace and upkeep is taxing.

This might be your game. 35 years ago on a long rainy weekend it might have been mine. Not anymore.

Most recent play March '15.

Update: February 2017 - Columbia has released revised rules v1.2

I think it is natural with complex games for companies like GMT, Columbia, Worthington, etc. to publish rules knowing that massive scale play out in the wild by hundreds of players will find errors and tweaks that require errata and perhaps 2.0 rules down the road. I'm ok with that, if the game delivered at the outset is fun and vastly playable. I'm not ok if, in essence, the initial offering is blocks and a map, expecting users to give enough feedback over time that they can release rules that make the best out of said blocks and map more than a full year later.

Perhaps there could be a good game here but it's buried in some horribly unclear rules. Or maybe it's not and there's just nothing here, I still can't tell. I gave it a 3 out of confused annoyance. I am dumbfounded by the people who give this game a 10 and claim it was "well play tested". How can you play test a game which was being changed even in the final weeks before production? The inconsistent and confusing rules show that lack of playtesting. The map is pretty though.

Bah, changed the 3 to a 2 and dumped this piece of drek. Nice components, pretty map, horrible rules that show complete contempt for the people who paid for this game. The publishers should be ashamed.

RATING: 8.5
This game is brilliant and so well-developed.  The more I have played the game the more I noticed how well-developed it seems. Even the map seems well thought-out and developed. I think it is incredible all that is modeled about this conflict in such an elegant way. I think it is a crowning achievement of the block genre. I think it *may* take several plays to learn how to play this game well, but I see more and more subtleties and more and more interesting decisions the more I do. Only playing it once or twice may lead to a snap judgment. The new rules are much clearer though.

10/24/15: dropping rating to 8.5 after two games with Seth.  Too many rules ambiguities and issues: bombarding offensive BB's? airborne not having stacking costs leads to not using them and putting them on defense e.g. in Berlin or Leningrad, can air units park in sea with no battle and then land at end of combat?  do border limits apply during non-combat movement (prob not).

Unfortunately, I found this game not ready for publication.
The rules are still not finished a year after release.
The map is too small for the number of blocks used.
I feel the scale was wrong for the mechanics.

It has potential, but has definitely not reached it.
I think it is neither the "killer app" nor the "next big thing" for the block game format.

With some minor house roll (added extra PP to Axis) this game has everything. Lot of possibilities deep tactic, true fog of war, every action every build point spent matter. 6 hours for the whole war with every nation and minor involved. Just a gem.

I have played once, but the rules were easy to follow, we just needed additional clarifications on terrains effect on units and land disembark.
I played Germans, and managed to get a minor Victory (which tasted like Glory), the dice rolls helped, but also the reinforcement tactic. I used in Paris a german infantry D1 with reinforcement cost 1, to take major casualties. :)

Will stay in shrink until the rules are revised or the Q&A document is heavily updated.  Confirmed rumors of a too-small map don't help.

Unfortunately, my copy (opened or not) will go into the trade pile if the campaign game routinely lasts 8-10 hours.  I was expecting a "long evening" game (as advertised on Kickstarter), not a weekend game - and I don't want to be stuck playing late-war scenarios to keep things short.* 

Sadly, [i]Victory in Europe[/i] may be my final Columbia purchase.  I appreciate the company's longevity, indie spirit, customer relations, historical expertise, and love of the hobby, but their ongoing looseness with rules editing and testing has worn me down.

As a WW2 alternative, [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/130960/triumph-and-tragedy]Triumph and Tragedy[/url] may be just what the doctor ordered. We'll see.

[size=7]*I reserve the right to reacquire the game in 20 years when I retire and have more free time.[/size]

Triumph and Tragedy is amazing, which means that ViE is now looking for a new home.  Any adopters out there?

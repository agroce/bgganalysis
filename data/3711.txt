Good game, if you can get past aircraft flying around their opponent and shooting them down after being attacked from behind!  That was a big problem for me.  Later aircraft don't have that problem, due to higher speeds and poorer turning.  i think the problem came from Avalon Hill's "update", which included early aircraft.

First air war boardgame that puts you in the pilot seat. I have not played any game that came with the 'stick' and trottle. 

Plenty of planes to choose from. Great game in it's day. Would want to bring it out once in awhile for a quick 30min game.

Easy and fast to learn. Fast also to play. Most times under one hour.
The more modern scenarios (specially the ones in the late 80) have a lot of EW involved, that decide the battle more than the maneuvering of the plane. Totally correct from a historical point of view! But the earlier scenarios are more fun to simulate. I prefer to play the '50 / '60 era. But a good description of Jet fights. 

Very good game.

5 if you play it double blind.  Good but abstract game of modern air combat.  Need good scenarios for good games.  Double blind involves two copies, separate rooms and a game master 'air controller'.   Really edge of your seat stuff then.   Of course, with computers this kind of gaming is obsolete.  Old mechanics make this dated.

Played a couple classic match-ups recently as my introduction to the system: Mig-15 vs. F-86 and MiG-17 vs. F-8. Maybe if I had picked this up and played it when I was in my 20's, I'd enjoy it more. As it is, I'm in my 50's and I've already played (and enjoy) Check Your Six: Jet Age. That game is much snappier and has campaign modules to give your sessions some needed context.

Most dogfight wargames require you to do some spatial problem-solving and solve math equations at the same time—in your head. Which is something you can't see on the board and only chart-laden player aids to help you. That can lead to mistakes and hard feelings as you take (or dodge) an attack in error. 

Flight Leader isn't as bad as some of these games can be. But it's enough—for me. The investment of my time doesn't yield a high enough return in fun.

Fairly simple sequential movement game on jet to jet combat from the Korean War to NOW...movement rates are low enough that one avoids the trading shots syndrome from the earlier Richthofen's War...fairly simple rules but somewhat difficult to digest given that they are written in the legalese which seemed to characterize rules for AH's games during this era.

One of the better air combat genre games, as it's not that complicated, plays quickly, yet nicely highlights the differences between plane types. Still not quite there, but one of the better tries.

I bought this one way back in the late '80s. Thought it was a bit complex and went on to play PC flight sims. Have come back to it now, the Basic Game rules at least aren't too bad of a read. Will try a few games before rating. Unfortunately some of the counters suffered from mildew from being in the basement on a cement floor.

This game was fantastic when I had to much time as a kid.  Interesting air to air combat simulator.  I will probably never play this type of game again.

Played this one many times. When playing gunfighters and simultaneous movement, this is a fun and fast game. Missiles and their associated rules made the game a little more difficult. Obviously PC games and PlayStation games on the subject are a lot more fun to play, but have never found an electronic flight sim that modelled as many different aircraft as this game did.

Gorgeously produced and based on the Air Force's Project Warrior CHECK SIX game.  But it just couldn't hold a candle to GDW's AIR SUPERIORITY and AIR STRIKE game system, even though the latter two games were a bit more complex and even though the former had scenarios covering the Korean and Vietnam Wars.  The game was certainly fun, but didn't feel realistic enough for me.  It was good to get new players into wargaming because the basic game was so easy.

Once THE SPEED OF HEAT came out by Clash of Arms using the GDW system, I never picked up this game again.

very good aerial dogfight game. It has terrific player aids and a very good "step by step" rulebook. 
The basic game is just that, basic. 
when you move to the advanced game you step into a very good balance between a game and a simulation. Not so "gamers friendly" than check your 6, it allows nevertheless a more broad situational approach because of the time span/dimension of hexes. Only pity, it hasn't rules regarding bomber's raids. 
It deserves better press... and a modern revamping.

I call this Foxbat/Phantom done right with a dash of Richtofen's War feel. Nice looking map and package, playable game system, decent fun factor. No appeal to me though due to lack of differentiation among aircraft.  Wrong scale I thought and overly simplistic combat system. Got more respect when played using the impulse move option, but this slowed games down quite a bit. If you thought Air Superiority was too complex, this might suite you better. Some Air Sup fans used this to draw in prospective air gamers since it was a simpler game to play, then got them to switch over to Air Superiority if they had enough interest.

I'm a sucker for any air combat game.  This is the one that I would recommend to someone with a interest in Modern (up to 90's) warfare.  The counters are a bit busy but make the play a little easier.  The board is the best thing on the market with few exceptions.  Just don't try to fly a F-8e Crusader against a SA-37 Viggen like I tried to do.  That thing is flying dynamite in the game.

Granted, I was only about 12 or so when I got this game, so I'm going largely on the recollection of someone who was taking geometry and still thinking he could play in the NBA someday.  Nonetheless, my chances of dunking were rather similar to my chances of following the advanced rules.  It was kind of cool to see how quickly I could take out a 1912 plane with a modern fighter...it was also kind of cool to make farting noises with my armpit, drop my books on the floor (along with classmates) exactly at 2:15 for a substitute teacher, and stick Star Wars figures in the microwave.  I probably wouldn't want to continue any of these pursuits currently.

RATING: 8
Modern jet fighter dogfighting in close formation encounters.  The game is simple in mechancis and yet realistic, unlike the "shallow" feeling of the dogfight card games (e.g. Wings of War).  Key elements of the air movement, combat capabilities and fighting diciplines are featured.  One very cool thing is the covering of ALL jetfighters in the real world aircraft arsenal.  You can virtually fly every aircraft pitting against different opposing forces at anytime and in any scenarios.  The earlier game of this was published as Check Six (Close Simulations), whereas Tac Air was derived from FEBA (also by Close Simultions).  The game focuses on the pre-engagement manouvering a lot and the actual dogfighting is de-emphasised.  A cool box cover and superb physical component (yes, it still has the mounted mapboard). A must buy for the air combat grognards.

RATING: 8
My first wargame! - and first boardgame too. It's still great fun, as long as you use the impulse rules, and a bit of tweaking. 

Flight Leader focuses on managing the fight, rather than the actual flying and performance details. As a consequence, the energy and maneuverability modeling is somewhat coarse - and don't get me started on the fidelity of the 3D geometry. 

Weapons are likewise somewhat simplistically modeled: Modifiers don't seem right, latest generation missiles like AMRAAM seem wrong and the guns system is somewhat rudimentary. 

So on paper, for would be jet jockeys, it shouldn't be all that much. But FL has that one thing that makes up for the rest of it: Playable impulse movement. And the game does keep its focus nicely. 

The final verdict: A game that still has a special place in my collection. And with some tweaking and additions, it can be made to perform much closer to real life, with greater detail in the maneuvering - and possibly still keeping complexity down

My rating reflects the combination of house rules with 12 degrees of heading and variant rules from The General. With just the game itself, including impulse movement, it would be around a 6.5

An instant classic favorite. I cannot get enough of this game. It is the perfect mix of crunchy and playable, everything I wanted in an air war game. The rules themselves are excellent in the fact that you can make it as light or heavy as you want. You feel like you are flying the aircraft. The huge mix and amount of aircraft is perfect for gear/rivet heads like myself.

Highly recommend not bothering with the play mats and using the writing pad provided. So much easier than all those counters for each aircraft.

Want to know how much I love it? I am in the process of adding 1/600 minis to the game. You can see my progress here:

I know that Flight Leader has never been hugely popular, but I like it. It has a good representation of the key energy mechanic, it is not overly complex, but cater for the critical aspects of air to air combat. It is a shame that it has no air to ground missions (this is the reason why I like the Speed of Heat more). Yet even with that omission it is still a solid and effective representation of air combat in the jet age. i am also skeptical of the people who said that air combat requires a computer, they confuse combat simulations with flight simulators...

Highlights: energy managements, representation of vision arcs and crew training, lack of record sheets (instead the game uses control panels), variety of planes.

As I've said in a number of other games, I'm an aviation nut.  As such, I had to get this game.  It is a pretty decent attempt to cover Air Combat from the Korean War to the modern (at the time) era.  The basic rules are pretty simple to follow and the advanced rules aren't much more complex.  The weapons seem too deadly though.

Nowhere near as good as another contemporary game, GDW's "Air Superiority".  

"Flight Leader" is a fast playing game, but didn't like the somewhat abstracted missile combat mechanics and 3D movement rules compared to "Air Superiority", which I thought much better captured the feel of ACM and the deadly technology of modern air combat.

As with all air combat board games, you can go for simplistic, which fails (normally by leaving out altitude), to complex, which feels more like driving tractors round a field than flying. This game is a hybrid between the two, giving a reasonable flight system (you set the throttle and joystick positions, then work out where you will end up and your final speed and altitude) but making the aircraft fairly generic. Advanced rules slow the game down, perhaps too much to keep interest. To be honest, a decent flight sim will immerse you better in the subject.

RATING: 6.5
Not a bad game at all, the rules are fairly simple, good compromise between playability and chrome and it covers an interesting period, early jets combat to the eighties.

The mounted map is one of the prettiest I have ever seen. Definitely a work of art.

I feel the game is a bit broken though because the way I see it, it can only really work with simultaneous movements which are in the optional rules with the impulse movements but then it becomes impossible to keep track of more than a handful of jets.

I picked up a copy of this game a long time back when I was looking for something along the lines of modern day Air Force & Dauntless.  Unfortunately I never really had a chance to get much into it though.  I think I may have lost most of it in the move when I graduated from college.

Really a very poor model of air combat, though it has the virtue of simplicity to draw in gamers who otherwise find air games difficult to handle. It is very fast-playing for folks with very short attention spans. And for those that like that sort of thing it has lots and LOTS of aeroplanes. The basic game suffers Richthofen's War syndrome in which aircraft take turns circling each other and shooting each other down. The Advanced game suffers from impulse movement, which makes the gameplay as joyful as having one's teeth pulled. The movement system breaks down while trying to fly with impulses. This game is really for the beginner and not the air combat aficionado, though it's light on the modelling even for the beginner.

This was the first wargame I owned--way back in 1986! I picked up an eBay copy for nostalgia, but it's still fun after all those years. The basic game can be played easily right out of the box with just four pages of rules. Manage speed, altitude, fuel, guns, and heat-seeking AAMs while maneuvering to get a shot at your opponent. More advanced rules--radar locks, ECM, and so on come later. Would be much more intuitive with good aircraft cards. Offers something different from Check Your 6! Jet Age and will be an occasional alternative. I may someday try to optional impulse movement system.

I almost always preferred AH's take on a subject vice SPI's, but I have to say that Flight leader suffers massively in comparison to Air War.  Flight Leader was just far too abstract for me after playing many many games of Air War.

TSR releases an air wargame right at the height of Top Gun's popularity.  Not too sure how this worked.  It's been a while since I played this, but I remember it being OK although translating tactical air combat to cardboard has always been problematic.

The mechanics are not as heavy as they could be, but they are definitely there. The basic version of the game is very easy to learn and is not complicated at all, but still very involved in its need to keep track of many counters. The game was originally designed by a fighter pilot Captain for USAF training in flight leadership.

Back in the 1980s I was very into contemporary air combat and this game promised much. Actually I only played the basic game because the advanced rules looked too complicated and I was not interested in spotting rules, radar lockons on so on, I just wanted to turn and shoot just like in WW1. Now I understand these are fundamental aspects of modern air combat and, 30 years later, this game is back on my table. Maybe now I am ready to delve into the pilot's manual...

As for simulation Flight Leader has questionable "flight engine", turns are long and maneuvering is simple. I wouldn't like to believe that rules reflect reality. 

On the other hand, if taken as entertainment, it is all right for couple of games but soon becomes rather boring.

Of all the air combat games I've tried to date, Flight Leader is the best mix of realism and playability. Games play fast, and using chits to track plane status is much nicer than complicated hand-written log sheets. The only downside is a personal preference, that I prefer WWII era prop-driven planes over modern(ish) day jet fighters. Still, the system is clean and enjoyable, and not over-encumbered by rules.

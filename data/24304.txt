RATING: 6
A clever but not entirely remarkable word game. The illustrations were amusing in a Munchkin-esque way, and I thought the use of the angles for each letter relating to the score was a nice Lovecraftian touch. I think that if I play again I'd like to play with the variant where you can spell out nonsense words if you're near insanity so long as you make a check against it to add to the humour.

Quick word game with a Cthulhu theme.
Fun part is when you only have one live left and go insane, you can start to invent words if you want.
I prefer to get an explanation about what these made up words mean, which makes the game more fun.

RATING: 4
First of all, bear in mind that this IS a word game: nothing more, nothing less! And as far as a word game can be well-themed, this is a well-themed spoof of all things Cthulhuish, and it's hilarious for anyone who has read the Lovecraft corpus (corpse?) and doesn't need to take it seriously. The tentacles of Cthulhu (or one of his sidekicks) holding a hand of cards on the front cover is funny enough; but then on the back cover you have a group of the Old Ones, when they were the Young Ones (including one wearing a beanie), being taught Lovecraftian English by a kindly old school marmster. The little Cthulhu figurines are reminiscent of the seven dwarfs, but it's the art on the cards themselves, that's the best. Each letter is for an unspeakable blasphemy against God and nature that should never be spoken.....and something else, too! "U is for Ubb": but if you look closely, the Ubb in question is holding an umbrella! "N is for Nyarlathotep", who happens to be wearing a necktie! And my favourite? Well, almost twenty years ago, I was deep into a game of Call of Cthulhu when, after a couple of hours pursuit, I met an eldritch fate when my pursuer, a byakhee (a hideous flying monster with a fondness for human flesh) finally got me, and, well, it was unspeakable. "B is for byakhee"; and pretty butterfly, too! Not well themed?! What other word game could possibly justify a sanity check???!
So why have I given Unspeakable Words a mere 4? As funny as it is, the joke wears off pretty quickly, and you're left with a fairly standard word game. You do have the unusual feature of danger if your words are too long and have too many angles, but it seems a little too easy to me to avoid insanity with the number of Cthulhus you start out with, and the various optional rules. So it's a nice lark, but not a long-lived one.

Game mechanics are fine, and the game itself is fun.  Where this game fails is in the horrible quality of the components.  The Cthulhu sanity markers give off a horrendous smell, so bad that we just use dice to keep track of our sanity when playing.  Also, the quality of the card stock is terrible.  The cards start to bend ON THEIR OWN, without any real play at all.  The game isn't expensive, so I don't guess I can complain too much, but it still feels like the company cheaped out.

Make up words with cards.  Cards have points value.  Then roll a d20.  If the d20 is lower than your word score you don't score.  Ok, reduce the chances of losing your word by playing low scoring words.  That's all the tactics there are.  Weird themeing.  Who is the game aimed at?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A simple game where the players have to form words out of a hand of cards.  The cards have both a letter and a point value assigned to them.

The tricky part is that the highest scoring words have the best chance of leading you down the path of "insanity".  Players who go insane automatically lose.

OF course you can't just sit back and score low value words all game since it's a race to 100 points, so players constantly have to balance between staying ahead in point values versus risking a trip to the loony bin.

Plays fast, decent little filler.  Cool little Cthulu tokens.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
An interesting word game, but way too luck dependent.  I really wish there were a (better) way to regain sanity.  There is an optional rule for discarding and rolling higher than your discard value, but on average your discard value is going to be higher than 18 and very difficult to roll over with a 20 sided dice.

I also considered rolling the sanity check on 3d6.

6/22/07 - Played once and enjoyed it.  I have no background in Cthulhu Mythos and really couldn't even tell you what it is.  Fun game that forces you to spell shorter words in order to keep your sanity in check.  The more valuable the word, the more likely you'll lose some sanity.   Neat balance with great bits and art on the cards.

I thought this would be a change of pace from traditional word games (which I hate.)  It is not.  In fact it's not even interesting.  There appears to be nothing new in this game, and the theme is so non-existent they might as well not have bothered.  The game seems to almost entirely hinge on the die-rolls, because you can play it safe and play a low point word and still lose sanity.

A word game I actually like: who knew? The theme got me into this, but it has turned out to be great for pickup games and conventions: you can explain it quickly, and everyone pretty much gets it instantly. The luck factor is probably too much for some people, but I think it works. And the game is short enough that player elimination (which isn't likely until over half-way through the game anyway) isn't a huge problem.

RATING: 7
A fairly silly game that favors small politically incorrect words. The game is less about vocabulary and spelling skills than it is about silliness and fun. For those of us that are not scrabble proficient its a great word game alternative. At about 30 minutes to play its about just right for what it is.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A very entertaining word game peppered with references to H.P. Lovecraft's (and his successors') Cthulhu Mythos. The idea is that you have a hand of seven cards, each representing a letter of the alphabet, and you have to make a word using as many letters as you like. You then roll a 20-sided die against the point value of your word, and if you roll too low, you lose one of your five "sanity tokens", and if you lose all five you lose the game.
Easily the best part of this game is the impressive quality of the sanity tokens themselves: each is a small, green, 3d-molded Cthulhu figurine. These are a nice extra where other games might have just had simple plastic circles or some such.
Each card also has a whimsical cartoon of a Mythos creature, and has something like "(letter) is for (creature name)" on the bottom, amusingly making this seem like some kind of really bizarre children's book. My personal favourite is "H is for __________" with a picture of the King in Yellow. Quite clever.
The only real drawback is that the point value of each letter is based on the number of angles in the letter. This means there's some really weird stuff going on here like J not being worth any points and a letter like A being worth 3.
Anyway, a pretty entertaining casual game.

RATING: 8
Think Scrabble with a Cthulhu theme. Players are dealt 7 cards and 5 sanity tokens. Sanity tokens are shaped like purple Cthulhus. A card has a letter and illustration printed on it. Point values of the cards are based on the number of angles in a letter, ex: H is worth 4, C is worth 0, T is worth 2 etc.... So if you spell "HOT" it is worth 6 points. After spelling a word you must roll a d20. The roll must equal or exceed the point value of your word or you lose a sanity token. If you lose all 5 sanity tokens you are out of the game. 

The game plays fast and is lighthearted. The theme is light. If you like the Cthulhu mythos you'll appreciate the artwork. Nice filler. Has several optional rules that add a bit of Cthulhu flavor to the game.

Quite good fun for a filler. And the Cthulhus are so cute! Play with a house rule allowing Mythos names and another one giving double points for spelling them (might limit this to the names on the cards so that non-Mythos freaks are not left scratching their heads).

What's up with this game? It's totally bizzare. Firstly, the Cthulhu theme is a total paste-up job. Cthulhu isn't even a valid word to play here, nor is any other name from the Cthulhu mythos (it's standard Scrabble words only). At least in Simpsons Scrabble they had the sense to make classic Simpsons words and names valid. Secondly, the point scoring is totally random. It's based on the number of angles in the letter, not difficulty of play or anything, so playing the versatile and common A (at 4 points) is worth exactly the same as the specialized and rare X (4 points), while the surprisngly tricky U is worth nothing, zero, zilch, and a Q is worth a whopping 2. A standard word game in which an A is worth twice as much as a Q has a problem. It boggles the mind.This is a game to play for the Cthulhu art, although the art is not particularly inspiring (although the Cthulhu tokens are cool). Sort of like Coportate Shuffle made the awful The Great Dalmuti palatable by having funny cartoons on the cards. Ernest and Selinker should have their designers guild cards revoked.

It's a basic spell words and score game, with some added chaos.  Basically the better the word you make, the higher the chance you have of losing sanity points.  Lose sanity points and you're out.  It's the sort of game that you buy for the theme and cards, which are pretty humorous.  Doesn't replace BuyWord as my favorite wordgame, but I do like the cards.

This game is a great choice for a word game that can be played competitively by people who have less-than-stellar vocabularies.  It will earn bonus points from those who like Lovecraft/Cthulhu themes.

My kids and I have played and enjoyed this many times.  We play it as a narrative -- each time you play a word, you use that word to advance a spooky story.  (E.g., "I turned slowly, and my eyes widened when I saw that my DOG was being transformed into a hideous beast.")

RATING: 3
"So, let me get this straight," I said to Larry, "we're playing a word game themed to the Cthulhu mythos where I lose my sanity when I use big words." "Yep," he replied. And so we played it, and I'm still in awe of the fact that someone actually came up with the idea of this game. I honestly cannot conceive of a more unholy pairing than this. Not since midgets, crucifixes, and porn have come together has a more strange concept been unleashed on the world.

Players have a hand of seven cards with a letter on each of them. They also start with a small herd of Cthulhu minis. On their turn, they lay a word out of their hand, score the points shown, and roll a D20 with the hopes of rolling equal to or greater than the value of the word they just played. Rolling lower costs you one of the darling Cthulu pieces, and losing all of your Cthulhu pieces puts you out of the game. The goal is to get to 100, or to be the last one with minis. That is it.

The game has a sort of interesting concept in that playing medium value words, in theory, is safer because you are more likely to keep your mind. This is counter-balanced by the desire to just lay out huge words, score a tonne of points for them, sanity be damned. Dice rolling skills are useful here though, I laid nothing of higher than 12 value, and most of my words were below 10, yet I lost my sanity in 5 straight turns. So it goes.

I appreciate the effort to make a more accessible word type game, though again, I stand in awe of the amount of crack that must have been smoked when this idea was originally conceived, but I personally do not care for this type of game all that much. Scrabble did it best years ago, and in terms of social, word based games I still think Kramer's Haste Worte is the clear winner, though again, I'm not a big, big fan of that either. This game also runs a bit on the long side for what it is.

A very simple and silly card game with cute art. You have to use variant 1: The Unspellable Oath. We also allowed the names of Cthulhu Mythos nasties to be spelled as a house rule. I got "BAST" and "YIG" in my first game. I was one freakin letter away from getting "NYOGTHA"! We also considered allowing French words since they love Lovecraft so much over there.

This game gets lots of bonus points for the cool little Cthulhu figures. You get 30 of the bloody things in the game! I almost want to get another set so I can set the little buggers up on my desk at work. Let me co-workers check those little blasphemous fellows out and go mad with envy (or fright)! 

Rating is 5 for the game with a 2 point bonus for the Cthulhu figures!

I love word games. I'm really good at those but there are too problems. Being a writer, most of my Greek friends hate playing me in Scrabble, for instance, while I tend to lose my edge when I am playing against english speaking folks.

It's Scrabble meeting Zombie Dice and it's amazing and of course there is nothing more fun than losing your sanity and spelling every stupid thing that comes in mind. Deeply underrated game.

A word game for people who don't like word games.  Or words.  Or games.  There's a reason Scrabble has letter frequency and value keyed to their frequency in the English alphabet, and not only does this game toss that out, it doubles down with a moronic mechanic where after a while it makes sense to only play dinky two-letter words and hope your opponent goes bust on dice rolls.  Thrill as "DO" and "ON" hit the table again and again!

I am not a fan of word games, but this is a good one! (Hint:  It's not really a word game.   It's a push-your-luck game.)  It's fast and painless.  Mixes a little bit of Boggle/Scrabble with a push-your-luck element since you have to roll above your word total or lose a miniature Cthulhu.  The bizarre Cthulhu flavor (can't really call it 'theme') and total overproduction give it some extra charm.

Some variations are included with the basic game which add favorably to the game.  We like 2 of the 4 variations which we combine.  One is if you discard your hand (which allows you to gain points), if your opponent can make a word from the discards it acts as a bonus turn for him.  The second variation allows you to gain back a dead Cthulhu pawn.  The most outstanding thing about this game are the Cthulhu pawns.  It is also quick and easy.  A decent filler game.

The plastic Cthulhu's give it an extra point-but I don't think this is more than a "we haven't played that in awhile, let's have a go" sort of game.  The card art is not very good.  If they were going for light hearted art, they should have referneced Munchkin Cthulhu.  If they were going for gothic horror, they missed it by a mile. In attmepting to stradle Cute & Fun with scary and menacing it simply looks sad, like somebody's cousin or girlfriend got the job to do the art if you know what I mean.

What a classic theme for a word game! It's very clever how the easy vowels are worth big points, forcing you to make big point words when you may not want to. It's exciting and agonising to go insane on 99 or 100 points.

I've increased my rating to a 9 because this is a very accessible word game that anyone can play, yet there is still skill involved. I just enjoy playing it.

RATING: 5
An interesting word game themed around the lore of H.P. Lovecraft.  The idea of the angles in words providing points seems odd at first, and also immediately unbalancing because some very common letters are worth a lot of points.  The catch here is that sometimes high scoring words are better avoided than played.  The neat mechanic added that one must make a sanity check for each word adds a little risk management to the game.  The tension grows from a fairly unspectacular beginning game.  Unspeakable Words blossoms when the scores for words become more detrimental to your possibility to win or lose your mind.  The Cthulu pawns are wonderful.

A fun word game with a cthulhu spin. Use the letter cards to build words, score the words by the angles in each letter. I'm glad they have the number score for each letter printed ont he cards because I have a heck of a time remembering them. Once you score your word, roll a d20 and meet/beat your score or go insane and lose a cthulhu figure of which you start with 5. Run out of cthulhu-ettes and you are out of the game.

RATING: 7
This game is absurd.  I love it.  I love the fact that letters are worth points depending on the number of angles in it and not because of how hard or easy it is to use the letter in a word but because it's thematic.

I love that when you have one life point you go insane and can make any combination of letters and call it a word.

I love that you can get eliminated and still win after everyone else is eliminated if you had the highest score.

I love that it's really not a very good word game and also doesn't take the Cthulhu aspect too serious.

And I really like the original art.  I hate the "deluxe" edition art and frankly, the deluxe edition is over produced.  

But the original feels just right for what it is: a ridiculous word game that isn't even pretending to make any sense.  It's like the opposite of scrabble.

Push your luck word game.  It's a good weapon in the word game arsenal, but I'm concerned that the theming is going to keep it from a wider audience.

A not-awful night-ender/filler if played fast, loose and goofy.  And only every once in a while.  Seems overarchingly dominated by luck at first (with all the die rolls) but there are definite strategies for racking up points while remaining sane long enough to cross the 100-point finish line.  Because the game could still come down to nothing more than Lady Luck's fickle bon-bon-eating hand wave and outstay its welcome it's best to attack this like a 10 minute party game.  Anything more than that will come off like a legless zombie—it will stink and drag.

Options that help tremendously:

- Allow all words that appear in the Mythos, even (especially?) the proper nouns.

- Allow the nearly insane (those with a single sanity point left) to spell anything at all, including single letters and gibberish.  As long as they shout it at the top of their lungs as they play it.

- Don't be a "Scrabble Dictionary only" stickler.  As we're fond of saying around here, "It ain't that kind of movie, Starbuck."  We allowed slang, comic book sound effects, the word [i]caca[/i] and even known misspellings if they resulted in comic effect (intended or not).  Does it break the game?  Hardly.  It [i]is[/i] the game.

RATING: 6
First played July 18th, 2007.  It's a quick learn (<5 min) and quick play (~30 min).  It seemed to drag on a bit at the end for me.  It had the illusion that we'd all be going out since if you don't roll high enough you loose one of your five protective animals.  The first to reach 100 and succed with a roll higher than the total of angles on the card letters wins.  If no one reaches, the last person remaining in, wins.  It's not a bad fun party type game.  Oh, and you can't reuse any words, which didn't come up for us anyway.  It does have some strategy in it, however it seems that lady luck holds most of the cards.

The theme is the thing here.  Create a word and then make a saving throw or lose sanity.  What's not to like?  Unlike most letter-based word games, the rarity of the letter does not determine how much the letter scores.  It adds an interesting twist, because it's often advantageous to form lower scoring words to increase your chances of making your sanity check.

RATING: 9
When played with fans of language, can be a real enjoyable game. We tend to use many of the rules variations, especially "The Unspellable Oath" which lets a player with only a single Cthulhu pawn left use any/all letters in his/her had to form/score a word - regardless of whether or not the word is real. Insanity has benefits! We've also instituted a rule of our own called the "Cthulhu Rule." If a player can form the word Cthulhu, and make their sanity check, they win the game. If they fail their sanity check, they lose all but one of their remaining Cthulhu pawns. It doesn't happen a lot, but it is fun when it does.

Massively lazy and disappointing, given that Ernest has already made a great word-card game in Escape from Elba. Build words from your hands, then roll over their score on a d20 to avoid losing one of five lives. Aside from a handful of simple variant rules, that's it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
One play, with non-gamers.  We had fun.  We sort of made it a rule to tell a fractured cthulhu tale as we played our words.  This added some fun.  We used the optional rule where any assortment of letters is permissible once you're down to a single sanity point.  This was also fun.  We all observed the need to gibber mindlessly when we went insane.  That was fun too!

Gamer's will likely dislike this game.  But give it a chance if you like the Cthulhu Mythos, word games or gaming with RPGers.

A simple card-based word game where players race to 100 points while also trying to remain sane.  After scoring for a word, the player must roll higher than the word's value or they lose 1 of their 5 "my pal Cthulhu" miniatures that represent their sanity.  Very simple, but lots of fun!

Cards with letters are dealt.  On your turn, make a word.  Words are scored my the number of angles in each letter.  Roll a die and see if you can beat that number.

A little plastic Cthulhu toy is dished out like a life point.

What a joke.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Hey, it's not Scrabble!  Letter values are based on the number of Angles in the Letter.  So an 'A' is worth five points, an 'E' worth 4 points and an 'O' or 'U' zero points.  Small words can add up to big points.  But there's the rub!  You have to roll equal to or better than the word score to avoid losing one of your five sanity tokens.  Play high scoring words and risk your sanity or take the small, slow and steady approach?  Recommend using optional rule #1 (Unspellable Oath) and the optional rule where everyone else gets a final play after one player scores 100 or more points.  (Also recommend a "house rule" that allows Cthulhu names as valid words.)
A Fun word game with a Cthulhu twist.

A bit overproduced with all the green cthulhu figurines but I suppose it oozes theme.  Its basically a word card game with chaos added as you do risk vs reward assessment/play the odds.  The catch is that you must roll on a 20 sided die a number that is higher than the total value of your word.  Fail to do so and you lose one of your cute green cthulhu.  Lose all 5 and you lose the game.  First player to 100 wins the game OR the last one left standing with cthulhu wins.  One other catch, a word can only be spelled once in a game, after that, its unspeakable!  Definitely a nice twist to a word game that may be more friendly to the less stellar spellers than other word games.

A very unexpected hit with my co-workers. It's different from scrabble because it's not always the person who makes the best words that will win. You have to think about the score you will get before you play the word. Then roll the D20 and hope you don't go insane.

Quick play and a quirky theme. I especially like that the little Cthulhus drive you insane if you fail too many rolls on a d20. 

Speaking of the d20, did I mention randomness? There is no strategy, but the theme keeps the game somewhat interesting. Unfortunately the theme is not enough to deal with the bigger problem - we don't play many word games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A devilish little word game - part inspired equal part irritating.

Put simply I don't like Scrabble.  Firstly, I am not very good at it, having a limited vocabulary, which seems to diminish every day, I therefore always start with a disadvantage.  Secondly, because of my ignorance games only have two outcomes the game either suffers from a runaway leader (and my foolishness is there on the board for all to see) or we all sit down wallowing in our own stupidity (neither are very nice experiences).  Thirdly, strategy is only available for the good players there is little you can do (except spoil) when you can only muster the words Cat, Dog or Spam.  Scrabble is undeniably a great game but it is exclusive and has put me off word games for a long time.

I do however like Unspeakable Words (though it does contain some big scary flaws) and it has got me back into word games.  The players with the greater vocabulary and strategy will win the majority of games (it rewards good play and word knowledge) but it is inclusive as even the players with a limited vocabulary can challenge for the lead - for once Cat, Dog and Spam maybe a path to victory.  The sanity dice (the longer the word the greater the chance of going insane but also the quickest route to victory) and the five lives are great modifiers and keep everyone with a chance of a win.  There is elimination but the game is quick and there is not too long a wait for another chance.  The points scoring is wonderfully eccentric (I suspect there maybe some hidden genius behind the system but that is not the point), the artwork is fantastic - though the theme is guilty of being pasted on - and the cthulu life markers are great.

In summary I think it is a word game which though will not please the purists and with a few bad dice rolls has the potential to anger even its greatest fan but if you learn to stop worrying and learn to love the dice then it will provide a fun 10 minutes compared to the harsh cold sterility of Scrabble.

Unspeakable Turds. This is a terrible game. However, the little plastic Cthulhus are wonderful. I understand how the more common letters score higher, thus making you more likely to lose sanity, but it just doesn't work. In a word game, you *must* reward players for using the difficult letters.

Scrabble meets random luck, meets push your luck, meets chaos, and is transformed into a fun party game.  With the right group, this simple card game is a lot of fun.  The only criticism is that with introvert players I could see this becoming more of an introvert game, where everyone focuses more on one's own words/world and loses the fun interactive aspect of the game.  However, with the right crowd it is a ton of fun, and now that I know this game for me it will always be preferred to its more serious cousin Scrabble and similar word games.  A little bit of roleplaying and humor as the sanity slips away and the gibberish begins is natural and fun.

Strange as it sounds, this is the best learning game I've found for my five year old. We help point out possible words she can make with her cards and then she spells them out and adds the values herself. She also loves that simple words can win because of the sanity rolls. We use the optional rule that with one sanity left you can spell anything you want and she adores making up words and telling us what they mean. It's also fun for my wife and I.

If you like word games you'll probably enjoy this.  If you don't, you won't.

I like word games.  This adds a neat push-your-luck element.  The one downside is that the recordkeeping can be tedious--one player will spend most of his time maintaining a scoresheet and list of words.  Play a couple of rounds and trade off scorekeeping duties, is my advice.

My fiancee once referred to the Cthulhu figurines as "snot goblins."  We don't call them anything else now.

Doesn't hit the table very often because the rest of my group isn't really into word games.

A very silly beer n' pretzel game.  It's not unlike Quiddler, but fixes some of the flaws.  The biggest improvement is adding some risk for big point words.  A simple game with few components, but the presentation is nice.

Ok, so it's a word game, and those don't exactly excite me. Still, there is something sort of amusing about the cute purple cthulu counters, the child-like art depicting various mythos monsters ("A is for Azathoth!"), and the sanity check after every word formed. I think playing with the optional rule that players on one sanity are allowed to make words using all the cards in their hands, and risk the sanity check is quite brilliant too. Sort of a push-you-luck layer ratcheted on top. So, I don't see myself playing this all the time, but every once in a while as a filler, I would be happy for it to hit the table.

This is a very simple word scoring game.  Each letter is scored based on the number of angles within the letter.  The longer the word with greater-angled letters will get you to the target 100 total quicker.

However, after each turn you have to roll a 20 sided dice equal to or above your score.  If you fail you lose a cthulhu idol.  You start the game with 5 and when you lost the last one, you're out.  Great for a 2 player game as this aspect really controls how risky you feel you should be as it is easy to go insame (losing all your cthulhu idols) just before you make 100 points.

The cards are designed nicely and whilst it comes in a large box, by virtue of it being a card game with a dice and 30 idols, it is the perfect travel game.

Fun, simple and educational for all the family.

An every so often request from the more classic board game part of my family. Even kids can play since the words don't have to be big or complicated. It is scored by the angles in the letters and the larger the word, the more chance you have of going insane.

A very simple push your luck game about forming words. The dice rolling is the most important par of the game, by far, but it's the last interesting. Almost no place for strategy.

The theme is totally artificial. Nothing is related to Cthulhu (the Cthulhu figures are very cool; the cards are not).

It would not work on Spanish, because of the different letter frecuency.

A twist on the typical card-word game, with awfully cute green demons.  I think this word game is playable and enjoyable even by people who normally don't like word games.  Making larger words is discouraged by the die rolling, so the smarties have more difficulty running away with the game.  Several variants included in the rules are also worth trying.

Okay... what's wrong with this game to deserve a 4, after all its just a boggle/scrabble variant with Cthulu monsters, that sounds like fun. The answer is the bane of all board games, this is Snakes and Ladders with theme. As a D20 is used it is obvious to anyone with even the most basic knowledge of probability that it makes not the blindest bit of difference if you play a 10 or 15 point word in terms of your chances of winning. You might as well all just roll a die, highest wins.

Having said that you can solve this fairly simply by rolling dice with a better distribution, such as 2D10 or 3D8.

This one rang more true with my non-gamer family, who are all a bit into word games like scrabble. A hit with my young cousins because of it's casual and fun gameplay additionally I get a kick out of the theming because it feels like secretly I've convinced them to play a thematic game. I play with a variant where if multiple games are played in the same night I, as score keeper, track words from all previous games and if they are repeated in any game I instantly drain a sanity from the forgetting party. It gives me a bit of a meta game and brings my enjoyment to the next level and I think my family enjoys it too because it prevents easy escape words like "Qi" and Greek letter "Xi" from getting used all the time to cull Q's and X's so it gets everyone thinking and increases variety. plus it's hilarious for me to ball someone out on using a word from 4 games ago and instantly cause them to lose a life point it is uproarious and everyone around the table gets a bit of a kick out of it, especially if its for the kill.

This is a word card game with a Call of Cthulhu theme.  Words constructed with letters with several angles such as A and R are worth more points while letters with no angles such as O, S, and C are worth no additional points.   However, a player must make a sanity check by rolling a D20 after each word, making the higher-point words essentially more dangerous.

It is hard to argue with lots of cute little Cthulu tokens.  On the flip side, word games in which using a Q earns fewer points than earning a I are mildly annoying.  The only redeeming feature is that scoring high is not always the sanest choice.

If Scrabble gets too heated, definitely give this game a shot.  It is not nearly as crafty or strategic, but it is quick and fun and doesn't punish people for the inability to exhaust every letter in their hand on every word.  I also am a sucker for horror themed games, even if it's mostly just a funny veneer.

RATING: 5
More of a party game, but at least it doesn't require a crazy huge vocabulary like Scrabble.  There is some luck in it, as the rolling of the dice to determine whether or not you go insane does play a significant role.

UPDATE: Upon further review, can't really say that I would look forward to playing this, although it wasn't all that bad.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Quite a nice little filler card-game, where you make words for points using letters from your hand of cards.  The twist is that you must also roll equal to or more than the points on a D20 - otherwise your lose a sanity token.  You only have 5 sanity tokens, and if you lose them all you're out of the game!  So there's a tradeoff between scoring with high points words and not failing the die roll.  First to 100 points wins.

The game is themed as relating to the Cthulhu mythos of HP Lovecraft, but there are only 3 HPL aspects pasted on: - (1) the cards have Cthulhu mythos characters/monsters on them, (2) the sanity tokens are (admittedly very cool) tiny plastic Cthulhu miniatures [I suspect many raters on BGG have increased the game's score because of these, and some even admit it ...], and (3) the points for each letter are taken from the number of angles in the letter [if you recall, the architecture of R'lyeh was described in terms of structures displaying non-Euclidean geometry.].  I was hoping for the game to at least have a role for 'unspeakable words' (in the title), but that only crops up incidentally in one of the optional rules.

So it's an OK family light word-card game, and keen Scrabble players may well like it, but Cthulhu fans (like myself) and others may be somewhat underwhelmed.  I found it rather dull, and even my wife - who is a Scrabble buff - thought it lacked something.  

But the wee plastic Cthulhus are awesome - especially the green ones from the first edition [the second printing has purple Cthulhus - what's up with that ...!?]

Essentially a novelty item, it cleverly attaches the Cthulhu Mythos theme to otherwise unrelated game play. The Cthulhu pieces are magnificent, but the card art is surprisingly weak. 

Cthulhu followers might wonder why they're giving up Cthulhu figures as they progress towards insanity instead of gaining them, why can't they summon him, or use Lovecraftian proper names.  The manual's optional rules seem offhanded and don't add enough to warrant their inclusion, maybe some cultists will post their own variants. 

This is a necessity for Cthulhu fans who like word games, but nonfans would prefer Quiddler and non word game people should just run away with their sanity intact.

A close runner up to Dixit in my personal pantheon of social games. It's utterly lacking in conflict, and any strategies are painfully obvious, so it shouldn't appeal to me at all. Yet it does.

[Playroom Entertainment 2007 edition] {Cthulhu, word; dice-rolling, word-building; optimal 2-3p} Unspeakable Words is a mediocre word game filler.  It's good for casual play and for those who love Cthulhu theme.  However, the theme is really pasted on.  Nothing special in this game but it will satisfy players who love word and dice games.   With a suitable group, it is quite fun; esp. when most players acted aggressively and were out of the game!  Winner may not be the one with strongest vocabulary!

I usually take the simplest strategy: take more risks in early game and be conservative in late game.

The components are nicely made.  The Cthulhu figures and the d20 dice are good.  The cards are thin but the illustration is good as there is a dedicated character for each letter.   The box is horribly large than necessary. I threw it away.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very clever word-building race to *almost* 100, then everyone slows down and tries not to be the first one over 100 unless they can go way over, since all other players still in the game get a last chance to beat the score (using one of the variants).  It's an elimination game but the game is almost over by the time anyone is driven insane.  A very good word game for people who don't normally enjoy making words because the letter scoring is arbitrary, taking away the tension you feel in Scrabble.  Also, the game plays in half an hour with six players (try that with Scrabble!).  The plastic pawns are a lot of fun, too.  This is really a push-your-luck game more than it is a word game.

Unspeakable Words is a reasonable concept that just doesn't work.  Players have to decide between high-scoring "dangerous" words and low-scoring "safe" words.  The bigger the word, the riskier the die roll.  In practice, players simply try to score big until they run low on Cthulus, and then the game grinds to a halt with an endless barrage of safe words while everyone tries to be the last one standing.

The die roll on a straight d20 keeps me from rating this a full 7, but a 6 would be too low.  Over three games played on New Year's Eve, I had phenomenal luck with dice rolls, while others rocked the low side, and went nuts.  All involved enjoyed play, and using phrases with the words added to the fun.  Many comments were made about the die rolls, though, so it needs the right atmosphere, though the theme itself helps in this regard.

We played with a thematic change such that Cthulu figures are *gained* with sanity check failures (0 -> 5).  This made scoring on "Unspeakable Letters" backwards, although I don't think it harms game play to do so.

I don't have an alternative to the d20 yet that I'd be more happy with at the moment.

The game is fine, goofy in a fun way, I like the simplicity of just coming up with a short word and rolling to hope you can score it... but by the end it feels a bit pointless.  When you're dealing with the randomness of drawing a few cards and many times ending up with all vowels, and then the randomness of a die roll that might mean that you'll possibly never score a word you came up with... it feels a bit just like a time-passer.

First play - 4 players - I love word games and Lovecraft so my rating is biased. Rolling the dice to prevent madness is a great idea but hardly innovative. You don't score any points on the ROUND letters (O,U,C, etc) so big scores on plays are difficult. Getting over 10 points on a word is difficult. You start with 5 sanity Cthulus. The tokens are awesome! If you don't roll higher on a 20-sided die than your word score you lose one. If you lose all 5 you go insane. It moves quickly and I heard there are many variants included in the game that are interesting. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
OK, this is pretty cute, and it's even fairly well balanced.  I just have issues with the rule that you have an option to discard all cards from your hand, instead of discarding a few of them.  It really turns the game into whoever can draw the right cards, as opposed to being a light word game that requires some planning.  But it has PLASTIC CTHULHUS!  That's worth something!

The box says it will play with two, but I think that's misleading.  It comes down to one person losing all their sanity, and the other player winning by default, so it removes some of the tension that comes with playing the game with more people.

2 plays: 2 players

For the 3D Cthulhu figures (tokens) and the alphabet cards. Basically, I want this for the utility value. Sadly, the large D20 seems to have been a substitution in the Table Top edition.

It's like Scrabble or Boggle for people who are crap at spelling. The 'sanity roll' is horribly random, but it does give young children or 'special ed' players a chance to win I guess.
Fun for 5 minutes but the rancid randomness of the dice roll makes it a pretty pointless game. Sold my copy within weeks...

The only word game that I'll play, and even suggest.

I'm still waiting for the expansion where the players who go insane in the early game are given the opportunity to break out of the asylum and hunt down and eat the winner.

Game is okay. Wish there was more chances to be crazy and make up random words, but all in all it was fun.

love the little Cthulhus. It's worth the price for them. Not much of a game though. I expected more from James Ernest.

While I appreciate the sanity check as part of the Cthulhu theme, it eventually wore out its welcome and became annoyingly repetitive.  Not to mention what a nightmare it was for the score keeper to have to keep track of what words have been used already.  A very mundane concept.  Word game lovers should stick to Scrabble and stay far far away from this one.

Well, it has a weak Cthulhu theme.  Not sure if anybody would bother playing this word game if it did not.

Basically just a game of throwing dice well. Blah.

Demoed "Wings of Glory" at Old School Gaming (Toledo, Ohio) and what a beautiful game.  We just played the basic rules, but I enjoyed it.

I started playing Mustangs and Messerschmitts years ago, and about that same time I was introduced to Fighter pilot and other air to air games.  At the time I thought they were the best games out there...  Then along came Wings of War WW1 and then later WW2 by Nexus games.  Andrea Angiolino and his partner devised and put together an air war game like no other.  After playing it a couple times, I found the rules system simple and easy to learn.  All I needed to do was develop the "Eye" for figuring out where the airplane will end up when I plot it's movement.  That comes with experience.  Overall this is a very easy game to learn and play.  I love the pre-painted aircraft for the game, but sometimes I just cannot help myself and either repaint one or get an alternate source of aircraft and then paint it myself.  That is the model hobbyist in me.

I really liked the WW1 version, so I found a good deal on the WW2 version to try it out.

Cool minis. Beer (+++) and pretzels fun. Not a serious airplane game at all.

Excellent game with a brilliant system! Social, deep and fun! 

I also own the X-Wing Miniatures game, and although a lot of people seem to compare the two games, I strongly believe that (the obvious similarities aside) the games are actually quite different. I think (if played with the Advanced Rules), Wings of Glory WW2 provides a much more realistic and deeper experience than the X-Wing Miniatures game. This does not mean that the X-Wing is not fun, it actually is! Very much so! It's just that I don't think that the two games can be so easily compared to each other. I own both games and they both scratch different itches. 

Wings of Glory WW2 (and I am sure WW1 too, I just don't own it!) is a great game! As is the Sails of Glory! :)

This is a pretty fun little game!, sound effects are a must. Makes me want to try X-wing.

We have tried the 2-player version. The game feels draggy. Playing it with the mission seemed to improve the game play.

Rating is for the entire scope of the game.  Beautiful models, great rule set, awesome gameplay.

Good to have another 4 card holders for extra players.  Like the way the rules are consolidated and you get plenty of tokens for everything in this one.

RATING: 5.5
A little dry. Primarily because it is stretching out a minute's worth of action into 30 minutes. Inclusion of missions makes the game more interesting, but not nearly interesting enough.

The plane miniatures, while good to look at, actually got in the way of the game and we fell back on the plane cards to improve the game's flow.

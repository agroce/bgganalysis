[First Impressions]
It really seems to be the command & colors system at the top of its form. Still light and easy to play, but with a couple of new elements (namely leaders, evasion maneuvers and the interesting characterization of units) that bring to the system the right amount of strategy and tactics. I need to play it more to confirm the vote, but I think it’s a really good design so far.

I like the wooden blocks. Illustrations are not exactly stunning, the board and the cards are of... well... GMT quality, but there’s nothing to really complain about: everything works just fine.

After not being too enthused by C&C for all these years, I finally get it, I realized I don't enjoy complex war-games as much as I used to and with much less time on my hands these days complex games rarely if ever get to the table. So C&C fills a niche slot - a low complexity , streamlined and enjoyable light war-game. 
Ancients is more fun to play than other games in the series because of the lack of ranged units which abound in other titles like Battle Cry or Napoleonics. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Probably my favourite of the Commands & Colo(u)rs series.

Pros:
I love the Ancients era, particularly Ancient Roman and Greek periods. The C&C system adds an element of fog of war/chaos. The wooden blocks look great. Set up is not as long as other C&C games as most battles have very little terrain. I like the emphasis on holding the line. Very thematic. Fun!

Cons:
Set up still takes a while as you have to dig out specific units for specific scenarios. The terrain tiles look cheap. There is no "facing" for the units which means that (other than blocking retreats) it makes no difference if a unit is attacked from the front or from behind. It is rare that the historical victor doesn't win the battle, which may not be fun for the person playing the losing side.

Already I must agree that this is the best C&C game yet (though I've yet to try Napoleonics). With the very sober rules system small differences in units stats play out in vastly different ways, and it's striking different they feel in practice. For example, auxiliary light infantry and basic light infantry at first glance seem very similar, but after a couple turns you'll notice that auxiliary act as light shock infantry while basic light infantry are simply ranged harassers.

The game is still a bit heavy on the dice, and I think a combat results table would bring the game to a new level. Still, for a breezy war game (a rare creature) this is a treat.

This was one of those games that you play and wonder where it has been all of your life.  Right before BGGCon 2013 I played an epic scenario with some friends from the local game group.  At this point I have gotten pretty jaded overall when it comes to new games but this one was an instant hit.

At BGGCon I ended up playing a dozen or more scenarios and a friend and I ended up stickering 2 expansions just so we could get a chance to play the cool Spartan scenarios.  I ended up buying a complete set from a guy selling his and it was in excellent condition and saved me a lot of stickering.  I am really looking forward to trying out all of the scenarios in this game and getting to explore this deceptively simple game system.

I am still at the point where I am learning something new every game, which is exciting for me.  I am however looking forward to the point where I have all of the minor rules down solid and I can run Epic Scenarios for friends.

If you are on the fence do not hesitate, this is a great game and very worthy of getting in to, even if you just go for the base game.

The flagship of the command and colors system (at least until Napoleonic comes out). Much deeper than Memoir at not much more complexity. Scoring here is the inverse of Memoir - this game shines as a stand alone, expansions do not add much more to the core game.

How much more fun can a wargame be? Genuine tactics, coupled with easy to learn mechanics, makes for a fun day out. Just that much better than Memoir 44.

RATING: 5
Simple, fast-playing, but very abstract game with some strange rules (heavy units can be killed just as easily as light ones, attempting to cross a river actually makes you safer when attacked, etc.) The more varied units in this game compared to Memoir 44 makes it a little bit more tactically interesting. But not by much. I know little of how battles from this period was fought, but I suspect this game does a bad job at simulating them.

If you have a thing for the Ancient period you would be doing yourself a disservice by not getting this game. It plays quickly and conveys exciting thematic information through simple rules.

the game is a winner because it's simple, fun and fast playing, but if you look for depth in the first place rather than fun factor, keep looking. a slugfest rather than subtle tactical game (and I prefer the latter).

RATING: 9.5
Quick to set up, puts you immediately into tactician mode, takes enough out of your hands ensuring the best laid plans will often go astray (highly contemporary to the era), no stacking, no need for informational markers to clutter play...

The best solitaire war gaming experience I have ever had without adjusting a single rule or procedure. This game forces you to do the best with what you have, not necessarily where you want to do it and in the face of a reactionary defender. Extreme solitaire compatibility as a result.

RATING: N/A
Too heavily dice-driven for my tastes. I appreciate the attempt at simplicity in the ruleset, and the aesthetics of the game, but it's just not up my street. I'm sure some people could really get into this game and explore all the variations and scenarios in real depth.

Definitely has more depth than Memoir '44 or BattleLore, which is good.  However, the looks aren't that good. I'm also afraid, that because it his hard to tell one unit type from another, C&C Ancients is much harder to grasp.

This is a good game though and I'd be happy to play it anytime. But at least for now, I'll stay true to Memoir.

The fact that it's too easy to mix up the units with each other puts me off a little. Hence, I do not always want to play C&C Ancients but will never turn down a game.

Still now most likely the best simulation of battle available, deceptively simplistic seeming at first, however when employing historical battle formations and strategy, the system amazingly comes to life and adds a depth to the gameplay that you will not find in other wargames.

Thoroughly enjoyable, entertaining and educational experience all at the same time, most likely will remain as my all time favourite for quite some time.

Played a few times but I prefer Memoir. This one seems to have more strategy (tactic?) inside, but this is one of the reasons I prefer the lighter Memoir. Also, I prefer miniatures rather than wooden cubes. I consider the colouring system and the unit types, similar to Battlelore, badly designed. I prefer the clearer and more logical "soldier, tank, artillery" approach of Memoir than the nonintuitive colour based unit types.

The only Commands & Colors you or the world will ever need.  Its siblings are barely marginal (BattleLore) and awful (Memoir'44).  This is the game in which the system works, and in which historic battles can be recreated in an abstract but satisfying way.  It's also suprisingly fun solitaire.

I just have th CC Ancients base and don´t care with all endless expansions (What a waste of wood!!)

A little "heavier" than Battle Cry, but still a very good game.  I find myself becoming more interested in this period because of the game.

Lowered the rating from 7 to 5.  Scenarios are almost always unbalanced to the historical winner. I found that after playing some of the Worthington Games offerings which use a die for activation, the cards plus the right-center-left battlefield limits the types of battles that can be portrayed. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
More detail and strategy than the other C&C-based (Memoir, Battle Cry, etc) base games.  But there is enough C&C that if you have played one, it's easy to catch on.

Very good because you really have to think through your moves more.  Not as much "gamey" moves as other C&C-based games.  You focus more on your formations and playing the cards in your hands in the optimal order to carry out your plans.

A wargame that is played within a very reasonable amount of time and has easy to understand rules. Although the card draw and dice rolling luck factor might detract for very hardcore wargamers. Also, the set up can be quite long but that is easily solved by using numerous cardboard pieces or dice for hit points instead of individual blocks. 
In conclusion, It is still strategic, tactical and the time factor will see it hit the table a lot.

A fun, light system, and a great way to introduce the uninitiated to wargaming. That said, the more you play, the more you discover C&C:A has far more strategic depth than simply moving up your line, crashing into your opponent, and throwing some dice. It’s not a game I’d want to play for entire night all too often, but when I’m short on time, or need a gap-filler, it’s great to know a game this fun with true challenges can be played in less than an hour. If you can find enough of the expansions to fill out the necessary blocks, the Epic games are a blast.

Brilliant port of Memoir 44 from ww2 to the Punic Wars of long ago. Nice solid wooden blocks, a basic board, terrain tiles, and some naff black plastic dice and a deck of nice cards make up the game. Get it. But use the up to date third edition rules.

Ultimately, I'd like to own a block wargame. I enjoy the tactile aspect and particularly like when the block faces are hidden from an opponent, to represent the Fog Of War. 

C+C:A is a sound game. Sound isn't good enough in my small collection. C+C:A isn't enough of a departure from Chess - likely the FIRST game in my collection. The hand management and unit variation features are pleasant, but not failed to add the necessary drama I might enjoy to shift the dynamic enough from the serious, high-stakes consequences of decisions in Chess to the more fun, front-loaded gambling of conflict-heavy games like Flash Duel or Cry Havoc. I would even look to Claustrophobia before this. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
In principle, I think it's better designed, cleaner, more strategic than Memoir.  My wife (who wiped the floor with me) hates the spreadsheet of unit range/CC/move/evade/etc., and misses Terrain.  Feels too much like chess to her, so won't get played much.  Ah, well.

Rating is more "for us" (ok, then it's maybe a 6, 7 tops) than actual evaluation of the game quality.

Note:  compared to BattleLore, the command cards are much more effective, and less frustrating, and the "keep your men together" is more subtle and interesting.

The only wargame that my son of 7 years understand. It's simple but I need to tell him how many dice to roll.

Good introductory wargame that is worthy of a good spot in my collection. 

However, I felt it was not very good for old Wargamers like me. This game has no historical feel or logic in battle. In that sense, it's just a meh game.

Now, this is a great game, but it isn't for everyone. For instance, advanced syphilitics may find they lack the motor control necessary to manipulate the game pieces, and the comatose may find it difficult to get into the feel of the game. I've also heard (but cannot confirm from firsthand experience) that zombies have difficulty focusing on the higher tactical  decisions in the games and may wander off in search of brains. But if your spinal column hasn't been devoured by spirochetes, you're conscious, and you're not one of the living dead, cursed to walk the streets in eternal torment as punishment for a life of sin, you'll probably enjoy this game.

I like the order system and the blocks are okay. I would have preferred counters or rotating step loss blocks and maybe separate decks. The blocks as they are feel precisely like the weird miniatures replacement compromise that they were included for.

I really dislike the way the dice system interacts with the VP system. You play to a very small number of victory points, but the game doesn't value them properly. There are 1/36 chances to eliminate stuff like light cav and leaders outright, and you are awarded VP for it. It might be realistic, but it pretty much ruins the game for me. Killing a light cav on turn two with ranged units on a low probability shot could be 25% of the necessary VP. It's too random to be enjoyable.

spanning from Rome Vs. Carthage and Alexander the Greats campaigns. This one is more absract looking than the others using the same system (Memoir 44 and Battlelore) and has a different publisher, meaning that the plastic models are replaced by wooden blocks which look lovely, but the board is thin and nasty. 

It is still a wonderful game and for me personally I have found the battles more tense and exciting than those in the other games.

RATING: 8.5
The 3rd game in the Command & Colors series behind Battle Cry and Memoir '44. Probably a better game than either of these two. Better than Battlelore also. It still has dice and cards so the luck is a bit on the heavy side but the cards are more diverse in this game and the rules give the players more meaningful choices. You also get more different types of units.

For those thinking that plastic minis would be better for a game like this I think I've come to actually prefer the blocks. The blocks are easier to handle and easier to tell apart in my opinion. Imagine 13 different types of units including 5 different infantry units and 3 different calvalry units each of which look similar. The blocks are also easier to store.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Best of the series. Multiple unit types make this a more complex game than Battle Cry or M' 44, but adds tactical depth. Blocks with artwork on the stickers are better than unpainted figures. (As well as any that I would Paint.) Dice could be better, but are usable. Upping my rating. This has become a favorite.

A very light introduction to wargaming...and fun to boot. Gobs of luck, but you can't depend on luck alone. 

My complaints are mainly about the presentation: why blocks? There's no fog of war, so what's the point? And the iconography on the stickers is soooo tiny. Cardboard counters should have been the way to go. A greater variety of cards would've been nice, too.

If you love the ancient period wars though it's a must buy!

C&C:A is my 1st foray into war games. I researched and selected it very carefully, so it's not surprising that I quite like the game. Overall it is much easier to learn to play then I expected. Though beware of the first play when all the stickers need to be applied (seriously an hour+) during initial setup. Once the rules/system are understood the game is fast and tense.   

It is worth noting that most of the scenarios are NOT balanced, so any competition should be based on playing the scenario twice (switching sides) and summing the margins of victory/defeat.

Overall a fantastic medium-light wargame that should be easy to enjoy for the majority of strategy gamers.

Yahtzee with colored dice. Well, I don't dislike playing this game, but I don't consider this as a wargame, but rather a strategy game. But it's a bit of fun too, in spite of the widespread combat results. The (un)lucky die rolls can be frustrating.

The rules, card deck, blocks, leaders and scenarios are too generic. You'll never get a Marathon, Zama, Cynocyphalae, etc. feeling. Well at least I didn't. There are no unit facing, scenario specific cards and I have to look on the unit sheet frequently, because I can't memorize, while the needed information could have been on the blocks. In its' essence the game is not much different from Battle Cry, Memoir '44 and Battlelore, though it has some improvements.

Two other points of critism is that although units take hits they don't decrease in strength until eliminated and that battles suddenly ends - when the required number of units have been eliminated. There is no anti-climax. Just a sudden end, which always feels dissatisfying to me.

Great gateway wargame. It uses the famous game system with the cards and the board divided in sections found in many games like Memoir 44, BattleCry BattleLore... In Ancients the addition of leaders take the gameplay to a higher level. The game mechanics remain simple but they provide a lot of interesting choices. Each battle takes about an hour. It is truly an enjoyable game.

I am not sure how this went as long as it did without me commenting on it. Easily one of the best wargame systems of all time (despite it being crazy simply and accessible). The game is an anomaly, as it makes me wonder why I would pay so much more for another game that while more of a simulation, doesn't deliver as much fun and just a comparable level of historicity. I wish the system was taken to bronze age, but maybe we will see that eventually.

By and large the best Richard Borg system game, and my favorite light war game of all time, and I have been playing tabletop war games for over two decades, not including early years playing Risk etc.  What sets this one apart is how tight every match feels and how important every unit feels to the battle line as a whole.  Every match feels epic, every win feels well deserved and satisfying.  I will add that the scenarios in expansions 1 and 1+6 are my favorites.

This has real -wow- factor.  Everything works and makes sense of the setting.  You can see while Memoir is Memoir and Ancients is Ancients.  It's the differnce between a sling shot and a bazooka.  Harder to play but more rewarding.

RATING: 7
Very similar in its mechanics to Memoir 44, this game is perhaps a little bit more fun for euro gamers who, perhaps ironically, might prefer battling with "ancients" rather than army men, and blocks rather than small plastic figurines. 

On the other hand, the stickered blocks for the "light units" in this game are crazy small such that it is very hard to figure out which is which for first time gamers.  Hmmm...  

This is a nice, basic war game driven by card play, unit capability determinations, spatial planning, attack timing considerations, and the rolling of specialized dice that can offer greater hits when a leader is involved, and certain rolls that force the enemy to retreat.  You have two basic kinds of attack: ranged and close combat.

For first timers, the rules are quite fiddly since certain units can and cannot do various cool things, and none of these capabilities/restrictions are shown on the actual units.  You need to reference the elaborate, but well designed, player aides.  Like Memoir 44, you can play different scenarios with varied win conditions, ensuring replayability.

Great design. It's a much deeper and strategic game than the lighthearted Memoir 44 or Battlelore.

The importance of the Leaders and of keeping a tight formation makes a rather simple design and set of rules into a very enjoyable and challenging tactical experience.

Right now, I'm playing the epic scenarios, with 2 boards side by side, which enhances the experience tremendously.

I'm not sure you need to purchase the expansions. I got them all and I'm not sure it was a wise investment. The scenarios are not so different to justify owning all the different ancient armies.

I recommend purchasing just the EPIC expansion and the extra board.

Richard Borg's best game, in my opinion.

RATING: 8
Initially daunting, but after the first few scenarios it flows pretty nicely.  Lots of chances for tactical play, and the hand management mechanics encourage good timing on top of good board position.  A very tight and fun system.

Not a huge fan of some of the more imbalanced scenarios, unfortunately.  I understand the historical relevance of the imbalance, but simply don't enjoy an unfair fight as much as I like the tighter scenarios.  Also, sometimes it feels like the victory conditions happen just as the fight gets interesting.

Nice, simple depiction of ancient battles. Easily my favourite of the commands&colors games, I much prefer the blocks over plastic figures.

The rules are pretty straightforward, and there is a definite hand management side to the game besides the actual battle tactics, but I think that once you learn to play well it gives a pretty good, simplified abstraction of warfare in this era. It captures the essential differences in the weapons systems and unit types, the importance of cohesion (both at unit and army level), leadership, manoeuvre and light unit screening. I think the system only has two flaws, in that it doesn't have much difference in staying power between different unit types, and that due to the nature of card play extensive manoeuvre on the battlefield is hard to accomplish. In fact, I'm trying to learn the much more complex SPQR system now, and I can definitely see a lot of parallels between the mechanics of the two game systems.

Considering each battle only takes 30 to 60 minutes to play, and how enjoyable it is, this is one of my favourite light wargames.

A step up from Battlecry, C&C brings an attempt to actually represent broad concepts of ancient battle. Still hurt by a huge luck component, also the different scenarios are mostly pretty similar. Fun none the less.

In addition, I have to ding the series for a blatant attempt to cash in on its popularity by producing a whole line of expansions that produce more pounds of coloured wood per gram of additional real content than one would like.

Great fun, nice components, decent re-playability.  The other games in this series never grabbed me from a long-term standpoint, the tactics were just too simple which led to the randomness becoming too pronounced.  With C&C:A, this problem has been fixed; Now the balance between speed of play, randomness and tactics is almost perfect.  One of my favorite games, I would give this a 9/10 if the re-playability was just a tad higher.  Scenarios start feeling very similar after a while.

I played my second scenario of Command and Colors: Ancients. The Battle of Crimissos River – 341 BC.  The Syracusan Army was once again victorious over the Carthagian Army.    This game was closer than the first.

C n C Ancients is more in depth than Memoir 44 or Battle Cry.  It takes slightly longer to set up scenarios .  It is not playable right out of the box.  Even so, it is a great game.

Pros:
Light war game with a nice historical feel.
Great components
Descent depth without  complex rules.

Cons:
Hours of placing stickers
Some stickers over time became unstuck.  GMT does provide extra stickers in the box for replacements.

This is an incredibly engaging light war-game.  There seems to be just the right amount of luck to keep most games tense and close, while giving you plenty of options for tactical brilliance or blunders.

There are a wide variety of scenarios. Even the ones that seem unbalanced seem to yield exciting finishes with one player making a last desperate play for victory.  Combine that with the number of different unit types and you have a game that will remain interesting after many, many plays.

RATING: 7
Diversity of troops in this game creates an extremely rewarding system that will likely outshine Memoir 44 and Battle Cry. The flaw in the game is the poor components design (board, blocks, dice). It is extremely difficult to tell different units apart at a quick glance (particularly for the small block, light infantry troops). While the artwork adds some character to the game, it's certainly not user-friendly. I'd rather make my own board and buy some small miniatures than play with the components that come in the GMT box. While I would rate the game highly, there's no way this game is worth the retail price. Can't imagine spending even more money on the expansions...

RATING: 9
A Memoir'44 és a Battlelore után sikerült kipróbálnom végre ezt is! A játékrendszer ugyanarra az alapra épül mindhárom esetben. A Battlelore magasra tette a mércét, a C & C pedig még kicsit talán a Battlelore-on is túltesz. Bár nem egyszerű összevetni a kettőt, a sok hasonlóság ellenére sem (ezért is kaptak azonos pontot egyelőre). Papíron a Battlelore a nehezebb, de másban rejlik a nehézsége: ott a tudáskártyák révén egy másfajta dimenzió is kerül a játékba bonyolítás képpen. Itt, a Command & Colorsban sokkal kevesebb a kellék, de rengeteg (tucatnyinál is több) féle egység van, ez is a játék egyik hátránya, hogy 4 oldalnyi segédlet kell a különböző egységek képességeinek áttekintéséhez (és ez még csak az alapjáték): melyik egység mennyi kockával dobhat közelharcban, képes-e távolsági harcra, mennyit léphet, milyen kockadobásokkal ér el találatot, stb. Úgy érzem, néhány csata lejátszása mindenképp szükséges az egységek megismeréséhez, de a '44 után most is jó kort választott a szerző, a római-pun háborúkkal szívesen elszüttyögök, és a témaválasztás tekintetében mindenképp jobban tetszik ez a játék, mint a Battlelore.
A legtöbb taktikai lehetőséget egyébként az elefántok és a vezetők kínálják, de a kétféle harcmodor is sok dilemmát kínál, színesítve a játékot.
A játékidő nem vészes. A kártyák nyelvfüggőek, muszáj volt játék előtt magyarítani őket.
Ahogy a Battlelore-nál, úgy itt is eljátszották azt, hogy tele van a szabály kiegekre utalással, és majd később megjelenő egységek képeivel, ez eléggé zavaró.
A játék kivitele szép, végre nem műanyag, hanem fa bábukkal küzdhetünk, de ez is egy olyan darab, amit 1 csata kedvéért nem éri meg elővenni, olyan sokáig tart elpakolni (persze attól is függ, ki hogyan tárolja)...
Összességében mindenképp ajánlom annak, aki szereti a római kori történelmet, és nem riad vissza az alapvetően egyszerű, de bizonyos részletekben aprólékosan elmerülő szabálytól. A segédletek egyébként elég profik, kb. a szabály 80%-át magukba sűrítik. 
Záró megjegyzésként annyit, hogy nem értem, miért nem favorizálják ezt a játékot közel sem annyira, mint a Memoirt, holott szerintem nyújt ez is akkora élményt. Gondolom a világháború, mint téma, többeket érdekel. De kidolgozottság tekintetében ég és föld a két játék. Tehát aki a Memoirt szereti, annak ezt is nagyon ajánlom (max. fél órányi plusz infó szükséges ehhez a játékhoz)!

I would never suggest and of the Commands & Colors sets are realistic, but C&C Ancients does make for a very good GAME.  And with all the expansions and scenarios, there is ample scope to learn this simple system and then reap maximum play value.

I like C&C, in theory. But after a few games I sold my copy. I don't have any particular gripes (unlike Memoir, which didn't have good scenarios in the box), but I'm not strongly attached to Ancients and while the game was in no way complex, using the chart felt awkward. In contrast, I didn't need to refer to anything in Battle Cry. Simple games should be simple.

What can I say about this game that hasn't already been said here on BGG? I find this game has really rekindled my love of tactical wargames. It sets up easily and plays realistically for its time period(or at least enough that I feel satisfied). 
After playing a great deal of games now, my rating has gone down. That's usually true of a game for me. The one drawback about this game for me, is the left, right, center mechanic of the cards. I think this system would be better with more generic cards encompassing the entire board, rather than the L R C play. Although I do think that the L R C mechanic works better with Ancients than with any of the other CC variants.

RATING: 10
The 10 says it all.  The perfect intro wargame for me.  quick, interesting, replayable.  Gave it a medium weight component for some rules specifically (evade, leader retreat, "support" etc.)  A real bonus is that I have played it with three women and they all liked it.

This is the best implementation of Richard Borg's system.  Very elegant design and easy to play.  Rules could be a little better written.

The C&C system is probably the best out there for light, hex-n-"counter" wargaming.  BattleLore is the best looking, and eventually, will likely be the best developed of the games in this series released to date.

Out of the box, however, I believe BL pales in comparison to C&C:Ancients.  C&C:A comes with a wider variety of full-featured scenarios, and the evade and battle back rules add tactical richness somewhat lacking in BattleLore.  Hence, BL gets an 8, where I rate C&C:A a 9.  I just feel that, without taking expansions into account, C&C:A is simply a better game than BL.

I like the continuation of the Memoir '44/Battle Cry system within the ancient warfare world.  I especially appreciate the fact that this offering just doesn't use exactly the same rules with a different theme, but deepens the rules to augment an already good system.  The role of the leader pieces are more significant, and keeping your battle line intact is vital for survival and victory.  The command card selection is distributed well, so I always felt like I could do something significant, rather than waiting for better cards to be drawn.  Aside from helping my buddy afix the stickers to the blocks, this game has provided a lot of gaming strategy and fun. [gift]

This is a hugely popular series, but I have never warmed to it.  It reminds me of Memoir '44, only with blocks (another popular series).  I am glad that the C&C series sells well for GMT, as it allows the company to produce and market the kinds of games that I do like.  Block games, in general, are tricky for me, and not every game can be an Eastfront.  I remember finding C&C dull, with little payback for the investment of time and energy.

RATING: 9.1
As expected the Ancients period is ideal for the C&C period.  I have a feeling I will play this a lot with the new COIN Falling Sky coming out in the next fex months (Gallic Wars).
In my view the C&C system didn't succeed in the Civil War or the basic WW2 game (only after 10 expansions or so of Mem44 it got the much needed diversity).
But here the system excels ! Troops are perfectly portrayed with enough variety and diversity to make it highly interesting within a rather "easy to get into" system.
I do like the Napoleonic and The Great War variant too, but the C&C Ancients system is simply its best incarnation to date.

Recommended for both starter and intermediate wargamer. Plays fast too.
It is simply the best period for this C&C system.

[i]Posted: 4/5/11, Rated: 9[/i]

At this point I have to say that I'm a fan of [person=25]Richard Borg's[/person] "Commands" mechanic.  I have copies of [i][thing=10630]Memoir '44[/thing][/i] and [i][thing=25417]BattleLore[/thing][/i], yet I still wanted to try this title, too.  Am I ever glad that I did!

While I love the production value that [company=1027]Days of Wonder[/company] poured into the other two titles (now [company=17]Fantasy Flight[/company] for the latter), they have always felt frivolous with their miniatures.  That's not a bad thing as games are meant to be fun, after all.  Still, when I finally emerged from the wracks of sticker torture, I was rewarded with a game whose appearance resonates with me.  The look of blocks on a muted board makes me think of the sand tables used in military classes.  The look is admittedly simplistic, which fits this time period perfectly.

Mechanics-wise, [i]C&C:A[/i] feels very familiar.  We're still learning how to move a large host across an open field: should we be methodical, maintaining support even though we're taking opportunity fire from archers?  Or should we rush headlong into battle, forsaking support to close with our enemy?  The learning curve here is a challenge.

But the one thing that I truly enjoy about this game is logging the game play afterwards.  By taking the pile of discarded orders, you can effectively recreate the battle.  The titles of the cards themselves provide the narrative.  It's a metagame aspect to be sure, but [i]Commands & Colors: Ancients[/i] truly delivers on multiple fronts.

Feels no way like a historical game. For example there are no rules for flanking an enemy formation which shlould be the end for it. Simple go forward, hackÂ´nÂ´slay and hope for good dice-rolls. If you are looking for a simple battle game take Battle Lore. Same designer and similar rules but better components, more fun with extra cards and it is even more tactical although it is a fantasy game.

I love this game.  The system works for the theme way better than Memoir, and just better than Battle Cry.  Playing this just feels right.  Not to mention I like the wooden pieces, and the "slightly" more advanced rules for different units.  A great great game that would be a 10 if there were plastic mini's inplace of wooden blocks, which I still love.  Great game.

I always liked the idea of the C&C series.  The previous games in this series were more 7s for me: Battle Cry, because while it was good, there wasn't any extra support beyond the base set; Memoir '44, because of the theme.

However, C&C: Ancients has the variety and the support and a theme I like, making it pretty much the perfect game in this series for me.  I like the extra mechanics given, and didn't realize how much I'd missed the leaders in Battle Cry.  This is an incredibly approachable yet complex enough wargame, and I can't wait to see what's in the expansions coming up (the first one includes a whopping 20 scenarios and 300 more units).

If there were ever a C&C: Fantasy, that would most likely hit a rating of 10 for me.

I wonder if we can somehow get a clandestine view of Richard Borg's C&C stove....

RATING: 10
Excellent wargame. Rules are elaborate but overall concept is simple: the combination of dice rolling and random card selection is a brilliant idea to "mimic" a fog-of-war approach. All expansions are great (though most discontinued). All  in all, a great game to emulate ancient conflicts - look very much forward for the Medieval set ;)

RATING: 2
More of a good thing for players fond of the previous two games. A nice light short game. By itself, I would rate the game a six. However, I  find the figures on the blocks (especially the 5/8" to be almost impossible to read in normal lighting conditions at at normal viewing angles.  For a game that relies in large part on its visual appeal it is the kiss of death. Thus the game earns a "1".

First play: It's sweet after one play, simple mechanics but way deeper than Battlelore using a very similar system.  We will play this a lot.  Will definitely be getting the expansions...need to save up some extra $.
Only complaint so far-wish the blocks were easier to identify at a glance...some of the light units look alike.
2nd-5th plays:  Every game is better with a clearer understanding of the rules and concepts.
Added glass beads to designate ordered units-keeps everything clear on fire and movement.
Leaders are the key in this game.
Looking forward to expansions.

I've been a fan of Richard Borg's Commands & Colors series since Battle Cry first came out, and this is by far the pinnacle of the series. It has enough variety in units with different abilities to keep the game interesting from scenario to scenario, but at its core it is still a simple light/medium range war game that is easy to teach and will keep the interest of players who generally shy away from war games. 9/10

After playing/owning Battle Cry and Memoir 44, I was not enthusiastic about this game and went into it expecting to say "been there, done that."  I could not have been more wrong.  There are some mechanics in this game that give the defender options (evade, battling back) that truly make the game engaging.  Also, the card play is structured in a way so that it rewards players for making their legions and phalanx fight like their historical counterparts.  Way cool.

Certainly better than Battle Cry or Memoir, more unit differentiation, better Command Cards (which means rarely stranded with no options) and a better model of the poor communications of the time than it's two brethren.  Easy, Quick and somewhat interesting, so hits that target very well.  But does it really model ancient warfare much?  I think not.  But short of GBOH I'm not very impressed with the alternatives either, and CC:A does have the advantage over GBOH as far as playing time etc.

the blocks give this game a very nice flavor. Mechanics are simple, elegant and with just the right amount of complexity. Rich Borg's rules mechanics seem to be much more appropriate for smaller scale warfare than the diluted, out-of-scale-ness of Memoir '44 (wich I dislike). Taking in to consideration a myriad of factors, I think C&C is the best game I've played in years...When can we see C&C Medievals?? I'm waiting with bait breath........Ewwwwwww....

Good game.  I was slow to play at the start of my first game and then just started moving and the game came together.  I had little experience with a game like this coming in.  Fortunately, I was put on the side with the advantage the first time which helped.  There was no terrain and not a ton of variety in the pieces in play, but the game was still interesting.  I can see how the complexity of choices will grow with other aspects in the game.

Second scenario was good with a bit of terrain (lake and hills) and played in less than an hour.  For me, the system is easy to grasp.  There are a few details, such as advance and attack with certain units, that I miss here and there but I expect that would get better with more plays.  Also, I've played the side with the command edge twice now; I imagine the level of difficulty jumps when your command level is 4 instead of 6.  It always helps to sling a rock at the leader and take him out on the first turn of the game.  :)

I've rated this game an 8 and see that it could definitely go up with more plays.

I am not a big ancients battles game fan; I played a fair amount of the old SPI Spartan game, which was adequate if largely colorless; since then, I have tried and moved on from a dozen different battles and systems, none of which have grabbed me.

After buying a few GBOH games in 2003, and laboring through the rules, and scratching my head in disbelief over how populer this series is vs. the absolutely mastubatory rules complexity, I sold all of them, and wondered if someone would ever come out with a Lite Ancients series that didn't stray into moderate (as several others I've played seem to be prone to), and could cover enough ancients ground to keep the learning curve reasonable through the whole ancients time frame.  

Then along came this series, and while some may argue it's heavy Euro, it stays just to the correct side of Lite to me, and I embrace it as a "M44 Ancients" lite wargame.  The different sized 3D blocks give a nice look, and impart size differences to the combat arms involved; the sticker icons are clear and colorful.  The rules offer plenty of combat arms differentiation, and I've set up and played every game in under 2 hours.

This series gives me a huge payback for the time invested, and is perfectly suited to my level of interest in this period's battles.

People said this was better than other games using the same system, but they were wrong.  The whole movement by flanks thing making no sense and often causing all kinds of problems where players may not be fighting each other and instead are fighting their cards.  CCA addresses this by merely adding more cards that let you move in multiple areas.  You would think after how many games in this line that the designer might have a better idea, but no.  The real problem is that on top of this arbitrary and light combat system, Borg added a ridiculous amount of chrome and fiddliness.  All of these unit types add nothing to the gameplay, the retreat rules are onerous but seem no better than the ones in Battlecry and the list goes on.

Finally the setup times are ridiculous and putting all the stickers on the blocks was painful.  This was an absolutely atrocious design decision.  I would say I am not going to support GMT any more, but that is already a given considering that on top of their production they also can't make a good game.

I am done with this system and I am done with the one-trick pony that is Borg.

Of the three Richard Borg "BattleCry"-style boardgamesin print, Commands and Colors Ancients is the example that hews closest to its theme and rewards the more thoughtful player. Also, the game is a few steps more complex than its siblings but does not sacrifice the ease with which the rules are learned nor the quick pace at which the game plays. The Command Card deck is well balanced and the sheer variety of unit types and terrain to play them on will keep players busy learning their unique traits in games for quite a while. And the production is excellent. While not as lavish as the DOW games, this item was still "done right" where it counts: in the rules and the fun in playing. If you enjoy Memoir: 44 and BattleLore, you really must try this. Prepare yourself for a remarkably different game!

The dice can be frustrating, but you have to keep in mind that in this game you control mainly the organization of your troops. A match between evenly-skilled players could end up being decided by the dice, although you can say that about any game in which they play a significant role.

I still really like this game. I really feel like a general in an ancient battle. First I thought that the history theme was just some flavor thrown in, but after a while I found that it's truly important for the overall game experience.

I like the square pieces better than the (gray) battlelore miniatures (easier to hold when moving troops); I hate how brown and beige the game is, though, and they could've printed the map on something less flimsy.

Very cool system! Its nice to be able to play a full battle in an hour. THis means the game will be played much more often than longer games.

Without a lot of rules it manages to capture a lot of the "feel" of combat in the ancients period.
Most scenarios are unbalanced though and that is a drawback to me.
I know historical battles are rarely balanced but it would have been easy during the playtesting phase to determine a set of optionals for each battle that would make it a balanced contest (for example have one side start with 1 or more victory banners, or increase/decrease one or both players hand of command cards.

I'm just not a wargamer...  I really like that these games (C&C, Battlelore, etc.) incorporate the cards and try to limit the unit types to make it war-game-light, but in the end I still rush into battle too quickly in an attempt to "make something happen" and fail to think through all my options enough.  I do think that Battlelore is better than C&C for a few reasons: 1) The theme of Battlelore appeals more to me, 2) Battlelore's deck seems simpler, 3) Battlelore's unit rules seem simpler, 4) Battlelore's campaign play seems more engaging, oh and 5) MINIATURES!.

RATING: 8
This is the best implementation of Commands & Colors I have encountered. It does seem to scratch an itch for a battle simulation in the lightest way that could pretend to any kind of relevance to its subject matter. It makes up for its relative simplicity with its active pace, though. Rather than feeling like a strategist presiding over a war room map, you feel like you're in the thick  of the battle, seeing units fall to your right and left. Think of it as "Rome: Total War" combined with chess and a handful of dice. It's a fun way to spend an hour, especially with someone with an interest in history.

RATING: 6
Initial Impressions from limited playings: I enjoyed Battle Cry as a novel approach to tactical recreations in the beer & pretzels category, but found the card/sector interaction constraining. Here, in C&C:Ancients, that constraint elevates to outright annoyance, because the underlying game itself was outstanding! There were other design decisions that also detracted from the experience I had.

I was put off by the absence of figs in a game that seemed clearly intended to showcase miniatures, but was prepared to consider the advantages of the block approach so successfully employed in the Columbia Games series. The next disappointment then, was to discover that this is basically a traditional hex and counter war game but with unusually thick and durable counters, counters that you have to assemble yourself by fixing endless decals onto pieces of wood.

Further, not only are there no "stands" to aid in unit placement/organization, far too many of the smaller blocks are almost impossible to distinguish from each other except for a tiny icon that needed a magnifying glass to discern. Getting a scenario ready to play turned out to be a major chore.

Finally, after ages of sorting and arranging we were ready to play and looking forward to the unit manoeuvre and interaction that is the real draw in ancients combat, only to find that the cards made it difficult to do anything sensible or coherent. The game stresses unit cohesion and mutual support so pushing units willy nilly or choosing to do nothing are often the "Hobbes' choices" you get to make. The one saving grace is that some of the cards give you an option to activate a unit of your choice in a given sector if you do not have the specific type of unit specified on the card; however, it was only mildly successful in mitigating the frustration I was feeling.

Overall, I was quite disappointed.

RATING: 9
Similar system to Battle Cry & Memoir'44 but different enough to consider owning. 
Probably the best in the series, but I'm biased liking this period of history. I think the system best suits this period and the changes I like - battling back, terrain etc. I also think the 'damaged units still attack the same' works in this period, consider the damage as morale loss - get to zero blocks and the unit breaks ... there's also the rule that warbands are less effective when they take their first hit. 

Only moans so far are:
The stickers didn't fit the dice (had to trim them)
The board is rather flimsy compared with Memoir'44 (but useable)
The game has units for Roman war machines but no scenario uses them and no rules for them either
The game only covers Rome vs Carthage - I want MORE ancients and MORE scenarios :)

The perfect combination of depth and playability.  Feels like a great tabletop miniatures game (with blocks instead of minis), combined with a boardgame.

As a lapsed minitures player, mainly DBA etc, this game has brought me back to fighting ancient warfare. Simple combat system with elegant command & control mechanics that can be set up and played quickly.

Rules seem pretty tight avoiding the 'rules lawyers' who can totaly spoil a miniatures game.

I found putting the stickers on the blocks was a pain but worth it in the end. Whilst the look of the blocks cannot compare to well painted miniatures, the battlefield looks good and has a nice period flavour. 

As others have mentioned, this is a splendid gateway game for getting people into wargaming, board or miniatures. Well done Richard Borg

Great game using the Command and Colors mechanics.  I like this game a lot.  

This game is a two player game only.  You may be able to work out some variants with teams, but really I think it is best as a two person.

This is a great confrontational game, and one which can change quickly for the person with various sorts of advantages.  It is a VERY dynamic game.  I think of this as sparing or dueling.  I advise playing the same scenario more than once as different things can easily happen in them.  

This could be a "war game" but it has the feel of checkers/chess/othello also.  For me, it does'nt quite scrath the wargame itch but it does offer that nice feeling of conflict.  

The historical aspect of this game is limited and basically the battle fields are mentioned and title the scenarios but other than that, there isn't as much documentation/flavor as I would like, to tell you about the leaders, or their particular skills/tactics etc to really sink your teeth into the various settings etc.  Its a favorite as its quick, you do learn, and easy to teach/learn, but it doesnt fill my head once I have left that table.  That could be both good and bad.

I definitely would like to play more of the scenarios and get deeper into the stategy and tactics of the system.  Some have complained about the luck factor but I felt that every turn I had a good card to play and options open to me to mitigate the randomness of the dice.  7 for now.

One of my ten favorite boardgames of all time!
This game is the perfect balance between simplicity and complexity.
The core system is insanely fun, but BattleCry and Memoir '44 were too simple. This game fixes that (and also adds a lot more actual tactics.)

The ancients theme was the one I was least excited about, but it's easily the best version of the C&C system (possible exception/tie with Napoleonics cuz I haven't played that one yet). Also, having just played through the entire campaign, I'm much more interested in the ancients theme(s) now.

Aesthetically I prefer green boards to brown (Memoir, BattleLore, etc.) but I LOVE the blocks. Admittedly BattleLore 2nd ed is the best looking of the C&C games (and it uses minis), but the blocks look REALLY good when they're set up ready for battle. Plus the symbols on the blocks makes it easy to remember any given unit's capabilities.

I just can't recommend this game highly enough!

Fantasterrific war game, pretty complex with all the different exeptions for all the different units, can get confusing. But its fun once you get the hang of it. The given scenerios are based on real historical battles which adds to the authenticity. Try it out.

wargame de batallas clásicas, con motor de cartas, para dar ordenes a unidades y secciones del campo de batalla. Del estilo del memoir, pero con mayor acierto en el tipo de cartas que existen.

Não gostei deste jogo, tanto que o vendi. É um Wargame com vários cenários históricos. Por ser fiel ao que aconteceu as batalhas são um tanto desbalenceadas. São muitas regras para lembra e para quem não tem experiencia com wargames (como eu) pode se tornar enfadonho. Os componentes variam de muito bons (caixa muito resistente) a muito fracos (como o tabuleiro que poderia ser bem melhor).

Like it much better than Memoir '44 -- more options, or maybe just more balanced cards, or maybe got lucky with card distribution.  Hard to say whether rating will rise or fall with more plays.  Could rise if play speeds up significantly with increased familiarity (as I expect); could fall if balanced card distribution of first game turns out to have been a fluke.

An improvement compared to Memoir '44. The combat system seems better suited to the ancient combat formations, than to the much more fluid modern day conflict. Still not pleased with the balance in the scenarios. Calvary rules the day, as do elephants. Perhaps that was historical, but makes for somewhat unbalanced game play, especially when command cards are drawn to activate them every turn. I sent an elephant unit raking along the enemy line, simply decimating the opponent's heavy infantry in that game. Note: It took me 4 to 5 hours to properly affix the stickers onto the wooden blocks.

Worth every penny of the $310 or so I've spent acquiring everything. This is a wonderful system I hope to still be playing with my son in 20 years!!

My one play of Memoir 44 was eminently forgettable. I'm amazed at how much better this system works for Ancients. I'm not a tactical wargame fan, but this game is absolutely fantastic. I love the bits, I love the command cards (their utility has been tweaked and has a much better 'spread' than in Battle Cry on M44). Plus, my son can play with me at only 5 years old, and it's a lot of fun for both of us.

Was very disappointed with this game when I first got it.  Is that all there is to it?  It seemed that there is not much to do - just move a few guys and roll some dice. It seemed that it was all down to the luck of the roll and draw of the cards. But after a few games I started planning around my hand of cards, trying to make things happen and the game came alive.  There doesn't seem to be enough detail in the game (no facing, losses don't reduce hit dice etc.) at first but after a while you notice that the little, almost insignificant rules actually really flesh out the game and bring the subject to life without getting in the way of the game.  Pure genius!

Only played twice. Obviously very similar to Memoir '44, but the wider range of units and slightly more complicated rules about unprotected flanks and leaders make it a better game. The 'I've got a crap hand of cards, so I can't do anything useful' flaw is still there though.

RATING: 8
Very enjoyable "light" wargame. I had my doubts before purchasing it as I was concerned about depth and period feel, but it is not too bad in that department. Play it in 45 minutes to 1.5 hours. Nice casual filler game.

PROS: Simple. Light, Fun. Quick. With just enough period flavour to not overly cheapen the experience.

CONS: To play well requires some card management experience, which might put some folks off. Especially if they dislike not having total control over their units. There will be times when you just cannot move those troops who are about to be surrounded or administer the final coup de grace.

I like this game, and would like to play more.  The game is relatively easy to set-up, and plays smoothly.  I think I prefer Battlelore of all the C&C games I have played so far, but only because the fantastic elements add some zany fun.  The leader rules in C&C add a good deal, I like them. Overall, very good, fun and approachable wargame.

RATING: 8.8
RULES: **** - The rules as written are quite a mess and leaves one scratching one's head in confusion, however, once you read a well-made summary, the simplicity of rules and, at the same time, the variety of possibility really shines through.
STRATEGY: **** - There are quite many strategic choices to be made. This myriad of options is usually whittled down to just a few by the Command cards you have, but it doesn't diminish the importance of the said choices.
TACTICS: ***** - The units are sufficiently different to warrant choosing, which ones are better to do the job at hand, and positioning is quite important.
LUCK: *** - Dice rolling abound, however, there are ways to manage your chances to some degree, thus it doesn't quite break the game. 
PLAYER INTERACTION: ***** - It certainly doesn't feel as a multiplayer solitaire, because each and every enemy move can and probably will force you to adjust your battle plan to make the most efficient use of your strategy card.
REPLAYABILITY: ***** - Many different scenarios, each of them offers different challenges to both commanders, making the game very unrepetitive.
THEME: ***** - Even though the rules are quite simple to grasp, they are sufficient to simulate the most general aspects of ancient warfare correctly, which is really all that is needed on the scale the game works.
BALANCE: **** - True, some of the scenarios you might play are not necessarily balanced, however, since the game is quite short in nature, this issue is quite easily solved by playing the same scenario once for each side and comparing with your opponent how you both did.
DOWNTIME: ***** - The game is quite fast flowing and does not devolve into long grandiose moves where one person moves his pieces for half an hour and the opponent has no choices but watch.
ACCESSIBILITY: **** - the game is quite simple, short and is for two players, thus finding opponents should be really not a problem. A possible turn off is war theme and messy rulebook, however, generally these are only minor issues.

Really enjoyed the mechanics and the theme. I understood most of the mechanics after taking a couple of turn. Each unit has its own characteristics which helps bring out the flavor of the period.

RATING: 10
Yea Gods, I avoided this game for a long time.  Why oh why?  Who knows.  I certainly played every other iteration of the Commands & Colors system.  Memoir never really hit the spot, being a little too limited and a little too simple (the electronic version on Steam is the definite way to go for that fix).  After playing more serious war games, C&C just seemed too simple and bland.  Oh how mistaken I was.

Two factors finally made me go for this one.  I got interested in ancient warfare after getting into Field Commander: Alexander (it doesn't hurt that Ashar loves the ancient world).  I also had the opportunity to play C&C: Napoleonics.  That was key, in that it showed me how much period flavor the system can have with just a few tweaks to the core rules.  Yes, this is still a fairly  light wargame, but it is plenty muscular, and certainly much more so than Memoir.

Games of this are quick.  Match play is de rigueur, and you can do both sides in 90 minutes.  The ability of units to "battle back" makes for a MUCH more realistic, fun, and speedy game when compared to Memoir.  The variety of Command cards really opens the game up; no longer will you be hemmed in by a crappy hand.  Leaders are great: thematic, and they work just like you hope they would.  The lack of major terrain issues is also a plus, and keeps things streamlined.

Really, the game is a masterpiece.  It went from being a "why buy?" to being my favorite war game to being in my top ten damn quick.  And the expansions look very tasty (although a bear in term of storage space).  I managed to snag the Greek wars expansion before it disappeared, and it adds even more flavor - not much in the way of new rules, but new battles that Ashar requested!  This is an excellent 2 player game.  Even if you are not into war games, if you play a lot of 2 player games, you owe it to yourself to pick this one up.  So much fun!

I've attempted to play several more traditional hex-and-counter style wargames, all which ended in a lack of fun/enjoyment.  Playing this game is a joy, in comparison.

RATING: 9
After my serious disillusionment with BatteLore, I've gone back to this and been hugely impressed. I'm not sure why it took a cycle of boom and bust with Battle Cry and BattleLore to finally find the entry in this system that I really like, but every scenario I've played in the basic game has been a winner, tense and interesting and at least somewhat evocative of the historical battles, something no other C&C game has reliably achieved. The games are long enough to feel like they are developing in interesting ways, but not so long as they drag. The pacing is good. The luck is not out of hand. I've been really impressed how much this has grown on me post-BattleLore, while it didn't truly grab me before that.

Scenarios in later expansions don't seem to have quite lived up to the ones in the base game. While all the ones I've played in the base game have been good (although I should say while I have played most of them, I haven't played them all), the same can not be said of the later entries.

RATING: 9
I got pretty tired of hearing about the commands and colors schema being more suited to the ancients than it is to a WWII setting and didn't think that it was possible for this game to breath too much life into a system I felt I'd already become pretty proficient at.  

Boy was I wrong!

There are quite a number of ideas in C&C:A that make it a much different exxperience than in M'44.  Terrain is no longer the factor it was.  Instead, you really need to concentrate on the unit types and the ways they can be used to influence the outcome of the battle.  Battling back and evasion are of special note here.  They are tactics that aren't available in M'44 but that are ALWAYS on your mind while trying to rout your opponent.  

This game has made my heart race every time I've played it and I can't wait to try it again.  What a blast!

RATING: 6
I prefer the other games (M44 and Battle Cry) in the series quite a bit more.  This one got too complex and wargamey for my tastes, with lots of little rules and rule exceptions.  I'm sure it would go smoothly after a bunch of plays, but we were constantly checking the rulebook.  I just don't see why I'd ever play this over Memoir 44 unless I was playing with a wargamer.

Probably my favorite in the C&C series. I see why it's a popular game as it's very easy and fun, but this still feels over-ranked in my opinion.

RATING: 5.5
[12/8/2008] Upon further plays, I've decided to bump up my former 5.5 rating to 6.5. I'm still very much dissatisfied with the lack of any rear vulnerabilities, but I've used a simple house rule adressing that in my more recent games. With it, I'd rate the game higher.

[6/11/2006] This doesn't really scratch my ancient battles itch. My main beef is that the importance of intact lines and the vulnerability of  flanks and a line's rear isn't really reflected in the game. A variant rule introducing 'facing' might do that trick without making the game significantly more complicated.

IMO, reflecting the above in the game would have been more worthwhile than the various unit chrome. Not that I dislike the latter or anything. I just think that the designer could have spent a little more time on getting the fundamentals of ancient warfare right at the expense of some of the details he focused on. As far as I'm concerned, the result would have been more true to ancient warfare, while cutting out some of the fiddliness of the game.

Like the other C&C games, I give this game high praise for being light, accessible, having a quick playtime/good pace, while retaining a good amount of strategy. I'm not too keen on the blocks - BL's banner system worked better for me for setup and distinguishing units at a glance (and stickering them all was a royal pain), but they're sturdy and tolerable. I love the Leaders and the evasion rules. Since every unit can battle back it makes things a little more heated than BL, though it does put less emphasis on keeping your units bold. However, due to the cards in the deck it's always good to keep your units aligned. Speaking of cards, the card mixup in this game is the best in the C&C series. Everything feels balanced and it feels like you get really useful cards a lot more frequently. My biggest issue with the game is the reference sheets. They are DEFINITELY not as user friendly/intuitive as the reference card system, and as a result it took me much longer to get acquainted with all the units in Ancients than it did in BL and Memoir. They're bulky, too. My rating for this would probably rise if I played it more, but dealing with the stupid reference sheets just puts me off.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.8
Does it feel like ancient warfare?  Yeah.  Just as Memoir *feels* like WWII.  Are either one a simulation?  No.  When you buy this, should you feel a little hosed?  Yes.  I would anyway.  Will I buy it anyway?  Maybe, but I would want to add some rules that aren't there and develop my own scenarios.  Basically change the game completely.  I don't really like games where to play them the way I feel they should be played, I basically have to reinvent the game (ala Polarity).  Is Memoir the better deal?  Without a doubt.  Only get this if ancient warfare interests you more than WWII.  That is an extremely small portion of the population.

A light wargame, the ancient theme (large scale line-combat) really fits well with this variation of the Commands & Colors System. Most of the scenarios are fun and play fast.

This is a fine version of the C&C system. I definitely like it more than Memoir '44 as it has a little more meat to it. Sure, the blocks don't look as good as the plastic figures in MM'44 (or BattleLore), but the gameplay isn't as simplistic. The variety of the units is quite good (better than the other two mentioned games), but generally speaking these kind of games aren't really my thing. And if I feel in the mood to play one of these type of games, I slightly prefer BattleLore.

Received via a math trade for Urban Sprawl.

Rated 9 after one play. I've played Memoir '44 a handful of times. I'm certainly no wargamer, but with Memoir '44, I appreciated the direct combat, the dice chucking, the maneuvering, and the streamlined set of rules. So, I was curious how this slightly more complex version of the same system worked.

Simply put, I like it better. Where M44 forces your attention toward terrain and position, C&C:A requires you to consider unit formation. The result is an engaging push and pull between two oppoosing lines as each player tries to find the weak link. 

Compared to M44, the complexity emerges as greater diversity of units, and also new rules such as evade and battle back. But more importantly, the leaders also add a fascinating dynamic. Units in proximity to leaders have a greater chance of "hits," and so effective use of leaders to augment areas of your army is something I'm curious to explore.

With one play, I'm very impressed, and I hope to play this some more.

Update: ...and though I really like this game, I ended up trading it away. For a brief moment, I owned M44, and this, and Battlelore 2nd edition. I decided to trade C&C: Ancients away. M44 is the easiest to teach and most approachable game in the C&C series, and I invested in Overlord maps. Battlelore provides the fantasy setting and incorporates setup into the actual gameplay. C&C: Ancients has the most complex ruleset, and I wasn't finding anyone in my local gaming group that was enthusiastic to play it. Off it went in a math trade!

Just had a serious try at this game and think it's one of the best of Borg's games. Quick to learn and play. Simple but yet keeping some of the subtleties of ancient warfare. Also recommendable for players new to wargaming. I wish though GMT made some nice miniatures instead of the wooden blocks...

RATING: 9
I like this deployment of the Command and Colors system better than Memoir 44.  The battles in C&C:A, while still significantly abstracted, feel more like an ancient battle to me than Memoir feels like a WWII battle.  Fun to play, cool wooden blocks, nice sticker art.

I was a bit concerned with the whole CDG aspect, but took a leap of faith on this one. It was well worth the risk. The system is simple, quick-playing, and in the context of the subject matter the limited command and breaking up the battlefield into center and flanks makes sense. There is very much a cinematic story feel to the game as it unfolds, and the cards add an interesting layer of difficult choices to the tactics.

Deeper and more satisfying than Memoir, solo playable.  Would prefer even more realism (unique unit characteristics) but a great way to draw in new gamers.

Edit- increasing score after further playings.  The game has more depth that is seems on the surface.  You can't beat this game if you have 60-90 minutes for a game.

RATING: 7.5
My new favourite game. I'd give it a 10 if it came with mounted board (I know it does now) and more armies. 

Rating reduced to 8.5. One major flaw has emerged upon repeated plays. Namely, it shouldn't take 30 minutes to set up a 60 minute game. The ratio of set up time to play time is a little ridiculous. Luckily the game itself is worth it. 

Further Edit: No, it's not worth it. Traded away. It hurts a bit, because at first I loved it so much, but the cracks in the veneer showed, and they became glaring and impossible to ignore.

Great light "wargame". I originally picked this up instead of Memoir '44 but I might end up picking that one up as well after a few plays of this.

I wish it had plastic minis.  There are about a BAZILLION stickers that you have to put on the little wooden blocks.  If they were going to do wood blocks, they should have stenciled the units on...like the original Stratego or something.  However, it is a great game...once you get used to the weird abstract symbols for who is what.

A good game in the C&C series.  My least favorite because 1) I struggle keeping the units straight and 2) there is not a good forum environment (can't stand consimworld) and 3) it is hard to play this one PBEM with all the evade interrupts.  

Because of 2, I don't feel I know the latest errata and clarifications like I do with BattleLore and Memoir.  Because of 3, I don't have as many plays logged - and probably why I can't keep the units straight.

But a solid game none the less and probably the best match for the C&C series.

Excellent 2 player light war game. It's pretty heavy for most board games but it's feather light to a war gamer. It's an excellent tactical and strategic heads up game. The biggest flaw to this one is the components, the colors are subdued and the map and tiles are plain. The army units are stickers you have to stick to colored blocks with some plain artwork. This one has super good gameplay but it's not a looker for sure.

RATING: 9
A downright excellent addition to the C&C series!  Borg's system shines in Ancients.  While Memoir is great for so many reasons including it's simplicity, C&C: Ancients uses it's unit variety and additional complexity to best effect.  Also, and this might seem strange to some, I find stickering all those hundreds of blocks not only a badge of honor but quite therapeutic.  Can't wait for when C&C: Medieval gets off P500 :)

Pros: The system seems to fit the theme exceedingly well. It feels right, puts you on the field of battle. It's easy to learn. Plays fairly quickly, and for 2!

Cons: Outcome can feel somewhat too abrupt or unsatisfying; the journey is more rewarding than the destination sometimes. Graphically uninspiring; I just can't get excited about how this game looks.

RATING: 8
On one play. It has the feel of an ancient battle to it and plenty of unit variety. it is very playable. Yes, luck plays a significant role in it but no more than most Ancient wargames (DBM for instance) the command mechanism is acceptable and more interesting than a PIP system - though perhaps not as context related as Warmaster Ancients leadership rolls. Blocks vs figures? Well if you really wanted to you could play this game with stands of 10mm figures but the blocks give one the ready to run option are quite attractive and far more satisfying than counters. Improvements? Well, perhaps a zone of control sysatem (but one could argue the hex = the ZOC). Or more infectious negative morale system (eg. effect of friends retreating) although the postive effect of morale: supporting adjacent friends is there. Supplements? yes please - more armies, a campaign system. A fantasy version?

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Top notch components, in typical GMT style. As to the game itself, I found rolling straight to-hit-sides of d6 terribly luck-prone, especially considering the fact that usually you roll the same number of dice whether you have 1 or 4 blocks of a unit left. This is similar to Memoir 44, of course, and well established a mechanism, but for me not one I enjoy. There is quite some skill involved in learning to work your lines and managing your hand, and also figuring out what your units are best at. However, I never felt drawn into the storytelling aspect that each wargame ought to have, due to the very abstracted depiction of battles. This is a fine beer and pretzels game, just not one I will seek to play or own.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Of the Richard Borg games in this genre (Battle Cry, Memoir '44 and C&C) this one is my favorite. The components are the most modest, but they are fine for what the game is. I don't really know why the blocks are used rather than something else...but they are fine. I think the multiple unit types, the leaders and the way the tactics are built into the deck and movement/combat rules make the decision-making far more interesting in C&C.

RATING: 9
Finally, the Command and Colors system gets everything exactly right, largely owing to the fact that the system is perfectly suited to Ancients combat.  I loved Memoir '44 intially, but repeated plays made me realize both that it didn't really feel like WWII and that it was really a pretty shallow game all around.   Aside from that I got really tired of the Euro-cutesy silliness of it all and when the overpriced and ridiculously packaged expansions came out, I sort of lost interest in it.  So finally, here is C&C: Ancients...it's got a much more mature sensibility all around and the added complexity in unit types and capabilities puts this in just about the perfect level of detail versus abstraction.   Momentum, elephant rampages, leader effects...in sum, this is the C&C game to buy- it's better than Battle Cry as well.  Hats off to GMT for a great production and here's looking forward to expansions...bring on the hoplites!

RATING: 8
I knew I would love this game and I do. It is similar to Memoir 44 and Battlecry. The cards have a better balance in my opinion. You usually never get a card that only moves one unit. However, my opponent seems to have an amazing amount of luck with the dice. We played six games and I did manage 2 victories. In one game I double timed with 4 heavy infantry and rolled 20 dice with a leader my odds of hitting were 55/120 which means I should have had 9.16 hits I got 6 and retreated two of his units. He attacks back with a leader and a separated unit odds of 23/54 with 9 dice he should get 3.8 hits he hits on all 9 dice. His archers attacking with 2 dice should hit 1 in three he hits double the odds not just in one game but in all 6 games. I saw attacks where his archers would wipe out complete units in two shots. I had one game where his light infantry and archers took out my entire center I mean they took out 4 complete units.

[u]Very enjoyable[/u] card-driven tactical wargame and my favorite one! It feels like a tabletop miniature game focusing on the Punic wars (Rome vs. Carthage; although there are several other scenarios as well, like the Truceless War). The best title in the [i]Commands & Colors[/i] series because it emulates perfectly the ancient theme, it has an excellent deck of cards who rewards skillful play and it implements very well features like Evade, Retreat, Battleback or Leaders. Great components, playability, re-playability, simple rules but great depth. When I play it I feel like an ancient general.

Was tempted to rate as an 8 and then upgrade after a few more plays if warranted, but upon reflection decided that it was worth the 9 rating straight up. This is the first true war game I have played and it was excellent. Loved the depth of strategy involved, it played in a good amount of time and has nice components. 

29/12/2012 - Played this one again (lost 5:7 to Tom). This one has really grown further for me so I've upgraded it again to 9.5. I expect it may get to 10 as I think it has real staying power. 

9/6/2013 - After 6 months, played this again twice (been playing too many other things) and really loved it. It hasn't lost any of its appeal and its rating is still justified. Lost the first scenario 2-6, but then managed to turn the course of history on the second scenario 7-4.

7/12/13 - Played the next two scenarios with Tom (was fighting against history each time). Won the first scenario 6-3 as Tom charged his warriors over the hill trying to score a quick victory. Fortunately my 2 command cards were sufficiently useful to counter and had some good rolls. This (and Tom's lack of use of cavalry and ranged units) put him on the back foot. The next scenario was relatively even to start however Tom started to make use of his greater range which took its toll on my line. This put him up on banners around midgame. There was then a clear turning point in the scenario where I managed to use double time to strike with 2 heavy units 1 medium (with 2 leaders) against Tom's line. Alas my rolls were terrible (scoring only one hit with 5 dice in one case) and then Tom's subsequent counter attack crushed me.

2/1/14 - Played the next three scenarios as Rome and was able to pull off a victory each time (preserving history twice and changing it once). One scenario was clearly in Rome's favour and was a relatively easy victory. The other two were very close (one banner margin each time), and I played some aggressive strategies that could have backfired, however fortune was with me both times. 

20/6/14 - Finished the base game campaign, with Rome (me) victorious 8 scenarios to 7. Going into the last two battles, Carthage was ahead 7 to 6, however Rome was able to preserve history and take the final two for the win. Really great game.

Very very nice wargaming system.  Perfectly balanced between accessibility and complexity.  The problem is, I just can't get any of my friends or family to play this game with me.

Commands and Colors System:  the one where the use of leaders and formations make a huge difference.  Certain cards make use of line formations, which are useless if you haven't arranged your troops to take advantage of them.  Similarly, your placement of leaders will determine whether you can take advantage of certain cards, more so than in Napoleonics, for example.  A beautiful game in the C&C system that plays differently from its cousins.  It's intriguing and requires some good knowledge of the rules and cards to be successful.  Your ranged attacks are limited to slings and arrows (of outrageous Fortune), so your medium and heavy infantry are pretty important, as are the cav.

It's a decent simple game, accessible to all ages.
After glueing stickers to the cubes for 3 hours, I was glad I did not buy the expansions and was a bit disappointed by the fact that this game has no historical depth or any type of fog of war mechanic, which I was sort of hoping for, considering I knew these were cubes.
For better or for worse, 2 unit armies, like chariots and elephants are easy kills, which maybe makes sense in a way, because you have to pretty much use them in edge cases and later in the game.
I find the edge of battle field mechanics to be anti-climatic.
But overall, I enjoyed rolling the dice and it was always a close game. In just a few games I have seen great upsets happening in what looked like easy fights, with generals dying and heavy infantry crumbling to weaker opponents, for me that's a good thing.

Even better than Memoir.  More strategic, deeper but not slower.  I agree with the mass sentiment that it feels much more like and ancients era wargame than Memoir does a WWII game.  It still manages to have the excitement of Memoir's endgame.  Great game!

A nice aincient battles simulation. The board is really flimsy, but it works. I like the wooden block pieces. They don't look as cool as the Battlecry or Memoir pieces, but they are easier to use and they give the game a nice feel. There's not as much terrain in most of the scenarios as I'd like, but that's because they used to be very picky about their battle fields.

RATING: 8.5
An excellent game for new or not-too-serious wargamers.  It's my wife's favorite for our game sessions as it doesn't require an entire day or evening committment.  It's also a good option for experienced players when you don't have a lot of time or haven't read the rules for your newest game purchase.  Commands and colors works well for modeling ancient combat, better than than the attempts to use it for WWII or ACW.  Except for facing, it is a pretty good simple system.  The card activation means that battles don't play the same way twice.

Hands-down my favorite C&C game thus far.  Came to the system via Memoir '44 (which I also love), and this version of the system has inspired me to devour as much military history from the timeframe as I can get my hands on, so as to better understand the tactics involved.

Better than Battelore or Memoir 44, only the setup time is annoying (even with the extra boxes I bought). What I really like is that even for an unbalanced initial situation, you can figure out the problem of your position and how to fix it. So there is strategy here. And if you get warriors behind enemy lines, well, that's a tactic I really like. -1 for setup time.

Amazing game. So many individual units and so many different scenarios. Love the system with its card play, which is ideal for solo play (just choose a different hand of command cards each turn - it works really well). The dice have a habit of messing up your plans too, so nothing is certain on the battlefield.

Inna final analysis, this is the best of the C&C series. Really. With such a broad range of units and strategies and scenarios... I didn't think an ancients game would bump off a WWII game, but Memoir 44 is not really coming back. Sorry.

Very impressed with the design, which somehow creates the sense of ancient warfare with minimal rules overhead. It's not a grognard game - far from it - but I find myself rewarded for using troop types the way they were historically used, and punished if I veer to far off. Scenarios seem to play out "right". Clearly not a simulation, far from it, but eminently successful as a fun, fast, light strategy game with ancient warfare theme.

Putting the stickers on a rainforest of blocks is a nightmare, but once that's done its a good looking game that can be played to a conclusion inside an hour.  Reminiscent of Ancients to me (I have not played M44 or Battle Cry) which is no bad thing.  Game ends can be a little "gamey" as you set out after the depleted unit that will give you the final flag you need, but other than that its pretty good.

C&C: Ancients is currently one of my favorite two player games and at the same time one of my favorite solo games. The commands & colors system really shines in this ancient setting. The small tweaks that are unique to this game (leaders, battle back, line cohesion) really help to immerse the players into the theme. The blocks work really well as playing pieces, the illustrations are nice and when set up the blocks do look like an army. The huge elephant blocks look really intimidating when facing small infantry blocks. The blocks are also really easy to store and move around, making them an all around winner. There is still one question I'm debating - is this better than Memoir'44? I'm taking a rain check on that one, come back later to find out.

The best of the series, both because the system better fits ancient warfare and because they tweaked it with some interesting additions for the era. I enjoy it quite a bit, but with a big caveat: I know nothing about ancient history or warfare. I could see myself buying all the expansions and really getting into this if I ever developed an interest in learning more!  As it is, it's an occasional play that takes a back seat to Memoir due to the time period portrayed. 

Update: played it a lot more recently, and read up a bit on the period. It's really good.

Just received - the components look great, although a mounted board would have been nice. I have just embarked on the sticker adventure - takes a while but they look great. Can't wait to play!

Update: 1/16/2008: Just played my first game, after having owned the game for a year! It is very good - more depth than the other C&C games that I have played (Memoir '44 and Battlecry) due to special combat rules (evade, battle back, bolster morale, leader) and the greater variety of units. A big bonus is that despite the added complexity, my wife enjoys playing it with me, and actually beat me in our first game! I like the quality of the components, other than the flimsy mapsheet, but since I also got Expansions #2 and #3, I can (and did) play on a fully-mounted board, which made the playing experience perfect. I do think the player aid charts are a bit cluttered and confusing, so I made my own version (which I will post at some point), and my own complete, expanded sequence of play sheet, both of which greatly aided our first play. I definitely recommend this game!

My favorite of the C&C  series of games.  Why?  Everybody can battle back.  This helps mitigate not being able to activate units in a section that your opponent is making a thrust in.  I also like evade.  It took me awhile to understand when to use it, but it is a lifesaver.  I also like leaders.  They add a nice touch, but can and do die.  I also like the wide array of units.  At first it may seem confusing to keep them all straight, but there is a handy reference sheet included, and after a few games you seldom need it.  There are a bunch of scenarios in the box, and others to be found if you look.  The game is supported with several expansions.

I like the blocks.  They are easy to collectively pick up and move, more so than miniatures.  The dice are crap, but functional.  I ordered the nice ones from Valley Games.

I've had to weaken and upgrade my rating to a 10. No, it's not perfect, but it is as close as any game in my collection comes, and therefore deserves the Big Score. It would simply be churlish to rate it any lower. The Borg system captures my impression of ancient warfare perfectly. A piece of 1/8 x 24 x 36 plexiglas to lay over the board has been a boon. We also have two sets of the gorgeous VG dice too. If you like this game, you *must* get some of these: they are a delight. The faces do wear pretty quickly, unfortunately, especially the helmet. NOTE: expansion plays are incorporated into the main game play count

RATING: 7
Really fun, quick, light war-themed game in the mold of Battlecry and Mem '44.  This has much more historical flavor than its ACW and WWII cousins, however, because the card-based command system actually suits the nature of ancient battles, as does the brittle nature of the units.  The unit differentiation is a bit top-heavy in my view.  I'm not convinced it delivers quite enough extra gameplay or decision-making for the added complexity; but the quick reference cards make it all easy enough to follow, so this is more of a nit than a real criticism.

A light version of SPQR, this game has several things going for it - short playing time, relatively easy movement and combat system, a variety of unit types, and leadership bonuses.  However, there are couple sticking points.  The first is that damaged units fight as effectively as full strength units.  More problematic, however, is that tactical simulations just don't work right when card driven.  The flow is too chaotic, the command and control is goofy, and a few of the better cards can make or break the battle at crucial moments.  This combination more or less reduces the game to a card/dice luck fest, even if it doesn't feel like it at first.

I'd rather just play [i]SPQR[/i].

Wow, what an exciting game!  Unit differences are tangible and can be put to effective use.  Unlike Memoir '44, the sparse terrain in C&CA enables you to react to your opponent's manuever rather than navigating a maze of obstacles.  Leaders and retreat rules are wonderful.  Scenario sides are asymmetric but balanced.  Tense and thematic, captures the feeling of command better than M44.  Impressive.

The game is great fun and a great step forward for the Borg games. It actually reflects the dynamics of ancient warfare pretty well. If the physical components were better I would rate the game higher, and I'm baffled that more people haven't commented on the lack of quality in the game components. This game retails for $15 more than Memoir 44, but delivers about half the physical quality. I think GMT spent more money on the box than they did on the map, which is the heavy cardstock they call "deluxe" in some of their other games. Instead of neat little miniatures, you get wooden blocks and sheets of stickers that you have to put on yourself. No plastic sorting tray like Memoir or Battle Cry, and the dice are simply awful (Valley Games makes a great replacement set, but, of course, this will cost you extra). All that said, once you get used to the blocks, they look pretty good, and as noted earlier, game play is very good. (They introduced a much nicer board with Roman Civil Wars expansion.)

Category: Light, tactical wargame.

This is the first game I pull out when trying to get somebody involved in wargaming. Playing with an experienced opponent, you can pretty clearly understand the strategic considerations during your first play. The ease of rules and play enable clear focus around strategy and tactics without flipping thru rulebooks or pouring over charts. It is card-driven, so you need to be comfortable with giving up some control to the deck.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This might just hit the sweet spot for me, in terms of complexity versus flexibility versus "realism".  Units are just different enough to have character; record-keeping is simple, yet gives a good picture of relative "fragility", card-order system isn't as limiting as I thought it might be.  Need more plays to refine some of these thoughts.

RATING: 7
This game is fun, and reasonably quick to play. But I've found with time it's lost its luster for me. I'm not sure if it is just that I don't find the Rome vs. Carthage scenarios as interesting anymore, or if it has simply been eclipsed both thematically and in sophistication by the Napoleonic iteration of Commmands & Colors. In any event, I'm usually happy to play it—it's just no longer one of my top choices.

Memoir'44 moved to the Ancients.

I really like that attacked units can battle back if not forced to retreat. Attacking is not always a no brainer now. The bolster morale rule is also good as it helps keep your line intact which is important here.

The blocks are ok and look really cool. I just wish they had made the different units easier to distinguish. I can't count the number of times I've mixed up my LI with my Aux units already.

The dice are horribly and really don't match the quality of the rest of the game.

I am a huge fan of ancient history and Rome holds a special place in my heart.  This is a game I have never played against another player.  It is one of the only games I have purchased knowing I might never have the proper partner to get it to the table.

Based on two solo plays, I quite like it.  It has a similar feel to some miniatures ancients games, in which maneuver of heavy lines is slow and incremental and combat is simplified and dice-dependent.

I like the way your hand of cards allows you to know most of your options over the next 4-5 turns, allowing(/forcing) you to build a strategy around that knowledge.

RATING: 9
Command & Colors: Ancients originally appealed to me because of its parallels with my board gaming history. Tactically, it is very similar to the CMG's I played in the past, and many of the lessons I learned with those games carried over to Command & Colors. Command & Colors: Ancients' advantage was its ease to learn. The other CMGs I played had both complicated rules and a need to learn the different abilities of each and every unit. With Command & Colors, only a handful of units needed to be learned before play, meaning that even those who had difficulty dealing with the large information that a CMG presented could play. These traits alone would not be enough to place Command & Colors: Ancients in my Top 10, however. 

While Command & Colors: Ancients has a number of expceptional rules that help make it great, what really makes it stand out among game is the hand management aspect. By providing a random set of cards to the player, they force the individual to build a plan based on the cards, providing immense replayability for any given scenario and testing entirely different skillsets then one would find if the cards were absent. Since I enjoy hand management in general, its presence in this game is a definite plus for me. The other rules simply add to the number of interesting decisions that a player has available, increasing the overall nuances of the game and creating a rich experience that is tough to replicate and almost impossible to beat in games of this class. The variety of scenarios provides even more replayability and fun.

RATING: 9
Players play out tactical ancients battles.  The latest in the Battle Cry/Memoir '44 series sees the same engine driving the troops forward.  This is the most complex of the games to date, with around ten different types of units, all with different abilities in how they move/fire/battle.  The detail is worth it, as this feels like an ancients system.  Light troops harry and disappear, heavies lumber up and pack a punch if they close.  The rules and command cards reward linear tactics, also.  Leaders also are very important now.  The blocks look great, too.  Great addition to the series.

RATING: 9
This is Borg's best design by a wide margin. What sets it apart from the others is the use of leaders and the improved card deck that emphasizes line tactics.  C&C:A does not sacrifice history or strategy to get playability: you really feel the huge impotance of leadership and unit cohesion.
 
I'll admit that there are a couple of downsides here. The game has confusing play aids, cheap dice, and uses wooden bits instead of plastic. But Borg's design really shines through these production glitches. Highest recommendation!

The core mechanics are incredibly similar to Memoir 44, however there is an additional layer of complexity that makes this game far more strategic.

The game IS fun to play once you have the rules properly drilled into your head, however I found the rulebook absolutely terrible at explaining all of the smaller mechanics in a clear and concise way that is also instantly accessible during play. It makes this game a bit of a chore to learn, and even more of a chore to return to if you haven't played it for awhile.

Overall, a well designed game that is let down by a poor rulebook. I'd rather play Memoir 44.

An excellent addition to the C&C line, slightly more complicated than its older brothers. I miss the little plastic bits and superb art direction of Memoir 44, but the wooden blocks are quite classy in their own right, and the art for the counters is very nice.  Its in the rules dept that this game shines. I can't wait for more Ancients: Persians, Greeks, Gauls, Goths and hope that this could be expanded to included medieval battles as well!

Great birthday present! Can't wait to play this! Can wait to put on all the stickers, though.

Update: After 4 plays, I like it pretty good. It's definitely simpler than I expected based on the reputation - seems much more luck-based than I'm comfortable with, so I don't know if I want to play it all the time, but it is fun, and I do enjoy it... I really do like how the game simulates ancient warfare by having slow-moving waves of blocks moving in formation, slowly charging up through the battlefield until they crash through your opponent... or having said opponent draw a Line Command card at the perfect time and going through you like a knife through butter...

Update 2: Can't figure out whether there's much strategy to this or not...

Update 3: I still like it, but this game just doesn't grab me. Feels needlessly complicated for what's a simple game of moving some units and rolling some dice. There's definitely strategy, but no strategy in the world can overcome consistently rolling poorly. Maybe if I'd prefer Memoir, which is at least upfront about what it is, although I know my appetite for simple is meagre.

Update 4: ...And math-traded for an antique Diplomacy set. Even after buying a couple Plano boxes and properly organizing the game, I just rarely felt like playing it.

I must admit that at first I was a bit disappointed that this felt about 90% similar to Mem 44. I knew the two were related, but I thought their would be more differences. I liked Mem 44, but my two least favorite aspects (silly retreat conditions and "trophy hunting" for victory) are still present here.

The components are a mixed bag. Honestly, I think I'd prefer large counters over the wood blocks, and strength markers for hits.  Fewer counters, easier to move and manipulate, lighter weight and less storage space required, and it would bring down the cost considerably. Still, I can see where the wood blocks, while totally cosmetic, will have a wider appeal for a non-wargaming audience. The map is also a mixed bag. While nice and functional, I'd have prefered paper to the carboard, which is slightly warped and doesn't lay flat, even after backfolding. Also, the way they split the cardboard map means it's more likely to rip along the seams than a paper map. Finally, the cardboard is heavier and bulkier, and drives up the production costs.

The cards are decent quality, though nothing special. The art is good, both on units and cards. My cards are not all cut the same- some have rounded corners, and others are lopped off along the right angles. Weird. Still, they shuffle well so it's a very minor gripe.

UPDATE: After spending more time with the game, I can certainly see it's appeal. I like it better than Mem 44, as I think the (nearly identical) rules are a better fit for ancient line-style warfare than a fluid WWII environment. I'm still not crazy about the combat system (ranged combat being the least believable- your chances of doing a hit to a light, medium, heavy, or cav unit are all exactly the same) but I can live with the sacrifices in realism for speed and playability. 

I've now played several ancients systems: GBOH, Simple GBOH, Ancients (3W), C&C: Ancients, and I'd say my very favorite is the Simple GBOH rules set.  For only a marginal increase in complexity, they feel much more realistic than C&C Ancients, and the fun factor is just higher. I also prefer activating by formation and trying to seize the turn rather than the force-you-hand card mechanics. However, there are lot of case where I'd opt to play C&C Ancients over Simple GBOH, especially if playing with someone who is new to wargames, or if time is an issue (although, honestly, many Simple GBOH battles aren't that much longer than the battles here).

Overall I'm pleased that I own this game, and I think games like this fill a nice niche in the hobby- for myself as well as the hobby in general.

UPDATE to UPDATE: As I play more and more, my rating continues to creep upward. This makes a great filler game, or for when time and/or concentration is an issue. And my wife will play it with me repeatedly, which is a real plus in my household.

Finally played my own copy which is why I hadn't rated it earlier (I played someone else's copy a few times ages ago), and I still think that of all the C&C-style games, it is the best one.  The era is fantastic for this system and there's no fiddly-fangly magic!  I had no idea that the original printings didn't come with a player aid - how on earth you manage without one is beyond me.

Still, it's surprising just how much mileage Borg has gotten out of this system.  Though I want to try the Great War, I don't think I'll get a chance to simply because buying into more than one of these systems is just silly.  Each one I try just feels the same and doesn't bring enough to the core mechanics to make them worth owning.

What a step up from Memoir 44. I like this game a lot. I will not state this is a simulation but at least it gives you some tactical options that make sense. Running with one unit to the enemy line will get it killed rather quick. Your best option is to advance as a front and try to raid with your cavalry. Also units that are not defeated or routed will have the chance to do some damage to. 

A minor complaint is that all armies almost feel the same. There are some special rules for some units but part of me would have liked it to be a bit more detailed. But than again, this would make the rules a lot more complicated as well.

The only reason I didn't rate this game a 10 is that I rarely rate any game a 10. That said, this is a true work of art. I'd go so far as to say it's the epitomy of the perfect light, teachable and highly re-playable war game.

I will also point out that both the GMT website and even the box specifically state that this game covers Rome Vs. Carthage, not ALL ancient periods and armies. I noted a couple of comments that the owners felt ripped off because they didn't know that, yet it has been known for literally months and months, even a year, why, maybe more than a year.

Go ahead and buy this game. It's worth every penny and if you really don't like it after you;ve played it you'll have no problem finding many willing traders for your copy here on BGG.

Fair.  Really stretches the boundaries of what is possible with the C&C system, but whether that's good or bad is a toss-up.  There's a point where trying to make a beer-n-pretzels system "deep" reaches highly diminishing returns, and you should just go play something else.

It's probably the best of the system but I have a really hard time getting excited about the Ancients period, or finding players who are excited about it.  Memoir '44 is much easier to get people interested in.  And to teach.

I was thinking of rating it a 3, but then I saw that 2 was defined as "extremely annoying".  I don't regard the cards as a fatal objection, or even the isolated significance of a few die rolls here or there.  Usually the fewer the  units, the bigger the role played by luck.  What annoys me extremely is that sound linear tactics are either unimportant or seriously flawed gameplay.  A coherent formation is not necessary; massing troops against a weakpoint can be very risky; contrary to some of the comments here, good units are not sufficiently better than weak units; and, most importantly, attacking the enemy's rear is actually suicidal. I'm not saying a gamer cannot develop effective tactics for this game, it is just that any knowledge of ancient warfare is likely to be a hindrance to his efforts.

2015-08-10 : Udo Grebe's UGG booth is really the only wargame booth at Spiel and when Richard Borg decided to visit the convention and promote his new game - Command & Colors Ancients - that booth was just the natural place for him to demo and teach his new game.

I made sure I got a spot at the table and was taught the game by the man himself - he's a very nice guy with a good sense of humor and that session with him is one of my most cherished gaming moments.

Years later we played a memorable Command & Colors Ancients game with 28mm ancient armies on Kallistra hex terrain, but that first time remained my best experience with the system.

So I am a huge fan of Richard Borg's games.  I own most of his card driven war games and am a huge fan of Memoir.  I also used to own a lot of the Battlelore Fantasy war version that came out years ago from Days of Wonder.  However, when I purchased Command and Colors, I instantly forgot about Battlelore and have been selling it off in the past year.  Commands and Colors is a bit more complicated than some of his other games but once you catch on, it has a range of depth that is far greater.  It will never replace Memoir as the strategies of WWII do not cross over to the Ancient battles and Borg has been wise to maintain this feeling in his game.  A real classic game that my buddy and I really enjoy playing.

Very cool representation of ancient combat. We take for granted that you can communicate with anyone instantly these days, and the card-driven combat represents a time when there was no instant communication. I would love to play this more but the female won't have any of it. 

More plays have diminished my liking of this game. It's still pretty good, but the set-up and rules are a little more than what I prefer. I would also say that Memoir 44 has a better ratio of rules to strategy than this game offers.

The C&C System works better here than in M'44. The idea of "left flank, right flank, centre" lends itself better to modelling ancients warfare than WWII combat. This at least is a C&C game which I'm willing to give a shot. But C&C:A is still plagued by poor scenario design a la M'44. I mean, some of them are so blatantly unbalanced, just reading the scenario alone, you know who's going to win, let alone actually playtesting them. Surely, the designer or developer could have had different victory banner conditions for each side?

I love this game. More rules and unit types than M44, and in my opinion hugely superior.

Command and Colours is a satisfying light war game. The variety of troops and shifting battle lines make up for the simple combat and objectives.

The order card system, where only a few units are moved at a time, fits nicely with the depth presented by this game.

Setup is lengthly for such a short game, with many pieces. The box offers no sorting options. You will have to get creative.

There are excellent reference cards available on BGG for this game. Check them out!

Looks to be a good deal more tactical than Memoir, with slightly quicker setup time due to the lesser use of terrain tiles. The rules are a bit fiddlier though, and having to use reference charts is something I'm not sure I'm into. I actually like the simplistic art style, but the "board" is laughably bad. Probably won't get to play this much, if at all.

I'm not a fan of the Command & Colors system, but at least this version offers a bit of control and less reliance on the fickleness of the cards with line movement and battle back.

I've played Battle Cry, Mem '44, and this one, and I firmly believe that skill has only a small part to play.  As an example, I played an overlord version of this at Euro Quest VII.  I rolled extremely well and won in a route against the owner of the game (a regular, veteran player). This was my 4th play.  Did I outplay him? No, I rolled really well and had some *great* cards.  That to me sums up this game system.

The setup is immensely time consuming and can take longer than the game. My saying for games like this is: a long drive for such a short journey.

Having played all of the other C & C variants, I have come to appreciate the depth of play offered by Ancients. The tactics of period and the game system are intergrated in a manner that I felt was lacking somewhat in the other versions. An excellent game accessible to all boardgamers.

Compared to memoir'44, even if really similar, this one plays much better for me. It recreates the ancient clash more realistically, and I feel I have more choices in this game even if the "damn I don't have right flank cards" of memoir44 and similar games still strykes in.
Overally I feel this is the better game of the C&C series.

A REALLY GREAT GAME. If you want to win, you have to know how to manage your hand, the characteristics of your units and how to exploit the geography of the battle ground. Leaders are quiet important, their abilities are the key for the victory. As a weak point, graphical design is quite sober, and at the first plays units like Auxilia, Light Infrantry or Sling Infantry can be confused because their similar symbols. Also, sometimes dices have no mercy and other are inoffensive, but at the end one thing offset the other.

This is a great game.  I've played about 7-8 times now and I like it more and more.  Has a great feel, atmosphere, strategy.  Definetely not just a lucky rolls game.  Really it's the first war-like game I have ever played beyond chess or risk.  I love the cardplay, although definetely get deck protectors for these.  I'm fond of the wood blocks.  The board I would have preferred mounted, but with plexiglass it's OK.  The dice are awful, but I bought Doom dice, painted them black, color copies and trimmed the stickers, and then clear coated and they are real nice now.  I have mixed feelings about the expansions - I kind of like it and am excited, but I don't like the idea that I have to spend another $40-45 to get an expansion.  I'd like the game to be able to use the components I already have and support it more in terms of releasing expansions.  Perhaps I'm asking for generic bits and that would reduce the atmostphere.  But I'm not sure I want to sticker and pay for another 300+ blocks.  Anyway, great game.

An improvement over the original design of Memoir '44.  The added complexity adds decisions in battle and that is much appreciated.  I can see this engine yielding tons and tons of scenarios; striking a good playable balance will be interesting to explore.  An odd change that I think was actually a reduction from M'44 is the lack of objective control.  So much importance was attached to holding a key part of the battlefield, even in the ancient times, that I find it weird to remove that part of the game.  Especially because it tends to encourage situations where advantage is gained through mad dashes to reduced units.  Never mind how incohesive your line becomes or hoow dispersed your units are across the battlefield.  Strange but not a showstopper.

My first game designed by Richard Borg.  I haven't purchased or tried Memoir 44 yet.  The reviews are outstanding and I love a good quick 2-player war game, so I'm looking forward to getting a lot of use from this game.

I'm going to give the out-of-the-box infamous dice a chance and use them for a while.

Putting all the stickers on the wooden blocks was one heck of  a chore.  I had the whole family sitting around the kitchen table helping.

Not as fast and furious as Memoir '44, but definitely a meatier and more robust game.  I love the variety of tactical options, as well as  the importance of leaders and maintaining a line, the latter of which is especially well simulated.  Once you get the right command cards, you'll need spend a few turns setting up your forces to make one or two big moves. 

Bonus - my wife loves it, despite her dislike of Memoir.  The big differences were: 1) the theme, and 2) options on defense (Battle Back, Evade, etc).

EDIT: Received a set of Valley Games dice from Hawkeye77 for Christmas 2008!  Thank you!

RATING: 10
 I'm glad I have this game and I love the wooden blocks.  I think my interest in it is hurt from playing lots of historical miniatures with loads of beautiful scenery.  The game play is fun and fast and the end can really swing with the cards and dice!  If it just had a more interesting game board it would make me want to set it up more often.  As good as the battles are, I'm left wishing the game had a small campaign system to flesh things out a bit and link the rewards of one battle to the next. Still, I'd recommend this game for it's great 'miniatures' feel.

Update: This game and it's Greek add-on has become my favorite light wargame. And 'light wargame' Is a hard niche for me to fill- I can't think of another game that is this fun and this fast.  It's a great game to play with eurogamers when you have a two player session.   I've been playing it on the Battlelore board just to have a mounted board.   It would rate higher but sometimes it feels like a battle is over before it got started.  At times I've felt like the setup took longer that the battle.

Final Thoughts: I'd rate it higher but it bugs me that this simple wargame can't adapt to three or four players.  Its short playtime  would make it a natural for multiplayer nights but the Command and Colors system (one hand of cards per side) doesn't scale up very well.  One guy holding the cards and telling a team mate what to do isn't really multi player.  Same for Battlelore.  I wish team mates could each have a hand of cards and some good decisions, like a miniatures game would do with split commands.

Update:  Ok, it's the only light wargame that I've found that I really like. I admit I'm picky about light wargames.  The complete system is really nice when you add up the variety of armies and scenarios.  The blocks, artwork and finally mounted boards push this simple game over the top.  Beautifully developed by GMT.  I only wish they included extra decks in the expansions, so you could jump in anywhere.

CCA is surely one of my all time favorits. It has the prime thing I want in a game - Theme! Every scenario I play I tend to study what really happened historically in some depth. 
Of course the game offers a very simplified simulation of reality and mainly focus on playability, but I still can close my eyes and feel the historical weight of my decisions on the battlefield. 
The gaming mechanism is superb, both realistic and very simple, allowing smooth playing and most of all enabling games duration of up to an hour, which is wonderful for a game of this type.

RATING: 8
Two player wargame lite. It's hex based for postioning, card driven for orders and dice rollin' for determining outcomes.

It sounds boring but is in fact a great game and there is a lot of fun to be had. Nice bit of historical background provided with each of the scenarios, which made me want to read more about the period.

Plays fairly rapidly once you get the rules down and there is enough variety in the units provided to allow for different tactics but not so much variety that you've constantly got your head stuck in the rule book - a nice balance.

RATING: 8
Great game. Similar to M'44, but a couple of nicer additions. You don't need all three (M'44, C&C:A and Battlelore), since they all scratch the same itch. I would go with any of the latter two, since the system is more "developed" in them. Personnally I prefer C&C:A for more control and for the theme, but if you prefer a fantasy world, you may be better with Battlelore.

Excellent! I'm very happy with this new piece of refreshig air to my collection! Random aspects of this game does not bother me at all, instead, I think these aspects add variety and excitement to the game experience! I really love how they look on the game board all those little blocks with stickers on both sides. If you are a serious war gamer, then maybe this game is not for you, but if you simply are someone who wants to play a very funny, easy to learn but also strategic to win, war game, this is a must have for you!

If you like the system devised by Richard Borg for Battle Cry and Memoir'44 set in the Ancients era (Roma, Carthago and the likes) you surely will like as I do. It would become great if you would have miniatures instead of the blocks!!
Anyway it is a clearly winner for me!!

RATING: 8
I like the system used in this light wargame. It's still one where the dice have a lot of say but the clever card system means you have to think about formations and battle order, too, because bad preparation can reduce your odds considerably. With the cards you also cannot always do what you'd like to do, and while that certainly does limit your options a good deal it adds some tension to the game as you never know what commands your opponent has at his disposal. "If I expose my flank here for some quick hit-and-run will he be able to take advantage of it?"
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I don't understand the huge success of this game. I don't think it looks gorgeous, nor the map or the blocks stickers. Games are fast and dynamic. Not quite realistic. A unit composed only by one block is able to shoot as if it was complete...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
My first rating was when I didn't realize you could battle back...I felt kinda dumb for that. This is definitely a pretty sweet game with tons of strategy that takes less than an hour, I just wish the setup didn't feel like it took an hour too. Rolling dice as much as this game requires is still a bit annoying. Most dice rolling is to me.

Only four games so far and I'm liking it a lot. The rules are not overwhelming, but the game feels quite authentic. (At least to someone with no wargame experience at all.)
What I like so far is that it takes a reasonable amount of time, and the theme really draws me in. (Which happens rarely with other games. Here the mechanics fit really well without overcomplicating things.) My main concern is the luck factor, as both the cards and the dice add a lot of it. I didn't have any bad luck so far, but I think I was incredibly lucky a few times. (So my rating could be very different if I had sat on the other side of the table.) Anyway, this may not be a big problem, more plays will show.

The game plays similar (not surprisingly) to the other games in the C&C system. The addition of a few more rules has a surprisingly deep effect on how the game plays out.  The emphasis on maintaining coherent lines of battle shines through here and is period appropriate.  Each game produces a nice bit of story and one can almost see the great waves of men crashing upon each other as you play.  Production is nice, the blocks have a nice feel and evoke the period well.

RATING: 8
Super game for a niche in my wargame collection, that being games playable in an hour (or less).  Even with a short play time it provides a tense interesting experience and provides the feel of an ancients simulation.
I think the blocks with diverse stickers are quite good bits, better than generic toy soldiers of limited variation which would be monochrome such that detail cannot be seen anyway.

RATING: 9
This is the top game in the C&C genre of games (that is, compared with Battlelore and M'44). It has all of the wonderful core mechanics of those games but adds enough extra mechanics to think about and that truly brings what is a brilliantly designed dice game into a level that could compete with any solidly constructed wargame. Somewhat frustrated by the number of rule layers and exceptions there are, but once you get passed that you have one of the more thoughtfully designed hex-and-counter games ever created.  Brilliant balance of strategy and tactics.

It's very good how the tactics completely differ from Memoir '44 - in C&C:A you're thinking about keeping your line together, keeping your leaders in the thick of the battle, and there really is reason to be scared of the heavy troops. I think the map and the dice suck, but the box and the blocks and the rule book are excellent.

RATING: 7
This is my favorite of the Commands & Colors Series.  It may even become my first '10' ranked game in the future, but I need to get in more plays before I can give it that rating.  I like all the other games in the series, but I feel this one focuses on the elements of the system I like the most.  

I particularly like the way that units in melee always "battle back" unless they are eliminated or forced to retreat and how units generally retreat just as quickly as they advance which makes cavalry very fragile when on the defensive.

There are lots of other things about this game that I love (leaders, elephants, cards, etc.) but those two simple tweaks to the system just seem to make it play a lot more interestingly.

The best game in the Command and Color series. The evolution of this system is fun to follow. It is not as quick playing as Battle Cry or Memoir '44 but the extra complexity makes the game more interesting.  I feel that the system works best with this type of warfare. The pace of carnage in a Memoir '44 scenario makes many games over before much a plan develops whereas in Ancients, without mech units or artillery every unit must put themselves in danger to cause damage and formation and leadership is key.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.7
As an ancients wargame that gives you a feel for how different troops behave and interact, it's not GBoH, but it does so relatively quickly.  However, I find the focus on eliminating units to lead to some weird behavior.  There's less focus on flanking the enemy or breaking up their lines than figuring out where to put the boot in and chasing down stragglers.

The blocks kept me away for a long time - then a math trade intervened & I'm now the proud owner of my FOURTH Command & Colors game. (Richard Borg is independently based on my gaming budget alone.) 

Anyway, one play in and I'm happier with the blocks than I thought I would be & intrigued by the way a few small rule changes helps make the players fight like ancient generals.

I respect the ideas behind this game, and I like the amount of strategy over Memoir 44. But the components really messed it up for me.

After playing BattleLore I got interested in the differences C&C had to offer.  Being interested in the historical aspects of war I found that C&C could offer a little more for me to learn in that area.  I also found that the play was different enough with leaders, evade, etc. that it would be worth owning this as well as BL.  It is different enough from BL that I can enjoy playing it as much but similar enough I did not have to learn an entirely new set of rules and game system.  Another great game by Mr. Borg.

This is my first war game I have really enjoyed. The price is too high (the only reason I did not give the game a 9) for such a poor quality board.

This is another one of those games where I can't see where ANY of the gushing praise is coming from.

The game stops being historical after the initial setup. Unstoppable Heavy infantry end up hunting down scattered units to get that last victory banner while the rest of the armies just stand there. It is not that uncommon to have plenty of cards in your hand that are worthless. Retreat rules are lame.
Facing (which was enormously key in real battles) is not even dealt with.
Your unit composition, the initial setups and card draw leave you little 
room for meaningful decisions; most are essentially made for you.

So not only is it ahistorical, but it is not very good as a game.
Before you buy the hype, try a few games before committing to buy this.

Love the morale, the "line" and battleback concepts make this a great game but the components kill it.  Sadly the hours I spent attaching the stickers were not very fun.

I have never played a block and hex wargame before but I have played miniatures wargames. I bought this because of the good reviews it was getting and my interest in the period.  Have now played four games and, although its subtleties are still emerging, already I think it's a great game. The card driven system produces some tough choices and the combination of leader effects and mechanics such as momentum advance, battle back and bonus close combats make for some really exciting game play. Highly recommended, but don't be suprised to find it's tough to win with the historically disadvantaged force.

RATING: 8
Probably the most well known of the Command & Colours series of games. The command card play provides both "fog of war" and supply/logistics/command difficulty. The rules are very well written and laid out. The interaction of the many troop types is well balanced and gives a good feel of ancient warfare although this is more of a game than a simulation - but a very good game. Scenarios are plentiful and the game is supported by many online resourses. Components are excellent - I like the blocks - and can be pimped with miniatures and 3d terrain for a great look if you want that extra visual appeal.
 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game is amazing.  It gives you a quick game with randomness but the battlefield actually feels like it's flowing on the board.  It's one of those games where a good game with two good players will have points where you feel like you're headed out of the game and then some heroic maneuvers later the opponent has the same experience.

Could use a few more scenarios in the book, though, IMO.

Regrade:  I still find myself playing, still great light game, would recommend it to others in a second.  Even over its other sexier plastic Borg system brothers.  This is way deeper and more interesting than even battlelore with the leadership system.  It should get its due despite its non-euro gamer/ATer production.  I can't imagine someone liking Battlelore more than this game, but to each his own...

But for me, there are other games I'd rather be playing.  I guess I'm just at heart a heavier game player and wargamer.  I'll stick with 7.5 for now.

Tentative rating and is the same rating as Battlelore.  I am in debate still as to which one I prefer as both games have some good and bad with them.  The production is fancier in Battlelore and the iconography is clearer.  Then again, I like the blocks in C&C:A, but the pictures on them can be hard to tell apart.  I like the idea of expansions with C&C:A versus Days of Wonder's decision to go the collectible crapulence route.

This has turned out to be a perfect solitaire game for me, which I know is not typical of wargamers. It's fairly simple, and only an hour long so it fits nicely into my attention span at night. And it has lots of scenarios so it's not getting stale so far -- I don't record solo plays but I'm into double digits. I don't mind playing both sides, and have learned a lot about ancient battles. I much prefer this to the "puzzle" type of solitaire-only game, like Ambush or Field Commander.

RATING: 8
A more complex Memoir '44. It's definitely not as approachable with newbies though. There are many more units, some of the iconography is confusing. Overall, a better, more complex ruleset, the scenarios are great. This is what adults play while the kiddies play M'44.

Hundreds of wooden blooks to glue, a bunch of cards and several dice. And of course, one of the best rules in the market. This is Command and Colors. Base game is good but not superb, however with epic rules it becomes a winner. A wonderful option for two players (I dont really like multiplayer epic). It is expensive to have the whole collection and the components are not top noch, but the game worths the bucks in my opinion. Love this game: fast, easy and with room for tactical manouvers and beautiful components. Very good stuff, I rate its normal version with an eight and the Epic one with a nine.

Just picked this up yesteday and I am not impressed with a few thigns.  First off the cost, this cost me as much as a Fantasy Flight big box game like Starcraft or Descent.  That would be cool if the components justified the cost but they don't.  Sure there are over 300 wooden blocks, but I have to manually add a sticker to each side of each one, that's 600 stickers to attach myself.  Even ignoring that, the game board is on thick card and is unmounted, which besides being of poor quality is hard to get to even lay flat.  The dice don't even come with symbols on them, you have to put stickers on those too.  The cards for play are thin and I'm going to be putting them in card condoms right away.  Now I read the rules and have read enough reviews to know this should be a great game, but man after playing Battlelore it just seems so cheaply made, and it costs almost $40 more!

This is a Trojan Horse of light gaming in a "serious" package and at least [i]Memoir '44[/i] wasn't pretending to be serious. The system is fine in a WWII game, but here it fails to capture ancient warfare. It is brutally inaccurate. 80,000 Romans fought at Cannae but you'd never know from the set up in this game. Fortunately the battles are balanced enough to make most games close.

Commands & Colors: Ancients is a masterpiece of game design.  It's also exactly the sort of tactical wargame I want to play at this point in my gaming life: a variable, dramatic game with meaty, subtle decisions without the burden of complex rules or a long play time.  I wouldn't have suspected that Borg's Commands and Colors game engine could produce a game of this depth.  Memoir '44 and Battle Cry were fun, lighthearted games.  But they didn't feel like consim games.  C&C:Ancients does feel like a consim.  It's a skillful game, a thought-provoking game, and a game that really does feel like an ancients battle!

The game is so good that I like to play a scenario four times in one sitting if we have time.  I prefer to increase the number of flags required for victory by one to give to give the battles a little more time to play out.

Greg taught me this at AGE; played one game-- it was a bit rough, cause he was struggling to remember the rules, but got enough of a sense of the flow of the pieces, and potential tactics to want to try it again after reviewing the rules a bit more.

I very much like this game. I have played and enjoyed all of Mr. Borg's published games using this system, but this is the first time (along with Battlelore) I felt that the mechanics weren't fighting the theme. Gives a good feel for ancient warfare, and the decisions I'm making as a commander seem to approximate what a leader in the field would have to consider. I especially like the way the leadership and support rules combine to encourge players to keep their units together; once you lose order in your line, the cost of ordering your units goes up in subtle ways, and you'll find your troops starting to retreat where they might otherwise stand fast and battle back. Terrific. Rating has climbed steadily through over a dozen playings; I genuinely love this game.

RATING: 6
Played 10+ times  I enjoy seeing my 14 year old getting so much pleasure from this game. His enthusiasm for the game exceeds my own. As with Memoir 44 I find the game to be a rather hollow experience. It must have taken me 6 hours to put on the stickers and learn the rules throughout this time I was regretting I had brought it but once I had got through the process my mood lightened mainly because my son likes it so much. I prefer the blocks to figures because they are easier to sort out and put on the board but then again I would be quiet happy with coloured cubes representing the different units (I am such a "Euro-head"). I am not aware of making any "clever" decisions during the course of a game. This game is more about the feel and the atmosphere and I can't fault it on this score. We play at speed and once set up the battle breaks out before us going through beginning, middle and end at the sort of pace you expect from a video game rather than a board game. March 07

I like this game. 
I like the blocks that give you the idea of tightly knit formations. I LOVE the elephants. 
Troops are very different and varied that make for different strategies. Luck factor is not-so-good, but if dice do not favor anyone too much the game is enjoyable. 
Maybe in the epic - which I haven't played yet- version things are a little less random.

UPDATE
This gets boring fast. I really cannot see any appeal to this other than use the pieces to play Lost Battles.

RATING: 9.5
The research I did before buying into this one was time well spent. It's exceeded my expectations. I'm amazed at how much tactical depth and simulation of real ancient battlefield situations it packs into its simple, elegant rules. Much is made of the randomness of card draw and dice rolls by the game's (few) detractors but these criticisms miss the point. It's all about good hand management, timing and using probablity to your favour, and consistently rewards careful planning and tactical play appropriate to the period. With its quick playtime, ancients theme, great replayability and high fun quotient this one is a real winner with me. Prefer face to face but the Vassal module is a neat alternative when I can't get it on the table. 

Updated October 2011: After many, many more plays through most of the published scenarios (many replayed multiple times) plus Scenario X, both on the table and Vassal, this is without a doubt my favourite game for regular play. Always up for a game, any time, anywhere.

Similar to Memoir 44, but less terrain and more rules to memorize with all the different infantry types & ranged vs close combat. Would like to play more but my opponents prefer Memoir 44. And I can see why.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Just awesome. A fairly light game that can throw up some really fascinating strategic and tactical situations. Fried gold, as they say. It never seems to get boring, as the scenarios (across the various expansions) keep the game really varied, and most of them are worth playing many times. It's also really easy to play, but comes up with convincing historical outcomes (the system was extensively play-tested over a long period of time, and it shows).

I don't ever give a rating of 10 lightly, in any field, but this game truly deserves it.

August 2015: it's still ace. For me, this game hits the sweet spot of depth versus complexity. It's pretty simple, but provides difficult decisions, but it doesn't overwhelm you with options.

RATING: 7.75
Initial rating of 7.25

My chronological Commands and Colors history:
Battle Cry then Mem 44 then BattleLore now CC Ancients.

I would have to say that even though I am a WWII goof and I also like fantasy combat, CC Ancients is the best of the bunch. Ancients warfare isn't even of all that much interest to me

Q: All of these games are the same core system, right?

A: Yes.

Q: OK, so how is it that you can like CC Ancients more than Mem 44 or BattleLore since they have a theme you much prefer?

A: Well, Mem 44 is just too light for me when it comes down to WWII. I came up playing much heavier games on this subject and I like more detail than Mem 44 provides. That and I just cant help feel that the game mechanics were forced to cover WWII, they just don't feel quite right for the time period.

For me, BattleLore is a really fun game (other than the crappy goblin rules) and the mechanics feel proper for the theme. However, when compared to CC Ancients BattleLore is "flashy" and can be a bit gimmicky and a bit more dependent upon luck.

Q: What is it exactly you like more about CC Ancients?

A: The mechanics feel perfect for this theme. Compared to other Commands and Colors games, the play is a bit more refined and focused which gives it a more "gritty" feel. I walk away feeling much more satisfied in terms of a good tactical fight instead of lamenting hot dice or who got their gimmick to work first.

I've loved this game for a long time, finally got it.

First comment: wood. I love wooden components, even if they're little stickered wooden blocks. There's something about wood that makes the game so much more important and real.

Second comment: manuals and box. Beautiful. The box is probably the sturdiest box in my entire collection. The manuals, while a little dense at times, get the point across clearly.

Third comment: fun. Anything ancient has my attention, and just looking over the scenario list had me salivating five years ago. Who wouldn't be thrilled with the chance to replay Trebbia or Trasimene?

Two reasons this doesn't get a ten:

 - It doesn't take much effort to get custom dice printed these days. The stickered plastic dice feel prototype-ish.

 - The stickers. I have a love/hate relationship with them. I love the idea that I could get some blank blocks and do up a couple of custom armies and refight any ancient battle I want to. But after 2 hours of stickering my hands hurt!

All in all, my only regret is that I didn't get this several years ago.

RATING: 8
Initial rating.  Seems overly complex for what it is.  

Components:

Representing a unit's hitpoints by individual blocks seems wasteful, and really increases bulk, setup time, and cost.  A columbia-style rotating block would create the same effect with a quarter of the materials, and I would even prefer a flippable counter to this.  Graphics on the individual foot units are tough to distinguish, resulting in a lot of board squinting as moves are planned.  Again, a single larger rotating block or large flippable counter would solve this problem.

Especially for a 3rd edition, the rulebook is poorly done.  Typos abound, and it lacks an index, or even a table of contents.

Gameplay:

Fine as a game, but it doesn't strike me as particularly realistic or historic (though I am certainly no expert in ancient warfare).  My least favorite aspect of the game is that the basic rules (victory points are only scored by eliminating opponents' units and leaders) and the C&C left-center-right line-warfare system really constrain the scenarios that can be played.  Essentially every scenario has to be two lines of fighters bashing each other.  No escape-for-victory or siege scenarios are possible, for example, because killing opposing units is the only thing that matters for a win.  So it's a line warfare game where killing opposing units is the only goal.  Ok.  I'll just have to be resigned to that and hope it accomplishes this rather specific goal very well.

There are a lot of unit types, many of which are very similar, and I'm not sure the variety adds enough to the gameplay to warrant the extra complexity.  It doesn't seem plausible that the various units are only there for historic realisticity, because there are many unrealistic things about the game.  For example:  Why do units attack at full strength even if they are almost eliminated?  What is this, Street Fighter II?

I'm not really seeing where all the hype for this one is coming from.  I'll stick with it for a while and see if my opinion improves.

Update: Ok, this game is growing on me.  Bumped up rating.

Very fun, light wargame. However, I have serious doubts that this is better--or even as good as--BattleLore. Sure, it's more historical, but that doesn't really turn my crank. It has two serious faults next to BL; first, it has too many troop types for its own good, which contributes to rules creep and detail fatigue. Second, since support is less important, so too are formations--leader movement just isn't as interesting for me in comparison.
Also, I have heard that scenarios are about as balanced as those of Memoir--which is to say, not at all. Time will tell.

Great game that seems to nail the ancient period!  Love it.  Even though you can see all of your opponents' pieces, it may not help depending on what cards you pull.  Battle lines, morale, fog of war, etc. are all modeled well in the end result if not necessarily the mechanism (in other words, the battles play out like an ancient battle should, but the card playing, dice rolling, and block removal aren't perfect simulations of ancient combat).  

The stickering of the hundreds of blocks is a gamer rite of passage, as well.  Something everybody should do at least once.

RATING: 7
From the same school as Battle Cry and Memoir 44.  A good light introduction to wargaming, and plays quickly enough to play both sides in one session.

Introduces the concepts of battling back and evading which make for a better game.  Very important to use leaders wisely, since many cards active the leader and adjacent troops.  So having an isolated leader reduces the number of troops that can be activated.

One play. The distinction between units is not very intuitive. This results in players continuously refering to a spreadsheet. Unlike C&C cousin, Memoir '44, which has very intuitive differences in the units.

This implementation of the C&C system fixes most of the gripes I had about memoir.  The system really fits with this era of warfare.  Fantastic game.  The blocks, stickers, terrain, and player aids look wonderful.  The board is functional as long as you have some plexiglass to put it under.  Seems to have good replay value as long as you can find new scenarios or buy expansions.  The rulebook is extremely well written.  This one's a real gem.  Definitely superior to all the previous C&C incarnations and on par with battlelore, though it clearly offers some very different things from BL.  I recommend it to folks who didn't think Memoir offered them enough and who don't want to get with the battlelore craze.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Main complaint is the unbalanced scenarios. I know we're supposed to play a scenario multiple times and see who 'wins better', but it seems to me like it could've been fixed a little by giving each side a different victory point goal. Other than that, great game.

Fast playing, card driven, tactical wargame. Light and enjoyable, healthy amount of thinking necessary to prevail, yet luck has significant role on the outcome. It is fun and exciting dynamic to first plan little strategies/maneuvres based on few cards and then witness the outcome unraveling. Also fun in a different way to get surprised by opponent (or horrible dice roll). Two thumbs up.

This game also makes my C3i magazines more valuable since there are scenarios released on a regular basis.

RATING: 6
What to say?
Yes, it is an improvement. Game type works fine for something like an accurate feeling (something I missed very much in M'44).
What disappoints me... for example we played also scenario 2 yesterday. The game was over, before it really began. Seriously - it took us longer to set it up. Don't ask me... 10 to 15 minutes all in all.
Does this bother?
Not basically - but when you had hardly any INTERESTING DECISSIONS within a game, it does.
After 5,6 cards the game was over. There was no real IDEA I had during playing it. When I played the last card, I knew that it was for the moment the last card to activate my heavy units. There was no reason to play a different card to keep the opportunity for activating this units a little later. Played it, was lucky with the dice roll, won.

Still a wargame to play with non-wargamers.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Awesome.  Captures theme well, plays great.  High tension, I stress over the decisions to be made and I love it.  I didn't find the "card action" limiting at all, in fact I thought it modeled the problems in communication during an ancient battle perfectly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very strong ancients system that does a more than admirable job of modeling period warfare, while at the same time keeping rules load low. In fact, I think it might be an even better simulation of ancient warfare than the far more involved and time-consuming GBoH games. 

A great game to play through a number of scenarios in succession. The only downside is the amount of time required for set-up. Also works very well on Wargameroom, opposed or solo.

Having played through most of the scenarios in the base game and the first expansion, I'm looking forward to the Spartans soon, and the other (sadly out of print) expansions down the line.

RATING: 5
Below average: CDG Tactical - Ancient - Easy 

Ahhh,I'm so frustrated as I really love many aspects of the game but what pulls this down:
-1 block units role with full dice (yes I know it is morale related but still I can't get over it)
-Swing of luck just too much for me (I like excitement but it is just too frustrating for me) 
-No battle back; hey you wack me and if I have a card I wack back next turn...

Plus:
-Accessible
-Replay value
-Time
-Components
-Modular nature 
-Various unit types 
-Loads of scenario's

Minus:
1) Attacking units are able to damage / eliminate units without the possibility of battling back for the unit in question, even a 1 unit block can create havoc; hits in combination with a flag are deadly. Often too powerful imo. This is also the reason why I can't love Meoir '44. I desperately want to love it but I can't overcome this issue and I depirately hope C&C:Napoleonics has the right answer.

2) I know that a 1 unit block represents a unit that is close of breaking, however, the fact that a 1 unit block fights as a 4 unit block in battle is something I have not overcome. Worse, I got more annoyed by it over time.

3) The combinations of the card / dice mechanic is really clever, however, a combination of bad cards with a bad role can mean disaster in one round. 
I know luck evens out but frankyl spaeking this does not occur in playing one scenario. It happend too often that a well played single scenario was decided by dice / cards.
Maybe this is realistic but not for my tastes. I prefer a bit less chaos. Chaos can be fun but I get a feeling here it is sometimes too much, WAY too much;

4) I found decision making rather obvious. Managing Chaos is one thing, manging luck another but too often (not always) I felt it did hardly matter what I was doing as it went all right or all wrong (dice / card combo).

5) Map is too small for my tatstes

Easy set up and played with interesting choices and a lot of luck: cards + dice.
However, timing, risk management and flexibility have more influence on your fortunes than it might appear. LUCK meets SKILL and it is all about timing: 
-when to attack where
-which card to use when
-knowing when to take a risk and when not
-stay flexible all the time

Sold it.

Although I was really well educated in the the worlds of ancient greeks & romans (mostly greeks), I never before showed a big interst in their wars.
This game seems to have changed it all. It should reflect ancient warfare pretty good, while at the same times introduces a flexible/fluent game which can be played within 1/1,5 hours.
It looks like it's playable with non-wargaming (girl)friends, which helps to bring the game to the table more often.

Sessions:

Played quite some games and although it is a nice game, the dice throw me off a little.
Playing certain scenario's (mostly the bigger ones) this will level out nice (try Bagradas!!!lovely), but on the smaller scenario's 2 or 3 bad dice rolls can really screw up your game.

If you enjoy this game and want to move up: Try SPQR

Predecessor of the Memoir'44 (M44) and Battlelore (BL). Bit more complex and therefor bit more tactical options, but IMO Memoir and Battlelore deliver better overall experience because of the better quality components, but I can see why some people prefer this over M44 or BL.

2013-02-21: Whoa, such a simple system with such vast tactical possibilities. Of course, the dice are very important, and so is what cards you get, and that might well play a big role in who wins, and the scenarios aren't all balanced at all - but that doesn't matter when you can just play two or three games in a row.

This was my only 10 for a while, and I've played it lots solo, finally found a playing partner that liked it as well. When we discussed a few games of ours and found that it might have been luck that decided the winner in those matches, it took a bit of a hit. But it's still great.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I think this is a great introductory game and a tonic for the jaded.  As in all the CC iterations (Battle Cry, Memoir 44, Battlelore), game play is very fast and usually intense.  I've played very few games that did not come down to a final turn with critical card play and dice rolls.  The beauty of this system is that it is easy enough to teach to a novice and they can do well with a little common sense play, but it is also interesting for a grognard, especially when time for a game is at a premium.  I think the main thing to bear in mind with all the CC games is that they really are games and not simulations.  However, that is not a fault and I really enjoy this game when I am looking for a competitive game that is lighter in rules content and time requirements.  The components are good, in particular the rulebook and the player aid card which is excellent.  The map and hex tiles are functional, but no more than that. Applying the stickers to the blocks is an exercise in tedium.  Frankly, I would rather pay $20 more to have that done by GMT.

Love this game system. Takes the Columbia block idea and adds it's own twists. Nice production. Loads of blocks. Great fun to play. Like the idea of being able to play large scale Roman Civil War battles. Need to get this to the table more. Recently bought C&C Expansion 2 & 3 to add to the gaming fun!

Memoir 44 advanced.  The Commander adds a lot to the game, and I love those line moves!  Unfortunately I need to remember that Cavalry should be kept in reserve, and used to eliminate a weak unit.  The Infantry was the Queen of the battlefield back then, and it is well modeled in this game!

Slightly more complex than Memoir'44. This game is perfect as an entry level wargame.

Just played this game for the first time. I love it just as much as I love M'44. I am looking forward to the campaign expansion. I like that the design is enough to be familiar but not so familiar that it is the same game. 

The blocks are nice. The cards and board have a nice antique color. The quality of this game is magnificent. There is even a nice little historical intro to the battles.

This is a card-driven wargame that uses the same system as Memoir '44 but it is a step up in complexity.  The learning curve is steeper but I really like the addition of Leaders to the game.  I like this game better than Memoir '44, though initially putting stickers on all the blocks took forever.  I would have waited for BattleLore instead if I had known it was coming.

Finally got C+C:A to the table; why I waited so long I cannot say because this is a very good game.

C+C:A is Borg's Classical time period implementation of the ruleset from Battle Cry with GMT.  It is a highly thought of but minimalist game, with several sizes of double-stickered wooden blocks for the troop units (no fog of war there), combat dice and a deck of command cards to both allow and limit troop movements.

Other than the thin cardboard board this is a hefty game, with most of the box space occupied by wooden units. It's a classy but straightforward style that fits well with the generally classy games GMT puts out.

The play is simple enough even on a first read, and while there are certainly a couple of rules that sent me back to the rules midgame (e.g, Leader attacks/evasions) it was not especially hard to find what I needed and get back to the game.

The first scenario seems unbalanced in favor of the Syracusan forces, but the play was straightforward, simple enough to setup and get started playing, and the hardest part was identifying units.  Compared to a set of hundreds or even thousands of cardboard chits this is a mere quibble.

Because there is some luck involved with the command cards, there is a variable luck element beyond mere strategy.  The implementation of unit activations and change of player turns was fast and efficient, and the game flows nicely with little downtime or maintenance.

The scenarios are plentiful and varied, mostly covering the 2nd Punic War, and of course there are several expansions available for this game as well.

I liked the game- I can see why folks would go to Plano boxes for this, but other than learning to recognize the units better and backfolding the map before play I have nothing to complain of.

On a first solo play (1st scenario) I'm giving this smooth wargame with many Euro virtues a 7.25 with room to grow.  This games does everything it tries to do pretty darn well; it's no wonder this is top 25 material.

Now, why DID I wait so long to get this out?

Intriguing game is in essence simplified figure gaming on a board, using blocks for the generic troops.  It is a highly stylised form of 'military chess' and won't give a lot of insight into its subject beyond the basic interrelationships between the units.  But, it is short, exciting and fun, and very nicely produced, and will see more play.

Utility note:  I originally had this (and [i]Greece & Eastern Kingdoms[/i]) in tackle boxes like you see in the image gallery, but once we actually started playing I bagged everything.  Bags are really much more convenient for storage, setup and breakdown.

(Upgraded with the [gameid=138441] & two sets of Valley Games' replacement wooden dice—[i]very nice.[/i]  Also threw in a bunch of red glass beads to act as unit activation markers.)*

[imageid=154488 small]

[size=18][b]*[/b][/size]

[size=7]Mounted board:  I was perfectly cool with the one that came with the game, as it felt appropriately thematic to have a "paper" map to go with the wooden blocks, but repeat plays highlighted the negatives—too easy to bump and move, and it wouldn't lay flat, causing terrain to slip around.  (A plexiglass sheet, while utilitarian, broke the "pre-battle strategy session in a sandy tent" feel for me, and I'm a pig for thematic immersion.)  The mounted board is much, much nicer.

Wooden dice:  The plastic dice that come with the game are just plain godawful.  For ancients warfare I want a [i]wood-paper-stone[/i] experience—not the [i]touched-a-bug[/i] sensation of Chinese polymers.  Curiously, one set of these has matte ink for all faces except the leader while the other set is apparently done up in "disco blaze" with sparkly ink for all unit faces.[/size]

I've played twice now, the first two scenarios.  I understand that the designer was hoping to simulate what happened in reality, but what fun is it to know you are set up to lose?  I played the carthegians both times, and both times got kicked around the field.  Doesn't really make me want to go out and spend another 40 bucks for the expansions.

UPDATE:  I've played a few more of the scenarios, and they have balanced out a little toward the middle of the scenario page.  I should check out the fan made ones, those might be fun (and unbalanced, but I'll risk it).

I must admit I've never really understood the fascination some have with ancient warfare. OK, Alexander and Hannibal were cool and the variety of troop types is unmatched in any later era of history, but this is an age where battle tactics consisted of nothing more sophisticated than lining up and charging. The card-driven system captures this chaotic feel very well, but the game's objectives are quite artificial in that winning requires only the killing of a certain number of opposing units. So success consists of safeguarding your own depleted units where possible, and finishing off those of your opponent. This, together with the inevitably close finish inherent in a battle of attrition makes the ending feel quite arbitrary and unsatisfactory.

First new boxed game I bought in at least 13-14 years, after having purged a fair number of my boxed wargames due to space. Just got it Feb 2009, while on vacation with my wife. She even helped sticker the blocks - and there's a lot of them! It took several hours over a couple sittings to get them all done.

It was definitely worth it, though. I played a couple games, and can tell already it's a real keeper. The game plays cleanly and very quickly. I can see it's going to be extremely replayable, too. 

The score would be higher, but I need to wait and see how its true staying power will turn out to be.

I can definitely see an expansion or two coming my way at some point on the horizon...

More playings later - and this is definitely a new classic! Nevertheless I'm not certain the expansions are really necessary. Probably at least 1 of them at some point.

Well after over a year, I can say this has become a personal favorite! Average playing time is less than an hour. To really speed setting this up, you will need to get some sort of storage system to separate the different playing pieces. Beautiful components, and great fun to play! This is without doubt a must-buy game.

RATING: 9
Initially can be frustrating, until you work out how to effectively to mitigate the luck. The same is true of the different unit types; Light Cavalry, for example, are difficult to deploy effectively until you understand their capabilities (as a missile firing screen, they can be great - ask Crassus c. 53 BC for how historical that is). Once you see how things fit together, then it's a fun and at least vaguely historical-feeling game. It's not GBoH, but nor is it trying to be. The advantages are the quick play time and the reasonable balance on most of the scenarios (in the base game at least). Over time, and multiple plays, the better player will usually win, although individual scenarios can be swingy.
The scenario X rules available on the CCAncients web site are an interesting addition, which basically port DBA army lists onto the CCA system. Some interesting match ups can be made that way, which are usually pretty balanced (if you choose the right terrain for your army), adding to the longevity.
I'd like to try the expansions: the Roman Civil Wars are the period I'm most interested in historically, but I hear there may be balance problems there (which is excusable in a more detailed system, but in a play-oriented, light system like this is less than ideal. I don't mind historically one-sided battles, but I'd like them to still be fun for both sides).

Raised rating to a 9, because it's so quick and simple to teach, but still provides a fun and tense game experience. Might be a nice one to introduce people to wargames with.

PbeM suitability: quite high, with the caveats of the First Strike card and the occasional retreat or evade decision (although these are often trivial and can be assumed based on discussion in advance).

Got the game yesterday. My rating is based on the components. Lovely mounted map, lots of blocks and colourful stickers and rule book and scenario book & charts in colour.

I'll be busy stickering blocks tonight and will hopefully get a scenario in too!
Updated rating to a 10! I've had five solo plays in about as many days and most have been close games. The game not only hinges on the cards you pull but also on what you do with the ordered units. Will I move that cavalry unit or should my slingers take a shot?

Had at least 10 solo plays in the past week or so! Played the Canne scenario 3 times. Rome 1 - Carthage 2!

This game is a vast improvement over Battle Cry (which I really did not like).  The Battle Cry game system seems more suited to ancient warfare than civil war or WWII warfare.  In addition, there are new rules that improve game play but add only a little more complexity.   In my humble opinion, the wooden blocks used in this game make better game pieces than plastic figures like those used in Battle Cry and Memoir 44.  But, overall it just isn't very interesting to me.

This is a nice, light alternative to more traditional wargames.  A lot is determined by the cards that you have available in your hand (sometimes, some units will remain untouched for an entire scenario, which feels a bit/lot weird), but there is still a decent amount of opportunities for tactical thinking.

The production quality is superb and there is a huge number of scenarios in the box and available online to keep you busy for a long while with the base set alone.

Commands & Colors is physically attractive, though the quality of the some of the components is below Eurogame standards (albeit quite good for GMT) - the cardboard map is particularly unimpressive, the stickers tend to fall off the blocks and the dice are ugly. The rulebook is longer than I expected and it is not particularly easy to refer to important rules, but nevertheless the system is simple while managing to capture the essence of ancient battles - the concept of flanks and centre and related cards realistically potrays the overall pattern of battles, while the subtle morale/support rule beautifully simulates the danger of exposed flanks. Scenarios play quickly but offer some scope for tactical decision-making besides the obvious card management asppect. The element of chance is pitched just right, allowing a player who is behind always to have some hope of snatching victory.

In my opinion the best of the Command & Colors system by far.  The additional unit types, the ability to battle back, the ability to evade, and the ability to command a line of troops add several more layers of strategy to this game.  The included player aid is superb and helps immensely in learning each unit's abilities.  However, the added depth may be looked upon as "rules-fiddlyness" by lighter gamers and non-gaming spouses.  My wife did not like the game as well as its lighter sibling Battle Cry.  I know that some miss the minis, but in my opinion the blocks worked out to be functionally superior.  I would have preferred a mounted board and better dice.  The board is useable, but I replaced the dice by putting the stickers on nice heavyweight blanks.

The Combat Results Table is built into the dice! Brilliant! This game is definitely one of my favorites. I'm always in the mood to play. It's quick and easy to set-up. It manages to provide a nice level of detail/simulation without the usual corresponding increase in complexity. The player aid cards greatly facilitate the learning curve, although I've played so many times that I don't really need them anymore. The wooden block units and large hexagons dividing the map board give this game a nice tactile feel. As someone who has spent years pushing small cardboard chits around maps overlaid with hexagons measuring less than an inch across, the C&C game components are a pleasure to use. 
This game is not meant to be an accurate historical simulation, and some complain that luck plays too big a role. Although there is some truth to this, it is possible to develop tactics that make the best use of what Lady Luck decides to offer, and while it might not be the most accurate simulation of history, it's real fun to play.

After several plays, I quickly think this is the best of the C&C titles.  It doesn't have the beautiful pieces of Memoir (I don't mind the blocks at all), but it has definitively more depth... with more unit types, leader influence, and deeper battle rules.  The FUN factor is very high.  The game mechanics keep the feel of 'line' combat with ancient units. The game plays fast, and the tactical decisions are certainly more complicated than in Memoir or Battlecry. Nice job Mr. Borg

Works allot better then lets say memoir 44, because of the use of formations and making them able to move in formation rather then group per group.

Excellent game. Lots of easily acessible flavour without being as "picky" or "gritty" as GBOH.
I like both but this is quicker (and I prefer it to SGBOH which seems somehow less satisfying due to the repeated leader activations)

RATING: 7
This was an enjoyable and quick war game. I played a quick scenario without terrain, so I'm still with holding full judgement. I found the provided "cheat sheets" a little  complicated and hard to read, though this might have been more of an effect of the rules. If the charts had a few more symbols, say a -X or  X for the ability to hit on the swords roll, instead of a numbered foot note that has to be cross referenced, the "cheat sheet" would be much easier to use.

RATING: 7
Tactical ancients game. Nifty components, including a ton of small wooden blocks, extremely sturdy box.

First impression: I wavered between giving the game an initial rating of 7 or 6. The game is obviously meant to be fast and "fun", but even knowing it wouldn't be the next SPQR, the lightness of the whole thing surprised (and slightly disappointed) me.

Now, this is based on only a few games, so perhaps I just have to recognize and accept the niche this game falls into: More beers & pretzels than a serious game of ancients battles.

Being one of the few people in the universe who has not played any of the game's predecessors (Battle Cry and M'44), I am astonished to hear that C&C:A is a markedly more complex game than those earlier games. If those games are considerably lighter than C&C:A, it cements my impression that they aren't for me.

Back to C&C:A : Still, a game which looks great and where you can slog through a battle in 30 minutes (less than an hour, anyway) has something good going for it. :-)

Got this for my brother for Christmas, and now I think I must have it. The dice rolling is still swingy sometimes, but there's lots of interesting decisions. Also, sometimes the special power cards are just unreal strong, and there's nothing you can really do. I don't know how deep the system is, but it's definitely fun.

RATING: 8
Very simple ruleset, and actually feels more skill-driven than other wargames I've played.  There is of course some swinginess in the dice, but it seems very much outweighed by maneuvering.

Played a fairly straightforward scenario, without terrain or any of the more complicated units, and I was surprised by how many interesting decisions were available.  The cards can get a little frustrating if you don't have the right ones to press the attack or get out of a difficult situation, not unlike other systems, but far more mildly than, say, Combat Commander.

I may actually buy this at some point, which I never expected to say of a tactical wargame.

The blocks are beautiful.

Hard to get people interested in this game because of its outward, academic appearance. But once it's on the table and people start playing cards, moving blocks and throwing dice they can hear the thunder of hooves, the clash of arms, and the calls of leaders. It's an amazingly immersive game that tells a story with simple mechanics and only the most economical chrome.

In short, this is my kinda wargame when it comes to playing F2F.

RATING: 7.5
I've liked each stage of the Colors and Commands system and it just gets better with each installment.

At the moment, and it may be because this is the new one, Ancients and Battlelore are my favorites. That said, it's a close race. Memoir '44 and Battle Cry (now Battlelore as well) have plastic bits, but all have a lot of fun in the game.

I like the fact that expansions are coming out as they will only add legs and more play options. One of the reasons I love Memoir is for the expansions (and the bits), one of the reasons I like Ancients over Memoir is for the match in theme vs. game play.

Are any of these games bad? Not for me; I do find the lack of a card incredibly frustrating when I'm practically peeing myself in trying to 'Maverick' it out of the deck, but that's the limiter in the game system...it's a break down in command and communication, it's a faultering of field leaders, it's a good thing and strikes me as a different way of modeling the sporadic action of "chit pull" games that limit and dictate movement opportunities.

Like the rest of the series it lacks in miniature realism by totally ignoring the importance of unit formations (flank/rear/overlap). This game represents Ancient warfare as much as RISK represents WWII. Good for "wargaming" with your wife/girlfriend or kids but not much else.

RATING: 9
If you are looking to recreate famous ancient battles this is the game for you. Six different armies:
2 Roman Armies
1 Carthage Army
1 Barbarian Army
1 Far East Army
1 Greek Army

The base game comes with two of course but with the expansions you can get them all.

A Card Driven War Game. Manuever your troops and attack.
The Scenarios are well put together with plenty of more scenarios to be found on the internet you will never run out of battles to be fought.

Game set up is quick and easy. The battle system is quick and easy to resolve. Game pick up is fast and easy.

14/6/11 Down a nick to 9.5. Why? Because I just don't like it quite as much as my other 10s.

Richard Borg's quick and dirty tactical CDG engine is a much more subtle design than gamers with little or no experience of the system might be led to believe from the chequered history of some of its incarnations. These subtlties are most evident in C&C:A, about which I share the widespread opinion that it's the best version of the C&C engine, the one which most seamlessly merges the system and its theme to make you feel you're doing the business. A modern masterpiece without a shadow of a doubt. PLAY THIS AS OFTEN AS YOU CAN! ;)

RATING: 9
A excellent game. It's a bit complex than your brothers "Battlecry" or "Memoir 44", so it a more complete game. It can be played at solitaire. It's almost perfect... but it haven't miniatures... and artwork it isn't enough good O think.

RATING: 9
I am pleasantly surprised that the game really felt different than Memoir '44. I picked up C&C Ancients because I love Memoir, but I expected them to feel the same with different theme. Ancients plays much differently, bigger in scope and less skirmish-like. This could definitely end up a 9 for me eventually.
Edit: I am liking this more and more as I play it. I love how coordinated moves are critical, as opposed to memoir which often just feels like individual units running around.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A brilliant game of tactical combat. The variety of units available offers players a range of choices and adds thematic realism to the experience. The command card system provides a compelling framework for making decisions and issuing your orders. The amount of information regarding the various units and how they move/interact/battle can be overwhelming initially, but herein lies the beauty of the game. The attention to detail in the design choices related to each type of troop distinguishes this game from other similar titles. The historical information in the scenario booklet is icing on the cake. Admittedly not for the casual gamer, but a richly rewarding experience for those who invest the time to learn.

RATING: 8
If Memoir '44 is the blended whisky of the C&C system, then Ancients is the 25 year old Macallan single malt. The Roman period feels like an infinitely better fit for the system, and owning both I can now definitely say I prefer the blocks to plastic minis. 

The additions to the rules regarding Leaders, Evasion, and Battling Back are welcome, despite how powerful the Battle Back option seems at first (rendering Elephants--which at first seem like unstoppable forces of nature--surprisingly difficult to use effectively). New players will find it a bit burdensome to learn and remember the subtle differences between many of the unit types. 

There are plenty of scenarios that ensure quite a bit of replayability. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Nice light wargame (as noted by others). Far superior to Memoir 44 both in the slight added complexity (which improves depth of play) and components. I like the blocks better than the poor quality minis I got with Memoir (all my artillery has bent barrels and the wheels keep breaking off). Blocks give the game a better "era feel". 

And, a cardboard play surface is NOT flimsy.

Big controversy, blocks vs toys. I like the blocks much better. The pieces in Memoir 44 (and Tide of Iron) look quite good but I think unless you are into playing with toys you need to build a proper battlefield and not just use them on boards.

I like the era this covers as well. I also find the cards seem more varied as well. I played too many Memoir 44 games where I had a hand full of move units on the right when all my units were on the left. It does not seem to happen so much with C&C, and you get Elephants.

Brilliant design, simple rules, loads of scenarios to give massive re-playability.  I've played around 100 games and still love it.  Dice or cards can sometimes conspire and your luck and be unbelievably good or bad, but generally more experience helps.  The amazing thing about this highly abstracted game is that it feels like abcient battles - the role of leaders and the support from being in formation with other units being the key items in my view.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.8
"Each C&C game is played very differently. With Ancients, the overall firepower is weak (but nasty)and the core of battle is the close combat. Typically, everyone lines up nicely - then everything goes to hell - then the survivors line up for another go. In my opinion, it shows ancient tactics well.

Now Napoleonics is a horse of another colour. Here firepower is deadly and just charging in is a quick way to lose. Cavalry 'can' be decisive against weak and isolated units when launched into the attack at the right time. The game plays more as a chess game and it often takes longer due to players discarding poor cards and creating a good 'one-two punch' combination."

I marched on the city of Arkagas with about 20 sessions of Memoir '44 to my credit. As a fan of the system, I wasn't sure whether I was in for a mild disappointment ("more of the same") or a fresh take on the familiar. The game quickly enveloped my skepticism and then waded into it with heavy infantry. I love it because despite the luck of the dice (and to some extend the luck of the draw), it rewards solid tactics. If you break formation in this game, you will likely pay for it. The differences between units gives you lots of strengths to play up and weaknesses to play down. The maneuvering satisfies without resorting to the "factor counting" prevalent in heavier wargames. I imagine I could play each scenario twice from each side without depleting the game's vast reserves of replayability, and that's 64 sessions out of the gate, before adding five expansions. I shouldn't gloss over the aesthetic appeal this game has for me either. The blocks evoke troops on the march and make the board easily scannable. Ancient Warfare just does it for me in a way WWII never will.

I'm ambivalent about it.  It isn't sure whether it wants to pile on the details or if it wants to be a breezy, light game with an Ancients theme.  If it wants to be a game, then why aren't the scenarios much more tightly balanced?  If it wants to be a meaningful depiction of ancient warfare, then why isn't there more emphasis on the differences between armies? (which is easy enough to show - most miniatures systems manage such)  Still, it is fun in a beer and pretzels fashion and trumps the available competition on the market.

I have a longer review up on the Armchair general site.

Update:  I think the Greeks & Eastern Kingdoms expansion is an immense improvement which merits owning the original release.

After 4 plays I made up my mind and prefer CC:A to Battle Cry. Now 7/10.
---
The Commands & Colors games are certainly good games as their ratings on BGG show but I'm undecided whether the system could do it for me. I played this one once and Battle Cry a few times online. I can't yet say which one I prefer. The main plus of these games vs. other wargames is their short playing time and ease of rules. That speaks for Battle Cry. On the other hand there's more game to CC:A. The increased importance of close combat, the possiblity to react and the more varied command cards give way to far more clever moves. Have to try more.

I am not a fan of the Command and Colors games. The card-driven order mechanic and die rolling are too luck-driven for my tastes, and there generally aren't enough unit types to keep me interested. C&C:Ancients relieves one of those problems for me by presenting many different unit types, all with specialized advantages and disadvantages. It is the development of all of the new unit types that makes this game capture the aura of ancient warfare. Of course the order mechanic will still leave in question whether or not you can play to your army's strengths. Because of the unit diversity and my love of the genre, I'll play this over Battle Cry or Memoir every time.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
After half-a-dozen plays, I've come to feel that C&C:A, especially in the Epic form, is the cream of the C&C system games--with the caveat that I haven't played C&C:N or the revised Battle Cry yet. As much as I love Memoir and (for me, anyway) have played the hell out of it (30+ games), I'd now prefer Ancients if time permitted. My only practical gripe is with the rulebook, which should and could easily be a quarter shorter and should be "case numbered" (9.0, 9.1, etc.) as is nearly every other GMT game. Richard Borg "gets away" with a verbose, hard-to-reference rulebook because C&C:A is a great game and fundamentally easy. The book could just be so much better, and I'm toying with a rewrite for my own self if nothing else.

I would also now say that while C&C:A is a 9, Epic Ancients is a 10. It's, to my mind, exactly the way C&C:A should be played, even (especially?) with two players. Expansion #5 has shite card holders, but the Epic-specific deck is mighty handy.

I really like the aesthetics of this game - it's like the illustrations in history books, where they show the cavalry, archers etc. as blocks, with arrows and everything showing where they move to. Feels like you are a general sending your orders, keeping track of the results of skirmishes etc.

Cracking action, acceptable history - good compromise between entry-level playability and period feel.  Without all the terrain and fortification typical in a Memoir'44 scenario, C&C has a much quicker setup/teardown time, and better gameplay to my mind.  Well worth the steepish price.

Easy to learn and fast to play.  I have played any number of scenarios with my sons, who are not traditional wargamers, and that gives it a plus right off the bat.  The player aid card contains almost all of the information needed, so very little rulebook consulting is needed.  The only complaint is that I had to spend extra to get decent dice.

Blocks really add to the overall aspect of the game, that is even better than expected.
C&C Ancients plays fast, has depth, historical feel, and above all, I can play it with my son who loves to play it as much as I do.

It hits the table more often than other (longer) games I may prefer, but that's an indisputable quality in itself!

RATING: 6
A skirmish wargame based on Rome vs Cartage. Some interesting ideas create more depth to the game compared to its sibling Memoir 44, but there are many things which don't work for me. Firstly the wooden blocks are tiny and hard to see upright. On a regular table top, you'd need to bring yourself down to eye-level with the pieces so its very hard to see what everything is at a glance. 

Also, since GMT uses printed stickers for the pieces, a few symbols would've been nice (e.g. maybe movement OR range OR close combat dice). With so many units, its hard to sometimes keep track of what everyone can do. Components quality was definitely poor, from board to the artwork to the dice.

The game itself is pretty similar to M44. There's a bit of tension as everyone races to do what they can given their command cards. The extra rules add a bit more strategic flavor to it, but ultimately its still a pretty random dicefest.

I absolutely love the system. This however is not shared by the players I've engaged with as there are often complaints about the limitations of movement and frustration of the card draw. I can understand these complaints.. however, I love the puzzle aspect wherein I'm granted a limited hand of maneuvers and it's up to me to make best work of a tricky situation. Couple this with the thrill of the dice roll and back and forth swing of combat outcomes means this is actually more of a casual engagement for me. One that I can sit back and watch an episode of events unfold with great intrigue, story and humour! Pity everyone else would rather avoid such an experience.

Wow. Seriously impressed. This is a notable improvement on Memoir '44, Battle Cry, etc. The level of complexity is ramped up nicely -- not too hard, but definitely harder than Memoir. There is a lot more thought required, more tactics required, and more strategy required. Certainly the best of Borg's games.

After reading most of the rules for 90 minutes, my friend and I were ready to try the introductory battle.    We didn't have to read the rules about terrain for this simplified battle.

Most of the rules seemed intuitive.   There are only a few tricky things we had to look up while we played.    Even so, it was fatiguing to read the rules for 90 minutes.

It was fun.   Once we saw how the units move and attack, it was a pretty evenly matched battle.   The momentum on the board swung back and forth once or twice. 

It took 2 hours to play.   We both said we would play it again in the future.   If we do, it will be more fun, not having to read everything first.

I like the game more than a 6 rating would suggest.   I just don't anticipate playing this very often, or with many different people.

RATING: 7
This version of the basic movement and attack system seems to be a much better fit for its simulated time period than what was the case in Battle Cry. The tide of battle can still turn completely on a couple of rolls and victory go to whomever draws the right card in the endgame, but if you just look at the ranks advancing and breaking it feels like a fairly convincing representation of armies moving around the battlefields of antiquity. One possible exception: you can get into some gamey situations where, because of the victory conditions, each player needs to hunt down or snipe a single weakened unit and not much else matters. Scenarios haven't necessarily been designed for fairness, but you should be able to play back-to-back games in 2-3 hours.

Nifty system for turning guys in sandals into hamburger. You really get a sense that with all your feints, your move-fire-moves, and evasions that you're really on some dry field with cracked feet, getting cut to bits. The system is a fascinating portrayal of ancient combat just after the phalanx: every single one of the five or six things I knpw about the Punic wars gets a clever rule, a special counter, or a cameo. As the guy I played with said, elephants are like hand grenades - you might want to watch what you do with those. 

Hint on the 2nd battle of Beneventus: HIDE SCIPIO. Don't bother with the veeps you get from going out the back. Just pull everyone together and make the Carthaginians come to you. Just like Publius Scipio would've done, if he'd been as smrt as I iz.

Had to dock the game a point because if I really wanted to spend half my life staring at beige I would've become a civil servant.

My second-most played game, but I've grown tired of it.  I wish it had a stronger rule on facing for the sake of  historicity.  That moment when my cavalry attacked a chariot from the rear and ended up destroyed by its "battle back" was disheartening.  

Flanking: When an attack is launched from behind an enemy unit (the attacker is in a hex row nearer to his opponent's back row than the unit which is attacked), it receives two advantages.  First, the attacked unit may not battle back.  Second, after rolling, the attacker may convert any of his attack dice to a flag.

Based on 4 plays.  C&C:A is a worthy addition to the series.  I like a lot of the new features - battling back, evasion, support, etc.  But these innovative features come with a fair amount of chrome in terms of units and rules.  In my experience, the game also takes considerably longer than, say, M'44, and the cards also seem to be more disparate in power.  Set-up time remains a drag.  (I haven't played Battlelore and I don't think very highly of Battle Cry.)

This is one of a very few games that I always want to play. It's easy to learn, has tactical depth and the games are done in a decently short time span. Even better, my wife likes it too, so I actually get to play it on a semi-regular basis.

Stickering the blocks was a bit of a pain, but you only need to do it once.

I keep trying to play, but it doesn't grab me; feels too much like chess. I can't figure out why use wooden blocks when counters would be so much easier to manage and bring the cost down. Very well thought out mechanics and rules are solid.

After one game I am fairly confident I am going to find this a better game than Battlelore.

Update after more play.  I usually have bad luck at this game, getting outdiced and not drawing the special cards I need to move more than a few pieces each turn.  It's gotten somewhat tiresome.

Another excellent version of the Command and Colors system.  This, CC:N and BattleLore are all huge improvements over Battle Cry.  Each features good unit differentiation adding historical flavor for the sims and good decision making opportunities for players.  The games are easy to learn and play fast.

CC:A has a good mix of scenarios.  The Punic Wars make for good battles with different advantages to each army.

While I really liked this game, it occupied a lot of shelf space, and never got much action.  I decided to concentrate on Memoir '44 as my favored iteration of this system.

Sold off.  Although I would happily play if an opponent showed up with this game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.6
Fun game. What it definitely is not is "Great Battles of History Light" -- notably the relative strength of missile fire (very high) and the lack of any unit facing breaks the "mood". This kind of spoils the theme for some of us.   

What it does is is quick playing, tension-creating and a quick fix for the ancients starved gamer. I won't give up on (Simple) GBoH anytime soon, but this is another game and I do think it better than, say, Memoir'44. Now, if only light cav weren't so vulnerable to retreat results and unable to chase down light foot... 

UPDATE: The above still holds but I must add that this has become one of my most played and enjoyed games ever! 

The variety of scenarios is great, especially with the first expansion (Greeks & Eastern countries). Also a wealth of home-made and official scenarios are available on the net. Simply a great game, and great value for money. 

To add some criticism as well, the second printing/edition of the game introduces an undocumented change to the "Mounted charge" card (now all heavy mounted units may move three hexes and attack), and an annoying misprint in the terrain effects listing. Also, they doubled the size of the player aid cards, but failed to include a terrain effects listing. Obviously an effect of the game selling out surprisingly fast, but sad to see anyhow. Also, the rules still need errata/clarifications. 

Well, hopefully there will be a third printing/deluxe edition down the road. Still a wonderful game, well worth the price!

Just not unique enough vs. the other Command & Colors series games.  They all have their subtle differences but ultimately if you want a real wargame go play a real wargame.  If you want something light then Memoir or Battlelore are still far more fun to play with all their pretty bits.  No lack of expansions or extra rules for those ones either.  I enjoy the WW2 and  Fantasy themes more than the ancient one as well but again if I wanted to play a wargame with the ancient theme there are better ones than this (quite a few in fact).  Sorting blocks is no fun either.

One of those games where simple rules create big gameplay complexity. At first it might seem that this is a random game - cards are needed to order units and dice are used to resolve combat. After playing tens of games I see that these randomness can be overcome with skill and in fact it is skill that leads to victory. To be fair I must add that in some games I had a situation when both me and my opponent needed one banner to win and it was all about one lucky dice throw in this last combat.

Another great thing about CC:A is that a single battle takes about 30-60 minutes (games with beginners might be a bit longer).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Very good addition to the C&C system.  The blocks make a great substitute for plastic figures and I think I even prefer blocks to figures.  The modifications to the basic system to account for Ancients combat (Leaders, Missile fire, Evade, Battle Back, etc) really give the system a different "feel" from Memoir '44 or Battle Cry.  Recommended.

Command & Colors Ancients is a really good "wooden blocks" style wargame. The maps are typically unbalanced, but do a good job of re-creating the sense of chaos that would have existed on the ancient battlefield. Obviously there is a lot of luck to the game, and this sometimes makes it impossible for you to push an advantage to its logical conclusion. But this is true for your opponent, as well, leading to bluffing matches based on the positioning of your leaders and strongest units. One other thing I love about C&CA is the fact that you can get the full wargame experience in about an hour and then quickly set it back up and play again!

This is a game I hesitated to buy. It caught my interest as being an for me interesting  combination of history and strategy. I'm a cautious buyer though and some negative comments about it being too random and dull put me off for a while. However planning to buy another board game at a local shop, which turned out to be out of stock, I decided to take the risk. I'm very happy I did! After several battles I'm now able to comment on some of the supposed cons of the game. 

Is the game random? Not particularly more than war in real life is. I think some war-gamers are living in a fantasy world about war being a calculated exercise of intellectuals. Unfortunately it's more often a bloody mess with a longer lists of "unknown unknowns" than knowns (I expect war-gamers to understand the reference). Your strategy will never the less make you more or less vulnerable when mayhem begins. A war-gamer that takes a war-game serious enough to expect it to be determined by strategy within rigid boarders of plausibilities should instead choose abstract strategy games like Go.

Sure this game can be frustrating when not getting the necessary cards and rolls seem to turn against you. So yes, at this stage I'm not giving C & C Ancient a perfect 10, since at rare times the combinations of cards and rolls gets a bit too quirky. Still I've not seen it affect a whole battle and when it has happened it's temporary and eventually balances out. 

What I really like:
- the impact of analysing units and their position before a game starts
- the clever and balanced mechanics of movements and characteristics of units
- while simulating quite complex affects of battle rules are easy to follow and logical
- the experience is more important than who's winning

All in all I want more C & C and have decided to order the combo expansion consisting of original expansion 2 and 3.

As a regular ancients player I have to say that this game gives the best balance of playability, historical flavour and fun I have come across.

This is a light wargame there is no question about that. The added complexity when compared to M44, leaders, battle back, evade etc. makes a big difference for me. The blocks are fine and I do not really miss the miniatures. There is a lot of luck but I do not mind that at all. The C&C system seems to fit the ancient setting better and I am looking forward to further expansions. Well that is my feeling now when the game is hot which also is reflected in my current rating.

This is a great game and a surprisingly good simulation.  Although it's a bit more complex than Battle Cry, it's still amazing how much realism is packed into the rules.  Very subtle, elegant rules give a real feel for the uses of different types of troops, their advantages and disadvantages in different situations.  Problems:  the scenarios are not ballanced (of course not- they simulate the historic situation) but some indication of which side is favored, and by about how much, would have been nice.  Oh, and the dice...

"Del cerdo me gustan hasta los andares".

Really great game. Very possibly my favorite 2 player game... And certainly my favorite QUICK 2 player game. The fact that you can set up and play both sides of a scenario in the time many games take for one game is a great bonus.

Lots of luck but you still feel like you are in control and you can make a difference.

Too... many... stickers...

Complicates the basic simplicity of the Memoir '44/Battle Cry system a little too much - result is a little too complicated for a light game and a little too breezy for a medium-weight game. Good for a short war game.

Played our first game using the first scenario. I got my butt handed to me by Neil. We missed a bunch of rules, so I'll need to reread them and see where we went wrong. The lack of good cards at one point really hurt; there should be a discard mechanism of some kind in my opinion.

Tons of fun crammed into only one hour of play.  This is a game that you can consistently get to the table and actually PLAY.  Once you have the rules down, they are easy to teach to someone else.  The game is tense and exiting, and while it has a lot of luck in the cards and dice, it doesn't overshadow the strategy required and merely adds unpredictability to events.
Very addictive and very well made game.

RATING: 5
I'd love what this game claims to be, but in reality it doesn't give you the feeling of commanding an ancient army. The victory condition requires terminating x units rather than winning the actual battle, so to win you're often better off abandoning your positions and chasing a dying enemy unit that is out of the battle. The command cards randomise what you can do (I can only command light units or mounted units or 3 units on the left - how realistic is that?). Units don't get any weaker when they're 3/4 terminated. The dice cause a huge luck factor, especially near the end of the battle when they can determine whether the loser gets 2 more victory banners or not in one die roll; which usually endd up determining the winner of the game if you take turns playing each side. The C&C system is just deeply flawed imo.

My first game utilizing Richard Borg's Command and Colors system. 

The battles of of Carthage and Rome are things that will delight any ancient history buff, though my true interest in ancient warfare lies with the battles of the Greeks and Persians.

The game is definitely fun and for a CDG i don't ever feel like i'm left making completely subpar moves based on the cards in my hand (Battlemasters anyone?). If anything my opponent is faced with the exact same dillema. The variety of units really does make the game more tactical. 

Great fun and a quick playing time. Very easy to teach as well.

Richard Borg on hex games with blocks underlined by Eurogame system in a GMT presentation.  Richard Borg is always talented at doing a good game system.  I am sold with the well-received comments on this game.  But hey, first I have to stick those stickers on the blocks.  Why they don't do it for us? After playing 3 scenarios in a day, I should say it is a fun and exciting wargame, with a good degree of simulation, even if metaphysical only, of the ancient tactical combat system.  It is right more simpler to GBoH with fewer rules to some of the same effects.  At the same time, it is meatier than Memoir'44 and other Borg's designs. It is really a game of fun for people of different age.  To add value, I hope the game designer can put in the historical results in each scenarios in future.  I have the Greeks and all other expansion games.  There are an accumulated of over a hundred scenarios so far.  Surely one day I will play all of them.

Great "feel" wargame, with more emphasis on reproducing the feel of a battle than on simulating minute historical details--which I like very much.The playing time--under 1 hour--makes this game very playable.

The rules are heavier than those of your typical Euro game, with many special cases intended to better represent reality (e.g., the rules for Elephant Retreat/Rampage).  However, one or two games should allow one to grasp them quite well.

Apparently more strategic than its cousin Battlelore (thanks to the role of Leaders, for instance), and a tad more complex than Memoir'44--which I appreciate, as this makes for a deeper game.

C&C: Ancients has all the satisfaction of Memoir '44 with the additional complications of ancient war technology. Because a player's strength largely depends upon her positioning, the game feels like chess.

After more than a dozen plays, I think this is very fun light wargame, even preferrable to it's brother, Memoir '44, due to it's added depth (leaders, battle-back, etc.). I prefer the blocks to minis, but wish the illustrations could have been better distinguished between the unit types. Overall, the quality is excellent, except the dice are truly crappy and not up to the quality of the rest of the game. Wonderfully fun, fast gameplay.

I'm not the hugest fan of this game and believe it or not its not because i get whipped every time i play. There are a few reasons, firstly: there are no rules for making your own battles, i know people have created their own scenarios there is no way offered to make battles independant of history. secondly: there are no artilary rules, although that might change in further suppliments. Thirdly: The tactics are hugly simplified, there is no flanking advantage and its way to easy to rout units. comapred to DBA i don't think this game is anywhere near as good, i do like the card system though, and the board, it makes terrrain and movement easier. My final reason is simple: this game gave me the clap. The box is massively sturdy though.

Super abstract take on ancient battles, high variety of units. It's rules light, so it can be taught easily. The flagship C&C product. There are also 20 additional scenarios that can be played with just the base game, effectively doubling (and then some) the playable life of the base.

Finally played it after owning it for over a year.  Just the first scenario.  Man, this game is fun and fast.  We learned just how weak the ranged units were, and how strong fighting up-close and personal was.  I had tried BattleLore before, and I found the basic units more interesting to play in C&C:A.  Also, the additional units add more depth to C&C:A for me, while a lot of the more advanced rules in BattleLore seem like painted-on chrome in comparison.  Can't wait to play this again.

Previously owned a second edition. Had to sell it unplayed.
June 2017 picked up a used 4th edition.
+ Exp. 2/3,4,6 from Meeplemart 
+ blocks for Exp.1, spare base deck, Epic deck from Exp 5, extra mounted board from GMT
First couple of games left me cold. New players really need to be aware of the potential effects of the dice, lack of unit support, and the lethality of blocked retreats. My next couple games went much better knowing what to expect. This game is subtle. Once this is understood, the game has lots to offer.
With respect to people believing that everything is too random, I think they are misinterpreting the nature of what the cards and dice represent, as well as possibly having some difficulty sensing the odds. The following articles helped with my understanding and totally changed my outlook on the game play:

WAR!

March in lines and battle!

I was worried about the luck factor in the dice and command cards, but I am no longer.  Choosing the command cards to play, how you will move your troops, and the many options to weigh make this a very interesting game.  

The complexity is not too high, but it is enough that you feel like you are commanding an army and can form a plan to execute (and to adjust when conditions change).  Its a great balance to play a war game that lasts 60 - 90 mins and the game seems just plain fun...each turn feels like a tense decision.  The battle-back, retreat, and leaders are cool parts of the game.  There are many scenarios to play in the box, and with all of the various types of troops this game is as much or more war game then I could ever want.  Even playing the same scenario several times, it feels different every game.

Note: The three hours of assembly before playing the game is a big thumbs down.  I didn't mind too much, but there should be a warning on the box for those who buy a game with plans to learn and play it that evening.

Coming from Memoir 44, this game is a little bit more complicated since there are many different units and each one has his own features. Also few more rules have been added, like evading the battle and so on. However, 2 very helpfull playert chart (one for each player!!!) are included for easy reference. Scenarios are fast like in Memoir 44, only the setting up takes more time. Many scenarios are totally new for me (Akragas, Himera...). The map is not mounted (sigh...) but the quality of the componenets is very very hig. Between the different units, I like a lots the elephants... they really make a lot of mess when they attack... I love them, just give me more of them!!!

Poor production value ruins an otherwise solid game.  Map is creased so badly that it is impossible to flatten.  Blocks are entirely pointless.  Then I found out it was basically a dispute between GMT who wanted to make this game with counters and Richard Borg who wanted to make this game with miniatures.  They comprimised with the worst possible solution.  Let's use the leftover inventory of blocks from our other games so that this game is overpriced and assembly is required...

RATING: 7
Definitely a welcome evolution of the Battle Cry system - the battles now actually look more like battles and there's  greater variation between the strengths and weaknesses of the various unit types.On the down side, there are only 10 scenarios and many of them are one-sided.  Although the game is short enough to make a re-match with swapped sides feasible, I feel that long-term replayabililty will suffer.   My desire to play a battle whose outcome is pretty much pre-determined is limited.

Anyone who disliked the role of luck in Battle Cry and Memoir 44 will probably not like C&C:A either but I imagine that it would not be hard to graft a slightly less chaotic command system onto the already rather good tactical resloution systems.

So, not bad and definitely better as a quick, one-hour wargame filler than Battle Cry but I'm not convinced that in its basic form it will be a lasting pleasure.

Perhaps the proposed expansions (starting with the Macedonians) will provide greater long-term staying power (plus better dice!) although I quail at the thought of applying stickers to another 300 blocks!

This is a tremendous game and was our top choice for two players until, well, BattleLore arrived. Its strength is a bit undermined by the less-than-stellar components, but that's only to be expected for a non-mainstream title.

Updated 9: I think it's hit it's settled rating. It's not my most favorite game, but I still think it's great. A fantastic short bit of tactical fun. 

Updated: 10. OK. After more lengthy play, it goes up. The game has really grown on me. So much so that the time it took to sticker the blocks from the expansions seemed like no time at all!

Updated: 9. Rating had to go up! Played five games in a row and it was really great. Playing through the scenarios a bunch at a time helps round out my impressions and view of the game. I have the first two expansions on order and am excited to keep going in the system!

Updated: 7  There are other tactical games that I enjoy more right now. 

8: Much better than Memoir '44 in my book. This is a great game for a relatively short but tactically tough battle. Such mechanics as "battle back" and "evade" as well as the many unit types make for a very interesting and satisfying game.

After having contacted the C&C system through Memoir 44, this was the other title that interested me. Never found much interest in Battlelore, but this one is great. The Historical setting is well portrayed and so different from Memoir that this shows the versatility of the C&C system.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is the best that the C&C system has to offer. Better than M44 by a little bit and leaps and bounds over the ever disappointing battlelore. 
This is a very simple card driven game of maneuver and support. It works well for what it is, but in the end it is still a very simple game that can come down to luck of the cards or dice.

This game is (not suprisingly) similar to Memoir'44, but I like most of the differences:
+ Leaders add a nice touch and a little complexity
+ Lines of troups become important
+ The setting is ancient
+ more close combat
+ more distinct playing pieces
- less plastic
- I had dificulty making the distinction between all those  different light troups of both sides..

Too luck to me with little space for strategy or tactic. Go for Bonaparte at Marengo (2 players) or Fredrich (multiplayer) instead.
DETAIL:
-You can't have a strategy before to see the Command cards you will receive.
-After you see the C. cards, you can think that you have a strategy, but only for 2-3 turns until you realize the new cards has nothing to do with that strategy (sections, type of troops, movement of the leaders, etc), and you need to change it. It's a chaos. At the end it is not important what kind or troops you have or where...you need to think only in those troops you can use because the CC...so, in fact you need to react  only, turn by turn and cross the fingers for good cards and good dice.
So, go for Memoir 44 instead, because in that game you don't need to memorize the features of each different troop (in any case useless in CC)

This is what all the Commands and Colors games should be.  Rather than three or four different unit types, there are twelve, and they are differentiated in such a way that they seem to follow their historical roles.  That is, light infantry is adequate to harrass (and then run away), but heavy infantry is a killer when you finally get them in contact with the enemy.  Leaders are crucial, as well as keeping your lines in good order, as several of the cards depend on those factors to be used to their full potential.  I can't wait to play again.

Updated after three more plays; raised half a point to 9.  I love this game; it's fun and quick but also relatively meaty in decision-making and historical detail.

Like it better than Memoir'44. This one is much more about movement, holding the line, battling back and leadership where Memoir is more about skirmishing, long range fire and taking cover. That makes Memoir a bit faster and a bit more prone to luck. But that also makes them different games for different moods.

The best of the Borg series. Translates better to older historical eras than modern ones. Some scenarios are unbalanced towards one side; we just switch sides and then add up the total flags. A good mix of historic flavor with playability; I'm not gonna invest the time or effort to play GBoH.

Just started playing solo. I love the ancient battle theme.  From my memoir '44 background, it's hard for me to get used to not worry so much about cover.

Добротный варгейм. Карты приказа хорошо довольно сбалансированы. Хорошо продумана тактическая составляющая игры, но довольно много нюансов. Не слишком зрелищная. Требуется много бросать кубики и довольно редко убиваются юниты. Выигрывает как правило, опытный игрок. Новичек с большой долей вероятности проиграет. Суховато и трудно для просчетов. Может быть значительный даунтайм. Азарт в игре сильно расплывается из-за количества просчетов вариантов передвижений и атак.

A fine, solid and entertaining game where Borg's unique approach to modelling the fog of war really comes into it's own. It makes a good simulation of ancients combat off the back of mediumweight, somewhat fiddly rules, but I find that the cards and dice make for a lighter game than the length of rules can really justify.

5-10 playings in, and I'm happy I got the game. It's simple enough to be entertaining and fun, but complex enough that you actually have to think about what you're doing in order to win. I'm not as in love with the game as most people are, but it fits a genre (multi-scenario, light wargame, playable in an hour) that has few peers. That makes it the perfect filler game when one of our other games ends early and we want to get a little more gaming in for the afternoon.

RATING: 10
Every once in a while, a designer comes along with a game he designed that is, quite simply, brilliant. C&C: Ancients designer Richard Borg has done the near impossible; akin to a major league pitcher throwing a perfect game, Borg has designed the near ‘perfect’ wargame. 

The game provides infinite replay, given a vast card system and the variety of units with unique capabilities. More importantly, the game FEELS like ancient combat, with the field of battle swaying back and forth, flanks being turned and then, just as quickly, reforming. Ranged combat and tough close combat, attackers pursuing and defenders battling back, and of course, rampaging elephants. As in real war, some units hold tough, while others, inexplicably, simply melt away and retreat. With card play, one’s ‘perfect’ battle plan simply goes to the wayside within the first few turns. Nearly every game features tense play, with a deep level of strategy given such a straightforward, clean game system.

The game’s block system is superb, giving the impression of infantry, cavalry, and other units scattered over the plains, jostling and pushing their way forward. The game achieves a primary goal of good game design: bring the players to a level of ‘disbelief,’ where one is no longer pushing wooden blocks, but leading units of men into battle.

The rulebook is professionally done, the reference charts pack a lot of needed information, and playing pieces are first rate. The game flows well, is fun, and each battle can be completed within 2 hours. What more could one ask for?

RATING: 6
Not really a simulation, it just doesn't feel "real" to me (no unit facing, strange retreat rules, unit differentiation is too abstract).  That said, it does not have the simple and fun feel of Memoir '44 either, which can be taught in 5 minutes.  I wanted to like it but will probably sell my copy and go back to Simple GBoH.

RATING: 10
1/1/13: Upgraded to a 9.5 after 3 plays.

17/11/12:  Rates this game a 9 after just 2 plays, may go higher.  Love it.  Glad I bought it (which I did without play testing first), appeals to my love of ancient history.  

Great battles, lots of surprises, fantastic card driven fog of war.  Plays quickly.  Pieces are great (although do take quite a while to sticker up).  Most of the rules are simple enough for regular games once learned.  Not sure if this would be great for non-gamers though (haven't tested introducing to non gamers as yet).

Exciting and tense.  Look forward to playing one side completely (Carthage initially), then swapping for the other.

Suprisingly for me it is a good game, because this one I can play with my girlfriend. Also it seems to be a good introductory game. Playing time is 30 minutes to an hour, so You can play it several times a day. There are quite a lot of scenarios (10 official + 3 in the C3I) and enough possibilities for design your own. The little drawback is, that the rules for war machines were not included. Also I can't imagine a battle with roman elephants.
Seems, that more stuff will be produced and I like this game much more than the Euro-Style games like Republic of Rome.

I very much enjoy the game, but since it treads the same ground as GBOH, it is inevitable that I compare the two as I play.  GBOH is a far, far better system.  Ok, the GBOH battles take a lot longer, but you just have so many more decisions. I can see why games like C&C: Ancients, Battle Cry, and Memoir '44 have fans and I am going to enjoy playing C&C: Ancients with light wargamers, but there is just no way that the wealth of GBOH will be eclipsed anytime soon.

Update: I raised this 0.25 just because everyone I play with enjoys the game.  One thing that C&C:A outclasses GBOH in is the number of opponents!!!

I want to like this game more than I do. I love the concept, but I feel like the lack of other objectives hurts the game along with the luck factor. More of a hand management game than a tactics game, so maybe that is my hangup.

RATING: 7
07/02/16 Played the Ticinus River scenario twice (each side once). Both games took about an hour each.  

Having played four other titles in the C&C series, it was pretty good. If I ranked them I called Memoir '44 my favorite, Battle Cry as a very close second, then C&C: Ancients, then lower, due to its complexity, C&C: Napoleonics, and finally Battle Lore, as I don't care for fantasy.  
- What I liked about the game was: The C&C series in general . The complexity of this one was a little more than I prefer, but not overwhelming.  From what little I saw of the rules and scenario booklets they appeared fine. 
- What I was not a fan of was: Using blocks when they aren't for fog of war purposes (I own Hammer of the Scots and Richard III and love them). I think this game would have been better if they'd used exchange counters (ala Hold the Line) to signify reduced units. I assume the cost of counters would be less than blocks. Plus the owner wouldn't have had to spend a great amount of time putting stickers on both sides of 345 blocks. (To say nothing of this game's many expansion sets!)
- What I thought was barely adequate:  the cards (rather bland), and the unmounted map. The dice were fine, but I think 8 should have been furnished (ala M'44 and Battle Cry) instead of the seven provided. The sticker art was so-so.   

I'd be happy to play the game again, but I'd never buy it.

A nice game to play, but really not all that special, way overrated in my opinion. It is a simple game in fact with a considerable luck factor in card drawing and dice rolling. I am not a wargamer, but in any case I am not impressed with this game. Also very unbalanced sides in the basic scenario.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Given I usually only have 1-2 hours to play, this game is the most fun I can currently have. Great ancients 'feel' without all the complexity. Command card system sounds artificial, but I feel it gives a very good 'historical' result. I really feel like I'm the commander, cursing my left flank (say), when it won't do what I want (because I don't have the command cards). The blocks work much better than miniatures would - they feel like my troops are lined up in formation. Miniatures would feel too sparsely populated (a problem I have with battlelore, but not memoir 44 strangely).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Good game with a bit of randomness.  But I can vouch that it's not the more skillfull that wins each time.  I should have lost but I still won because of a great hand I picked.  Nonetheless a good game I enjoyed.  I suspect that the company I was with has more to do with the enjoyment than the game itself.

Rating change accordingly after playing Batlles of Westeros, which contain less luck and more skills.

So far, so good.  Played 1st scenario solo, and I squashed my opponent at scenario 11.  Quite a lot of fun.

RATING: 7.7
An enjoyable and playable game with a surprisingly good level of "flavour" for ancient warfare.  Seemingly simple with some clever interactions between troop types.  I dont think its a good model for historical battles but it is a fun game and a good intro for people who don't normally play wargames.

I now have the complete set of expansion games as well - I just couldn't help myself!!

It is a little slower playing than Memoir '44, but I love the emphasis on formations. You also get a lot of content for you money. 15 scenarios in just the base game and the expansions have 20 or 25 in each of them. I'll be playing this for a long time.

Really, played only two times, the first two scenarios. First, as an eurogamer mostly (ex-owner of Memoir '44 - traded because of the absurd amount of luck involved), I just can't understand the cost of it. I know is standard for a wargame, but come on, this thing is more expensive than Twilight Imperium!!!! WHY? The dice are the WORST components that I saw in a game in a long time. About the game itself. A luckfest, with some strategy (more than on M44). Most units are useless, at least in the first 2 scenarios. You kill with the heavies or mediums... run away with the lights. Not many options strategically speaking. I mean, you'll only have options if you get the right command cards. Otherwise, follow the only strategy possible. Some cards can just kill your strategy, like first strike. I was playing a game with a friend, lost miserably, and he said that it was because of my "flawed" strategy. The dialogue: "Why didn't you attack me there? It was the obvious strategy!" "Sorry, I couldn't attack you, I had the troops, you were weakened and all that, because I had NO CARDS TO DO SO!!!" That's terrible for me. And when he attacks you with 5 dice and gets 4 hits... Ok, any chance you have to win is over in the first strike... That's ridiculous.... I can stand some luck in the games, I love War of the Ring, for example. But hey, that's too much. 


Now shoot me.

Good production values and the game looks neat all set up.  Best of the C&C games that I've played.  Still, I'd prefer to play a more detailed hex & counter ancients/medieval game (eg. a "Men of Iron" series game) over C&C: Ancients.

I would rate it a bit higher if there was more difference between units.. come on where's the Legion?  The sides seem too generic.  But thats a small quibble.  Sturdy box with nice wood block components, colorful chart, rulebook and units.  I am sucker for expansions and will get them all....  Again, a great game for beginners and those who have time constraints.

Really good.  About as much fun as you can have with a light war game.  The wood blocks are much easier to move around than the minis and I find that to be a plus.  Also this era is by far the most appealing to me out of all the C&C games.  This system just feels really well suited for ancient battles and I prefer wood blocks to minis any day.  Great selection of units and various abilities, not to mention I like the card actions better than the other sets C&C sets.  A+.

Richard Borg has gotten this right - probably overshadowed by the release of Battlelore, this is the true heir to the Battlecry 30-45 minute card driven/dice throwing fighting romp.  Despite relative simplicity, there is a LOT going on here with regard to battlefield choices - hold the line, or let your heavy infantry wade into the other guys's forces and start wrecking?  Expose your calvalry by going after the light troops?  Once you learn the composition of the deck, there is the additional factor of hand management - again,a lot more going on here than luck of the dice - which, btw, does count.  Which, makes it just like any other football game - any given battle. . . . and if it goes bad, you haven't blown your afternoon. . . .

While I rate the base game of C&C Ancients just a half point below C&C Napoleonics, the expansions for ancients definitely bring it back up to a full 10. The slightly simpler gameplay of Ancients makes it extremely attractive for introducing new players to the C&C system.

It's a must have. The game is very dense for such a short length (a real hour, not more). There are many types of armies and therefore operational and strategic consideration must be accounted for. I usually prefer strategic wargames dealing with the whole war instead of simple battles, but this one is short enought and powerfull enough to get me involved. Memoir44 is a bit different, not worse, i guess.
Congratulations Mr. Borg! Keep them coming!

It is a next step in the BattleCry >> M44 >> ... progression. If you prefer history to fantasy I would pick this over BattleLore.

The only warning I give aside from being aware of increased detail is that the pieces are a bit 'fiddly'.

RATING: 6
Either myself or gamers in my group have played every scenario in this game plus the first 4 expansion packs. We play this game alongside monster games with an alternating turn structure so that it gives these gamers something to do while they wait for their turn. 
As such it makes for a simple, easy to play game, with a balance of strategy and luck.

Some of the gamers in my group play this using a larger cloth map along with period miniatures for added flavour. This approach works well at games conventions.

I suspect that the '6' rating reflects a certain degree of jadedness with the system, however at last count 88 scenarios had been played - so it can't be all bad!

Several plays now, and the game is still pretty good.  Which is too bad, because I have the most rotten luck with it that I'd like to throw it into a ravine.  Halfway through each game, I'm ready to pull out my hair, but by the end I'm ready to play again.  It's like having a fantastic appetizer, an okay meal, and then a ridiculously good dessert, which leads you to rate the whole thing as YUM.

The theme isn't a plus or negative.  The art isn't that great, but does draw me in enough to feel the ancient battle happening.

The gameplay is interesting.  I don't know if I like the card system, but it does force you to make some interesting decisions.

I sold it thinking Battlelore would be better, but Battlelore just added more randomness, and an annoying business model (though I do prefer fantasy as a theme, and minis).

This game was a lot more fun before I solved it. It's basically one big linear equation. 

I played this with my brother in Sacramento. It reminds me a lot of our kid's game "Battle Master" without the cannon that could bounce around and crush your own soldiers. The idea of picking special cards from a hand is great. The rules weren't as overwhelming as I thought and the games we played ran smoothly. It looks bland, but it's fun. We laughed a lot.

It's been said before, but the mechanics that started with Battle Cry finally find a home with C&C:A. When you see one side's army fragmenting into little bits, and the other's formed into neat lines and columns, you can tell who's winning.

On the downside, the battle back rules tend to occasionally kill the experience for me. Several wonky situations have come up because of them, including a 3-unit cavalry charge against an exposed flank of medium infantry... the cavalry (including 1 heavy) all get wiped out by this one lone unit.

I think we're going to houserule that any given unit can only battle back once during each opponent's turn to mitigate these situations.

Edit: sadly, BattleLore has replaced any desire I have to play C&C:A again. That doesn't make C&C:A a worse game, it just means BattleLore is a better one in my opinion.

It's still a simple wargame but has enough amount of details to make it historically interesting. There is also a great amount of skill despite the luck factor. Almost 100 official scenarios are currently available and GMT supports the game through its C3i magazine with new articles and additional scenarios.

Good game of medium difficulty. Nice components that offer a pleasant Ancient flavor. Some might think the stickering a drawback but I like it. For me, a wargame for beginners.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The C&C system is much better suited to ancient combat since the card-driven system is based on activating units in the center (of the map) or the wings.  CC:A is more meaty than Memoir '44; it adds rules for leaders, battle-back, morale (support) and has a good variety of combat units.  The game comes with a player aid card that does a great job summarizing each unit's special capabilities.

Not really my style, but the game itself is very good. Just a little much to keep track of with all the unit types. This is definitely the big boy's version of the Commands & Colors system, as half the game is all about maneuvering your troops into various positions.

I liked BattleLore, because it made it fun to have theme-rich 'historical' battles... I love Commands & Colors: Ancients because it is simply a game, and feels like I am actually commanding troops in the midst of battle.

After some plays i have to say: This is worse than a bad game, this is a good game that seems to yield historical correct results (as someone has said), but with historical dubious procedures.

After reading the prepublication Rules of Battles of Westeros: Bye, Bye CCA. Battles of Westeros seems to catch the deficiencies of CCA: Flanking, Engagement and Army specific card decks. I don't know if it is still too hollow for me but it is a shame that FFG has to teach GMT how to get most of a simulation out of a simple system.

Much more complicated than Memoir 44 (I've played almost three dozen scenarios now and am just now getting comfortable with teaching others) but this does have its own charm.

Terrific wargame, best I've bought in years.  In fact it's so good I bought a second copy to keep as a 'reserve' in case my original wears out and it goes out of print, something I have never done before in 25 years of wargaming.  Simple elegant mechanics that give a great 'feel' for the period.  That should be the goal of every wargame.  The short setup and playtimes are very welcome.  I've come to actually prefer the blocks to plastic Memoir '44 style figures.  I give this game my highest recommendation.

I actually got my copy of this game from Richard Borg, himself.  Was at Gencon 2006 and no one had it.  A friend and I were walking around the miniature hall when we saw "Richard Borg" on a name tag.  He's a fantastically nice guy, and we ended up talking with him for a good hour.  When I told him about being unable to find a copy of C&C he went out to his car and pulled two copies out of the trunk.

For me this game has the perfect balance between rule exceptions (for specific units) and rule generality, cautious advance and "daring" attacks, and overall game time.  It's very satisfying watching mounted troops slam into a flank and do serious damage.  It is also satisfying seeing supported foot soldiers produce the chaotic retreat of such an assault.  Then again, I've always enjoyed the history of the period in which this game is set.  Finally, this game plays really well solitaire or as a two-player.  It's everything that a miniatures-type game should be as far as I'm concerned.

Using the same game system as Memoir '44 and Battlecry, this game depicts the war of Rome versus Carthage. There is a bit more complexity introduced, with light, medium and heavy units, some units can evade, and special powers for leaders. It is essentially the same game as it's predecesors.

Great game, rewarding strategic planning as much as tactical opportunism.  Lots of details to keep on top of, but it carries well as a challenging and rewarding game.  There's enough sense of simulation carried through the theme, but it's with a broad brush - and that's just fine.
Abstraction of the [i]fog of war[/i] through card draw and dice rolls may feel limiting, although it helps to recognise it as the limitation of command.  If it feels like the cards and dice are working against you, maybe you're depending too much on luck.

I finally got a chance to play the new Borg game today.  We played 3 games. I know very little about ancients but here's how our games went. The first scenario we played was Akragas 406BC took about 90 minutes with us referring to the rules many times.  The Syacusan's changed history and beat the Carthaginians'.  Next we played one of the bonus scenarios, Metaurus 207BC twice.  Both times the Romans wiped out the Carthagians in about 30 minutes matching the historical result which was the beginning of the end for Hannibal.  Overall a fun experience, slightly meatier the M'44 with leader bonuses and evade and defensive fire rules.  The blocks are fun and great stickers but sometimes a little small for old mens' eyes.  There is a big deck of command and specialty cards, some of which can be quite devasting.  The bottom line is keep a good line formation and keep your leaders handy yet safe for best results.

RATING: 8
Fun and simple.

The battles are historic, and as such some of them tend to be heavily favored towards one side or the other. This may be a problem for some but personally I had no big issue with it. The only reason it isn't any higher is because the Commands & Colors battle system just isn't something I'm huge on. I like it to some extent, but if I'm going to play  a war game I want something a little bit more immersive.

Still, I wouldn't turn this game down in most situations.

This one certainly deserves the praise.  The claims of being best of the series (BattleCry and Memoir 44 being the others) are very true.  The system is much more appropriate for the ancients setting, and the added rules add A LOT to the tactical control.  Battle back, being able to declare evasions and setting up favorable formations go a far way to help moderate the luck that the cards and dice provide.  High recommendation.

Memoir 44 is a 9 to me.  This game is a 10 and will probably be the only 10 I'll ever give.  It uses my favourite theme (Ancients) and builds upon the rules of Memoir to give us slightly more complexity.  Blocks are great, better than I imagined.

More complex than Memoir 44 or Battle Cry but definitely has the same feel.  With two levels of light troops (archers and slingers are virtually the same), four levels of cavalry (light and light bow are close), and four levels of infantry, blocks seems like a better idea than they may have seemed originally.  The need to maintain your lines to get the "May Ignore" bonuses on retreat and to use many of the command cards effectively makes it a superior game to the others.

The set up is a major pain for such a simple game, otherwise it's reasonably fun. I'm surprised by the fact that flanking attacks, or attacks from the rear have no real effect on combat, making position irrelevant (except that if you're attacking from behind you cannot retreat, but this hurts the attacker as much as the defender). Since there is no positional advantage, there is little tactics (once you've understood that you should form a line to get support). The only decision making comes from choosing the card you want to play, but that's pretty limited, so the best advice I can give is to get good dice.

I consider it a good introduction to wargaming for children (meaning boys) aged between 4 and 6 who cannot read. Then I'd move to simple card-driven games.

I've really come to enjoy Battle Cry and wanted to give yet another game a try from this game system. Overall, I was somewhat disappointed. I can see how others would like this game more, since it is much more of a war game than Battle Cry, but I liked it less for two reasons. The first being the different types of units on the same size blocks. This was confusing for me and I prefer the plastic minis. Second, some of the rules were a bit more indepth and just didn't give me the light feel that Battle Cry gives me. I'm thinking with more consistent plays, this reason will be a good instead of a bad, but since this is my initial thought, there you go.

IMHO The best of the C&C/Memoir/Battlelore card driven system. The period seems to work best with that system and "feels" right. The "Heavies" are quite scary to approach, especially when formed up into decent lines. The "Lights", dance and scrimish, and a Cavalry charge at the right time can make or ruin your day. No free shots in this game. Love it, a great game that I'd (so far) play anytime I've a chance.

Neat. The system works very well, and it's a "wargame" I can actually convince other people to play. Gets a minor ding for the cards, which I think sometimes are a little overpowerful, and bad runs of luck with them are near-impossible to overcome. Maybe it's just a question of 'getting better at it'.

Only played a handfull of games so far (2013-2014). Great game, could do with some aids like a summary Turn order sheet and a unit card (a la memoir) instead of the booklet with overview of all units (bit more cumbersome finding the 4 or 5 unit types you use each time in the total list).
Plan to play this strategic game a lot more.

RATING: 6
The battle system from Memoir '44 applied to the ancient world. The cards are nearly identical but the line command cards are a nice - and thematic - addition. Gameplay is more complex and there are significantly more unit types. 

Component quality and artwork are virtually non-existent: The board is of the same thickness as in Afrikan tähti, and the dice are unbelievably crappy. Artwork on the terrain tiles is really bad, and the command cards are not as easy to recognize as in Memoir. The units are too tiny: I can't even see the pictures on the blocks, let alone distinguish them from one another. There's one thing they've done right, though: The cards are MtG-size, so if you are into using card protectors, they fit perfectly.

Wargamers probably dig this. Spending 60 EUR for crappy components and having to waste a week applying stickers to wooden blocks just isn't my idea of having a good time. Most of all, the gameplay just is not fun. There's just too much unnecessary complexity, and the components are ugly and unusable.

Richard Borg does it again with his 3rd installment of the Commands & Colors game system!  C&C Ancients still has the great gameplay of it's predecessors but has more types of units and greater depth.  A great light wargame for playing ancient battles. I have the 2nd edition printing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A fantastic system with lots of differentiation between the units. A realistic system that is extremely playable and fun. The board quality is poor, but GMT added a hard mount board to Expansions 2 and 3.

RATING: 8.5
While I think this only approximates a real ancients battle, it's a great system. Most of the strategic considerations are hard-baked into the system itself, so even a simple battle has lots of opportunity for clever tactical maneuvers. My opponent was up 4-2 in VP, and with some luck and desperation I managed to jump up 5-4 in the last couple of turns to steal the win in our first game.

Playing much more via Vassal. I really like this game, though the combined card and dice luck elements can frustrate from time to time.

I own "Memoir '44," so the rules and game play system aren't completely foreign to me, but there is definitely more complexity to this than to the WWII title. It's closer to a medium complexity rating than light-medium, depending on what players are accustomed to.

On the other hand, the game design seems better lent to ancient combat than WWII and therefore feels more accurate as a simulation. Once set up, playing the scenarios doesn't take much time. 

My only beef with the game is that the card draws (for commands) can be either restrictive or not applicable to a given situation on the board, which can be slightly frustrating. 

Received my copy via mail in February of 2008. Purchased Expansion Set #2, "Rome vs. the Barbarians" in December of 2010. Increased my rating from 8 to 9 after completing play of all the scenarios in the basic game. 

Similarly, after playing more of the scenarios from the "Barbarians" set, based on the balance between ease and complexity of play, components and how great the game looks, and the fun in playing, I raised my rating to '9.5'. The designer did a tremendous job of balancing ease of play with complexity, strategy, and luck, all into a quick-playing war game that also has very nice components. Plus it just looks beautiful laid out on a table so in this case I give Days of Wonder Company an extra half-notch for the aesthetic quality of its components--especially the mounted board for the "Barbarians" expansion. 

Allow a whole lot of time (2-3 hours?) for applying stickers to the hundreds of wooden blocks that come with the game.

The 'clumpy' movement dictated by the CDG mechanic just frustrates me.  Rating based on one play of Epic.  Epic rules with 5 players and the 'clumpyness' translates into a boring time for at least some of the players, so I'm willing to try this again with just two.

Its a wonderful cosim with loads of stuff (army-blocks, command-cards, dices, terrain-tiles and a very good scenario-book). As i really like card dirven games, C&C allways finds its way on our table.

A lot more meat then Memoir 44 ... In fact, it can be said that this game is Memoir 44 on steroids ... Lots of fun ... Plenty of options and choices and scenarios ... Every time we have pulled this on off the shelf ... we always play 3, 4, or more games ... But my God ... tons of stickers for both sides of 100s of blocks ... but once that seemingly endless task is completed ... it is worth the effort. After many, many plays ... I have to finally award this game a 10 (only the 2nd game I have ever rated a 10) ... This game takes an adaptable war gaming system to a high level. Win or lose, I have enjoyed EVERY game I have played. And ... I just had to go an pre-order the next of the series. If you have not played this one yet, you have got to give it a try very soon. Worth every penny and every sticker that has to be applied.

A fun system for beginners; attractive components and generally simple and logical rules. However I didn't really take to the card driven system and the frustrating limitations it imposes on players. With commands like 'activate 3 units on the left flank', all too often arbitrary situations would develop which saw a straggler or two left languishing at the rear of the battlefield.
I like limitations on players in wargames, and a measure of unpredictability reflecting the chaos of the battlefield, but I think something like a chit-pull system, as used in Richard Berg's Chariots of Fire (a much more complicated game than this), does a better job than C&C style cards.

Solid, but not my favourite in the family. The oodles of different troop types provide thematic appeal and enhances possibilities for tactical nous, but slows the game down. The hit-back and side-by-side support features encourage historically correct strategic formations.

RATING: 7
If you can accept the concepts and limitations of the system (i.e.; generalizations in the weapon systems, randomness through the card draw which limits what you are able to do, etc.), then this is a game to be enjoyed and appreciated. That sounds like a backhanded compliment but it really is not. As a game, it has a lot going for it. It is fun (always a major plus), can be played by two experienced wargamers in an hour or two and is easy to explain to a new gamer. The mountains of scenarios helps as well. I gave it a seven because it is a game that I do enjoy playing.

On the other hand, if you are a student of ancient warfare, you can appreciate GBoH because it clearly teaches you about the different army's weapons systems and how they would work (or not work) against an opposing army. If you are looking for this in C&C: Ancients, you are looking in the wrong place. Ultimately, it comes down to what you want in an ancients game.

I enjoy this a lot more than memoir44. The the mechanics really fit this era of warfare. I like the additions to the rules as well.

Rec'd in trade Feb 2010, w/2nd and 3rd expansion + End of Trium. for Goa, Attika, and Antike. Big thick boxes, attractive components... now to find opponents.

Oct 2014: In early 2014, I agreed to a trade with a guy on BGG named Andy Glass, of Kentucky. I gleefully shipped my copies of this game and two expansions, complete with $20 worth of hard plastic storage cases for the pieces in exchange for some nice Euros I was looking to try (Fleet, Burxelles, Copycat).

Then... Nothing.

Andy Glass disappeared, along with $150 worth of my games.

BGG thankfully locked his account after my protest. But I have not seen my games, nor have I bothered to try to chase him down any further.

My only sad and bad experience trading or selling games on BGG or even eBay. I had failed to check his prior trades, as someone else HAD complained about something that went wrong.

As of Oct 2014, his account has been deleted. There is another Andy Glass of Kentucky that has a profile on the 'geek, but he has not logged in as of 2012, with no activity (shell account?).

Cavet emptor.

Pros:
+Quality GMT written rulebook.
+TONS of little wooden blocks.
+Lots of depth in strategies.
+Tons of expansions will make this game awesome.
+Way more depth than Battle Cry.

Cons:
-Stickering all them little dudes was a pain in the ass. Took us together almost an hour each.
-Too many guys look too similar to each other.
-Artwork is not that great.
-Map is pretty bland.

Overall, I really enjoy this game and after a second play with Jen, she seemed to like it a lot better. I really also enjoy this game solo.

This was the first wargame I purchased and so far one of my favourites. Has very interesting set of rules and lot of unit variability. The rules and gameplay give the feeling of fighting an ancient battle very well. You have to hold the line - there are lot of cases where linked units in one continous line are much stronger than single units. Shooting units aren´t very strong and can be overrun if they do not fall back. Also the leaders are very important asset and give other units a lot of bonuses and more options to engage and survive. This game plays quickly and is very engaging.

Wow! Amazing game!  

The game is dripping with theme and the C&C system is really perfect for the period.  

Battlelore was a big disappointment, Memoir 44 is fun, and this is the one masterpiece in the whole line.  

How can you not love a game that allows you to remake the battle of cannae in 1h.30m and finnisth it with a feeling of utter satisfaction, after beating hannibal by a nose? 

All that sticking really paid off and I'm getting all the expansions! :)

I was amazed.

Thematically this hits both Memoir and Battlelore immediately off the board. I mean, these mechanics fit better in the ancient struggles. 

And don't get me started with that help sheet... It's just magnificent! There is everything you need except the evade. Only get to know where to find the things on the help sheet and youre 7/8 there!
It's clear, repetitive enough and informative.
Terrain could have had some help cards or something as in Memoir/Battlelore...
The map is a bit lame. It can't really be bended well. I hope to get better map one day ...or at least a glass on top of it.

Adding those stickers to 300+ blocks... I found it fun. =p
Can't wait to do same in the expansions..! I only wish that stickers were pre-attached to dice, it was harder to fit those in their small compartments. Art in units' stickers were REALLY beautiful by the way. 

All in all, this was a great experience. Playing time was about 40-60min/scenario and replayability is of course very high. The only drawback is the time-consuming setup time, which takes about 10-15min or something. A lot compared to the playing time (But it's still worth it.)

I'm just a bit confused about my actions. Don't know why I gave this 9 instead of 10? Well, a few more plays and I think I'll be more reasonable.

I enjoy this game, but I'm not sold on the Commands & Colors system. I don't like that there are no ways to cycle cards or that it's fairly common for one player to simply get better draws from the shared command deck. If one player draws the cards than activate more units or give bonuses to attack, they'll have a huge advantage. I think I would prefer separate decks and a discard mechanic. For example, I prefer the card systems used in CC:E and Manoeuvre to this one. That said, I do enjoy the tactical nature of the game and the way it deals with different unit types.

I'm really not into wargames (and maybe C&C isn't a true wargame), but this is pretty ok. I prefer the Memoir Incarnation and probably will like Battlelore even more, but that's just treatment and theme (the GMT production values aren't really to my liking). It's pretty heavy on the luck, with cards and dice and everything, but the relatiely short playing time makes up for it.

2 plays; Rating -8-
I've played quite a bit of Memoir '44 and BattleLore, so when there were just two of us at a recent game night, I jumped at the chance to try out this highly-regarded implementation of the system. I understand that GMT is not Days of Wonder and that they tend to put function over form, but I missed the lovely art of the more "mainstream" Memoir and BattleLore. My complaint extends slightly beyond the whining of a spoiled child of DoW and FFG, as the art of the units made it difficult to distinguish them. There were a few instances where I lost track of which type of unit I controlled or was fighting. Finally, I was glad my opponent had picked up the expansion with the mounted board because the paper map included with his copy of the base game would have been even more of a let down.

All that aside, the game play was great. With my previous experience in the series, I did not find anything revolutionary here, but some of the additional rules for battle-back, trample, etc., made for a bit of a deeper experience. I quite enjoyed it and would happily play again, but I don't think this will be replacing BattleLore in my collection anytime soon.

RATING: 9
I'd give a 9 rating to the C&C system as a whole, but the ancient battles setting and simple elegance of the components particularly appeal to me so bump this up another notch. Haven't played it very much, but I'm fascinated by it and would love to get deeper into it.

close to masterpiece, just 'close to' because the rules governing cavalry are in need of deep revision, indeed they'd need to be stated sans phrase: the official handling of cavalry, especially light cavalry, bespeaks poor knowledge about ancient warfare machineries

Although much fiddlier than Battle Cry or Memoir '44, it's still the same game, so I'm very glad to play it.  I do prefer the other games though.  C&C Ancients feels cluttered with too many troop types, and many of them look the same.

RATING: 9
Awesome 2-player wargame with wonderful bits.  The game is a souped up Memoir '44, but better, as the theme (ancient warfare) seems to fit the mechanics and structure of the game better than WWII does.  More tactical options with more units.  I have only played the first scenario, and it was incredibly fun. The game is really compelling, and has more of a build-up, unlike M44, where there aren't as many "investment" movement turns.  Probably the most fun I've had playing a wargame in a long time.

The components themselves are nice enough, but the artwork is pretty cheap. This is the same system found in Memoir 44. I think that's the better game, but this one is certainly quite popular. One difference is that this has leaders, which are interesting, gameplay wise. Like Memoir 44, the setup time for this is a bit high

Owned for 5 years and strangely I've yet to get this on a table.  As a long-time (25 year) player of ancients miniatures games, it seems like it would be hard for blocks and hexes to compete with my dozens of well-painted armies, model terrain, and bookshelf of rules-sets (including several I have designed myself).  From reading the rules, I appreciate the game's simplicity.  I need to get this to the table.

An excellent game made with quality components (ok, the dice are horrible, but I made my own and the Valley dice are nice as well) that gives one the feel for the period.  Two expansions now supply the missing hard mounted map.  Excellent support from GMT, many scenarios to choose from.  A simple and elegant system for Ancients that even this old grognard ancients player enjoyed.

Admittedly, only one play, but it was bad enough I intend to never play again.  First off, it's a very ugly game.  Second, it's far more complicated that it needs to be; too many charts, and the dice were apparently made to be as difficult to use as possible.  Third, I spent the whole game burning cards, trying to draw movement I needed.  The last three turns of the game my opponent slaughtered my left flank while I drew in vain, trying to find a card to at least activate that flank.  Any game that can create such a meaningless one-sided route is a failure, and the fact that it's a cludgy eyesore doesn't help.

Firstly, there is some high quality production with this game - primarily in the rulebook, reference sheets, and box itself.  The blocks are OK, wouldn't say they are abnormally good or anything, and applying the stickers?  Yeah, that sucks.

Getting past that, this is a very, very delightful block wargame that really picks up where M'44 left off.  There are a lot more options for command, and the scenarios are quite fun to play.  Units are mobile, lots of melee, 'battle back' retaliation and evading are good things to me.  Truly a game of positioning - utilizing the flanks, the correct units, and leader support.  I will be buying the army expansions for this game when available, and I will continue to play this whenever suggested.  It is a 2 player game by nature, and I won't fault the game for that, but because it is only for 2 players it won't get as much table time as I would like.  Excellent.  Pick it up, but don't buy it retail fer cryin out loud!  Get it online, where the price is much more reasonable.

Finally a theme well suited to Borg's C & C system.

My rating has gone up after repeated plays, the strategy in the game is surprisingly subtle, much more so than in M '44 or BC.  Rating has gone up after multiple playings

Remove the 'lore' from Battlelore and you have C&C Ancients. I enjoy the addition of the magic (as it adds an additional complexity to the game) and so I prefer Battlelore. Either one is an acceptable game. The problem I have with the system is the scope; every battle is on such a small scale that it is difficult to associate the battles with the real history. Finally, the blocks drive me nuts - the symbols are so damn small that they are difficult to see. I much prefer the Battlelore flags which are very easy to identify.

RATING: 8
This is a two player war game, where each side gets a pre-set army made up of wooden blocks, and then each player takes their turn playing a card to command one or more of their army groups, then draws a new card. There's some substantial luck here in that the cards you draw determine which armies can act, and combat is dice based, although it's an interesting dice system, not normal dice but dice that has the color of the target printed on it, with increased hit chances depending on if a general is near them. That being said, the luck didn't bother me as in the case of the cards, you have a big hand, and can usually do something relevant. In the case of the dice, there's strategic mitigation if you position yourself right, and also, a unit still hits at 100% it's strength even if there's only a single block left in it, which really mitigates a lot of the die luck. I found the game to be extremely interesting in terms of tactics, and I hope to play this more, although it's rare I wind up playing in 2 player groups.

My opponent commented that the system was similar to Memoir 44, but more complicated and interesting as this game has more unit types. I don't plan to explore other games, since CC Ancients has so much content for it, and I'm thematically turned off by games that feature any kind of modern warfare.

RATING: 8.5
[FROM 2009]

Very pleasant game.  Pieces feel fine, but set-up is a burden unless you have a tackle-box or something to divide up the units.  A fun game and an excellent utilization of the Commands & Colors system.  However, although the gameplay mechanics are very solid, the scenarios included tend to be a bit slanted towards one side.

[UPDATE 10-25-14 / SCORE UPPED FROM 7 TO 8.5]

I hadn't played this in ages until a friend broke it out and enticed me.  It was a heck of a lot of fun and I was surprised at how well the rules and unit stats remained familiar in my memory.  I ended up playing the first scenario 5 times over the next weeks and really began to grasp the strengths of the different units more so than I recall originally when I zoomed through the scenarios without repeat plays.  I ended up buying a new copy(love the new mounted board) and have had many enjoyable sessions with my wife since.

RATING: 7
I've played this a few times and must say I enjoy it more than Memoir 44. Although Memoir has the much better production value and the pieces and board are difinately light years ahead of this one. The rules on C&A are what make this game shine and take it up a level over memoir 44. The commanders battle rating, the bonus hits with commanders in a battle group, morale and support rules as well as the ability to evade make this a much more strategic game.

A wonderful combination of components, rules, unit diversity, and theme. Remember, just play for the experience, don't expect balanced scenarios (which would be so easy to do by altering the number of 'flags' needed). A few rules quirks and the lack of 'depth' to the board has lowered this from a 10.

RATING: 10
I own Memoir44 and Battle Cry and this is another great addition.  I enjoy the realistic scenarios that are not 'balanced' - this isn't fantasy gaming (which I've never really understood) - but a game that teaches about history.  I like to play my sons (11 and 16).  I take the 'historical' loser's side when playing my youngest - that way he almost always wins - I can also try new strategies.  With my older son it's no mister nice guy - he kicks my %#^$, so I need the 'historical' winner and then don't need to do anything stupid.

I've noticed that the Ancients scenarios are more 'unbalanced' than Memoir44 or Battle Cry.  My youngest really likes Battle Cry because of the quick setup and the figures.  I'm no grognard, just someone who really likes historical gaming, but never could find a 'fun' wargame - that's what I consider CC: Ancients - 'fun'!

One thing I dont like is the blocks that has no reason as it can be replaced by something more practical like chits or miniatures, the stickers also are pain to stick.

The C&C system seems to be a natural fit to the Ancient era. The use of the 3 zones for the cards, cards for the different unit types, leaders allowing lines of troops to move... All give a lot of flavor to the game.

Found this to play more true to its era. The rules seem to promote historical tactics. Keeping lines of troops to take advantage of leaders and supporting units, use of light troops to disrupt by fire.. 

If you want to try C&C - forget the rest get Ancients you won't be disappointed.

Kilóg a játékaim közül, mert elsősorban "Euro"-s vagyok. Úgy gondolom, hogy nyitok az ilyen játékok fele is, mert - bár meglepett - a páromnak is elképesztően bejött, pedig nem szereti a konfrontációt. Ezek után kíváncsi vagyok a Napoleon-i csatákra is.

Played Keith in July of 06.  It is a fun system.  Nice short games.  However, it does not give me that wargaming satisfaction.  It is more of a game.  The cards add flavor, but the game is too short.

Any more thoughts?  July 08?  No, not really.  It is a solid 6.

One of my favorites. It's fairly light for a wargame and the rules are easy to pick up, but the card management and tactics are always engaging and fun. The expansions add tons of new maps and special rules if you get bored of the base set. The only thing that could be considered a downside is that one poor decision can really ruin your day, but that's war!

RATING: 10
Really enjoying CC:A now after one year sitting on the shelf. Games are fast paced, tense and - best of all - work well when you use tactics from the ancients period. Leaders are essential to success, the scenarios are historically accurate (if often imbalanced) and the rules have just enough meat to take the game into simulation mode. Better than Battlelore, if only for leaders and the excess flab the lore cards bought. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Light mechanics and very playable... battlefield is divided into left, center, and right with modular terrain... cards provide a good "fog of war" feel with orders for one or more flanks or types of units... scenarios are excellent and game play works just as well online... only complaint is putting all those stickers on the blocks and the lack of a mounted board in the base game... rules are nicely mated to the excellent theme... would play this one anytime

RATING: 10
Awesome. For me, the best game in my collection. Although my wife and my dad have provided semi-willing opposition, historically the bulk of my plays used to be on Vassal. More recently C&C has become a regular at game night with my mate and we have been having a blast playing through all of the scenarios.

A brilliant game. Only two very slight dings I could think of: Light cavalry is destroyed a bit too often when retreating and a few rule interpretations relative to Leaders require clarification by online forum consensus.

I'm just learning the game, but I have a comment or two about the rulebook.

While the rulebook appears to be very well-written, but seems amazing that it lacks both a table of contents and an index.   I find myself flipping through the rulebook trying to find a particular rule....

Secondly, the rules applying to a particular movement-and-battle seem spread around the rulebook.   I think this is probably necessary, given how the game engine works, and it is not a criticism of the rulebook, but I find my first pass through a play to result in quite a few visits to the rule book.

After nine games, I'm rating this a '9'.   It's hella fun!

I love this game.  It took me a bit longer to get into the  game than Memoir 44, but Ancients is a much richer experience.  New players will have fun, but to truely get the right feeling in the game, it takes a number of plays.  It is important to understand how the leaders, formations and cards work together as opposed to cards and terrian in Memoir 44.  This is turning to be one of my favorite games!

(Note to self: The number of plays on the base game refers to all plays including the expansions)

A sadly dry theme, but the best tactical battle game (including the thrill of dice rolling!) you can play in under an hour.  The overall mechanics also trump the other Borg designs (Memoir 44, Battlelore).  Note, the expansion scenarios are also better than the base set.

Shameful disclosure:  I owned this game for 11 years before it ever hit the table. As expected, the game does not disappoint.  Having played several other games in the C&C family, I knew the game would be good. This will be a  permanent fixture in my collection. Rules have been updated to meet latest edition; looking forward to many games ahead. Now, if I can just keep these 1st edition stickers from falling off!!

Rating based on three plays so far, plus my familiarity with Memoir '44 which is also based on the Commands and Colors system. Both are excellent games. C&C:A adds special rules for leaders, "line" commands, and the Battle Back feature, all excellent additions. Haven't gotten into elephants yet, but I'm looking forward to it! My rating may rise after more plays.

RATING: 8
I really enjoy this - the battles are quick and atmospheric - and most importantly "feel" like proper battles. I love the look and feel of the blocks, and the slightly old-style feel to the graphics. A couple of the cards feel a tad overpowered, but the short playtime helps make this matter less.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
 This is a wonderful addition to the C&C system, as it adds more strategy and finesse than the previous games (and THOSE are good!).  Admitted bias as I know designer.  Yes, one has to take time to "peel n place" all the stickers, but you know, sometimes a little effort and time in the set-up results in a bit more appreciation for what's in the package.   And with this system, it's incredibly easy to design your own battles or use for resolution of battles in DIY Campaigns.

RATING: 7
The best of the series. Could have used dotted blocks (Europe Engulfed, FAB: The Bulge, etc...) to reduce number of wooden blocks and setup time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great game that involves a great deal of tactical thinking to win.  Especially against an opponent who knows how to play right.  The units are accurately represented in that the lighter units get decimated in close combat but are fast and nimble.  The heavier units are more powerful but trudge across the battlefield at a snails pace.  I would give a higher rating if not for the poor production quality of some of the bits.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A nice, fast moving tactical system. Nicely boils ancient combat down to a fairly straightforward system that refuses to bog itself down with details. This isn't meant as a thorough study of the subject, and does more than well enough at what it *is* meant to be.

RATING: 8.1
This is the one wargame that I would be willing to play regularly if I had the chance. It is relatively short, while not trading off any of the complexity and feel you expect from wargames. My first try was so positive that I ran to buy a copy!
I have not played enough games to appropriately rate this game but I still can raise my rating from 7 to 8 (although, these days, I would always want to play!).

THE BEST (?) LIGHT WAR GAME
I LOVE this game.  I was (and remain) a big fan of Memoir 44 before I played CC&A.  I found those who ruminated on the superiority of CC&A over Memoir '44 a bit tedious, particular those who have made comments to the effect that CC&A does the superior job of reproducing the feel of combat in its respective era (as if they have any real idea).  That said, I find that I have come to prefer C&CA although I still play and enjoy Memoir 44.  I think there is room for both in the collection of any fan of lighter wargames.

RATING: 7
Lots of work to finish all of the 300 plus blocks. First scenario was too straightforward (no terrain to make things more interesting). I like it even though I lost. I have a feeling my rating may go up after more plays. In general, though, I am more into strategic games. This is a strictly tactical game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Revised rating up for three reasons:

1) Stopped expecting it to be Battle Cry. I enjoy maneouvering in terrain, so I was initially put off by the open battlefields of C&C:Ancients. Now I see the texture comes from the various unit types, not the terrain.

2) I've read a lot about ancient warfare in the last few years, so I have a lot keener appreciation for the subject.

3) I played enough games that I'm now comfortable with the mechanics for the various unit types, and how to manage them. 

==========================================

Feels more tactically sound than Battle Cry or Memoir '44. However, the battles all feel too similar for much replay value. Substantially increased complexity and fiddliness compared with Battle Cry does not yield corresponding increase in depth.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Have played it 6 times so far, and found it pretty engaging each time.  A nice uptick in complexity (but not too much) from Battle Cry and Memoir '44, this game has so many scenarios coming that I can foresee playing this repeatedly for some time, to the exclusion of the more complicated fare that is SGBOH or GBOH.  Sure it's pretty random, but you still need to understand how to use the units effectively (not that I do yet...can't figure out how to use cavalry in an effective manner).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I really want to like this, and I do, but I can't help feeling that most of our games degenerate into a contest to see who's best at chasing the enemy's 1 block units around the board.  

Oct 14 - the above still holds true, but I really like this game anyway....hence all the expansions. In fact the more I play this the more it grows on me, despite the obvious luck factor it still feels like there is plenty of scope for strategic choices to ensure the odds work for you as much as possible.  Bumped to 9.

This is exactly what I awaited from an Ancients battle game :
- easy to learn (and to teach to non wargamers)
- quick to play
- more depth than one could believe at first sight
- a "design for effect" that leads to a feeling and understanding of the battles fought that much more complicated and long games (e.g. GBoH) give you.
- nice aesthetics, no marker clutter (vs. the ugly marker covered units in GBoH) and minimal data on the playing pieces (I really don't like ancients units full of numbers).

(6/6/08) - I had been waiting C&C: Ancients for many months now. After holding off on buying it for almost 8 months, I couldn't wait any longer and went nuts.

(6/16/08) - [9] - With 4 plays under my belt I am ready to rate this. All I can really say is that if Richard Borg stopped making games altogether starting today, this game would be his crowning achievement. I had read that the C&C system is best suited for this era of combat and now I completely agree. Battle-backs make you pay dearly for careless attacking. The leader mechanic excellently simulates an inspiring individual guiding their men to victory. I have little doubt that this will eventually become a 10 with more plays.

After having played Hannibal and others, a friend and me have recently purchased a larger batch of 2- player Card Driven games. This one opened the festival for us, and it's relative simplicity and depth made it a good game. For some reason I do feel the control is limited though. The rolling of loads of dice does normally not scare me, but for some reason it is putting me off in this one.

Already bought, but yet to try: Twilight Struggle, Paths Of Glory, Hammer of the Scots and Here I Stand (multiplayer)...

I have played Memoir44, BattleLore, and this game and out of the three I prefer BattleLore.  Ancients was very nice to play and has the widest variety of units, but I like the fantasy theme and the addition of magic to the standard mix of warfare in the command & colors system.

Great game. I was suspicious of the blocks and if it would be worth having this and M44. Applying all stickers was quite a feat and I did not care for the flyweight dice (I popped them open and stuck in a block of maple wood - much better). The map is chinsy but I guess most grognards are used to paper maps so the thin card board is sort of a step up.

Having now played, I like the blocks just fine. I like the game better than M44 in terms of the added complexity (battle back, retreat, elephants, etc.). However, I'd never give up M44 as I love the WWII genre - I just bought the expansions for my boys for Christmas. Not sure if I'll need the C&C expansions - they'll need some very special extras to get me to plunk down the cash especially in view of Battlelore coming soon.

Borrowed. Loved. Will buy.

Edit: Bought. Still love. Won't lend.

Edit 2: I must confess that a fair amount of my enjoyment of this game comes from how the theme shines through. We've all seen movie scenes where generals push around troop models on sand or a map with one of those pokey things they have. That's what this game does for me. It lets me be Caesar. Pushing my troops around with... a spatula or whatever I have on hand. I love it!

I'm a great big nerd for the Total War-series of computer games, and this is the closest approximation of the real time Battles of those games I've found in board games. But it's a great game in its own right too! Just a perfect fit for me.

This is a great game. My rating may go up after a few plays.
My real gripe about this game is GMT's production of it. Im sorry. Most items are cheap including the board, the terrain, and OMG the DICE.
For what they ask in price, this game does not deliver on components. Only the great gameplay from Richard Borg saves this game.

I think the leaders really make this more innovative than the other C&C games. very enjoyable and tons of expansions.

Only played the first scenario a couple of times to get a feel for the game. I liked the way it played, similiar to Battle Cry, but with more detail and complexity in the rules. 

After a few more plays I am pretty sure that if I had my choice I would play Napoleonics or Battle Cry. The rules and style to me are a better representation of linear musket tactics. 

Still a good game, but hasnt gotten much play time. 

Dropping my initial 6 rating to a 4. This game has gotten no play time and I dont expect it too in the future.

I feel the basic C&C system is more applicable to ancients warfare anyway, so I think that alone makes for an improvement of theme.  Other added rules also make for more realistic ancient combat.

Numerous troop types (For realism's sake there were a lot of different types/qualitiies of units in ancient armies.) also add a level of comlexity. I think most wargamers will appreciate the detail.  I only wish there were a few more scenarios.

Didn't like the mechanics of this one.  Why do units get destroyed if they cannot retract backwards?  Why does cavalry need so much room to retreat.  Why must I wait to draw a card to give orders to a particular area?  Also, the die rolling can really screw up a good play.

I can see why some people like it, and I've tried to give it the benefit of the doubt, but every time I play I just always am thinking "Why am I not playing Memoir 44 instead?"  Albeit M44 is my favorite game, so it's hard to compete, but the wide variety in troops, the seemingly random stats (light cavalry retreat 4 spaces per flag - willingly falling off the "cliff" on the end of the board?), the wide variety in card strength (activate 2 units vs some that can activate 6+ or an entire line), the lack of interesting or good terrain (hills are bad for both offense and defense?), etc. etc.  just wreck it for me.  If I want "Ancient" theme, I'd take Battlelore, but really my time is better spent playing more M44! Did I say how good M44 is?

--Oct2009-- Nice clean update of the ongoing C&C system.  I like this one best of all the instances in the system:  the combat mechanics seem to suit Ancient warfare a bit better than WW2; the cards seemed more sensible than those of Battle Cry; the minis are less appealing to me than the blocks.  I'm a bit sad I invested in Memoir '44, 'cause I don't need two instances of the system.

This game gets more interesting the more you play: it's difficult at first to really get the interaction between the different unit stats, but once you get the hang of it, the game gets competitive and tense, even considering the built-in assymetry!

RATING: 6
My first plays left me slightly disappointed as I felt too much was driven by the cards and -- perhaps to a lesser extent -- the dice. A recent session has caused me to re-examine that view: it's light fun with quick play that requires a certain amount of thought; the thinking man's beer and pretzel's game, almost.

My two criticisms remain, however. Relative to the short play time, the set up seemed long, while (perhaps more importantly) relative to the game's simplicity, there seemed to be a lot for non-gamers (the people who I'd most want to play this with) to remember regarding the different types of units. Therefore it's not really the very simple gateway wargame it could have been.

Nevertheless, my recent experience of the game does leave me wanting to play other iterations of the Borg series, both simpler (Battle Cry) and slightly more complicated (C&C: Napoleonics). I can't see myself ever picking up the expansions, though.

Enjoyable and fast to play (though setup can be fiddly -- I keep my pieces in a plastic organizer to speed it up). It reflects many of the tactical realities of ancient combat in a streamlined, entertaining fashion, promoting proper support of your units, proper placement of leaders and emphasizing the deadliness of heavy troops when they can catch up with light infantry.

Fun.

If you are familiar with Memoir 44', then this game should be fairly easy for you to grasp. There are more unit types: Light, medium and heavy infantry/cavalry. Leaders are also added and have some good effects when combined with a unit. The blocks look nice when moved around on the board, almost like legions of troops arranged on a real battlefield seen from above. I play with my 12 y/o son and he really likes this game. I am sure after I have played this game more the rating will go up.

I have a copy of this that I've played three times.  It's too highly rated for me to consider dumping it without giving it another chance, but too little fun to play to give it many more chances.

Of all the highly rated games I've played, this is maybe the one whose appeal I understand the least.

Update: I traded this for Space Alert.  I am very happy with said trade.

Unit variation and a good card set make this a game where you'll be thinking about manoeuvring your units to outflank and break your opponent up. Keeping your troops together in line and adjacent to leaders with effective use of different unit types keeps you thinking. The hand management is vital - setting up a powerful combination for an attack that you'll be able to carry through with - more important than in Memoir 44.

After a couple of games the rules become very clear and you'll find yourself breezing through scenarios without referencing rules or reference sheets.

I'm extremely interested in the history here - there are some fantastic podcasts and documentaries on these battles and the strategies, tactics, unit makeups and leadership behind it all. I prefer games over simulations, and while I wouldn't want too many games this streamlined, what it lacks in minute detail it makes up for with pure gaming fun.

I thought initially this would be too similar to Memoir 44 for me to own both, but after playing both in the same week I see room for both in my collection. Good stuff and I actually quite like the blocks.

This is a fantastic game and system.  I like everything about it from the blocks to the cards to the modules containing armies from different time periods.
The tactical level feels right without bogging things down by trying to be a full simulation of the time period.
I like the way the cards dictate the actions.  Good hand management is important but not vital, knowing the cards like some CDG's is not necessary so the tempo of the action stays high throughout the game.  Anything scenario based I like, and this system contains a nice supply of variety, granted not always balanced, but the switch sides mechanic nicely takes care of that and since the game plays quickly, playing each side of the scenario is not a problem and a fun aspect not seen in many tactical games.
Then there are elephants, how can you not like a game with fighting elephants?

RATING: 9
Light, fast, and random.  I've been steamrolled as a result of poor dice rolls and unbalanced scenarios.  That, however, is not always a bad thing, after all this is warfare in the ancient period.  We struggled a bit at first but now the game plays fast and smooth.  I love the wooden blocks, they add to the ancient theme, and look great on the board.  The fog of war produced by the card driven commands is tense and you can always play a card from your hand.  Over time I suspect this rating to go up, a very solid game that is becoming an addiction and a fast favorite.

UPDATE: 8 to a 9.  After playing one on one epic, we can't get enough of this.  Love the epic rules and table top layouts with tons of blocks!  We really enjoy watching the ebb and flow of the front lines with the battle back and evasion rules.  Great history lessons, easy on the eyes, and we always look forward to the next game.

Played once so far with my wife.  We enjoyed this game fine, but it was tough to slog through the rules during our first play.  I should mention that each turn sequence is fairly simple, but there's a lot of variability between particular units, and we had our noses firmly planted in the reference sheets.

We will play again, with reversed sides, and hopefully it will go a little quicker the second time around.  Once we get used to the rules, and try a few more scenarios, I expect that the rating will rise.

I REALLY want to get the 2nd expansion (Rome vs. Barbarians), having grown up with Asterix comics as a kid.

I've gotten more bang per buck out of this than any game in the past decade. 

Now I have played almost all the scenarios a half a dozen times. For me the immersion factor and tension level is very high.

Complexity and game length are almost perfect.


My main gamer friend is very very good at getting some opportunity out of any hand. There is more depth in this than M'44, more than some give it credit for.


Note: We lay the blocks flat. It looked as good or better that way versus standing.

I pre-orderered this from the GMT P500 almost a year before release. I look forward to playing. I like the addition of leaders. Some of the unit variety is interesting, in particular elephants. Retreat rules are harsher than M44, as are ranged attacks. Components are kinda bad, I mean placing labels on both sides of 350 blocks is no fun at all, the map isn't mounted, the dice are cheap, and for some strange reason they didn't annotate the labels with attack ratings or anything to help you remember the rules. I'd rather have minis since that's the case. Anyhow, the rules are intriguing, and I can't wait to try it.

At first glance, seems shallow...  Wrong.  There are many tactics to discover.  Great tactile feel with the blocks which differentiates it from its peers (is it really a miniatures game?).  I wonder at the feasibility of fog of war mechanics (stickers on only ONE side!).

Fast playing, simple rules where the depth is in the interactions between units and some of the scenario special rules.

Many have expressed that the strength of the system is in the scenarios and now that I have a lot more plays under the belt I'm seeing that.  There are a lot of cool scenarios.

Block stickering was a chore but darn if the blocks don't look good on the table.  Not too impressed with the board but seeing as the expansions have mounted ones (can't wait for Epic) I'm not too concerned.

This kind of thing frustrates me.  The added chrome to the basic C&C system is very welcome, and appropriate to the era.  I really like the Command Card mix.  The unit types are well differentiated.  But the graphic development fumbles on the 1-yard line: how can you ID units by color/shape, and then have different units with the same symbol have different abilities?  Surely there was a way to design the game without needing a double-sided sheet just to detail all the unit stats.  I do like the game, but this kind of functionality impairment drives me nuts.

CC:A is a card driven hex and counter war game. I don't mind the card driven aspect, although it can lead to some odd situations. The units are harder to tell apart than they should be, and they should have their stats on the stickers so you wouldn't have to look them up constantly.

In addition, the dice resolution mechanic used to evaluate attacks is too high variance and detracts from the experience. I don't tend to like dice resolution mechanics to be fair, but this one bothers me more than most.

A great block game.  It gives you the feel of miniutures without the paiting, though putting the hundreds of stickers on takes awhile.  The biggest drawback for me is the unevenness of the scenarios.  Your playing historically but the first several are pretty one sided.

Memoir'44 is really a gateway game for Ancients.  Much less luck factor even though you are still dealing with both dice AND cards.  Great strategy,  formations become much more important, and a great historical replay experience.  Epic battles for 2 on the table.

I'm new to Richard Borg games, but I have been blown away by just how elegant and fun C&C: Ancients is.  No, it's not GBoH, but you can blast through multiple playings in the time it takes to set up a GBoH scenario, and the results are surprisingly historical.  Highly recommended.

RATING: 5
It's quite an effort to label all those blocks, but once done, it looks good, and the blocks are much easier to play with and identify troop types than the plastic figures. The dice could use some heft. The game itself is fun, and feels a lot like Battlecry(obviously.) I've only played the intro scenario so waiting to rate until I've played with more troop types to see if the added troop depth is an actual improvement.

Update: I've played about half a dozen scenarios now and I find I want to play this less and less. The new troop types are interesting, but not enough to entice me to play often. Maybe my wargaming tastes are becoming more refined (or maybe just changing), but this system is appealing less and less. (Traded Away)

Most complicated and strategic gameplay in the C&C series, but a C&C game shouldn't be complicated; I'd rather move on to more fulfilling wargames than making 1-hour scenarios with a weird command scheme work. Memoir '44 is excellent for fulfilling the casual game niche.

Also disappointed that this game uses blocks, but not to introduce fog of war or to be put to some use that differentiates them from miniatures. They're just a poor substitute for minis; can't identify them quickly with a glance.

I had lots of fun in the couple times I've played it.

Solo play is fun too, trying to optimize each play (minus the first strike cards) for either Romans or Carthaginians.

What I like: the moderate level of complexity (variable powers for different troop types) and the dice-and-card combat system which limits and focuses what you can do each turn.

What I dislike: the limited power of ranged weapons and that many scenarios are quite unbalanced (for historical accuracy).

I do wish there were more scenarios with unique objectives such as "capture and hold spot X" or "get your leader across the board and escape past your opponent before the sixth turn". Most scenarios are simply battles of attrition...which is still hella fun, if just slightly one-dimensional.

Sold all on eBay.  I certainly gave these "card driven" tactical games a worthy try, can't say that I ever really liked them all that much, though I certainly made an effort to like them.  The sides are unbalanced in virtually every scenario, and there is no "handicap" system for the historical loser in any given battle.  Adding "luck" of cards drawn to the "luck" of dice rolls, plus in tournament play even more random "luck" of which side one randomly receives, is just not enjoyable to me.  I know some folks in tournaments play a specific set of more even battles, and must play each side, then add total banner count to determine the winner.  This seems much more reasonable to me, but unfortunately I never got to play this way.  In short, I'm "done" with the vast majority of games of this type, I'm going back to "old school" "hex and chit" wargames with CRT's.

Played o/l ("online") on WGR a week ago, JAN'14,...this game still just completely sucks!

Played a few times.  Even though we're very bad at it, we learn steadily, and more importantly it's always fun.

Having multiple small blocks to represent each unit seems redundant.  Larger blocks with hit point pips round the edge (like Columbia's games) would be far more suitable - making it quicker to set up, and easier to view the artwork.  This is a very light game after all; 10 minutes setup is too much for a 30 minute game.

A fine variant of the C&C system, not nearly as elegant as M44, but still a great light wargame. I was amazed how the new rules allow for a push and pull on the battlefield that you truly don't see in the other games. On the downside, after 4 games I'm still finding a lot of the game play elements confusing due to lack of good development.

[10 plays] It takes many games to get a good feel for the differences and additions to the ruleset from M'44 and Battle Cry (games which I know very well), yet we still find ourselves constantly looking things up on the chart and in the rulebook. Perhaps that would change if we played it quite regularly, but read on to see if that's likely ...C&C:A is too complicated for the amount of luck and chaos involved. It is too complex and lengthy for the amount of enjoyment it delivers. It took awhile, but I've soured quite a bit on this one in comparison with M'44 and Battle Cry. Those are much better balanced games in terms of fun, speed, complexity-vs-fun, and luck-vs-control ratio. This game can plod along for a time, then everything in an area dies and/or runs away, and then it plods again for awhile. The main culprit of that phenomena, I think, is the way this game handles "battling back".Well, that's one man's opinion, and this certainly is a very well made game despite the length of time it takes to sticker the blocks and the minor confusions therein in the 1st edition. Many people espouse the tactical options of the units and the generals, the need to pay attention to formations, and the rule chrome and so forth, but I think this is more dependent on card draw luck and dicefest results than it should be given the rules complexity.My copy is now up for trade/sale.Most recent play 2-4-07 with Garrett.

Do we need another game with the same system as Battle Cry, Memoir '44?? Hell yes!

The production value exceeds usual GMT quality: they might even have gotten better price breaks and quality if they made it in China.

The system will be familiar to fans of M'44 and Battlecry. There are now more troops and enough extra rules to make the whole experince gel better with the theme and yet not get bogged down with too much rules referencing.

The blocks can get a little 'samey' looking and some are a little on the small side. The dice could have been solid instead of hollow. But the game is so good I can overlook these faults.

Terribly over rated.  Find it boring. Battle masters 20 years ago (essentially the same system on a simpler card driven mechanic by MB) was better.

C&C:A is the beer-and-pretzels game you take home to mother. It seems to have found the perfect balance of quick-and-lite plus deep-and-meaningful.
 
While this may not be the most immersive game in my collection, nor does it provide the most compelling narrative, by game's end it feels like a lot has happened -- and has happened fast enough to allow another session.
 
To play it well, C&C:A requires something of you. It takes a little bit of patience, guile, and huevos. The game plays like a prize fight, the two sides sizing each other up early on then striking hard when the opportunity presents itself. Afterward, there's none of that gaming-fatigue you might get after playing an epic. None of that why-did-I-feast-on-Taco-Bell feeling after a quick skirmish.
 
Yet, the game's strength is also its weakness: While its hand-management rewards methodical play, it is a stretch to imagine it serving as a wargame's command and communication mechanic.
 
That is, you're often dealt a bad hand, and card cycling to improve it is one of the great rewards of the game. But that feels completely out of place with the theme. It robs the game of a satisfying narrative. The lasting image is of ancient generals (or their gods) sitting at the card table, not on the field commanding vast armies.
 
Still, I like the game lots, enough that I'm handcrafting the game's components to better-match what I think warfare at this scale should look like. Two last points I'd like to make:
 
1) I think (and I hope) C&C:A will be further popularized with future generations. It's not difficult to imagine this game appearing in one of those Air Mall magazines, lavishly produced in pewter, or the map as the top of a wooden bookshelf chest (to hold game pieces, a la Chess).
 
2) Even if this isn't the highest rated game in my collection, if ever stuck on a deserted island with only one board game to play, C&C:A would be a strong consideration.

C&C Ancients is exciting to play, and the duration of one game is just right. First lesson after Battlelore, keep your units close to leaders. Luck is less a factor here than in Battlelore. For me though the theme & variety with expansions make BL a slightly better game than Ancients and I really don't feel I need to own this as the games are (naturally) quite similar.

One more thing worth mentioning: Ancients summary sheet is excellent.

C&C: Ancients: when men were men, and elephants stomped all over them.

The Punic, or Phoenician, culture survives today in fragments. It provided the basic alphabet which became Greek in one location, and Arabic in another. Some have likened the Phoenicians to the Vikings of the Mediterranean, as they traveled widely and had a strong impact on local cultures, but didn't leave much in the way of written records for the scholars who would later write history books. Alexander spelled the end of Phoenician culture in the Middle East, yet Carthage in Northern Africa remained a stronghold of Punic religion, language, and culture. C&C: Ancients, is primarily a system - a system recreating ancient warfare. In the base game, the first few scenarios pit Carthage against Syracuse. Carthage was trading all over Sicily between 500 and 300 BC, and settling some on the western end of the island. The Greeks had also sent settlers. Settlers from Corinth established Syracuse, which would later rival Athens herself as a power in the region, and there was often conflict between the Hellenes and Carthage. The rest of the scenarios in the base game depict the Second Punic War, in which Hannibal marched up through Spain, across the mountains, and down into Italy (unfortunately feasting on elephant meat part of the way). The scenarios also depict the brilliance of Publius Scipio the Younger, who came to be called Scipio Africanus after his victories in Africa - the one at Zama ultimatley defeating Hannibal. Even though the scenarios here (all of which are assymetrical battles by the way) mostly allow the players to re-live the Second Punic War, one quickly sees that Borg's system will be able to nicely accomodate other ancient battles with ease.

Some grognards may call Ancients (perhaps derisively) a "lite" wargame. Sure, it doesn't take 6 hours to play, and involve a thousand fiddly components. But for me, I don't want that level of complexity, and I don't have the luxury of the free time necessary for those kinds of games - though I suspect I would enjoy some of them. Ancients boasts a degree of simplicity not found in many wargames, although it is apparently more complex than Battle Cry and Memoir 44, two earlier productions which bear a family resemblance to Ancients. In philosophy and science, simplicity is always in a theory's favor. It is a factor if excellence, such as explanatory power, or predictive ability. I think simplicity is also a virtue in game design, and here it helps Ancients shine. The game can be learned quickly, and you aren't going to forget the rules after a few plays.

The game boasts a great balance between abstraction and concreteness, as well as the kind of blend between luck and planning which I seem to favor. Unit movement is controlled by cards, and battle is resolved by die roles. So chance enters in prominently - but it is a sort of balanced chance - balanced by the differences between units and the distribution of cards in the deck. The challenge then becomes, much as it did in genuine ancient warfare, the flexibility of the minds behind the opposing sides. Competent generalship is more than planning well, it is being able to adapt successfully to change, all the while under tremendous pressure. Playing Ancients gives me the feeling of being able to exercise just such a virtue - although I do not claim to do it well!

Each scenario attempts to recreate the conditions of a particular historical battle, and so one side usually has an advantage (just as in life). Players can each switch sides in a given session if they wish. Or, like me, you can keep playing the underdog until victorious, darn it! The game is certainly a lot of fun if you simply approach the scenarios with a relatively blank mind. However, if you are interested in history and allow the scenarios to engage your imagination with respect to the flow of events and the setting, Ancients is the kind of game that you will have dreams about - during your sleep, and even your waking hours. The game also inspires the "just one more game" syndrome; this is a hallmark of my favorite games. It's safe to say that I might rate this a tad lower if it were the exact same system but some different theme. I *really* enjoy the ancient military angle.

Now I've said a lot of nice things, yet there is one thing about C&C:A which some people find off-putting, and that is how chance works in the game. Because you rely on a card draw to move units in the three parts of the battlefield (right, center, left), it is possible that you may have no cards to move left-flank units. Well, that isn't strictly true, as most cards will allow you to move a single unit of your choice if you can't perform the operation on the card. More accurately, luck of the draw may not provide you with any *good* options for moving your left-flank units. For players who like a large degree of control, and want to be able to move each unit at their discretion, this can be frustrating. Columbia's block games might be preferable to such a player, as you draw a card indicating the number of units you can move - but you can move *any* units you like, anywhere on the battlefield. I do not think inability to do this is a flaw in C&C:A, precisely. It's simply a matter of mechanical preference that will impact certain players' enjoyment of the game.

Component-wise, the blocks initially take a loooong time to sticker, but a) you can use this as meditation time, and b) the result is worth it. The blocks provide an excellent feeling, and fit the ancient period well. The dice, I could do without. I can't keep them on the table, it seems, and I hope better dice become available. The cards are excellent - stiff and with clear type and crisp art. Saying the box is stiff would do an injustice to the box. The lovely, glossy box which houses Ancients is the mightiest game box I have ever met. I could stand on it, and my forebears had names like "Trond the Red Menace" and "Lars Axe-Hurler". I like the artistic design, much of it done by the same artists who worked on Battle Line. The board is okay, it's thin but solid cardboard. I would pay extra for a nice mounted board, however. I'm looking forward to the expansions for this game.

My only real desire, however, is that I knew more people who liked to play this. Oh, here are some rules which are important, but which many either forget or get wrong:

1. A defending unit can ignore one retreat flag if there are two or more adjacent units, and may also ignore one retreat flag if a leader is attached to the defending unit. The total possible number of flags a unit can ignore is two.
2. If a unit retreats, but is blocked and so cannot move, and loses one or more blocks as a result but is still adjacent to the attacking unit, the retreated unit may battle back!
3. If a unit has an attached leader and that unit makes a momentum advance, it may attack again (because it has a leader) - even if it could not normally do so.
4. Read the rules for making checks on hitting leaders and everything about elephants very carefully.

RATING: 8
A very fast playing wargame.  Much faster to set up than Memoir 44 and Battle Cry due to the small geographical scale of the battles (because you're so "zoomed in", there isn't much terrain); however, the rules are far more complicated than either of its predecessors, enough to scare away any casual gamer and definitely move it out of the "Eurogame" category and into the "wargame" category.  That being said, the fast set up and play is a bonus offered by very few wargames, and the greater level of detail in the rules permits a far greater sense of realism at the expense of transparency (in other words, be ready to do a lot of flipping through the rule book)

I played it again, but it still seems overrated.  At least my defeats are quick.

Update: It's a higher-rated game when I play with my brother or perhaps someone else who really loves the game.  The biggest advantage to the game is that it plays quite quickly.  I'm not an expert on the tactics.  The shortness and simplification make the game free a bit too "chess-like", but it's certainly better than games like Manoeuvre.

Sajnos sok idővel a Memoir után tudtam csak kipróbálni a másik hasonló kártyavezérelt játékot, de így is sok minden rémlett még. Nagyon hasonló a két játék, de a C&C kicsit nehezebb. Többfajta egység, többfajta kártya. Nagyon szép fa egységek, kár hogy matricázott és nem vésett, ugyanígy a kockák is. Már az alapjátékkal is rengeteg játék játszható unalom nélkül. Nagyon magas újrajátszhatósági faktort érzek ebben. Izgalmas minden csata, ötletesek a kártyák. 1 óra alatt lemegy körülbelül egy. Kicsit nehéz az egységek átlátása elsőre, de 2-3 csata után már mindenki mindent tudhat. Nagyon tetszett ez is, ahogy a Memoir is. Most egy ponttal azért adok rá kevesebbet, mert a téma kevésbé áll közel hozzám, de lehet a Memoir pontja is változik még ha tudok vele még játszani. Mindkettőt könnyű szívvel ajánlom, nagyon jó kétszemélyes játékok a könnyedebb wargame-k közül.

RATING: 6
Frankly a bit disappointed with this one. In simplifying the rules, it manages to abstract away important parts such as the role of cavalry. The Numidians played a huge role throughout the Second Punic war but they're mostly a liability here. Takes a while to setup too so only makes sense if playing back-to-back games, but then I'd rather play a longer game. Finally, the provided player aids are not very helpful -- a much better one is available on BGG.

RATING: 3
More rules than M'44, but they seem to just make the game more dice driven.  I have no real love for the system, but I felt that at least M'44 was fast and furious and BattleCry pretty and thematic.  With C C:Ancients, I found playing with blocks made me want to play better games with blocks. 

Mostly I was just annoyed with the battle back system.  Rather than pushing a front hoping to exhaust those particular cards is now gone as when you attack they battle back system gives an attack back then they have another opportunity to attack with that same flank. This becomes an extreme irritation as whittled down forces still attack at full strength.

The more I play this system the more I appreciate the battle board from Bobby Lee. 

I was totally bored halfway through this, probably as a reaction to remove myself from caring about the absurd results of the dice.

On a positive note, the box is very thick.

This is a very clever game.  Relatively simple, yet surprisingly effective at capturing the feel of Ancient battle.  Although I do recommend it,it does have one major flaw:  luck plays an inordinate role in determining who wins and loses. 

Update: After 150 or so games in this system, I have become disenchanted with it.  Too much luck floating around between cards and dice, not enough history.  The ancients, in particular, don't feel quite right now.  Going back to Simple GBoH- which has its flaws, but at least looks/feels a bit like an Ancient battle.

There isn't any element of this game that is particularly new, but the overall package is superbly thought out, with nothing superfluous and just enough special cases to make meaningful differences between the different units. I think this might be the ancients battlefield game I have always wanted to play -- all the fun of miniatures without the fiddly stuff. It may be too soon to call it a classic, but I suspect this is one of those games you'll be pulling out of the closet to play with your kids a decade or two from now. I withhold a 10 only because I haven't played a lot of ancients games, and there might be a better one.

Full marks for the bits, as well. Apart from a few typos, the rules are excellent, and the blocks make a fine display.

4/28-
Finally got around to playing my first two games today and I was impressed. I am more of a Eurohead vs. a Grognard but I think that this game will either be an exception to the rule or a gateway into a brave new world. Its an elegant system that works very well and is not hard to grasp. I have played M'44 before but I found this game much more refined. I just wish they would have made some nice wooden dice to go along with the wooden block components.

UPDATE: 12/13 - played again for the first time in a long while. Forgot how wonderful the system is and will work on playing more often. A wargame I can sink my teeth into.

RATING: 10
This is a fantastic light wargame.  It's the only system I have ever played that can reproduce Cannae.  Games usually take about half an hour between experienced players.

Luck of the draw does make a big impact, but a better player will still win more often.

The system strikes a great balance between friction and planning.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I've played Memoir'44, Battle Cry, and now Commands & Colors. I like C&C best, BC second, and M'44 third. This is so even though I generally enjoy WW2 era games more than all of the others.

Great Points:
Even though the dice and the card draw are randomizers that can have a significant impact, strategy--keeping units together in formation, keeping leaders close by, etc.--is far more important in C&C than in MM'44 or BC, where rushing a single unit forward to attack is frequently a viable strategy.

Downsides:
The unit-type symbol on the blocks is small, especially the difference between green circle and green circle-white circle can be difficult to differentiate at a distance.

The playing aid tables for unit types are great. The last-page Close Combat table is worthless and should've been replaced, in my opinion, with a detailed Sequence of Play for Ranged Fire and for Close Combat.

To help learn the game, I suggest playing a game or two without terrain, elephants, and by first removing all of the special-case cards. In latter games, you can then add these back in, one at a time.

Summary:
This game is fun, relatively quick, and has enough luck that you can play people who are less skilled than you and still make a game of it.

Снова Борг... Да! Но эта игра не даёт мне ощущения дежавю. Всё те же сценарии, командные карты, отряды, цвета, но - античные тактики удачно ложатся на механику. Это не точечные маневренные уколы Мемуаров, здесь лидеры и построения определяют исход битвы. Интересно, несложно, но достаточно глубоко. За возможность поьбывать в шкуре героев античности игруля получает от меня очередной "мой выбор" для игры вдвоем. Оформление спорно. Во-первых часа 4 клеить на кубики обозначения войск, во-вторых очень специфическое оформление. Сначала необычно большие черные кубики, деревянные бруски войск, лаконичный дизайн карт, пустынная гамма игрового поля кажутся серьёзным минусом, потом - просто особенностью, к которой привыкаешь. В итоге 4 за оформление, 5+ игре.

RATING: 10
Very cool ancient warfare game.  I like how you roll different numbers of dice for the strength of units and how fluid the battlefield is.  I think it does a great job of simulating the chaos of the battlefield and much of the fun is trying to make the most of your hand.  I really enjoy all of the little wooden blocks; it gives the sense of two armies at battle.  This could move up to 9 or 9.5 with a couple more plays, as I easily was willing to play another round.

UPDATE: Another game moves into my set of pure 10s.  When you can play the game over and over again for an entire evening and you drop over $100 to get all the expansions and don't regret a penny of it, you know it's a 10.

It's odd... the game is a good one, but it doesn't fit the time period for me.  Fog of War?  Weird... Unlimited battle-backs?  Weird... I don't know -- just didn't really do it for me thematically, though it was fun enough.  Worth a few more tries, at least.

I'm not a war gamer but I really like how this one works.  The rules are relatively light (a few extras added to the Memoir '44 rules) but they manage to give you the feeling of having some control over strategy rather than just rolling with the card draws.  I think the blocks work great for this game, depicting several types and sizes of units--I wouldn't trade them for miniatures.

Fantastic game system! Ancients has never been more fun! Rules are simple without being overly simplistic. When you get them down (after a fairly short period of time, I'll wager), you'll be able to play multiple games in an evening easily. Scenarios cover much ground (over 200 official and not-so-official battles available) and are more than satisfying from an historical perspective as well. Games are a snap to set up, play, and tinker with, if that's your desire. Components are excellent and support is incredible. I'll play this one as long as I game. Definitely one of my top three games.

Have 2nd Edition Deck and cards are sleeved.

I really enjoy this game. That said, I find the "this is the greatest Ancient game ever devised" crowd to be a little off-putting. Mr. Borg did a beautiful job with it, and he's a genuinely nice guy, no mistake - but I'd rather play a game with him than plant a big wet sloppy kiss on him (and I suspect he feels the same way.) Some people are a little too enthusiastic in the wargaming side of the hobby when it comes to hero worship.

I think the low-level interactions of the units are great.

The best of the C&C series. Don't be like me and avoid it for years because the rulebook makes it look SO complicated. DON'T YOU BELIEVE IT! This game is basically the same, simple game you know from Battle Cry and Memoir 44. But instead of providing you with the basic game and then sticking the particulars of the units in an index, the rules cram everything in a WALL-OF-TEXT approach that looks intimidating and scary.

Do yourself a favor and gloss over the particulars of each unit when reading the rules. Then print out the cards provided by BGG users that provide that information.

RATING: 7
Memoir '44 was one of the first games I picked up.  It didn't take long for me to start to dislike the game because I want more control of my army (I did not care for the hand management aspect of the game).  

The main issue for me was the left, center, right sections of the map combined with the cards you need to move your army.  I would look at the board and create my plan.  Then I would look at my hand and see that I couldn't do what I wanted to do and had to adjust.  Sure I could look at my cards first and make a plan, but I prefer a game system where the cards help me to carry out my plan.

Based on reviews that I read CC:A does not seem as limited in this way.  My wife did not like the charts and my son did not like the theme.  While I thought the theme of this game was a better fit with the left, right, center the issue was still there for me and when combined with my families issues with the game it ended up being traded too.  

I found the system I like in Battles of Westeros....if I could only get to play it more often.

It's a good light wargame, very simple core rules. You get a big epic feel that isn't in skirmish-scale games (like Heroscape or Summoner Wars). The tactical feel is also great - you can feel that the heavy infantry is really slow, and that the ranged attacks are weak and plinky. 

On the other hand the learning curve is pretty steep, mostly because there's about a dozen unit types (on each side) and you have to keep flipping back and forth through the reference sheet for their stats. Also the rules for elephants are all over the place, it's crazy. Overall, it's not bad but I feel that there are better places to get what I want out of a tactical/minis game.

In this game, the C&C system models the warfare of the period much better than in Memoir 44.

RATING: 9
Brilliant, simple and historically faithful card-driven wargame from the 'Battle Cry' system. 'C&C:A' is the finest example of this type of game, where units roll a certain number of dice depending on their strength and have to roll symbols matching the units they are attacking in order to hit them. The use of blocks for units seems to fit very well with the ancient warfare theme and the tactical aspect to the decisions you make seem to be in keeping with tactics from that period in time. This is an extremely playable wargame which really should have a wide appeal.

This game is fantastic.
Believe the hype.

Once you are through the rules a lot of patterns on how different units work emerges and once you start playing, it all makes a lot of sense, even though it seems like a lot to take in at first.

You can utilize so many interesting tactics, you can get so much better at damage control and proper setups that I think it might be one of the best wargames I've come across.
It doesn't take forever to play, the rules makes a lot of sense, the game is tense and entertaining and it's fun even when you're not good at it.

This game is probably the biggest surprise of my wargaming experience. All initial signs pointed to this game being a big yawn; a two-sided block game (no fog of war), an ancient theme (didn't everybody just run into each other and stab??), and an oversimplified Borg system. It turns out I was wrong, in a BIG way. Commands and Colors Ancients is a wonderful game. Yes, there is a lot of abstraction, but it more than makes up for it with the tension it provides. This is a simple beauty. Whenever my little brother comes down from Logan, we'll most likely play it.

The cards do seem to be a bit more thought out than in Memoir and so there seemed fewer instances of having no cards to play.

It adds enough wrinkles too arguably make it worth owning both. This certainly has a far lower 'toy' factor about it.

I liked Memoir '44 a lot until I played this game.   Memoir doesn't really do justice to the time period it's trying to simulate.  C&C ancients feels like an ancients battle when I play it.  Memoir feels like a game about a WWII battle.  More diverse unit types makes this game more desirable to me.

A fun game, with some feeling of heavier wargames simplified and put onto a board.  I am not a fan of the stickers on wood tiles, it is very dry and, while I did not need to paste them on (I played someone else's copy), I understand it is not a fun endeavor.  For me this game is docked at least a point or so for the dryer components, but even so, it is solid with decent balanced mechanics, I like it.

As long as you don't come to C&C Ancients expecting much by way of simulation or historicity, then, if you're like me, you'll find the series a pure joy to play.  Tactically speaking, it offers more depth and subtlety to explore than you might expect, and this is particularly impressive given it's high fun:time ratio.  I hope that this wonderful little series will be developed for a long time to come.

RATING: 6
For my general opinion on this 'series' of games by Richard Borg, see my comments on "Battle Cry".

C&C Ancients seems to have some of the more interesting scenarios in this series, but also the thinnest production values.  In contrast to Battle Cry and Memoir '44, there are some wildly powerful cards in the deck.  The scenarios also seem to be more strongly balanced in favour of one of the sides (in comparison to the offerings in the other games), thus necessitating playing them twice (and switching sides) at a sitting.

Update: On reflection, I was probably too hard on these games with my initial ratings, so I've upped them a bit.  Even my initial rating and comments weren't meant to indicate that I didn't like them or wouldn't play them - I do enjoy them, and will happily play them from time to time - but none of them really grab me.

This game continues to grow on me. While the card-driven limit on moves is frustrating, and tends to result in lopsided skirmishes fought in one area of the board at a time, I appreciate the unit variety and ancient tactics. The game manages to feel dynamic even without terrain. If I want something meatier than Memoir, C&C is what I request.

I started with BL, got M44 after that and now C&C:A.

I still like every of these three games (I have some problems with BL currently, but I'm pretty sure that some these flaws will get fixed by FFG).

But I have to say, the people at the geek are right, C&C:A is clearly the best of the three games.

I hope that GMT expands the CC:A line to some other sceanrios (japanese setting for example ?)


But one question at GMT, why the heck did you put half a tree in the box but just some crappy plastic dice ?

My favorite of Richard Borg's card-driven tactical games. CC:A has tight gameplay that encourages smart formations and perfectly-timed attacks, is extremely well-balanced,  and has lots of great historical scenarios that range in complexity.

Still haven't played a complete game. There are so many unintuitive, fiddly rules that we have aborted every game we've tried to play. Also, the units all look very similar and each have their own set of rules for each situation, which makes for having to constantly reference the rulebook. Memoir '44 is just much more elegant and fun.

Update: Got Battlelore Second Edition and that seems to be a much better game, being basically everything I wanted C&C Ancients to be: Memoir '44 but with a little more depth. Battlelore simplifies some of the things that made C&C so frustrating, the units are very easy to tell apart, and it's just more fun.

Sold.

I am amazed at the elegance of this game and how the rules (which at first read appear to be rather simple and abstract) simulate the ebb and flow of combat in a very organic manner. Very impressive. Initial rating of 9.

10 plays: have played the first 10 scenarios in the base game using my solitaire rules posted here (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/6050679). Great game. Rating stays at 9.
20 plays: have played all of the scenarios in the base game and the Truceless War bonus pack. Have now purchased the first expansion. Unfortunately the second and third expansions are out of print at this time. Stays at 9.
30 plays: am working my way through the first expansion and have managed to acquire copies of the out-of-print second and third expansions. Still enjoying this game and looking forward to working my way through the scenarios. Stays at 9.
40 plays: almost finished the first expansion - one more scenario to go. Stays at 9.
50 plays: after somewhat of a hiatus I am now playing my way through the second expansion and remembering what a great game this is. Stays at 9, but I can see it going to 10.

A rating of 7 is that default rating given to games I like but don't love (like most everyone else). The problem is I should love it and I do as a solo venture. But my 3 plays with a live opponent were less fun. I don't know why. I do think that I am not thinking strategically enough. I tend to prefer tactical games and playing with my gut. The luck aspects (dice and cards) fooled me into thinking that playing this way was appropriate. But that not only keeps one from playing well (duh), it probably keeps one from immersing themselves in the game. 

I will continue to give this one repeated chances as I am sure it is one I will love.

Simply amazing. I really enjoy the card-based commands system and think it actually emulates (notice I didn't say "simulates") many of the command and control problems of ancient combat quite well with a minimum of overhead. The haters can hate, but until I get enough free time to try and sit down to try and learn Great Battles of History, this is satisfying my need for an ancients tactical game.

By the way, I would much, much rather play with wooden components than gaudy plastic minis that look like I'm 10 years old again playing with toy soldiers. Just my preference, and I'll admit it's a matter of taste, but I think GMT gets it. That said, I also much prefer wooden blocks over cheap-looking, dry, cardboard counters that make me feel like an old curmudgeon trying to pass the time before the next Civil War reenactment.

It's also turning me into a completist! Though, I wish they wouldn't make a new army set for every nationality... just more blocks to buy, sticker, and store. I guess they look a bit nicer and more varied when on the board, but it's gotten a bit expensive and storing them all plus setup (not to mention stickering) has been and continues to be a challenge. Given enough time, I'll someday do the whole Plano box system using the nice Geek File images to label where all the pieces go, but right now just finding the time to learn and play things is a challenge.

I've already made a P500 order for Napoleonics and can't wait to get that!

This is the first wargame that I've played since delving into the boardgaming world.  As a card-driven war game that resolves battles with dice, I'm sure there are plenty of purists that don't even consider this a wargame.  As a newbie to the genre, I like it's ease of play, the relatively short length of games, and the interactive gameplay.  The wooden blocks and color player aids are top-notch, but the board seems chincy when coming from a eurogame background.  I suppose I just need to invest in some plexiglass, right?

First Impression:

Amazing wargame. The Command & Colors system finally shows its potential. Contrary to its' poor brothers (battle lore 1st ed. and memoir) this game has tough decisions, variable units that make both sense and an impact in actual gameplay and some amazing concepts around leaders and unit types that are implemented in the card management. Here every decision matters, positioning and manoeuvering are of utter importance and luck plays the role it should (randomizing the results it should - not deciding games). The standard advantages of the system also come in play (great flow of play + variable commander capabilities).

Excellent game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A good solid, albeit light, game.  I must confess that I generally prefer wargames with a strategic scale to those (like C&C) that are operational in scope.  But this game is simple and straightforward enough that I find it a fun, quick play -- without much (or at least minimizing) the fiddliness (facing, line of sight, etc) that usually gets in the way of my enjoying tactical games.  Yes, the card system sacrifices some realism for game play, but I think of C&C as a game and not an attempt at a full simulation.  So, in summary, this isn't necessarily the type of game that I like, but I do like this particular incarnation of the type.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Not a bad light, card driven tactical war game. The draw of the cards seems a little too random to form any water tight strategy, but I guess that is part of the appeal. Learning to set yourself up to cope with a less than optimal card draw is part of your overall tactics. My first game took an hour and I was smashed by the Romans 5-2. It didn't grab me and make me say 'WOW!', but I would be willing to give C&C:A another go.

One criticism : I'm not completely convinced by the historicity of the scenarios (Numidian Light Cavalry seems underpowered in Ticinus and the Carthaginian setup for Bagradas is weird from a historical point of view)

What an awesome game.  The best beginner's war game there is.

It's a block game, but not for the fog-of-war effect.  The command & color system works perfectly with this theme of Ancient Warfare and the blocks do a great job of visually representing the lines of battle.

Its more of a gamers game than Memoir '44.  While this increases the depth/replayability/realisticness.  It increases set up time, referencing, and loses the cool plastic minis.  I will take Memoir everytime over this because of it.  This game is just too much of a tweener for me.  Too light to be a "serious" game, and too heavy to be a "fun" game.  I can see its appeal, it just doesn't hit home for me.

At some point you can take a good thing and put too many bells and whistles on it.  C&C Ancients is almost too many.   It's a great game no doubt about it but if I really wanted some of these features seems like there are other games that could be played to achieve them.  The beauty of the C&C system to me has always been the way it was perfected in M'44.  I can take that game and sit it down in front of just about any non-gamer and make a gamer out of them...this does not work that well so while a lot of die hard gamers may like this one better I like it less...it's not bad mind you I just called it a great game and for many it is and will be.  For me I'm going to play M'44.

I'm conflicted about this game.  Things counting against it are three-fold.  First, the components leave a lot to be desired (especially the board) which is a quick turn-off.  Second, the setup time is ridiculously long considering the length of the game.  Third, dice just bother me, especially when they have a large impact on the results.  However, it's a well-designed game that is pretty fun to play.  I don't think I need to own a copy, but I wouldn't mind playing someone else's. I would get one of the four different games with the C&C system, but I can't pick which one, so I'm stuck with none for now since indecision wins the day.

RATING: 10
The best expression to date (May,07) of the Richard Borg C&C system. It captures what I understand the flow and feel of ancient battles would have been like, for a commander, suprisingly well.

The Cards support the linear tactics and the back and forth jostling of a battleline.

I am one of the block lovers as well, they give a great look and feel for the linear tactics of the period. They are also easier to move around the board than a clump of miniatures.

Yes I actually gave a wargame a 10. Been feeling generous with these lately. But the ease of play and the fact that i don't want to bludgeon my oponent with a table leg afterwards makes this fun. It plays in under an hour so no more having to grit my teeth and deal with the anal probe that is known as Axis and Allies anymore.

Been through the first three scenarios with a friend and still enjoy it - I'm not sure what has me so involved in the game since you can win or lose based on a die roll and in some of the scenarios one side is a bit 'better' then the other - 

Command cards are good and varied and the special ones were interesting

I think it's really great because you can sit back and BS, have a drink, and enjoy the game while still getting the feel of a small battle occurring in front of you 

I think that I like this a lot more than others in the series such as battlelore - which, for some reason, I didn't enjoy very much - maybe that one tries to be too complex for what it is or maybe I just haven't played with the right people

Don't get me wrong, I like luck in my games. But I like luck when it helps swing the balance and add unpredictability within opponents of the same skill level. When luck makes possible for the lesser player to beat the more skilled one. That's where I draw the line. That's why I sold all these crap games like c&c and Memoir.

I like this game a lot and so does my wife. We're thinking of making our own copy of it, though. We kind of want to do it with minis instead of blocks (yeah, we like toys), and have the unit strength represented with magnetic disks under the minis instead of multiple minis per unit so we can move units easier and fit it on a smaller board.

Though a GREAT implemenation and abstraction of command, the implementation of troops does not have the excitement I would like

We have several copies of this at my local club. It's the go to game when we have a spare hour to fill or, if 8 players are 'hovering' with a desire to play one of the Richard Borg family of Command & Colours games. The 8 player Epic game is well worth the cost of two basic games, and often 'compete' for table time with the WWII equivalent from the same 'family of games - Memoir44 Overlord.

Simple but rewarding tactical wargame. Solid use of the gaming pieces allows fog of war and engine is quite smooth and intuitive. For anyone enjoying an easy enough but well formed tactical skirmish in ancient style. This truly is a tactical wargame, not your standard euro or ameritrash.

RATING: 8
Two player wargame in the "Commands & Colors" series themed around ancient battles (Romans vs. Carthaginians). A combination of card driven mechanics for issuing unit orders and specialized dice to resolve combat are used. Works well despite random elements - demands that players adapt strategies to their cards and use rules to increase odds in their favor to maximize dice roll success. Plays in 1 hour per battle but a proper match will see 2 games being played back-to-back with players switching sides and the winner declared from the total score of the two games. Upgraded my copy with the C&C:A dice from Valley Games, the mounted board from the 2nd expansion, some card holders.

I'm a fan. C&C:A is my third-favorite game (after "Glory to Rome" and "Prophecy"), and something I'll always play. It's fast, it's furious, and it provides lovely lessons in the need to keep one's line together, protect one's flank, use cavalry to harass the enemy's flank and cut off retreats--along with lots of gloating and groaning over dice rolls and unexpected results. A definite winner!

Also a definite Memoir-'44-killer.  Now that I have C&C:A, I don't imagine Memoir will be hitting the table very often.

I was hot for this game when it first came out.  The past year has seen very little play of it from me.  It seems that the Heavy Infantry all too rarely get a play, while the light infantry and auxiliary are nearly always 'out in front' and retreat after a few tosses of rocks, then retreat.  Also, the 'single units' left from the orniginal four, seem to 'run away' to the safety of the 'back line'.  It can be fun, but not one to want to get out again, and again.

RATING: 7
The Commands & Colors games are always enjoyable. This one's components are bland compared to the others (Battle Lore, Memoir '44 and Battle Cry!). In fact, since the look is so blank, I'm perfectly happy playing at Wargameroom rather than pulling out the physical copy. A number of mechanics give it a different feel from the others that captures the Ancients setting.

This game has some interesting additions to the Battle Cry mechanism.  Unfortunately, all these additions make for a very fiddly game. It takes an extraordinary amount of time to set up and you spend a lot of the game trying to figure out which troops are which and looking up what their capabilities are.  I stilled enjoyed the game but I really don't like to play games that take up more time to setup and put away than to play.

Suffers from "Okay, but I'd rather play X" syndrome.  I don't like this as much as its prettier and lighter older brother, [gameid=10630].  There's a lot more unit-specific rules to remember, and the cards are more restrictive, to the point which it no longer feels intuitive.  The graphics are absolutely awful, and the components are mediocre.  I don't get very drawn into the theme, as there isn't that much to make this seem like ancient warfare.  Command and Colors is a neat system, but for a game of its depth and luck, I want something that's easier to teach and faster to pick up.

(after 2 plays of first scenario)   Took a few rounds of combat to really "get it" in terms of the range vs. close combat, evade, leaders, etc.   But once you "get it" and understand the intricacy of the red/blue/green symbols this game shines and you won't be looking up evrything.  It is a step up or two in complexity from Memoir '44, but well worth it for the extra strategy it will provide in future scenarios.  I can see how Battlelore evolved from this.

First play 7/9/08 - My favorite of the 3 C&C games I've played. More strategy than BL or M44 and I like the stickered blocks better than the unpainted minis. It's been on my wish list forever and I finally got a chance to play it. I was given the favored Cartaginians against the doomed Romans and along with some spectacular cards and dice rolling on my part it was a massacre (6-0). I look forward to more games of this and picking up new strategies. Just the option of retreating pre-battle gives this game a whole new level of gameplay.

Не знаю что я наконец выберу: BoW или CC:A. Может и ничего. Я не уверен что мне понравиться.

---

Выбрал ССА :)

---

Сыграно 3 партии, наклеены почти все наклейки :) Что я могу сказать про игру. Она играбельна, быстра и интересна. Насколько - пока говорить рано. Но вот что хотелось бы отметить:

1. Я не совсем понимаю зачем было на кубиках делать 3 хита разного цвета. Это осложнило все таблицы, объяснения и броски. Хватило бы одного хита и двух промахов, вместо 3 разных цветов (где хит зависит от цвета юнита, а два других получаются промахами). Ну есть может быть парочка командных карт, где используются цвета, но это того не стоит. Возможно изначально в механике от этого зависело больше, а в итоговом варианте цвета роль потеряли, но остались на кубиках.

2. В игре много рандома. Я не считаю что это плохо. Но особенно важно отметить, что ССА являются именно игрой, а не реконструкцией. Это важно понимать. Чтобы потом не удивляться, почему в реальной истории в такой-то битве был удар правым флангом, а вам вообще тупо не пришла ни одна такая карта.

3. Как бы ни были хороши битвы, без уровня стратегии они будут что-то терять. Например так вам не важно с какими потерями разбить врага. Например в игре "Ганнибал: Рим против Карфагена" огромную роль играет с какими потерями битва закончилась, а не только кто победил (победа может ничего и не дать, или даже быть слишком дорогой). Частично проблема решается более сложными сценариями, но сценарии тоже не безупречны.

4. Не слушайте, что это легкий семейный варгейм. Да, он легкий, но только в сравнении с другими варгеймами. Типичная семейная игра на порядок проще, особенно на этапе входа в игру.

Played once, thought it was okay but not really my cup of tea. The thematic appeal of controlling an army and moving units across a battlefield is one I will indulge when the abstract mechanics behind the theme are worthy in and of themselves. Perhaps they are in this game, but nothing grabbed me in particular. The rules are not at all overly complex as I had been led to believe by reading some comments and reviews here on BGG; I guess Memoir'44 is just THAT much more simple, in which case I figure it's a game I'd like even less. It's too bad: after so much hype surrounding the commands and colors system (also employed in Battlelore) it didn't impress me at all...

RATING: N/A
"Commands & Colors: Ancients depicts warfare from the Dawn of Military History (3000 BC) to the opening of the Middle Ages (400 AD). Quite an ambitious undertaking for one game, yet Commands & Colors by design is a unique historical game system which allows players to effectively portray stylized battles from this time in history. The 15 battles, showcased in the scenario booklet, although stylized, focus on important terrain features and the historical deployment of forces in scale with the game system. The battles include Bagradas, Cannae, and Zama." This is a beautiful game!

Exceeded my (high) expectations.

Everything that is good about Memoir '44 plus more units, a more detailed rule-set, and a really nice production.  The ancient setting really meshes well with the system and battles are very tense as each side struggles to hold their battle line and keep the flanks from deteriorating.  

I only wish there were more scenarios included...

Alright. I'm officially addicted to this game. I love ancients but don't usually play ancients games due to the length of play. C&C plays quickly yet captures the feel of ancients very well. I think this is the best application of Borg's C&C system. It just goes so well with the ancient linear tactics. The card deck has been refined to reflect the tactics and the addition and application of leaders is very well handled. Awesome game... just can't get enough.

RATING: 7
I enjoy this game, but it has the following weaknesses:

1) The rules are too complicated for new players to get the hang of quickly, which is fine except that... 

2) Not being able to move units without playing the appropriate card makes the hand of cards drawn at the start of the game have too much effect on the battle's outcome.  

3) I have trouble relating to the Rome vs. Carthage battles.  World War II or Civil War battles have more appeal to me.

Support and battle back are nice additions, and leadership is paramount.  But I'll just never love the core C&C system, with the goofy loss tracking (you have blocks; why not steal a page from Columbia and rotate them?), the very high level of randomness, and the fairly shallow tactics. I also wish there were even more unit types (certainly enough blocks for this, if you don't use the stupid multi-block system), and more hooks for them to have special abilities.  And while I'm complaining, how about smaller hexes and more sense of maneuver?

I like the card dilemmas and managing around that, though, and the randomness can produce dramatic moments.  Also, the theme here is a better fit than in the others (Memoir feels particularly odd on this score; I haven't played BattleLore and don't intend to).

Borg's 2nd best use for the Battle Cry system yet (now that I give BattleLore top honors).  The blocks are functional though I would have preferred the plastic minis in line with the other games (BC and M44) that use this system.  Not revolutionary or evolutionary in nature but just a good, fun game.

Initial rating.  Pretty good, and fun for the time it consumes.  The different units are modeled decently and act in a historical manner for the most part.  The gamey weak unit hunting aspect of Mem 44 is here was well, unfortunately.  Good light wargame that seems to play in 30-40 minutes.  Dice are lame, but work well enough.  Blocks and graphics are very good.

A solid addition to the C&C line of games. More rich than Memoir '44 or Battle Cry, less confusing than BattleLore -- I'd say it's the best so far. BUT the scenarii are "historically" horribly unbalanced. You need to play more than one game to get revenge. :)

EDIT: I've been playing tons of Ancients with my girlfriend (who knew she had the heart of a wargamer?) and we've found that we didn't really like to play scenarii back and forth--we prefer to forge ahead into History. So what we do to mitigate the frustration factor is that whoever got beat up in the previous game gets to play the side that's "supposed" to win in the next game. This tends to cancel out the historical disadvantages and makes the game less frustrating because we essentially take turns playing the underdog.

Long the lines of memoir'44 and battle cry, but more complex. More battles can easily be created, by a little historical look up and cross checking numbers. They did only start with Rome, vs carthage, but there will probably be an expansion. I would almost bet on it. Look at sword of rome...

While I will admit the game is far better than Battle Cry or Memoir, I find that in spite of the fact that I keep my troops together in formation, as I'm supposed to, my son, who just charges at me with his blocks, always seems to win.

Due to the unit variety and support/line rules, C&C:A is the most detailed and conceptually interesting of Borg's card-based wargames (Battle Cry, M44, C&C:A), but it's still not overwhelmingly good or something that I would actually seek out to play.

The best of M44, BattleLore, and this.  The theme seems to fit the mechanics very well.  BattleLore seems a bit overdone in comparison. Blocks work well for units although its a bit hard for me (after only a few plays) to tell various units apart.

Update (12/31/2011):  After 10 plays, I can now tell the units apart easily.  The symbols in the upper left, which initially seemed hard to interpret, become very clear after a few plays.

Nothing like making a line of 12 hexes / 48 blocks / 20-30,000 men and playing a line advance card to move them all 1 hex forward and make an attack.  

Great period tactics like this yet playable in 1 or 2 hours is hard to beat.

RATING: N/A
On my first ever play, I was sure I'd got something wrong - the game just went too smoothly and quickly! But, no, it really is that easy to learn & play. Gave me the taste for this sort of simple wargame.

A superb game with all the chrome & complexities of unit interactions hidden away within the rules, instead of left for the player to deal with, leaving a very smooth, quick playing game with good historical results. 

Looks beautiful too. A carefully laid out CC:A scenario has become my Zen Garden of Contemplation... Actually playing it becomes an extra treat.

RATING: 7.5
This game has not worn out it's welcome with me. I need to see after more than 25 games if I find the amount of randomness causes it to lose it's luster. The battles are interesting, and I like the components, although putting all those stickers on the blocks does take time. After I read the rules it was fairly easy to explain them to my teenage sons. Setup and tear down takes some time but the games play quickly. My current feeling is the randomness of the card draw can be effectively balanced by keeping your troops in good locations, keeping coherent groups, and saving some good cards until later in the game. I have the board under plexiglass which helps to keep it flat.

I've never played Battle Cry or Memoir '44, but this game has impressed me. It plays really fast, and it is easy to explain, even to people who have not played any wargame at all.

Tactical level battle simulation using a mix of cards to drive commands and dice to resolve battle. Complex enough to be interesting but not burdensome for a fairly quick (1-3 hours) game. I like the random element in the game that can cause a good strategy to fail or turn a suicide assault into a game winning offensive. I feel it mimics the reality of fog of war and the unexpected that occur in real battles. The blocks are pleasantly tactile. Rolling dice to resolve battles is eminently satisfying as well.

Best of Borg's designs so far... Good idea to provide mounted boards. Now, if we could only get rid of those blocks! Campaign Book ala Memoir, please?

I substituted blocks with 1/72 scale plastic miniatures, and so far happy with them. I used a simple conversion system where all light cavalry/infantry/auxiliaries have javelins, all mediums have swords, and all heavies have spears - easy to tell them apart at a glance. Romans are gray (Zvezda), Carthaginians are olive (Zvezda/HAT), Persians are red/brown (Zvezda/Caesar) and Greeks are gray or pink (Caesar/Zvezda/HAT). Miniatures look much better then the blocks, but it takes longer to set them up and store them away, plus they take more space.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I like C&C:A. I really like the leadership influence in the command cards and "formations" and the support modifier to reduce the retreat flags during combat. There are a lot of units to wrap your head around, and I constantly had to refer to the player aids to figure out whether a unit could evade, advance after combat, etc. But I could see this becoming pretty familiar after a few plays. I'm not a big fan of the production quality, though -- the blocks are arduous to sticker, sort and store. The map is fairly flimsy and holds the creases so it won't lay flat easily, the card "planks" don't shuffle well and the dice are horrible. I'm a dice fanatic, so ridiculously awful dice like this literally drop my rating down a half point.

I prefer the other games in Borg's system.  I find the retreat rules for cavalry to be too deadly for the size of the board.  Because they are historical, the scenarios don't seem as balanced nor are they as interesting since most just take place in plains.  The units tend to just be the same with less variation than you see in other games like medieval BattleLore or Westeros.

After 2+ Plays: This is what Battle Cry should have been.  The battle back rules are the most important change.  Now, attacking a much stronger unit will actually hurt you.  After having tried all the C&C system games, I can say I definitely like this one the best.

After 5+ Plays: Rarely play this.  I enjoy it when I do, but not enough to ever request it.  Lowering rating from 8 to 7.

RATING: 7.5
This game is a great complement to my 2-player repertoire. It plays in under an hour, and the command cards make players plan ahead or work around an absence of orders for a column or unit type.

My only quibble with the design is that the combat feels a bit too random. The swords and helmets account for superior attack power, but the defenses feel very similar for all units. I won a game that I should have lost by taking 4 banners of a 5 banner objective in the final turn. That the luck factor can decide matches rather than just influence them makes C & C: A just a touch less enjoyable.

You have to understand: this is a game of Stellar Conflict. You pop cards onto the table as fast as you can - flying them around the table with your finger to get an angle against your opponent. Stellar Conflict! You need to say pew-pew when playing.  And in this space, it is one-of-a-kind-awesome. I really like it. I know my nephews will like it. Even my wife was surprised by it! It's super fast and light and zippy, zany fun.

RATING: 6.7
Stellar Conflict is a light, fast paced game where time is of the essence. There's an element of strategy and deck building, although it is not necessarily deep. Games with large decks tend to last too long; stick to the smaller variations.

RATING: 7
1st play: Better than I expected, very fast and fun little filler game.  The rules are pretty straightforward but the laser art could be a little more distinct for my tastes.  I'm happy to play it anytime we have 10 minutes to kill.

RATING: 6
A fun game kids would love, and works better than I thought it would, though a large playing surface helps. Basically you lay cards down with a timer limiting you, and then use rubber bands to trace lines of fire from your ships to enemy ships (or sometimes your own!), and see who ends up wreaking the most havoc on their opponent.

This one didn't grab me, but I would play it if pushed. It's definitely a filler, and can be a lot of fun if played with the right attitude.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Definitely best for us with just two players. It's very lighthearted in nature with lots of "pew pew" and explosion sound effects, but it's also just a little too fussy for a higher rating. Familiarity might make that better, but even after 8 sporadic plays, I still feel the need to review the rules carefully before playing.

Silly and fun.  The game is a bit fiddly as you have to create your decks to meet a certain point value, but it is fun to throw the cards down and then see everything blow up.  I find going through the resolution can be a bit long and there is often complaints that cards shift as we measure shots.  Still it is quick and certainly unique and intuitive.

Man, James Ernest is a genius. He makes games that, in theory, should not be fun, and makes them so damn fun. This games takes 1 minute to play, and ages to score, but it feels exciting all the way through the scoring. And laser-bands...awesome!

RATING: 7
Rating highly tentative - is this an improvement on Light Speed, or a step backwards? "Larger ships" certainly makes aiming easier, but also requires more table space. "Special powers" seems fun on paper, but makes parsing board-state harder. "Merchant ships" is more thematic, but it seems like parking them as inaccessibly as possible is optimal. Using a timer rather than "end when the first person runs out their deck" is absolutely a plus in my book, though I think I'd prefer to play with 1 minute for a 10-coin match (rather than 30 seconds). But variable decks / repeated ships makes scoring large games much more irritating; you no longer have exactly one (1,2,3,4,5,etc) per player, so have to scan the huge fracas over + over and hope you didn't miss something. And damage tokens look nice, but stand out less than, eg, glass beads.

As with Light Speed, playing on a tablecloth is vastly better than on a smooth surface, so cards don't slide around so much.

I really enjoyed my couple of games of Stellar Conflict and will be purchasing it to add to my fillers.  It was novel and fun but the long time required to score (it took us about 15-20 minutes each time but I guess could possibly be reduced to 10 minutes by experienced players) and the general chaos leads me to think it is one I won't be playing too often.

A filler whose attraction is the playing out of chaos. You have 30 seconds to place your spaceship cards on the table facing any directions you wish. Then you go through each level of spaceship card and resolve their facing (ie., do they shoot, get shot, both?) and see who ends up with the most still alive at the end. 

As fillers go, it's not bad if this type of chaos is your thing. For me, I'd rather play one of the Lost Legacy games.

Juego súper rápido de mecánica alocada y original en tiempo real. Ideal para echar unas risas si no fuera porque el recuento de puntos con tanto láser de acá para allá, acaba siendo un rollo, más largo que la partida en sí y no tan divertido. Aunque no es malo, no dan unas ganas locas de volver a jugarlo. Estrategias y decisiones limitadas por la "velocidad de la luz".

Very Fast little game thats heaps of fun, the actual turn takes 30 seconds all simultaneously and you just put your cards down on the table before the 30 seconds runs out then you go through initiative order of each different ship shooting into other ships via line of site from elastic bands, whoever kills the most wins pretty much.

In this game, which reimplements the James Ernest and Tom Jolly design Light Speed, players take over the role of an alien race taking part on a space battle. Each player has his/her own fleet and based on the size of the battle, he/she chooses which ships will be deployed for combat (deployment phase). Each race has its own power and abilities which grants it different advantages in combat.

After both players have deployed their forces in this time-limited real-time phase, the combat phase begins.

The Combat Phase lasts a random number of Rounds based on which ships have been deployed on the battlefield. Each Round, different ships fire their weapons and perform their abilities trying to destroy enemy ships and/or complete objectives.

Stellar Conflict offers a more advanced, deeper alternative to Light Speed. Each race has its own fleet of different ships and abilities guaranteed to offer lots of replayability.

RATING: 7.2
Great light game to start the night off. Surprising depth of play and strategy for just 30 seconds of frantic placement.

Scoring doesn't take as long as some comments complained - maybe 5-10 minutes, and is quite fun to see how the chaos played out.

Would love to see an expansion for this, and perhaps an alternative mode with slower or turn-based play. (then it would basically be neuroshima hex...)

I was mixed on the Cheapass version of this game and remain so. There is a mad scramble to place all the ships in the amount of time provided and then a much longer time spent resolving the conflicts for points. The production values are nice. The game barely fits inside the box!

Well, it is what it is: short, simple and asplody. Lots of asplody. And pew pew pew!

Pick your fleet, plop them in a crazy ass pattern while weaving and dodging around the table as your opponents do the same. Then use the little stretchies to figure out how many ships you blew up (including, most likely, at least one of your own.)

Its main virtue is that it is fast. And you can't go wrong with pew pew pew!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Stellar Conflict is an excelent game, especially for 2 players.

Pros:
• Game variety - Players choose from among 4 different races and build a fleet from a wider range of ships, which brings variety into the game. (Once I've played like 6 games in a row and the 6th game was as much fun as the first one.)

• Playing time - In my experience, building a fleet and deployment do not take more than 5 minutes. With a resolution phase in a smaller game taking no more than 5 minutes as well, you are still under 15 minutes, which is pretty good. (How many games you can name that beat this?) Also, after playing a 15-minutes game, you do not cry so much if you lose. ;)

• Materialistic side - The game is pretty cheap and doesn't take too much of your precious storage space, which are good things both.

Cons:
• Some people say that the deployment phase in Stellar Conflict is too short to make any tactical decisions at all. Well, nobody said you cannot double your deployment time. For me, this was a perfect solution to implement more decisions into the game while keeping its fast pace.

• Rubber bands - They are definitely a good and fun addition to the game, but sometimes it is not clear if a ship on a longer distance hits its target or not (especially while hitting/missing the corner of a card).

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Verdict: If you like fast-paced games and sci-fi theme and if you'd like to play some real-time duels under 15 minutes each, and if you have like 15 bucks to spend, don't go to Burger King. Get this instead. ;)

Video Review - https://youtu.be/OzCVNeXyEs0

Stellar Conflict is a short game with real time rounds that involves you building then deploying your fleet in 30-90 seconds. You then grab your elastic bands, check for the lowest initiative and score away. 

Each of your ships is a card displaying a space ship firing lasers in various directions, depending on your race you may have special lasers too. Once a card is placed it cannot be moved, so the game plays out like a highly streamlined and quick miniatures game with no movement.

Scoring takes at least as long as playing as you work out, with the help of chits, if you have done enough damage to destroy any ships (including your own (not advisable)) which then go in your scoring pile. 

It all works well and can be played over and over.

My two criticisms are the box is far to small - although that is being remedied by new publisher Stronghold Games. And secondly there are quite a few numbers and information on the cards giving them a confused look.

Definitely give this one a try if you like real time elements.

I enjoyed the game where it was quick, a little strategic with assembling your fleet and quickly getting them out onto the table.  

It can be a little fiddly with the interactions of ships and which ones fire and using string to see which ships are hit.  Hard to keep track of everyone's special powers.

I personally feel like this game can be awesome with the right group of people.  But at the moment my group wasn't a big fan of it the first (and so far only) time we've played.  But that was mostly because they placed down cards randomly without thinking.

So this has potential to go higher, but as of now it's a 7

Update: Game group finally learned the mechanics to this game and it's now probably our favorite filler game.  But this game is going to remain a 7.  At the end of the day it's fun but there isn't that much depth, and unless if you are crazy good at analyzing what other players are doing at a VERY fast pace it's all fairly random.

Compared to the original Lightspeed, this version is slightly less elegant, slightly more replay value, much nicer art.  I'm a fan.

I strongly suspect that the faction with the special utility ion cannons is just weaker than the others -- a puzzle-y utility power in a real time game is almost certainly weaker that more direct offense based powers.  But I'm still happy to play them.

I usually don't like real time games all that much, but Stellar Conflict makes it work. It's not possible to be strategic here, so just do the best you can in the brief time you're given, and watch the carnage unfold as you discover you accidentally blew up half of your own ships. 

Also, it's very short and very easy to learn, so it's a good choice of low-concentration filler.

Very quick, but it begs to be played in more of a campaign mode. Like, take the surviving ships, get so many points to repair and reinforce your fleet as you choose (perhaps weighted to favor the underdog), go again. Repeat for X rounds and/or Y points. Fortunately, this enhancement would be completely cost-free, so if you want a quick, fun, real-time game, this is a great option.

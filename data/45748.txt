The Wheel definitely adds to the experience (especially with new players). Benefits from speedy play. House rules: 2-tile cities are 2 points; roads are worth as much as city tiles

2010-04-14 (rating 8.5):

Since I have this I no longer play with [gameid=822]. Using Wheel of Fortune gives more fun.

I myself rarely put followers on the Wheel. But I do like the events and preparing for them. Especially Pest which if happens while you are unprepared would be very costly.


I don't like how the Wheel is done. It is a single piece so it is easier in keeping and set-up than it was with Count. But this makes it fit less with other tiles. I would prefer the Wheel to be done from separate tiles just like Count was.

Also it would be nice if the Wheel was done so that at least on one edge it would match Count exactly. It is possible to connect those two but not fully.


But in the end this does not differ that much from the base version anyway. So the rate is only a little higher.


Currently I am thinking about making more numbered tiles so that in plays with numerous expansions the Wheel will still turn as often.

In variant I am currently testing (drawing 3 tiles selecting one and discarding the rest back to the pool) the Wheel is even more interesting as now you have some choice how it will turn.

Just buy regular Carcassonne. This can also work as expansion but is really better as a stand alone.

Interesting variant of the original. If you don't have Carcassone then this would be a good starting point.  If you do it really doesn't add enough to warrant another box on the shelf.

RATING: 9
Use mainly as expansion tiles, yet to use the wheel. The new breakdown of the 72 tiles is better than original. Hybrid between Orig and Inns&Cathedrals 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a modified base set plus a small expansion.

The modified base set is awesome, because the selection of tiles is way better than in the original.

Forget about the expansion, it's horrible, it just adds some randomness, but you could just ignore it and to not play with it.

RATING: 6
Wheel mechanic sounds interesting at times but just can't bring myself to chew up such a massive space on the table with the wheel board since the game already consumes a lot of real estate.

Maybe if it is a small box expansion without all the original tiles and the box.  You know, something small and cheap, but if it is only in the base game included version when RGG releases it, I will pass.

RATING: 6
This makes for quite a different experience as you add in a whole other mini-game of gambling and risk-taking.  It is an interesting little addition.  I would probably rate it higher if it was integrated better with the regular game, but I guess that was kind of the point.

Don't buy vanilla Carcassonne.This is a MUST version if you like Carcassonne.I disagree with most people that say it adds luck to the game.I say it adds more options,therefore more strategy,especially with the possibility of returning one meeple of your choice from the board.

An interesting twist on an already solid game. This one adds the Wheel of Fortune and it does feel like an expansion on what you are doing, rather than just unnecessary complication.

If you love Carcassonne, this could bring some refreshing changes to it for you. Otherwise, it's just nice to play.

Car. WOF is more family game where the luck and the strategy both involved. the WOF allow more planning when placing meeples, but more randomness. However, there is always an option to ignore the WOF and just play the regular Car.

Random movement of the Wheel can both help and hurt depending on location of the meeples. It may rescue them from an uncompletable feature or cause the loss of an unreclaimable feature, or just give you bonus victory points.

Another NEW Carcassonne-game. I don't think that it's as good as the original version. It's too much luck.
The only space on the WOF that really makes any big difference is the PLAGUE and I hate that one. You play with too little meeples to have any to take back. All the other steps usually don't give anybody more than 3-4 points more than the other players.
But the game also works as an expansion. I haven't tried that yet...

A good alternative to the base game.  The Wheel does add a little chaos to the game, but its not bad.  The jockeying for the crown spaces can be fun.

Because of the wheel of fortune, this base game variant is slightly more balanced than the original game.

RATING: 3
First play tonight - 5 players. I did not use the WOF at all and won by over 30 points. Alessa came second and also did not use the WOF. 
IMHO the WOF just adds more luck to the game.  If the others playing tonight had used their meeples to build rather than on the WOF I think the result would have been quite different. Overall I would have to rate this expansion very low as it really does not add anything to the game other than increasing the luck factor.

Pensaba que era difícil mejorar Carcassonne pero al contrario de lo que mucha gente piensa está versión/expansión le da más posibilidades al juego. Cosas como no perder un turno usando tu meeple para la rueda, recuperar meeples atascados e incluso sacar algún punto adicional a granjeros, caballeros y monjes pone sobre la mesa un abanico de nuevas posibilidades. Una sorpresa en todo regla, pensaba que iba a ser un ni fu ni fa pero me ha gustado.

RATING: 3
A hideously overpriced expansion as you not only get the expansion, but the entire base game to boot. Granted, the colour scheme is better: more natural, less cartoony. But other than that there is no compelling reason why this expansion couldn't have been made as a standalone thing. Probably to gauge sales for future releases: in terms of releasing quality game products and giving a customer his money's worth, this box scores very, very low.

Does the Wheel expansion add anything to the base game? A little. But not enough to warrant the high price it commands, unless you happen not to own the base game yet. But even then you should think twice about getting it: the colour scheme is not compatible with previous releases... If it weren't for the fact that my partner won this game in a lottery, I would be more than happy to have left this turkey on the shelves of my local toy store.

I thought this would be lame, but it's not so bad.  It's basically like playing the "Fat Albert" rat game at a carnival:  You can put your meeples on the titular "wheel of fortune" instead of placing them on a tile, and then when someone draws a tile with a wheel icon, you move the pig around the wheel -- where it stops, if you have a meeple there, you get the reward.

A bit abstract, but like I said, it's kind of fun anyway.

Rated is as if it were a Carcassonne expansion, this isn't one of the better additions. We spent more time working out what happened each time it triggered than we ever spent thinking about how to use it strategically. Just adds a lot of luck to a game that didn't really need more luck. I have this as part of the big box so am keeping it but don't expect to play it very often.

I really enjoyed playing this Carc spin-off/expansion as a stand-alone game... the wheel actually offers some interesting extra choices & not as much random silliness as you'd think. (It is not a roulette wheel but a rondel - that's gamerspeak for "it's actually a cool gaming mechanic, guys.")

A very unpredictable expansion where you have to try to balance the possibility of taking a more valuable spot on the wheel with the possibility of taking a spot that seems more likely to actually produce points. It also simultaneously adds a sort of random event feel to the game, which is definitely a different flavor for carcassonne.

RATING: 7
Not yet played as an expansion (it would make the game enormous), just as a stand-alone when we want a short game, very close to the basic Carcassonne without expansions. 

The only new feature is the wheel of fortune; it is not a huge improvement, but is quite ok: a little luck element, and some extra choices (‘should I put a meeple on the wheel?’, ‘should I keep some at home or put one extra on the board in case this or that event comes up?’), that do not affect the game tremendously, but can sometimes make a difference.

RATING: 7
Bought this as part of a three game "late" Christmas gift for myself (with Container and Zombies 8). Gonna love the extra 72 tiles to make my games of Carcassonne even longer. And unlike the Tower expansion, I can see myself trying out the wheel portion at least occasionally.

Rating is based on one play with 5 players. With that number  the play is a bit chaotic as it is not easy to finish scoring opportunities and so a big chunk of the score comes from the wheel. Nonetheless I am giving it a 7 since I can see playing this both as a standalone in the future, as well as mixing it in with the regular Carc, to add more play time and a bit extra chaos here and there.

In Carcassonne Bin. We play this BIG. I have 2 base games and every expansion I could get my hands on. Even sent away to Germany for a Spielbox Magazine with the Plague expansion. WE LOVE THIS GAME!! We move furniture and play on the floor. We play all of it at the same time. ALL OF IT. We have a knapsack that we toss all the tiles into. We sprawl the map all over the place. Full games can take hours and scoring the farms at the end is a total headache but we LOVE THIS GAME!! We don't bother separating the expansions afterwards because we know we are going to play the whole thing the next time anyway.

First played December 30th, 2009. Taught in 10 min (for those who are familiar with the game and rules) and played in an hour with 5 players. There is a good luck/strategy mix in this variant. This is much like the base game except: 1) two tile cities are worth 4 pts; 2) farmers are worth 3 pts; 3) some tiles have a wheele icon on them and you move the wheel around 6 spots depending on the number 1-3 on the tile and perform the action 4) after you place a tile you can elect to place your meeple on the wheel in one of the 6 spots (three have spots for two meeples) and they are worth 3 or 6 (for the three with two spots) Victory Pts. I'd recommend this to those Carcassonne enthusist, however you may want to steer clear if you've had your fill of Carcassonne.

Azt kell mondjam, megfűszerezte a játékot. A körcikkek többsége plusz pontokat ad, és attól függően, hogy mennyire kockáztatunk (lekötjük-e valamelyik alattvalónkat egy-egy ilyen mezőn), még többet lépegethetünk előre a pontozótáblán, ha bejönnek a számításaink. Ugyanakkor a pestisnél pl. vissza kell vennünk egy bábunkat a játéktérről, ami igazán izgalmassá tehet egy-két szituációt. Nekem ugyanis nagyon ritkán van lent olyan alattvalóm, amiről úgy érzem, hogy könnyen feláldozható, és ilyen esetben nehéz dönteni, hogy a majdnem körbezárt kolostorról vegyem fel a szerzetesemet, vagy egy olyan munkásomat távolítsam el, amivel jó eséllyel a játék végén több pontot szerezhetek, mint a szerzetessel.

This may come close to but not quite breaks my view that all you need for Carcassonne is the base game, Traders and Builders, and Inns and Cathedrals.

It adds a new way to score some points and throws in some surprises as the wheel turns.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
pretty much the base game with a few added components from other expansions. Adds a degree of luck and therefore requires better strategy which in turn makes for a game where adults have a better edge over kids. Which altogether can make for a less enjoyable family gaming experience or one where people are wildly diverging in terms of experience.

That being said, it's a nice once in a while version to play (considering the wheel), but definitely not one worth buying considering that we have a few of the expansions.

Not a bad game but does make you wonder when the Carcassonne Gravy Train will end.

Plays much like standard Carc, except players now have an option to add a meeple to the Wheel of Fortune instead of a placed tile for the turn.

Certain Wheel Tiles then trigger a pig that moves around the wheel and where it lands will trigger a scoring option for the whole table based on where they have meeple allocated.

I don't think this warrants too much consideration for big fans of the original game but it is a little more interesting for those that do not own a Carc title and on those grounds I would recommend Wheel of Fortune over the original game (expansions excluded).

If you still play a lot of the original Carcassonne, you might want to consider picking this up. It adds a way to score potential points if you draw a useless tile, it will allow you to remove a meeple from a dead position, and though we only played it once, I think the center board will break up the farms enough to make them more interesting.

I prefer to play The Castle, The City, or Discovery when I need my Carcassonne fix these days, but if we can ever pick this up cheaply, I wouldn't give up the chance.

RATING: N/A
A wonderful expansion or stand alone carc game. The wheel adds just the right amount of fun and strategy. I really like how the wheel is part of the game itself, with tiles building off from the wheel tile, (similar to the count). Too good! It adds more potential scoring possibilites by placing your meeple on the wheel!

Good variant that involves placing followers on a wheel of fortune instead of the board to score bonus points. Not overly keen on the wheel of fortune being the four by four start tile as I like building from a single tile as it is more strategic and competitive. Possibly I could put the wheel aside and use another start tile as a home rule. Slightly, bemused by the giant pink pig.

Small problem with scaling with other expansions as the the triple points from the crown spaces become insignificant in high scoring games.

Surprised this was issued as a base game rather than an expansion with just the Wheel Of Fortune, the pig and the tiles with the icons needed to rotate the pig.

I quite enjoyed this, adding a sense of fun and whimsiness to an older game. A bunch of tiles in the game have pre-printed numbers (1-3) on them which, when picked up and before they're played, advance the little piggy around the rondel triggering a little scoring for everyone depending on the space the piggy moves to (eg 1 pt per guy in a city, or farmer, or cloister, etc). One space forces you to remove a guy. You also have the choice now, instead of placing a meeple on the board, of placing it on a rondel space which will score 3 pts if and when the little piggy lands there. It's hard not to play a tile that will eventually score more than 3 points, but especially in the early game playing to the rondel seems a decent option until the higher scoring opportunities develop. All the same Carcassonne decisions are there - when to play meeples and when to conserve, when to farm, etc - and the tile deck seems much the same as the original. But the rondel provides a touch more choice and a touch more luck at the same time, providing a more festive atmosphere that might be attractive for families in particular

Interesting one this, obviously it's more Carcassonne at heart and your appetitie for this will depend on that for the base game. However the wheel comes into play for scoring a lot more than I expected and provides a viable choice. The wheel segments also all trigger and even the Plague, while initially seeming a negative can be used to extract a Meeple from a trapped or unpromising place.
Overall I'd say scoring is up across the game.

Originally I intended to throw it into the main set, but I feel this would greatly dilute the wheel tiles (frequency) and the game certainly stands on its own, so I think I'll leave it as is.
I expected it to be just the tiles from the basic start set but there's some pleasing additions in terms of city ends.
A welcome addition to the Carcassonne family

This version of Carcassonne creates a gambling element to the game that's a lot of fun.  You can place your meeple on the Wheel of Fortune and hope to score 3 or 6 points when the pig lands on your spot.  But it can be risky, because the pig may not land on your spot for a long time, or at all.  And then the different action spots can impact how you play the game, because you may claim a certain feature because you're hoping to gain some extra in-game scoring from the Wheel of Fortune.  And the giant start tile is a fun way to start the game.  Another great Carcassonne  stand-alone game!

Exactly like the normal game, but with a wheel of special actions in the center of the board. You can earn points through the various actions, or by placing your meeples on the edge of the wheel which score points also.

This is pretty much identical to Carcassonne, except it adds an extra layer of complete randomness with the wheel mechanic.  Basically you're playing vanilla Carcassonne, but every once in a while (there's zero control as to when), a player or players will get some points or lose a meeple.  As someone who thought Carcassonne was too random already, this game did not impress me.

I'm rating Carcassonne more than the specific wheel of fortune expansion. This is an easy game to learn and teach with a huge replayability factor. Set up/tear down time is minimal, there is a depth to strategy that is not apparent in the first handful of times playing it. There is also a big element of luck, which makes the game exciting. It is easy to play the original version until you get the hang of the game, then add in the wheel of fortune feature which adds more chance.

RATING: N/A
An unlikely title but a decent game. A simple tweak to base Carcassonne which makes it more family friendly. The start tile is now HUGE (which makes it easy to find) and has the eponymous wheel on it. The wheel lets players gamble when they have no good meeple placement. As well as gambling for points, there are events, some of which such as "return a meeple to your stock" significantly alter game play. Nice fun, the tile mix was good, and the increased dash of luck adds some drama.

RATING: 7
A variant base set, with some tiles of the original replaced by tiles from expansions, with the [i]wheel of fortune[/i] as an added (but essentially optional) expansion.

If you like Carcassonne, you'll certainly like this version too. Especially since you can play without the wheel and get a slightly different base set (which keeps experienced players on their toes, since the tile mix is different from the one they're used to).

The wheel adds a push-your-luck element, in that you can now place a meeple on the wheel itselef, and get points when it turns to that space. This lets you do something with a meeple on those turns where you might not be able to place one on the board otherwise. The random points (for unfinished cities, for meeples still in your supply, etc.) granted by the wheel are a nice feature when playing with beginners, as it keeps the scores more equal  in my opinion (as it's very hard to play into the different conditions on the wheel).

Eh. The biggest benefit is that it changes the normal nature of which things you might want to do, such as having more people not doing something or in your supply. But it is ruined slightly by randomly skipping sections on the wheel, which simply means some people will benefit from luck instead of from planning.

This is a decent take on Carc.  The Wheel is a bit silly, but you don't have to use it to play.

A base Carcassonne with 12 tiles from other expansion instead of basic ones, the pink pig and wheel of fortune. The wheel itself is interesting from time to time, but is too distracting IMO. If you want a second set of Carcassonne, this can be a good choice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
A stand-alone set of Carcassonne with an alternate starting tile and a few optional rules. At the very least, it's more tiles that (could) help fill in some common holes in maps. Whether that's needed or not is up to debate. I'll have to get this game first though.

RATING: 7
I like the tiles more without the numbers. So I would like to play with this tiles only with this expansion.

Another version of the base game, but I like it. You could a meeple instead of a tile like usual, on a crown tile on the wheel of fortune. You will propably score points, but you don1t know when and you don`t know for sure, that you`ll get the points. The more meeple you play on the crown fields, the fewer you have for the standard game. So you have to make decisions. 

Exept the points, there also events, that will come into play. Aditional points you have also in another expansions. But here you can get point`s for the meeples in your suply. And sometimes you`re forced to remove one meeple from one tile.

Quite a nice game of Carcassonne.  Because it doesnt have all of the extra tiles that my base set does (due to misc configurations from expansions), it made for a great 2 player game.  Not too long.  The wheel added some randomness, but not so much that it decided the game.  It was still very close.  Nice.

I love this version just as much as the base game. I really like the random events of the wheel and the additional points scoring mechanic. The randomness makes this game much more fun to play among my family members, but more hard core gamers might prefer the original game due to a lower luck factor.

I gave this one a (6) because it the only description that is the closet to my reasoning.  We received this game for Christmas one year and played it a couple of times.  It adds to the original but we have stopped playing it and condensed our "wheel of fortune" game into the original box.  We have taken out the meeples and colored two sets of meeples to accommodate for a seven player game.

If you've never played Carcassonne, this could be a decent substitute for the original.  I do like the fact that you now have the additional choice of placing a meeple on the wheel if the tile draw doesn't give you the potential to score many points.  However, I really don't care for all of the interrupted scoring.  Seems to add a lot of down time and randomness.  On the one hand the monastery is a bit better; on the other, the farmer seems to be too powerful.  To be honest, I'm not impressed.

Everybody who knows how to play the basic Carcassonne game, can start to play this game in less then five minutes after explaining the new rules. The wheel of fortune tile (which has the size of 16 ordinary tiles), is the new starting tile. The wooden pig that comes with the game is placed on the wheel. The wheel results in more luck dependence in the game. Is this bad? Not really, as Carcassonne is a great gateway game for new players, and with this addition it will stay a great gateway game. When a player draws a tile that has one wheel (or two, or three) on it, the wooden pig will move that many spaces on the wheel. The action on which the pig ends become available to the players, and they might score additional points. As said, it’s a nice addition, and it provides some fun, but we would prefer the base game above this one.

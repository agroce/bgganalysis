I liked it.  Nice and simple to learn, but lots of hidden depth, plus risk/gambling!

Update: played twice now and really like it

Five plays in and still like it. Also found it a great gateway game for new gamers.

Light worker placement with card set collection.

This 2-4 player game is about collecting resources in order to acquire buildings (which are points), and cards (which are minimal immediate benefits and potentially large endgame points), while maintaining a steady food supply in order to feed your meeples (people).

The game mechanic is the tried (tired?) and true worker placement, and the options are: 1) resources, of which there several- wood, clay, stone, and gold- in that order of value and difficulty to obtain, 2) food, which is needed to feed your workers each and every round, 3) farms, which provide a guaranteed food income each round, 4) tools, which increase the probability of your obtaining resources/food, 5) buildings, which can be built for points using specified resources, 6) "loveshack", which produces an extra worker, 7) cards, which again require resources, and which give small immediate benefits, but are really collected for endgame considerations- there are several different types of point modifiers based on number of endgame buildings, workers, etc., as well as set collection of different culture cards.

In order to obtain resources, the new (old) in vogue dice-rolling mechanic is used- roll a dice for each worker placed in an area and count the number of dice pips.  Divide this number by the appropriate factor (ie: 2 for food, 3 for wood, 4 for clay, etc, rounding down), and that's how many resources you obtain.  You can modify the results with tools, with the tool value being added to the number of dice pips.  Obviously, this can result in some spectacularly good or bad results on any given roll- in some ways this is thematic, but...

Turn order rotates each round, and as with all placement games, it's always better to go first rather than last. You need to feed your people each round (1 food per person) or you lose 10 points per round- although this is apparently a viable strategy to ignore feeding and take the 10 point hit.  The game ends when you run out of cards or a stack of buildings is depleted.  The components are great, and the game seems to scale well (well not really, it plays quite well as a 2-player, 3-player is OK, and 4-player has all of the issues outlined below in abundance, and is no longer playable as such IMO).

Now my issues with the game: 1) it is FAR TOO LONG for what it is, and 2) turn order is a bit too significant a factor- there is no turn-order change placement like in Caylus, Age of Empires III, and Pillars of the Earth.  Basically if you randomly start the game as 4th player, good luck to you, and oh by the way, if you're not a lucky dice roller, good night!  If this game played in 45 minutes it would be a pretty decent albeit light game.  If there hadn't been about 10 games of this nature released before it, it might be a really good game.  As it is, it's a very derivative, lengthy luckfest.  That said, the theme and ease of gameplay MIGHT still get it to the table occasionally, but again the length is the biggest issue.  If I want to play a light worker placement game, I'll go Pillars of the Earth everytime, hands down.

Edit: OK, well now I've played this about 230 times on BSW (I only play 2-player), and with about a 70% win percentage and nothing close to lucky rolls (I suck at rolling, even computer generated rolls!), I have to admit there's a pretty good amount of strategy hidden in this game, for 2-players at least.  I'd probably rate this about a 8 for 2-players.

A pretty low score after only one play, but maybe because of the players, the game took a lot of time, which made it a little tedious and boring. If you remove the theme, this is just a worker placement game that feels much like work, all you do is accounting. If the huts would give you special abilities to use, or something like that, it would be much more interesting to me, but this is just pure "place worker, get resources, trade resources in, gain victory points" gameplay where nothing exciting happens until the game is over.

IPAD Version in Mexico. HARRY Great worker placement game that plays in under an hour (with two) with many interesting choices and strategies. Less aggressive than Agricola and not so harsh at feeding time. Components are top notch and the game board is decent looking. The girl soundly beat me on her first attempt when I was "teaching" her how to play. :-( My excuse is that it was my second game.......... Er.......

Very attractive for these two groups - lots going on with everyone involved and they love the dice rolling. It's also great that it isn't always clear who is winning. A good addition to the collection and recommended.

Pretty dull worker-placement fare, with limited thematic integration. The pictures are all very nice, but ultimately you are swapping resources for un-named cards without really telling any form of story: there is no progression. This is where Agricola excels over superficial games like this one (and others in the genre). The dice-rolling makes the game frustrating at times and adds little. The game works and is not unenjoyable, but it's a tired genre and this is not the most exciting example.

LIKE: Excellent gateway game. Tiny bit of engine building with a lot of push-your-luck mechanisms and dice rolling. I like the arc of the game from getting resources to scoring points on the cards. Many ways to mitigate the dice rolls.
DISLIKE: Randomness in the dice. A little on the lighter side of the weight spectrum.

OVERALL: Good to great game, depending on the level the players are at.

After a few more plays, my rating is dropping a bit. I feel I've seen the paths through this game and I'm slowly losing interest. Also, it drags on a bit long - depending on the players of course. Still, it remains enjoyable because it's so much fun - worker placement and rolling dice in an extremely nice production.

RATING: 7.73
A great introductory worker placement game.  Not as "pure" as others due to resource collection being governed by dice rolls, but have only played a couple of games where the probabilities swung wildly in favor of or against a player so the random element here isn't necessarily a killer.

A large percentage of the game's points are determined in the end-game scoring, thus it can be difficult to assess mid-game just how well one is playing relative to other players (absent paying very close attention to what special cards each opponent has purchased).

From the Reviews: This just did not capture me. I don't mind dice games but when the game relies so heavily on it I tend to shy away from that. Plus the theme seems not cool, but I am willing to try it with a fresh mind to see how it is

Although it's got dice and performance is directly attributable to pips rolled, given that a lot of dice are rolled over a game they tend to average out quite well giving rise to the better strategy. The underlying game is strong and works well with 2, 3 or 4 players.

Probably my most played worker placement game.  Caverna is better, but its so much more of an undertaking that Stone Age just hits the table more.  SA is just simple enough that you can play it with people that are intimidated by Rosenberg-level complexity, but it has enough depth that I don't feel I'm playing a watered-down worker placement game.  Love the way the dice mechanic allows for random "Woo!" and "Argh!" table moments but gives players lots of control over how big of risks they'd like to take.

Why it's previously-owned:
I really enjoy playing Stone Age, and was revitalized when playing it with its expansion.  
However, when playing with relatives, they also really seemed to latch onto this game and love it so I left this game with my relatives hoping to further their decent into true gaming madness.  We still have tons of other worker placement games to play so we don't miss this one too much.

RATING: 7
The word that comes to mind is elegant when I think about Stone Age. The gameplay is worker placement but everything just flows so well and fast. The theme is not total immersion but actions make sense and the amount of times the mating hut is referenced as a joke adds its own caveman references. The placing of workers once a round also adds the theme of the limited time each caveman had to do things. It also adds so much to the gameplay due to the limitation to maximise efficiency and importantly adds some player interaction. The rules are also easy to learn and plays in about an hour.

Downside is the dice rolls can be a problem for some if one has an issue with dice but that can be mitigated with tools in the game. 

In conclusion, definitely a modern game classic I will try to play more often.

Y'know what?  I like this game.  Yes, it's dicey and luck may equal win, but it's just fun!  I enjoy playing it and will rarely say no.  Plus the pieces and board are fantastic.  Rating raised from 7 to 8 (7/05/08).

EDIT (3/25/2016):  Rating lowered from 8 to 7.  Great game but the ios version, and me playing WAY too much of it, taught me that the strategies here are paper thin.  There's not much variation, despite the apparent randomness.  And while good/bad dice rolls can have a significant effect, there are ways (well, one easy way - tools) to mitigate them.  Overall, I've seen too much to really love this one again.  Still, it's a good, solid game, just not one I want to play very often any more.

:thumbsup: The challenge of managing an entire civilization is real, and nearly every part of gameplay feels brilliantly thematic.

[microbadge=30754][c] [/c]The steps taken at the end of each turn can be a little hard to keep track of, and may feel fiddly at times.
[microbadge=30754][c] [/c]The rules are rather in-depth and typically require extra time to look up definitions during play.

:thumbsdown: Certain moves and decisions feel somewhat scripted, since they typically always occur in certain situations.

It's an excelent game.
You have to combine getting victory point with raw materials, food, increase your people or harvest, tools, treasures and constructions in a complex strategic for winning

Try your movements being related among them or you won't get the victory. It's neccesary do not get raw material useless for the end of the game or movement with a small profit

Its rules are similar to Pillars and Alhambra but they are really original

GREAT!!!

This is very good. Seems like there are many possible strategies, and adapting your strategy to other players is the key to success. The dice rolling is a nice way to make the game a bit less heavy, but luckily the dice are rolled so often that the probabilities don't make good luck with dice the best winning strategy.

Really boring. 

It's an indication of how this site works that the dice in this game are considered important, or even relevant. All they do is add a tiny bit of randomness that seems pointless. 

This game is the beginner spreadsheet. It's as dry as they come and even has the ridiculous 'starvation' strategy. 

I'm close to calling this a 2.

[With the poorly named expansion]

Not sure why this is so strongly endorsed -- for two, at least, it seems somewhat scripted and automatic.  The engagement is low for the time required to play.  Basically, I grant there are a few plausible strategies, but they are sort of pre-scripted (for two, at least) and don't feel very _fun_ at all.  The board and stuff are beautiful, though.

Update:  Ok, over time it grows on ya.

:cry: :D :D :) Great light-medium worker placement. Enjoyable on its own merits; it would probably only be a 7.5, but gets bonus points because it is incredibly popular and is the #1 compromise game for people who like lighter games and people who want heavier ones. 

The only way this isn't fun is when not everyone understands how to fight a Starvation player. I played a tournament game once where the other players practically refused to take cards and drill huts, and mostly helplessly watched the guy win with like 250+ points.

Not a fan of worker placement anymore, but tried this one and enjoyed it with 2 and 3 players. It plays relatively fast (1.5 hours), which means you can play it twice vs. playing Agricola once. 2015 UPDATE: Since my sister and husband enjoy this, and it plays well enough, a keeper for now. Board is informative with useful icons indicating what is available and can be done.

I bought this game around Christmas to play with my family. I had heard that 'worker placement' was all the rage, but I had not had the chance to try the mechanic before this game. I knew about games such as Caylus and Agricola, but I wanted to baby step into those. This turned out to be a great option.

The use of dice is extremely clever in this game. It is very strategic and I cannot understand the comments stating that this game is too luck orientated. Risk management does come into play and you should know when it's safe to gamble and when it's not. Learning this is part of the experience.

Everyone I've taught this game to has enjoyed the experience. I don't expect that to change with age. The dice, huts, and cards should add enough variation to keep the game feeling fresh every time.

RATING: 6
It's a pretty bare-basics worker placement game. I might play again if I exhaust what I felt were slightly more fun (Castles of Burgundy) alternatives in my library. Essentially, it's the tried and true method of economic efficiency engines with extreme passive-aggressive spot-taking. That's by no means a negative at all and Stone Age does the genre proud by offering solid gameplay. The problem is that I cannot honestly rate this game high in replay value as Caverna and Feast for Odin do everything better.

A really great worker placement game with a good amount of randomness.  The dice mechanic is a lot of fun, but the real element of chance comes from the distribution of certain powerful specialists on the boats.  Players need to decide if they want to reach for those powerful boats at the cost of their other plans in a given turn, and there's a lot of challenge to getting the timing correct.  While it may feel too luck-based for some, I think this adds a lot to the game.

I've only played it with the fashion expansion. My sense is that I like all the things the expansions adds. The base game options alone seem 'good' to me, so I'm rating the game in that light. But if you have the expansion--I think it raises the game's bar to very good.

A nice entry level worker placement game. It has some luck that can be mitigated but the outcome between equal players might be decided from that luck element.

Meh.  Decent worker placement with some things here and there, some dice rolling, this that and the other.  It's easy to teach, but there are a pile of tiles and the goods are just numbers on the trade-in-for-points wheel.  Scoring is also really obtuse because it's just matching bonuses.  To be honest, if I want a light worker placement I prefer Waterdeep because it's got more player interaction and less of the fuss involved in dice rolling for resources.

2-4(4)

It's fine. Pretty accessible and the dice add some tension. The other mechanisms generally make the game interesting (tools, agriculture). Some parts feel mechanical (grabbing the special slots early).

I'm just not entirely convinced that there are multiple interesting victory paths. I mean, there are the huts and there are civ set cards and there are the civ multiplier cards.

The other issue is that it's pretty overbalanced. It's kind of annoying and pointless how mathematically balanced everything is. Wood = three pips and pretty much always converts to three points. Gold likewise with the number six. I mean, in Agricola at least you *feel* that wheat, veggies, sheep, pork, cattle, wood, reed, clay, and stone all have a different place in the game. In Stone Age all the resources will be variously randomly in demand or not depending on what hut (randomly) flips, and for the wild card huts it's just a straight conversion of pips spent into points. Bleh. The only distinction is one resource of any sort to feed (thus making food a good occasional play) and needing non-food resources to snag a Civ card (thus making wood more valuable). Otherwise, depending on the huts to flip, there's NO distinction between clay, stone, and gold. Overbalanced.

Likewise with the multipliers. Tools, farming, and extra people all give you extra actions and being able to cash in on these just depends on when and how the Civ cards come out.

I'm not as hot on this these days, but I'll play it. Others enjoy it fine and it looks gorgeous.

Quite a pleasant worker placement game in a similar vein to Pillars of the Earth.  Like Pillars, Stone Age has randomness, though it's in the form of buckets of dice, so you can play the averages and take calculated risks.  Like several other worker placement games, interaction is limited to occupying a spot before an opponent.

My impression is of less going on than in Pillars, so that play is fast and smooth, if a bit repetitive.  Strategically, the game gives you options without overwhelming them in a mass of detail. Given that repetition, game length is on the high side.  If it played in an hour, I might actually want to own a copy.

Stone Age is lightly thematic, though there is one jarring bum note. Early agriculture was hugely labour intensive compared to hunter-gathering and yet the great advantage of farming over hunting in Stone Age is that crops require no meeples to tend them.  

The artwork is quite pleasing and functional.  Production quality is high.

A nice, quick medium-light game, but, after many plays, I am growing more and more dissatisfied with it, just like I did with Settlers of Catan, and for the same reason (the roll of the dice determine too much of the outcome for my tastes).

UPDATE: I no longer feel that the dice play too much of a factor.  The beauty of Stone Age is the degree to which you can mitigate the luck involved with respect to the dice.  Build a huge population so you don't have to worry about crappy rolls, or invest in tools to accomplish the same effect.  This is actually one of my favorite two player games.

This game doesn't hit the table very often anymore as other euros have taken its place.  It still stands out as being unique in the way dice are rolled and the luck of said rolls needs to be thought out and mitigated through other actions in game.  What I dislike about Stone Age is the fact that certain worker placement spots are obviously better than others so that typically makes the first few workers placed each round predictable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.2
The resource collection mechanic is a little bland, based on the luck of the dice.  This is offset by the fact the player has to decide how many of his workers to allocate in order to maximize that collection.

The rest of the game works extremely well and has nice interaction, in that only one worker can be placed on a desired card, building or tool area.  

Increasing the size of your family requires two workers, so you've got to time that just right.

May 2011:  A very basic worker placement game, that feels a little weak for me.  Giving it a 7 of 10.  

March 2013:  It also feels very marginally thematic in the sense that the game is so very directly, and so obviously, about acquiring resources, following placement and dice rolls, to purchase huts and cards that truly have nothing to do with those resources in particular.  

Thus, this game is all basic and well-worn mechanics really, though the board and cards do seem to have nice cave-people graphics.  I just have no desire to play this game again, so I have to downgrade it to a 6.

A great combination of 'lite' worker placement. Accessible to somewhat green board gamers with the strong theme and attractive production values, yet offers enough strategy that gamers shouldn't be outright bored. Normally I don't rate games like this that highly, but I'm always heavily biased in favor of certain themes.

A nice, light-weight worker placement game that is easy to teach. I like this one a lot.  It helps that I get to make crude comments about the hut all game ;)

The release of this on iOS is a fantastic development.  Now I can play some quick games against the AI to work on a strategy or two for the game. So far, I haven't really won this one when it has come out.  Too much time focusing on everything except the end game.

Played this at the Foot Foot retreat and really liked it. Bought a copy and played it again with my home group and like it even more. I feel like the concept and the gameplay are both really solid. It's not too slow either, you usually don't have to wait too long for your turn due to the meeple-placing mechanic.

Good middleweight euro. Very nice components. I want to play this more. Theme is pasted on.

EDIT: After second game I had to drop the rating from 8->6. For some reason I just don't enjoy playing this very much. Maybe it's a bit repetative; you do the the same thing round after round and there's no feeling of accomplishment.

A relatively light-medium weight Euro game that I'm hoping I can introduce to my group that is more interested in theme games.  I like the worker placement aspect and the strategy in determining the best use for your limited actions each turn.  After playing Agricola I can say that I still love Stone Age for what it is, that being a fun strategy game that doesn't have the same brain-burning complexity as Agricola.  I love Stone Age for its simplicity and love Agricola for its complexity.  =)

My introduction to the worker placement genre.  And while my rating for this game has slipped, this is still a very fun game to play.  Allows for many tactical and strategic choices while still utilizing some luck in terms of dice/ pip production.

One of our favorite worker placement game. Thank you Sam Healey from the Dice Tower for talking so much about this one. Love the theme and the artwork (my dream game room will have Michael Menzel game boards framed and mounted on the walls [I might have mentioned that before] )but most of all the game play. The resource gathering using the dice can be a bit random but it's easy to offset. The one thing we don't like about it is how the scores can go into the 100s. It's  just silly really. Why do the scores need to go that high? Our last game ended with a score of 265 to 242. That's insane. But it is the only dent in this otherwise flawless game.

RATING: 6
No esta mal para pasar un rato pero no tiene mucha variedad en cuanto a las acciones posibles. Las partidas son todas bastante similares.

La cosa de tener que tirar los dados le da cierto toque aleatorio que le sienta muy bien. Al tirar los dados siempre tienes esa sensación de "a ver lo que me toca", "ojala salgan muchos 6s!!" que le da un encanto especial. 

pero...

Hay gente que detesta tirar los dados. Aquí lo haces siempre que deseas conseguir recursos y si no estás de suerte puedes recibir menos recursos de los esperados. Aunque el azar tiene mucho que ver en el juego existen tres formas de controlar tu producción:

La más obvia es empleando más trabajadores en la tarea para tirar más dados y tener más posibilidades de conseguir más recursos. A veces, si es vital conseguir un recurso concreto, no se debe escatimar trabajadores y "jugartela" hay que poner suficientes para asegurarse un mínimo aceptable.

Otra es fabricando y utilizando herramientas que modifican, a tu favor, las tiradas de dados de producción.

Finalmente siempre puedes ir a por las cartas que otorgan recursos directamente (sin  tirada) y encima proporcionan puntos de victoria.

Bastantes partidas no registradas.

Eurogame redondo de gestión de recursos ideal para jugar con no jugones ya que se explica en 7 minutos.

En su parte buena, es muy entretenido y variado gracias a cartas y tiles. Tiene mecánicas chulas y aunque jugar no es difícil, tiene la suficiente profundidad para rejugarlo con cierta frecuencia sin cansarte. Lo más positivo que puedo decir es que es muy redondo, nada sobra, nada falta y además las tiradas de dado le dan un punto muy divertido sin ser totalmente determinantes (se pueden mitigar con las herramientas).

En su parte mala, es un eurogame asequible con lo que eso implica. Si eres muy jugón, puede quedarse un poco corto para tí. Además, las mecánicas no son especialmente originales ni tampoco tiene tanto tema que te vayas a sentir un troglodita.

La expansión no la he probado, pero no la veo necesaria. Además creo que acabaría con el efecto de redondez que transmite el juego.

Un eurogame más, que a mi particularmente me gusta jugar.

Stone Age has a strong strategic worker placement element without the complexity that is Agricola.  The scoring system is based on several elements, and you are not able to do/buy everything you want to on a turn.  So you really have to balance your strategy and adapt to what others are doing.

The only stupid thing is that the box inserts and boards don't fit in the box.  This doesn't affect game play.

Somewhat underwhelmed after the first face to face play, but hitting it up on BSW really opened the game for me.  There is luck and it does seem like there should be some kind of turn order compensation, but overall I think it's a very solid Euro.  Placement, dice, dice control, collection, the ability to emphasize scoring paths, controllable game length, blocking, all kinds of stuff really.  I want to play this much more than Notre Dame, Caylus, etc.  Rather enjoyed the theme after thinking about it too.  Surprisingly good with 2P!  Perhaps best?

This is one of the few games that I can well and truly enjoy even when it's not going very well for me. There's just something about being able to blame the dice that takes the pressure off.

That said, while the dice are definitely very meaningful, it's very possible to play in a way where you're almost assured to get what you plan for and not feel like you're sacrificing actions to do it. I'd really like to play this game 4-player to get a feel for how much different it plays than in a 3-player game. I have the feeling the decision-making process is much more interesting.

RATING: 5
Do dice dance when you are near?  When you pick them up, do they quake in your hands at the awesomeness of your luck?  Can you close your eyes and have them land on the table with exactly the values you pictured?  If you answered yes to any of these - you should own 2 copies of this game and make your living gambling.  If you more normal with dice and you are tired of Yahtzee, then this might be worth picking up.  If dice skitter away at your mere presence or crack and crumble at your touch then you should avoid this like a plague.  This game is capable of single-handedly destroying the very basis of probability and will leave you a worthless shell of randomization.  Is it luck driven?  Maybe just a wee bit...

I played three games in a 24 hour period (with practically everyone new to the game) and enjoyed all three games. Different numbers involved change the dynamics of what can be taken by whom and each player, after working out the rules, seems to have a different idea as to best strategy.
So far this seems to be the single worker placement game that I'll actually go out of my way to play.

2008-12-05 Have been informed that there was a problem in the rules interpretation (my fault) and so I may have to change my rating of this after a couple of games with the correct rules. I don't think it will impact on my enjoyment significantly though.
2008-12-10 Having played with the right rules I'm not changing my rating down, it may go up.
2008-12-31 Up it seems, my third 9.
2009-12-01 After a year it's dropped back. Mainly as a result of excessive 2-player games.

I've only played one game of Stone Age, and I really want to like it!  However, throughout the entire time I felt like I was just cashing in things for victory points.  There was no sense of progression, as there is nothing to work toward besides getting resources and then spending them on cards or huts (the latter give you no special powers and give you the exact same amount of victory points as your resources are worth, with no regard for how difficult those resources were to procure).  

Sure, there was the occasional blocking maneuver thrown in, as in other worker placement games, but the lack of interaction and sense of repetition really drags Stone Age down.  

I would like to play again to see if I'm really missing something.

Lovely artwork, and the mechanics work very well, but they also feel rather abstract: You're gathering resources purely to score points (with each resource having a distinct scarcity level), not to actually use that type of resource for a specific purpose.

I've only played on-line, but I can attest it's a very fun game. Maybe a bit too long for what it is (and probably, if played face to face, can drag a bit longer), and it does have some concept flaws (such as the wood being the most sought-after resource, and the baby making the most sought-after hut), but the bottom line is it's a fun game.

UPDATE: It's just too dependant on luck, and it takes way too long for what it is. I might be convinced to play it, but I don't really want to. Down to a 4.

Absorbing fast paced game.  Dice rolling, but axe modifiers give you choice as to where to suffer - food or resources.  The green cards cannot be left to two players only as they multiply up too high for others to catch.  A close cousin of Pillars but lighter and more family friendly. Recommended.

One of the new classics of hobby games.  A solid worker placement game with some interesting dice mechanics, fun theme, and smelly dice cup.

Much more interesting than the popular (but ultimately shallow) Lords of Waterdeep, but not nearly as engaging as something like Caylus or Agricola, it sits firmly in the medium-weight euro category.

The only reason I don't own this is because I have Alien Frontiers which I feel scratches the same itch, but I will happily play Stone Age if it's suggested.

Absolutely gorgeous board and pieces.
The game play is very similar to most resource gathering, victory point purchasing games.  The twist is that you get a "random number" of resources when you collect them.

Unfortunately it is a raw random roll and it is entirely possible for you to come away empty handed.

I don't like that you can't really mitigate the luck.  It is possible to lose because of the roll of the dice without any mechanism to recover from it.  

I would like to see an expansion or variant that allows you to recover from really poor rolling.

I consider Stone Age more of a tactical drafting game than a worker placement game. The workers are your drafting currency while the civ cards, huts and raw goods are the resources you draft to convert to points. Each resource has differing levels of guaranteed and potential ROI and some resources simply require more currency than others. 

The civilization cards are what breathe life and longevity into the game as they are what make the resource valuations more challenging. In my first few games, I was concerned about the role of the dice. I'd say that the timing of availability and the tactical decisions surrounding the civ cards are much more significant than the dice rolls. As such, luck of the dice is no longer a concern. The part of the game I'm most leery about is the endgame where vindictive, non-optimal "blocking" can occur which ultimately can skew the final scores. At this point though after about 10 plays, the potential kingmaking plays tend to be minimized when playing with experienced players.

Nagyon szeretem a szaporodós helyet, szerintem ezen alapul a nyerő stratégia:) Jó kis játék, sok féle győzelmi lehetőséget kínál, és gyorsan megtanulható. Ja és szép is, a körítés is szimpatikus. Szívesen játszom vele.

Hibának érzem, hogy nem lehet minuszba menni a pontszámlálón. Így túl nagy előnyhöz jut az, aki az elején nem szerez pontot, csak szaporodik és nyersanyagot termel, hiszen nem kell etetnie...

Really nice game, very straightforward in terms of mechanics and ways to win, but rather difficult to make it there unscathed. Once you get into the rules, you are truly hooked and look forward to your next game to try and do things a bit differently or see if fortune smiles at you and you can time the steps of the same strategy better that before.Nice replayability.

First game.  The game has great production values.  The meeples are unique and the resources have unique shapes that tell you what they are.  The only thing I am disappointed with though is that there are only 10 gold pieces.  It is pretty lame that the publishers did not provide enough.  Overall it is a good gateway game.  It is a really simple game to play.  You start with 5 cavemen that can gather resources, tools, make babies and purchase cards.  When gathering resources each caveman designated to gather resources represents a dice.  So if you put 4 cavemen to get wood, you roll 4 dice.  The sum of the dice results divided by the value of the resources would equal to the number of the resource you receive.  There is set collection as well for points in form of cards and converting resources to points by building buildings.  I think the publisher should have provided 4 sets of dice so that during the activation phase, everyone can roll their own dice to gather the resources since nothing in this phase will change the outcome.  The meat and potatoes of the game is during the cavemen placement phase.  This is when you decide what your cavemen will be doing.  The game should play half of the time if people have their own set of dice to determine the amount of resources they will get.  Overall a good game.

A great intro worker placement game that can handle 'gamers' as well. This game scales surprising well.  Only knock is if you are going first, it is pretty predictable that you are taking one of two roles. That predictability aside, there are several paths to victory, though most involve some accumulation of cards.  No matter how much I stress this to first-time players, they ignore it (despite my goading them on during the game) and don't realize it until I start adding up my score.

A great light/medium game. It's the natural "next step" for newbies, after the holy trimurti (Catan, Carcassonne, Ticket to Ride): when you mix worker placement with some little luck (dice rolling), you get a game enjoyable by the casual gamer, but with enough depth to challenge experienced players. The awesome artwork by Michael Menzel is the wonderful ice-topping...

the buildings are really badly priced. the 'you choose what to pay' ones should give a LOT less points than the 'you need exactly these resources'. otherwise any illusions you could have had of your decisions having any impact on your score disappear... you simply need to be first when the best 'joker' buildings come up in the second half of the game...

Initial Impressions: I bought this game to introduce my wife to the "worker placement" concept. She took to it like a fish in water and began playing very aggressively during our first game together. It's worked as a great gateway game. 

10 Plays: This game continues to provide fun for the family and works brilliantly as a gateway worker placement  game. I've taught the kids now and they're enjoying the game. In particular, I enjoy the multiple paths to victory, as well as players' ability to control the pace of the game through the purchasing of hut tiles.

EDIT 8/12: After 13 plays, I feel like the game still holds up well. I'm not sure it as much of a gateway game as some say, but it definitely has some nice things going on it it, and offers a lot more strategy than Lords of Waterdeep.

EDIT 1/13: After 31 plays, this game is still a fun worker placement, but there are MANY euro games that are much better than this.

I only played this game once and I didn't enjoy it very much. After watching it on TableTop a few weeks ago I realized that it isn't quite as complex and I remembered and that I actually did enjoy the die rolling to determine resource gathering. I'd definitely want to play this again and may rate it higher once I do. 

Edit: Moved it up to a 7. I played with my brother and his friend and began to understand how it works a bit more. I still really appreciate the RNG of the worker placement for resources, but I do have a negative. Knowing which cards provide which multipliers at the end of the game is too predictable. Each time I've played, the person who goes hut heavy and gets the 3x hut multiplier blows the rest of the people out of the water. Additionally, the 'starvation' strategy should be punished more, so that if you starve once, it is -10, if you starve your people again is it -15 or -20, etc. The negative isn't bad enough to deter people from doing it. I still want to get it and play it, despite the nasty smelling cup.

This is a thematic and easy game to play with almost no aggression, which makes it a great family game. The only dangerous resource to lack is food, everything else is simply a race to collect and score VPs. I played one two player game and would like to try with 4P, but my initial impression is that it is an inferior game to other worker placement titles such as Cuba or Caylus, but superior for family friendliness.
Update: Played 3P and increased my rating. I would like to try playing with a block on the hunting grounds, that would add needed tension.

Stone Age is a lot of fun, and people that I introduce to it have all agreed. This was the first worker placement game that I had played, and it really opened my mind to the possibilities of gaming, probably more than any other game I've played has done. It was very unique to me. I think I prefer this one with 2 or 3 but would never turn down a game with 4. I also like the end game scoring where the current leader isn't always the winner. It adds a fun amount of post-game tension.

It's funny...upon playing a game that is so highly rated, enjoying the adventure, the dice cup feature, the myriad decisions to be made, and a beautiful board with great bits, I feel no compulsion to add this title to my collection.  Very odd, since all of the above have been individual reasons for me to purchase a game, and here they are all together. I don't know if it's because it feels like I'm playing Caylus and Pillars of the Earth at the same time, or if my opponents always seem to have a better grasp of strategies that work, I just don't feel the urge for it to take up shelf space...even stranger when you see some of the things that are already there collecting dust.  I'm usually willing to play if it's brought out, but I guess my feelings will just have to be unexplained for the time being.

[i]Posted: 3/17/09, Rated: 9[/i]

Despite its Cro-Magnon theme, [i]Stone Age[/i] is a perfect example of the modern-day Euro game.  All of the trappings are there: a richly-saturated board, individual player mats, wooden bits galore, tiles, cards, coins, and dice.  Wait, strike that last item.  Dice aren't very [i]chic[/i] in Euro games, but they are present in [i]Stone Age[/i], along with a natural leather dice cup.

All of these components (except the dice) are used in a very familiar fashion.  Like [i][thing=18602]Caylus[/thing][/i] and [i][thing=24480]The Pillars of the Earth[/thing][/i] before it, [i]Stone Age[/i] requires you to place workers to gather different resources.  These resources are then used to acquire victory points.  These mechanics should feel ancient by now, but [i]Stone Age[/i] manages to evolve towards simplicity.  There is no "ownership" of spaces like there is in [i][thing=18602]Caylus[/thing][/i]: you can place your workers in an open spot without agonizing about helping an opponent, too.  There is some contention for the best places (a fiddly rule that works), but overall the options are more balanced than the choices in [i][thing=24480]The Pillars of the Earth[/thing][/i].

There are a few different ways to score points.  The set-collection nature of the cards combined with the multiplying factor of upgrades requires forward planning, but so does resource collection when purchasing the different buildings.

Where do the dice come into play?  When collecting resources.  Here is the unique mechanic of [i]Stone Age[/i], which will be very catalytic.  Each worker figure placed at a specific resource location enables the owning player to roll one die.  The total number of "pips" rolled determines how many resources are collected.  It is possible to soften the blow of a bad roll by purchasing upgrades, but you can't completely mitigate the luck in this game.  Either you're okay with this quality, or you'll hate it.

In an ironical fashion, [i]Stone Age[/i] represents an evolution of the worker placement mechanic, even though its theme is from a more ancient time.

Stone Age is a solid game, a worker placement game where the actions and goals are easy to understand. It's not hard to be successful and earn some points, but skilled play gives big rewards.

It can be difficult to teach the scoring rules, as there are different elements that score immediately, score a certain value, score a variable value, multiply something else at the end of the game, or are multiplied by each other. Lords of Waterdeep has a more obvious do-quest-get-VP mechanic, and it's probably where I'd introduce people to worker placement.

Huge hit. This is the gateway game I start with for new players. Love the board, and I like getting into the theme (fellow players worry for me) - "YEAH!", I yelp, when slamming down my two meeples into the hut space, "Makin' Babies!". Always end up with a brood of 9 or 10 in my case. :)  Sure its got dice, but its FUN dice - and great for math with the kids! Like the variety of winning strategies.

It is definitely a gateway game for worker placement. However, I can't imagine playing this for long before moving on to something else. There just isn't enough variety of options to go for.

A bit of a miracle game this one. I hate most games with dice but somehow this one manages to overcome this genetic defect and evolve into a classic resource management game.

Build quality is very good with chunky tiles and excellent wooden tokens and meeple. Next the rules are very straight forward with sensible and highly effective variants to cope with 2&3 players as well as 4. The game can be explained and started in 10 minutes.

Most importantly there is significant player interaction. You have to keep an eye out for what the rest are up to and block them off when necessary. It seems there are several routes to victory so all in all it seems to lead the pack when compared to other games of this ilk (Pillars of the Earth etc).

And its on line at Yucata.com, who could ask for any more?

Well the 3expansion with the decorations actually. This expansion is such an improvements. I will only want to play with the expansion in future.

Some complain about the dice rolls but I do not think that takes away from the strategy at all, but rather it enhances it and makes for a more "realistic" aspect (everytime guys go digging for gold they do not return with the same amount every time).  The game forces you to balance your approach and no one plan wins everytime.  The art and components are AMAZING and all these years later my cup still smells real leathery!.  This is probably my favorite worker placement game.

Re-named "Smelly Ball Sack" due to the included overly pungent leather(?) dice cup, there's much to think about and lots of options to get you where you want to go. The dice add so much to what might otherwise be an average worker-placement game. Excellent game that my group revisits often. There have been far more many plays than have been registered here.

Very fun worker placement.  A beautiful game as well.  I appreciate a game with good components and this fits the bill.  I think the dice are integrated in a perfect way, each person you add to retrieve a resource is added probability of coming home with more loot.  Interesting that the majority of the scoring comes at the end with all of the bonus cards.

Not sure what it is about this game I don't like.  Maybe it's because I do so poorly everytime I play.

After 4 plays:  I think I've figured out why I don't care for this game (having finally won my first game).  In every game I've played, victory is decided by the cards.  Generally, 2/3 of your total points will come from cards.  Though there may be several "secondary" strategies (thus as starvation, tools, farms, etc.) the main goal is to get as many cards as you can.  Your "secondary" objective is dictated by the cards you've managed to gain.  I generally don't care for games that appear to only have one strategy to win.

This is a less intense "Pillars of the Earth". There are fewer options on where to place your pieces and it only plays up to 4.
That said it's an awesome game in it's own right. Each family member placement is a tough decision. Also, the fact that family member placement goes round the table rather than randomly pulled from a bag leaves less to chance.

It can drag, but when everyone knows what they're after, it can be one helluva game.  Learning it isn't hard.  Learning to be good at it takes a game or two.

I like the game, but I have to be ready to play to want to play this.

01-27-11:  Punched it to a 10 when I caught myself measuring pretty much every euro resource I've played against it.  In my opinion, this has it all when I want to explain what a good resource euro is.

The big thing in resource gathering games (not so much even worker placement as this one is), is you need to formulate a strategy and plan accordingly to this strategy.  

What's great about this, is that to anyone who has played just one of these types games before at any point in their life, you can see what someone is doing when they're doing it, and how much it's getting them, immediately---whereas in 90% of your resource euros, it's not readily obvious until 3-4 turns later when you're kicking yourself for letting the guy across the table corner the market on something.

As such, one can immediately react in basically whatever way he feels appropriate.  When he does, he's not limited by any strategy and path chosen initially.  All options are always on the table for everything at all times.  Whereas in most of your resource games, either changing-up a strategy or doing something offensive is a bit like doing a barrel roll with a B-52.  More often than not, for as bad as you want to do it, it's just not something that would be prudent given the immobility of the situation.

THEN, there's dice as that final element of, "Well, even the best laid plans of mice and men go awry."  Because quite a few of the more complex games, I feel add so many layers of complexity, it might as well be luck of the dice anyway.  This takes that, and makes no facade about what it is.

Overall, just the level of strategy, competition, simplicity, elegance, and emotional content of this game... this game is one for the (puts sunglasses on) ages.  (YEAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!)

The first time I played this at one of my gaming groups in late 2017, my instant feeling was "Where have you been all my life??" I love everything about this game, even if there was no such thing as gold mining in the Stone Age. It's the definitive worker placement game, and also great for those who enjoy natural resource management. There are many paths to victory, and it's fun trying out different strategies. It flows smoothly, and always provides a varied, engaging and enriching experience.

A classic worker placement title that is far easier than most of them out there.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
CONCEPT: a village of cavemen/cavewomen break off into smaller groups to create the best community. Best being determined by stone age advanced, most buildings, most people, most food production, etc. 

OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus (but only if you enjoy resource management games which are competitive but less so than wargames and the standard Axis & Allies board games) 

NUMBER OF PLAYERS: 2-4 

AGES: 10 and up, though, I think it's more like 12 and up. Seems complicated for 10 years olds. 

OVERALL SPREAD: every player starts with 5 pieces that represent a group of their people. Every phase of your turn you get to place some of those pieces into a certain category on the board. 

Those categories are typically: 

1. VILLAGE CENTER: put two pieces to create a baby at the end of the piece. You can also increase your food production or build tools that offset bad rolls. 

2. RESOURCES: you can go for more food by hunting or seek out quarries for wood, clay, stone or gold. Gold is the hardest to get per turn. You need a six on a regular die to get this so most players use multiple workers to have a shot at getting just one gold resource. 

3. BUILDING: there are four stacks of possible huts to build. What is required are a variation of resources. The better resources means more victory points. One thing about this stacks is that when one runs out the game is over. 

4. CARDS: there are four cards laid down. You have to put a worker down and also pay resources. These cards typically give you something or give you a chance of getting something. One of the big victory point conditions on these cards are artifacts which can really add up your total. In addition, there are special types of people, like shamans (who add bonuses to your total people at the end of the game), builders (for number of huts at the end of the game), farmers (adding totals to your food production at the end of the game) and workers (adding bonus totals to your total tool use point total). Like building cards, the game ends when there are no more cards to draw from the pile and there are less than four cards remaining. 

TACTICS: this is a game where blocking your opponents can really pay off. For instance, if someone is close to ending the game the other players can block a card he/she needs to play or they can sit on a resource that he/she cannot take. In fact, the rules actually suggest you do such things 
Heh. 

HOW DOES IT COMPARE TO AGRICOLA? For those who have played this game the answer is that STONE AGE is about half the time and a third to a quarter of the many resource pieces. 

Enjoy!!!!

I like my worker placement mixed with a little luck.  What can I say, I like dice.  I like when a roll hits just when you need it.  I also like trying to overcome the adversity of a string of bad roles.  I think it adds a lot to the excitement and tension in the game as well as story.  Games with perfect information can be a little too thinky sometimes.  Don't get me wrong I enjoy thinky games, but I don't enjoy playing them with AP prone people.  I like games to flow quickly.

An enjoyable, somewhat light game that hovers somewhere between Settlers and Puerto Rico in terms of accessibility.  When teaching to light gamers, one must emphasize the importance of civilization cards, or else they will be disheartened by the final score.  Not a lot of room for aggressive/competitive play, except in a 2-player game (it scales to two pretty well).

Another worker placement game of which we already saw so many in the past years. Gameplay is satisfactory but don't look for anything new in this game. Different roads to victory apear to be present but do not seem very balanced. Opinions may change after more plays.

After playing this a bit more there seems to be more to the game than meets the eye at first glance. Also the learning curve was a bit steeper than I expected from a so called family game. While I agree that it can be played as a family game in a casual way, I'm also starting to apreciate the game more as a gamers game. The competition for the different assets in the game can be fierce and timing is so important. The downside when playing it competetively is that there is still a pretty big luck factor involved in getting the resources.

Fairly straighforward gameplay in this game, because the actions tend to make some thematic sense.  It has several paths to victory, which I love.  Occasionally one person can get hosed by bad die rolls, but overall it's a quality game that does a good job of mitigating the luck factor.  New players often overlook how significant the endgame scoring can be, but they will learn quickly after the first game.

The big problem I have with this game is the length.  Things tend to get a little repetitive and the game goes on for a very long time especially with 4 players.  This is made even worse if any of the players suffer from analysis-paralysis, as they can lock up every single time they are supposed to place workers on the board.  I want to love this game, and my family wanted to love it as well, but the length just outlasts the fun.  For the first hour it tends to be a really enjoyable game, but at that point I suddenly find myself wishing the game would just end.  I'll play again if asked, but I'm not going to seek out opportunities to play.

RATING: 4
Initial impression.

I was expecting to hate it (dice! my nemeses!), but I actually quite liked it.

You essentially have 1 of 4 options in worker placement - increase your food infrastructure, increase your workers, increase modifiers to die rolls, or go for points via resources, buildings, and cards.

There are some issues with "pip" (the dots on the dice) balance that I might have with the various methods of infrastructure generation which might become more obvious with repeated play, but I'm interested in giving it another go.

UPDATE:

Meh.  Not horrible, too long for a filler, too light for time commitment.

I think this is my favorite resource management game, emphasize think here!  I do know it is one of my favorite games of all time as well. It scales fantastically for 2 players, and beats the snot out of Lords of Waterdeep. It hits a sweet spot in game length of about 90 minutes. While some argue there's too much luck involved I don't agree with them. Yes rolling "unlucky" could hurt you, but when you can stack the odds by devoting more dice to get what you need, I think it becomes the epitome of "resource management" as you can work hard to counteract this "Unluck." I really enjoy this game.

Stone Age is a greeat example of a game that has enough randomnes to make every game different.  The coolest mechanic in the game is your ability to affect  randomness in your favour.  This game is really a hidden gem.  Another fantastic part of this game is it completely visual.  The board, cards and items used in the game are without words.  They use icons that represent actions.  This means the game is playable by any nationality as long as the rules are translated.  The game is light enough to play with your family and has a great learning value for children with respect to math, managing resources and making choices.  In my first game, a 10 year old beat us all.  Most enjoyable loss of my life.  I highly recommend this game and will go out on a limb and predict that it will win several awards this year.  Game designers need to play this game and incorporate the the quality, the randomness and the flow found in this game into their games.  This is a winner.

It is similar to the awful [i][gameid=24480][/i] in that you assign your workers to areas to work for resources which you use to buy victory points, where you also have to allocate a worker to claim. You also have the option of growing the number of workers you have as well and you always have to feed the workers you have. The complete randomness of turn order in [i]PotE[/i] has been replaced by rolling a die for each worker at an area which allows you to somewhat control the randomness and that is enough to make this a game worth playing and owning.

My first play (4 persons): I won with 221 point, the second has had 204 points, the third 202. I played hunger (only in one round i didn't got -10 points), the second has had 3, 3 und 2 tools, the third has had permanent eating. I made in the first 5 rounds 4 times children. that was fun. 
Gold washing in the Stone Age. A bit of "Pillars of the Earth" and a little bit of "Agricola". Nice game. Good job, Bernd.

It's a fantastic game mechanically and I do think the theme works really well. But it just kind of took too long to constantly wait for people to resolve their turns without a big enough pay off! The interaction of assigning meeples was great, but the resolution phase is a chore on everyone's go but your own. Avoid 4 player for this reason.

Yet, irritatingly 3 and 2 player have restrictions to the map which are very limiting... tough one to score.

OK, there is nothing wrong with Stone Age. Nothing at all. I just didn't find it very exciting or engaging.

It is very light, perhaps a little bit too reliant on the dice, and a touch repetitive for my taste but not a bad game by any means. The play tends to be fairly tactical, though with some room for longer term planning.

Actually, do you know what has been niggling at me about the game - the food. It is too easy to get. You never have a difficult decision about whether to go for some points or gather food - always go for the points, you can syphon up some food with your last couple of meeples. Perhaps it is just uneccessary.

«What’s gold doing in the stone age»?
If you manage to dismiss the anachronism of gold exploitation in the stone age as a ludic licence, then there’s nothing else in this game that can annoy you: quick enough to understand and master, Stone Age makes for a good game, even though one you can’t play too frequently.
After a good handful of runs indeed it gets pretty repetitive, for the strategies are more or less the same all over each game: hence success usually smiles on the one player who just made one right move at the right time.

It has luck. Luck of the draw on what cards come out when. Luck of the dice for resources. Luck of the draw again for what huts will appear. But you know what, it was a very good thing in this game. Worker placement games can be a bit structured and someone can precisely figure out exactly what needs to be done at what point in the game. The dice eliminate the ability to optimize precisely which gives the game a bit of risk (and fun). I almost didn't pick this one up because I was somewhat turned off by Pillars (which it had been compared to, play wise and visually) but I'm glad I did (and I still have Pillars on my trade list). The scoring is "mathy" but that's cool. Everything scores it seems but you have to pay attention to what you are doing to get a winning score.

A 28th birthday present. 

My grandma and sister are my two most frequent gaming partners, and this is towards the top of their complexity curve, so this is the heaviest game I get to play on a regular basis. 

Our early metagame was card focused, with a heavy emphasis on building fields and expanding the tribe. I then switched to a low-growth, building-focused strategy, and they eventually followed. Now I'm back to an expansion-oriented strategy.

I appreciate how easy this game was to grasp during the first play.  I had a lot more fun than I expected to have on the first play of a worker-placement game.

It's also standing up to repeated plays for me.  This game taught me that the more complicated games like Caylus, while interesting, are less alluring to me than games like this which I can get to the table often and with new players and always have fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The quintessential Worker Placement game.  Strangely gets flak for its dice but the randomness is mostly in the Civ cards and buildings.  Not a groundbreaking design but it pares the genre down to the essentials and manages to stay interesting through repeated plays (not easily accomplished by its peers).  I do wish the tools/farming/baby spots weren't such obvious picks and that the resources were slightly more balanced (seems like wood is the clear favorite).

Light, fast but enough thought in every move to keep you hooked. Truly great game. I play this on line and it is a perfect reproduction of the board game. The luck of the dice is the only downside of this game although for me it adds a touch of randomness. Since playing this game ALOT on line i have come to realise what an underrated 2 player game it is. Becomes very very tactical.

RATING: 9
Worker placement game with a set collection element. It's still interesting after 50+ plays because it has it all: some randomness that can still be mitigated to a certain extent, tactics, and a little strategy as well. However, even though the artwork is great, thematic integration is cringeworthy. Why aren't people starving to death? Why would people from the Stone Age build huts with blocks of stone and gold? Aside from these logic flaws, scoring is too convoluted because of the huge swings of the final scoring. All in all, it's still quite possibly the greatest family game around, certainly the best I know.

I really dig the workers as dice mechanic. It makes the game a little more accessible than other worker placement games.

RATING: 7
8 plays.  A dicefest for sure, but it's an enjoyable game of resource management and luck mitigation.  Just do the best you can with what you've got.  Lots of hidden points that come from purchased cards... so card counters with photographic memories might spoil the game (unlikely).  Seemed to run long for this type of game... but I guess it needs some length to balance out the luck of the dice.  Gameplay is pretty straight-forward, and families like mine should like the game since it's challenging but not overly complex.  Main problem is that it only goes up to 4 players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Unquestionably the best gateway worker placement game I've played. Far easier to explain than Agricola. While I'd always be willing to play it, there are certainly better, deeper worker placement games that you'll want to move on to.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Excellent game. I've played a lot recently, both ftf and on BSW, but I still want to play this again. 

There is plenty to do in this game, you need a play or two of it to see what strategies work the best. Nice balance of growth vs feeding and a rush for the best picks of worker locations creates some interesting mechanics. I've learned that huts multipliers are rarest, so more tools or more people may help more (although saying that, I have won a game by pushing for huts - I did have 9 in a 4 player game).

The no feeding strategy can be pretty powerful if you have a lot of people early on, as "only" losing ten points a turn can easily be countered by the additional actions you can take with at least 3 people who are not hunting every turn.

It is hard for people to recognize that the "luck of the dice" impacts every player in this game equally, so it becomes a scape-goat.

My two gaming contexts are my geeky friends and my wife. I bought this for her. While the theme isn't geeky enough and there isn't enough direct conflict for them, it is very good for her as she enjoys light worker placement games without significant screwage. This is one of my first forays into worker placement games and I admit that I do like it more than Agricola though that might change with more experience with the latter. Stone Age has beautiful components and is very accessible to learn. It's not what I call a brain burner though more competitive players have some opportunities to think more intensely about blocking the strategies of the other. While I wouldn't say it has generated exhileration during or stories afterwards, it is a pleasant game that I'm happy to play. Many worker placement games I've encountered can't boast that same level of easy enjoyment.
Update: The thing that kept bothering me about Stone Age is that there is no real engine building. The last turn is the same as the first. The continuity comes through counting and remembering more than I like. It's easy and light fun, but I think Lords of Waterdeep asks the same investment and provides more return.

I really enjoy this game but it plays a little long. There is a very large learning curve, though, which can put new players at a serious disadvantage. The box says 2-4 players, but it doesn't scale terribly well. It's much better with the full compliment of players.

Nice worker placement game which adds a lot of luck through the dice rolls. I actually prefer this one to Agricola and others of its ilk, and it's been a hit with everyone I introduce it to.

Love it! The game is mega fun. I will not judge it as the other games because before You play it You know there is A LOT of randomness (you can increase the luck factor during a game). You will find some strategy here. There is many ways to develop Your society and not enough time for everything. Appearance - madness. Implementation - one of the better-made games. Theme - strongly felt. Actions really build theme in this game. There is always traffic in cottage where You can make kids :P Watch out for negative interaction between players. Great for 2 players!
Minus - lack of little scorebook for points. Counting in the end is pain in the ass without it (thanks God You can download and print one from BGG). 
Finally - right now it is my favorite easy, economic game. 
"Catan" can rest in peace after buying Stone Age! :D

A nice, light worker placement game with a fair amount of strategy.  It plays fairly quickly, is well produced and fun!

I find Stone Age a bit light, but I'm usually willing to play it.  This is a good game to get people into worker placement games, and even makes a good gateway game for some players.  I'll be holding onto this one as I can see it being played a couple of times a year.

I had sold my original copy of Stone Age and have now reacquired it.  Such a great light game that still has some decision space, and great for introducing new players to worker placement.

For me this is just about a perfect game.  It's engaging, likeable and fun.  It's strategic, but not too much.  It provides multiple paths to victory but not so you can't change paths mid-game should circumstances dictate.  It looks and feels fantastic, the components and artwork are first class (even my cup remains pristine and odour-free), it's easy to explain but has enough depth to keep you thinking all the way to the end.

It has luck, of course, but the luck can be mitigated with skill and forethought.  It's my favourite game and I would play it anytime and anywhere.

Like this lots - I can see the comparisons with Pillars but I much prefer this to Pillars. Yes it's got randomness but in a way you can strategically plan, you can go into this game thinking 'hmm I'll try X' and be able to - with the pillars random order draw I find that game much more tactical in you just plan the turn. Stone Age is quick (can't see a game lasting more than 1 hour), almost a filler - and in that role I like it. Only change I make is have everyone start with one tool, that seems to fix any problem with an early really bad roll.

Beautiful artwork here, but with a pasted on theme.
No way through the game I have the feeling I`am in the Stone Age. 
I personally think the game is to long for me.
It tends to be too repetetive. Place worker, role dice, earn Vp. If it were a 45 min game, that would be nice. But 90 min to max 2 hours, way too long. The game engine works nice and you can try out a lot of strategies.
But in the end I`am missing here something.
I would prefer AoE III or Pillars for such a kind of game.

What could be more entertaining than stone aged love and homestead building long before indoor plumbing...?  Apparently maybe not too much?!!

This game is an extremely pretty game where everything is easy on the eys and very sturdy components with minimal set-up time.

Once player order is established, each turn intiative is passed and selections are then made to aquire a privelage you would like for that current turn.

Players then take turns claiming rights to various positions/resources/buildings/"and cards" which will gain them commodities or the opportunity to trade for scoring points now or various cards tallied later, at the end of the game.  Currency is found in in the form of resources(brick-lumber stone and gold) which ire aquired to trade. 

Trade well and manage your offspring and food gathering well and you will keep the human race successful.

This game has several mechanics that work pretty well and has an interesting twist on worker placement, but the game ultimately comes down to luck. Thankfully the game provides mechanisms to mitigate bad rolls and you can still pull off some tactical plays, but this is more of a family or gateway game where everyone can get involved and still have fun.

RATING: 7.75
Opening moves are a bit obvious (farm, tool, new worker) unless you've got specific card multipliers swapping those positions around; but it's about as good as they get for intro/gateway worker placement.  Theme definitely comes through better than Waterdeep, and is more accessible to a wider group than D&D references.

I didn't think that I would appreciate to roll dice for resources but it succeeds to be more about risk management than luck. Hungry workers is a nice touch. Starvation can be close through the game but that doesn't stop you from gambling with the food distribution.

RATING: 8
After 1 play, I am thoroughly enamored with Stone Age. It packs a lot of tough decisions into a small time frame, while keeping the players involved and minimizing downtime.  I love that it is relatively easy to evaluate almost everything in the game in terms of pips or VPs, and yet the decisions are still not obvious.  I love that there are multiple viable strategies.  I love the feeling of expanding capability as you build toward the end.  I love that it is simple enough to teach to non-gamers, and short enough to keep their attention.  I love that it played very well with 3, even though it was designed for 4, and it looks like it would work well with 2 as well.

Update: 8 plays now.  This is a game of valuation - you evaluate which move will get you the most points, and take it.  The game is not entirely tactical, but almost.  The valuation of actions is relatively easy with practice, and I am finding that I can play mostly on auto-pilot.  Which is not to say that it's a bad game, but it is not a really gripping experience either.  

I still say that it plays well with a wide variety of people, is relatively easy to teach, and is presented well.  This game deserves a spot in most collections because it fits lots of "casual" gaming situations.  But I wouldn't say it's a favorite anymore - there's just not enough depth to it.  I will still suggest it, though, when I think a lighter, well themed title will go over well with the rest of the group.

Stone Age is a blast and I would certainly recommend it if youre looking for a semi-light worker placement game.

This game is very approachable and I have had quite a bit of success introducing it to a few non-gamers.

Felt very Pillars of the Earth, only with dice.  It was okay but not overly compelling for me -- if I'm in the mood for a worker placement game, I'll pull out Caylus (one of my faves) and not have to spend the game hoping that my hunters can roll well.

Another solid Euro. I liked this more than Trajan or Marco Polo, two other recent Euros I've played in my quest to play everything in the BGG top-100. It's more streamlined than either of those games, but on the other hand like those games doesn't bring anything new or exciting to the table either. Good playtime that didn't overstay its welcome. I'm not a huge fan of the dice here, and there didn't seem to be enough to mitigate the luck (although the tools can help, sure, it's still swingy). That said, I think the game might be too stale without them. Not in a hurry to play again, but I definitely would play if it was hitting a table.

Edit 09/04: bumped down to a 6. Too light and too much luck. Still ok tho.

Along with Puerto Rico and 7 Wonders, Stone Age rounds out my three very favorite games. The game components are superb, the hide dice cup is just perfect, but most importantly the game is perfect. It's something that plays well with 2 - 4 and to me is the best resource management game hands down. It's not overly complex and can be taught relatively quickly to non-gamers and has just the right amount of screw you opportunities to make the interaction adequate and not make it too overbearing or un-fun.

Dice are back!! I have had enough of Risk years ago, but games like Yspahan and Stone Age have found a way to use them as an appropriate mechanic for enjoyable game play. I played with my younger group of kids, and they all enjoyed placing their people figures, and did quite decently. I liked that it challenged their math skills as well. I could tell that they were not grasping the civilization cards though, since I smoked them on the final scoring with those cards. They did well with scoring the buildings, but the civilization card scoring was not as apparent to them. So far, very pleased with the game play, even though there is a lot of rolling the dice. The bits are excellent for the theme. There needs to be more gold pieces but I use the gold from Citadels to compensate. The rules presentation is one of the clearest and free of FAQ reference of any new game I have played. UPDATE: Kids are catching on to the strategy and playing more for the points. Very enjoyable family game. And there is a neat element of tension with taking the civ cards to either enhance your own bonuses or block an opponent - but having to sacrifice an opportunity to place a worker on a much needed field or tool space. Great game.

RATING: 8
What a beautiful game.  For that reason alone, I'll always keep this.  I knew my wife would love the theme, and she did, but the components still make me smile every time I see them--Beautiful board artwork, meeples, shaped wooden resources, food tokens, first-player marker, and more.  My wife and I love the dice cup, but unfortunately later versions had smelly leather which ruined it for some gamers.  The gameplay for me did start to feel predictable--only a few paths to victory, but after some time away, I've started enjoying this one again.  I'll always play when someone asks, but won't suggest it too often.  This is a game I would strongly recommend to people for the "game after a gateway game" experience (like Settlers of Cataan or Ticket to Ride).

RATING: 5
Honestly I'm not a fan.  I find the luck element to be too strong - maybe it's that I'm horrifically unlucky but I find it bites me in the arse at every critical moment it could.  Additionally I cannot stand not having even a faint sense of how well I'm doing until the game has ended - I feel this is a strong weakness to the game, it is only afterwards when thinking about it that I can see where my mistakes were made.  There's little hope of adjusting on the fly to catch up to a runaway leader as you can't tell who that leader is (sure you can guess, but it's never better then a guess - and often an incorrect one).

Stone Age just rubs me the wrong way, I've never liked it and after 10 plays I still don't.  I'll play, because my friends are fun - but not because I enjoy the game itself (I enjoy the company) and the game is light enough that it doesn't impede on being social.

RATING: 3
Fundamentally broken. Going fourth in a 4 player game was a waste of time b/c the first player got more food by going up the food scale immediately. That's 3 less people to feed than the last player by the time he gets to move up the food scale. The only nice thing to say about this mess is that the art and components are superb.

This is Pillars of the Earth/Leonardo da Vinci with added luck stemming from repeated dicefests.

Love hate relationship with this one.   The game is well designed with nice pieces, and multiple paths to victory.  Also seems to have fairly good replayability due to the cards.

One aspect I don't like is the sizable disadvantage that the last player in round 1 has.  The player who starts 2nd actually gets a huge advantage imo.

Mostly play online, can't seem to get enough of it at the moment.  Hits that sweet spot of luck vs. strategy, and scales amazingly well.

[Update 9/8/09] Downgrading to an 8.  Still enjoy this a great deal; I think I'm just getting pickier in my old age.

[Update 11/2010] Now at 7.  Still a good game, and I'll happily play it, but it's not the first game I reach for.

(Update 9/5/2013) Played again recently.  It's still a solid, enjoyable game, and an excellent introduction to worker placement.  Shame I don't like the expansion (even without the awful title.)  What makes this game work is the careful balance of resource value vs. rarity.  The expansion, IMO, tosses that out the window.

10 is very unique - but so is Stone Age! Gorgeous artwork and a relatively simple gameplay easy to teach.

The mix of luck and stragedy are a sweet symphony working perfect together. I hear a lot of people complaining about the unforgiving dice, but to me it makes sense with the theme; you are not quite sure how productive the men you send working or hunting will be. Have they had any obstacles in the harsh souroundings? It makes sense to me.

Stone Age is a very peaceful game, and every single time I play it, I enjoy it 100 pct.

Stone Age, like its compatriot also designed by Tummelhofer, St. Petersburg, is a rock-solid mid-level Euro.  While it has dice, they are used to good effect - that is, the luck element is still low, and can be planned for.  There is a lot to like here, multiple paths to victory and many nice interlocking parts.  This is a nice lean Euro, very little fat.  My only question thus far is the balance of the civ cards... not that they are unbalanced, but that, at the end of the day, they are all that matter, so the win could wind up being based solely on who took what when.  If played by two skilled players (or two players paying close attention) it shouldn't matter, but I can't see how building huts is anything more than a somewhat lucrative sideline.  Like St. Petersburg, then, the endgame scoring can be a real bitch (in that it creeps up on you).  Really, this is a classic of its kind - we even love the stinky dice cup (so thematic)!

Much easier to pick up than Agricola but I think Agricola is a much better mental exercise and hence, I prefer Agricola. Now, my girlfriend may prefer Stone Age just for that reason but I don't like the many multipliers and scoring. and there's always the randomness of dice which some like but I think the odds of having 1 player with a great start and 1 with a horrible one are just too high.

in 2p, the luck of the randomness of the buildings/civ cards coming out determines far too much imo. hard to mitigate at times.

however, it's still a fun game. not so sure I'll like to play it as a tabletop as opposed to online though. hence, it's still a 7.

UPDATE2: I  love this game, especially on BSW, where 2p takes only 45 minutes or so. Online, it's a 10. Offline, it's a 9 for length and (some) fiddliness. It has just the right mix of luck and skill, depth and lightness.

Pretty much state of the art worker placement/harvesting/building game featuring a nice use of dice - it plays as smoothly as the rules read and the components and presentation are well up to scratch too.  Nothing here you won't have seen before and perhaps just a touch on the long side - even with three but more markedly with four - but, overall, very nice.  A few more plays trim the time a little and it also plays well - and quickly - with two, with admirably minor tweaks to the rules - uprated.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

POSITIVE POINTS:

++ Good light-medium weight gateway worker placement game with a few paths to victory path.
++ I love the ressource collection mechanism in this game, which feel more thematic than having a fixed number of ressources per workers: Send x workers, get x dice to roll (some control luck is thus involved), then use some tool to get better returns.
++ I like having the possibility to do "Tools" to be able to change the results of the dice and thus mitigate the luck factor in dice rolling, but still stay true to the theme (having tools help gathering more ressources efficiently).
++ Easy to teach and fast to play.
++ There is one expansion available for this game (which is useful to refresh the game when we have overplayed it).


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- Gameplay can become somewhat repetitive after a few games.
-- Blocked worker-placement spaces for 2 and 3 players could have been depicted directly on the board to make it easier to remember.
-- Maybe too few paths to victory to keep some good replayability.

Played this again for the first time since it came out in 2008. Wow, it's just really a dull game. No dramatic tension, no pace, no pulse, no punch to the decision-making process. That a game this uninteresting would have done so well is mildly dispiriting. It's well-crafted, there just isn't anything there.
---
Not bad. I enjoyed my one play. It's definitely got overtones of Pillars of the Earth, or maybe Aladdin's Dragons, but it's definitely not either of those games. Two things sort of stand out, the randomness of resource collection, and the maintenance requirements. The random resource production is actually much cleverer than it first looks, mixing calculus of both risk and efficiency. The food pressures are sort of neat, in that you have to feed your workers, which acts as a drag on growth.

Two things worry me. Firstly, on first inspection, it's just not that thematic. To me, it's obviously an evolution of earlier games (Pillars and Aladdin's Dragons, primarily), sort of transported to the stone age, without the traditional thematic trappings. All the game bits are clever, but they don't seem to function as a unified whole in a thematic way.

Secondly, this designer's previous game (Saint Petersburg) had a very similar feel - but was critically unbalanced. Similarly, there are a lot of moving parts here, and I am rather nervous about the balance.

Anyway, a fun game, one I'll play again, but not a buy for me. I liked Pillars of the Earth better - it's more interesting, more nuanced, more thematic, and better-paced, without being noticeably more complex - and they just aren't so different that I feel Stone Age adds anything to my collection.

Original game but for me it starts to feel a bit tedious with the grabbing and placing of wooden bits turn after turn.  I find myself wanting to hurry and buy all the huts in a stack just to finish the game and tally up the score.

The parts are fantastic and durable (save for the lame cardboard stand-up cheiftan).  The genuine leather dice cup adds to the theme tremendously.  I like how there are no words written on the cards or game board itself; only artwork and numbers.  It adds to the caveman theme going on.

I'll keep playing this game, just not very often.

RATING: 7
Reminds me a lot of Pillars of the Earth, but I like this a little better.  Deploy your cavemen to gather stuff which you then use to acquire other stuff for points.  I really like the use of dice to acquire resources, as it makes the game a little unpredictable.  My main gripe is the game can run a little long for what it is, but still a fun time!

[thing=34635][/thing]is a simplistic worker placement resource management game.  Each round, players take turns allocating one or more of their workers to a single area on the board.  Five areas provide resources: food, wood, brick, stone, gold.  The resources are acquired by rolling dice and expending the pips; better resource require more pips for a single unit.  Three areas improve your resource collection abilities.  You can reduce your need to gather food, increase the value of your dice rolls, or gain extra workers.  You can convert all resources except food into victory points equal to their cost in pips by trading them (usually in batches of three) for buildings.  This mechanic is a little reminiscent of [thing=39683]At the Gates of Loyang[/thing], which incentivizes players to convert as much cash as possible to victory points each turn.  Alternatively, you can spend resources of any type to acquire civilization cards which give a short term benefit (e.g., a resource) and provide end game victory points.  To maximize victory points, the cards encourage either set collection or specialization (e.g., get lots of people).  At the end of each round, feed each worker a food.  And that's the game.  Place workers, roll dice, collect resources, trade resources for VP, lather, rinse, repeat.  

As someone who really enjoys meaty games with thematically integrated mechanics, the popularity of Stone Age is confounding.  I don't mean to imply that it is a bad game, but I consider it only marginally more entertaining than similarly colorful, innocuous, mechanic-driven, overly balanced fillers, such as [thing=30869]Thebes[/thing] or [thing=27173]Vikings[/thing], and I would have expected it to be similarly rated (i.e., down around 100-120).  Oddly, I have no problem with Stone Age's use of dice (if you were about to fire off a snarky comment about the game being less luck-based than it appears, you can stop right now).  As a regular poker player, I can appreciate the way that the game implements risk management into resource acquisition.  But unlike most resource management games, the resources have no function.  They are acquired solely to be converted into VP or spent (interchangeably) on cards.  A great example of the thematic disconnect that results is that, during our game, players couldn't decide whether the gray wooden bits were supposed to be stone, iron, or silver.  Why couldn't they tell?  Because it didn't really matter.  In the same vein, for a game that spends so much time on colorful veneer (caveman-shaped meeples, rustic leather dice cup, art by [person=11825]Michael Menzel[/person]), the mechanics are surprisingly transparent, and are often anti-thematic.  I have three civilization cards.  One has a picture of a large-breasted statute, one has a picture of a fern, one has a picture of a cart.  Yay, I get 9 points!  Why?  How?  Who cares?!  I spent a gold, a stone, and a wood to build a building.  Yay, I get 14 points!  What kind of building?  Who cares?!  What does it do?  Gives me 14 points!  Yay!

Are we having fun yet?  For me, if a game presents no challenge, it provides no fun.  Stone Age is not entirely devoid of challenge, but it so exposes its simplistic mechanics that what results is little more than a mathy puzzle begging to be calculated.  In the process, the game also diverges from its theme in a way that's at times quite jarring.  I could see this as an intermediate step for new gamers transitioning from [thing=13]Settlers[/thing] to [thing=3076]Puerto Rico[/thing], but I'm not entirely convinced such a step is needed.  Stone Age is not a meaty game.  It is not a thematically cohesive game.  It is consequently not a particularly enjoyable game.  Instead, it is yet another entrant in the so-light-it's-kinda-pointless genre of games that I'll probably never understand.

Great for beginners I think

Fantastic Worker Placement game.  Plays a little long for my liking, but very easy and plenty of decisions and routes to victory.  A+

First game took a little over 2 hours, but I think now that we will start grabbing civ cards a lot earlier the game will finish a lot sooner as well.  The 2 hour game length is a little underestimated.  I am taking out time to learn the game, and the break for fireworks, but still feel we played for more than 2 hours.  It is a great game though and we didn't even notice how long we played for.  With future games we should figure how to get closer to the 90 minutes marked on the side of the box.  

Nice balance of strategy and luck make for a well rounded game.  Theme even works as well.  It could esaily be pasted with something different, without much effort, but still is good.  (7/4/09)


Wow, six months later we see how much we LOVE this game.  One of our favourites in our collection.  May be a 10, but definitely can be said to be a 9.5  Love the strategy, love the luck.  I don;t know what I was thinking about the pasted on theme.  I am kinda right but I still love the theme and how it goes with the whole game.  Brilliant. (2/5/10)

Three placements are far more important than the others, which gives the beginning of each turn a scripted feel. The rest of the game is just collecting resources and trading them in for victory points, which is kind of dull and mathy because of how the huts pay out.

As for the dice rolling, rolling good feels like a little bonus that will come in handy on later turns, but rolling badly, like under six with four dice, is very very frustrating.

Agricola Lite is right. Still, though, in this case that's not really a bad thing. 90% of the fun without the fiddliness. Loses some depth, obviously.

Stone Age is pretty standard worker placement, but its simple ruleset and the dice make it a good one. Seems like this would be a good step up from things like Settlers for people new to the hobby.

I have kind of mixed feelings on the dice. They make the game feel more accessible and add some essential variety, but the game does feel sort of long to lose from poor rolling. At least, though, you can increase your chances for rolling what you need. I guess I just haven't played enough to figure out how important rolling what you want all the time (or, more importantly, never rolling what you want) is.

Has gotten better with each play.  This is a really fun game.  The artwork and components are top-notch, and rolling for resources with so many dice keeps the energy level up.  It has just the right amount of luck and strategy for my family, and they have some control over the length of the game as well.  The game ends when a stack of huts/cards is depleted, and one of my family members enjoys ending the game quickly, regardless of her standing.  It certainly makes things a little tighter.  This is an excellent game to play with kids who feel comfortable playing Settlers of Catan.

Stone Age is probably the best introductory worker placement game out there.  It is incredibly easy to teach, the mechanics are smooth, and the choices in the game are not overwhelming.  As in any good worker placement game, blocking one's opponents is a key part of the game, but there are so many ways to score points such that even if one is blocked from carrying out a particular plan, a change in strategy and collection of appropriate civilization cards can still lead to a win.  I especially like the calculated risks one has to take with the dice in gathering food and resources.  Very good for two players as well!

I don't know why I like this game as much as I do.  Everything in it is random.  From what actions the players choose, from the totals of your dice rolls, to what cards come out when you are in a given position in turn order.  I think it is because there is something to be said for a simple tactical maximization game.  The game rewards those who choose a sound strategic path and play towards that singular strategy for the entire game.  Just fun to play and amazingly well produced.

A middling entry in the overstuffed worker placement genre. Combines worker placement with the other recent euro fetish; dice. 4 player ran about 90 minutes, which is OK, and could play much quicker if everyone just rolled at once resolving stuff. Not altogether unpleasant. 

Update: I have to say, this game has grown on me tremendously. After playing dozens of dicey euros, there are very few I would rather play than this. With experienced players, this takes less than an hour. A perfect length for its weight.

People who think luck plays a large part in this game should play some online. A lot deeper than it gets credit for.

This is seriously the best game for introducing people to the worker placement genre! At least before Lords of Waterdeep came out, which I also highly recommend for new gamers! After I've played it many times, I have actually upgraded my rating a bit as it's also a pretty good game with experienced gamers.

There are many different paths to victory, though some strategies seem to be weaker than others; the tools strategy hasn't won a single time in my games, whereas the food strategy (focusing on the food track) and the starvation strategy are both strong strategies to choose as is focusing on buildings if you can get the x3 huts civilization card. The green civilization cards with the inventions have been okay but haven't been gamechanging. Overall though I think there are many strategies which work almost equally well, at least they have done in our games. The expansion adds even more variety and strategies to pursue.

Furthermore, as in most other good euro games, there are a lot of things you want to do on your turn - but you aren't allowed to do so because the places are either occupied by other players or you simply don't have any meeples left, and this makes the game one of my favorite games with new players! 
However, it's also great to play with gamers (though it isn't a game I would play very often as it's a bit too simple now that I've been introduced to better WP games like Agricola). 

Even though there is a lot of dice rolling, it isn't totally random; you can mitigate the rolls with your tools, and even if you don't have tools the number of die rolls shouldn't affect you that much during the game unless you're really unlucky. I really like the civilization cards and the huts and like how you have to evaluate the value of the cards - not only what they're worth to yourself but also to the other players, so you might want to grab that cheap green civilization card even though you don't need it, just to avoid the other players getting it.

I AM LOVING THIS GAME---raised my rating as the fun and the multiple paths to victory are making this a game I eagerly anticipate. So well executed. 

It doesn't hurt that people pick up the basics of the game fairly smoothly---easy to teach. Gateway Worker Placement of choice for me. 

A NOTE ON STARVATION: I wish people called it the 'BEGGING' strategy rather than the  starvation strategy. The idea that starving, emaciated players can out-produce your well-fed tribe members is tough to accept in such an otherwise surprisingly intuitive game. Besides, they aren't starving---they're BEGGING! Also, it's clear to my gaming sensibilities that the penalty should be two per unfed person.

* * * * * 

Update 04/09: feeling more mathy lately than when we first started playing. Which is okay, but I remember enjoying the game more when I understood it less. It's fun to talk 'pip' optimization with the gang, but it sometimes feels like we're playing 'Who is the best bargain hunter.' Not nearly as cold as Puerto Rico can---in all its brilliance---sometimes feel, and I am now okay with the fact that the best players don't always have to win. There is a lot of randomness that matters here. The best/most experienced win enough, but it's healthy for people to have hope when they play.

Update 10/11: This game has transcended into the 'reunion game' I play with some of my students who graduated when they stop by for a visit. I still love teaching this one to new people, and it has become the 'comfort food' of gaming for some people I always love to see. Therefore, I love this game---it has transcended what is strictly within the box. And I am glad to see that it has been given a fair amount of respect and has a solid place within the hobby.

Stone Age is one of my family's favourite games, though given the theme and the fact that two members of my family are anthropologists may explain that slightly.

Stone Age is a worker placement game (like Carcasonne).  Players control a stone-age tribe competing for dominance.  Points are acquired through buying cultural artefact cards, building structures, making tools, agricultural progress, and increasing your population.

Players go around the board placing workers in various locations.  Each location allows the player to produce one of five resources (food, wood, brick, stone, or gold), increase your population, improve your tools (which makes resource-gathering easier), farm (producing a constant stream of food), spend resources on a building, or buy a card.

The mechanics are quite simple, and the entire game sticks to the theme of stone-age tribes fairly well.  Gameplay does not take a terribly long time, which makes it work for a broad age/skill range.

An excellent resource management and acquisition game.  Different than a game like Lost Valley, in that the board is fixed, but it is very much geared around gathering resources to build huts and purchase cards.  A great game, with a multitude of reasonable strategies.

Fast playing 'worker placement' game in the same vein as Caylus.  The game really works as the big decision each turn is quick to work out which gives the game a good flow.  Highly Recommended as it seems like it would be a great way to introdue this type of game to newcomers, or a solid worker-placement gateway game.

We did sort of a blind buy on this one.  Went into the store looking for something Puerto Rico-esque to hopefully satiate my wife's resource collecting game itch.  After a few recommendations both in-store and online we gave this a go.  I enjoy Puerto Rico, but at times get a bit confused.  I found Stone Age far easier to grasp and a bit more entertaining to play.  Good "bits" as well, and I think we will benefit from the upgraded pieces (wooden food tokens, etc.) for our future plays of Stone Age.  Some have mentioned the "stinky" leather dice cup, but we've been told ours don't stink as bad as some others!  I guess that's a plus?!

Fun little gateway game, interesting and with enough depth that you will pull it out again.

After more play stills enjoys it greatly.  Enjoy it a lot more than playing on BSW, because of added interaction and playing with friends (duh) so upped the rating.

Downrated in feb 12. Don't know but this game hasn't been as enjoyable recently, I think after repeatedly play, especially on Bsw, this game is losing its depth and becoming quite predictable. There are different but limited strategy and obvious imbalances in the civ cards

RATING: 4
This game fills some nice "slots" in the collection. It is enjoyable with two people. It's low on the conflict level, so you really can't hurt other people's feelings. I like the game, but there's a slight sensation that creeps in where it feels too mathematical. 

Some people may disparage the dice, but I think that's a very effective tool in the game. It's nice to have a little bit of "push your luck" element and adds to some of the tough choices.

Revised comment: dropped this down to a "6". It's a fine, game, but it's a bit "polite" and I find myself reaching for other titles instead. It's still a good choice for those that are conflict-phobic.

OK, another revised rating: bumped it back up to a 7. It's a solid game, and there are tension in the choices, despite its polite play. My problem, I think, is that I keep using it as a two player game. With more people, I think the tension becomes much more interesting with each worker placement more crucial.

Nope, check that: dropped it back to a "6". It's a great entry for worker placement games, but I've got plenty other games that are getting my attention. I'm willing to potentially trade this.

Update: Traded it away, along with Cold War: CIA vs. KGB to swap for Manila. It's not that Stone Age is bad... it's just that I own other games that I'll always reach for first. The fact that my wife was lukewarm to the game sealed its fate. And, something will always bug me about spending a gold/stone/brick to build a hut that mathematically equals the same points I just went and fetched. What's the point of all that piece swapping again?

RATING: 8
Gateway worker placement, place workers and roll dice to determine how many of each resource you get. It's very easy to explain and the concepts are simple to grasp. You need to balance getting food to feed your people each round and resources to buy either huts or civilization cards which score you points. In our 2-player game we seemed to alternate a lot between increasing our food and going to the love shack so the first few rounds felt a little scripted because of that, however once we had plenty of people we were able to move the game along rather quickly. I ended up getting a number of brown civilization cards scoring 105 points in end game scoring to win. The downsides to me are the fact that you can really strike out in getting resources if you roll poorly and not knowing what huts are coming up beyond the few displayed means it may be tough to gauge what resources you should go after on your turn to prepare for future rounds. I would always be happy to play this, I just wish there was a little bit more to it or a little less luck.

More of the same as far as worker placement games go. There is nothing solid I can point to and say "I like how that was done. I'd like to see more of that in future games." The stone age theme doesn't make sense with the mechanics of building stuff by combining resources to get VPs. It involves lots of dice rolling in a slow, dull way. It is well crafted but too familiar to raise more than a passing interest. 

Update: I was thinking of increasing my rating for this to a seven because it is good fun and well balanced. The trouble is that playing more I have noticed that turn order in the final round decides the winner more often than I am comfortable with.

The best introductory worker placement game available. It's a mish-mash of familiar mechanics, but somehow, it has boardgame umami. It just "feels" right when playing it.

EDIT: It finally overstayed its welcome. Kids are bored of it, wife thinks its hugely overrated. I think its biggest problem is that the only decisions you are really making are tactical rather than strategic.

I have the (very well done) iPhone version. It's an OK game, entertaining enough for what it is, but hardly groundbreaking -- too much of the heavy lifting seems to be done by the dice. I don't mind luck of the dice/cards in games at all, but die rolling should be a creator of uncertainty or friction in the system instead of the driving force in the game, and my impression of Stone Age is that an excellent strategy paired with crap die rolls will lose to random strategy with excellent die rolls.

Stone Age is easy to learn and simple to play. It has a nice balance between the tactical depth that should be in any worker placement game, and strategic planning. It is easy enough for my wife to play (thank you Tabletop), and yet it has some great depth to it. The components are also wonderful: the player and game boards are very good looking, and the cards and chits are of good quality.

After many plays, I still can't get enough of this game. It might not be as complex and interconnected as other worker placement games like Agricola, but its simplicity makes it very accessible and quick to play. I cannot recommend this game enough. Every board gamer should have this game.

Ok game with some interesting variety but the first few moves of the first few rounds seem pretty "locked in" in terms of what is best (people are going to always go for farm, love shack, tools) first and then mostly wood after that.

Slightly better than "usually willing to play". That's just a few pips above my 7.15 average.

I gave this game away as a birthday present to a fellow gamer. Stone Age is not too simple but not too complex. There are plenty of strategies a player can employ, and yet even inexperienced gamers can figure out and enjoy the game. What I like best are the cards that give you an immediate benefit and also double as clear end game points.

RATING: 3
I was supremely disappointed by this game. I liked it up until the end of my first (and only) play. Perhaps it might have been my high expectations that made me dislike it all the more, but I will probably never play this again. The starving strategy made me stop and think, "hey, maybe it *is* overrated", and what really ruined it for me was the utter lack of sense of scale. The civilisation cards, for instance, are quite overpowered, but they still lack consistency. There are just too many of them, some too strong, and one offering 3(!) points in a game where scores often reach into the hundreds. 

I can agree with another user who remarked that it is very annoying to not know your position on the score track until the end (since the cards can turn everything upside down). The luck component seems unnecessary. I will, however, gladly concede that the game's components and artwork are outstanding. 

Traded it for A Castle for All Seasons, which I think is a much, much better game than this.

My favorite game of GoF 2008. It is a nice medium-light resource management game. It has dice, so that may be a turn off for some (not me), but there are things that can be down to put some control into the randomness. The production value is excellent. There is not really any major new innovations here, but I don't really care as it is fun to play, is easy to teach, has little downtime between turns, and a pretty short playing time. Also, it comes with a dice cup!

Classic, wonderful game. I love the artwork, components, theme, game play--basically the whole experience. There are many avenues to win the game, but winning strategies definitely seem to be centered around getting cards. I love the lottery card where everyone gets something but the player of the card gets first dibs. There's plenty of dice rolling but luck doesn't completely determine outcomes. I would place Stone Age in my top 5 or 10 most cherished games. If I had to scale my collection down to just 10, Stone Age would, without question, make the cut.

RATING: 6
This is the most beautiful board of any game I own and I enjoy looking for little details when waiting for other players (which never is long). The leather dice cup is posh and appreciated.

One mentally slow man I played with was amazed at how anyone could absorb such complex rules, but my gripe is the opposite, which is that the most complicated the game gets isn't complex enough to engage my mind for playing it as often as I'd otherwise prefer to. Mentally slow players aside, I consider this a great gateway game.

Experience with this game taught me that a score track that circles a game board is a suboptimal and even boring thing for any game to put forth as the goal. I want my effort at playing the game to be for accomplishing something. Building something. Destroying something. Not moving a number. This game isn't boring, because the options and actions are interesting. I'm just saying the goal could've been better.

To justify my 4.9 rating: It's actually a pretty good game, but the depth isn't really there for me. As a Worker Placement game, it's the first one I would introduce people to, as there's not a whole lot else going on. (The second one would be Lords of Waterdeep or Caverna.) That said, the randomness of rolling dice for resource gathering, coupled with more randomness in how the cards and buildings come out, keep it below a 6 for me, and it would be a 5 except for there being so many other better options out there.

So, in summary: Good game, would play, but only if the more meatier games weren't available or if I were teaching someone the genre.

This game took forever to play,  we had to abandon it after a few hours. It got very tedious. 

It was fun to collect wood, clay and stone,  but after a while it seemed that there was no real difference which resource was picked up,  because when converted to points via cards, the number of points turns out the same.

Furthermore, the turn order seems to matter a lot.  Whoever plays first effectively plays the entire game with an extra man than whomever starts last, because the first thing the player does is 'make a baby' and it can only be used once per turn.

Hence the final ranking in our 4 player game ended up being the same as the turn order.

boring.

Fun worker placement game.  My 11 year old daughter loves this game (second only to Kingsburg).  Awesome variety of scoring choices.

I like this game a little more than Kingsburg.  In Kingsburg you roll first.  In Stone Age you select the action first.  I haven't found anyone who didn't enjoy this game.

Thinking about the expansion, but the theme of it is not appealing to me.  Jewelry?  C'mon.  How about expanding upon the hunting aspect?

Finally got to play this one - 2 players today.  Excellent game, easy to understand the rules, though we seemed to get really high scores.  Will have to go back and re-read the rules to make sure we were playing correctly (Yep, playing correctly - I see now that high scores are the norm).  My 7 yr. old was easily able to play and understand, though it went a bit long for him.  Really engaging game, very little downtime with 2 players, beautiful components, definitely a winner.  Rating may go up or down a bit once I get a few more games in.

1st few plays have been really really good. Looking forward to getting my own. WAY better than the last Tummelhoffer (St Petersburg). Has the "place yours dudes" thing like Leonardo and Pillars, but much more streamlined than both, and for my money, really focuses on the fun. There's lots of dice rolling love, so if you're allergic to dice, stay far far away. For everyone else, it's a blast. There's not too much of an economic ramp, so there's not too much difference betwen getting screwed by the dice early versus late, so people who don't get the dice love early don't have to freak out. I do have some ideas that will make the game even better. I need to write up something...

RATING: 5
To be honest I never really liked this game much from the start; and as my understanding of it grew, it did little to foster that sentiment. It is often heralded as the quintessential worker placement game: not only attractive to gamers, but also to family enthusiasts. I agree with the latter part of that statement, but I certainly do not with the former.

My main quibbles are a) that the game is too much infused with randomness to make it interesting and b) that there is too little variation to genuinely support more than a dozen games of play: strategically it is weak. First off: the dice. These can be murder from time to time, and there is nothing you can do about it. No, not even the tools help here: the idea is that someone who rolls a crappy result is simply at a disadvantage compared to someone who doesn't for he has to take extra steps in order to get someting done be it to use tools or forego taking a card or a hut or whatever. But don't make the mistake of thinking the dice the only source of randomness: the cards are just as bad. In one game with the expansion I drew 5 of the 9 artefacts simply by taking the top card of the deck. That is 81 - 16 = 65 (!) VP right there. Admittedly, such examples are flukes, which won't turn up in every game. So we get to problem b): in order to establish who is best at Stone Age would require many sessions so that skill trumps randomness. And that is the rub. Once you've seen a building strategy, a card strategy, a starvation strategy, or a rush strategy the rest is basically variation on a theme with varying amounts of these strategies rolled up into a single approach. Think the refrain of [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK_LN3XEcnw]this catchy tune[/url]. This will become boring rather quickly. At least to me. I will play a few more times for variation's sake, but after that I will be simply 'done' with Stone Age.

Now the family gamer on the other hand has a nicely illustrated game with a clear worker placement mechanism and a cool bit of dice rolling to look forward to. Resources enter the game in a nice way, and are spent in interesting ways. Combining the various aspects may actually be a challenge. For her, the game is a good investment. 

Still, I rate games based on how they make [i]me[/i] feel... So Stone Age doesn't reach much higher than a 5.

Acquired July 2008.

Love worker placement games.

I was going to avoid this one because I have so many worker placement games.  Caylus, Pillars, Leonardo, AOE III.  Then I played it.  This is the best introduction to worker placement games currently available for families.  

Additionally, this is a great math trainer for my kids.  The constant division needed to determine your resources is great practice for them.  The only thing I wish is that it continued the division higher than 6.

Another nice point about this game is that there really isn't a bad choice.  There are many ways to go with your workers and every game I've played has been very close.

This game works very well as a two player game too.

I like this game, but it has fallen out of favor since the purchase of Thurn and Taxis and Pandemic.

We'll be keeping it on the active shelf and it will probably get 3-5 plays per year.

My first experience with the game was playing against 2 people who have played the game a number of times, one of the people, decided to use the "starvation" strategy, and well, whooped us bad, like, easily 100 points above anyone else.  Anyway, I rank the game low, because it's feels like a "Figure out the gimmic and you're unstoppable" game.  Another example would be to every turn just go for wood, then buy cards, and keep doing that, you're bound to make a ton of VPs.

This worker placement game combines several winning elements seen in other games.  In particular you have gathering of resources of various values.  You use those resources to gain victory points either immediately (from the huts) or at the end of the game (from civilization cards).

I do appreciate that it's hard to know who's winning, as the endgame bonuses shift rapidly with each turn.  But the importance of rolling dice adds a random element that will turn off serious strategists.

A perfectly pleasant game, but it doesn't rock my world.

OK game. Played twice, so maybe my opinion doesn't count: 

Gameplay feels repetitive and, to be honest, a little shallow. I don't feel like I have accomplished anything by the end. The cards feel to powerful, and the huts really don't do anything besides ... being there.

I am underwhelmed and a bit disappointed. Good thing I didn't buy this.

EDIT: Two plays later I like it. Ok, it's not the greatest game on earth, and it's quite random, and maybe it's just a tad too long for what it is.

My first work placement game. Although easy to learn, it offers surprisingly high game play variety and different strategies how you could win. Great in 2, 3 and 4 players.
Great art and wooden parts, also leaden cup for dice throws is very cool. 
Also although the dice are used a lot there, the luck factor is very light and usually the better player wins.

I cannot recommend this game enough as the gateway work placement game, but I still enjoy playing this despite the 600+ games under my belt. I feel very relaxing when playing this game.

What I like:
- I simply enjoy playing this, this game makes me smile
- Great artwork, great components. It is pleasure to look at board. Even the leather cup is great (and it doesn't smell in my czech version)
- Although the dice are major part of the game, I feel that the luck never beat the strategy/tactics. Stronger player win (almost) everytime
- Several viable paths to choose, and no one is the best (although somebody says the starvation strategy is the best, but I disagree)
- Overall, classic easygoing worker placement game suited well for the game beginners but offers a great amount of strategy for gamers.

What I dislike:
- I don't know what to think about expansion, I heard some mixed feelings. Despite the fact that I am a completionist, I decided not to include this as I am afraid it could potentially ruin the clear experience from the base game
- I play this game regularly with my mum and I win all the time, which is sad sometimes - she loves the game, but she would like to win from time to time.

This worker placement game seems really easy to get started with, in the sense that learning the rules is easy.  I like the different approach used by Stone Age versus Notre Dame.  In Notre Dame, all players can generally share every location.  In Stone Age, players taking spots removes those options for the other players.  Stone Age feels more directly interactive, but Notre Dame feels like it has more options to explore.  All I can say is that I like them both.

Fun enough, but doesn't really grab me. I think I'd enjoy a similar sort of game where the infrastructure spaces were more numerous and more varied, but not so fantastically good... but balancing that out could be tricky, as either infrastructure would become mostly-useless in mid-to-late game, or its effects would have to shift as the game progressed... and either way you'd need larger tribes to take advantage of the extra spaces; between all that you've probably just tacked 30-60 minutes onto the game. And the scarcity does work well insofar as you have to roll with what's available to you, rather than always pursuing a similar strategy, so.

RATING: 6.4
I rate this lower because of how it plays with just two players.

After playing Imperial Settlers I think I may want to sell this. No wait. I give it too high of a rating so I sort of don't. My wife wants to sell it lol. And I am Jones Theorizing it due to Tzolkin and Imperial Settlers and that is a problem really as we don't Jones Theory as much.

Stone Age seems a bit too samey and controlled when played with two players.

Yet she wins a lot by playing one same strategy.

See I disbelieve it will always work.

I need to fight more for the right stuff first then eventually we will get to thin point margins based on cards and buildings maybe. 

I will keep the game hoping for that. True more players is more interesting for certain, but buddy we don't have or want that. It hangs like this for me though. It seems good enough. Then again how would I feel if I won all of the time and my strategy always worked? I would feel bored and done.

She feels like she sees through it too much and her brain and body get restless. Sure I understand. It is kind of simple. Fits the theme though. And really nice art and yeah I like this kind of theme a whole lot. Particularly when the people that see through it take their turn real quick and it becomes more of a super filler than a medium running board game.

11/9/16 Even with 4 players playing the ipad app the game  just isn't all of that good. It is too basic. I would sell it if the expansion doesn't improve it for two players. I'm done with this game. It looks pretty but I like to play real games while I am staring at pretty pictures with beautiful non guilty conscience inducing themes. Stone Age just isn't enough.

Components: Lavish. The board is beautiful, the iconography good, and having the resources be in distinct shapes is a great plus. As a vegan, I would not have purchased this game if I had realized ahead of time that it contained a leather dice cup.

Experience: It started out slow during my first few games, but that's not the case anymore. We hit the ground running, throwing everything we can at cheap resources and technology. There is a lot of math, more than in any other game I've played; players are constantly adding, dividing, and multiplying.

I find it very satisfying to gather a lot of resources. There are always fun things to do with my villagers. The variety of huts and cards makes for interesting scoring possibilities. Dice rolling is fun. Always tense. A lot of different ways to earn my points, and to react when opponent's block my preferred actions.

The conversion of villager actions to pips on a die, and resource value to points, is mostly transparent, offering a clear cost & benefits analysis in most cases (though the cards complicate things). More than half the points come from the cards, which also confer other in-game benefits, so buying cards is definitely the way to go.

A bit too competitive with four players.

Agricola-lite. Much less pressure to keep from starving. You never starve unless you are pressing your luck, or unless you choose to. As such, it is more family friendly and less brain burning. It is fun to roll the dice and use tools to change the outcome or apply more tribe members for a guaranteed payout. Great luck-of-the-dice mitigation in this game.

Worker-placement strategy game that has you converting four resources into the necessaries to score points by forming matching buildings.

Stone Age is highly intuitive to play and develops naturally.

A fun placement game that's shorter than Caylus and Pillars, but enjoyably strategic with multiple ways to win. The board is beautiful and the components are great. Other placement games force you to collect things in a certain order, but not in Stone Age, you're free to collect things in the order that you want. You're also free to choose the amount of luck in the game because you choose the number of dice. 

Stone Age is a smooth game, stripped of excess, and highly replayable. Plays great with 2.

Pretty much standard worker placement.  The value of the field space and the "family growth" spaces are obvious, and they're first picks most of the time.  The randomness of either the buildings or the cards would be fine, but the randomness of both seems a bit too much.

Mainly, however, I don't perceive that there's much tension in this game.  And unlike, say, Trajan or Ora et Labora, there's not a lot of satisfaction in continuously scoring points either. So it lies within an "unhappy" medium.

Entry-level worker placement. Played this at a public board game event with two people who would not stop talking about random off-topic stuff, completely forgetting rules which seem absurdly easy to pick up if they were paying the slightest of attention to actually playing. What could have been played in under a hour took over two, and was an absolute slog to play through.

I realise that's a problem with the people I played with. Maybe if I played with people more focused on playing with a bit of banter it would be more interesting, but I doubt it. Decision making is pitifully lacking in this game, the complete lack of player interaction is not appealing in the slightest. A good indication of what I should expect from worker placement games in general.

2-4 players, light-medium, 75-90 minutes, worker placement

Having played some 70 games, I can fairly say this is one of my favourite games.

Stone Age is a so called worker-placement game, which sets in the Stone Age. The goal of the game is to collect resources (wood, brick, stone, gold) to build huts and buy development cards which help you collect victory points. It is of course vital to feed your meeples every turn, if you cannot than you will lose 10 victory points each turn. As soon as the huts or the development cards run out, the player with the most victory points is the winner of the game.

I personally think the theme is very appealing. The board looks very nice and the resources components (all wood) are very nice as well.

Setting up the game only takes a few minutes, so you're ready to play in no time.

Stone Age plays fast and rather easy, everyone can play this within a few minutes. There is little down time and not much chance of AP. The (7) dice add some luck to the game, but in a good way as you have to use these all the time, so the luck component should even out. Also, the starting player moves per turn, so everyone gets the chance to choose first.

The routes to succes can differ, there is not one single strategy. After two games it becomes rather clear what works and what doesn't, so the advantage for an experienced player is limited to one or two games. The development cards are key to winning the game, but everyone is aware of that, so that's fine as well. On occasion, not feeding you meeples could be worthwile, when there are very strong cards or huts for grabs, but so far I've not played the game with the starvation strategy and have won probably >90% of all games I've played.

I've played a dozen games now, with 2, 3 and 4 players including a number of first timers. It plays well with any amount of players, which I consider a bonus as not many games do. Although the first game may take well over 2 hours, with experienced players you can play a game within the hour.

There is also an expansion available which allows you to play with 5 players and which adds trading goods. Personally, I prefer the original and have traded away the expansion. 

I'm a big fan and want to play this again soon! I have not found any downsides to this game yet. I rate this game 10/10!

Great family game.  Stone Age stands up as a solid game with good choices available.  It's a very good balance of fun mechanics without being overly complicated.

Replay is good with this one, and it's always a hit.  The rules are simple.  The boards look good, and have all the reference information you need.  

This has been perfect for introducing family and neighbors to the hobby.  The dice really allow you to mix players of different skill levels.  For beginners I usually leave out the civilization cards until the second play.  It makes it pretty dry for me, but that gets them excited for play #2 where it is the full game.

Adding the tension of dice rolling to a worker placement game like Caylus works really well here.  If this game was trying to be heavier than it is, then the dice would be annoying.  But as a light game, you play the odds and hope for the best.  You rejoice when the dice give you an unexpected gift (like three sixes on a dice bar when you're third in line) and you lament when the dice work against you.  A lot of fun to be had here.

Revisited after many years and much better than I remembered. The amount of luck in it, which I felt was a defect, is actually a feature: it requires calculated risks.  A careful watch on what other players are collecting, and on turn order, can lead to some interesting blocking moves since you can put a worker on spaces you can't afford. Looking forward to playing this again soon.

In Stone Age, the players live in this time, just as our ancestors did. They collect wood, break stone and wash their gold from the river. They trade freely, expand their village and so achieve new levels of civilization. With a balance of luck and planning, the players compete for food in this pre-historic time.

Combines the fun worker placement of Agricola with the rolling for resources aspect of Catan (but without quite as much randomness). I really like this game, and even though the direct player interaction is minimal, it feels like you're constantly giving people the screws by taking what they need (and vice versa). The need to feed your people is there, just like in Agricola, but it's much easier to do, and the penalty isn't as high if you can't manage it well enough.

Finally got my brother and sister in-laws to play this with me and they said they'd play it again. Hooray.

So, despite having only played it twice over a three year period, I have enough worker placement gaming under my belt to justify a rating and comment. It's as everyone says: Stone Age is one of the best examples out there as an introduction to the worker placement mechanic for those looking to play a step up from the gateway level (although Lords of Waterdeep now seems to be the more popular choice). Stone Age is relatively simple when compared to other games with the same defining mechanic, but the diversity of civilization cards and building tiles offers enough variation in strategy.

Worker placement with Dice

Pros: Building randomization also dictates a variable game length. Thematic art and good quality components. Strategic and tactical in terms of getting points through various cards or building tiles.

Cons: A lot of simple but fiddly division incorporated into dice rolls makes the game drag when players grab resources.

Great euro game.  One of my favorites - gaming group always has a good time with this one.  Great mechanics - lots to think about and do and rolling the dice is a hoot.  Yes, there's some luck, but at the end of the day your strategy will win it or lose it for you.

I'm dropping this game after a year of not playing the board game or iOS version any further. It's a good worker placement game that has a bit of luck with the resource production dice. It's just not a game that I've played since a year ago despite having ample opportunities to play it again. The strategy seems to predictable to make this a fun game to explore. Each resource spot has an ideal number of workers +/- 1, the flow of when to grab workers, resources, food and then points is also set. No matter what the other players do, sticking with the formula leads to decent results. With so many good games out there, I'm just not interested in playing this game. I think my prior high rating was more a rating of the people I was playing with instead of the game itself.

A super solid worker placement euro. This game has everything in just the right amount: strategy, luck and player interaction. Gameplay has very little player downtime and several of viable paths to victory. The theme really comes to life because of the beautiful board. I would consider this a gateway into euro gaming.

RATING: 8
Two big problems:  1)  You're crazy if you don't take a farm when you have start player.  And almost as crazy if you don't take tools when you have 2nd pick.  (There are a couple exceptions to the second part, but farms are really the must-grab).  So already you've got obvious first moves two rounds of the game.  
2)  The mechanics are very wash-rinse-repeat.  You're collecting stuff but not really building toward anything, so even at 75-90 minutes the game feels too long.  This can be easily corrected by removing cards and tiles, but problem 1) remains.
I feel like this is a pretty mediocre game rehashing old mechanics.  I'd still play it but wouldn't ask to.
ETA:  I play this online at Yucata a lot now and like it more than I used to.

RATING: 7
I like it, but I'm not really sure if I want to play it. Somehow the strategy and gameplay seem too simple and random. 

Only few viable tactics make it feel a bit simple and my thought process usually goes "if a isn't available, pick b, if b isn't available, pick c". No long thought processes like in Agricola.

With random I don't mean the dice, they're fine, but the civilization and village spots make me cry. Some cards are superior and sometimes it feels there's not much you can do with how they come up.

It's very good gateway game thought and was simple to learn! It's the longest game we've played with our casual group so far and the first time took 3 hours. Never thought they could take it but they did and everyone was "where did the time go, eek!" There's potential in my gaming group and this is the game that made me realise it!

RATING: 6.5
A good resource management/worker placement game, without the scarcity and some of the over-complexity of Agricola. Resource gathering is semi-random, but manageable enough to be interesting. The different paths to VPs make it dynamic, and you can adjust to the other players (to block or circumvent).

Stone Age is yet another place-your-worker-to-get-resources-and-special-abilities, spend-the-resources-to-get-victory-points, in the line of Caylus, Leonardo, Pillars, Agricola, kingsburg and so long and so forth.The new twist is that resources are not assigned in an exclusive way, rather players get them through dice. Additionally, workers are not returned in a predetermined order, rather on the player's choice. Stone Age is streamlined and quite simple. There is almost no structure or narrative flow in the game, and turns do not differentiate a lot among them.

Doel van het spel:

Het spel eindigt als aan het begin van een ronde de beschavingskaarten niet tot 4 kunnen worden aangevuld OF als één stapel hutten is uitgeput (huidige ronde wordt nog uitgespeeld). De speler die na de eindtelling de meeste punten heeft, wint het spel. 

In geval van gelijke stand: Huidige score + aantal gereedschap + stand op het voedselspoor + aantal stamleden. De speler met het hoogste totaal wint het spel. 

Voorbereiding:

+ Leg de voedselfiches (jachtvlakte), hout (bos), leem (leemgroeve), steen (steengroeve) en goud (rivier) op hun desbetreffende plaats. 
+ Iedere speler neemt in zijn kleur: 5 stamleden, 2 markeerstenen (veld “0” van het voedselspoor en het scorespoor), 12 voedsel en 1 spelerstableau. De jongste speler krijgt de startspelerfiguur. 
+ Sorteer de gereedschapsfiches (1/2 en 3/4) en leg ze op hun desbetreffende plaats. 
+ Schud de beschavingskaarten en leg 4 kaarten open op het speelbord 
+ Vorm een x-aantal stapels (4 bij 4SP, 3 bij 3SP en 2 bij 2SP) van 7 hutten en plaats ze op het speelbord. 

Speelverloop :

1/ Stamleden op het speelbord plaatsen 

Te beginnen met de startspeler en daarna met de klok mee, plaatst iedere speler één of meerdere stamleden op de cirkel(s) bij één locatie. Deze fase gaat door totdat alle spelers hun stamleden op het speelbord geplaatst hebben. Het is niet toegestaan om stamleden bij een locatie te zetten, waar je in een vorige beurt (in de huidige ronde) al stamleden hebt geplaatst. Je mag in deze fase niet passen. 

2/ Acties uitvoeren 

Te beginnen met de startspeler en daarna met de klok mee, voert iedere speler alle acties uit van zijn stamleden. Hij mag de volgorde van de acties willekeurig bepalen. Zijn alle acties van jouw stamleden uitgevoerd, neem ze dan terug op jouw spelerstableau. De volgende speler is nu aan de beurt.

Locatie – cirkels – actie:

Jacht – oneindig – De speler neemt voor elk stamlid op de jachtvlakte, 1 dobbelsteen. De speler telt alle geworpen ogen en mag ongebruikte gereedschapsfiches erbij optellen. De totale waarde deelt hij door 2 (naar beneden afgerond) en dat is het aantal voedsel dat de speler krijgt.

Bos – 7 – De speler deelt de totale waarde door 3 (naar beneden afgerond) en dat is het aantal hout dat de speler krijgt.

Leemgroeve – 7 – De speler deelt de totale waarde door 4 (naar beneden afgerond) en dat is het aantal leem dat de speler krijgt.

Steengroeve – 7 – De speler deelt de totale waarde door 5 (naar beneden afgerond) en dat is het aantal steen dat de speler krijgt.

Rivier – 7 – De speler deelt de totale waarde door 6 (naar beneden afgerond) en dat is het aantal goud dat de speler krijgt.

Gereedschapsmaker – 1 – De speler ontvangt 1 gereedschap. Leg of draai een fiche zodat jouw gereedschapswaarde stijgt met 1.

Beschavingskaarten – 1 per kaart – De speler neemt zijn gekozen kaart en betaalt de kosten (kader boven de kaart). Het bovenste deel van de kaart moet je direct uitvoeren (zie kaartenoverzicht).

Hutten – 1 per stapel – De speler neemt zijn gekozen hut en betaalt de grondstoffen op de hut. Verplaats je markeersteen op het scorespoor een x-aantal punten vooruit (zie hut) en leg een nieuwe hut open.

Akker – 1 – Zet jouw markeersteen op het voedselspoor 1 veld vooruit.

Bevolkingsaanwas – 2 (in 1 kleur) – plaats steeds twee stamleden  op deze plek en neem dan een extra stamlid uit de algemene voorraad. Dit stamlid mag je gebruiken in de volgende ronden.

3/ Stamleden voeden 

Iedere speler neemt eerst zoveel voedsel uit de algemene voorraad als zijn markeersteen op het voedselspoor. Daarna moet iedere speler 1 voedsel afgeven voor elke stamlid op zijn spelerstableau. Als een speler niet voldoende voedsel heeft, mag hij het ontbrekende aantal betalen met grondstoffen. Kan of wil hij het benodigde voedsel niet met grondstoffen betalen, dan verliest hij direct 10 punten (je kan niet onder de “0” komen). Ook al kiest de speler om 10 punten te verliezen, hij verliest altijd zijn resterende voedsel. 

Nieuwe ronde:

Schuif de de resterende beschavingskaarten naar rechts en vul terug aan tot 4. Spelers draaien hun gebruikte gereedschapsfiches terug naar hun beschikbare positie. Geef de startspelerfiguur door aan de volgende speler (links).

Eindtelling:

Groene achtergrond: kwadraat van het aantal verschillende symbolen + kwadraat van het aantal dezelfde symbolen.

Zandkleurige achtergrond: afhankelijk van de kaart krijg je punten:
+ aantal boeren x de stand van jouw markeersteen op het voedselspoor.
+ aantal gereedschapsmakers x de hoeveelheid gereedschap dat jij bezit.
+ aantal hutbouwers x het aantal hutten op jouw tableau.
+  aantal medicijnmannen x het aantal stamleden in jouw bezit.

Totale score = huidige score + punten van beschavingskaarten + 1 punt per eenheid grondstof.

Belangrijke regels:

+ Let op voor de aparte spelregels voor een spel met 2 à 3 spelers! Zie spelregels. 
+ Als je gebruik maakt van een gereedschapsfiche (actie jacht, bos, steengroeve, leemgroeve of rivier) dan draai je de desbetreffende fiche 90° naar rechts. Deze fiche kan je in deze ronde niet meer gebruiken. 
+ Er is geen limiet aan het aantal beschikbare grondstoffen. 
+ Als een speler de grondstoffen niet kan of wil betalen bij het kopen van beschavingskaarten of hutten, dan laat hij de kaart/hut liggen en zet hij zijn stamlid zonder gevolgen op zijn tableau. 
+ Een gereedschapsfiche moet in zijn geheel bij een dobbelsteenworp worden opgeteld. Het is niet mogelijk om een deel te bewaren voor een andere worp. Je mag meerdere fiches bij een worp optellen.

Rating after 1 play. Pretty fun and relatively short worker placement game. The dice can be aggravating, but keep you guessing.

I feel like it's missing some element to balance all players. In many games, the person who is winning has some difficulty that the lower placed players don't have. Whether this is turn order, or access to resources. As it is, once a player pulls ahead, then there is no catching up.

A typical worker placement game, such as Pillars of the Earth, Aladdin's Dragons, Leonardo DaVinci, Notre Dame...blah, blah, blah. If you like those games, you will probably like this one. I like it better than many of them, although I wish the engine-building was more diverse. It seems like you might just pick a simple strat and ride it out until the end, but I need to play it more to see if that is the case. There are random elements, but they can be mitigated by certain choices, so they are not as harsh as PotE.

Overview
---------------
Stone Age is a worker placement game in which each player acts as the leader of a small tribe. Each round, players take turns by placing at least one of their tribe members into one region of the board. However, there are two restrictions when placing a meeple:

1. You can’t place a meeple into a region which is already full.
2. You can’t place a meeple into a region into which you already placed a meeple in a previous turn of the current round.

After each player has placed all their meeples and beginning with the start player for the round, each player resolves his placements in any order they want. The regions on the board can thereby be differentiated into three categories:

1. Regions with Permanent Benefits: These regions grant you a benefit that will last until the end of the game. The following regions have a permanent benefit:
a)  Farm: After each round, you have to pay one food for each meeple in your tribe. By     placing a meeple here, you get one farm permantly. Each farm feeds one of your meeples at the end of the round.
b) Hut: Place two meeples here to get a new meeple which can be used starting next round.
c) Tool: Place a meeple here to get a new tool. Tools can be used to alter your dice rolls in resource regions.

2. Resource Regions: These regions allow you to get resources. To get them, you have to place at least one meeple into one of them. For each meeple you placed into a region, you can roll one dice. You add up all the pips on the dice you rolled to get a number of resources. You can modify your result by using the tools you got from the Tool-region (see 1c). The following resource regions are available:
a) Food: Recieve one food for each two pips you rolled.
b) Wood: Recieve one food for each three pips you rolled.
c) Brick: Recieve one food for each four pips you rolled.
d) Stone: Recieve one food for each five pips you rolled.
e) Gold: Recieve one food for each six pips you rolled.

3. Civilization regions (aka. the key to victory): The board has two regions where you can trade your resources for victory points and, to some degree, get a minor one time benefit. These regions are:
a) Civilization cards: Each round, four cards will be placed on the board randomly. They cost between one and four resources. Which resources you use to pay for them is completely up to you. First, each card grants you a small one time benefit like additional food or some resources. Second, each card has a multiplier or a symbol on it which will be resolved at the end of the game. There are multipliers for the number of farms, tools, meeples in your tribe and houses. So if  you have a tribe consisting of 7 meeples and you do have a corresponding multiplier of 3, you get 3 * 7 = 21 Victory points at the end of the game. 
The symbols are used to create sets. At the end of the game, you count how many unique symbols you managed to collect. You multiply this number with itself and the result of this operation equals the number of victory points you get. Example: For five unique symbols you collected you would get 5 * 5 = 25 Victory points.
b) Huts: Depending on the number n of players there are n hut piles. If you want to build a hut, you have to place a meeple on it and pay the cost for this hut which is printed on the card. Huts score points equal to their cost. For example a hut that cost 3 Gold gives you 3 * 6 = 18 victory points.

The game ends after the round in which one of the hut piles is depleted or you can’t place four new cards on the board. When this happens, you add up the victory points you got from multipliers, huts and symbols plus each unused resources you still own. These, with the exception of food, are worth one victory point each. The player with the most victory points wins.

Comments:
--------------
* The use of dice and the theme help to get this game to the table even if there are non-gamers present. While the dice introduce luck into the game, they hide the fact that Stone Age is a quite brutal optimization game and give it a much lighter feel. While non-gamers may not be able to see the optimal move every time and therefore aren’t that competitive, they nevertheless have a lot of fun rolling the dice and looking after their tribe. This is partly achieved by the fact, that you score most of your points at the end of the game using the cards you bought during the course of the game. So while playing Stone Age, you have to pay close attention to know who is in the lead. This is something non-gamers mostly don’t do. As a result of this, they have the feeling that they are doing okay until the game is over.

* I’m not a big fan of the end game scoring. While it helps to hide the real nature of this game from less experienced players, it also results in some disappointed looks on the face of the new players at the end of the game. When teaching this game, I ALWAYS explain the end game scoring in great detail. Nevertheless, at the end of a game new players are nearly every time surprised by the amount of victory points you can get by just buying multipliers. So the first game of a new players nearly always ends with mixed feelings.
Another drawback of the end game scoring is that it doesn’t deliver you with an immediate feedback. When learning this game, it took me a lot of plays to see which actions are actually the best ones in certain situations. In order to judge the value of a placement, you have to do quite a lot of math in your head. But it took me quite some time to reach this point. The online implementation of Stone Age at www.yucata.de was very helpful during this process as it shows you your current score in great detail, giving you an immediate feedback.
So, all in all the end game scoring is a mixed bag for me. On the one hand it helps getting this game to the table, on the other hand it makes it so much more difficult to learn the strategy.

* I like the dice in Stone Age. Sure, sometimes they can ruin your plans. But on the other hand, they prevent the game from becoming a pure math exercise. Additionally I really enjoy the risk management aspect that is introduced by them.

* Stone Age puts constant pressure on you. As in every worker placement game, you are faced with a dilemma each time you have to place your meeples. Do I claim this region now or later? Will someone else have used it by then? I do really enjoy the tension that comes with this kind of decisions.

Excellent worker-placement, with enough going on that you can feel like you're developing a strategy and making real decisions, even though an inordinate amount of the longish running time goes to dice rolls.  There's a reasonable amount of interaction going on just based on locking people out of spots you want to place your meeples, though I think it could maybe have a LITTLE more back-and-forth stuff in the mechanics.

The art's attractive, but I wish the board design gave more room (or even just organization) to handle all the bits that start to pile up everywhere, especially on your own tableau.  Feels messy and the fear of some bricks knocking someone out of their score track position is palpable.  But these are small gripes.

Solid older euro. Gamers will nail the optimal strategy in three or four plays, at which point it comes down to who rolls higher dice. It's still fun though, and good for teaching kids multiplication tables.

EDIT: I think I'm gaining an appreciation for games that don't grind to a halt on the altar of their own complexity. Plenty of tough prioritizing in the worker placements, but none that can't be made with a shrug of the shoulders and a toss of the dice.

The only knock on this game is that there is no 'building strategy'. You have to prioritize cards and fill in with buildings where possible. If you're playing with first-timers, this should be explained with the rules to avoid an unsatisfying experience.

This is probably one my favorite worker placement game I've played.
The components are pretty standard - not too flashy, but well made.  The game moves along pretty well, and there's always something to do. Not a lot of player interaction beyond your choices interfereing with other player's strategy.  I was a bit put off by the theme - prehistoric games usually don't do it for me - but this wasn't too bad. The mechanics and the theme seemed to go well with each other.  I just wish that designers would make these games for more people.  4 just usually isn't enough for our game group.  Which is too bad, because the four of us who played this for the first time really enjoyed it.
OK, this has fallen into the same category for me as Age of Empires 3.  I can't seem to win at either game, although I like Stone Age better.

RATING: 6
Disappointing.  Collecting victory points by taking cards and rolling dice.  Yes, the game engine works and it is a reasonably interesting game, but it is much, much too long for what it has to offer, especially since all the turns are essentially alike.  Also, what is the point of all the different resources if all of them are practically the same.  It looks pretty though - I suspect this is the main reason that it is so overrated here on BGG.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
This is by far my favorite new game of the ones I tried at the Gathering.  It is thematically clear, which makes it easy to learn, and it has very interesting game play.  The dice play a pretty big role in the outcome of each game, but I think this is sufficiently counterbalanced by the importance of playing efficiently.  I feel pretty sure Stone Age will become a favorite medium weight game and also find a niche as a family game.  It is my current pick for this year's Spiel Des Jahres, which would be a nice step up in complexity.  I will write a review for as soon as I have find some time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Very enjoyable worker placement set collection type game - with a wonderful board (art). Could easily straddle the family game/gamers game divide.

It should also be noted that I am not a big fan of worker placement, especially when where you can place is restricted by who goes first, nor does set-collection ever do a great deal for me and Stone Age exhibits both as central mechanics - yet I still like the game, probably as it's nicely streamlined and non-fiddly and plays in a short playing time.  

The iOS version is very good.

A worker placement game that distinguishes itself because of the amount of luck that it has.  When you place a worker, you roll dice to see how many resources you collect.  It makes for an interesting twist that I enjoyed.

Played many times now.  Not sure how much variability the game has, but it is still fun to play.  Holding steady at 7.

RATING: 6
I admit that I bought Stone Age in anticipation of Agricola. I was so enthusiastic about the impending arrival of the well-heralded worker placement game that I bought another worker placement game to prepare myself. Luckily, Stone Age failed to disappoint me. While being lighter than Agricola, it still moved along briskly, provided a number of fun and interesting decisions, and overall proved to be a good game. It was no Agricola, however, and as soon as I bought Agricola I ceased to be interested in playing Stone Age. 

That changed recently, as I introduced the game to my mom, and decided that this would be an excellent game to play with her and my sister. My mom isn't hugely interested in the game (she likes Blokus and Zing! better), but my sister likes it quite a bit, so I play it with her and Becky, when we visit each other. I suspect that this will be the main instance in which I play this game in the future, as I am more likely to bring out something a bit heavier with my "gamer" friends.

Players try to work their tribe of stone age cave peoples, and gain victory points.  Another game where pawns are placed, resources gathered, and ultimately traded for victory points.  Almost entirely lifted from other games we've seen in the past three years.  The good thing is it all works, is made in Europe (quality bits), and looks stunning.  The bad thing is it's entirely unoriginal, takes too long, and feels like too much of the same thing.  Happy to play it, but feels like a quick knock off of other similar games.

This is one of my wife's favorite game. The theme is engaging, and the board is just fun to look at. I like the push your luck aspect of the worker placement/dice rolling combo. This is definitely the most well balanced game I own, and I like how the players control the game length with their choices. Although you are competing for worker spots, I don't feel much tension when playing this game. That's only a slight negative to me (and a positive for my wife). Once you have the basic strategies figured out, victory is based more on luck than skill, but that doesn't bother me (for this game) because it's just plain fun to play.

Trying to decide how I feel about Stone Age. It's fine for an intro to Euros, or a quick, light game, but there are a couple things I don't like much:
- It's impossible to plan for good multipliers or civ tech cards, unless there's a very strong opening draw.
- The game doesn't feel like it has much of a "story arc", as it's kinda flat throughout the game, and many of the choices are only marginally better than the others.

RATING: 7
A game that will potentially rise in my opinion after repeated plays.  I played it once and underestimated the importance of key scoring mechanics until halfway through the game.  

This game is neat!  Sort of Agricola with dice and really high scores!  You have tribe members, they get resources, reproduce, build farms, build buildings, get upgrades, you need to feed them...  Anyways, it reminds me a lot of Agricola, but it's much easier in this game to see how one is supposed to get points, and easier to get points in general.  It's a fun one!

Decent worker-placement game that falls somewhere between Pillars (bad) and Agricola (good) for me.  Tons of dice rolling, which is fine by me, but maybe a tad repetitive.

I'm liking this game more and more. It's amazing how balanced it is. I love how everything scores VP's and that their return in VP is quite obvious. I think this is due to the fact that everything is based off of the same point structure (i.e. Wood is worth 3, so a hut with 3 woods on it is worth 9. So simple. )

RATING: 7
A solid worker-placement dice game.  This was overplayed for a long while, but seems to have subsided a bit.  
It has an interesting flow.  The game might go long, and investment in cards may be key.  Or someone might grab resources and drill a stack of huts, preventing the cards from reaching their potential.  Of course, a lot of it is dependent on the die rolls, and consistently rolling high can put you ahead of the curve.  Those who feel that the luckless Caylus is the pinnacle of worker placement may hate this twist, but I don't mind it.  
The way the cards & huts come out gives the game enough variation that I can forgive the somewhat scripted start.  

Only thing I'm not sure about is the whole 'starvation strategy'.  I've yet to get an answer I'm satisfied with as to whether that's intentional or not, and whether the 10 pt penalty is flat, or per person.  I've only played a couple games where someone tried it, but it seems powerful enough that the only person who has a chance of stopping the starving player is the one to his/her left, who's snapping up all the food/agriculture they don't take.

I love worker placement games, and most involve very little luck. Until now I thought that was a good thing.  This game is a perfect blend of luck and skill, which elicits a much more emotional response than most worker placement games.  Taking calculated risks provide a strategic element that can bump you ahead or blow up in your face.  The game provides you some risk mitigation with tools, which helps you deal with unlucky rolls and keeps the balance of luck to skill in check.  The only downside is it feels like collecting culture cards just destroys any other strategy.

Comment: Played my first two-player Stone Age last month. I know it's good with two (people have been saying this) but if you're okay with luck, then I guess this will be fine for you.

When happened in my game was that, the actions seems a little scripted in my opinion, especially in the village. Also, me and my opponent kept fighting for civ cards (which is a good thing)(either blocking or buying), and whenever he becomes the first player, some pretty decent cards appeared on the first two spots (like the field/green background cards or the the double/triple multiplier). He got to buy them cheap while I have to struggle a little and hoping the good ones also come out during my turn.

I know the cards are drawn randomly but it can happen that luck is not on your side.
So I'd say I prefer Stone Age with four players and not two.

RATING: 7
This one has slipped from an 8 in my book.  The first plays are fun, but after that it feels like the game loses complexity.  The basic strategy becomes get wood to buy cards and forget everything else.  To compensate, we've tried mixing up the buying requirements for the cards (need a gold and wood for example).  It seems to work out alright, but still tweaking it.

I'm okay, Caylus is way better than this game. Howeverm Stone Age is a perfect "Caylus"-like game for family: the theme is better, the game is way more simple and is still interesting.

RATING: 4
Fair.  A solid game, although not as accessible to non-gamers as I initially thought.  Worker placement, as a mechanic, is conceptually really weird to non-gamers.  I actually think it is more accessible in Caylus (although the rest of the game is not) due to the latter's clear and sensible one-worker-per-space rule.

Once they get over the hump in this, it's okay.  Good playing time and beautiful art make for a nice experience, but something's still lacking -- probably in the huts, which are a phenomenally bland, unthematic, and transparent way to do the whole "turn stuff into points" thing that so many Euro designers are into.  If the game had ditched the huts entirely and just focused on civ cards, it probably would have turned out better.

Diet coke with ice. No. Diet Pillars of the Earth with dice. Steals from everywhere, but that's OK. Played it online a lot, starving strategy works too well to my taste, but doesn't break the game. Think this has broad appeal.

Stone Age simplifies and condenses the mechanics of Pillars of the Earth into a game that teaches easier and plays cleaner. And it holds your attention until the end with hidden victory points via the taken cards placed face-down. Lots of ways to play it and lots of workable strategies. Plays very nicely with two, three or four, and we've had several 1- and 2-point score differences. Doesn't hurt that the wife likes it enough to request playing.

average game... has good and bad points. it is a dice game... so those that get to emotional about the outcome of some *key* die rolls will likely want to avoid this game, but otherwise a decent resource management game. one of a long line of resource management games. no need to own for me though.initial rating is 6.5 (more likely to go up then down... variation of play style would allow an increase.)

This is a light-medium weight worker placement game.  You play as a prehistoric tribe and utilize your tribe members to gather resources, construct huts, farm, make tools, or procreate.  The person who develops their tribe the most through huts and civilization cards wins.

The game does utilize die rolls for resource gathering so there is definitely a good dose of luck involved.  But I feel the game offers a fair amount of ways to mitigate luck.  The game rules are pretty straightforward and easy to teach.  Scoring with the civilization cards is the only part that may be a little confusing, but one play-through is all you need to understand it.  In addition, the game board is beautiful and I love the fact that they use thematically shaped pieces for the resources instead of just having different colored cubes.

I consider this my go-to gateway worker placement Eurogame to introduce people to the genre.  So far it has been pretty successful.  Highly recommended!

This is fun game and a lot of dice usage when you are collecting your resources. It is quite light and a good gate way game. Feeding your family in this game is not as hard as other games, such as Agricola, and so you don't seem to have to panic. The harvest is not the only thing it shares with Agricola, you also have to place workers. The components are lovely and the game comes with a really nice dice cup.

RATING: 7.5
Stone Age is like worker placement 101, an excellent intro to the mechanic but ultimately not as exciting or fulfilling as the Agricola's and Le Havre's of the gaming world.  However, with the right crowd it can be good fun and the mystery scoring of the cards at the end means everyone feels they have a chance right to the last.

I would consider this a 'beginner' worker placement game and an excellent gateway to games like Agricola.  Most likely, this game will be a big hit when the kids get older.  For the time being, I will enjoy having the game board framed and hanging on our wall.

This is my go to gateway game. Great theme and components, with an expansion that adds just enough to mix things up long term. Beginners can have a blast within a few turns, but an experienced player will wipe the floor every time.

UPDATE: Thinking more about Stone Age -- it's one of those games that really seems to focus on One Novel Mechanic but once you take that out it leaves you with a pretty uninspiring game.

I liked it okay, but I didn't really feel a need for it in my game library because how many worker placement games do you really need? The dice made it a little different but still not worth keeping. I'd play it again if someone else had it though.

This is an excellent introductory worker placement game.  There are a lot of random aspects to the game, such as cards, order of the building tiles, and lots of dice rolling but for some reason I'm not bothered by the randomness in this game.  It's a pretty quick game, the rules aren't overly complicated, there are many paths to victory and the components/art/theme are amazing.  Of all the euro's that use dice in an interesting way, I think this beats Yspahan and Kingsburg.  Try it online through BSW if you're still on the fence about this one. Eventually was replaced by Troyes.

This is the game that got me hooked on strategy board games. I had already played games like Settlers of Catan and Dominion, which are fun, but Stone Age is what really led me to discover the wonderful world of strategy board games. It has a great balance of strategy and luck (too much luck for some people because of the number of dice you roll), and it is easy to explain so it's a great game to bring to the table for people who aren't as familiar with strategy board games. Interestingly, if I go too long without playing Stone Age I find myself really craving to play!

Played final prototype at Hans im Glueck game evening before actual publication. Solid competition game with interaction through competition. Unusually for Hans im Glueck it uses dice as a statistical mean, but this works ok and doesn't distract from the game which is essentially a resource management game where one can try out various very different strategis. It seems that these strategies have to be very doggedly followed to have some effect, there is little fluctuation once you decide what you want to strive for, but the easy game flow and nice theme make up for this slight critique.

This is a classic game with clean mechanics that are approachable to many and interesting enough to satisfy the gamer types. The game can get a bit samey over the years and those gamer types may get tired of teaching it as the "gateway" dice game. If only huts added some additional game play effect, I would REALLY love this game, instead all the "prizes" the huts and cards are just different slices of victory points.

Excellent art, map and components, however I felt the resource counters to be a little overproduced.  However I was really impressed that this is such an easy game to grasp, appearing simple, yet has some very tough decision choices to be made on strategy.  It plays well at all player counts, however I was not entirely keen on all Stone Age's dice rolls (with other worker placement games, I'm amazed how they created a gripping product without requiring dice).  However in spite of that, Stone Age is definitely a game everyone should try twice if they like w/p games.

Edit:  To an 8.  I still like this quite a bit, but I had to knock it down a notch due to the dice rolling.  Sometimes, you just roll 6 1's and it really sucks and you're out of the game.  It's rare, but it does happen.

Back up to 9, because I'm always in the mood to play it despite the dice rolling.

Mildly interesting worker placement game with multiple paths to victory.  For me, fails to evoke the theme.  A bit fiddly and with significant down time.  Luck may play too large a part to satisfy some players.  Overall, overstays its welcome by about 30 minutes if your game takes the 90 minute interval stated on the box.  In this niche, I prefer Saint Petersburg (http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9217/saint-petersburg), which plays faster, is less luck dependent and has art that I find more pleasing.

Upgraded the rating to a 10 (from 9).  The more I play it the more I like it.  Insane replayability.  I've been playing it over Dominion online, even great 2 players.

For a dice game this has suprising depth.  The dice tend to average out in the long run, every once in a while making or breaking turns, means you can't totally rely on your plans coming through.

I've played this game a couple dozen times, and it is still interesting.  It is light and fun, but still engaging enough to keep people interesting.  

It has taken the place of Settlers for my default dice introductory game.

RATING: 7
Stone Age looks pretty basic, and to a certain extent it is, but I enjoy playing when I'm in the right mood. The self-tailored end game scoring associated with the civilization cards is brilliant and helps create strategies for players to pursue. The 'town' actions are too scarce and tend to create scripted moves during the beginning of a new round. Overall, there isn't enough complexity for me to invest much table time, but it is a satisfying every now and again.

I was reasonably satisfied with this game. I don't think the worker placement genre benefits from the addition of dice randomization though.  

After a few more plays I would suggest you do not look at the dice as a randomizer, but as a risk managment affair. Hopefully you are rarely putting yourself in situations where you need a certain roll to turn out one way or another. Hopefully you are taking risks on speculations that will help you acquire more resources as the game goes on.

Very pretty and semi-complex, balanced game that one can learn and understand on their first play. It almost feels like a lighter version of Agricola. I like that it gets more tense each round (although some moves seem pretty obvious and predefined), and that there are different ways and strategies to collect victory points. At first sight I thought the dice rolling would bother me, but that isn't the case - the dice rolling plays just a small part in the whole puzzle.

A typical theme-less Euro but reasonably fun. I like the uncertainty of resource production and trying to find the right equilibrium between having more workers and having enough food. The game also moves along at a good pace - not too much AP for a worker-placement game. 

However, several things detract from the enjoyment of the game. 1) Too long with four players. The 60-minute time stated in the BGG entry is clearly not meant for a 4-player game. 2) Players must have a reasonable idea of the importance of what's being collected or a runaway leader will develop.

I've only been able to play this one a few times, but I really enjoyed those few times. It's a great intro to worker placement games.

That could be a good thing since sometimes LoW can seem too simple in it's decisions.

A VERY FUN prehistoric-themed game with a combination of several mechanics:

A very cutthroat worker-placement, because the food track and tool are very useful. A set-collection mechanic from the civ cards. And building game where each building gives a certain amount of VPs.

Played it twice now, and it's still very interesting to play again. Comes with a leather-prehistoric looking-dice shaker. Very fun but still tactical and strategic. I can't believe I can enjoy playing dice like in this game because I usually don't really like 6d dices..

This game hits a sweet spot for me. I really like how the dice rolling mechanic works to get resources of different values. Also, I feel like unlucky rolls are mitigated over time by smart meeple placement and developing tools. The blocking tactic is here as in most worker placement game but it doesn't feel too harsh here; I usually feel like there are other good sites to place my meeples that will give me an advantage on future turns. The components are gorgeous. The game scales very well from 2 to 4 players. I guess my only small negative is the down time. There is nothing for you to do while other players are carrying out their actions. But the game is good enough to make up for that, definitely! 

Style is the Goal expansion included. What a stupid name.

Man oh man, do I hate worker placement games.  I'm trying to figure out why, beyond the obvious truth that I utterly suck at them.  I think of a game like In The Shadow of the Emperor, which I like a lot, and think 'well that has limited action options too'.  But then again, those actions have been priced by their inherent value, while in Stone Age, action selection seems to be very subject to simply who is seated first when the best thing is clear.

This type of game is certainly thematically suspect.  Am I to believe that there was only a single copulation hut in the pre-metallurgic era?  Seems inconvenient.  Am I to believe that Stone Age denizens chopped wood and mined gold so that they could collect series' of pictures?

Great worker placement game, not as heavy as Agricola.  Count on up to 30 minutes per player. The artwork on the board is fantastic (reminds me of Pillars)!  The theme is more appealing than I initially thought - it's basically a hunter/gather type community.  It is a typical euro game in many respects (think: St Petersburg, Notre Dame, Pillars of the Earth, Age of Empires III - meeple placement, resources, victory points, buildings, short term and long term rewards), but it does have some unique elements, and the components are fantastic - I'd have to regard it as one of the better and more enjoyable ones out there.  Many say that the gameplay and mechanics are most similar to Pillars of the Earth and Agricola, as discussed [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/322197]here[/url] and [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/313367]here[/url], but it has the advantage of being accessible enough to be played with non-gamers.  Replayability could also prove to be an issue, because in the early games players are likely to compete for the same placements?  
Two player game works very well (you can block what your opponent is aiming for), although going for food production & extra people seems like an essential strategy to win.

I honestly don't know what all the hoopla is about with this game.  It is a simple worker placement game that draws liberally (and blatantly) from previous games like Pillars of the Earth and Caylus.  I would much rather play Pillars, which has more going on without the brain-burning of Caylus.  There is nothing wrong with Stone Age, but it sure doesn't feel like a top 100 game to me.

The board is beautiful and the components are great, but it just seems like its a way longer game than it needs to be. Also, it seemed like the balance of cards/huts was somewhat questionable.

Not bad, lots of options/decisions and stuff going on, but likely no long term appeal for me due to dice.

This is a good lightweight worker placement game that marries light strategy, worker placement, interaction, and dice. The interaction is great in how you can take things from people, even take a spot that you don't intend to activate (unlike its contemporary Kingsburg); this facet provides tension. 

The strategy of the game is not very deep, though. You simply pick a VP ladder and climb the heck out of it while rolling well (you hope). The resources are practically the same resource, just a different grade of it. I’ve played a couple dozen games of it on table and online (where most of my plays were actually). 

I enjoyed my plays of Stone Age and could play online as a diversion, but for a dice strategy game, we now enjoy Troyes.

Yo dawg, I hear you like set collection
so I put set collection in your set collection so you could set collect while you set collect.

Everything in this game is about matching your sets.  Buying those boat advancements give you additional victory points at the end of the game.  Sometimes those come from the number of workers you have.  Sometimes, they're from your tools.  Maybe you're going to collect technology this time?  Who knows!

Beyond the set collection, the resource management is incredibly flat and fair.  Gold is worth 6vp, because you need 6s to get it.  In that sense, it's always a better choice to take cheap wood than expensive gold.  However, the civ cards need gold, so you'll have to get some of that too.

Great trade-offs and balanced game play.  If someone suggested Lords of Waterdeep, I'd ask for this instead.

Gaming: This game is like a simpler Agricola. Agricola requires too much time to explain to new players, and then to actually play. I like how the dice add just a touch of luck... but not too much. It's slowing down in our house, but still can come out if need be.

This game is the reason I haven't had a need to purchase a lot of other euro games in the past several years.  It's a great worker placement game and the expansion only enhances the experience without overcomplicating the game.  This is a great second level game to get newer gamers introduced to.  Tons of deeper strategy once you get into it, but simple enough to get the basics and start playing quickly.  I was sad to see my smelly cup finally kick the bucket this year (2017) - started growing mold.  Still as smelly as the day I opened the box.

It was fun, and there are various routes you can take, but it's another use-meeples-to-get-resource-to-trade-in-for-VPs type game. Not bad in itself, but it's treading a well worn path. You have to keep your meeples fed, which worked well enough, but the combinations of choices to get VPs became a little boring over the game. No interaction except for taking a position before the player after you gets it, and there's a lot of dice rolling which does introduce a significant elemnet of luck. Not chance, luck; lucky rolls get you a lot of food or resources, which you can then cash in on your next turns, freeing your meeples up to do other owrk of national impostance. Bad dice rolls mean you have to send them back to do it again, and your game subsists instead of growing. But it was fun. I'll play it again but I may mark it down, to 5 even, if the dice luck is too important.

Yet another "worker placement" game.  It features a fun dice mechanic that's not overly luck dependent.  The score ranges are CRAZY!  First place can be in the 300's while 2nd place in the mid 100's.  This is due to the multiplier score bonuses from the cards you get.  The cost of these cards reduce in the next round as previously unwanted cards are shifted to the side.  The feel of the game isn't much different than others, but I think the game stands strong on its own because of the clever scoring method and the neat dice implementation. Grade: B

Haven't cracked it yet but am really looking forward to it.

Edit:  Brought it out and played three times:  3-player, then 4-player, then 2-player.  This was with casual gamer friends who had never played a worker placement game.  The explanation overwhelmed them but within a couple rounds they picked it up no problem.  Really good game that scales well.  Not too dice dependent, plenty of strategy, very fun.  The die cup does reek of chemicals though and is unusable.

OCT 2017: 11 plays plays listed here, and I haven't played for more than 5 years! This game has aged well, I think. In fact, my rating has jumped back up a bit. There is just enough tension the various parts of the game to make it a fun game if played at a good clip.

2009: Played 10 times, with 2-4 players. Like it a TON more than Pillars of the Earth - which it is very similar to - because the things that you acquire in Stone Age can be used in more ways than the things you acquire in Pillars. If Stone Age is replayable, I will bump it to a 9. My only concern is the repetitveness. The "lather, rinse, repeat" remark is spot on, so the question is, do you like doing what you do in this game enough for that not to bother you? Ticket to Ride falls into that camp for me: same couple of actions over and over and over, but you have to play a bit of defense, and work hard to keep your options open and have a variety of different big ways to accumulate points. If Stone Age has those qualities, it is a solid 9, if not a 10. I have a feeling it IS going to be that good. I'll update when I get 5 more plays in. /EDIT/ It's a 9 now. So many strategies can work, and that was my main concern. /EDIT/ Nope. Too repetitive. Ratings History: 8889998777 (Bday. Sold.)

Quality board game.  Wooden pieces in different shapes instead of cubes painted different colors.  Leather dice cup.  Gorgeous graphics.  And the game plays well with numerous ways to score.  Learning curve is easy and rules are few and well written.  In fact, the board leads you through your turn so that referral to rules was minimal.  Looking forward to more plays.  Several avenues to winning.  The more I play it, the more I like it.

First impressions are good - lots of actions to take and you never get stuck for a resource if you really need it.   A lot of dice rolling.  Requirement to keep producing food was a bit of a drag but there is an opt out alternative to lose VPs instead.   Game I would like to play again.

A brilliant re-hashing of familiar game mechanics which works perfectly.  The game features many ways to advance your position but each player should keep an eye on who's picking up what in the cards.  End game bonus counts can skew the scores wildly.  A measure of your success can be gauged on how much effort is spent in hoarding food; if you're always forced to send lots of meeples to the food store, you're doing something wrong.  Great fun.

RATING: 6.75
For the most part this is a solid game, and with the right people in the right environment I enjoy it. There are several game design decisions that are a major drawback for me, though. The randomness (die rolling) for just a few things seems a little out of place when most things are not random. The outcome of some cards/card types is overly determined by the order players are sitting around the board. And finally there's a major, in my opinion, flaw in how feeding (or specifically, not feeding) works. The penalty (or, as explained by the designer, the trade) for not having sufficient food in your supply (or resources, should you chose to convert them to food) is 10 points, regardless of if you fail to feed one person or ten. While strictly considering this rule's impact on the game it may be fine (ie, it's a strategy that is within the bounds of the rules, and there are strategies to combat it), to me it just doesn't make any sense and further ruins a game that already had a few minor strikes.

RATING: 6
The game, for a light game with some good strategy, is excellent overall.  It's fun rolling the dice and they add ups and downs to deal with, but there are enough dice rolls that the luck evens out by the end.  My only problem is that while there are enough decent strategies to choose from at any one point in time, none of them ever seem to end up being the wrong choice.  It's like after you've played a few times, you can't really mess up.  The one exception being when people rush the buildings.  Then you better be building yourself or you'll have a problem.  Games are usually decided by a narrow margin in my experience but you never even know the game is that close because there's usually a lot of multipliers out there worth a ton of points.

I really prefer this game with 2-3 people. 

Playing 4 player, I fell a little out of love with it. Seemed more tedious than fun waiting for people to finish resolving their turns. 

It's a good gateway, and I love the economic aspect of this game. I've got lots of friends who really love this, but for newbie gamers, I always seem to want it to be better/more interesting/exciting than it is and am always afraid that I've bored their pants off. Waiting for people to resolve their turns can get a bit tiring. 

I do, however, really love this game for 2 and fills the 2nd tier gateway niche really perfectly. I think it's a must have.

Buen juego de iniciación con una complejidad apenas mayor que la del Catán. Se juega rápido, tiene sus estrategias y los componentes son chulísimos.

I like this game. I thought it was similar to Agricola and focused too much on food. It does have a weakness though. If you focus on resources rather than getting food for your people, you can still win. This is a problem with the game.

Another worker placement game, which I love.  Beautiful artwork and components invite one to play.

Perhaps a little too much repetition in the dice rolling for resources mechanism.  This of course introduces a little more luck into the game.

Game can be a little long.  Overall this is a great game and most definately a keeper for me.

Great components and artwork. I have only played a modified version with my son. We skip the hunting/feeding/agriculture and leave out a few of the buildings in each pile. This dramatically decreases the play time and makes it somewhat less difficult. Has been great to develop mental math skills for him.

Its an alright game. I like it so far. Dice are an interesting addition to what is other wise a very euro feeling game. The theme is weak in a lot ways, so don't look to closely... If played as a light hearted game its fun but I wouldn't recommend it for the serious gamer.  

EDIT: This game requires lots of basic math which feels almost counter to how light the rest  of the game is.

This game is similar to Pillars of the Earth to me but is more enjoyable.  With the dice roll aspect distributing extra people into the same area seems intuitive.

This feels a bit like a lightweight version of "Pillars of the Earth". Gameplay is slightly boring; there's not too much options on what to do on your turn. Most of the time, there's one pretty obvious "right" thing to do, and you do it, which feels like being a "player automaton" or "meeple placing / resource taking"-machine. 

It's fast to learn, though, and relaxing.

RATING: 7
Nothing revolutionnary in this game. The luck factor keeps it from being "solved", but it also turns it into a somewhat simplistic game. It's another one of these games where every road is equally worthwile, as long as you stick to your plan. All in all, an interesting way to spend an hour.

On the downside, I'm not a fan of the division-and-rounding that you keep on doing in this one.

RATING: 9.01
After 20 games of Stone Age (2/3 of which were played with the expansion), I'm ready to say: Great Game! I reviewed it in detail here:

http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/851956/stone-age-expansion-my-first-worker-placement-gam

But to summarize:

Stone Age is a worker placement game that perfectly satisfies our family's love of light-to-medium gateway games like Settlers of Catan and Ticket to Ride. It manages to achieve a healthy balance between luck and skill, presents several interesting choices per turn, and is very re-playable thanks to the different hut/card ordering each game. It also has less screwage than most other gateway games (especially with the expansion), which especially suits my wife's temperament. And most victory points are hidden all game which means you'll happily play your game in ignorant bliss as you achieve your mini goals and build up your economic engine, not really knowing for sure if you're winning or losing.

It's the combination of all of these elements that makes this a great gateway game.

It veers towards medium on the light-to-medium complexity scale. And that means it's a little more complicated and a little longer and a little more math oriented than other popular gateway games, and worst of all it has more down time. But that's more than made up for by frequent interesting choices, less screwage and not knowing how badly you're losing, all of which is even more true with the expansion.

In other words, this game is fun to play, even when you lose.

The strategies aren't necessarily deep (it really is just converting dice rolls into points), and the random revealing (or lack thereof) of civilization cards can make you feel cheated at times, but this game provides for an overall great experience.

Many people seem to think Stone Age is a dice game. It's not. While it's impossible to win the game without using any dice at all there are various other factors that have a lot more influence on winning or losing than the dice (event cards, for one). Stone Age allows different strategies, and in most cases the amount of luck that is there can be reduced by other means. It's somewhat hard to explain to non-gamers in part due to the different strategies, but the rules are pretty simple and easily understood by more experienced players. Most newbies like it, too, once they get the hang of it.

PRO - Great game and great components.  More straightforward than Pillars of the Earth and scales very well.  Builds well.

CON - Nothing really to note.  Does eventually seem to boil down to a race for the hut cards. Also, the box doesn't close well because of the dice cup, but the dice cup was such a nice touch I can't really complain.

Stone Age is a worker placement game ala Agricola that gets a lot of mileage out of it's theme.  The core gameplay is a lot of fun - everyone takes turn placing their workers to choose from the same pool of options, all in the hopes of developing the nicest caveman village - and the production values are top notch.  Plus, my group starts acting like we're playing Og, the caveman RPG, which adds to the flavor.  I can't explain why the huts are referred to locally as "housen", however, I just can't.

Tremendously overrated.  Not bad, but not 7.5 either.  Game runs long for what it is, is very repititious, the connection to theme is beyond laughable (gold-plated huts?) and the endgame scoring from civs is too heavy given the rest of the game.

I like the bits, and it's not a *bad* game, but it's just another 'place your people, this is our only form of interaction' type game in a long congo line full of them.


EDIT:  Got Agricola in trade.  If I don't enjoy that, there's no hope for me liking worker placement games.  As for this?  Traded away.

Stone Age is a very solid dice game with your regular Euro mechanics. An easier-going worker placement game but one that offers a lot of fun and tense decision making. I really enjoy the level of risk involved and turns go by pretty quickly. Also, no move ever seems like a bad one but there are always better moves! The cards are what offers that dose of variety in a very straight-forward system.  And I love the smell of the dice cup!

Stone Age changed my opinion on the new crop of worker placement games.  Before Stone Age I had my fill with Caylus, AoE III, etc.  They either failed to excite, or they just were laborious to a point of exhaustion and never quite provided the rewards in respect to the work involved.  I had also found the systems in place to be rather clunky, and the designs a little unpolished.  Well then came Stone Age, after a good while of avoiding such games, and to my surprise I adored it.  The design was clean, and the play was smooth.  The randomizers (dice, card/building distribution) added replay ability to the game rather than providing the feeling of something off, and unbalanced to the point of breaking it in any ones favor (AoE III).  It is in no means a heavy game, nor is it a complete wash in terms of decision making.  It in fact reaches a nice balance between weight and length, and could even be offered up as a gateway while providing a good challenge for seasoned gamers.  
The production values are amazing, and leave one wondering why the price point is lower than most of it's brethren that have lesser components.  All in all, Stone Age is a strong addition to the worker placement genre and has enjoyed numerous plays, with many more to come.

UPDATE:  with the arrival of Agricola, and plays of both Cuba and Pillars -  Stone Age has lost a little of it's shine, but I still find it to be a solid, and fun design.  In many ways I think this could be a replacement for Settlers in turning people on to modern Euros.

A nice alternative to Pillars.  The randomness of the dice works really well, and should make the game less predictable (which Pillars can become).  I really like how the game scales with different numbers of players, and how your strategy must change as well.

I don't like the starvation rule though, and am going to exploit that my next game to see how bad it really is.

The resource scheme seems silly, since they all convert at the same ratio to vp.  The only difference is the inefficiency of the dice rolls.  There are enough wild huts and they cycle fast enough that I saw no difficulty in converting resources except perhaps on the last turn.  At that point it will come down to luck on what huts come up.

Not a bad game, played several times through boardgamearena.com and while not a bad game, it doesn't do as much for me as Lords of Waterdeep insofar as a lightweight worker placement game is concerned. In all my games, I've gone heavily into Agriculture advancement and never having to spend workers on food production helps a lot. Not a bad experience, but I'm not in any rush to get it, I think it has (arguably) smoother gameplay than Lords of Waterdeep, but fewer meaningful decisions to make.

I'm not afraid of dice.  In fact, I rather like the risk management aspect of the game.  Layer on top the worker placement mechanism, it think there are some interesting decisions, though my mind tends to run on autopilot these days based off some rules of thumb I calculated.  Still, I think it has enough heft and fun for a 60 minute game.

A classic. One of the best gateway worker placement games out there, period. There's so much competition in this type of game, but the theme shines through, the mechanics make sense, and it's easy to explain to anybody. Not to mention, the board is beautiful, and the parts integrate well also (even the 'skin cup'- which has a slightly odd odor...)

I enjoy Stone Age a lot.  It was one of the first games that I got after I got introduced to the hobby, and I still enjoy playing it.  The game is easy to explain to new players.  It also has enough strategic decisions to keep it interesting.  The board is gorgeous, which is a huge selling point for me.  Games are simply better when they look really good.
The dice cup smells horrific though... we had to throw it out.
If you don't have any worker placement games, this is a pretty good place to start.

Light placement game (similar to Pillars, Caylus, etc.) with dice rolling for resources.  Not nearly as much tension as say Caylus, but enough that there are still strategic choices.

Good thematic worker placement. But unfortunately also a little bit luck based. If the super-duper cards are revealed and you are the last one this round to place your worker... Or if you have bad luck in rolling dice. Or revealing the building tiles...

Decent enough, the struggle for survival in The Land of the Lost Resources, but the decisiveness of the dice combined with a brutal seat order effect mean this one can only be enjoyed as light fun and not serious strategy. A shame the garish, clashing colors of the meeples are a jarring blight on the organic and earthy board.

Prefer 2-player, as it offers more avenues for competitiveness and screwage.

Enjoyable game.  Its roots in Keydom and Pillars of Earth show though, but the dice mechanic and Civilisation/buildings VP gathering brings freshness.

Easy to play and teach. The board looks great. It's a nice game to teach people about "building" euros (Like Agricola.) It never seems as tense as Agricola though. The card scoring rules are kind of strange at first and they seem to make a big difference at the end...almost too big of a difference.

Rolling dice to determine hunting/harvesting results adds some randomness to it. So not everything is within your control...if that's the kind of player you are. ;P

A fun worker placement game, very heavy on dice rolls.

Rather a nice little game where there's always one more thing you want to do than actions available! Many paths to victory (and equally many to defeat) and playable in under an hour. However, if you don't like a lot of dice rolling, you're not going to like this...

If I had to show an alien visitor what worker placement is, I would pull out Stone Age. A near perfect example of the mechanic. It's balanced, simple to learn, and just complex enough for strategy. The boards and pieces are immersive and everything just fits. The use of cubes as currency rather than as building materials themselves is the only fault I can find when comparing it to the brilliant Egizia.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
2-4 player worker placement game.  Medium weight.  Light to medium luck.

Like the title applies, Stone Age is a game set in prehistoric times where you control a group of homo sapiens who are tasked with resource collecting, improving agriculture, and building infrastructure.  In order, players will place variable amounts of their workers across the game board, where spots are available.  The main mechanism resolves these placements by rolling a number of dice corresponding to the number of workers placed in any one area; hence, the more workers placed in an area, the better the chance you have of generating more resources.  Civilization and building tiles can then be purchased via resources accumulated, which is the main way to generate victory points.  Naturally after all this is done, you still need to make sure you have food to feed the family.

Gameplay in Stone Age is not overly complicated; the crux of the strategy is balancing your worker placement in things you need, while mitigating or preventing what your opponents can do with their workers.  I would suggest one play through is enough to become familiar with the game and how civilization and building tiles effectively generate points, so the learning curve is not very steep.  This is a very good introductory worker placement game because it highlights a few key things important to any advanced WP game (say, Agricola) but is not overly punishing.

Where the game really takes off is with 4 players.  Playing with 2-3, the game rules dictate a few placement rules which make it more restrictive, but Stone Age shines when the whole board comes into play with 4 players.  In fact I may have not recommended it at all... until I played with 4.  In doing so and opening my eyes to the beauty of the game, I can wholeheartedly recommend Stone Age as a well rounded entry level game.  If you are completely against any sort of chance (dice rolling, in this case) in this sort of genre, you may want to look elsewhere.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Another worker placement game.  The twist here is that rolling the dice determines how much (if any) of a resource a particular work gets.  Though luck does have its influence in the game the relatively short duration of the game combined with the frequency of dice rolls and the usually less than catastrophic effect of any one dice roll means that the dice rolling mechanic doesn't irk me like it might in other games where dice rolls determine the number of resources you get.

The best introductory game I had ever played, Stone Age fully derserves its high ranking position. The game is quite easy to explain, fast paced and has quite a lot of interesting options during its gameplay. Stone Age is in my book the introductory game to keep if you only want to have one in your collection. Good replayability, nice components and some deepth. These are the good qualities of this design. It works perfectly ewith non gamers and it is interesting enough for gamers. Didnt like the expansion though, since it adds complexity that the game does not need at all.

June 08 - 2 plays at AGE - Darn it!  It *IS* good! One of my few "first time I play it and it gets an 8/10" of the Expo.  Great mechanics in this worker placement Euro and the theme was fun as well. I was "baby man" and had great food problems... :)  The end game scoring is FANTASTIC as in my first game I was behind about 40-50 points, but won by about 10 in final scoring.  In our second game, we had no idea who would win until the final tally.  (May get more obvious with more plays, but it avoided 'screw your neighbour tactics, which was good).  Tense, as there is almost always 2+ things you want to do, and you KNOW you won't be able to do one of them by the time it comes around the table again.
Love it 2-player.

The dice ruin this game, a worker placement game shouldn't be this luck dependent, it's too long and frustrating. But the worst offence this game makes is that there's far to many spots to place your workers. That ruins the whole point of playing a worker placement game, there's no tension, there's enough spots that everyone will get what they want. Maybe it's just bad with 2, I want to give it a try with more people.

Stone Age works well as a two-player game for my husband and me. With no conflict other than competition for resources, the game offers a peaceful experience of exploring ways for a tribe to survive and thrive. The rules are not too complex, and the game lasts about the right amount of time for us--about an hour and a half from setup to takedown (even though we are both prone to over-analyze our options). It has some luck, but the most skillful player has won every game we have played so far. The integration of the theme with the game is nearly perfect, and the component are beautiful and a pleasure to handle.

I've been eyeballing this one for some time, and finally took the plunge. People are right about the smell of the dice cup...man does it frigging STINK.

Well, for what it is and what it accomplishes, the play time is far too long.

I should know better than to buy euros that are rated highly on BGG. I just don't seem to fit the mold of what constitutes a fun (euro)game on this site. It looks neat but for how simple the rules are, and the number of things you can do on a turn, why the hell does it take over 90 minutes 2-player?

This is one that I don't find very much fun at all....at least the theme is different, but as usual, like 90% of the top games on BGG, I find it dry, dull, and boring.

Played online. Not impressed. Fairly dull and seemed to get repetitive after only a few games. Paying resources to get cards for set collection or generating points doesn't seem so thematic to me; it doesn't feel like I'm building up my civilization in any meaningful way. Resolving worker placements takes too long, while other players have nothing to do. Too long for what it is.

That said, has enough going for it that I will probably pick it up when my daughter can benefit from the math practice.

It's a nice light-medium weight game with interesting decisions, but nothing terribly deep.  Lots of ways to score points keep it interesting.

This isn't a gamer's game, but it's a nice package in an hour.  It's simply fun.

My wife and I love this game. It's great with two people and she enjoys the pace. The theme is fantastic, and the art is phenomenal. Great game to introduce someone to the idea of economic games, I hope to use it to introduce my wife and friends to Cuba and Le Havre (but Stone Age will still see alot of play in it's own right).

Great game. Similar in some ways to Puerto Rico. (players take turns to choose an action. No direct conflict. All actions have a powerful opportunity cost to yourself and other players.) Everyone has to be on their toes and remembering the cards that everyone else has collected though. In this way dissimilar to puerto Rico, and a slightly larger, but very fun, element of luck. If you aren't comfortable with these memory or luck elements to the game, you may not like Stone Age. Much easier to learn and play than Puerto Rico, and prettier.

[gameid=34635] is a good worker placement game that has the bonus of being accessible to newer players. Beautiful artwork, easy to get into, and fun to play. It also scales very well from two to four players.

There is a bit of downtime while you are waiting for the other players to carry out their actions, but it isn't excessive.

Highly recommended.

Stone Age is an enjoyable but disposable game that will probably see three or four plays before I move on. It would have more staying power if it were shorter, but our games have lasted longer than the advertised 60 minutes.  I think the game's wonderful aesthetic appeal is a large part of what is drawing me back for repeat visits, because honestly this is a game without a lot of spark or nuance. It seems very weird to me that all the resources are basically interchangeable, and worth exactly the same in terms of VPs/pip.

[Update] Yup, I think I've played four times now. While I wouldn't object to playing again, I would definitely attempt to steer the selection to a different game.

This was my first foray into eurogames. And I must admit I really liked it! But it seems that I'm gradually falling out of love with it. I'm not sure why that is. The obligatory first player moves, the excruciatingly long playtime with 4, the 'place first then roll' part, the HUGE score differencies.. I still think it's a pretty decent gateway eurogame! Especially since the dice mitigate skill-difference between new and seasoned players. I find it good just not excitingly so!

Just a big fan of this game. Some of the moves seem very simple (use the Love Hut, increase your Agriculture at every chance, always buy the one resource card, etc.), but the game takes on its beauty when playing against human opponents when they thwart your strategy. Yes, the dice can cause you some issues from time to time, but I never feel like the game hinges on luck, rather I was too stupid and didn't send enough workers to get resources, which fits the theme. Yes, technically the game can be "mathed" out by figuring out what your best placement is on every turn, but that is usually not a game breaking flaw. My biggest complaint with the game is that the board could be bigger, a LOT bigger.

This game is so much fun! I was initially leery of the idea of a worker placement that includes dice rolling, but after trying and enjoying Champions of Midgard, we decided to give this a try. I'm so glad we did! It will never replace Lords of Waterdeep for us, but I love how the dice balance things between experienced and inexperienced players. It definitely requires you to plan ahead and adds some additional strategy trying to plan for bad dice rolls. I see this hitting the table frequently!

Stone Age is an outstanding game. It is straightforward to play (I would almost call it a gateway game) and it doesn’t hurt your brain too much, but it is still involving and full of interesting decisions. My wife loves this game.

Another game in the vein of Pillars of the Earth. There are no flaws in "Stone Age" (except that historical one that your men can dig for gold), but then, the feeling of the game is "been there, done that". Therefore I state it's a good and solidly designed game but don't expect any breathtakingly new if you already know Pillars, Caylus etc. You mainly roll the dice for resources to turn them into victory points. If Stone Age was released two years ago, it would be a major hit! But now it's only one of many games that uses those mechanics of placing your workers on actions. Maybe it would have profited if there was beside the economic development and the set collection for VP also something like a threat to prepare like the rats in Notre Dame or the enemies in Kingsburg.

Our gateway game ;) highly recommended!
It's beautiful, well designed with couple way to win, nice dice rolling mechanism (lot better than that in Ghost Stories for example) with just a little interaction which doesn't make game agressive but challenging. It's so positive game where you can see you tribe growing and developing. Result isn't known till end of play which makes it exciting. I only miss more complex buildings (which could do anything like making your worker more efficient) and after playing more game I think it's a little bit too long for this level of complexity...but again: perfect gateway which has brought us to games like agricola, caylus and so on.

Good game. A typical resource conversion game with a standard worker placement mechanic, in a simple and straight-forward format. The dice rolls, however, create a lot of chaos and unpredictability in the resource flow. If this game had truly been a 60 minute game (or max. 60-75 min with new players), my rating would have gone up and I would have considered it a terrific candidate (perhaps one of the best) for transitioning new gamers to more advanced resource management games. At present, I think it overstays its welcome a little bit, and the repeated dice rolls become a bit tedious towards the end. But it's still a fun game.

My introduction to the worker-placement genre.  You can start the game with a certain strategy in mind (e.g. focusing on getting lots of tools or additional workers) but this might change depending on what cards or huts are available.  Lots of tense decisions to make...you might really need that 3-cost civilization card, but you also need to have a way to pay for it.  So do you go for the card first and hope your opponent(s) doesn't hog the wood?  Or do you go for wood first and hope your opponent doesn't catch on to your desire for that particular card?

Combining hardcore worker placement (i.e. one person per round gets to increase food production, the end) with the squishier gameplay of the resource collection rolls doesn't really save this from my main beef with WP games, which is that too often, you have to play everybody's game, not just your own. You have to figure out what other people will want so that you know how long you have to get to it. And like... I just don't like this game enough to play a solo 4p of it in my head. Not even close.

Played this game for the first time in 2017 almost 10 years after the release of this game.  I think this may have been a good game for its time, but I don't think some of the mechanics have aged well compare to newer game like Agricola.  I didn't really like having to roll dice for determining a success off an action.  I also didn't like that by the time I could get a second worker the starting player had already done two complete turn with and extra worker.  We were playing a 3 player game and I didn't get to be first player until 3 turn and both other players obviously went for the extra worker right away.

An excellent worker placement game, with a light but well implemented theme.  The main strength is the different strategies that you can use to win the game.  A lot of games have one strategy that trumps all the others but in Stone Age there are 4 or 5 ways to win that are all equally effective.

RATING: 7
A worker placement game that is actually fun!  Lots of end-game points keep it slightly lower on my list because you end up trying to play memory with the other players' cards a bit too much.  But, there was a lot of chances for making points in a lot of different ways and that was great.  I loved the small scale of it all and the minimal art was actually a bonus.

RATING: 9
I found it to be simple and smooth.  I think family and other non-gamers might play while being able to follow and stay interested.  Looking forward to playing again.  Prefer this to Agricola which has become the worker placement standard.  The production quality, artwork, and gorgeous bits all put the overpriced Agricola to shame.  By comparison, SA is a value.  

It does seem that 3rd and especially 4th players are at a significant disadvantage, as they aren't able to start farming until 3 or 4 turns in.  Thus they must either choose the starvation path or waste more meeples hunting than the other players.  If playing with inexperienced or especially non-gamers, let them go first.  If playing with people who all know the game, recommend some house rules to help out the non-start players.  Not sure how to balance this, but maybe adding 1,2,3 or even 2,4,6 food to players the further down the turn order.  Not playtested, just an idea for now.  

Still, if you can play games "just for fun" (I can) don't let you put this off this delightful and beautifully produced Euro.

I don't like this game. It causes too much aggravation. I don't like how you use the dice to divide by the worth of the item you collect. It gets into too much calculation. Plus I'm getting an anxiety attack every time I play it, because what I want to do is what I can't do and what I can't do, I should, but I must do something else and it prolly won't help me. It's just not my kind of game. It's the calculation really that gets on my nerves. There's too much of it. I'd rather calculate stuff in Power Grid.

It worked well enough, but like many games coming out recently, I didn't feel like it offered anything particularly new or exciting. It also seemed to take too long for what it was. Manage your workforce, collect resources, exchange for points, rinse, repeat. I never felt like I was accomplishing anything other than generating points.

UPDATE: Another play hasn't really changed my opinion, but it didn't take as long, which is definitely an improvement. Adjusting rating slightly.

RATING: 9
This is a very good worker placement game. The unique element is the number of dice you roll is equal to the number of workers you place on a resource location.  This adds a 'press your luck' element that is different than most worker placement games (ie, if I need one stone, how many people do I need to place there?).

I think it is more of a Family game than a Strategy game as decisions are more tactical and your strategy is determined by the multiplier cards you buy. I can see why deep strategy players don't like it. It does seem 'samey' thru the game, but now that my family knows how to play, the game we just finished was very tense throughout the game.

Some people didn't like the smell of the cup, but mine smells like leather, so I don't mind it. (purchased the 2013 Z-Man version)

I also bought the Rio Grande 'Style is the Goal' expansion and all the parts fit in the main box.

Decent worker placement game. I do like that type of game so I may pick it up at some point but I already own plenty of similar games so I'm not sure how much table time it would get.

Great game, may revise the score in the future, but for now I just love to play this age. It's my first worker placement and it has a theme that I think I can use to get people to delve deeper into the board gaming world because of it's simplicity and socially acceptable theme (not everyone would love or be willing to play in Waterdeep for their first worker placement, I would for sure, but not everyone).

My first worker placement game and love the whole concept of the game.  I like the caveman theme and the whole game has really attractive artwork.  I like sending out my meeples for resources and buying huts and civilization cards.  It has steady movement with no stagnation, enough choices to keep involved and I like the anticipation of seeing how much scoring I can do with the civilization cards at the end.  I also like the idea of playing in 'rounds' with resetting everything and starting again each round.

What a fantastic worker placement game. I had only played Catan before this, and it never really hit the spot with me. I can't quite figure out the strategy yet, but I think that is what makes for a great game. It keeps you wanting to come back and see if a different strategy will get you into that winners circle. The bits and art are also great. I love the game board. One of the better ones that I have ever seen.

Update (Jan2012): I have now played games with 2, 3, and 4 players. It scales really well, but I think I enjoy it with 3 or 4 the most. This has become a favorite among my friends and tends to hit the table more than other games.

When the worker placement mechanic was still new, I thought it was a little derivative of "The Pillars of the Earth" - an impression strengthened by the board art and style. A few years and dozens of plays later, it is just my favorite worker placement game. It is also one of the lightest, due to plenty of dice rolls, but luck is kept at a tolerable level and there are ways to minimize it. There certainly could be a little more theme in the cards and buildings, and using random resources to acquire them does feel a little abstract, but it still is an excellent and somehow addictive game.

One of the better light-medium worker placement games.  Yes, the theme is tacked on and the scoring of goods for huts is arbitrary, but this is a good game with a lot of different choices and enough dice rolls that it averages out in time.

RATING: 7
I'm not very good at this game, but enjoy it nevertheless.

The first time I played this, on my dice rolling, I kept confusing the number of people and the value of goods. Also, I wasn't a huge fan of the hidden scoring, I just knew my experienced opponents had something up their sleeves... 

But overall, after more plays, I do find it an intuitive game and I like it.

Fun 'basic' worker placement.  I good game for gamers and for 'some' non-gamers.  While, I'll admit there is some luck in it, I'd say the game does last long enough that it averages out UNLESS you are really trying to 'push your luck' all the time, in which case it's your choice to have put yourself in that situation.

Először internet próbáltam ki, majd az nagyon jó tapasztalatok alapján vettem meg asztali változatban is.
A kifizettet összegért kaptam egy nagyon szép táblát, rengeteg fa bábút, jelölőt, kártyákat, épület tokeneket és pár dobókockát is. Abszolút megérte!
Több taktika is győzelemre vezethet, de mindenképpen figyelned kell játékostársaid lépésit is. Itt is fontos szerepe van a megfelelő akciók megfelelő időzítésének, egyben a többiek akadályozásának céljaik elérése érdekében.
A dobókockák szerepét nem érzem kritikusnak, sőt, nekem nagy kedvenc a kockadobás.

I am a big fan of this game. I am always weary of dice in games that last an hour or more, but I have found that any bad luck with the dice can be mitigated with a combination of tools and strategy. The game is much simpler than something like Agricola in the number of choices that you have available on a given turn. Depending on your audience, and what you are looking for this can be a very good thing. It is easy to teach, and doesn't suffer as badly from situations where someone is an expert that no one can compete with because they know all of the cards, etc. I generally play with 2 since that is my "group" size, but I have played the iOS version with 3 and 4 on multiple occasions. I think the game scales very nicely with 2 and actually like playing it that way. I believe it becomes more tactical and less random with fewer players since you can directly respond to your opponents strategy. Final note, there are multiple paths to victory in every game. I have won games, and actually been beaten by the best AI in the iOS game when he (or I, since I also employed the strategy after losing to it) did not build a single building. I have also built 8 buildings in a 2 player game and won. I win frequently against my living and iOS opponents without getting a single extra pawn, but can just as easily win with 9 or 10 out. The path to take always evolves depending on what your opponents do and what options are presented to you on your turn.

Es un euro, de colocar trabajadores, gestionar recursos y ganar puntos, pero uno un poco mas suave dentro del genero, que otros ejemplos del mismo. 

En este, se obtienen recursos mediante una combinacion de emplazar trabajadores y tirar dados (viene a ser lo "eficientes" que han sido los trabajadores obteniendo los recursos), sobre un mapa donde hay ciertos limites para emplazar los trabajadores. y luego con los recursos obtenidos se compran determinados objetos, que son los que proporcionan los puntos. 

Un juego con una jugabilidad muy agradable, sin ser por ello menos variado y desafiante, muy rejugable, visualmente por encima de la media en el genero. 

En mi opinion, un excelente juego.

Now I am very forgiving to derivative games, but I am not forgiving to overlong games. Stone Age is both derivative and overlong. It wants to be 45 minutes, but is closer to 90, and can drag to 120. To be fair, Stone is awfully pleasant--a solid worker-placement game. But it's not as good as Leonardo, Age of Empires, or Pillars of the Earth given its length.

Perfect gateway +. Works incredibly well with 2. Great into into the worker placement genre. The only reason that this isn't a 10 in my book is that it relies a little too heavily on die rolls for the level of strategy that it is, for my taste. Granted, the die rolling is a fun aspect of the game and there is a whole space designated to mitigating those very rolls. All that said, it's worth every penny. I'll never trade it away, it's a modern classic and is a must have in most every collection.

Formerly my favourite worker placement game, but recently overtaken by Tzolk'in and Snowdonia. It's the kind of game that's just fun to play - the pieces, board and simple rules make it a joy to ease into, while the luck of the dice adds fun without ruining the game on a strategic level. There are tough decisions, a small amount of screwage, but I always play with a smile on my face. (Played lots more on Yucata.de, unrecorded)

J'aime ce jeu. Je sais que c'est un placement de travailleurs assez familial où les dés sont très présents. Plusieurs joueurs aguerris n'aiment pas cet aspect. Mais je trouve que le thème est bien réalisé, le plateau est très beau et le matériel est sublime. C'est un placement de trvailleurs pas trop lourd qui n'exige pas une tonne de décisions et une réflexion d'optimisation constante. C'est un beau mariage entre la stratégie et le hasard. Je trouve parfois que le jeu demeure long (3 heures), mais mes expériences sont satisfaisantes.

Not my type of game at all.  You place workers to get resources then turn the resources into victory points.  Blah.  Winning requires 1) try to make the most efficient moves 2) benefit from turn order and 3) roll decent.

Although this isn't the type of game I like, I can recognize that if this is the type of thing that you like, this is a very good example of the genre.  It kicks the butt off of pillars of the earth, for example.

RATING: 8
Tentative rating. I'm sure that after more plays I would either be dazzled by the array of strategic options or disillusioned by the overpoweredness of a single one. This game is almost Agricola's evil twin. Both involve using workers to gain resources and then having to feed your workers. In Agricola, you feel you can never do everything you want to do and you are always on the verge of starvation. In this game, feeding the family is almost an afterthought, and you can score points in almost every category by the end of the game. I'm not sure if this is better or worse, but at least this game doesn't hurt your head as much or take as long. May be a bit too random for the amount of thinking here too, but that could just be an odd first impression. Bottom line, it's an intriguing mix of a bunch of different games that really do work well together. But it certainly doesn't break any new ground.

RATING: 5
After one play, I'm not very enthused by this game.  I don't hate it, but I don't really want to play it again.  This is possibly because at heart, it's a dice game -- rolling badly throughout the game can just kill your score, and that's no fun.  As many players have written, your score depends on how efficiently you convert die rolls into points.  The building tiles are worth as many points as the number of pips on the die rolls that you spent to get the corresponding goods.  Of course, if you can get goods by other means (such as by buying cards which provide resources to you, or benefiting from other players who buy cards with "resources for everyone" dice rolls on them, or by using tools to improve your die rolls), all the better.  Shrewd choice about which cards to buy is also important, so at least there is some strategic element to the game.

In my first game, I played the "don't bother to feed your people and lose 10 points each turn" strategy, and won by over 30 points (with a total of 177 points).  The strategy succeeded because I could completely ignore actions that would help me generate food, freeing me up to roll for more resources than other players.  I also chose breeding hut more often, and got all 10 meeples out, which allowed me to do even more every turn than other players.  Furthermore, I got 40 points at the end of the game because I bought cards that added up to 4 points per meeple, and 33 more points because I bought cards that added up to 3 points per completed building (of which I built an astounding 11).  It's possible that I was able to succeed with this strategy because I got to go first in the first turn; maybe going 4th (out of 4) would have made this strategy not-so-viable.

A surprisingly deep game, considering how many dice are rolled. Because the average results for resource gains are reached quite often, give or take one or two resources tops - and that is the major cause of all the dice being rolled.

This is really like a simplified Pillars with dice, but some of the challenge has been suppressed, while if you want to know the score of the other players, you'll need to recompute everything each time they draw a civ card, which feels a little cumbersome for a light game, but is the only way to play competitively.  You'll build small huts and each time you'll wonder why they serve no purpose besides the points.
The dice rolling for collecting ressources is fun, but much too important.
There are only 2 distinct strategies.
It is not a bad game - far from that; the components and the brightness of illustrations, the dice make it a pleasant experience; anyway, I would rather play Pillars, where the game starts slowly and builds up to the end, whereas in Stoneage every turn feels the same. 

After the few first games, Stone Age has just become dull and the inherent randomness is felt more and more.

Outstanding game, what a Euro should be!  Yes there are dice, but you can reduce luck by managing your resources (sending more workers).  Except for a few typos (like the use of Tools) the rules are clear and concise.  Mechanics and gameplay is clean, yet there are multiple ways to victory.  Game scales well with 2-4 players, although I suspect it is best with 4 (played a 3-player game and it remained close!)

Another worker placement game, this one spiced up with dice rolls that determine production. It's a good enough entry in a genre I don't much care for. I'm more than a bit concerned about the starvation strategy. In both of my plays, the starvation player beat everyone else by a very large margin, so it seems like a strategy that has to be quashed for any other to succeed. Oddly, I want to play again not because I especially like the game, but to see if I can beat this strategy. Or pull it off myself.

My wife and I absolutely loved this game.  The idea of gaining points through the purchasing of cards and multiplying this by other “investments” you make throughout the game (like adding babies, adding to the food supply, etc.) is a very clever mechanism.  In addition, you can score points through hut building, which makes some interesting choices when playing the game.

The components of the game are very nice, and I especially like the nice Stone Age themed dice cup that is provided (along with everything else that goes with the theme).

I can tell this is not one of my favorite games for my son, but I am not really sure why.  He is usually really good at figuring out games like this, but for some reason he has trouble with this one.

Oh, and one interesting tidbit for our particular situation:  We had been using tools completely wrong, and let’s just say it made tools less valuable.  Even with misplaying it like this, we really enjoyed Stone Age.  Now that we play it correctly, it is even more enjoyable (and my son won our first game playing it the correct fashion, so this may help his enjoyment of it in the long run).

Interesting in that it feels somewhat different mechanics-wise from many other resource collect/trade games. Suffers from having too much information be hidden, so that the final scoring is all-important, yet mostly mysterious. I do like the controlled use of dice, as you can overcome the luck factor by using tools to modify rolls and by dedicating more workers to the task (hence rolling more dice). Several different strategies are clearly possible. Kind of fun, but feels extremely light in comparison to other (superior, imo) games of this genre.

After Settlers of Catan we used to play this game a lot. I fount an unboxing video on youtube and immediatelly fall in love with the artwork. I started to play it at yucata.de and than followed at boardgamearena.com. We bought the original box and played it in person too. But after a while the game just got a little boring and it is rare to play ot nowadays.

Pros / Cons:
-I absolutely love the theme of the game.
-This is the most beautiful artwork that i have ever seen.
-The idea of the tool to manage luck is very cool.
-You have multiple strategies to play with, go for population, or just go with tools etc.

-But after playing this gem for such a long time we get enough of it, it was an outstanding step of our journey.

Fun dice rolling, worker placement game. Definitely a gateway game and would recommend this to anyone who's new to board games. 

Edit: Lowered rating from 8.5 to 8. I still like it but haven't been playing as much as before.

RATING: 6
"Spreadsheet Game". It's a derogatory term that successfully applies itself here. This game requires no interaction with your fellow players. It's a race for the VP and it's pretty straightforward. There doesn't seem to be anything truly unique about it...

If it aims to be a gateway game, it is successful, but less so than Catan.

For a long time, I really liked Stone Age.  There was something about it that I couldn't justify a 10 though.  Now I own a copy though, and am able to play it more frequently with 2 players.  It's surprisingly good with 2 for a Eurogame, and as such, I've updated my rating to a 10.

The different strategic choices to make are intuitive and varying so no game plays quite the same.  Dice can certainly jerk a person around, but the built-in factor of a worker count helps equalize that, or give you some control over your risk and luck tolerance.  I've learned to appreciate the tools much more.  The different objectives on each of the cards helps to keep you engaged, whether trying to track the symbol sets or simply chasing after the multipliers.  Of course, great artwork and a fun theme help too, as does ease of teaching and play.

$31.47 From Thoughthammer games. 

Today, we learned how to play Stone Age.  Game mechanics are reasonably straightforward.  Start with 5 guys, distribute them to earn resources and bonuses, and collect cards and huts to gain points.

7/8/2010: growing a little tired of the game, it has become the go-to game with Jenna and Aaron and while it has several successful strategy options, it isn't wildly diverse.

RATING: 7.5
This is a good game, if not a great one.

Basic worker placement, some shut-out nastiness, but it seems there's generally somewhere useful to go, if not the 1st thing you wanted for your neo-meeple.

Starvation strategy seems potent, but easily misplayed-need to clarify value of commodities in trading for food I think.

Again, a fun game, but not the tops for anything so much as a nice overall combination of elements.

Great game. I think I would prefer it if it didn't depend so much on cards. Really the cards are the way to win. Maybe if an expansion had some other method for generating points I would like it more.

That said I would rather play this than Agricola or many other worker placements. Which is a shame because the worker placement idea of a game is an idea I really like.

Updated to 9 - this game is fantastic. It gets better the more you play it and is excellent with 2,3 and 4... far more blocking with 2, dice bar becomes better with 4. Lots to consider

What do you know I've given this a 9.5... It is fantastic when you get a group of quality players playing but equally can be quite fun (though a lot easier) with opponents with less skill

I played this again after being introduced to it six months ago. I recall why I don't like this game as much. It is a dice rolling, "Yahtzee on steroids" contest. You will do well if you can consistently roll high totals with your dice, sort of like Kingsburg. The place your workers mechanic is simple and straightforward a la Leonardo Da Vinci. The theme is sort of light, but makes for good fun as you nurture your "cavemen" meeples. I don't mind this once in awhile, but otherwise I can't shake the fact that it is Yahtzee-esque with a theme pasted on top of it.

Update: After being 'forced' to play this three times, and finally winning a 4-player game by a squeaker, I'm reconsidering this game (perhaps it is the 3-player game that I can't stand). It's still totally dependent on your ability to roll high totals. However, what you do with those high totals seems to be the key to winning the game. The points turn into specific resources, which in turn can be converted into victory points through a variety of ways, but everyone is competing for those limited ways; blocking seems to be a necessary tactic. It seems focusing on one path is doomed to fail, while an aggressive and balanced approach may be better--this game rewards gambling: if you're lucky, you will do very well; if you're unlucky, you will be punished; and if you take the 'safe' route, well, you'll do so-so. I'm still figuring this out, but the comments about it being broken because it is based on luck seems on target, although I can see that getting lots of tools should remedy that somewhat.

Update (2/28/09): For my 4th game, I went all out for tools and the tool multipliers, plus went for 7 meeples early (which I thought was the optimum number for a 4p game), but ignored farms, and went half-heartedly for civ cards (in the past, I'd go all out for civ cards). The guy that went for farms and meeples with multipliers won decisively. The other player that went for converting good rolls into resources, and then into huts, tied with me for 2nd place. The winning player got 7-8 farms, which allowed him to get 9 meeples. With some tools, he was able to go after gold, and convert on several 1-7 huts. I'm finding this game intriguing, realizing that die rolling isn't as important (except when all players are of equal skill), as I initially thought.

Update (4/24/09): Another player went for 10 cavemen and multipliers and managed to get 200+ points in a 4P game. Another player went for farms and multiplies and did the same. I went for tools (and managed to get my first '4' tool ever), but fell far behind--all those tools need to be used to get good stuff, which I did not convert enough of.

Update (5/3/09): Okay, I admit it--this is a great game. The randomness belittles the marvelous interplay of players' actions, resources, and how they convert them efficiently into victory points.  There is substantial player interaction, since the resource collection spots, the farm, the tool shack, the "love" shack, the cards, and the huts are limited. I'm torn every turn, as I want to do everything, but have very few workers to do it with, while trying to thwart my opponents, or mitigate their counter-plays. I'm upping it to a solid '8'.

The box says you can play this game in 60 minutes. If I could ever get a game done in that time I would probably like this a lot more than I do. My games always seem to go for >90 minutes and, at that time length, Stone Age just doesn't give me the return on investment that I like in my gaming. A good but not great game because of that.

2011/01/20: Realized that my problems with play length meant I never brought this game out to play. It's not a bad game but it just never clicked with me. I think I'm also not a huge fan of worker placement games. I've played several and generally feel they are just "okay".

opinion after one play: Really enjoyed the game! The rules are very simple but still you have variety of choices to make each turn. The randomness suits the theme very well and yet can be managed. I don't know about replayability but decided not to care about it right now, as the game allows you to try several different strategies so it shouldn't be too bad. I expect it to hit the table every family meeting. Definitely buying it!

Got it, played it, love it! Current grade is 9. May go down to about 8 with time and more plays, but right now it's just awesome. And everyone wants to play it again.

RATING: 5
An inferior version of Pillars of the Earth (which itself was an inferior Caylus) with die rolling used to randomise the number of resources you get. There's a little scope for risk taking in where you place your people given the resources needed for a building and the need to gather food, but Pillars is much more thematic even if it is just as repetitive. The idea of sex behind the hut is cringe-inducingly funny though, I can't believe the publisher didn't spot that before this came out.

Bland worker placement Euro. The lightness and speed of play make it a small step up from Agricola and Caylus but it's still one I'd rather avoid.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The luck factor in the cards and huts actually far more effect on the game than do the dice. The cards in particular are VERY important and all players need to realize that.  The game becomes much more interesting late, when there is some tension about placing on a card vs. getting more materials or improving the value of cards you already have, but compared to other worker placement games, you have less information about what is good for your opponents and what is good for you, and most of your options are a little easier to get.  So, there's less tension, less basis for making decisions, less excitement.  (4 plays)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
IMO, this is the game that deserves the raves that Agricola receives.  The same type of game (worker placement/resource management), it manages more player interaction and more elegant design/gameplay.  It shares the luck factor (dice instead of initial card deal), which is it's one weak point.  I'll take the balancing of rolls over time over the "your stuck with these cards for the game" factor anytime.
In addition, this is an excellent gateway game for those you know will have some interest in Euros.  I've yet to have someone turn their nose up at this one.

A fun, lightweight worker placement and resource gathering game. Scratches some of that Catan itch but, to me at least, in a much more satisfying way. The luck-driven dice rolls can still make a turn hit or miss, but tool development allows some mitigation of that. Stone Age, and Lords of Waterdeep, both make excellent intros to worker placement and both work well as gateways. I'd give the edge to Stone Age only because the LoW theme can be a slight turn-off for some players (despite being barely skin deep).

Indifferent - unless 2p/3p online. I'm too good at this :>

Player hundred of this. Mostly 2p online. 

With so many point-salad games out there, I admire the overall structure of the game, very clean & pure(I have too many words for this, better just skip them here). In short, as concise as old school German, there is enough "meat" for a Euro gamer.

Despite the dice rolls, I am sure the luck is not an issue. it's strategic enough for 2p/3p, at least for one's first 30 games.

As most worker placement games, scalability is an issue: more downtime and less predictability(less strategic) with more players. I would rate 9 for 2p, 8 for 3p, but 6 for 4p.

This is one of the simpler worker placement games out there. There is entropy in the card draws and dice rolls, though some mitigation takes place through the market and tool use. Still, for a game of this length, I would expect more strategy and less luck.

First played July 10th, 2008. Taught in 10+min, played in about an hour with 4 players. The game has a great luck/strategy ratio. Each player starts out with 12 food and 5 people. Your task is to manage your resources to gain the most VPs. Resources are food(2 value), wood(3), clay(4), stone(5), and gold(6). Each round players can send a number of people to do ONE of certain tasks (gain resources, have a baby (requires two people; only one player can do this), increase food production (one; one; permenant food increase), develop a tool (one; one; helps gain future resources with one die pix per), build a hut(1 per hut; worth VPs; cost certain resources), or do trading (1 per trade; worth resources and VPs; cost 1-4 resources). After all player choose one, then may choose another single task for a number of workers. Keep going as long as someone has workers. Next the each player takes their actions, starting with the start player. A die represents each workers sent to gain resources. Roll each dice and sum the pix and divide by the resource you are trying to acquire. Rounding down, that's how many of that resource you get. After all players have gone, each pays one food for each worker they have. If you don't have enough you must pay one resource of your choice or pay 10 VPs. The game is over when one of the piles of huts are gone or the trade cards can not be replenished. I'd recommend this as a gameplay, especially if you know someone who has it.

Superb worker placement game with exceptionally strong production value, particularly the stunning colorful gameboard illustration of primitive men deployed in myriad activities in different landscapes like forest, hills, river, village, etc.  This game has a very elegant, smooth design.  It has a pleasant, brisk play time of about 1-1.5 hours.  It has a few well-balanced paths to victory.  There's something that is just really fun about taking turns, placing workers while trying to plan a clever sequence of actions.  Some players might not like the luck factor of rolling dice for resources, but I don't mind it a bit.  Player interaction is limited in this game to competing for limited spots on the board that workers are placed on in order to perform actions.  It is fun to anticipate where other players want to put workers and screw them by putting your own workers there to put the kibosh on their plans.  There will be opportunities to attempt a risky sequence of actions in order to earn a big reward, like placing only one or two workers to harvest gold that will be needed to build a building on the same turn for example.  This game deserves to be held in higher esteem and gets overlooked more than it should.

We played with two and I like it, but still think something is missing. We hope to try this with more people soon I think that might improve this game. 
Update: With four I like this game better.

Update 2009: Our daughter (7 years)loves the game and it is good for her math. I try to figure out a way to make the game shorter. 

2010 She is eight years old now and we play the full game, it is to short she thinks :) Changed rating from 7 to 8.

2011 This game gets better and better...rating up to 9.

2013 Still a favorite of our daughter. Very good familygame.

Gateway resource management worker placement.  Fairly simple (has lost it's appeal for me but is a great intro game for newbies, otherwise I'd trade it away).  Limited resource gathering for two types of point rewards, nice quaint theme.

Has 2 bonus tiles from the Russian Railroads mini expansion included in the base game.

Pretty bad game.

May08: I know, what the heck?  I played another worker placement game, by the makers of St Pete?!?  None-the-less, I did actually enjoy myself somewhat.  I do not need to own it by any means.

It suffered a couple flaws for me:

1.  All the resources were very "samey".  They converted back to points at the very same rate they were acquired.  Boring.

2. Many of the early moves are scripted.  Makin' babies and tools and food are just so powerful most of the early decisions are moot.


So, overall, I'd be willing to try it again.  If I did, I think I'd go for an all card route and see if it can be busted up just like the aristocrats in St Pete.

Excellent worker-placement game. Fairly easy to teach and learn. Dice rolling evens the game nicely, making it more beginner and family friendly. Various strategies may end up victorious, which makes the game interesting and it gets to be played often. The only downside is slightly long play time, but with experienced players the downtime should be minimized.

A very tight and competitive worker placement game, with enough luck thrown in with dice rolls to mix things up without undermining the engine-building present in the game.  The game has a very simple premise - make resources to buy building tiles which score you points, easy!  But there is added depth with bonus cards, the constant need to feed your workers, multiple alternative scoring opportunities and, of course, the dice rolling.

The game plays beautifully with all numbers of players as the rules impose some limitations on worker placement with fewer players, meaning the game stays tight.  Easy to teach but cutthroat, highly recommended.

One of the first games I played at a meetup. Bought it on my birthday from Universe Games on Lake St. and played with Gretch that night. Enjoy the game but decided to sell for a few reasons- want to downsize collection, the box is annoyingly big, the price is currently high, and the game runs long. Not a great gateway, because while the rules are easy enough to learn, the strategy isn't readily apparent to newbies. As a result I would also handily beat new players, which made it less fun. Decided Fresco would be a better gateway-ish worker placement.

Have played 5 games now, 2P and 3P with kids, (8 & 12).    Kids picked it up quickly and my 12 yr old LOVES to play it.  2P games ran less than an hour, the 3P, just over.  
Don't see a problem with resources running out, that would be a hoarding problem.  Good quality, pretty game.  I'll play it whenever, who will set it up?  11/08
****01/2011***okay, had to bump this up to a 10.  It is my daughters favorite game to play now, and she usually wins.  Still love how easily it plays and flows.  Don't have to  learn rules all over each time.  Have never felt the game plays itself, too many choices to make on your turn.

My first encounter with this game wasn't the best one and I had my first opinion clouded by bad dice rolls.
Today, after a dozen of games played, I realize there is more than just "lucky dice rolls" in the game, so I have started to appreciate the game. Spreading the collection cards seems to be key. 
I've played this game a tad too often over the past months, and in order not to "Catanize" this game, I better stay away from it for a couple of weeks :-)

RATING: 7
A beloved worker placement game that I enjoyed, even if strategy became very solidified and apparent every game after a few runs with more experienced players.  I don't understand the appeal of this game on BGA - it is fun enough to be sure, but after each game I felt drained as I believe it is slightly too long for what it brings to the table.  

Something I don't see mentioned enough is how mathy the game is.  While you can break down any game to math - I find myself seeing this game simply as an interactive math puzzle.  If you approach the game this way vs. people that do not - the game won't even be close.  Even with the frustrating RNG in the game, math wins every time.  My friend laments my approach to the game, but hey - Stone Age begs you to look at it this way in my opinion.   If I feel like number crunching and min maxing - Stone Age is the way to go, but bleh - that's no fun.

A good introduction to worker placement games.  It's one of the lighter ones.  You are a tribe of cave men, and you need to collect resources to feed your people, multiply, build huts, and increase the culture of your people.  You can roll dice to see how many of each resource you collect.  You can also build tools to help you gain more resources.

For me, personally, the game doesn't deliver and I'm not sure why.  Maybe it has something to do with the race element present (race for buying cards and buildings in this case), which I'm not a fan of.

Stone Age has become the fallback option of every game night.  It's a worker placement game boiled down to its best features.  There's dice for people who like rolling bones, a detailed scoring mechanic common to most Euros, plenty of strategy and beautiful artwork that's appealing to people new to boardgames.  Best yet, Stone Age is relatively inexpensive and quick to setup/clean up.  Highly recommended.

The designers forgot to improve on the 2 most needed areas if they were going to improve on Pillars, game length and luck. In fact, this is worse in both areas so now you have another really lucky derivitive game that runs FAR too long, especially with 4 players (luck factor is close). I will never again play with 4 unless some cards and buildings are removed to shorten the game. 

The game itself is decent other that what I mentioned, I do like the multiple paths and mutliple ways to score both good strengths. I think it is best suited to 2 players although a shortened 3 player game might still be okay and faster BSW plays would also be okay. 

Turn order is not compensated for and should have been, 1 extra food for 2nd player, 2 for 3rd player etc, 2 player doesnt suffer from this. Decisions are mostly very obvious (especially 4 player again) which also hurts this game but there is a little angst present as you want and need everything and know you wont get it. 

Great components, almost suited for gateway if shortened, repetitive, avoid if hate dice rolling (some luck can be mitigated but not all)

MAR 09 Moved up 0.5. The game is just so accessible to non gamers and there is more than enough in the game with the various ways of gaining VPs for more "hardened" euro-gamers. 

In fact, I like playing it with "newbie’s" because they don’t play in a predictable manner! Don’t you just hate playing games where everyone knows "the best move"? Or may be that is just me... (but explains my dislike of Puerto Rico!)

JUL 09. Up another bit - the game is just so accessible at different levels for people to play (not necessarily to win!).

SEP 2013. Expansion makes the game even better, but there are games I would rather play, although this is still a fabulous game to play with non-
gamers and gamers alike,

M&K: zou leuk spel zijn (Wiebe...)

Tof spel, ook voor Ward (7). Stamleden taken geven (jagen, leem, hout, steen of goud zoeken, stamleden bijmaken, een akker beplanten of gereedschap maken), "oogsten", en zorgen dat je iedereen eten kan geven. Spel komt eerder traag op gang; niet spelen met twijfelaars. Duurt nogal lang.

Speelt veel vlotter als je het spel al kent :). Ward (9) vindt het nog altijd een topper.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Certainly seems like a better entry level worker placement game than Waterdeep, but it's still not very exciting. The dice are mostly not bad because you're going to be rolling a lot of them and hut building in general feels pretty reactionary since you don't know what's going to be on offer next turn necessarily. The cards actually are particularly bad about this. If you go for people and no people cards show up then you're in trouble. And I really didn't like the cards where everyone gets something, way too swingy there. But ultimately for a game this light I can look past all that. Doesn't really do anything too new or exciting, but if all you want is an entry level worker placement then this is probably the game for you. There are actual strategies that can be implemented and some real decisions to be made, which is pretty good for a light game like this.

I like this game.  After playing for the first time, I had the same feeling I had after playing Ticket to Ride the first time: this game has some staying power.  The dice can be really harsh at times, but there are ways to mitigate bad rolls (an aspect of a lot of games that I love).  The game also flows very smoothly.

I'm not sure I like the worker placement aspect though. I feel that what I want to do in a round always seems to get taken before I can get it. I need to think about strategy a bit and play a few more times before coming to a final rating.

UPDATE (after 4 plays): something clicked with me last game. I saw something regarding trading in resources for more resources (getting more for less) that I didn't see in my previous plays. It's easy to trade resources for VPs one-for-one, the challenge is finding ways to do it more efficiently.  Not sure why I didn't quite realize this before. This one "click" alone has caused me to rethink the game and I *really* want to play more. Upping the score to 8.

Relatively simple but very enjoyable worker placement game.  Each turn you put one or more of your workers in a place that gets you resources with dice rolls or special benefits.  You always need to worry about getting enough food and/or farms to feed your mob.  You get points by buying huts with the resources and buy buying one of a few cards that are available each turn.  Multiple paths to victory and challenging options while not blowing up your head.  Dice rolls add fun element of chance but without the sense that you've lost the game because of a single bad roll.  I do have a sense there are better strategies than others though, so not necessarily fully balanced.  I was very unimpressed by the tech card approach.  But every path can be countered by other players if they have an equally good sense of how good they are.

The art is beautiful, the mechanics simple and smooth, and while there is some luck with the dice, I feel that it has a lot of appealing strategic variety.

Rated after 4 2-player and 3 4-player games.  Stone Age has brought worker placement into close to gateway status.  The rules are simple but the game allows a variety of strategies to play out.  The production is amazing; everything looks great and the dice cup is a nice touch.  The endgame scoring is a large percentage of your total, so you have to make sure you are planning for the end.

If worker placement is your thing, or Eurogaming in general, this is a must-have.  It isn't all too heavy, so the player base will range from kids to geezers.

This is quite possibly my favorite worker placement game I have played.  Two giant, caveman thumbs up!

This is one of the best games to introduce someone to Euro-style or worker placement games (my 75-yo mother in law had a good time with it).

A touch of Pillars of the Earth, a touch of Agricola.  So far so good, but I won my first game, which makes it hard to assess how much I actually like the game.  Update: I've played it a few more times, and I like it, but I'm still not sure where I should have it ranked.

Could have really used a player aid on my 1st play but still managed (the game could have used more graphic aids on the board as well).  An interesting mix, with lots of paths to victory it appears.  Getting a lot of cheap wood also seems important to be able to purchase the cards.

I love the look and feel of this exemplar 'gather resources then build' game. It feels less tense than Agricola; the randomness of dice can be 'beaten' by a pretty obvious tactic (use lots of them). It's also simple and quick enough to be a good family game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Excellent game for two-three players - pretty good for four, but with slight downtime issues.

The exception is the minimal penalty for starvation rule which can ruin the game.  It is anti-thematic and adds nothing to the game - Join the campaign for a starving-tribes-eat-their-own-meeples rule.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Simple mechanics provide for a lot of strategy in this game. Smart use of tools helps mitigate the randomness of dice rolls. The cards are extremely powerful—more than I suspected at first—and setting yourself up to acquire a building or card every turn towards the end is an exciting goal. That lovely, "Oh, you took my spot!" tension of worker placement is just the right pull against building up that end-game tempo.

Final thoughts: It's light, good fun and I enjoy it. Sometimes I am tempted to get a copy for myself.
-------------
Update: A handful of games later, and Stone Age is moving towards a "don't buy" for me. I like parts of it, and good strategy still eludes me (and yes, that's good) but the game feels awfully repetitive.
-------------
Update: My second game was less confusing, but the winner still pulled off a victory in a way I hadn't seen coming. I guess that is really a good thing... ;-) Anyway, while some aspects of the game are frustrating, others are quite enjoyable and I am eager to play again.
-------------
Worker placement in the stone age! Players place their meeples to gain resources, food, more meeples, tools, buildings and special cards. At the end of every turn, meeples must be fed (but they can eat wood, clay, etc. if no food is available ;)), so a certain focus on food production seems necessary - although not all may agree. Resources are used to buy buildings and special cards, which in turn yield victory points - buildings right away, and cards at the end of the game.

My first experience with the game was mixed. The game was reasonably fun but it had a lot of randomness, and the fact that the winner almost tripled his score by playing special cards at the end of the game felt a little, em, overwhelming and confusing (what's the point of scoring small amounts of points during the game, if the winner turns out to have about 135 points of hidden VP?).

Anyway, a solid game feeling like a mix of Pillars of the Earth, St. Petersburg, and Agricola (!) but not a game I am sure I really like. On the other hand my first game, while not very fun, had me thinking about it a lot afterwards. The same happened with Agricola, and I ended up liking that very much...

I generally like games that escalate somewhat, making it seem like the game situation changes as you go along, and making the endgame markedly different from the beginning. Stone Age has a bit of escalation, mainly in terms of players getting more meeples, a higher food level and more tools as the game goes on, but whether it's enough to satisfy my craving for a game with development, I don't know yet.

But as I wrote, Stone Age had me thinking, and I would certainly like to try it again.

Worker placement. Balanced in every single avenue -multiple ways to achieve efficiency in the game. Quick and easy - 3 player veterans game can be finished inside of an hour.

Not enough depth for an advanced gamer, but an easy nobrainer for setting back your brain.

I love this game and I could easily see this moving into my top 5. 

There are a few things that really set Stone Age apart from other Euros. First there is luck involved. Luck comes into play from the dice, from what buildings are drawn, and what civilization cards will come up. I think this keeps the game healthy though and easily encourage newer players to get into the game.

After playing a few times it's starting to grow on me...


7 is about the limit here.

It's biased a bit more to the luck based side than I prefer, though the quantity of dice rolling mitigate that a fair bit.

It feels a bit too abstract, and the decisions are pretty simple, as in determining the highest value to yourself.  Near the beginning, the choices are obvious enough, and near the end, they are obvious enough, too.

A little bit of right player binding here - the person sitting to the left of the newbie will tend to do better than the others playing.

Initial Rating : 8.0 (December 2010)

Having played Agricola and knowing Stone Age was a light-medium worker placement game (with dice to add insult to injury), I totally expected a negative reaction towards the game, however after some plays I really like it. Compared with Agricola, the game IS pretty light, but it still offers lots of interesting decisions AND it is very fun to play.

The rules are easy to teach, so my family can play with me and the dice adds (unexpectedly) a new layer of strategy. I generally dislike dice games, but in Stone Age you have to play the odds in a fun way. 

Perhaps the playtime is long for what the game offers, the theme is pretty weak for my taste(still better than Agricola) and the art and components are beautiful (except for the smelly cup although I have a friend who likes to smell it :S)

In conclusion, Stone Age is a game I enjoy playing right now with my light weight games oriented friends, but not a game I will request often so I have to downgrade the rating to a 7.0

After 30 more plays, I don’t want to play Stone Age as often as before. The gams has grown stale for me, it desperately need the expansion. I recognize it is a good game but I prefer to play other heavier games, so it is now a 6.0 for me.

There seem to be two major objections to dice among Eurogamers.  One school of thought hates having a long game decided by a couple climactic die rolls - the small sample size effect.  Another objects to the random incomes in games like Settlers of Catan, in which hexes depend on specific die rolls to produce.

Stone Age mitigates both of these concerns.  Because of the sheer quantity of dice thrown throughout the game, there is at least a perception that the randomness evens out.  And because income is determined by spending dice pips instead of locking in specific numbers, there is no Settlers condition in which a party is screwed by a particular number "never coming up."  The dice in Stone Age are fully realized as game elements to manage, and not chaotic forces executing a disproportionate impact on the game from beyond any player's control.

In this game, you play cave(wo)men who do stuff like collect resources, make tools and produce babies. The worker placement mechanic is fun, so is the use of dice. That's right, rolling dice is actually fun!

(Yet another) Euro efficiency optimiser. Spend actions (workers) to buy resources (or more workers), combine the resources to buy tiles worth VPs or cards that either give you in-game engine advantages or more VPs at the end based on sets of cards collected. 

Player interaction is limited to taking resources/tiles/cards before your opponents. Learn the tiles/cards and how to efficiently build your engine to win.

In fairness it's not my favourite type of game but my heart sinks everytime another one of these comes out - enough is enough!

A very well designed resource acquisition game.  The push-your-luck aspect of gathering resources through dice sums is both refreshing, and at times frustrating.

The perfect beginers worker placement game. Starting with a few tribe members, you have several choices to expand and enrich your tribe. Beautiful board, with strong colorful cards and sturdy tribe members. Dice rolls can break or make you in the resource depatment. An easy game to teach to your friends and family. Quick to set up and quick to put away. ps. Keep your tribe feed or lose.

--original comment--Worker placement Fun. Smooth play multiple ways to win.

Great game, this game is light enough to attract non-gamers and thought provoking enough to entertain the hard core gamers.  Nice mix of mechanics that keeps one interested throughout the game.
Some say this is very similar to Pillars of the Earth, even though it has similar mechanics I don't see the consistent comparisons.  This is like comparing "Gangster" (game id: 31621) to "El Grande" both area control, but Gangster sucks and El Grande doesn't.

Probably my favorite worker-placement game.  I love the tightness of the board and the randomness of the dice rolls for resources/food.  The huts vs. cards victory paths create a nice variety in gameplay and I feel like there's always a little more you want to do each turn (but not too much).  Fantastic game.

Decent worker placement game, pretty challenging for a few plays at least. There's almost no variability, which is good for people who prefer that luck play a smaller role in their games. For me, though, it hurts replayability. It's also low on player interaction, which I usually enjoy. For these reasons, I think Lords of Waterdeep is a much more enjoyable example of the mechanic.

Update: The more I play this game, the less I want to. It's at least partially the theme, which I find very uninteresting. There's nothing wrong with the mechanics (although, I don't love the rolling for resources thing), I would just rather play anything else.

Based on 1 play. Fun game - seems to have multiple valid paths to victory. I wasn't bothered by the three single player tasks (agriculture, babies, tools), but that might get old after a few plays. 
Edit: Have played a few times now, and the game still doesn't grab me, although it is a fine enough game.

I enjoyed this more than Agricola, since you don't have to buy your way to playing first so everyone gets a chance to do what they want at some stage. This also stops a single player running away with the game. Enough different choices and different strategies makes this friendlier than Agricola. A game I'll enjoy every now and then.

This game is mostly an unremarkable worker placement, collect resources to trade for victory points game. What makes it a bit different is that the workers placed do not automatically give you the corresponding resource, but influence the odds of collecting that resource. Resources are gathered by rolling dice, and the more workers you place in an area the more dice you get. So here you have a dice game that gives you a fair bit of leeway to strategically influence the probabilities. It's an excellent use of dice in a genre that generally eschews such random elements. Unfortunately, once you have the resources, you are pretty much just trading them in for points one way or another. The in-game scoring is a bit jerky, coming in 10-25 point bursts. The end game scoring can potentially have massive multipliers that are difficult for players to track in game, so what seemed like a close game in the playing can end up looking very lopsided once the final scores are tallied. The game scales okay, but I think would be best with a full compliment of 4. This is probably a good one to introduce worker placement to non-gamers and the dice probably give it a broader appeal than superior games like Caylus and Agricola. 

Great use of dice. Pretty fun. Bland mechanics. Problematic scoring. Also, the game runs a bit long for as light as it is.

Another relatively new game that is way overrated, IMHO.  There seemed to be a run of die-related games in recent years, of which Kingsburg is probably the best.  The jury is kind of still out on whether a deliberate starvation strategy is a consistent winner; I kind of think it may not be if other players are alert and know how to counter it.  There's quite a bit of luck in the order in which the cards come up, and I have rarely seen a game end with the cards running out as most players seem focused on scoring the huts.

I honestly can't judge it properly as a board game just yet, since I've only played the game online via Yucata.  However, the game itself works well and has become the quintessential Worker Placement model, in my mind.  The theme also works for me. The rating could go up or down based on my feelings about the actual physical game, once it finally makes its way into my collection.  I have lost some incentive for buying it, however, knowing that it is available online anytime and offers a great gaming experience there. 

Update:  9/19/2014 -- Finally bought it and love having it in the collection.  Great worker placement game that is tough to beat.

This is an excellent game.  Genuine decisions on both a strategic and tactical level.  Good theme-ing: other than the purchase of huts, most of it makes intuitive sense (love-shack, tools, farms) without being too complex.  Accessable for both gateway and advanced gamers.  Only those anti-dice snobs need stay away, even though this is a game of high skill and little luck.  For some reason I am much better at 2 and 3 player than 4 player.

A great family game.  The only thing that prevents it from being a great gateway game is the playing time.  For new players, a four-player game is easily 90+ minutes after the rules instructions.

A classic worker placement game with several viable paths to victory. Some complain of the "starve your people" tactic.  That can easily be house ruled.  I suggest that in addition to losing 10 points, you also lose one worker - after all, you did starve your people.

A great game that we recently brought out of mothballs.  Committed to getting this to the table more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Not impressed after one play. The implementation of the theme is abysmal in this game. There are cards to collect for no reason, and there are a ridiculous set of materials that are gathered and then made into generic huts (e.g. a hut made of Gold and Brick... riiiiiight). Gameplay wise, the huts themselves do nothing. They are worth points according to the resources gathered. In turn, the resources have straight-conversions to points in direct proportion to the effort made to get them, which is a technical way of saying the resources are completely indistinguishable. They offer no difference in pay-off and thematically are not required for different or even appropriate projects. The dice... *yawn*. They've been tamed enough that you wonder why they're even there. 

I would describe the experience of "Stone Age" as disheartening. Slick production values with no coherence. All style and no substance. 

Update: I tried this again two years later (August 2010), and though most of what I said above still stands, I can at least see grant Stone Age the Best in Show if things like Pillars and Vasco de Gama are the competition. The raw pip-to-point conversion and paper-thin risk management are at least reasonable given the time and pacing, but the real insight from my second play is that the spike of randomness isn't in the rolls, it's in the cards.

I really enjoy this game. There are several broad strategies and lots of room for creative repositioning. Many decisions rely on what your opponents have done and you are constantly trying to make the best out of the current situation. 

The worker placement can be interesting since you must weigh the value of placements against what others may value. The game also does a fantastic job of integrating the randomness of dice, and there is a very useful (though naive) equivalence between a pip and a point. This lends the game to a very clean zeroth order analysis which can be very useful when evaluating different strategies and opportunities in the game.

With over 50 plays on BSW and around 10 FtoF this game just keeps getting more and more enjoyable!  It's "Agricola Lite" yet surpasses Agricola in so many areas.  No, it can't compete with The 'Gric for brain burning number of turn options, but it's FUN!  I have a much easier time persuading my girlfriend to play this than the 'Gric. Granted she's not a "Serious" gamer, but then neither am I.  SA scratches all of my boardgame itches and will continue to do so for a long time to come.

Stone Age is my simplest worker placement game. It has got beautiful artwork and an irrelevant theme, but it feels friendly and nice. Very tactical, and highly unpredictable when it comes to end-game scoring, because of the square of the amount of cards you've got of the same type. It's also my least interesting worker placement experience; the stakes seem to low to care for your meeples. An entertaining game, nonetheless.

I would have given this game at least a 7 if it were the first worker placement game for me. But I already know a few others like Pillars, Agricola or Maestro Leonardo. There's something to the worker placement mechanic which makes these games feel repetitive quickly - even on the first play. Stone Age certainly offers room for clever play as the experienced player in our round demonstrated. There are enough dice rolls for luck to even out and luck can be mitigated by investing in tools. The dice do add to the game for me. But in the start the worker placement is formulaic and in the end it is too long for the limited variety it offers. I don't feel the urge to progress on the learning curve. Probably, that's the key point what bothers me about this one compared to other worker placement games. I feel that you can "learn" this game while for example in Agricola you will always find new situations and in Maestro Leonardo you have to focus more on what others are doing and adjust your strategy accordingly.

15 April 13 Love this game! Because it wasn't in the top 10 we held off buying it. Some comments put us off too - just another worker placement game. After playing this several times - 2, 3 and 4 player - I can assure you this is not 'just another worker placement game'.
Yes you place workers but it is just so interesting that it captures your attention for the whole game. 

Our group likes the fact that you can get blocked but not easily. Essentials - food - you cannot get blocked from and you can resolve your actions in any sequence you choose. This means you can be clever and get cards, buildings and materials by resolving in imaginative ways.

We all love placing and then resolving. Because you roll dice for resources and often for cards too you never know how much you will get. You can mitigate against bad dice rolls by developing your tribes 'tools'. Each tool adds +1 to a roll; you can develop up to a whopping 12 tools!

The end of game scoring is a blast too. You collect multipliers via the cards along the way which remain hidden to everybody else. You're never too sure how much you'll add to your end score.

I can't believe this isn't in the top 10 it is so good.

PS Get the expansion too. It's brilliant!

14 Feb 14 - Okay, so it's getting a little 'rinse and repeat'. Basically I know I'm going to collect and do a little bit of everything. If you don't, you will lose. Not jumping for joy when someone wants to play it anymore. The Jewellery expansion does give this some legs but not much. Down to an 8 I think.

26 July 14 - Boring. I'm just going to collect a variety of huts and cards. That's it. That's the game. Whoever collects the best (depends on luck too) will win. Will only play now if everyone else wants to. Otherwise, no thanks. Down to a 5, I think. Kemet anyone?

A lot like other worker-placement games, but with one main difference: a little bit of luck factor thrown in with some dice rolling. The luck issue is not a huge factor, however, as you can use tools to offset the role of a die. This game can be a little difficult to figure out who is winning until the very end, which can be viewed as a positive or negative depending on your preferences. I like playing this game due to the fact that it is easy to teach, quick to play, and relatively fast to setup and put away (for a worker placement game). However, I prefer Agricola and Pillars to this one if given a choice on what to play.

I'm sure it's partly because I lost fairly badly, but I didn't really cotton to this game. My chief complaint was the extensive downtime during the resolution. It really made what was kind of a cute game into a drag for me. It may have been a failure of vision or flexibility on my part, but whatever I tried to do didn't seem to work because of my place in the turn order. While I have nothing against dice or some random elements, the combination of dice, cards (both the huts and the resource/VP/multiplier cards), and turn order left me at the game's mercy. Like I said, probably some sour grapes here, and everyone else seemed really to like it, but I suspect it'll be a flash in the pan even for them. Personally, I wouldn't play again easily.

All right, I played it one more time. It's better faster, but still not very entertaining.

Played thrice. Quite enjoyable and I like the idea of setting your own odds for dice rolling. However, i'm begining to see why the novelty of this would wear off after a while - just too little decision making once you get the hang of it? I clearly haven't got the hang of it because i still can't win. Still enjoyable though.

RATING: 8
Rating went up after playing more worker placement games, particularly Lords of Waterdeep. LoW is a great game but Stone Age gives you an intellectual challenge that is fun and rewarding at the same time.

I love the decision you need to make to place one, two, three or more workers in each space blocking the rest of players and blocking yourself for more options in the future.

Only drawback I see is its cap to 4 players. The expansion seems "too much" just to have the 5th player.

Played it last night with 2 players for the first time. The rule book is alittle hard to understand, especially with the civilization cards and buildings. I believe we played it right. But it was a little confusing, don't get me wrong I there is alot of strategy and it's pretty fun. I think it would be best with 4 people.

I like it a lot.  Decent little WP.  I'd have thought the dice gave it enough entropy, but my wife isn't a fan.  Maybe it's because viticulture.  I think it's really because I played in on the iPad and learned alternate strategies too quickly.

RATING: 5
When you first encounter the game, the dice seem like a deal-breaker.  It also seems way too similar to games like Pillars of the Earth, with a theme just as lame.  But the game holds together remarkably well.  The dice seem to, for the most part, even out, not making too big of a difference.  The game also feels different than Pillars of the Earth, a little more cohesive with more variability.  I especially like how each player does their entire turn at once, seemingly reducing downtime.  I have two gripes with the game.  First, it seems like the player going last in a four-player game is at a serious disadvantage.  Second, the game length is a little too much - at 60 minutes I would be playing this all the time, but it seems to last around 1.5 hours.  Hopefully the game length will come down with a few more games under our belt.  Also, who designed the box insert?  I had to laugh looking at the box upon receipt.  Even after punching the cardboard the box won't close. 

Anyway, enough whining - Stone Age is good plain fun, a satisfying experience that should be approachable for new gamers yet still challenging for seasoned gamers.  I hope there is no optimum path that is discovered.  The starvation strategy seems strong, but not necessarily overpowering, at least not yet.

Update: After more play, I find myself liking it less each time.  It takes too long, feels derivative and I never have the desire to play it.  Traded away.

Probably one of the favorite worker placement games I've played in a while.  Lots of rolling, but I don't mind it too much.  Yes, bad rolls can hurt you, but I just didn't seem to mind it as much.  I found that preferable to trying to get bread baked in Agricola and having that slot keep getting filled.  It felt like even if one strategy got blocked there was usually a good second choice.

RATING: 7
I have a love-hate relationship with this game. I don't like dice rolling...and in this game, consistently shitty dice-rolling means you lose.
However, it is also a worker-placement, resource collection game, which I do like. But what really works well is the coupling of huts and cards. The random nature of the cards is such that one strategy will not always work (compared to, say, Puerto Rico or Dominion, where a superior strategy will always dominate).  This game was hard to find when we were looking for it...so, if you do find it, snap it up and you won't be disappointed. (Also, the episode on Wil Weaton's TableTop, on the Geek and Sundry Channel where they play Stone Age is quite amusing.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A very weak Euro based loosely on Pillars of the Earth. While there is a semi-decent game in there, my rating is based on the fact that there are many, many games which capture the essence of this game, but do it SO much better.

Gripes: firstly, the dice for resources was a horrible idea, and we noticed that one lucky dice-roll was all that stood between the top 3 players. For an economic management game, thats just stupid. Secondly, in the early rounds, all the players were forced to either take a tool or increase their food. There is no other way to play it. The smart play is just to get these things as early as possible. And finally, the game just takes too long. For such a random luckfest, it overstays its welcome by at least a half hour.

Better alternatives to playing this game: Yspahan, Pillars of the Earth, Caylus or St Petersburg.

A great family game with beautiful art. 
Honestly, this game is probably in the top three or four games I own as far as presentation. The board is a work of art.

The game itself is simple enough to be played by a 10 year old (requires basic math skills, especially division). At the same time an experienced gamer will find enough choices and strategies to keep it interesting.

Easy to learn and lots o' fun. What more could you ask?

A simple worker placement game with a lot of different strategies and possibilities. A very interesting points counting mechanics, which uses multiplication and thus favours players who collect the same type of cards. Dice are used often, however they are not the main part of the game. Their effect is quite important, but it is possible to plan the situation a little. The game becomes less dependent on the dice in the end.

Paprastas darbininkų statymo žaidimas su gausybe įvairiausių strategijų ir galimybių. Įdomi taškų skaičiavimo mechanika panaudojant daugyba, tokiu būdu suteikiančią privalumą renkantiems tos pačios rūšies korteles. Kauliukai nors naudojami dažnai, nėra pati svarbiausia žaidimo dalis. Nors jie lemia nemažai, bet tokius dalykus bent šiek tiek įmanoma planuoti. Į žaidimo pabaigą priklausomybė nuo kauliukų mažėja.

After multiple second chances, I continue to hate this game. The end-game point swings are ridiculous. It's absolutely impossible to formulate any kind of strategy during the game. You could have perfect card synergy and still loose by 2 points - and when in-game scores are in the 30's and end-game scores are routinely over 200, there's simply no skill involved, and it's frustrating. It ends up being a worker placement game that somehow manages to have all the skill and luck of Yahtzee. Yeah, I went there.

RATING: 10
This game is a clear 10 for me in its online BSW format (and I don't make this statement lightly - check my ratings). In person I would give it a 9 or 8 because it is a bit too slow for frequent in person play. At half an hour the game is the best yet created (for my taste) - at 90 minutes it is also good but there are many games I would choose first. Since it is available online and I have learned so much from the game I am finally going to give it a 10 (it was only a 6 after my first four plays).

What I love about the game is that every decision is interesting and fast. The probability elements are perfectly implemented. It is clearly a game of skill - a few people have played hundreds of 3 player games with win rates of 80%, and yet average players can share a table with very good ones and have a chance at winning. Contrary to many comments I have read I am certain that it is a very deep game - I am still experimenting and learning new things. The game is fantastic for 2 or 3 players - 4 player has fewer interesting decisions and a lot more downtime but is still playable.

RATING: 9
A great worker placement game and more fun and easier to teach people than Agricola. Dice rolls and card selection allow for the game to not be decided by the first few opening rounds which places it above Agricola for general appeal.

There is a theme breaking rule in the game I dislike: if you can't feed your family you only get -10 points. Personally this breaks the feel of the game as you can now out reproduce everyone else without enough penalty. But I have won a few times using it so I guess it gives more options to the game.

One of those arbitrarily themed* economic engine games where player interaction is restricted to action hogging. First impressions possibly dented by the fact that we got [-]two[/-] three rules wrong for most of the game (the rules explainer didn't participate). Otherwise I wasn't bothered by dicey randomness so much as the fact that different card acquisition strategies turned out to yield vastly different amounts of points at the end for... I don't know what reason exactly? Also the whole game feels sort of bland, but I might well like it more after a second game where I have a better idea of what's the "right" and "wrong" things to do with your workers.

*I'll grant that there is some flavour to the love hut. However, it's not like you couldn't say you need to invest two robot-hours in order to increase efficiency by the equivalent of another robot-hour.

A keeper that I am willing to play anytime.
The use of dice is genius and the couple of strategies it offers are great food for thought.
Each game could feel a tad different, depending on what you are striving for, victory-wise.
Wish it handled 5 though...and that, sometimes, bad luck can really ruin a late-game turn.  This decreases final rating by 1-1/2 points or so.

Anyways, Stone Age. It's a fun worker placement with some dice rolling that appeals to a wide variety of people. I don't care all that much for it and would prefer to play almost any other worker placement over this one. Not because it's bad but it's just a smidge too luck-heavy for me so I always end up going for the starvation strategy. A game you only find yourself having fun playing in a single, predictable manner... yeah, no thanks.

I have to agree with the consensus here: this is a solid worker placement game, a terrific family game, and a gateway to the worker placement genre. There is nothing unnecessary. A clean elegant design. There is certainly luck, but it's all based on easy to assess probabilities there is nice tension in how you mitigate this. It also works well with 2, 3, and 4.

You can't beat Stone Age. I love all the choices available each turn and I enjoy that there are many paths to success. There is enough luck to keep each game fresh and yet not so much luck that it dwarfs the effect of your decisions. There is no runaway-winner factor since some points are kept secret while others are displayed. Fun all 'round.

Is fun and pretty easy to teach, I'm not a huge fan of the 2 player game (it's okay but not great IMO), but I find Stone Age really drags at 4-5 players because of the dice rolling, games can last quite a while for a relatively lighter game. Now that we play heavier games my group doesn't go back to this much (no plays in about a year).

This was another game I thought would be a great gateway game and would involve a lot of dice rolling.  It certainly did the latter part easily, however it didn't bring that "take that" factor as well as Kingsburg does it.  During my hunt for reviews, I basically broke down and bought both Kingsburg and Stone Age at the same time.

When I first got the game, I was already spoiled by playing this online.  The games were quick, it was easy, and allowed a lot of "planning" ahead of time.  When I got the board game it felt laborious and not so much fun.

The failing point for the most part for me is the fact that you KNOW what the best moves are, but cannot capitalize on it purely because of the turn order.  Also, when playing with mixed skill groups, the turn order being static hurts game play a lot because a bad move by a novice can aid a vet player pushing them far ahead.  While sitting next to a vet would mean you always get second best 3 / 4 turns (unless you go first).

The hidden point system was an up point in reviews I've read, and it certainly is.  Ironically this game provided the tightest games in most of the board games I've owned.  In my first few plays with my group, our games were separated by no more than 4 points between the top two players.  This ended up being the same way through our first four games with exception of the first being a learning game.

Still, the game scores probably wouldn't be so close if the players that were new didn't make the less optimal moves to aid players making the most optimal moves.  So I have to decrease my score to a 7 just cause.

7 for me is still a SOLID GOOD game, but I have more fun / enjoyment with other games so far...  I would still play the game if called for easily.

I've played this game 5 times, 4 players every time.  It's really fun.  It's an excellent gateway game for worker placements - that can eventually lead casual players to play more difficult worker placement games like Agricola.  Casual players can easily pick it up, rules can be explained within 10 minutes, and gamers will still enjoy the strategic depth.

There's some die luck involved, but generally will not affect the result (even though it might seem like it always does when you get a bad roll.)

The Good: Gorgeous board, very nice components. Many different paths to victory. Dice do introduce some luck, but it is not too much. The dice keep it from becoming a much heavier euro-game.

The Bad: This game runs way too long for what it is. The dice do introduce some luck into the game, which some may not like. 

The Ugly: The lid does not fit on the box correctly. Although I was able to figure out the rules in the end, there are sentences that just do not make any sense in the English language. It is obvious that no one bothered to even casually read the rules before they were published - what was Rio Grande thinking ? Also there is a two page add-on to the rules that for some weird reason is separate from the rule booklet.

We've played this twice now with the family - parents plus two boys (12 and 9) and enjoyed it quite a bit.  The game moves briskly, so everyone stays involved throughout the game.  There are a number of choices to be made each turn, some of them difficult, but it is not overwhelming to the younger players.

I find that in addition to the mechanics listed on the game page, this game has a touch of the role selection mechanic like in Puerto Rico, as only one player can be the toolmaker, farmer, or baby-factory in a given turn.

RATING: 8
Standard Euro-game worker placement type of game.  Very enjoyable to play two player or up to 4.  Easy to learn as well, so good as an introduction game for the new or non-gamer in your family.  The game is also top quality production-- nice solid components, great artwork and even a real leather dice cup. 

My only negative is that there is a possible path to victory that involves never feeding your people and just take the -10 points per turn penalty.  I suggest a home rule of increasing that penalty by another -5 points each time an individual player has to pay it.

One play, and I was unimpressed. But that is probably in part because I played against opponents that didn't see the same relative values I did. I just kept buying cards cheaply whenever possible throughout the game, and I more than doubled the second-place score. Just seems to be primarily a game of obvious choices.

Oh, and rolling high is a massive advantage.

Stone Age is a beautiful worker placement game with draft, set collection and risk mitigation elements. Let’s break down that sentence.
Beautiful: The printing Z-man did is the best I have seen in any game. The colors are rich on an unmatched scale. The art is also amazing, detailed, realistic and a bit cute.
Worker Placement: The turns are set up so that each player has very little time to wait between their turns because turns are separated into phases where each player gets an action. Each action gives the next player something else to react to without overwhelming them with too many options. This means player’s minds stay engaged without triggering analysis paralysis (AP).
Draft & Set Collection: Players have multiple ways to increase their score depending on how much they are willing to pay … or how little they believe their opponents will pay.
Risk Mitigation: There is not much engine building here. Instead, players have ways to minimize the variances of the dice. This is done via tools that can be used to increase the result of a dice by a number equal to the quality of the tool. Also, a farming track provides food for you tribe so more workers can be sent to collect resources, further mitigating the risk of die rolls

RATING: 5
I get why people like it but as someone who has now played a ton of worker placement games, I just feel like there are so many better ones out there.  Ninjato often gets compared to this game (maybe wrongfully so) and that is one I like better as its not as dry as this one.  I personally find Stone Age much more routine and mechanical especially since many players go for the same opening move each turn. If you haven't played a resource collection game before then that part is neat (though I'd recommend Kingsburg for that instead) but I also find the gameplay repetitive in going for the VP tiles and ultimately I just felt the game didn't hold interest after repeated plays.  I've played this one ALOT as it's many groups favorite or at least a game everyone knows when no one wants to teach or learn something new.  I'd literally almost rather play anything else at this point but if I do play I don't dislike the game or anything like that.  Basically its the perfect definition of a '5' in BGG terms.

REPLACED BY / RECOMMENDED INSTEAD:  Ninjato, Kingsburg, Carson City, Alien Frontiers, Lords of Waterdeep

I like Stone Age a lot. I think that it is a fun game in its own right, and also a great way of introducing people to the worker placement mechanic before moving to a more complex game like Dungeon Lords or Agricola. The luck is not unbalanced and fits the theme. The artwork is beautiful and also fits the theme and the bits are fun to play with when it’s not your turn. There is a decent about of strategy as far as planning each turn and planning your scoring for the whole game. Trying to beat out an opponent for a particular card or hut can cost you elsewhere so you need to prioritize your actions each turn, and come up with alternate courses for if your opponent beats you to your goal.

Stone Age is probably the best in worker-placement games.  Solid on theme and top-notch components and artwork, a very light civilization-building theme that doesn't get in the way of the game play, fairly easy to learn but with slightly complex scoring rules.  

So why is it up for trade? Well, the problem with every worker-placement game is that it has to have a theme that grabs you - otherwise, it's an exercise in management and scoring maximization, and if your other players see it that way they won't enjoy it.  So it's between this and Lords of Waterdeep for me.

This game used to be the best worker placement game for my wife and me. However, as soon as we started playing Puerto Rico, Agricola and Caverna, this could never hit the table again. It is little too lightweight compare to others meaning the depth of game play is bit swallower than the others. I don't see I will ever play this again over other worker placement games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fun and extremely well-designed game. The board and components are gorgeous. It's strategic enough to keep serious players engaged, but simple enough to be accessible to children. My only complaints are that it doesn't punish you for breaking its theme (the starvation strategy should not even be an option), and I'm not a big fan of the endgame scoring. It's too easy to think that you're doing fine and then get blown away at the end. Still, Stone Age is a solid gateway Eurogame.

Excellent worker placement game where you want to do more actions than you can every turn.
The different paths for victory points seem very balanced.
This game can lead to some analysis paralysis which is typical for worker placement.
I personally think the dice rolling in this game is a good mechanic, but if you do not like a game where a bad dice roll or card draw can potentially sink your turn, then this game is not for you and you should try Caylus or Agricola instead.

Good game, unless you don't allow starvation.  Without the possibility of starvation, breeding is not a reasonable action to take.

Generally a decide then roll game with dice, but there are so many many many rolls, and the rolls are simply cumulative pips (as compared to binary success/failure) that it balances out fairly well in the end.

RATING: 6
Liked it a lot initially, but have lost a little interest. Another clever use of dice in this relatively straight forward resource management gateway game.  Is also a good math exercise for younger players. I think the focused approach is better than the shot gun approach to maximize resources as well as a good balance using both huts and cards to obtain vps. Expansion of your clan will depend on the scarcity of food, but statistically, each extra person should increase your productivity for lower cost resources.

It's difficult to give a small explanation of this amazing game, but I'm still gonna give it a go. You both start out with five workers, or 'your camp'. Each turn you divide the workers across the board. Each worker resembles one action or dice throw, depending on were you put them. Examples: Throwing for raw materials, building huts, buying cards etc. The cards and huts give you points and can be bought for raw materials you collect. At the end of each turn you also have to feed your workers, so make sure you also make sure to occasionally put some workers on the savannah (to hunt) for food. The cards you buy and choose (yes, they are face up for you to choose) can be used for different strategies to collect the most points and win, so there is not ONE way to win. Altogether a very fun game and very quick to understand.

This has a great, very fun resource/skill gathering mechanism to make for a great simple worker placement game, but the scoring mechanism (huts, which basically let you trade all resources at a fixed value in fixed combinations) is too bland and ruins the game somewhat.

I really enjoyed this game.  I like elements of turn management and resource management even though I'm not always very good at them.  The village seemed important to play and was hotly contested in our game.  I underestimated the value of the cards in our game.

I would pick this game up again in the future. I own a lot of Euro games and this one just will never really be "the one" that I want to play.

I like it more than a lot of other games I've played. Probably more of what I'd consider a personal gateway game.

Stone Age seems a bit complex at first but after a few turns we got the rules down and it played quite smoothly.  The game was pretty fun but after 1 play I can't tell how much strategy is really involved in this game.  After a few more plays I'll be able to give a better rating of the game.

La gente lo compara con el Pilares de la Tierra, pero creo que son compatibles en una misma ludoteca, este es más corto que el Pilares y creo que algo mejor. Es fácil de aprender y tiene muchas estrategias a seguir para ganar.
Es un juego que merece mucho la pena y a la gente que lo prueba por primera vez le suele gustar mucho. El pero que le saco es que una mala/buena tirada de dados en un momento puntual de la partida puede decidir la misma.

I've enjoyed trying to figure out the viable paths to victory that were left open to me from game to game. I ended up deciding that the game exceeded my luck threshold for a game of this nature. I don't mind the dice so much, (you can mitigate that with more workers and tools) it is the order of the random card draws that heavily determines the outcome.

I liked the dice mechanic. It adds some manageable luck to the worker placement genre. That mechanic is something a lot of people have problems with regarding this game.

The problems I had with the game were it's progression and tempo. The game shines as a 3 player game but it just takes too long. Even as a 2 player game it feels like it drags on too long. Furthermore I don't really get the feeling of progression as I want out of my games. It just feels like I'm grinding out victory points for an hour and a half. 

It's one of the few games I think is more enjoyable to play online than on the tabletop. 

Artwork is well done. Michael Menzel makes beautiful illustrations and the components are out of wood and decent. However I felt the theme didn't connect with me at all and didn't elevate the gameplay in any way. 

Finally I think the scoring mechanic is overly complex for what the game is. It's a fairly easy game to teach people but it's going to take them 2 playtroughs to understand the scoring.... which honestly is the whole strategic aspect of the game.

Great worker placement game. Not probably the best game in it's genre, but fun and fast (with right group) to play. The dice mechanism used here is interesting. The game might be too repetitive if you play it a lot - but I don't play it that much, which why it isn't issue for me. Plays better with 3 than with 4.

In Stone Age, the players live in this time, just as our ancestors did. They collect wood, break stone and wash their gold from the river. They trade freely, expand their village and so achieve new levels of civilization. With a balance of luck and planning, the players compete for food in this pre-historic time.

Players use up to ten tribe members each in three phases. In the first phase, players place their men in regions of the board that they think will benefit them, including the hunt, the trading center, or the quarry. In the second phase, the starting player activates each of his staffed areas in whatever sequence he chooses, followed in turn by the other players. In the third phase, players must have enough food available to feed their populations, or they face losing resources or points.

You quickly run out of room to improve your game.   There will be no new thoughts here. I'm not one of the people who gets a special thrill every time dice are rolled.  If I want to have a wrangle with the Random Numner God, I've got a house full of other games that do this, most with a host of mechanisms for luck mitigation, and the odd game where 'ha! ha! -- cannot roll a seven to save your life!' is actually part of the fun.  Not for me.

Too much luck for this level of strategy. I mean, you have lots of decisions and options but basically what finally decides the game is how you rolled the dice. 

After second play: My opinion is almost the same (rating went up from 6.9 to 7.1): this game is too complex for an entrance game but too much luck for a complex (or simpler gamers') game. Still, nice theme and nice components. All this in a box which just doesn't fit the game.

[2008.Sep.12] The die rolling aspect overpowers any real strategy. Simply put, more rolls with valuable (in game) outcomes equals a higher likelihood of winning.

Played this with friends and ordered it immediately.  It's broader in scope than Agricola and has simpler mechanics.

Civ cards: extra sets are also squared (according to HiG).

"Hunger Strategy" (NOT "Starvation Strategy"): viable strategy approved by game's designer. (Not having enough food means people must beg for it, losing prestige in the form of 10 VP; or, the -10 VP come from a lack of comfort/contentment/security as a tribe miserably scrapes by with the bare minimum of food necessary for survival; or any other plausible explanation.) At no point does the rulebook mention "starving"; players who take issue with this strategy are making a thematic assumption unsupported by the game's designer (and publishers).

Each resource (not food!) on a player's board at final scoring is worth 1 VP.

Scores can go into the negative.

A medium-weight dicefest of acquiring resources, cards and tiles while managing your cave meeples, giving them food and tools.

Worker placement game involving dice for production quantities of different resources.  Different ways exist to earn points through use of different cards and houses.  Much better than Pillars of the Earth in my book but I'd rather play Agricola and I will not be buying this game.  Probably more inviting and easier to play for people new to games within the worker placement genre.  Ignore cards at your own peril - you will lose.  I'll play, but I won't be asking to play.  The dice cup stinks to high heaven - do not care for that smell at all!

I really like and enjoy playing Stone Age. It's not too complicated, I would say light and ideal as a gateway game. The design of the board, the components and especially the dice cup sell the theme. Although my son isn't nearly old enough to play this game, I can imagine that it would be an ideal family game that could even help children practice their devisions and multiplication tables. 

Essentially its a worker placement game where you send your tribe of hunter gatherers to find or produce resources. However, you have to throw a die for each worker you send to a location to determine how much of the resource they've produced. There is some element of luck, but by producing tools you can mitigate the effects of a poor die role. 

As I said, I really enjoy playing it, but only as a 2 player game. Once I played this with four people and it took forever. It almost put me off the game in its entirety. There is way too much down time when the action phase is resolved. So a great game for 2 (or maybe 3 players), but it outstays its welcome with four.

05/2015 Rated it an 8/10.
08/2015 After a very long four player game I adjusted the rating to 7,5/10.

RATING: 6
A játék szép, ráadásul hiába komplex, kifejezetten könnyen tanulható: az első játék felénél már mindenki tökéletesen ismer minden játékszabályt, és az olyan szépségekkel foglalkozhat, mint az előre tervezés, stratégiázás.

Részemről örülnék, ha egy kicsit hosszabb lenne. Hárman játszottunk, és amiatt lett vége, hogy elfogyott az egyik kupac épület. Több játékos esetén még hamarabb elfogyhatna, azaz még kevesebb kör alatt, két játékosnál viszont talán kicsit hosszabb lenne a játék. Az épületekből 7 kör garantált, de akár több is lehet, ha nem szerez meg valaki minden körben ugyanazon épületkupacból egyet.

Szerencsejáték, igen, de valószínűleg mindenki hasonló arányban dob jókat és rosszakat, szóval annyira nem vészes. Inkább csak könnyedebb, lazább lesz tőle a játék: lehet kicsit bosszankodni, ha rosszakat dobunk, illetve örömködni, ha több hatos is sikeredik. Nem szabad véresen komolyan venni, és akkor nincs gond, ráadásul a témához is illik a szerencsefüggőség, hiszen valóban szerencsefüggő például a vadászsiker, vagy hogy mennyi aranyat sikerül a folyóból kinyerni.

A játék kellemes, a többiekre nem kell túl sokat várni, az interakció mértéke átlagos: jobb szeretem ha direktben lehet a másikkal gonoszkodni a saját érdekemben, de azért elég nagy a többiekre hatás is. Ez ugye főleg azon múlik, hogy az elején a többiek elől elfoglaljam a legjobb helyeket (eszközkészítés, földművelés), később pedig az épületeket és a civilizáció-lapokat. (A kezdőjátékos körönkénti változása ezt elég jól kiegyensúlyozza, bár minél több a játékos, annál kevésbé, de ez nem vészes negatívum.) Szóval ez indirekt egymásra hatás, ami ugyan nem az igazi, de legalább nem teljesen passziánsz.

A játék könnyű és jó, kiegyensúlyozott is a kockák ellenére, és lazán hozzáállva igen kellemessé tud válni. A győzelemhez több út is vezet, bár a sok épület és az épületenként három pontot adó civilizáció-lap túl erős kombónak tűnik.

Akarok még vele játszani, de így az első játék után nem érzem azt, hogy ezt mindenképp szeretném megvásárolni. örülnék neki, ha megvenném, játszanék is vele, de nem kihagyhatatlan darab.

Stone Age is a solid worker placement game that has just enough strategy so that gamers can enjoy but also enough luck (dice rolling and cards available) that it does not punish new players that much. The game is fairly easy to explain as you can divide the actions into four primary groups (resource collection, village spaces, hut building, or card purchase). One thing to note is most new players do not fully appreciate how valuable the card bonuses are. I would say that is the hardest part to teach as it is confusing to explain. This is one of my sister's favorites which surprised me because she is not a big fan of other worker placement games (aka Agricola).

Convinced me that Euro games aren't crap. My first buy before Endeavor and thanks to it I keep and eye on economic games. A great way to start a gaming session. A light euro game which has all the elements of a heavy euro game distilled down to the basics. I love it.

[update] 6+ months, I still love this game. I play heavy's like Le Havre now but I STILL want to bring this game out. Great game, couldn't recommend it enough.

[update]And SOLD simply because we have played it to death. I'll always be grateful to the game for introducing me to Euros.

Tons of fun here. Great looking components and easy to pick up rules have this as a favorite of mine as a middle weight gateway game. Does have a lot of similarities to Pillars of the Earth but the luck in this game just feels better. Sure a bad die roll can hurt but you can minimize the luck factor with playing safe and putting a minimum number of workers on spaces to offset this. Usually no one to blame but yourself if you don't get at least one good from an area you went to. I expect this one will see a lot of playtime this year.

A good worker placement game. Dice determine how many of each resource you can earn, rolling one dice per worker placed in an area. You can score points by building huts, or collecting "advancement" cards.

I really really like this game - it is less brain buring than Agricola but still challenging enough for the gamer in me.  Will pick this up at some stage as the children should be able to learn it relatively soon - however at present most people (gamers) I know seem to own it.

RATING: 8
Agricola "lite", with a pinch of Power Grid, a midgen of Carcassonne and some Yahtzee thrown in for good measure. It's easy to learn (for a WP) and has just enough of a luck factor, with the dice rolls for resource production, to keep the more casual gaming crowd interested. Very good production values in the RGG edition; the rawhide dice cup and natural wood dice are a nice touch.

Finally I found a game similar to Catan but heaps more fun than it. In Catan, you roll dice for resources and then use said resources to buy points. In Stone Age, you use workers to gather resources and then use dice based on amount of workers placed to see how much resources you get! There will be blockage happening but there is always something else to do and the starting player rotates each round as well. All in all, I believe that this is a more fun game than Catan to teach new players.

Bought this on Faye's recommendation and so far it's one of the best in our collection. I love the resource management and it has a very good balance of luck and strategy. It's the first game we break out with friends who aren't used to longer, strategy-based games. They always balk during the long rules explanation phase but afterward they invariably confess to having a great time with it. I like that it's never quite clear who the winner will be until all the final victory points are totaled.

To be frank, I expected to dislike this one. It combines a pair of trendy ideas in Euros – worker placement-based resource management and nouveau dice-rolling – that have not succeeded in converting me yet (although Macao shows promise on the latter front). Amazingly, Stone Age works for me, although it doesn't rock my socks off.

The reasons why this game has succeeded where so many popular predecessors – on the one hand, Caylus, Pillars of the Earth and Leonardo daVinci, on the other, To Court the King and Kingsburg – have failed are numerous and interrelated:

   1. It is a well-developed, polished design. So many of Stone Age's near-contemporaries – including the major worker placement games – have rough edges and quirky rules that feel unnecessary. Bernd Brunnhofer, the designer of Stone Age and lead developer at Hans im Glück, has a lot of experience at ruthlessly cleaning these sorts of games up, and his experience shows here. Even though there are several subsystems at play, Stone Age plays effortlessly and, except for a few of the symbols used to keep the game language-independent, the learning curve for Stone Age's rules is about three rounds (and a game lasts several times that). By comparison, Caylus is a rattling clunker.
   2. As a true middleweight, it doesn't feel as bad getting hosed by luck once or twice a game. Compare, if you will, with Ra, where you are sure to see a "perfect" lot ruined by an awful tile draw before you can do anything about it a couple times a game, not to mention the end-of-epoch drawfests. Here, a card you want will sometimes come up at an awkward moment, and you will get hosed by the dice a few times. Each action is such a small part of the game, though, so you can normally take it in stride, and make up for it later.
   3. The Civilization cards add an element of strategy that so many worker placement games – even Leonardo daVinci – sorely lack. While it is not on par with Princes of Florence or Race for the Galaxy in this regard, they differentiate positions enough to add replayability. They also serve to make the player interaction less about getting to the good stuff first than it is in most worker placement games.
   4. The dice make resource collection more interesting than slapping a guy down on the appropriate space, which I find dull. Instead, Stone Age offers a cross between risk-management and resource management. Can I get away with one less guy on the river so I can claim another building? Will four men get me enough pips to feed all of my workers? The decisions are meaningful and can be quite tough. The price of two or three really bad rolls out of 30 or 40 in a game is worth it for me.
   5. You get to choose the order in which you execute your actions, instead of following a game-designated script. This should be a minor point, but it feels like it makes a world of difference. It gives you flexibility when planning out your turn, and it lets you adapt to the unexpected. Ultimately, one of Caylus's "great innovations" (the road) was a stultifying straightjacket, and it took Brunnhofer to show it.


Stone Age is not the best game ever to come down the pike. The dice do what dice do, Central Limit Theorem be damned, and, except for the times when a card comes up that duplicates them, the actions in the village area of the board are too clearly better than the other actions at the start of the game for my taste. It's good enough to happily play it any time I am asked, even if it is not a typical HiG big box game.

Perhaps suffers from the fact that I like to play heavier games now. However, I think I like Lords of Waterdeep more because while Stone Age does have buildings and cards come up in different order, Lords has not only different buildings but also the actual Lords themselves which makes you go after different quests. Also Stone Age makes it too obvious that you are going for set collection, which really abstracts the theme. The dice rolls for the resources with mitigation with the tools I could take or leave. I do like that you can get more workers though at the expense of greater upkeep. Overall a good introductory worker placement, but definitely nothing mind blowing.

simple work placement game. I only played a 2 player game once, and it felt quite repetitive . We need to add and divide each round, so there are lots of bookkeeping. The final scoring is also quite troublesome. I think i need more play to evaluate it fully

Don’t get me wrong. I like Stone Age. But I don’t get why people like it more than many other worker placement games. It’s not really a good gateway game for me because I think that an experienced player will demolish a new person every time, which is what happened to me the first several times I played it. I win almost every time I play now because I’ve mostly figured out the balance between boats and buildings. I absolutely demolish the app API at its hardest setting every time I play.

UPDATE: I think I've reached the point that the game is semi-solved, and I don't like being able to mathematically model a game in my head while I'm playing it.

One of my favorite games. Can be played both very competitively and very casually. The game offers various ways in which you can piss off the other players, but it also offers various ways to play it by minding only your own business. The starvation strategy can, possibly, spoil the game to some extent and that's definitely a flaw in my opinion. However, this game has given me and my friend hours and hours of fun and you can't really argue with that. After all, that's the point of game, at least to me.

This is a typical strategy and management game. Build up your tribe and become the biggest one. This game is a fun game and easy to learn. Children could use some help with the resource-management and strategic point of the game. I played it several times now with family and friends and every time we have a lot of fun. 
The strategic needed in this game is low. It is relative easy to get the stuff you need to grow. It doesn't mean you can not loose.

Enjoyable for the family.

An OK game in the line of Pillars of The Earth and other worker placement mecanism (Caylus Magna Carta). It plays quickly and managing the risk in dice rolling is fun BUT I can't stop to think the game is a bit flawed. It seems that for the first 5-7 turns, the turn order is always: 1- Hut (to make babies) 2- Farm. There is almost never a better choice. I find it strange that a game like that seems almost scripted. In the end the game is a bit bland for me even though the components are REALLY good. In fact I used the clay, the wood and the rock in my agricola set!

I had been thinking about buying a lighter worker placement game, for those times when all of Agricola or Caylus are not what is wanted. Having dithered over Egizia and this for a while, I ended up plumping for the cavemen over the Egyptians. It helped it was just sitting there in my FLGS waiting for me.

It serves its purpose admirably. The basic scheme is collect resources and turn them into points, with the added wrinkle of feeding everyone and decisions over expanding your capacity to gather via tools or simply more villagers. I was slightly worried that the dice rolling would sour things, but quite the reverse - they give it that little buzz of excitement that dice rolling always gives but the game is straightforward enough and laid out well enough that you usually are going to get something even with a relatively poor roll (unless you are gambling on a single worker to get you gold). Indeed, I found it quite relaxing to play but with enough to think about that I wasn't bored. That is also from only one play - we'll see if I still say that in a year.

If there's a "classic Euro" I feel like I'm done with, this is it.  Liked it a lot at first, but the appeal slowly drained away.  The games just felt the same.  The discovery of the starvation strategy is what sealed the deal for me, however.  Whenever someone employs it, it all but ruins the game for me.  The great production values and its fundamental accessibility may be its saving graces, but if I never played it again, it'd be no tragedy.

We like Lords of Waterdeep better.  This game's strategy seems weird.  We probably need to play it a bit more, but is seems all about getting the cards.  And starving your people, which is very un-thematic.

Stone age is a simple and forgiving feed-your-workers euro. It's a great game. Easy to learn -- given a couple of useful hints, new players (including non-gamers) can have fun with this game in the first play.

After more than 30 plays, the simplicity starts making this game less interesting.

The title has it right--this game takes Euros back to the stone age.  Reimplementation of worker placement mechanics with the introduction of dice.  Bland, pasted on theme that starts peeling off as you play (starvation strategy?!?).  Another Eurogame with solid mechanics, but stays too long on the table, and otherwise fails to stand out from the crowd.  It is interesting that dice seem to be the latest trend in Euros--I think Airships and Kingsburg incorporated them much better.  If there weren't so many other great choices, I'd likely rank this higher.  Given that there are, I probably should rank it lower.

Could you possible develop a game that has less strategy and more randomness?  I doubt it.  

Game might be more fun if every one decides that the winner is determined by a single die roll at the beginning of the game and move on to a better game. "Was that the roll to see who goes first?  No, that was to decide who wins...congrats... well played!"

More fun than a trip to the dentist office, but only barely (Dentist office wins if they use gas).

I got kind of frustrated with this title sometimes. The dice rolling for resources made the process seem kind of arbitrary. Sometimes you send 3 guys to a resource and come back with hardly anything or nothing and someone else will send 1 worker and come back with arms full of stuff.

See my comments about Notre Dame for how this game fits into a learning path towards Puerto Rico and Caylus.

The game play and gorgeous board really pulls you into the theme.

NB: This game seems to be favored by a lot of folks over Agricola because it is shorter, lighter, less game pieces, less weight (physical and mental), less restrictions, more forgiving and overall scratches the same itch. I can easily see this being favored by younger players.

~ It looks great, which matters when you want to get new players to try it.

The more we play this the more we enjoy it! :o)
We were very wary of the dice at first - we do not like dice rolling to be the key to winning as it can easily make someone feel lost from the start after bad rolling.  However, it works very well in this game.  The idea of sending out your people to fetch resources and not knowing exactly how much they will return with makes sense thematically.  Sending out extra people and having tools on hand to adjust means you aren't entirely subject to luck!
Having secret points to add up at the end of the game often means we don't know who's actually winning which is all the better! ;o)
This gets played often and I'm sure it will continue to get played lots as it's pretty easy to teach and everyone seems to want a second game!

This game remains an elegant and appealing choice. High production values, coherent theme, quick and easy to play with choices to be made at every turn, many of which have an effect upon opposing players (by blocking them from performing the same action).

Fails to generate any excitment. I really don't care if I win this game or not.  Nothing wrong with the actual design though.

Update: Still don't get this game.  The only actual flaw is the fact that there are only 2 essential spaces to grab, so first and second player always take them for at least half the game.  If moves are no-brainers like this then there's something wrong with the design.  This also means that players later in the turn order are at a significant disadvantage.  Otherwise, it's an OK game that I just don't like.

This is one of my favorite dice rolling games.  It works extremely well with the theme (everyone likes to yell at there lazy workers when they only produce 1 wood between 3 of them).  It's also light and friendly enough to be considered a gateway game.

This game makes perfect use of dice. Lucky rolls can occur, but the strategy in the game is all about mitigating the luck factor and controlling the outcome. The artwork is stunning, and worth the price of admission alone. Probably the best medium-weight worker-placement game I've played.

The theme is not very well supported by the game mechanics (why do we buy huts with different resources?, what are the civilization cards?), plus several mechanics are quite gamey (why can only one player reproduce per turn?).

The game itself does not have major flaws and doesn't take too long, so I can get talked into it occasionally.

One of my total favorites - great worker placement game that requires a balance of gaining VP's with feeding your family (like a simpler version of Agricola).  Love this game.  One of the things I love about this game like other Days of Wonder games is that you can see [part of] your VP progress on the perimeter of the board as you're playing, but other VP's are hidden.  Don't love that the end game scoring is complex, so it takes a bit of work to compute (like 7 Wonders).

We got this after playing our daughter's version of Pillars of the Earth. I was shocked that two games could be so similar and thought a lawsuit should be coming along, but it wasn't. There are so many worker placement games out there, that I guess there is bound to be some overlap. We prefer this to Pillars, but there really is nothing special here. Oh... except the leather dice cup. Nice touch.

looks great, nice components, easy to learn but still a meaty game.

I have yet to come across another game that scratches this same itch.  worker placement, open feeling options, resource management, gateway game, it just has such a nice balance of all these little things and adds up to a great game.  I really want to find a very similar game just with a bit more depth/replay-ability.

I wish there was more complexity as far as they typical top three choices is getting a worker, going up on the food track, and getting a tool.  I've rarely seen those choices not be worth it until the last 2 rounds.

I played this one at a game convention some years ago and instantly loved this game. It might be a little nostalgia as it was the first game of its kind that I got to play. Yup, I was destroyed but I still liked the mechanic of it. I also enjoyed the theme of the game as well. Cave men or prehistoric man is not something I look for when it comes to a game but this one gave me a total tribe feel about it. I look forward into owning this one someday.

Really fun game!  I like the fact that you can start out by just playing to your own advantage, but then can grow into (a bit) deeper strategies, such as preventing your opponents from getting items that will help them with their own chosen paths to victory points.  Still a pretty light game, though.

Awesome production and thought went into the actual physical components too!  Wooden bits, nice art, thick card stock, and a leather dice cup!

Those who love Settlers may really enjoy trying Stone Age too.  Fresh new mechanics and game play, yet maintains elements of luck and dice rolling.

This is, in my opinion, THE game to own if you're looking to fill the "Light Worker-Placement" void in your collection.

RATING: 4
Wow, too much randomness to be fun for me.  Between the dice, the cards, the objectives... bleh.  

I don't enjoy games where multiple players race to be the first to complete an ever changing set of objectives.  I also feel like the graduated cost system of the cards doesn't work.  I feel like it should be a futures market, but from the midgame on, every round saw three of four (usually four) cards being purchased, so it was just random chance when the next cards came out as to which were expensive and which were cheap.  Not my kind of game.

10-29-11-This is another one that's just pure fun.  It's so great-looking and all the components are top notch.  It's also another one that you're often surprised to find out at the end who won.

RATING: 9.7
It's simple to teach, which makes it a great gateway game.

The components are beautiful, and the theme is prevalent throughout. My only complaint about the theme is that it feels like, if you can't feed your meeples, you should lose the number you can't feed (and have to get them back via the love shack) rather than losing 10 points. 

It plays well at every player count. I play games primarily two player, but my husband and I also get together once or twice a month with friends to play. Games that can handle two players well, but can also expand well to play four, are a treasure.

It has just the right amount of player interaction for my taste. You can take a space that someone else wants, but you can't destroy something they've been working for the past half of the game to build. We like player interaction that doesn't feel "mean" and Stone Age provides just the right level of player interaction for us. 

Beyond that, I just enjoy the worker placement mechanic. Games where I can gather and build things really appeal to me.

I expect this game will stay in our collection permanently for those reasons.

(Also own Stone Age: The Expansion.)

Outstanding theme, nice bits and art.  I don't mind the rolling for resources - it evens out over time, and you'll have the opportunity to savor a victory over your opponents AND the dice.  You'll also benefit from some incredibly lucky rolls every now and then.  :-)

The one theme-breaker is the viability of the "starvation" strategy.  I don't mind adjusting my play and trying to modify my tactics to make life harder on the player who tries it, but if someone suggested a houserule where starved people can't work - or perish (*leave the tribe* if you prefer a euphemism) - I wouldn't object.

I have the 2nd edition (with the box that better contains the components).  What is up with the smelly dice cup?  :-)

A little harsh, but the lack of "every game is different" factors are disappointing (think Agricola's hand of 7), and also resources don't feel different enough (you take equal effort to get 6 wood/3 gold, and those give you equal points when building buildings). The dice can also really screw you up - I prefer the "know your dice first" mechanic of Kingsburg and Alien Frontiers. Finally, there's little sense of progress since the "engine" in this game is pretty lackluster.

RATING: 8
There are a lot of moving parts, interactions, and icons to learn on the first play, and it comes off as a bit dense, but on play two everything was clear, smooth, and fun. It's a great mix of picking a strategy or two and sticking to it plus needing to be opportunistic -- and knowing when to take a gamble on something.

The way Stone Age uses dice is quite clever. I guessed "Pillars of Kingsburg" after hearing the initial description, but that's not quite right. The game manages chance very well, and you have a lot of control over how your die rolls actually turn out.

Very pretty board, interesting interactions and choices every round. The "power three" (farm, fuck, tool) are usually the optimal choices, in that order -- but not always. Knowing when they're sub-optimal can be hard to determine, and makes for some enjoyable tension.

After two plays, this shot up from a 6 to a 9 for me -- it's a great game.

RATING: 9
This game is a lot of fun to play, not to mention the art work is very well done. It was highly recommended at our local game shop. Some of the mechanics incorporate popular concepts of other Euro games, like Settlers of Catan, Puerto Rico, Carcassonne, etc. So in my opinion the game play is fairly solid. The game is refreshing in that you not only have to keep your guys alive but depending on what resources you go for to purchase huts or cards, the winner is kept secret until the end of the game when all the Victory Points are totaled. Strategy wise, there are a lot of options. I like to build up my food chain and tools as quickly as possible. From there building a healthy supply of wood (cheapest resource) will help you get the cards, which pays off big in the end. Entertaining wise - we'll we've played the game every night since we bought it. We're teaching our kids how to play and will introduce it to our circle of gaming friends. I would recommend this game to anyone - though you'll probably need to pick up a few extra "substitute" game pieces as we tend to run out regularly.

Easily the best light-medium WP I have ever played.

Update: As of 3/17/13, I have probably played this game 15 times. I just don't know what to say. It's obviously dice-driven, but since you can minimize the randomness (tools and worker allocation), Stone Age actually becomes quite mathematical. That is, you are constantly weighing the odds. I absolutely adore this game and I think every gamer should have it in their collection! 

I've recently purchased the iOS version for my iPad. It's good if you are fine with playing against AI, but the online multiplayer is not up to snuff. Carcassonne and Ticket to Ride are truly the gold standard for iOS, but neither can compete with Stone Age as a game.  

Update 7/14/14: Until tonight, I hadn't played Stone Age in over a year. It was great to get this gem back to the table! I absolutely LOVE this game. Admittedly, if I didn't really enjoy worker placement, I don't know if this game would be in my top 25, let alone my top 10. I do believe that anyone can play and enjoy this game. BUT, in order for it to be a favorite, I think you have to enjoy worker placement. After playing tonight, I realized why I like the game so much: it is perhaps the most streamlined example of worker placement out there. This game distills the mechanic so well! It's super smooth and turns are a breeze. Stone Age, at least 2 player, can also be easily played in 45 minutes or less if both parties know what they are doing. All that said, I'm dropping this game down a couple of notches. It's still a "10" for me, because it's perfect for what it does, has great components/art, is a solid gateway game for muggles, and it's really quick. Ironically though, it's the simplicity of this game that pulls it down ever so slightly. Don't get me wrong, you have interesting choices to make almost every turn, but unfortunately, those options are severely limited. Plus, the first few turns are rather scripted. Your best first move for the first 3 turns or so is moving up on the food track. Experienced players are literally just trading off for this position through changing turn order. This is unfortunate, but the good things about this game overshadow its shortcomings so considerably that I'm willing to overlook it. I will never refuse a game of Stone Age, and I will often recommend it. Still, it has (after 24 plays) sadly dropped from my #2 game to the lower portion of my top 5. 

Update 8/23/15:

I had so much fun playing this with my wife yesterday. We hadn't played in quite a while, and I was itching to get a session in. Stone Age was one of the first gateway plus games that I purchased after I plunged into the euro-gaming hobby (back in late 2012). I wasn't certain that it would hold up against some of the newer games (I've probably played at least 300 games in the interim). I'm happy to report that this game is still FANTASTIC. It really is the king of all worker placement games, IMO.

2 / 5 - Fair.

The great thing about Stone Age is the way it balances everything: there's no one dominant strategy or path to victory and the game rewards flexibility and good tactical thinking. So it's rather a shame that that's pretty much all I found to like about it. The theme is very silly (metals? In a game called Stone Age? sheesh), interaction is low and the mechanics tired and uninteresting. It reminded me a lot of Yspahan - and I'd much rather play Yspahan since it offers very much the same experience in half the time.

Received July 2008

Fast paced romp with multiple paths to victory. You can block the hell out of other players options during worker placement.

Includes dice as a randomizer accomplishing the same need as that found in Thebes.  As you do with knowledge when digging in Thebes, you work to increase your chances of success but putting more cavemen in an area and then roll the number of dice equal to the number of committed workers.  Also, collecting and using "tools" can alleviate some of the pain of a bad rolls as they allow you to adjust the roll of the dice.

Easy to learn (only three simple steps on each turn).  Took a bit for some of the guys in my group to catch onto the iconography but in general it's pretty consistent and straightforward.

Had to cut slots into the insert to lower the individual player boards which allows the box to close properly.

Strong game.  Easy to learn, but plenty of strategy options to keep it fresh for a LONG time.  Everything in the game, from board to pieces are very well made and have excellent attention to detail.  Probably one of the best looking games I've ever played.  The only thing that will be a drawback for some is the dice rolling for food and resources.  Sometimes you can get really bad rolls, which can be frustrating, but there ARE ways to control it to a certain extent.  For me, leaning more to strategy, it's a bit of a negative, but it's managable by playing smart.  Plays fast and easy with 2 people, making it an excellent filler game till others show up, then becomes a solid one of the main games for the night.

It's a pretty random worker placement game where the best you can really do is not make a big mistake, just put yourself in contention for the win and hope the luck goes your way. Still, if you're prepared for that it's quite a pleasant game. I've thouroughly enjoyed every playing. It can go a bit long for the level of randomness so be sure to keep it moving.

I would like to give this game a higher review, but it really left me flat.  The key element lacking was drama.  None of the choices seemed all that important to me.  The game choices were mostly clear once you understood the game.  At the end, you tallied up the points to see who won, but it didn't seem all that important.

The best thing about this game is that it is simple to learn and there is no direct conflict.  That makes it an excellent family game for the geek inclined family.  There's no complaining that one child attacked another or ganged up to prevent one player from winning.

I got this game for Christmas and have played it a ton. I read through the good and bad reviews on here and am surprised by both. 

the bad reviews usually base on 3 things: comparison to another game, complaints about dice, and complain about scripted strategy. I can't comment on PotE as I don't have it. As for dice (which some people also put in as pro), they don't really have much effect. What? Really. Since resources require 3,4,5 and 6 being off 1 or 2 isn't the deal breaker each turn. true, you can get supremely unlucky every single turn, but the reality is that doesn't happen as often as people like to think (the victim mentality). 

Also, it is not scripted and people will not go after the same things necessarily. The changing order turn, the changing cards and blocking lead to different strategies. Since some have complained about lack of interaction, I can only imagine they do not understand blocking - both at the woodpile and the civ cards. Also, you have to plan out how to use all the resources you gather over the next 3 turns, or you find the game has ended and you have a bunch of resources left over which is not as good as having bought huts instead. 

The limited availability of the tools, baby and farm are important, and thus strategy and blocking. Can't explain it all here, but I can say because of all of this, SA is a fantastic game. And it does play in 60minutes if you know what you're doing. The dice are not horrid, and the tools help there too. The design and parts are great and you can explain it easily enough to most people. The depth is there, you just need to play more. 

Edit: Since this review I have obtained PotE and can say SA is better for 2 reasons: 1) time; 2) order mechanic for Pillars sucks. 

Also, SA is a nice gateway game – fun, fast, easy to teach. While I don’t think strategy is scripted I do think options are limited and after a ton of plays, it starts to get boring. And now that Lords of Waterdeep is out, that is a nice replacement. As such, my rating drops half a point, but this is s still an overall great game and great value.

Much deeper than those who dismiss it as a game of luck quickly will ever know. It is very difficult to win against a more experienced player, even if one is lucky with the rolls. Since nearly every game is different it is still very good fun for me after more than 100 games (live and on BSW).

I will play Stone Age any time it is available. It's a fun game where you are managing your caveman workers by sending them out to areas to bring back resources. The amount of resources brought back are determined by dice which are determined by the amount of workers you sent out. The resources are then used to build various things throughout the game.

Enjoyed this but not sure yet (4 plays - 3x2p, 1x3p) how cohesive it all really is. It feels "bitty" - like I'm doing lots of unrelated things - although that's probably just because I haven't played it enough yet. Rating likely to go up somewhat when I feel I "get" this but I doubt it will hit an 8. I'm not entirely sure what market it's aimed at - family games for gamer families? Bought (unplayed) at Australian Games Expo 2008 - I think it might go over well with the Bigster.

Very fun worker placement and one of my faves of my collection. The perfect weight for me and any non-gamers I force to play with me. I have taught this to a couple of others and after a round, everyone has caught on to the rules easily. Great theme that adds to the game and great components. One of the few that works nicely with only two players! Also, the rule book is wonderful; easy to understand, short, and coherent. I know some gamers complain about the hidden cards that can create a run away leader, however I think they add to the replayability of the game. Also, proper use of the cards does require a bit of planning to maximize your end score.

Arrived on 6th December 2017. 

2 player game:
First 3 plays we misplayed one important rule (we should place one or more workers on desired location and then switch turn). 4th time we played it correct way but it still wasn't feeling right. It is too easy to get food. If you have high enough farm level you don't even have to feed your people.

Remek játék. Jó téma, gyönyörű grafika, minőségi tartozékok, könnyű megtanulni a szabályokat, igazi családi játék. Tetszik, hogy a kockák használata miatt gyorsul a játék, nem olyan gondolkodós mint pl. egy Cuba vagy Agricola. Más típusú játék, de tetszik. Ajánlott!

A nice game. Good theme, beautiful artwork, quality components, easy to learn the rules, a true family game. I like the speedy gameplay because of the dice-use. It's not so deep and brain-burner like Cuba or Agricola. A different type of game, but I like it. Recommended!

Tentatively score, could go up or down.  One some level, I'm not sure how much I like worker placement games and/or more economic resource pushing games.  But I'll keep at it.

Score from an 8 down to a 7.  I'm getting to like this less (despite the few plays).  I don't like how perscriptive the strategies are (i.e. if your opponent does X you need to do Y).  It just isn't a very fluid or dynamic game.  Plus I find there is little arc or sense of progression over the course of the game.  It is quite flat feeling.

Will only trade for something high on my wishlist.

Rated after 1 play w. 4 players. Medium strategy game. Placement of workers defines resources and abilities. A little bit of randomness lies in rolling for resources; your not always guaranteed to get some. Cards can be purchased for bonuses at the end of the game.

RATING: 7
[i]Stone Age[/i] is my favorite of the worker placement/resource management games.  There are a variety of paths to victory that may be necessary to pursue depending on how your opponents play and in what order the civilization cards and buildings appear.

One of the aspects of the game that I most enjoy is that you do not have to use your workers in the order in which they are placed.  This allows you to strategically use workers to pull off valuable combinations.

The other aspect that I really enjoy, especially in the two-player variant, is that not all players may place workers in each region.  This allows for blocking opportunities and forces you to think ahead when placing your own workers.

**********

I have not necessarily soured on [i]Stone Age[/i], but having now played many other games, it is no longer my favorite worker placement game.  In particular, the lack of blocking in a 3-4 player game makes the game somewhat dull.  Also, the number of paths to victory is lower than in other games.  I would much rather play [i]Spyrium[/i] or [i]Viticulture[/i] at this point.

Yet another worker placement game. Competition for the best places to put them and some management of resources and turning those into points. And keep your population fed. All in all not much new here, but it plays away nicely. It is not very strategic or interactive. It is a pity that you don't how good or bad you and your opponents are doing during the game. So many bonusses at the end.

Agricola light it seems. Which means it gets to the table more often although Agricola is arguably the better game. I have many "light' games, Betrayal at House on the Hill is some sort of D&D Light, Letters from Whitechapel is some sort of Fury of Dracula Light etc. It just means i get to play it more often with non gamers and that to me is a big plus. Only dislike is the 10000 vp hidden score.

Terrific entry into the world of worker placement games.  This game is mechanically put together really well.  Experienced gamers can easily mop up against beginners, but the learning curve isn't steep at all.  After seeing those greedy moves,, they won't be fooled twice.

I like the ability to use tools to offset the randomness of dice rolling.  In end, the dice don't matter much.

RATING: 7
The game is simple to teach, short to play, very accessible for non-gamers. In addition it remains enjoyable after many plays and in groups of varied levels of experience.  The game has some mild player interaction and therefore provides different ways to victory that are balanced enough to make the game highly replayable despite its lightness. it plays well with two, and I have used it more than once to introduce new players to worker placement with good success.

All that said, the game is a very abstract-adjacent, minimalist worker-placement and while it is a great simple case study of the mechanic it does lack the razor edged perfection (thought it should be noted the game is balanced very well) that minimal designs need to hold player interest over time.

Basically well-executed worker placement game with slightly artificial theme. The mathematical mechanics is unsuccessfully masked behind pseudo-hidden information, resulting in requiring mental score-keeping to avoid unforeseeable final score tallying.

One play. Rating may rise. Had more fun with it than most action-placement games, but I still got a little antsy by the processional nature of the mechanic. The die rolling and cards added some much needed surprises for this type of game, and there are a few nice decision points where I had to shift into a different strategic mode as the game went on. More plays will show if I feel like I'm only trying to 'do the same sort of thing but just a little bit better' or if I feel like the game is an open and expansive experience.

I wasn't sure I really liked this game at first as there's a lot of luck involved with seemingly few ways that a player can mitigate it, but I've come to enjoy playing it every once in a while.  There are a lot of good gameplay aspects here: multiple paths to victory, strategic decision making, mystery about who will win, etc.  Unfortunately, the different strategies seem shallow and transparent, and the luck of the cards and turn order can sometimes play a significant role in determining the victor.  I rarely suggest this game as I'd rather play Kingsburg for a similar experience, but I'm usually willing to play if someone else proposes it.

Bit of a let down.  I was really expecting more with this game.  Rules were easy enough with the typical "what-the-heck-am-I-doing?" first few turns, but you get the gist of things pretty quickly.  Maybe it was the crew I played with, but we never reached any sense of real immersion.  It was all fairly mechanical, kind of dry, and frankly, not all that fun.

The better games have us talking afterward about what we would do next time, but this one just didn't leave us with a burning desire to play it again very soon.  Maybe I'll try it again with a different crowd some day.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is an ok game. After one play, I'm curious to play again but I don't think it would replace any other worker placement game. If Agricola or Caylus is up for play, this one would not see table time.

My problem with this game is the multiple paths of victory: so what? so I can place a dude and get a card that multiplies the number of points I get for workers? No real strategy is needed. The depth is shallow as there are always decent options to take.

Update: I played online and well, it's just as boring there, too. No real depth, no soul and no realized theme. My connection went down and I was booted out of the game; thank god for that.

Game in a Nutshell: Worker Placement game set in the stone age where you collect resources and use them to get cards and tiles that give you victory points.

Played as: 4 player (2 player online)

Pros: Rolling dice (relative to the number of workers you placed) for your resources adds a little spice in the form slight unpredictability. That said, dice don't dominate the game and careful planning should prevail. Lots of different ways to go for points so there's not a strict, "you must do this or get blown out of the game" path player must take. It scales well for 2-4 players. Attractive board and artwork.

Cons: It's a well designed game but nothing astonishingly unique. Perhaps the game is too balanced to the point that just about anything will score you points, resulting in a lack of consequential tension. I found the game to be somewhat mathematical: "this move will get me this many points, but that one will block X from that many points, so my best move is ___". That is especially apparent the less people playing.

Other: Essentially Stone Age is a lighter, more forgiving, and more accessible version of Agricola. I enjoyed this better of the two since it's less fiddly and levels the playing field for a group with different levels of experience.

Best Use: If you want one swiss-army knife worker placement game in your collection, this is it.

Whatta nice game, played it a lot. Alotta dice luck but a seasoned player would still wup a noob, but beginners luck could definitely level the playing field. Neat new play concepts like the dice roll lottery cards. Drenched with theme, you really feel like your going on a hunt or had a really bad gold panning haul when you roll 5 dice and only get 1 bar, I even got rid of those plastic bags that hold the unborn tribesman and replaced it with burlap pouches with a rope tightener. So light it floats, not for the heavy gamers.

I didn’t get Stone Age at first, but it’s grown on me.  It’s a relatively pure worker placement game with dice added.

I don’t mind dice and chance in my games, but they did seem a little out of place here. I’ve come to accept that the dice have a relatively minor effect, and that without them there might not be much of interest here as the game underneath is pretty dry and mathy.

There are several worker placement games I would rather play first, but Stone Age has its charm.

RATING: 3
1 play.  The graphic design of the game is beautiful but it bored my kneecaps off.  The board is a big beautiful place-holder, just a way to keep track of piles of stuff.  You don't really play any game on the board.  But I generally don't like games without at least some geometrical element.  I would wait til having played more to rate it, but I won't play it again unless coerced to do so.  

This is one of those games where my opinion could swing wildly with more experience, however. The best players appear to be incredibly good at this game. If I were to take the time to get skilled, it would probably feel like a completely different game, and my judgement would probably be quite different. 

However, I need more initial attraction to do that. I don't have it, so I won't do it.

Great game! Utilize your "meeples" to breed, build farms, collect tools, buy cards, or roll dice that allow you to collect food, resources, etc (yes, I did criticize dice rolling in the previous rating but here, there is more variety and you have more control). This game holds my interest because there are so many variables in strategy you can use such as deciding to collect the most symbols (which earn you exponentially more points for the number of symbols you have), or collect resources to build huts (each hut earns you points), or collect cards that multiply your score based on huts, fields, etc.
Takes about 20 minutes to explain. About medium in terms of difficulty. I don't think I'll burn out on this one.

Great game with many interesting choices each turn and many ways to collect points. Some people mention it as a good gateway game but I don't agree with them. Smart non-gamers I introduced it to found it too complicated and too long. They did appreciate it's depth but it will require few more games for them to even begin grasping the strategies required to play well. Good gateway games should be able to be grasped and played instantly.

Solid worker placement game of helping your stone age family survive. You send workers to grab resources/hunt for food, rolling dice for each worker to determine how much you get, you make tools to help mitigate your dice rolls, you work on agriculture to lower your hunting needs, visit the shack to grow your family and use your resources to buy cards and huts to score points.

Excellent; multi paths to victory and you need to both think ahead and keep an eye on what your opponents are up to. I have won (153pts) with a no tool 5 original meeples strategy, a heavy tools effort, seen a maxi meeple and mixed strategies all work. You must and can adapt to circumstances and it remains unclear who will triumph if all are up to speed. Fast, simple and superb.

Dropped a half point after a couple of dozen more plays (NB I don't generally log plays), because I don't feel there is real depth or much direct interaction.

Would this game be as fun without the leather cup?  NO.  Rolling dice in a leather cup > rolling dice any other way that I know of.

I enjoy the unofficial terminology my friends and I have developed for this game.

Stone Age doesn't have the best scoring paths in the world, but the choices are still appealing and I have a fun time playing.

The mechanics reminded me a lot of Pillars of the Earth, with some significant improvements: 
First, the huts give the game much more of an engine-building feel.  Pillars felt like you had almost nothing to work with from start to finish.
Second, the civ cards and buildings were much easier to grasp in terms of cost vs. benefits.
And third, the dice lighten the game up and add some fun.  Pillars was just too dry.

I like Euro games in general.
Caylus. Agricola. Alchemists.
when talking about a worker placement game luck should be avoided. Or it should be like in alchemists. The dice rolling for resources is just ... what s the word again? Downright stupid.
Boring!

Perfect worker placement game. Can't seem to get tired of this one.

The pacing of the game is the best in any game. The end can come at you pretty fast, but it's all player-driven so it's up to you to control it.
Really simple and fast worker placement, and then the collecting of the rewards.
Amazing scoring mechanisms (buildings vs. cards).
Excellent push-your-luck mechanisms when you want multiple things at the same time, but are unsure if an opponent will get the one you don't pick first.
Allowing only a few activations in the center area is a brilliant system

The expansion adds great new content and is really enjoyable. I would not say it's mandatory though. I vary playing with or without it, and it's always enjoyable.

[u]08-Feb-2013[/u]: This is a solid, family friendly entrance into the world of worker placement games.  Everyone starts out with a tribe of five prehistoric people who got out into the world to collect resources to improve their society with huts and civilization cards.  Yeah, it doesn't totally make sense, but it works very well in the game.  And as most worker placement games do, you can even increase the size of your family to get even more resources on your turn.  Of course, you do have to feed all of those people too.

I like this one quite a bit.  It's relatively light compared to some other worker placement games like Agricola and Caylus.  My family grasped the gameplay after only one play.  On the downside, our first several plays went fairly long.  We seem to be a slow group in general though.  So I actually removed one hut from each stack during set up as well as 10 of the Civ cards to help speed things up.  This helped a lot, but also left out some of the longer term strategy as the game ended a couple turns early.  Otherwise, a fun, light strategy game that I look forward to playing any time.

[u]26-Jan-2014[/u]:  Stone Age is still a fave of both myself and Mrs Mo.  The girls like it as well, but the shiny, new stuff usually distracts them from choosing this one.

It's an excellent lower-midweight Euro.  One that can be taught relatively quickly and easily.  The art and components are excellent.  It plays well at all player counts...even 1P using the SoloPlay rules.

I'd recommend this as solid family-style Euro and a good one for gamers not looking for a thinky game.

Oh, and just to follow up on my older comments, I've finally moved us back up to the full game setup the last couple time we played.  We are still slow as a group, but the games have been very fun.

An enjoyable game that plays very similarly to Pillars of the Earth.  I like the easy flow of the game, the quick decision making and even the excitement of the dice.  However, competitive players will find that the game does come with a couple of faults: first there's no balance for turn-order.  The obvious first choice is probably to create a new worker but only one person can create a worker per round.  This means that if you're third or fourth you're always going to be a worker behind the other players for a few turns.  Second, some of the VP point cards are unbalanced.  It would be fine if everyone had an equal chance to grab those cards but they don't.  It depends on when they come up and then once again turn order comes into play.  Whoever goes first that round can plop one of their workers on the superior card and lock it out.  Played with 3 players and thought it was about 30+ minutes too long.  I'm sure the 4-player version is much better, barring the flaws described above, as it will add more competition and harder choices.  UPDATE: I've played this quite a few more times and determined that the luck described above is negligible.  There are some chances to play defense and a number of different strategies.  Added 1 point to rating. UPDATE: this really does have solid replay value.  Adding another .5 to rating.

very solid worker placement game that uses dice interestingly.   3 player seems to work a bit better than 4.   

the more i play the more i realize that the 'luck factor' is far lower than one thinks initially.  the game gets dismissed by some critics on this without grasping what exactly is going on in the play.  as i play it more, i realize that critique is unjustified and this is a pretty neat game.

A light worker placement game. It's an okay game, but too simple for my taste, there is other worker placement games I would much rather play.

[url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/611784/gathering-at-its-finest]Stone Age Review: Gathering at its finest[/url]

I think this is by far my favorite worker placement game right now.  I would rather play this over Agricola any day.

In Stone Age each player begins with 5 meeples and some food to get started.  Each turn is played in a series of rounds.  The first round is for placing your meeples on the different actions available on the board.  You can go get resources, go get food, get more farms, more tools, go to the love hut and get another person, buy cards (mostly for points at the end of the game) or build some buildings that give you points for the resources you use to build them with.  After everybody has placed their meeples the starting player in the round resolves all the actions in the order needed.  So if they placed a meeple on a building, but still need a stone in order to build it, they could try and get that stone with the meeple(s) they placed to gather stone first.  After resolving actions you have to pay one food for each meeple you have.

The biggest reason I like this better than Agricola is because it has more ways to actually win.  While you can get blocked on what you need to do, it doesn't happen too often.  Also, while you need food, it isn't so difficult to get that you feel like all you are doing is getting food.

I think Stone Age is a game I'll play for a long time to come.  I really think it should have been the Spiel des Jahres winner for 2008.

Comments based on only one play.

When I think of VP engine games, Stone Age is near the top.  Nothing against VP engine eurogames, but it seems like the strategy choices are obvious, leaving this as a game primarily concerned with tactics, timing and second guessing your opponents (i.e. what option are they most likely to choose).  

Also, it is going to be quite difficult to win if your dice rolls are consistently trending below everyone else's at the table.

Not bad, but not great because it seems like the game has limited strategic choices.  I'll still play it, as I like rolling a bunch of dice.

I was pleasantly surprised how simple it was to learn the game, and even better, how enjoyable it is in 2 player mode -- the wife loves it, which is always a good thing.  While Ticket to Ride is the quintessential gateway game, this is exactly the kind of game I'd follow up with the "beginning" board gamer.  Deeper, more decisions, but not necessarily more complex.  And I'm kind of in love with this game.

A játékosok egy-egy kőkorszaki törzset irányítanak. A törzs tagjait küldik el minden körben vadászni, nyersanyagokat előállítani, vagy a falu különböző lehetőségeit kihasználni; ezután pedig a nyersanyagok felhasználásával kunyhó lapkákat és civilizáció kártyákat szerezhetnek meg, amik a győzelmi pontot jelentik a játékban.
Nagyon szép a kivitelezés, egyszerű szabályok, gyors szabálymagyarázat - és elég hosszú játékidő. Tetszik benne, hogy többféle lehetőség van a pontszerzésre: lehet kunyhókat építgetni, vagy a civilizációs kártyákkal különböző kombókat összehozni. 
Hiába tesz szert valaki a játék közben behozhatatlannak tűnő  előnyre a sok kunyhó felépítésével, a játék végi elszámolásnál a kártyák kiértékelésével minden megváltozik. A játékidő elég hosszú, de ez játék közben nem tűnik fel, az izgalom végig kitart. Vigyázat, a szerencsefaktor elég magas a kockák miatt!

Played once.  A nice resource-acquisition game that combines elements of many others (Caylus, Puerto Rico, Leonardo da Vinci), but it's a bit more luck heavy than most (as the number of resources you get by allocating workers is determined by the roll of dice).  Overall this is a neat game that I quite enjoyed playing, but the first game I played of this took more than three hours, which was a bit much considering that two of the four players felt out of the game for more than half that duration.

Worker placement game that uses a cool dice mechanic. I kinda wish I had purchased this instead of Kingsburg. I also kinda wish I had purchased this instead of Pillars Of The Earth. I guess you can say this is kinda like Pillars meets Kingsburg. Kinda.

Update: This is turning into something I like to have if playing with more casual gamers. It it's just me and Ali, I think we both enjoy something a little deeper like Le Havre or At the Gates of Loyang. That said, both those games take a lot longer, which can be tough.

After a couple of plays, it scratches the same itch as Agricola without feeling as overwhelming. 

I haven't lost to my wife yet. So far this is one of those games she likes but hasn't won. I find that buying a lot of cards is a good strategy. I'm good at maximizing my resources. And rolling dice in a little leather cup.

Update: I've lost to my wife.

Stone Age seems to be one of those games that I enjoy playing while I'm at the table with it, but I have no drive or desire to bring it out and play it. Too easy once you figure out what to do: focus on the cards and a few specific buildings. Mostly gather wood and buy cards.

A stupid worker placement. The dice add a nifty push-you-luck element that kept things interesting, but not interesting enough.

There was also never ENOUGH conflict. The game was almost TOO nice, if that makes sense. I hate to use the cliched term "multi-player-solitaire" but I never felt like I was actually competing with the other players, only playing in parallel.

I suspect it's relative lightness makes it more accessible than Agricola. Still, it's not the best of the worker placement genre. And the mechanics are so played out and overdone that it's hard to sit patiently through.

Played on BGA. Its fun, but wondering if other worker placement would be better. Also, wondering if this is a good one to introduce my wife to worker placement. I think she may enjoy this type of game, its the next evolution from Splendor, where its not direct conflict, but you have to take what the game/others give you to influence your decision making.

This game is considered as 'Agricola Light' for a lot of people and rightly so. There are a lot of similarities between both games and the joy to play the game is comparable. Stone Age does however play much faster and although there are less things to choose from in comparison to Agricola, there are more than enough decisions to be made to make it hard enough to win.

In comparison to Agricola, the dice do add some luck to the game but this can easily be minimized by pulling in more workers on a field or using the devices. It is also a perfect gateway game into more difficult worker placement games.

RATING: 5.5
Certainly not a bad game. Neat components, nice attempt to connect theme to abstract worker placement, fun in chugging dice.
But it's balanced so strangely!
Why don't buildings requiring particular goods give more points than buildings accepting anything, just a sum of the goods value?
Why isn't the set collection, certainly the hardest part of cards to get, worth most points? Why do I need to concentrate more on denying particular cards to opponents than what's best for me?
It could still be used as "intro to worker placement". But sadly it no longer deserves to be rated this high.

This game is lovely to look at and mehcanically very solid worker placement game. Recource collection includes lots of dice chucking but player can increase odds by placing many workers or using tools that increase dice values. I recommend this to be played with four players cause with less people game play feels a bit crippled. 

Stone Age has definitely earned its place in the collection. It is a classic.

Stone Age ist ein klassisches Worker-Placement Spiel. Allerdings greifen das unberauchte Steinzeit-Szenario, sowie alle Elemente des Spiel so passend und stimmig ineinander, dass es an Stone Age fast nichts auszusetzen gibt. Das Spielmaterial ist hochwertig und es ist erstaunlich viel in der Schachtel drin. Simuliert wird das Leben eines urzeitlichen Dorfes. Die Spieler müssen Holz hacken, Nahrung jagen oder Steine und Gold beschaffen. Doch jeder Arbeitsplatz bietet nur begrenzten Platz und so ist es wichtig zu planen, wo man seine Arbeiter einsetzen möchte. Von den erbeuteten Ressourcen, bauen die Spieler Gebäude oder Handeln, beides bringt Siegpunkte. Wer Worker-Placement mag, sllte Stone Age unbedingt eine Chance geben.

Stone Age is a "lighter" Pillars of the Earth, with less theme IMHO.  It takes worker placement from Caylus, Cuba, AOEIII and not least of all Pillars of the Earth, but correlates it to dice.  Like Pillars of the Earth and Cuba, the art work is some of the best in boardgaming.  I like this game more and more each time I play it.  Awards: Ludoteca Ideale (2010); Spiel der Herzen (2010).

RATING: 2
Heavy on worker placement and resource management.  For those that like this focus I'd imagine it is a decent light and quick game.  I don't mind these mechanics, but seek out games that have a tightly incorporated theme and a high degree of player interaction.  

There is very little meaningful player interaction in Stone Age.  I found that the Stone Age theme didn't sync with game play or the design.  Why are competing tribes exploiting the same locations for resources?  What are these mysterious boats that are arriving?  In what manner can these people eat bricks and wood?

Sections of the board within the village are entirely necessary in order to have a chance at competing and thus, in a four player game, fill up with workers prior to the 4th player's turn.  In contrast, there is little tension involved with placing workers in resource sections outside of the city because these typically have enough spots to fit all needs.  As a result, there is a predictable flow of worker placement, from village to huts to cards to resources.  Cards and huts are random and decrease the degree of strategy.  After placement, there is a period of time where each player completes there planned actions while others wait.  Because actions are already out there this part too lacks tension and is uninteresting.

**Update 2 years later 9/17/2015.  Dropped from 5 to 2 rating.  No theme, horrible luck-based/random elements for a worker placement euro, largely solitaire play, incredibly boring.  So many better alternatives out there.  Hope never to play this again.

Great production.  Unfortunately, I find it feels samey every game in the early rounds.  Plus, Stone Age made me realize I like having spatial aspects to my games (which it doesn't).  In Stone Age, I place people 1 round, then the next they can be anywhere, don't like that.

RATING: 7
Miles ahead of Pillars Of The Earth. There's no comparison. I never understood the random draw in Pillars or the awfully clunky card-drawing mechanism for resource generation. 

This one takes all the luck of Pillars of the Earth and repackages it into something that you can mitigate or control. It's more informed risk-taking than random chance, here.

In Pillars, it's just dumb luck if your master builders or resources don't come out when you want. In Stone Age, if you don't get what you want, it's 'cause you didn't allocate well.

RATING: 9.3
The quintessential gateway worker placement game.  Dice add a bit of randomness, but tools and placement options mitigate some of the luck.

A quick, simple and fun worker placement game. I like how the dice rolling has been worked into the resource collection mechanism while allowing players to offset the luck factor by investing in tools. Looks like a good gateway game, especially to other worker placement games. Although Stone Age is mechanically simple I think (after only 1 play) that there room to develop good strategy and make tough tactical choices. My rating will probably go up after a few more plays.

Update: After a few games of this, I find Stone Age is just going through the motions. Will play it if someone else desperately wants to play it.

Another worker placement game. To me this game is just a bit too repetitve when compared to Le Havre.

After a second play I now know that the runtime of this game and the repetitive nature of the play makes this game not one that I would choose to play again. It is far too long to be doing the same things over and over and over again. Hawaii shows just how things can be done quickly and more interestingly changing the constant food demands for VP gains...... A carrot will always be better than a stick!

Sold off to my club to get a newer copy with the larger box size.

This dice allocation Euro is pretty neat. It does nothing brilliantly well as it is a fairly standard 'allocate workers...gain resources and spend them on VP earners' kind of game.

But it is beautifully balanced in relation to the avenues to victory and it scales perfectly for 2, 3 or 4 players.

It's not quite up to Kingsburg's level but it is a quality Dice Euro.

Update 8/2010:
Got a chance to try this game again.  Even though I still think Pillars of the Earth is a better game, it's only by a slight margin.  This is a fun and enjoyable game.
***

This is a good game with a nice theme that is fun, but a bit to repetetive and predictable for me.

I've only played it once, but that was enough to know that it is NOT better than Pillars of the Earth.  Lighter yes, better NO.

I found the whole dice rolling aspect tedious.  Also adds to game length.  There is no way that this is a 60 minute game with 4 people.  Takes at least 90 minutes.  And if I'm going to invest that kind of time in a game it will be playing Pillars of the Earth, where your actions are less mechanical and you have some real tough decisions and unknowns to deal with.

Stone Age is an inherently good game, but the problem is, Lords of Waterdeep exists. Aside from being language independent, this has nothing going for it in comparison. Unless you really like dice, that is. The game's only form of progression is with agriculture and tools, making it easier to feed your people and get resources. Otherwise it's a very static experience that goes on way too long. The whole mechanism involving feeding your people feels really unnecessary, and I think had it been left out, this game would actually be a decent length instead of going about 45 minutes too long. So in effect, the game amounts to who can gather resources and build stuff fastest. This is a perfect example of how flawed worker placement games tend to be.

I just ordered this and I can't wait.  This game will probably end up being game of the year for 2008.  I reminds me a lot of Caylus, a working mans version of this.  While Caylus is for sure a very deep, heavy gamers game, Stone age is more of a family game.

This game has got so many thing going for it.  There is set collection of the cards, building hut collection, placing workers (like in caylus) and resource management.The beauty of the game is what to do with your 5 meeples?  Do you make babies?  Invest in tooling?  Plant crops?  Hunt?  Collect stone, clay, wood, or gold?  Build huts?  Or grab Civilization cards?

The game ending condition is great.  Its triggered by either not being able to replenish civilization cards on the board or playing the last hut.  From there your victory points get added to the game ending multipliers of the huts, tools, meeples, civ cards (both tan and green).  

What I love about it is that even if there is a runaway leader, someone can come from behind and steal the victory, as you really never know who is leading or winning, until the final tally. And thats what will give this game a high replay factor.  In playing (on BrettSpielWelt) I never feel like I'm doing bad, but always deciding on where to place my meeples next. I feels like the victory points are almost an after thought.

The game components and board artwork is just awsome.  

For some reason to me, this game kinda feels like Yspahan too as well.  Not sure why, maybe its the dice or the individual boards for each player.

Speaking of dice, thats were the tools come in handy.  Rolled a 4, but need a 5, just use one of your tools.  And yes it has dice, but I feel that they are used very wisely.  I don't think someone with a hot hand would make or break you out of a win.  Its more strategy then luck of the dice.

I see that there is a solitare varient for this, which I will try.  You play by yourself with tweaked rules, and try to score 300 points.  

If you like Yspahan or Caylus, this is a game for you.  You will not be dissapointed at all.

After 3 plays with 2 players, I see a few things happening:

1) Scores keep going up.  The 3rd game was 300 something to 200 something.  We used up almost the entire Civilization deck and almost every building.  Agriculture was pegged to the top.

There just didn't seem like a strong enough game clock to keep the game short, and so we both optimized and maximized scores.

2) There seems to be an optimal 1st-3rd worker placement.  Agriculture.  Another town option, if available, for your second pick, else a competed-for purchase or wood cutting.  Then everything else. The only exceptions were for sweet Civilization cards that had appeared before the turn, like a 2x shaman or 3x builder card that would pay out 20+ points for between 1 and 4 wood.  

3) Wood is king.  Civilization cards are the meat of the scoring, and they can be purchased with wood, which is easily obtainable.

After 15 plays, I am certain that this one ranks up there with the best!!  So many ways to play....even have won with a starving caveman strategy!!

I will look to downgrade Caylus one more notch for sure after this.....

Along with Kingsburg, Stone Age is probably the best gateway game out there, but, in my opinion, the replayability factor doesn't hurt SA so much as it hurts KB longevity with a gaming group. The luck factor may turn off some players, but it still retains a lot of positive aspects to encourage new plays. And the gameboard is a masterpiece.

Better than pillars of the Earth.  A wonderfully manufactured game with cute little decisions and random fun in production.  I don't know how the replayability will last but I think this would get quarterly play at least.  I suggest it would scale well too.

RATING: 9
This gem of a game is simple to learn and teach, and plays great with 2 through 4 players. The turn structure is relatively simple, but the multitude of options provides great strategic depth. Yes it is a dice game, but the luck factor is mitigated by well calculated play. Decision making is usually quite effortless, and the flow of the game is rarely interrupted. The only downside I see is the amount of maths that must be performed after each dice roll. The arithmetic is by no means taxing, but over the course of a whole game it can become a bit tiring. Still, with great artwork and high quality components, Stone Age provides a delightful gaming experience that should not be passed up. Oh, and the leather dice cup makes it!

RATING: 7.5
Overall Comments: Stone Age is a dice-rolling game to be sure.  A game which rewards those who can estimate the values of the game elements quickly and be able to place their "people" effectively.  As a family game it works really well because of the randomization of the dice and the fun-factor that comes with the "gambling".  This game plays quick and has few rules to bog down the game.

Ratings:
Initial(wow factor):9 (all of the parts look and feel good, the parts don't fit in the box though even after popping out the components)
Family: 10 (the light dice rolling has been the reason that it is getting played - an 8 year old can grasp the concept quickly)
Game Group: N/A (not played yet and may be a tough sell due to the random elements)
AP: 10 (really no slowdown, it plays quick)
Solo play: In development (working to eliminate the randomness and increase the strategy elements)

Purchased: 2008
Luck factor (1-10high): 8 (continuous dice rolling which is softened slightly by odds analysis, cards/huts come up randomly)
Recommend expansions: N/A
Age range: 6+ (yes, even the young can get this one)

Reason purchased: Geek reviews and months of culling the strategic aspects of the game, I don't like dice games but there is a need for another gateway game and this seemed to be it.

Pros: plays quick, no AP, simple to understand, interesting if simple gameplay, components look great
Cons: dice rolling, simplicity (a strength and a weekness), replayability, seems to offer up the same challenge each time

Recommendation: I would put this game in with Settlers for the light play and the randomness of getting material.  You can control the material you get a little better in this game than Settlers which makes it less likely that you would get stuck waiting for ???. This is a gateway game that a family can get into and makes a good filler game for the serious gamer.
Replay rating: Moderate
Game value(plays/game cost ratio): Average (I can't play this one too much or it starts to feel stale)

RATING: 6.5
In the stone age, place workers to gather tools, reproduce, hunt for food, acquire four different kinds of resources, get civilization cards or convert goods to VPs through buildings. On the food and resource gathering, dice are rolled to determine how much you get, with tools adding modifiers to the dice rolls. The civilization cards offer you different strateges to try, such as getting multipliers on people, food, tools or buildings. The cards also give diversity bonuses as well. 

It's a fun and engaging game. The dice factor does introduce an element of luck, and being a worker placement game, it is possible to deny people some crucial spots, which could lead to  kingmaking possibilities.  I would classify it as a light worker placement game.

Just a few plays in, but I'm really enjoying this.  Not a truly deep game, but an enjoyable one with lots of things to choose and do.  I generally hate dice games, but dice just fit well with this game.  I also like how hard it is to know who is winning, so there's no king-making.  As much as I like Age Of Empires III, I find this one more relaxing and enjoyable in a lot of ways - less concern with screwing up with one mistake.  Good game!

There is nothing *wrong* with Stone Age, but it sits at an awkward position for me.

Although often suggested as an entry-level worker placement game, randomness from dice and slightly opaque scoring rules mean that I have other games that would always be pulled off my shelf first.

Starvation strategy should probably be mentioned too. It's a common point of discussion of course, and while doesn't "break" the game it's a fairly obvious strategy that doesn't do the game any favors...

Stone Age is a light worker placement game. It runs a little long, and all players are basically doing the same things, but it is a good gateway for this type of game. It has beautiful artwork and a neat little leather dice cup (that unfortunately should be kept in an airtight bag).

It does have a roll-for-success mechanic for resource acquisition, which I would detest if it weren't for the fact that players can adjust their rolls with tools that they develop over the course of the game. With good enough tools its possible for almost every roll to be a success, but you have to work to develop the tools first.

Scores in this game skyrocket well passed the end of the victory track (100) and can even lap the board twice. There should be some kind of marker to denote 100+/200+ points, but as the majority of the victory points are gained in the endgame tally it isn't too difficult to keep track of them.

Unfortunately, endgame point scoring is heavily biased towards the Civilization cards, meaning that anyone who didn't devote themselves to acquiring them over the course of the game will find their score sorely lacking. This single goal-for-victory path detracks from replayability as each game the same tactics will be necessary.

Dear gawd, does that dice cup ever stink!

A worker placement semi-dice-fest.  A bit similar to Kingsburg, and I have heard similar to Pillars of the Earth and Castle for all Seasons.

Nonetheless with my first play of this game I was very excited.  I like this game alot because there are SO many ways to win this game.  Each person can have their own little plan, but do not stick to that plan if it is foiled, must be able to swap strategies mid-game if you want to survive!

I have heard it being broken because people just starve their people instead of feeding them.  I decided to say screw that, you GOTTA feed your people, WTF MATE?  So, every person you do not feed loses you 10 pts in my games.  Not sure if this is looked down at or not but who cares.

Even though I enjoy playing this on BSW, I've hesitated to purchase my own copy -- and it turns out for good reason. Gameplay starts off snappily with little downtime but sags midway through as it tends to get a little repetitive. I caught myself disconnecting during the chore-work parts of the game: turning in food tokens to feed meeple, turning in resources to buy cards, etc. I think it has to do with the fact that this game is simply not terribly deep strategically. More dynamic games like Puerto Rico or Le Havre also have chore-work but don't drag for me -- if anything the chore-work is a complement to the constant deliberating in those games. Nevertheless I find this to be an excellent gateway game.
-------
Style is the Goal and fewer players (2) made Stone Age much more fun. My new upped rating is based on this.

[color=#117bc0][b]Probably rather play:[/b][/color] this with the Style is the Goal expansion and not too many players.

A temática do Stone Age é legal: na Idade da Pedra, ganha quem coletar mais recursos valiosos e desenvolver tecnologias rudimentares. Pra isso, tome trabalhador pegando pedra, tijolo, madeira e comida. Ainda dá para desenvolver agricultura, se reproduzir e criar ferramentas primárias. Tudo com um pouco de sorte - a coleta depende dos dados. Diversão simples, mas com alguma estratégia. Bom para iniciantes.

I like this game for the most part, but two elements knock it down from being a favorite:

1. The dice rolling can be frustrating. There's nothing worse than putting 5-6 meeples on wood, only to roll 1s and get close to nothing, while an opponent rolls all 5s and 6s.

2. I play mostly 2 player and find at that count it's difficult to counter the "reproduce and feed" strategy (e.g. my opponent just gets to 10 meeples and gets to 10 on the agriculture track), without resorting to the same strategy. Really reduces my options on what strategy I want to employ.

RATING: 8
Having just a few plays, I can understand why this is still a highly played game.

There are multiple paths to victory - yay!  

I tend to really like games that allow me to mitigate my luck, which this one does with the tools option.  It seems like a little thing, but those tools really add up over time.

I found out in my last play that I had been starting the game incorrectly with no food - wow!  What a gross oversight and what a difference having 2 free rounds makes!  If you are interested in a resource challenge, try starting with no food - the game still works, but you definitely do not get off the ground quickly and it makes the family strategy a lot more risky.

This game has a couple of interesting things about it.  It SEEMS really complex and there ARE a lot of things going on.  But, everyone who has played it does NOT seem to get overwhelmed. Complex and intricate, but attainable.
 
The second is that there is a general feel-good nature to the game. I think my sister's evaluation was correct - it is a positive game - you are always building something and can almost always do something to help yourself regardless of what others do.  Unlike Ticket to Ride, where you somewhat mindlessly do so, you actually get to make choices here.  And that feels good.

This plays nicely as a solo, left hand vs. right hand game.  Probably because of the previous comment - you can mess me up, but only a little.

This game also has a rare quality - it combines strategy and tactics.  Most of the games I've seen are tactical.  This one allows you to pick your overall strategy (family, tools, cards, huts) and then adjust and fine tune as the gameplay dictates.

Why this is not a 10:
-> While it feels complex, it does not have the depth I prefer for a perfect game.
-> The theme works great, but there is no story.  I prefer games that have both.
-> Not quite enough control/take that - I prefer games where I can actually wreck my opponent's plans.
+ This is a fun game to play
+ It combines strategy and tactics
+ Components are excellent!

RATING: 8
First impression (3 players): I really like how dices are used in otherwise very standard resource collecting/optimization game. In Stone Age you can allocate workers in such way that you don't need to take unnecessary risks with dice. I like the simplicity of game's mechanics. At the same time game offers a good amount of choices to think about and gives a couple of roads on how to generate points.

Stone Age has many similarities with Pillars of Earth but simplicity of the game flow and non-scripted nature of it makes it a better game between the two.

The game probably is best when played with full four players as the limitations of worker placement with three players seem to hinder a bit of some dynamics of the game making it less exciting. It is still a good game even with just three but if it can get even better with four...

Worker placement for gaining resources, which are then directly converted to victory points. Lots of dice rolling, but in a good way. There's only a tiny portion of engine building, so the game might get a little bit repetitive towards the end. 

Very nice bits and artwork. Does not fit back in the box unless you toss the insert, but this will be fixed in the second edition.

Easy rules, but not that easy to balance a winning strategy. Lots of dice rolling and it is true a couple of bad die rolls can turn things bad, but ultimately statistics should balance that out, right?  ;-)
Plays lightly.

For Trade:  opened but like new.  Played 3-4 times.

Personally, I find the abstractness of the buildings and civilization cards a little off-putting.

I wonder if this game could be improved by a rework of both -- especially giving the buildings names and some function for the owning player.

The dice rolling element and the fact it's lighter and quicker than most worker placement games makes me like Stone Age. I can't get overly enthusiastic about yet another work placement game, but this one ain't bad.

RATING: 8
Has the mix of planning, luck, and player interaction that I enjoy.  Seems fairly balanced, with multiple viable strategies for victory.  Another bonus: for me, this is one of those games that a new or inexperience player can't disrupt (as they can with, say, Puerto Rico.)

RATING: 8
Possibly the most successful attempt so far at implementing dice throws in a tactical game, Stone Age uses them as a way to gather resources for the later gain of points (nothing new so far). The point is that the players start with five workers, each one of them corresponding to one die, which can be spread freely on the different tasks on the board: collecting resources, using them for scores, incorporating new workers or developing tools (extra help for the dice throws).

The game is actually a new mix of old elements, but soaks in quickly in the players, the replay value is high even during one evening, and the balance of all the ratios (pips-to-resources, resources-to-scores) is just perfect. All this makes Stone Age a bet as safe as it can get.

RATING: 6.5
Gioco dalle dinamiche semplici e immediate è un tipico piazzamento lavoratori e gestione risorse. Dopo qualche partita il tutto sembra ripetitivo in quanto le azioni disponibili non sono molte. Il vero difetto  a mio avviso però è la forte incidenza della fortuna che con un tiro di dadi sbagliati potrebbe compromettere anche la programmazione più attenta. Gli azzardi potrebbero costar caro o far vincere le partite. Il prezzo del gioco si è sempre mantenuto troppo elevato. In conclusione lo trovo un gioco godibile che giocato ogni tanto diverte anche ma non un capolavoro. C'è anche la chicca che in caso di mancanza di cibo, alla fine di ogni turno, si possono sfamare i propri lavoratori con legno, argilla, ferro o oro, ma sono dettagli.

RATING: 7.5
Similar to other worker placement games, but with a simpler set of rules and lower learning curve. The dice add a bit of randomness without ruining the strategic element.

Definitely a lighter weight game, but good fun without any significant downtime between turns.

RATING: 3.5
I've been trying to work out why Stone Age doesn't quite add up for me, and after a lot of experimentation it occurs to me that the game is almost devoid of strategy. Obviously you NEED a strategy to win, but once you've decided on what it might be, there's no going back; no 'routes around' like in Caylus or Agricola, and - owing to the clear hierarchy of action spaces - only opportunities to screw your opponents time and time over. The random element of the dice is pretty frustrating too: this just isn't how a good worker-placement game should operate.

Further Thoughts - Well, the art is nice, and I don't mind turning my brain off for an hour to play it. But there are still fundamental flaws here.

This is the best introduction to worker placement on the market today. For that and other reasons (the high quality components, the competitive gameplay, etc.), it remains a solid favorite among my game group and for me as well. Despite what you may read elsewhere by people who played this game once or twice and then dismissed it as low depth or a game with one dominant strategy (though they can't quite agree with each other what that strategy is), this game actually has a solid medium depth to go with it's excellent balance. More plays will reveal that.

One of the classics in the workerplacement genre. 
The dice mechanic for collecting the resources and the tools to mitiagte the luck are kind of neat, but overall it's just an "ok" game for me as there is not nothing really special that grabs me. But it still has a nice casual flow to it and I don't really mind playing it either.

RATING: 8
Score after first four game. Was 8.3 at first game, increased 8.4 at second. High replayibility, basic rules, enables good strategies, luck included but has less effect at final degrees in general, 100-120 minutes game time. 

Reduced to 8.1 after 4 plays. Because I am doing nearly same things in every game to win and it succeeds. Collect as much as possible wood buy cards with these woods even they are expensive (especially high bonus ones). But it is still very fun. A good example of good usage of dices and combining a bit luck with more of strategy. I won all 4 games till now so I cannot say dices are very decisive in most games.

I played my 5th and 6th game with my girlfriend. She can have difficulties in learning complicated games and she can get bored in some games but she learned Stone Age easily and liked it very much. Thats why I increase score to 8.2. But I still make same thing in every game and I made 280-320 points with my stabel strategy but my girlfriend only made 150-160.

Reduced 8.0. I still do same to win in every game. Even its negatives I think this game is still underrated here.

I finally lost my 8th game which I was still applying same strategies. This means I should change my strategies game to game more than my thoughts. Score is increased to 8.1 because of that lost and this additional info.

Increased 8.2 after playing its IPAD version tons of time.

Give up playing after some point. So decreased back 8.

My family's favorite game.  The fact that I can play it with my kids (ages 8 and 11) and that wife enjoys playing it too makes this a winner all around.  
A relatively simple "worker placement" game set in a Stone Age theme.  Set your workers down in the hunting ground, rock quarry, gold mine or one of several other places to earn points.  There's even a Love Shack(Oh,baby)to increase your tribe's size. Most points wins.  Simple, fun, terrific game with amazingly detailed art! 
In fact, we own two copies (one at home, other in the cabin up North).

[b]Stone Age[/b] was sold via auction 4/4/15.

[COLOR=#FF0000]UPDATE: 2+ years later... (rating 8):[/COLOR]

[i]Stone Age is now back in our collection! Worker placement is still a favorite mechanism of mine, but I've culled a lot of the lighter WP games from our collection and in that regard Stone Age is hard to beat. We still also own LoW, but Stone Age offers a very different experience so I'm glad to have them both in the collection again. In the interim I've owned a lot more lighter WP games and none of them have been as good as Stone Age, LoW is the only one that has stuck around, which is a testament to the design.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]This was our introduction into worker placement games and is probably my wife's favorite game. Personally I prefer other WP/action selection games[i](Agricola, Targi, Snowdonia, Agricola ACBaS and Lords of Waterdeep if I'm looking for a gateway WP game).[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

- Plays great with 2 (probably my preferred player count).
- Plays quick with 2 (under an hour).
- Great family/gateway worker placement game, the dice introduce some randomness into the game so that you can not math your way into winning.
- Rolling dice to collect resources is fun as opposed to just collecting "x" number when you go to a certain location (a la Lords of Waterdeep).
- I enjoy the diversity of ways you can score points [i](set collection, building huts, collecting builders, shaman or farmers)[/i], I like going for the civ cards.
- Beautiful board art and really nice components.

[i]This is one of my wife's favorite games and I have been threatened with bodily harm if I trade this game... until today![/i]

Stone Age is a worker placement game.  It scales well, and plays very good with 2, 3, or 4 players.  I think the strongest part of the game is the dice mechanic used to gather resources.  It is cleverly done, and you can really can manage the luck element.  There is another mechanic in the game, "tools", which also further helps you to manage the dice rolls.

But the downfall of the game is its limited strategic options.  There are two main scoring mechanics in the game: huts and cards.  If you concentrate too much on one, your scoring potential is limited, and the people who do a better job balancing the two scoring elements, usually win the game.  Consequently, I found that the games started to feel repetitive after about a dozen plays.

Originally gave this game a 9 but once I fully understood the rules, I changed it to a 10.

While it says it takes 60 minutes, it usually takes us 90 to 120 minutes to finish a 2 player game.

Everything is very high quality and the pieces are well crafted and really add to the immersion of the game.

Awesome resource management game!

Very nice and simple worker-placement game.

I like the slight randomness from the dice in this game as opposed to other worker placement games that are non-random (I guess I like the gambling aspect of gaming).

However way too swingy end game scoring & lack of depth ends up dragging the game down for me.

this is one of my favourite games i love the art and the theme (art has a certain feel to it, altough it is colorful, the colors that were used really evoke the neolithic era for me). also, i feel like i am the leader of a tribe and am sending my people to gather food and materials we need to survive. the game is really not complicated, but has a nice depth and the dice add the right amount of luck, since you can mitigate it a little. scoring is hidden in such a way, that you don't feel left out of the game if you made some bad decisions earlier, but you can have a good guess who is the leader. regarding tactics, it's really about timing your decisions, since you can take something of real value for your opponent and then risk to loose the thing you wanted for yourself, or do it other way around. there are also multiple paths that can take you to victory. i know that there are other worker placement games that received better rating and are more complicated, but for me this hits the right spot, because you can teach new players relatively quickly and still have a good tactic experience.

Bought this and my family loved it.  My wife and her brother and wife all wanted to play again and the brother said it may be his favorite game after 1 play.  They had to leave and my wife and I played another 2-player.  That rarely happens.  (Though the need for more "mean" play, blocking, keeping track of what cards they already picked up, etc. has become readily apparent after a couple of 2-player games.)

I think the concept and balance are fun--there is some confrontation over stealing desired positions and scoring opportunities, but there is usually something at least decent as another option, so more casual gamers won't be turned off.   There are multiple paths to victory and you don't feel out of the game.  Seems like a fun, much easier to teach Age of Empires or Caylus lite.  I don't usually care that much about how a game looks, but the details and composition on the board are great.  Our dice cup reeks of chemical treatment or something.

Initially I had fun playing it. Place a few villagers here, place a few villagers there, manage the risk and push the luck with dice rolls. 

In 2er or 3er this game is about observing other player's intention and try to block them, which is more enjoyable.

With 4 players then one benefits from sitting left of an inexperienced player. And the one who goes last on 1st round is VERY HARD TO WIN.

It's a nice game. But it doesn't intrigue me anymore after 9 ~ 10 plays. Simply put, it's not as fun as I thought it'd be. I would've sold it by now if I bought it. : )

Maybe I'd like it better if given chances to play more of it; but kinda doubt it

It's a nice worker placement efficiency game, with numerous ways to score points, the trick being to find a VP path that other players aren't following so you can pick 'em up cheap and without competition. There's the low risk path (straight resource conversions) and the high risk path (card collections). The latter has the New England problem - the final card(s) you need to maximise points may remain in the deck or may come out in a rush where you can't get 'em all, or may emerge cheaply attracting other players into the competition. So there's a lot of the game that's in the hands of lady luck. But at least there's good decisions to make every turn on how to allocate your workers around, when to build your engine and when to grab the points.

I love the re-playability of this game.  Each time we play it is different.  This game also has been a springboard for my family and students to get into gaming.  The game play can become very entertaining with chants of "Oooga", "Give me sumpin goood!" and "One for one is always a good deal!"

I am looking for more copies for our Board Game Club at school...

Delightful. Fun.  Lots of choices, but not too heavy.   Great theme and pieces.  60 minute game. A lot of game for your money.  It could be considered a gateway game to worker-placement/resource-management Euro games, but a lot is going on, which might overwhelm newbies.  Very good 2-player. This one grew on me; at first I thought it was lame, but with persistence I began to see the marvelous subtleties to admit that this is a perfect game.

Families and non-gaming spouses seem to like this.

RATING: 7
"Solid action drafting with dice resolution. Too long and complex to be a gateway. 2p is pretty cutthroat with denial moves."

What I like:
- Decent post-gateway game (too long and complex for a true gateway)
- Pretty board and creative worker placement mechanics

What I don't like:
- Can run long (90-120 minutes, where 60 would be better)
- Limited strategies, although a variety of tactics
- Probably requires denial blocking to do really well

There is no way I would try this with a non-gamer, unless I had reason to believe they had an aptitude for games. It is a bit of a reach even for casual gamers, unless they have played several gateway games.

I watched part of a 4p game with 2 experts and 2 newbies that took over 3 hours. 60 minutes seems doable with 2p, while 90 seems like a realistic budget for 3-4.

You definitely have to play once or twice just to understand the relative values of food, resources, and VP (not to mention tools, meeples, and food production levels). Some of the icons are pretty opaque.

On the weight scale, I think 2.5 is about right. Heavier than San Juan, similar to Alien Frontiers, and lighter than Race for the Galaxy.

This game has totally grabbed me by my balls! It's awesome! I'd say this is the perfect (and I mean PERFECT) transitional game from light-hearted family games into deeper hardcore euro-games! If you get someone to like this game and play it well, there is nothing else to stand in the way anymore of a great game of Caylus, or Goa for example!

This game is an amazing achievement! Brilliant to look at and brilliant to touch! Everything is utterly amazing, great components, gorgeous looking board and surprisingly easy rules! This is the kind of game that makes me lurk for hours, days, weeks and months in the shadow just to wait for the next gem to pop up!

Gorgeous production - the art is beautiful and I like that all the resources are shaped differently and appropriately which adds to the feel.
The game plays smoothly and hangs together well, certainly enough familiar concepts to allow it to be taught to regular gamers easily, although the concepts are worked in well and refreshingly enough to keep it different from other games in the genre.
Refer to the geek Rules discussion, as written they're a mess, amazing since they look well laid out

Volt alkalmam számítógépen kipróbálni a játékot számos alkalommal. Ott nagyon tetszett ezért megvettem. A tábla grafikája szemet gyönyörködtető, szintúgy a kártyáké is. A játék alkatrészeinek minőségére nem lehet panasz. Végre egy olyan játék, amiben az alapanyagok nem a sablonos kis kockákra egyszerűsödnek le. Az aranynak aranyrúd formája van, a fa pedig deszkára hasonlít stb. Az ételt kis korongok szimbolizálják. Ebből nem értem, hogy miért adnak olyan sokat, mert a játékot 4 emberrel játszva talán a harmadát ha felhasználtuk. Viszont a nyersanyagokból adhattak volna talán többet, mert volt amikor igencsak megfogyatkozott egy-két alapanyag. Dobókocka is van a játékban, amiből a játékot nem ismerők azt gondolhatnák, hogy erősen szerencsefüggő a játék. Azonban ez nem így van. Igaz szükség van szerencsére is, de az elrontott dobások eredményét nagyban befolyásolhatjuk az összegyűjtött szerszámokkal. Egy valami nem tetszett a játékban. 4 játékossal kissé vontatott lett. Én unatkoztam, amíg a többiek begyűjtötték a nyersanyagjaikat, illetve vásároltak. A játékot 4 emberrel majdnem 2 órán keresztül játszottuk. 2 emberrel is kipróbáltuk. Én így jobban élveztem, és a játékidő is a felére csökkent.

Euro like "family" game. A little like Agricola and a little like Caylus this is a worker placement game where you collect resources to build stuff. Pretty easy to teach to new people minus scoring. Love the wood resources and meeples that actually look sorta what they represent. Being a dice game some randomness will keep experienced players back with the pack a little and best for noobs is that if you are in last place is that you dont know it till the end!

New - Love the game even more now! My friends who are even into more thematic games are calling me just to play another round. So far I've been able to win each game but they are starting to steal my strategies so I got be more cleaver :-)

My main issue with Stone Age is that it cannot handle 5 players.  The most popular game with wife-friends and usually the first "next step" game I introduce new gamers to after Ticket to Ride.  After so many plays, we can set up and whack through a 4 player game of SA in about 75 minutes, and it's usually an open question as to who will win right up until the end.

After playing at a con, I wanted to get this, because it was just so easy, and I hadn't played any other worker placement games.  I have played a few times since then, and still like this one.  A good worker placement game, though there seem to be very few good, useful strategies, and I definitely hit on one of them my first play.  After completely destroying two people in a 3 player game this past weekend (230-130-120), I feel like maybe I've mastered this one, but I do want to try it some more with more experienced players.

A relatively quick, worker-placement with set-collection component.

A game to remember to factor in the set collection component for endgame. I'm great at not taking this into consideration appropriately..

It's smacks a little of Agricola flavor without all the card specialization/memorization commitment.  I really like that.

All games against my wife have been a landslide in my favor so far, which frustrates her.  Very nice board, artwork, and components - a lot of bang for the buck from a quality standpoint.

15+ plays - If you can't have SOME fun with Stone Age, then I don't think you'll enjoy any Euro style game. Turn order/ placement priority is important, as you will get quickly blocked from the best spaces. Some people say that the die rolling for resources gets a little repetitive. I can see that point, but it has never really bothered me much.

RATING: 7
A worker placement game, but in my opinion, one of the worst. There is a lot of luck due to the dice roll during the acquisition of resources being partially based on dice rolls and a good roll can give you an unfair advantage. Also, the main spots (get an additional worker, gain farm area and get tools) are always the first ones to go after, so you only get them when you are early in the turn order. Not really worth a try as there are so many better games in the genre. It would be best used to introduce new players to the genre.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A really fun "roll dice and collect stuff" game.  Simple to play, but hard to pay well.  You have to judiciously upgrade early (tools, food, love hut) to get an engine going while always keeping an eye out for the good multiplier cards and you have to constantly weigh opportunity cost/risk.  Of course you don't have to do any of this to simply have fun.  I think this game is best with 2.  With 4 the downtime starts to ratchet up a bit when everyone is resolving their workers, but it is not excessive.  The fact that as much as 2/3 of the scoring can be end game scoring can be a tad frustrating; it can be difficult to gauge how you are doing midgame.  But skilled players learn to keep tabs on that as well.

Un gioco che mette d'accordo tutti: quello a cui piace far ruzzolar dadi, l'amante dell'eurogame, il giocatore assiduo e quello occasionale. A un sistema di gioco non particolarmente originale si compenetra un tema insolito ma azzeccatissimo, e una grafica veramente eccezionale. Le meccaniche si integrano con l'ambientazione perfettamente, e l'interazione è molto alta (ma non troppo da impedire ogni strategia a medio termine). Sempre a proposito di strategie, è così ben bilanciato da permettere di battere più strade per conseguire la vittoria. Uno dei migliori giochi di piazzamento di sempre.

First off - what a lovely looking game!

It's a game that has lots of different ways to win and part of the fun is trying a different road to victory (or loss) each time.

One play, two players.  This is a resource management game, much like Pillars of the Earth, combined with rolling dice for resource production.  I would like it more if the game were harder.  This is about Neander-meeples living the high life in dense populations, and building up big stockpiles of lumber, stone and gold.. weird.  End scores were in the 150-200 point range.  The whole game felt loose, with little significant interaction between players, and it was far too easy to score.

First, this is a heavy game with lots of nice peices. A great game of worker placement for resource collection. As you play you gain more workers or more abilities to collect resources. Resources feed your workers and using the right combinations collect points or items to help you win.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A decent collect-resources-and-turn-them-into-VPs game.  The components are excellent and the board is beautiful.  However, the game suffers some balance issues, as wood is clearly the best resource.  Collecting any of the resources has the same expected value (1 meeple placement = 1 VP), but with wood you run into less remainder problems, and since it is the least expensive, it's the best for buying cards.

(5+ plays)

Lovely resource-management / worker-placement game.  Simple enough to appeal to non-gamers, but still has the edge that makes it fun.  Probably better on BSW, as the actual game is quite fiddly. Think I became too good at it, but now that I haven't played in a while, I am back with the pack.

The key to winning seems to be building the most buildings and getting the most point multiplyers with cards, both of which are usually purchased with random resources.

That and the fact that the penalty for not feeding your people is so minor that it doesn't even matter turns what could have been a good game into a mediocre (at best) game.

The dice cup and high production values earn it an extra point though.

If you're looking for a worker placement game done right, get Archipelago instead.

Playtime: ~30 minutes per player

Comment: Classic gateway worker placement game. It has dice and it's got quality components. While it's not exactly deep, it's got a little bit of room to stretch your legs strategy wise. Plays relatively quickly and is easy to explain. Downtime can be a bit long with 4 players, but it's nothing terrible. Overall I like this game. Great artwork on the board, too.

Optimal Player Count: 4 > 3 > 2

Plays well with all player counts, 4 just makes it easier to not have to artificially restrict things.

RATING: 9.7
A classic medium-weight euro family game, featuring a worker-placement mechanism. The game is fairly easy to explain, even to non-gamers and you can really have fun with up to 4 players. With only 2 experienced players, the game turns into a deeper strategic game, where the randomness factor is just limited to the dice and the order that the civilization cards will come up. I would thus recommend it either as a 2-player strategic game, or as a 3-4 player fun game.

The component quality in this game is awesome. It can really win over gamers and non-gamers alike.

In STONE AGE meeples collect resources that will be used as payment for other stuff that will be transformed into VP’s.

Many compare this game to another worker placement game – PILLARS OF THE EARTH – so I’ll give my view on this as well.

In short: STONE AGE have a bit less scripted game play than PILLARS which is good, but the long-term strategies in STONE AGE – buy and collect different types of “civilization cards” – feels a lot more abstract.

PILLARS gives you a sense of accomplishment. In STONE AGE you don’t – these bonus cards in the end just amount up an awful lot of VP’s and makes a huge impact on the track. Those cards have different icons on it, but you just don’t really know what you have accomplished. 

STONE AGE feels more “busy” and offers at first sight more choices. But in the end it’s just a matter of collecting the right amount of something that lets you buy something. It feels rather interchangeable, although it becomes more and more apparant after mid-game that some cards are more optional than others if you want your civ-card and building tiles combos to boost your end score further.

In PILLARS there’s a greater risk strategies might burst, because you take greater risk when you upgrade your specialists to perform a certain thing. In STONE AGE the upgrades contains of piling up the “tools”. Those let you tweak the dice results and grab more resources. 

PILLARS is more convoluted, but in a good way. In STONE AGE you quietly calculate in numbers all the time. Although the dices, the “love hut” and the collecting food thing save STONE AGE from being all too procedural, I clearly rank PILLARS as the better game.

Need to play STONE AGE more for a more solid rating.

An excellent Gateway game for worker placement. Fun for everyone. Haven't had anyone dislike it yet. 

Not my favorite work placement but it's a good solid fun game that has no problems getting to the table. It seems to play best with four.



My wife always seems to beat me at this game...

Edit: I'm thinking Champions of Midgard will replace this one for me...but we'll see.

I got this game in Jan 2010 based on BGG recommendations, and it has been a big hit with my friends. Two couples I know went out and got their own copies right away. It's great with 2, 3, or 4. I like how there are multiple strategies to pursue, and some of them work better together than others. The game is really pretty, with nice pieces. We don't use the leather dice rolling container though because it is really stinky. My husband and I like to play this by ourselves too.

Love it.  Reminds me of the old computer games I used to play, Age of Empires.  I love the theme and the components to the game are great.  The initial rules were a lot to take in at once, but we played one game and wasn't too bad at all.  I give it a 9.5 and not a 10 because the rules could have been laid out better I think.  It took just about as much time to understand the rules and it did to play the first game.

RATING: 7.5
Initial impression... a very light and quickly played civ.ish. type of game.  Almost like a very very light Puerto Rico without all the analysis.

Fun Factor: 7
Components: 9 (Leather cup & wooden dice are nice!)
Theme: 8
Mechanics: 6 (There is a problem here... the decisions are very facile, once you have played several times the strategy is very deterministic-- the choices are made for you once you understand the values of various selections.  I have found placing one meeple on first Civ card to be a slightly better option than everything else. Hence, the game for me is more about choosing when NOT to take the first Civ card in favor of doing something else.)
Theme + Mechanics: 8
Replay Value: 6 (Good replay here as you try to manipulate better and better scores, but see the comment on mechanics- the game gets easier and easier to predict.)
Scaling/Players: 10 (Plays so well with various numbers it amazes me.)
Subjective -0.25 Hit because the interaction is so indirect.  I need a bit more direct contact with opponents! But this isn't nearly as bad as Puerto Rico for indirect strategic play...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is an excellent medium-light game. The decision space is more constrained than in something like Puerto Rico or Agricola, so new players are able to grasp the engine quickly, but it still offers depth and multiple strategies. The interesting decisions in the game come from risk management, timing infrastructure vs. resource vs. points acquisitions, estimating opportunity costs, and choosing a development path. It's important when teaching the game to really emphasize how many points can come from the cards, as new players tend to focus on the immediate points from building.

I like it alot. However rolling the dice takes too much time... Maybe it's a quibble, but I find it very annoying.

Another negative is my gf doesn't like it. She finds it boring. Although I should have known. it's a worker placement. Hope it will get some more love in the future though.

RATING: 8
Classic WP which still holds up. Perfect game to introduce mechanisms used in heavier games, but stands very well on it's own. It's a game that is straight-forward and has a good amount of choices to be made, although the options you should go for are from time to time very apparent. Playing with a new set of players usually result in interesting games, where strategies and tactics diverge wildly (like someone going all in for gold right off the bat!). For me, the randomness of the dice actually add tension to the game which I enjoy. Family friendly.

Not logged older plays.

I like this game; you can play it with old people. Just say it's "caveman bunco," and that'll get their attention.  

If you play it with depression era people, like your grandparents, you can taunt them about feeding their cave dudes. Watch their upper lips quiver. 

"Grandpa, you've got to feed your people, or they'll all staaaaarve!"

Watch him plop all his cave dudes on fishing after that. Leaves the juicy spots open for you.  

Seriously though (because board games are serious business), Stone Age is easily approachable by people of all ages. Nothing too tough about it. If someone asks you to describe it, just say: 

"It's a game about stone age tribes, each trying to outdo the other. You send your little cave dudes out to fish, mine, and make babies. The winner, in the end, is the tribe that's most prosperous." 

If they say "Sounds complicated," just add: "It's really just dice rolling." (that's usually your instant sale right there, if they don't like complicated games) 

The game works equally well on three levels; light hearted fun, light strategy, and for those who enjoy complaining that the choices are all obvious. 

Approach Stone Age like a light hearted filler, and you'll  have lots of fun...while losing lots of games. The board requires much more thought than readily apparent. That's because of a few different factors: The variable mix of huts coming up every turn, your luck with the dice, the turn order, and the playing style of the other players.

While some choices seem obvious on the surface, like taking agriculture whenever possible, astute players may surprise you by doing something else. Still, if you just want to play with cave dudes, while not thinking too deeply, you may certainly play Stone Age like a light filler. You'll have lots of fun, while losing lots of games.   

As a light strategy game, Stone Age really shines. When approaching the game from that perspective, you start thinking more about what your opponents are doing, and less about your own strategy. Why do I say that? Because the game is often decided not by what you choose to do, but rather what your opponents will permit you to accomplish. 

If you want to know what you can do on your turn, then you must learn to predict the actions of the other players. Just picking agriculture or tools at every option won't accomplish that goal. Because...smart opponents won't let you do that. Alternately, even smarter opponents, will let you pick what you want, then adapt their own strategy to both counter what you've done, and ensure their win. 

I'm running long, so I'll wrap this up: I like this game.  It has something for just about everyone. It serves well as either a light strategy game, or a "move dudes around on a board," game. The design is clean, the rules unambiguous, and it handles well around the corners. Highly recommended.

Played through with my wife tonight and we both loved it. This instantly ranks as one of (if not the) our favorite games that we play together. 

The game was the right length, right depth and just the right amount of interaction. It does not hurt that the components were beautiful as well.

My only worry is that it will get old after a while, but fortunately we are pretty busy and that could take quite a while.

Update: After two plays we like it even more. Although the strategy does not look too deep, there is more than meets the eye. My wife got the jump on me and I never caught up.  I am now 0-2.

Update: three games in and I have yet to win. I like it more and more and so does my wife.

I'm not in love with the dice rolling mechanic -- had an easy time feeding the "boys" and it seemed to take any real tension away from the game. The rating may go up for me, however, once we play a few more times and get things going strategically.

Beware of the stinky dice cup -- the game smelled really bad and had to air out on the porch before we could play it. I've gotten rid of the dice cup, so I guess I'll be keeping the game. Otherwise, this one would surely be traded away.

Nice light-weight worker placement game. The relatively minor resource conversion (from resource directly to cards or buildings) makes it fairly easy for new folks to grasp.  Certainly my partner likes it more than some heavier weight worker placement games. I'm fine with the die rolling for resources. This can level the playing field a bit with new folks and it's easy enough to stock up on tools to mitigate poor die rolling.

I finally get to play this at a local board game meetup and am I glad that I did. This game scratches the math itch inside me where Lords of Waterdeep doesn't. I always have affinity to mathy games more than a thematic game for some reason. Thus I collect some Dr. Knizia's game in my collection. I ranked 2nd in a 4 player game in my first try, not bad! I would want to play this again.

I bought this game for Thanksgiving/Xmas season 2013! I played with brother and sister-in-law tonight and this game is a solid 9/10. I am happy :)

RATING: 8
Rating based on one play, and I really enjoyed it.  Posting a limited # of pieces on various tasks is the sort of mechanic that I adore, and the entire game is deceptively simple, with just the right amount of conflict.  

*Update* Played about 5 times now.  The "starve" strategy kind of bugs me, primarily because my appreciation of the game is in the process and not in streamlining a way to victory, but this reflects my own bias that folks playing Stone Age to be clever should be playing Caylus.  That said, it's not particularly clever as much as anti-fun.  The first time I heard that you only lost ten points when you starved I knew it was a generous weak point.  To take advantage of that is likely contrary to the designers' intent, which was (I think) more of an effort to keep those newbies whose people starve from despairing. More experienced gamers should suffer a stiffer penalty, like the ten points loss plus returning all food and commodities.  Because of my admitted fuddy-duddy-ness this game is "down" to an 8.

Update again:  Okay, having been "forced" to a starvation strategy (in a 4 player game) and winning I can see its attractiveness, though I still think a stiffer penalty (in terms of commodities or, logic forfend, people) should be put in the offing.

You can have different strategies to win this game. The balance is very good design, especially on the "Tool" design which can help you to minimize the element of luck. Its replay value is high, gameplay is interesting. Hope to get a physical copy soon.

Great, accessible worker placement game.  It's easy to learn.  Components are beautiful and work well.  It sets up quickly and flows effortlessly.  It's got more interaction than games like Agricola.  The die-rolling mechanism for resources is inspired!  And the flexibility in turn order almost equals variable turn order.  Wow, what an amazing, balanced, elegant design.  And lots of fun.  After several plays, took it down from a 10 to a 9.  I like to play it very much, but the game's largess, which is so welcome to a new player, makes it a little less than a nail-biter. Stone Age makes a great bridge game from gateways to heavy games (particularly worker placement games such as Caylus).  Backup to a 10. I am always willing to play this great game.  It's the prefect weight; I always want to haul it out on game night.
*Sigh*:  finally took it down to 9.  Still love it, but  so many awesome worker placement games have come along since Stone Age...

Some people consider this a contemporary classic worker placement board game. I'm not sure about that, though.

A good economic development game, with several non-trivial and tense tactical choices to be made throughout the game. Moreover, another gorgeous board by Michael Menzel. However one major thing lets the game down: lack of elegance. The dice rolling that can be offset, the cards with its various bonuses and scoring contributions, the many ways of combining goods to transform them into VPs, although in the end they're equivalent: all that makes the game complicated and the theme even thinner. Moreover, it's too long for the fun it offers.

Awesome worker placement game, started playing it on Board Game Arena and quickly got hooked to it. I especially like the controllable luck factor achieved through the dice rolls vs. number of dice used to fetch a determined resource. The importance of the bonuses on civilization cards during the end scoring might be under-looked by new players which can cause some score imbalances during your first few plays.

It's fun to switch up on your normal approach and try a new way to play, only to find success (or even abject failure :)). It's a testament to  good play balance. 

The artwork and bits are terrific; it's a very nicely produced game. Lots and lots of replay value. Excellent stuff.

I really like worker placement games. Stone Age is fun. 

However, the decisions you make throughout the game are for the most part trivial. Your options are either practically equal in value, or obviously unequal. Multiple paths to victory? Not really. Instead of 'If my strategy is X, then Y is my best choice here', it's more 'Y is obviously my best choice here, so I guess my strategy is going to be X'. It's not about making a plan, but about identifying the best option every turn, which is usually easy.

This doesn't have to be a problem. It can be nice that you don't really have to think about 90% of your moves. Plus, the remaining 10% is where you win or lose the game, so it's still interesting. It's deciding who to block, and when. It's deciding if you want the game to end sooner or later. It's figuring out what your opponents want and how you can use that to your advantage. It's trying to guess and manipulate what your options will be next turn.

But all these choices are made in the second part of the game. It's almost like you might as well skip the first half and randomly give people some cards and resources instead. I worry that because strategy is mostly reactive, because you base it on whatever you happen to get, the replayability will be low. For some people, the fact that it's a simple, fun experience, might be enough to play it again and again. But Stone Age is not a game that has a lot to discover, where each play is different and you learn more every time you play.

It's fun, but the design feels lazy. Not much to dislike, but not much to love either. Probably best as a gateway game.

Besides Tribune, Stone Age is the next best use of the worker placement mechanic which inherently has tension for limited spots; reason for being second best is that being placed for resources can be undermined by the dice. Then Stone Age slides down due to the maths as there are divisions, adding and a 10 point subtracting with multipliers to hurt the exercise. So will never match the joy of Tribune for the best implementation of the worker placement mechanic, for in the city of Rome, the avenues of progress are directed by simple street signs written on the cards or represented by icons on the faction strip.

A more interesting exercise of resource conversion to victory points than Pillars of the Earth as text is replaced by icons.


My concerns about the playing time evaporated due to most of the placement actions can be resolved simultaneously when everyone has their set of dice, with only the "die roll" civ card halting the proceedings.

This is a fun game. Tough and interesting decision making throughoutand, which gives the player great control over the outcome. I would put this game in the same style and type category as Caylus and Agricola, but lighter, more straight forward, and perhaps with less subtlety. Therefore it is more accessible and shorter than those games. I think most gamers who like the games I mentioned will enjoy this one as well. The BSW online version is a lot more fun to play since it take care of all the fiddly aspects, so I give that version a rating of 9.

Lands on complexity and length somewhere between Dominion and Agricola. Fairly approachable for newer gamers, but is not an entry level game exactly. We enjoy it a lot, but after a few years of plays it has seemed to distill down a bit from what it started as. Largely it's, who can buy the most cards, more than who manages to just buy the right cards. It gets plenty of play but maybe not as much as either of the otehr two games. A good one to have in the pile to ensure your collection has a variety of offerings.
But just buy all the cards you can consistently don't be too fussy about what you buy seems a decently winning enough plan to roll with.

Munkáslehelyezős játék, amikor különböző bányákba, a földekre, a kunyhóépítésre vagy akár népesedére (ide ugye két ősembert kell letenni :)).
Szinte mindenhol kockával kell dobni, annyival ahány embert raktunk, majd a termény értékétől függően kettővel (étel), vagy akár hattal (arany) kell osztani az összeget.
Kellemes családi játék.

Played this once at a board gaming fundraising event. Beautiful components. Fairly straightforward resource to VP conversion game with a few new ideas to shake things up. Worried starvation may be a viable strategy which would spell doom for the theme. Hidden point-scoring cards for game-end was how our game was won, so blocking other players' strategies is important. Seems like the player with least competition will likely win so 4 player seems better than 3.

7 plays.  A bit lighter, faster playing version of Pillars of the Earth.  Economic engine is very intuitive and satisfying.  Bits are decent.  Game is learned and played faster than it would appear to.  Feeding is flawed - penalty for starving is too small, both thematically and game balance wise.

[floatleft][ImageID=300588][/floatleft]I love introducing new games to people in my gaming groups and having them fall in love with a game that I presented to them. Introducing new games is a very rewarding experience and Stone Age was no exception. Stone Age is light and fast with solid mechanisms and it was an instant hit. 

After playing several games of Stone Age I found that wood is more valuable/powerful than gold because it is easier to gather and use to purchase cards. At first this bothered me but after stewing over this for awhile I realized that thematically wood and clay should be more valuable than gold because it would be more useful to people during the Stone Age compared with gold. Well played Bernd Brunnhofer.

Easier to explain than Pillars Of The Earth. The theme ties in well with the mechanics. Dice rolling adds a bit of drama to the whole thing. The only thing is the scoring is so high that you wrap around the scoring track 2 or 3 times. Maybe a LITTLE too long for what it is, but a pretty good game none the less.

Stone Age offers a similar play-time and ease-of-learning to Endeavor, but where Endeavor has no luck, Stone Age has an awful lot of it. My main problem with the design is that there is no compensation at all for rolling low numbers on the dice. Over the course of the game this will even out to some extent, but I can still see it determining the winner. The different tasks your workers get to perform didn't particularly interest me - you just seem to be endlessly gathering resources and spending them - and there were a few spaces that always seemed to be taken first. The lack of any turn order manipulation also bothered me.

Game of turning dice pips into VP game.  There are a two main paths, cards and huts.  Huts directly convert accumulated pips (with round down) into VP.  The card route is a little more of a gamble, but looks to be potentially more lucrative.

Too much luck for my taste.  Some people recommend this as a lighter-Agricola, but I would recommend just playing the Family game of Agricola until the players are seasoned-enough for Occupations and Minor Improvements.  Agricola is undeniably a better game, so why waste precious space in your collection on a mediocre, if lighter, imitator?

Hands down my favorite game. Of course it helps that I like the luck element in the game. But lets face it, there is much more to this game than luck. Any game with a consistant run of crappy dice rolls will kill your chances of a win, but what are the odds that that would happen? There are still so many elements of strategy (or at the very least tactics) to this game to offset any complaints of luck. And the playtime is GODLY!!!!

A good, almost great worker placement game. I like the balance of options and the multiple scoring paths. The only thing I don't really like is the dice rolls for resource gathering. 1d6 is just too swingy for a game like this, and a few fantastic or terrible rolls by one player can skew the game quite a bit. The should have used some other distribution with a smaller range or a bell curve. As deep as the decisions in the rest of the game are, it feels very frustrating to have this one aspect be so dependent on random chance.
It does feel like this game works better with fewer players, so you get more turns total and more chances to get dice mitigation.

1 5-player game (with the expansion), 4 of us were newbies. I'm not much of a fan of worker placement games where die rolling is involved, and this game has an excessive amount. The results were grossly unbalanced as the winner had nearly 2.5x the VP of the last 2 players. (I suffered some very poor die rolls where successive rolls of snake-eyes where only 3's were needed to gain 24 VP.) Overall just a more complicated, overlong, dice driven version of Pillars of the Earth.

Oh, and what theme; dice to 'cubes' to VP?

Another worker placement - get resources to trade for victory points. At least you have a few alternative ways to get the victory points, and to increase your productive abilities.

First impression of a two player game.
The material is outstanding and can be compared to the one of Hamburgum. The little cup for the dies with the artisanal look is superb. The rules are easy to understand and to explain. The mechanic is similar to Pillars of the Earth but it flows better compared to Pillars. With the number of ways to make victory points it's hard to keep track. So for players who like to always have a knowledge of where they stand, it can be impossible, and so frustrating for them. Never the less, I realy enjoyed my first game and looking forward for the next one.
Next game: My first impression stands. I realy like this game. It flows very well and it's way better than Pillars of the Earth to my opinion.

Première impression d'une partie à deux joueurs.
Le matériel est exceptionnel. Il se compare à celui d'Hamburgum. La petite coupe pour les dés avec la touche artisanale est superbe. Les règles sont simples et facile à expliquer. La mécanique de jeu s'apparente à celle des Pilliers de la Terre, mais celle-ci coule mieux que pour les Pilliers. Le grand nombre de possibilités de faire des points de victoire rend presque impossible de déterminer votre position. Pour les joueurs qui aiment le contrôle et savoir leur statut par rapport aux autres joueurs, cet aspect peut déplaire voir frustrer. Néanmoins, j'ai bien apprécié ma première partie et j'ai bien hâte d'y rejouer.
Deuxième partie. Ma première impression demeure. J'aime bien ce jeu. Celui-ci roule vraiement bien et est nettement meilleur que les Pilliers de la Terre à mon opinion.

10/10. Looking for the next step after Ticket to Ride? As a game to introduce new friends to resource management gaming, this is a hit. Have taught kids as young as 10 and adults in their 50's by going gently, step by step. (See my guide for teaching new players) It is a perfect balance between luck, planning and boldness. The theme is tightly integrated to the game play and play doesn't drag. It's a meaty game without being too heavy for the casual player, with the bonus of sneaky math teaching for the kids at the table. Beautiful board and components (the leather dice cup sells the hell out of the game) top it all off. Lots of comments about how it's too light for the serious gamer, but this is a game that hits the table all the time and never fails to please. Best game ever NOT to have won Speil  des Jahres!

Stone Age is a very good resource management game that adds a nice touch of randomness to the mix.

RATING: 8
(rating based on a few 2-player games only) An exceptionally elegant and engaging game from Hans Im Glueck, which manages to seamlessly combine a wide variety of player choices without losing focus. Each turn moves quite briskly, as players place meeples in a variety of places on the board to improve their tribe or collect resources, while making sure they gather enough food to keep their population fed at the end of each turn.

Much of the nuance comes from the civilization cards, which offer dual benefits, and to the huts, the two primary scoring mechanisms in the game.

Some have complained about the luck of dice rolls possibly souring the experience (Settlers style), but assiduous use of the tools counters in the game (which give bonuses to die rolls) should minimize this.

Perhaps most importantly, the slightly more unique theme is very well-integrated, and all the components are excellent -- especially the fabulous board art -- pushing the game to a solid "8" in my book.

Stone Age has a little steeper learning curve (imo) than Settlers or Carcassone...  But, once you get it, it is a lot of fun and easy.  I love a game that can be funny, and talking about making villagers eat bricks or sticks, making babies, and  making fun of the all mighty power you posses over your poor villagers makes this game one of the most fun games for those that don't win, even though the play is still competitive and a good amount of strategy is used.  Also, the fact that the game has a well-balanced mix of luck and strategy and points are counted during play and after adds a level of excitement for me as well.  I've also found that you can switch up your strategy and still keep a good chance of winning which can make the game more interesting to play often.

24/08/2013: Had my first game with Steven, Trent and Liang. 

A lighter game than its cousins (i.e. The Pillars of the Earth and World without End), there is a tendency for players to converge on the same spots on the board during the first few rounds, namely those which increase food supply permanently, increase the number of workers on hand and provides players with tools to modify their die rolls. Apart from this, the game is not as deterministic as the other two due to the high dependency of resource collection rate on die rolls, and this ensures that each game will turn out differently.

Stone Age is a smooth playing worker placement game.  Like all worker placement games that have come out lately it feels like a descendant of Caylus.  In this case Stone Age is shorter, less complicated and comes with a healthy dose of dice rolling.

It's hard to imagine a game more carefully designed.  All the game play elements fit together perfectly - too perfectly.  There is no suprise or excitement in the game.  Players play their cave people into the various locations.  As they are cavemen they don't do much besides gather goods, or convert goods into points. Unlike other games of it's kind it doesn't feel like you are building anything.

The gathering is accomplished through rolling dice.  The more cave men you have in a location, the more dice you get to roll.  This is the most interesting part of the game.  Like most worker placement games you can block the other players out of an area by placing your cavemen first.  This adds a minor element of competition and planning to get what you need.

Stone Age's biggest problem is that it doesn't feel particularly new or innovative.  Also, it lasts way too long for the amount of excitement it provides.  Basically it's a bland experience all around.

I love this game. Very fun use of resource management and trying to predict your opponents moves in order to plan your turns. You can play with 2 players but the game is much more fun when playing with 3 or 4.

The objective of this game is to be the point leader.  How you get your points is the key.  You must have a population and the population requires food every turn.  The population allows you to try and gather resources including food to feed your population.  Resouces are used to buy huts worth points or cards worth points at the end of the game.  Remember you need to buy cards.  Cards score points at the end of the game.

Very popular.  Easy to learn and play (i've had reactions like: gather goods, buy things and feed my people ... i can do that).  Lots of dice rolling but good strategy always seems to beat lucky dice rolling.

Coloquei todas as cartas em saquinhos bem justos (parecem lacradinhas no plástico) e há uma bandeja plástica com todos os componentes de madeira. E os tiles de construções estão em um ziplock.

Foi jogado várias vezes, mas está em ótimo estado de conservação.

Takes the dice rolling in Kingsburg and marries it with a strong dose of contention a'la Aladdin's Dragons, and throws in a pinch of a Yspahan dice mechanic. There's a lot of placing, then rolling, then resolving, and every placement is contentious. If someone took your move first, it requires constant instant recalculations. It is a very good game, I like it similar to Kingsburg, but a tad less due to all the built-in conflict and blocking.

After playing again after awhile, I realize what I dislike about this game : you have to place your dice first, THEN roll. So if you get unlucky, there's nothing you can do about it.
In Kingsburg, if you roll badly, THEN you play and try to make the best of the bad luck.
THAT's the key difference, and why I like Kingsburg (much) more.

Perhaps the first worker-placement game I have played and I very much enjoy it. Admittedly, I may have been sold just on the leather cup you use to roll the dice (Yahtzee!); however, it is a very beautiful game with elegant mechanics.

Some in my gaming group found it a little boring and have not suggested it since but they may just not be fans of worker-placement games.

An excellent Gateway game for those who can think beyond roll and move. But also a fun game with many strategies that can be used. Blaming luck is just a crutch for poor decision making in this game. The better player should win most of the time. I didn't think anything would displace this as my favorite game, then Dominion came along.

I had been wanting to try this game for a bit, and now I have. I really like this game, there are several definite strategies that you can take. In my first game I was afraid I wouldn't do too well with end game scoring after only taking 3 Civ cards, but between them they gave me 51 points, enough for an over 15 point win.

RATING: 9.3
Stone Age is a fantastic game of resource management and powers acquisition, with a perfect blend of player interaction, advance planning, and balancing different strategies.  There are a huge number of options, increasing as the game progresses, with the best choice being far from obvious.  It plays a lot like Caylus as far as competion for resources, but has many clever game features that are different, for a completely different game of the same quality.  This is one of the very few games I decided I wanted to buy after the first play. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Really like this.  Once you understand the odds of dice rolling and the power of end scoring this game is far more than "which of 3 options to pick first".  Theme seems to work better than Pillars of the Earth for most.

Instantly accessible euro. Not a lot of tough decisions to be made. You just need to hope your strategy pays off when the cards are flipped at the start of each turn and you are playing first. 

I really liked the dice throws to win resources. Didn't throw the game. It's a very tight design and all scoring links together well. Once newbies get the hang of multiplers, this would be a good intro game.

There is nothing wrong with this game.  I definitely like it.  I think the only issue is that I'm discovering that I'm personally not that hot on worker placement games.  But this game itself is simple to teach, has a decent amount of strategy, and doesn't take too long to play.  I do enjoy it, and wouldn't resist a request to play this game.

This game is extremely interesting. It isn't very complicated (if you don't count final scoring which is quite messy) and I find the theme quite satisfying, even if the theme is interchangeable it works well with the mechanics.

I don't understand why people call this a gateway game.  The mechanics are kind of simple, but the scoring is so confusing to someone new to boardgames.  The civ cards and buildings require repeat reference to the booklet to decipher what they do and how they score.  And the amount of math in the game just becomes tedious.  There are way better worker placement games.  And for a gateway/beginner worker placement game, I would never recommend this over Lords of Waterdeep or Manhattan Project

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game is fascinating.  The resources and the food production are almost like balancing monies, so you have to make sure that you don't spend more than you have as an income.  At the same time, players have to try to buy limited time cards and buildings before their opponents.  This game requires balancing many different aspects while simultaneously presenting many different methods to achieve that balance. 

***Update***

Rating lowered to a six because Stone Age is a little dull.  I don't feel any push to try a new strategy.  Collect civ cards and buy cheap resources while my opponent collects gold and builds golden huts with fancy tools.  There is no mechanic in Stone Age that gives me a reason to find a different strategy.  Perhaps playing with more than two players would change that because other players would be occupying the spots I want, but I've got better games to play with gamers and better games to play with my family.

This is my favorite Euro game.  I'm not sure why this one stands out above the rest to me, but it does.  When it's not your turn things can get tense because you're hoping the other players don't take the location that you want. With more experienced players you can play a cut throat game and block some of the options you think they are after. You can never do everything you want to do and after each game it leaves me wanting to play again.

Update:  This is no longer my favorite Euro game but it's a great introductory game to non gamers.

This game is brutal on new players.  I recently played with my family and a group of friends that had never played, and in both cases, in spite of reminders by me regarding the importance of cards and the strength of the agriculture and tools, I still demolished them, lapping them twice on the score board.

I think this is a great game for new gamers, it's interesting but still accessible, unfortunately, some of them have a bad taste in their mouth from the stomping they received from me :P

RATING: 7
A very simple dice euro. Great as a gateway to heavier games. The dice/luck can be a little much sometimes but players will find decent ways to help mitigate it using tools or lots of workers. Turns flow smoothly between players, but ifeel like there should be a way to take 1st player, since its so clearly a powerful position.

As a two player game, I and my wife have really enjoyed Stone Age.  The dice produce a little unpredictability, but you can manage that with tools.  I like a little unpredictability, anyway :D.

RATING: 9.5
Fun game.  Highly recommended.   For those interested....I'm in the camp that the game would benefit from stronger rules against the starvation strategy. 

3 Basic strategies:  be a hut builder (ends the game quicker), collect culture cards, or balance the two scoring mechanisms.  Several sub-strategy decisions:  optimal family size, feed or starve, how many tools to collect.....these sub-strategies will impact which cards you buy and be impacted by which cards you are able to get.

The hidden scoring at the end is one of the things that really makes this game shine.  You can be going for a strategy and if folks aren't paying close attention (or are too wrapped up in their own strategy), you make be able to make a killing in the final bonus scoring.

Lots of meaningful decisions, lots of dice rolling.  Just plain fun!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
This was a very pleasant game to play. I can't think of any negative criticisms. I would highly recommend this game.

This is a worker placement game for casual gamers.  Most worker placement games can get very tight with high player counts.  So much so that people might feel put off by their limited options.  It's also pretty common to feel limited simply by the number of workers you get.

I don't think Stone Age falls into either trap.  Everyone starts with a fair amount of workers, and it goes up from there.  There are generally several open spaces no matter what the player count is.  Towards the end of the game it gets a tad tight (as everyone has so many more workers than when they started), but the limiting spaces are generally not as sought after by then.

If you are looking for a light weight worker placement game I can't think of any better game than Stone Age.

Straight forward, light worker placement game. You depend a little bit on the dice rolls, but since you roll a lot, this should average out. Very strategic in that you focus on a certain thing and excecute this through. Some different kinds of set collection,  some randomness, some worker placement without too much meanness: a light family Euro.

To me, it feels like there's nothing going on in this game. Maybe I just don't like dice, but it feels too swingy to me. It's not light enough to be a filler but not heavy enough to be satisfying. There are so many medium-complexity games that I would rather play.

UPDATE: After my second play, I upgraded this to a 6. I still stand by my original statement that it's not light enough to be a filler, but it's too heavy to be so dependent on dice. Still, maybe winning my second game had something to do with it, but I am willing to play this once in a while.

An excellent game in which players use their tribal members to gather resources, raise animals, breed and build in a bid to grow their civilization.

I like this game for its simple rules yet complex game play.  Many options to go.  Great worker placement/ resource management game and works well with two.  This also has a real press you luck feel to it.  one must decide whether to be aggressive or conservative.  I also like the defensive option because you can choose options that you cannot complete just to stop others from getting them.

I may need to upgrade or downgrade this with future plays. You have a tribe of meeples, who you allocate to gathering various sorts or resources. You can build farms, or gather food to feed them, you can make tools (or more meeples), or you can get wood, clay, stone, or gold, to convert into victory points (which come in two flavours).
It has dice but feels very non-random.

Love playing this game.  Finally got bought a copy for Christmas 2011.  Yay!  Ok, so I guess the question is why?  Well this was my introduction to board gaming as the Geek knows it and my first worker placement euro game.  You always remember your first time :)
The theme, the mechanics, the quality of the pieces and board, even the start player token blew me away.

The theme is set during the stone age and your tribe is competing for resources to help build huts and cultural objects against other tribes.  You do this by sending them of to cut trees for wood, collect stone, gather gold or hunt for food each year.  We're guessing a year, because the other option you have is to expand your tribe numbers by going to the love shack.

Once your tribe has established a number of resources, you can use these to build huts to live in or expand your culture.  How well you do, is measured in victory points, which are tracked as the years progress with some additional VP's earned at the end of the game.
The person with the highest VP's win's the game.

There are worker placement games for any theme you can think of, personally, I still like playing this one because you can introduce it to non-gamer friends and still have fun.  The rules are straight forward to explain and the game length is reasonable.

I'd be hard pressed to think of a board game with more broad appeal than this one.  With literally something for everyone, Stone Age is the perfect game for a group mixed with hardcore gamers, casual players, younger siblings, and/or significant others.  I guarantee you, no one will come away bored or unhappy.

Perhaps the best introductory worker placement game out there. It has dice, easy game play, limited options, but still relatively deep strategy and different ways to acquire points. Plays awesome with any number as well!
Definitely my favourite WP game!

plenty of ways to victory, draws on the need to plan ahead, punishes you sticking too hard to your original plan..., like so many of the recent games in this type. I still like it a lot though. There's a chance factor in it that I don't like, but that it's only down side.

RATING: 8
Worker placement combined with dice rolling, that feels weird. But in this case it feels GOOD, worker placements makes you say: I want to hunt. The die tells you then how successful you are. A perfect match of mechanics and theme (apart from collecting gold in the stone age that is). Good with 2-4 players, scaling is not a problem here.

Almost as good as Viticulture, but plays a little faster because there are fewer decisions to make, but still provides a blocking ability to deny another player which makes it tense.  Simple but with depth, worker placement.  Very easy to learn and teach.

RATING: 7
A solid 7, probably deserving to be bumped near 8 or higher against other casual games. I like Pillars of the Earth (w/ expansion) much better. I would rank Stone Age higher than Age of Empires, which adds more complexity and fiddliness but not necessarily more fun. Pillars and Age are the only two other worker placement games I've played.

UPDATE: Have since played a bunch more worker placement, including Agricola and Fresco, which I both like better than Stone Age. Stone Age is very good as an intro to work placement and a casual game, but among worker placement, one of the weakest.

RATING: 7
A worker placement game. There is dice rolling in the game which introduces luck but you allocate your workers based on the probabilities of getting the rolls you need (you can also use Tools to increase your rolls) so I feel like the "luck factor" does not overcome the stategy of a person too much.

RATING: 9.13
I'm very late to the party on this game. I'd been bringing it to game night's for a very long time now. I FINALLY convinced people to play it with me and it's absolutely FANTASTIC! The game play is great and fun. It has everything a worker placement game should have. I really enjoy the dice aspect of the game where you can have a decent guess of what you'll get, but not guaranteed. There is a way to mitigate the luck with the tools and also allocating more workers when it's a very important resource that's needed. I am in love with the type of end game scoring in this game (similar to Concordia) where you are in charge of how much things will score for you based on the cards you've purchased throughout the game. However, it's also the part I liked the least solely because of just how many points there are in the end game. I got 2/3 of my points after the game was over and it really diminishes the importance of in-game points. It's really only a small issue, but it seems silly to be lapping the track 2 or 3 times.

I'm a big fan of this game. I've only played it online, so can't vouch for the board components.

It's a superb worker placement resource game, which scales very well to extra players. It involves long term planning with short term gains. So while simple to explain and play, it does require some strategy in thinking ahead. 

Dice rolls introduce some randomness, but bad rolls can also be offset somewhat by research - so this should placate those people who hate any game involving dice!

Overall, whether I've won or lost - I've always enjoyed playing and have never turned down an offer to play :)

15/2/2017 - Having now purchased and played the board game, I can say that the component and box quality are great as well. Another bonus is this is a game where there is no text on the board. Therefore, owning the German version of the game does not hinder me at all - I just download the English version of the rules and the game plays perfectly. Still one of my favorite games!

I have warmed up to Stone Age, though it has been an interesting journey. I was introduced to this game after being "long-in-the-tooth" with deeper, mechanical, and/or complex euros. Admittedly, I was curious to see what the hype was about regarding the quintessential introductory-worker placement. Leery, I admit, as I am wary of hype. I was initially impressed by its novel simplicity, and enjoyed seeing the essence of dice and worker placement of later titles down the line. A few games left a bitter taste in my mouth, due to some truly poor instances of luck. A few more plays later, taking the good rolls with the bad, I can say I genuinely enjoy this game. It has its rough edges, but I am keen to play with the right group, if just for a pleasant romp of resource gathering.

(+) Accessible gameplay with instances of indirect player interaction.
(+) Strategies are rather straightforward and clear, but cards and tools allow for some novel tinkering.
(+) Stunning production quality. The art is just eye-candy.

(-) A string of unsuccessful rolls can really sting, but you take your lumps if you play this type of game.
(-) Limited strategies--even more limited dominant strategies.
(-) Actions are wrote. Every turn, just roll and move (resources, points, cards, tokens).

Beautiful worker placement game. I usually like worker placement games, but unfortunately I simply don't enjoy playing this one. Recently I've played several times on Yucata, and have been trying to figure out why this game just doesn't work for me. 

The random dice rolls for resources are supremely irritating to me, and the relative value of the different resources doesn't appear to correlate well to the difficulty/risk in acquiring them. Lucky rolls can lead to huge scoring on a couple huts which is hard to account for. The multipliers on the cards can be overwhelming if the right ones fall into your lap. Lucky draws and rolls rule this game. It's disappointing that I don't like this game because I really wanted to like it. It seems to be a popular game, and several friends enjoy it... but the more I play it, the more I dislike it. And I didn't like it much the first time I played.

After a few plays, I still enjoy this game.  It does share features of Pillars of the Earth (send out workers to get resources), but the die roll element adds a nice touch to the overall game as nothing is so certain anymore.  Shares some elements with Catan (die rolls for production), but much more control than Catan and no trading, so players are more in control of their own fate.  With the different ways of gathering points, I can see this one getting a fair share of table time.  Besides any game with a love hut (love shack?) can't be all bad.

Seems to play well for 2-4 players, which is a nice target audience. Has a random component that seems unobtrusive. These are good things.

After a few plays, I'm beginning to feel that the "resolution" stage of each turn (after all workers are placed) takes a long time. Each player typically takes 3-5 minutes to resolve it, and the game grinds to a halt. This is a significant negative point, and one that may urge me to purge this game from the collection. These are bad things.

After a few plays, it's already getting repetitive. You acquire resources, then spend them. The trick is to focus on only a couple of things per game. The dice can be frustrating too. You can put 4 guys on a resource, roll 1, 1, 2, 3 and only get two resources. 

If you think of it as an "arcade" version of Agricola and aren't into the heavy planning games, you should like this.

13-07-2014. Rated after 1 play. Worker placement game in which you allocate people to get more guys, gather tools that help you get resources, buy buildings (VPs!) or cards. To gather resources, you roll a die for each guy you send.  More valuable resources are reflected by lower chance to get them (you roll dice, add the values and divide by a number that is higher for more expensive stuff). You use resources to buy die modifiers, buildings (VPs) and can go increase your amount of workers.

Light game, very fun. Im a bit afraid that the cards are overpowered unless everyone goes for them.

This game has a lot of popular features including cards, dice and gathering resources, making it very fun to play. Easy to teach any level of gamer, Lots of fun. One of my wife's favorite games.

However, if someone isn't rolling the higher numbers, they will be in for a miserable ride. If you consistently have to place a worker in the space that gives you tools in order to mitigate poor rolls while other players are scooping up resources and cards, you will be at a disadvantage. I have played this game enough that this issue has manifested several times.

I think this is a game you outgrow after about ten plays or so.

----------

The components are top notch, and the board is beautiful.  I like how tools are used to mitigate the negative affects of poor dice rolls.  The game itself plays much differently with 2 compared to 4:  in a 2 player game, grabbing the green cards is a must as you try to collect all 7 symbols, but it's much harder to be profitable doing this in a 4 player game due to the increased competition for those cards.  For me, the most exciting part of the game is when you must choose how many workers to dedicate to a resource:  do you play it conservatively and over-allocate to ensure you get your resources, or do you try to spread yourself thin and hope for a good roll?

However, there's just not much here for me anymore.  Gameplay is tactical, and the purchases don't lead to anything useful other than victory points -- which, to me, is boring... especially when a majority of your points are decided after the game ends.  I suppose the challenge of the game is synergizing your point-modifier cards with your civilization strengths, but I REALLY wish the huts provided more than basic victory points... such as bonuses or aids.  

Also, converting the expensive resources (rock and gold) straight to victory points via huts at a 1:1 ratio means that the resources are functionally identical.  As BGG's Johnny5 so eloquently said:  "There is zero thematic differentiation of the resources. Not in how you get them, not in what you can use them for, not in how they score. They are completely and utterly generic."

--May2008-- I really enjoyed this my first time out.  It's a very nice game merging a variety of familiar mechanics in a tight an coherent package.  The draft of scoring cards is reminiscent of Showmanager; the worker placement is a nice twist on earlier single-placement titles; and the dice mechanics are very delightful.  This is one I'll need to buy.

Munkáslehelyezés, "családi környezetben". Eléggé kiegyensúlyozott, gyönyörű grafikával (hiába,Menzel...) rendelkező társasjáték. Vonalas gémereknek nem ajánlott, mert az igazán kiélezett küzdelmeket végső soron a kockadobás dönti el, ha nagyon leszűkítjük a dolgokat. Azonban a szerencse ilyetén szerepét egyáltalán nem érzem zavaró méretünk, pl. a játékidő függvényében.
Worker Placemet-tel ismerkedőknek abszolút ajánlott! Ideálisan működik 2-3-4 fővel is. Nagyon korrekt darab. Könnyen, gyorsan, jól tanítható/tanulható. Családi játéknak tökéletes.

Most már több játék után azt mondom, hogy túlságosan "mechanikusan" játszható (erős lenne talán száraznak nevezni).

This is a really fun resource management game. It has lots of little strategies to make the game work, and the artwork is nothing short of fantastic. People seem to complain about the use of dice alot, but I just don't see why here, you roll often enough that it actually will almost always balance quite nicely.

I rate this game quite highly. Its not as complex as many other worker placements. It literally takes everyone a round to figure out all the rules. What the first playthrough teaches you is the value of how to earn points in the long game, something not apparent when you start playing. Its got quite a quick turnabout and the end phase rolling dice is quite a make or break for all players. Nice simple game with a lot of charm

And yet another worker placement game. On the good side, I like the way you can specialise in different areas to win and these all seem quite well balanced. However, of the four I've played (this one, Agricola, Age of Empires III and Pillars of the Earth), this is the one I like the least. Maybe my slightly negative feelings are a result of over-exposure to the genre. The new thing it adds is dice. I have no problem with the added randomness; the risk-management is relatively interesting. I just find the extra round of going through each player resolving their choices extends the game time without increasing the pleasure. Moreover, although towards the end of the game your productive engine should be a little larger than at the beginning, the difference is quite small and you don't have the pleasure of creating a vp machine and then watching it go. Another minus point is that it's clearly only going to work well with four.

I'll play it if it's on the table and no-one wants to play anything else, but there are many games I'd rather play than this one.

My favorite game, by far. Great eurogame, crazy big scores (if you are not good at maths you might not like adding up your score!) and lots of fun. I also like it because you have no idea who has won until the end (which for me brings the tension down allowing me to enjoy the game more) and every round feels like one step forward rather than a lost opportunity. There is always something you can do that is positive or if you want you can destroy the plans of your opponents by tactical placement of your meeples.

I don't know what's wrong with me. I wasn't amazed by this game. I think I just don't like games like Pillars of Earth, etc. Based on the same mechanism: worker-placement.

Felt a little single-dimensional for it's length (about 90-120 minutes with 4 players?). Some spots are so obviously more useful than others that almost always the first players will grab them. The farmer spot is just obviously overpowered - why should there be something in the game which is mostly a redundant no-decision. Didn't feel like there was enough tension at some points - except for last few rounds, the resource spots were almost never very scarce with 4 players. And then the good old "know when to stop investing and pressing for points" that every eurogame does. A lot of people complain about the dice, but that didn't feel like the problem - tools helped even out the occasional bad luck. Not a bad game for the first euro-game for somebody to start from - but from there on, there are more interesting and dynamic euros for this length.

    A masterpiece of game design. As of this moment, if you ask me what my favorite board game is, this would be it. I absolutely adoooore everything about Stone Age. There is nothing that it lacks. It is thematic, it is beautiful, it is simple, yet deep, and most importantly.. it has dice! All kidding aside, if you have not played this game by now you are missing out on an amazing experience. I have not even played the expansion because I do not like the fact that it removes the tightness of the base. But as a hardcore Stone Age groupie, I am considering getting it just for sport.

Seems a bit too light, a bit too much luck, to make this a great game. Maybe for a lighter game it's not too bad, but it seems odd to tack die-rolling onto what would be otherwise a high-thought Euro.

RATING: 7
not very accessible Light Euro 

This one took a bit of getting used to. I found it unremarkable and stupid at first, little control, fairly arbitrary, no theme (starvation?!) etc. SOld. Of course, those were plays with 4, where a lot of the above is true.

Got pissed off with people talking about playing it 200 times in a month, thinking that either they were Gibbering Mouther insane, or I was missing something. Took it up again online, and lo and behold, what did we have here? When played 2 player, felt like a relative of backgammon...playing dice to scratch the probabilities for one or two points above average, counting the cards played and bought, maneuvering through their strategies, finding their holes and dead ends. Lovely! After a dozen online plays I was sold, bought it again.

I only play it with 2, and only play it very competitively. It actually has some real legs, is a fun one to really dig into. Prefer to play with another hardcore Stone Age player.

And I don't call it 'feeding my people' anymore (they obviously get adequate food--no workers die, do they? you just lose points), I call it 'feasting', which is of course necessary to maintain tribal (and inter-tribal) unity. So of course not having regular feasts will penalize a tribe...instead of 'starvation strategy', I call it the 'no-feasting strategy', which of course can be useful in some game situations. Absolutely no house rules are needed to 'fix' it.

The game is fun, but technically it's very easy to exploit: push Agrculture so that you don't need to invest resources in hunting, focus on tools and remember that the progression points / resources is not linear but a power law, so that you score more points if you have one or two specialized sectors instead of trying to score points in all possible categories. Still, although not difficult, the game is always fun to play, and quick.

My rating came down from a 9, however, due to the fact that I'm much better at this game than most of my friends, and therefor don't want to subtract from their fun by beating them silly.

Next time, I won't play 300 plays over on BSW and still hope to enjoy the game with the normals.

I will almost always pick something heavier than this, and I see it's problems - luck dependance (although not as high as in Settlers of Catan), wildcard buildings are much better than others, difficulty with focusing your strategy as some spots are visibly better than others and will almost always be picked on the first round, which makes the decisions too easy and without a large overall impact. However, it's still fun to play, perhaps mostly because of nice production and a well implemented theme.

The expansion improves the game significantly by making it slightly heavier, giving you more strategic choices and making decisions less obvious.

Upon reflection I might have been a little harsh on this game.

However, it's still a little repetitive. My turn, do the same, do the same, do the same. Simple with lots of adding and dividing numbers. It feels like a cross between Pillars of the Earth and St. Petersburg - more St. Petersburg. The cards are like the aristocrats, the buildings are like buildings, we go around and around until the cards (or one of the building stacks) runs out.  We have the points counting of our aristocrats (the cards) to add at the end and we're done. Next time I'm going to play it exactly the same based on what cards come out when. If you're looking for a worker placement game then Tribune has fun, flavour, varied mechanics and all the other good stuff this game is missing. Seriously though, it's okay, I don't mind it, but I just don't feel like I've got a grand plan I'm working on or any sense of accomplishment when I win. There's no real sense that I'm slowly building or developing something. It's okay, but it feels a bit "blah" - I've counted to a lot a points, but where's the fun, where's the flavour? Reflecting on this I think it's a pity the game has been dumbed down to a collection of points and multipliers. It would have helped the theme tremendously if the buildings DID SOMETHING rather than just giving more points. My disappointment lies in the fact that it could have been so much better than an exercise in counting points.

Cute, but I don't envision it keeping my interest. I think a lot of what makes economic games interesting is the interaction between different parts. In puerto rico, you want to build buildings where the benefits stack. In Agricola, you pursue actions that increase the efficiency of other actions. In stone age, you try to maximize the efficiency of turning actions into resources. And, you try to maximize the efficiency of turning resources into victory points. Each of these decisions can be made largely independent of each other.

I usually love worker placement games, but Stone Age left me cold. Perhaps it is the emphasis and importance of the dice rolling that spoils it for me. On the other hand, and as an example, the dice rolling in Castles of Burgundy does not bother me since the rolls can easily be modified with some advance planning. Given how many others love this game I should probably give it another go.

There are some aspects of this game that would make me think it is too light/lucky based for me.  However, I don't mind it as that's just the type of game it is.  You can mitigate luck by using more or less dice in the rolls, and sometimes you just want to play a game that isn't too heavy and fun for the whole family.  Well, here you have it!  Great game to introduce new players to worker placement... MMmmm, worker placement... :)

One play, three players. Scores ranged from 289 to 196.

The game looks very nice, the components are well made and solid and I like the occasional worker placement game, but the dice rolling kills the game by adding a far too random element with every resource gathering action at their mercy.

This may be a good gateway game for the worker placement genre, but move on to something else as soon as the concept has been grasped.

Suddenly we're seeing a number of worker placement games coming out, and there's just not that much to differentiate this one from Pillars of the Earth. 

It's not bad, and I actually like the dice mechanic for getting goods, but most of the time choices seem fairly obvious. 

I also hate the mechanical feel of "The Village." The first three people almost always pick Granary, Tools, and the Barry White Hut. Yawn. I want there to be a tough and interesting decision, and those first three placements just aren't. 

I'd definitely play again--I enjoyed it (I do wish it were a bit shorter). But given a choice, I think I'd always pick Pillars over this.

Rating after one play. Four players. There were several parts of this game I enjoyed. Feeding your people, buying tools and farms, resource acquisition and of course procreation. Getting resource is a bit of a dice fest that makes you do a lot of division in your head but I didn't mind that much. The multiple paths to victory aren't bad good. I suppose over time this game plays best with aggressive players who are also willing to try new strategies. We shall see!

I was rather underwhelmed by this game. Nice artwork and quality components but it's yet another people placement game which seems to be the current fashion.Not as engaging as Agricola, Caylus or Pillars of the Earth. Easier to play than any of the above. Once you're about 4/5 turns into the game it bacomes quite straightforward, there is rarely a turn where you are seriously compromised and struggling to achieve anything. The card bonuses are huge, so naturally they disappear fast. 
Game system with added theme which could have been more carefully chosen.

16-10 (I clearly lost count at some point)
This is like Pillars of the Earth with a few layers stripped out. All the resource->VP conversions are at the same efficiency, and resource generation is based on die rolls. It's definitely a lighter, easier game than Pillars (or Caylus, which it's also compared to). In a way that's bad, because I much prefer Pillars of the Earth. But in a way it's good because people will play it - especially since it was an SdJ finalist.

RATING: 7
Fun light Euro that is far deeper than it appears, and not as luck-dependent as you would think, because the luck comes only from the order in which the cards and huts appear. The strategy can be so subtle (a wasted dice pip here, an action more efficient than you think neglected there, a combo you failed to trigger), that it was lost on me my first few plays. Excellent components were the tipping point that drove me to purchase the game, and I'm loving the decision! I wish there were fewer spots on stone and gold.

First Eurogame where I've liked it enough to become a veteran. I love how every single play is different, because the cards come out differently, and players valuate things differently. All the strategies are finely balanced, and I've seen the game won with all of them; in fact, if you go into every game with the exact same strategy, you'll get whipped. The winner is the one who sees the most viable strategy and picks and maintains it. This is truly one of the games that keeps getting better as you play more, and the great balance within really speaks to hours and hours of playtesting. Love it best with 4, because of the viability of the starvation strategy, and 3 is also good (especially since I tend to win the 3-player version). 2 is interesting, as the set-collection is all over the place, there is a huge amount of blocking, and you have to think differently in making your decisions, such that it becomes almost an entirely different game. It's still good; just be aware that it's different.

[url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/330357]Check out my review here[/url].

The mechanisms are accessible and well-tuned, which made me anoint this initially as the '4th pillar' of gateway games, but when put to the test, it flopped. Doesn't engage non-gamers or budding gamers at all. Too dry. I got rid of it.

4+3

Taking the 1 point off design because you can often feel trapped in turn order.

Birthday gift for Julia from Zack in winter of 2013

This is our favorite worker placement with resource management game that has fabulous components including a mural like game board along with wooden dice, illustrated cards and tiles, and colorful wooden cave meeples. This artful Euro plays well consistently for that kind of medium weight strategy game in about an hour and comes down to the wire at the end usually to see who wins.  I like that there are many options to acquire victory points along the way and that each player keeps their objective card victory points hidden so you won't know until the end who wins. For me the theme of being prehistoric hunters and gatherers really comes through with the hunting for food and mining of raw materials; the game has its own sense of humor too.

After getting mercilessly stomped for several games but still wanting to play I figured I'd hit upon a good game. I've hooked a couple of others onto this game and have enjoyed it with any number of players. Fairly simple to learn with a good amount of strategy. This is a game I feel I could introduce to friends who aren't into gaming so much. Also the game board is beautiful.

Light worker placement about gathering resources and building villages, set in the stone age.

Pro: Gateway to the genre, so mechanics are fairly streamlined, but still very engaging. Multiple paths to victory. Playtime is perfect. Artwork and components are great.

Con: End-game points are often worth more than double what you'd have earned during the actual game. Gets very mathy doing those moments, as well.

Stone Age is an OOP though exceptionally fun worker placement game with dice rolling to add an element of chance you must overcome with keen resource planning. It's a great entry level game for those new to Euros, yet has enough meat to keep avid gamers coming back. The artwork and components are superb though that didn't stop me from upgrading most of the stock meeples, food and resources. It's much more fun to grab a steak meeple for 10 food for your tribe after a big hunt rather than a 10 denomination token. Similarly, carrots and potatos from other ag-based games nicely replace the 1 denomination tokens you earn from the agriculture track. I thoroughly enjoy the theme, mechanics, components and expansions of Stone Age and highly recommend it others if you can still locate a copy for not too much cash.

Stone Age -- Played three- and four-player.  Good with either number of players, but it does play differently.  I prefer four, I think.  Seems to me, play is likely to be more interesting when all three of the central locations are available.  But then, the change in value of those locations is more apparent in a three-player game.

RATING: 1.5
1 play, I won (200+ points, going for shamans and tools and above average dice rolls). 

Given how I thought I would hate this game, I found the experience surprisingly pleasing. Sure everything I don't like in euros is here: the hidden sets spread sheet scoring - VP ={n*X} + {m*Y} + {o*Z} + {a^2} + B1 + B2 + ...; the bidding for actions (worker placement) with no other interaction making it a MPS. 

On the other hand it's the best looking spread sheet game I've seen and enables various caveman jokes while each player peacefully goes about their business (common map helps making MPS a tad more social). And the strategy part is good and reminds me of Power Grid - because everything is balanced the key is to go for whatever other players are not going for (though it's less obvious here). Gameplays flows smoothly (great idea of combining multiple workers on one spot to work with dice probability) as you mostly know what you'll be going for in a given turn (+ plan B and C and dump everything on D if nothing else works). I suspect repeated plays will make it less interesting and samey. So far, it's the most pleasing VP matrix I've played. 

So the experience was an 8, but I suspect the game will feel samey on repeated plays.

Despite how simplistic this game is, it has a certain charm for me. It's quick, has beautiful components, scales very well, and can be vicious fighting for slots that you need. Although terrible rolls can hamper even the best of players, a decent amount of skill is needed to do well and luck *usually* evens out. 

Stone Age may have lost is shine over time as newer games have implemented similar mechanisms with an equal amount of success, but this is still a game I can be readily convinced to play.

I really liked this game. When first hearing about this game it never caught my interest. Then i kept hearing over and over that this game is a great gateway for euro games. Seeing the game on so many lists. I tried it. I am very glad i did. the game seems harder than it is. It is easy to teach and within one round you understand how to play. Your brain will not feel fried when your you done but you feel like you had a good time. Everything seems to flow smoothly. this is a game that can be played many times and you will still enjoy playing. I think this is a must have game. This is one of those game that will showcase the reason why people should stay away from anything that has Mattel name on it.

[38 plays] I like this quite a lot. For a dice dependent game, it is more reliant on skill than many. For a worker placement game, it may be among the best for new players. Everything about it makes lots of easy sense.

Stone Age is well designed and nicely produced. There is nice tension to the decisions here. There also seems to be several routes a player can choose, although a diversified strategy isn't always bad either. (Focusing too much early energy on civilization cards is not a good move, and I am largely skeptical of any tool heavy strategy - especially with regards to tool multipliers for end game scoring.)

Although this is a favorite 2 player, it does make for a really fun and competitive 3 or 4 player game as well.

This is the best gateway worker placement game, in my opinion. There are multiple strategies you can take, but it doesn't feel like there is too much going on at the same time. The randomized cards and buildings ensures that each game will be unique. In many Euro games, I feel like I haven't accomplished anything I really wanted before the game is over. I don't feel this way with Stone Age. I always feel like I've built up an engine that is really working for me- then I just sit back and watch the points roll in at the end and see how I fared. I like that you see what cards other players take when they grab them, but then they remain hidden in their hand, so it's hard to know for sure where everyone is at with their scores until the very end. An element of surprise with end game points is always welcome with me!

Ugh. Caylus has spawned a series of games involving drafting for actions in order to gain resources and abilities to build or buy VP-awarding cards/tiles/buildings. Pillars of the Earth improved it by streamlining the system but still keeping it fairly meaty. In the case of Stone Age, the system is dumbed down even more (it's too simple for people who want a complex game, it's too complex for people who want a simple game).

As mentioned, players use their meeples to draft for actions or resources. The only ‘twists’ are the scoring system (there are cards which provide multipliers for other resources/tiles which players have bought) and the rolling of dice for resources.

Players who like the game must surely have been wowed by the inclusion of a ‘real leather dice cup!’ It’s admittedly a nice touch but the game felt overly basic and even though the system placed restriction on the choice of actions each turn, players can easily adapt strategy to mitigate that ‘agony’. Sometimes, the game actions felt almost procedural. ‘Oh, the other two players chose agriculture and tools before me’, I think I will have to just grab wood…unless the civilization card is looking attractive. Worth a play or two but Pillars of the Earth offers a richer experience in a similar length of time.

This game utilizes an interesting combination of worker placement, set collection, and some dice rolling.  As a result, the game play experience feels unique.  This game continues to grow on me with each play, but there are still few concerns that I have with the game: (1) The first few worker placements of each round are always love hut, worker tile, and food track; (2) dice rolling can be boon or bust (this can be mitigated by worker tiles, IF you can get them); (3) big points by collecting the green cards is not necessarily a good strategy since not all types may even be available during a particular game. Even though I don't love these attributes of the game, it can still be an enjoyable experience if played with the right group of people.

RATING: 9
Mechanically, the game isn't very thematic. That said, it's nonetheless an absolutely beautiful game. The art is gorgeous and the wooden bits are cute and thematic. Maybe this might be a bit shallow, but I think the great bits and art made the game easier to get into.

For the two player game, the zero-sum nature of scoring (at least, when you focus on civ cards) short circuits much of the on-the-fly math. It's not onerous, even for Michelle. The trickier part is knowing which village space to take when (opportunity cost and benefit varies depending on what else is going on), and when to grab wood. The emphasis on proper timing reminds me a lot of Jaipur. 

After crushing Michelle in ...  too many games, I decided to personally coach her (instead of just directing her to the strategy section of BGG). The next game I won on the tie-break, which was a pretty huge improvement for her. I may have reduced the fun for her a bit though? She says the game isn't actually what she thought it was about, and what it is now isn't as exciting as what she thought it was. I guess we'll see what she thinks a few games down the line, since she does like Jaipur quite a bit.

I remember reading somewhere that strategy for Stone Age is extremely sensitive to player count. We played a few games with 3 this holiday season, and it definitely feels different. I am much, much worse at the game with 3 players, and Michelle is better. She doesn't change the way she plays at all, so apparently her normal strategy is somehow not tuned for 2p. I guess we already sort of knew that, though.

This game was the gateway game that got me into the hobby. You're a tribe leader sending out your villagers to do work to progress your village. It's fun seeing your village grow and you'll feel stronger as the game goes on. You'll also push your luck as you'll rely on some dice rolls to roll high. It's simple, yet theres a good amount of depth to give it a nice replay value. At the time, I didn't know anything about the hobby, let alone the bgg rating system but I knew I was playing something special. Unfortunately this game is quite rare as it is out of print and it's the one game I regret not owning. Fortunately a friend of mine has it!

A bit too similar to other games to be great, but a solid game.  My only gripe is that, in a game with restricted action due to other players utilizing those actions, the random factor of the cards is a bit unfitting.  One can play a hut building, tribe multiplication, or tool monopolization strategy with little luck required, but striving for the cards can fail on luck alone.  So there's a bit of a risk/reward imbalance there, but all in all a well made game.

It's a good game, but I'm afraid everyone wants to decode the perfect solution.  That's good, but I wonder if it will have lasting power do to this.  The 300 point total seems reachable, although the game could be won with as few as 100+.  The card acquisition strategy seems to be quite powerful unless the majority of players are attempting the same thing.  I guess a player might have to acquire a few cards for defensive point blocking opportunities too.  There are no animals in this game either, although a few of the little meeples can seeming transform into little beavers and termites to eat the lumber or among other things when the food gets too low.  The constant food production seems annoying and unfun.  The game has lots and lots of dice situations, but there is no true confrontation.

I think the game could use a nice cannibal or raiding party variant...

Excellent game, less complicated than Terra Mystica but many possibilities about resource gathering. I love the random aspect of collecting resources. Civ cards + huts draw order adds a great touch of variability between games. Upgrading agriculture asap is something to remember. Great game to introduce resource management.

------------
Update Nov. 19th : Ended up trading this game away.
Great game to introduce new gamers to worker placement. The art is wonderful. It has depth/different possible winning strategies, but all of them start by rushing village actions (tools/farming) before they are all taken then spending ressources in different ways. We now enjoy playing heavier games in which there is more liberty to do what you what and in which order.

A solid gateway to worker placement, with pleasant, endearing components.

I Love This Game. Got it after viewing it on TableTop. Very worth it, a great game. Good resource allocation game, lots of fun elements, good strategies.

RATING: 7
Only played with 4 players. Turn order is very important at that player count, and the main cause of randomness when good tiles come up, not the dice like you'd expect.

Rules are mostly good, but I don't like that the rules officially state to keep your purchases as hidden information (trackable). Luckily no one I've played with so far acknowledges that rule. -1 point for design.

Pretty fun game, seem to be quite a few viable strategies (and you must adapt based on what comes out so it probably stays fresh for a while). Ultimately though it seems to mostly be about counting/math

RATING: 6
This is a wonderful illusion of a game.  There are many things here to distract you as you try out different permutations of placement trying to best the odds in differing ways.  When you first read the rules, it is clear that it is yet another action selection engine builder created with the sole purpose of earning Victory Points.  Fine.  So after you pretend that this will be ok, the dice add an element of fun, and the whole thing just works, albeit in a silly way.  But as the game progresses the vernier runs thin.  It becomes a bit long for how dicey it is, the light fun becomes tedium as the game devolves into repetition.

I would gladly play this again if there was only a stack of 5 or 6 huts per pile.  This will cut down on the play time to prevent it from overstaying its welcome.  Also this way you won't max out on farming, it will force tougher decisions of instead of always opening in the village you will have more incentive to open with getting the cards.  Now knowing when to get the cards (as there will likely be fewer in the game) will be essential.  The greatest advantage to a shorter game is that it makes the starving strategy much less viable as they shouldn't have time to get their engine going.

The starving strategy just feels wrong to me. 

It was still pleasant enough.  I wouldn't turn the game down outright if offered, just to try only going for wood and cards.

This game is actually fun.


**** 5-29-2011 Swear when I first saw Stone Age and its rating, thought 'hey, this must be good.'
So, I picked it up, and sadly it just does not get played. No one wants to play it.

Stone Age through the fog apparently is just a long math problem. Add this, add this to this, divide, divide, divide.

Also the dice cup smells rank. Threw it out right after I opened the package. 'Bleh!'

Played it last week at a game night and was hoping to play it again this week. No luck. Probably going to buy this tonight because I believe it is a great game to play with non-gamers and serious gamers. I play many versions of chess (10x8 gothic chess, 10x10 grand chess, Fischer random chess, Go ) along with deeper strategy games like Shogun,Warrior Knights,Rune Wars and Mage Wars, but after playing this game I realized the fun in simpler games that don't burn your brain and have random elements in them like dice rolling and card drawing/flipping. It might become repetitive after 25 plays but for $50, that's a bargain in my book. A really nice package that is needed in my collection.

RATING: 9
Took me exactly 21 tries to chalk up a victory in this game (one face-to-face and 20 on BSW) and the most salient point about my "9" rating is the extent to which I loved the journey.

This is one terrific game with just the right touch of 'brain burn' to elevate it above the level of common.

There is a need to balance in-game acquisition of VPs (by obtaining buildings) and the necessity of developing bonus multipliers (with civilization cards) that will score points in the end. The genius of the game is in this balance; understanding it and being able to execute it when opponents are constantly narrowing your options at every turn. Hard to settle in to the idea of moving your marker along the food track in a 4-player game, when three out of four times, those who go ahead of you claim the space. You need to stay nimble and adjust your tactics according to the options available to you when it's your turn.

There's a degree of 'down time' associated with this game, related to the process of both placement and resource collection. In many cases, if you're going last in a 4-player game, especially playing face-to-face, you could almost go out to lunch before your turn comes around. There is no advantage to paying attention to what others are doing because it won't be affecting the decisions you've already made (placement) or the actions you'll take when it is your turn (collection). Were it not for the fact that certain civilization cards being collected by opponents afford you the opportunity to select resources for your own use, you could tune out of opponent play altogether. Not a significant issue, though. There's more tension in the placement than there is in the collection process and with a group that's familiar and on the ball, things move pretty quickly.

A deceptively easy game to learn and play, although its proficiency learning curve is lengthy ("So easy," notes one 'room' on BSW, "even a caveman could do it."). Someone can explain the whole 'balance' thing a hundred times, but unless you 'feel it out,' in practice, it's not going to sink in. First few times through, one is unlikely to understand the importance of any given building or civilization card and how decisions at any given point have to be made with regard to an overall plan of action.

As noted previously, though, it's a great journey and with a group of like-minded and -experienced players, this is a terrific middle weight game.

I expected to dislike this game, but it surprised me. Very simple worker-placement mechanism allows the player to tilt the odds of getting needed resources one way or the other. Outcomes are usually based on the sum of lots of dice, which means tight distributions and more predictable payoffs. This is much better than the typical dice game (e.g., Settlers) where one very flat-distributed die roll can crush you.

Really enjoy this game. I also enjoy Kingsburg which involves dice rolling as a key mechanic but just like Kingsburg you have enough control over the 'randomness' that it never really becomes an issue. If you desperately need a high number you can add more dice or use tools to automatically boost your roll. The different strategies and randomness of the cards and buildings keep each game fresh. It's also really easy to teach people as the mechanics involved are very straight forward. A good board game is one in which you make a series of interesting decisions and that's exactly what you get with this game. I guess it just doesn't appeal to some people but I find it to be a lot of fun. It doesn't hurt that the pieces are also really well designed and made either.

Another worker placement game in the vein of PotE, ItSotE and Caylus but with two new and neat twists: 1. Varied order of actions after selection versus ordered or immediate 2. Dice rolling for food and resources. It was light, encouraged table talk and played in about 2 hours. All great features. I would like to try the 4 player version as I think it would make for a tighter game. The game sugggests to play Civ cards face down and I am not sure how I feel. I think it worked but I had no sense on how anyone else was doing, one feature that irked me.

Simple, fun, and fast-playing. Take the best parts of Caylus, and roll them into a richly-illustrated game. It has many ways to win. (But did people really pan for gold during the stone age?)

After further plays, I wonder if the balance is off for some of the options. In my latest game, I ignored feeding my people altogether; instead I just procreated and built buildings and grabbed cards for People and Buildings. I won by a landslide.

From now on, we will be doubling the penalty for not feeding your people: -10 VP for your first offense, -20 VP for the second, etc.

This is a good worker placement game where the risk in dice rolling can be, to a limited extent, mitigated.

The components are great, and it's interesting how the dice play a role in the game.  I enjoy playing it, but it's missing a little something to give it the pizazz required to rate it higher.  I think if there was a way that more than one player (at increased cost) could get tools, food production or have babies, it would make for more of an interesting, tense game.

UPDATE: After playing it for the first time in a long time, I realize that behind the chrome, there really isn't something great here and it is indeed missing the nice little element to make this more intriguing. I find it long for what it is, and would never play it with 4, and only occasionally with 3.

Decent gateway worker placement game with great components, but too long, and not enough variability. I feel that the multipliers on the cards are too large; they make end-game scoring determinative rather than important, and that trivializes scoring during the game, which means you don't have a good idea of how well you're doing until the end, unless you count cards. So you pick your strategy at the start, stick to it, and hope you come out on top. I liked it a lot at first, but my enthusiasm dwindled with each play, as with worker placement games in general. Agricola is better.

Very nice going game. You always seem to have enough choice - even if the best choices are taken, you can always get more resources which will speed you later.

Nice tension between the people you gather, to the food you need to feed them.

It seems the score difference between the winner and the loser is very small - the entire game revolves around 20 or so points difference - so the game is actually a game of tactical maximization on every axis.

RATING: 7
Like Pillars of the Earth with a stone age theme: you allocate workers to various areas on the board in order to collect resources and then to convert them into points. The VP generation is more straightforward than Pillars, generally with simple recipes and a direct pips-to-points conversion scheme (with one exception: the civ card symbol set-collection). The major difference, other than theme, is that resource production is based not only on who got to the location first (some locations have only limited space for worker meeples), but on dice rolls.

This is probably my favorite of the lighter worker-placement games (Age of Empires would likely top my list of heavier worker-placement games): plays quickly (online, at least) and the luck of the dice is somewhat manageable. Still, I wonder if the game would be better:
- if it used averaging dice (2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5) instead of standard d6's?
- if some of the huts or cards gave you ongoing powers of some kind?

Long ago in prehistoric times cavemen used to roll DICE to acquire gold and other resources that they were immediately able to convert into huts and playing cards.

One of the best new games I have played in quite a while.  My favorite so far of 2008 and right up there with Phoenicia, my favorite from 2007.  I'm intrigued to see how it will hold up-if one strategy seems to always work, such as focusing on either the cards or huts.  If so, I can see my rating slipping.  If not, a ten is a possibility here.  The rules are straightforward and the selection mechanic reminds me of Leonardo da Vinci.  The dice, coupled with the division rule for obtaining different commodities, add a nice bit of randomness and excitement.  I should have known I would like a game from the same designers as St. Petersburg!

RATING: 5
Next to Carcassonne, this is the game I most don't get the popularity for.  It is an extremely bland by-the-numbers worker placement game.  Each turn players collect resources which they use to fill orders, build structures, and feed their workers.

It doesn't add anything to the worker placement formula and it isn't even an old game.  By 2008 when this was released there were already several popular worker placement titles that did new and interesting things.  This game should be buried in a discount bin somewhere, not on the front page of the Geek.

Sure, it's simple and light, which makes it a reasonably decent gateway game to teach worker placement mechanics.  But again, there are much better accessible worker placement games available such as Lords of Waterdeep and Fresco.  A game can be simple while also doing new and interesting things with the mechanics.

It's not a BAD game by any means, there's just no point to it.

I love worker placement, but I don't care for dice as much as some.  However, in Stone age you feel there's more of a sense of control and there's clever ways to combat the pure 'luck-be-damn'd' crap roll.  The family really enjoys this one and they're much more competitive here than with Agricola, so I have a blast playing this with them.

BestWith:4>3>2. Gorgeous map. Must modify box so top closes right. Designer says starvation strategy is a viable option (analysis says perhaps at 7+ workers). Proposed variants (not needed): -4 VPs per missing food (Czech version) -5 VP per starved worker (Larry Levy, no longer used)

It's a good game. Very well produced with fine components. The theme is very abstract.
It's fun enough to see the table now and then. I only think that maybe it drags for too long. I have to play it again soon to see if cards are really much more important than buildings. I guess they are!

Played again with four players:
It's better with four players than with 2. It flows better. The thing is that this is one of those games that need experienced players. It's a good way to introduce people into play but for a totally balanced game it needs full experienced players.

Michael Menzel made a good job on the art work of this game. It works pretty well and the components are excellent.
The game play is very simple and straightforward but I'm really starting to think that the options are not enough to make this game interesting for many plays. It results the same play after play - usually cards make the difference.
Also, picking the food increase and the worker growth seem to be the most obvious choices at the start mid game making it a bit dull.
Still a fun simple game to be played a couple of times for year.

It's really fun to build up your little village and try to time when to build up resources and when to buy the various cards and buildings which actually give you points. In most games the points come in waterfalls and end-game bonuses so that you never quite know if you are winning or not. Great fun. The components are nice and the leather dice-rolling cup is a great touch.

For now 7 points but I am very sure this rating will change, not sure if for the better or worse. I find Stone Age difficult to judge, I am actually not sure if I like it or not, since I am willing to play more I am obviously intrigued. 
It is a game with a strong learning curve, which on the downside means mixing experienced and new players does not go very smoothly. But for players on the same level it is an interesting experience. A worker placement where you have to figure out the best strategy. There is a bit luck involved in the draw of new cards and the dice roll (when you determine whether you earned any goods this round), normally I do not mind luck to a degree but this game is so strategy heavy that the luck is sort of random and unfair. It bugs me.
But the game draws you in when it challenges you to find the best strategy to get the most points. At first I found it a bit overwhelming but exactly the diversity in placing opportunities makes it interesting. It sure has its appeal but I am not sure if it the right one for me. Time will tell.
Full point up, it did indeed grow onto me :-)

Light worker placement game.  Victory points are tracked only partially while the game is in progress, so you have to watch what your opponents are doing.  The theme is pretty pasted on.  However, the components are VERY nice, and helps the theme a lot: pretty board, shaped painted wooden pieces, leather dice cup.

What a nice surprise was this game!
I tought it's dull (because of the theme), but actually it's pretty fun and exciting.

I enjoyed playing it online (only 2-P), but after some plays I noticed a disturbing problem: until the final counting you have no idea who will win and how many points you have! During the game everybody buys a bunch of hidden special cards what can dramaticaly change the final scores.

Gifted game. played several time prior to joining BGG.  what a gem.  our gaming friends birthday gifted this to me and its been in rotation.  probably our first worker placement game and we've loved the mechanic ever since, leading to waterdeep, pillars of the earth, lancaster and ninjato(the last 2 sorta worker placement, i've seen discussions).  anyway, there's lots to love.  the battle for civ cards, who's growing their families, who's increasing the farming, who's gathering the huts.  and the randomness of the cards is what makes it interesting.  who is willing to bypass the wheat hut for a juicy 3x hutbuilder card as an example.  oh no, i lost track of who has picked up the most invention cards and do they need that one, and are they willing to pay 4 resources for it?  some of the things you get to think about during play.  the expansion we doubted it was needed, but we discovered we played some things incorrectly and once remedied, the expansion is great.  plus it adds a 5th player.  what's not to love.  trading does help and i get up that chart as quickly as i can, again all dependent on our my opponents play.

RATING: 7
This is almost the archetype of worker placement games: your playing pieces are action points and you take turns placing them among the menu of options. The board is a nicely painted bird's eye view in vaguely isometric perspective and has enough little details to distract from it's abstract nature. After a number of plays, I've managed to perfect a losing strategy.

After one play, I liked this better than I thought I would.  It seemed like the mechanics are the same I have seen in many other places, but I enjoyed the game play more than many of the those other games (Caylus, for example).  It is VERY hard to tell who is winning, so the end game scoring is a bit wild - but still fun.

Stone Age has no real flaws and would be my example of an all-round game. It has enough depth to be strategic and therefore appeals to seasoned players, but appeals to newcomers as well through its relative simplicity and its elegant design. All this is further complemented by stunning artwork and component quality. Stone Age features the best looking board I have ever seen, and even includes a high quality leather cup to roll dice with. Despite this, while adequate, theme is probably its weakest aspect, with the worker-placement and dice-rolling mechanics being both the most prominent and the least thematic aspects of the game. Nonetheless, Stone Age is a very good and enjoyable game for a wide audience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A great worker placement game that is simple enough to teach to new gamers, but has enough meat to it to be appealing to seasoned gamers.  I really appreciate that there are various parts of the game you can focus on to try to achieve victory so that now every game is the same. Theme is very strong in this game.  WARNING - If you do not like dice, do not play this game!

Oh yes, yet another worker placement game. I'm beginning to tire a bit of the genre. Stone Age is a decent game by all accounts, but I just can't get that excited anymore. After three plays, I suspect that there are just too few roads to victory. The big points are all in the cards; the huts just don't cut it. I hope to be proven wrong in subsequent plays. For now, I prefer Pillars of the Earth.

A fantastic worker placement game. Several different strategies to win and they will all work depending on how each specific game plays out. It takes a few play throughs to a good handle on the strategies but the dice make enough of a random factor that the super experienced don't have an insermountable advantage.

Also a great production value with the leather cup for rolling dice. A wonderful stone aged theme.

A very good game, we play this with the family (11yr and 8yr old) they understand it well and often manage to win. Fun, depth and beautiful. At Essen 2010 I bought 5x10 colored dice with which we replaced the wooden meeples, which is much more efficient. (apr 2011 kids are now 10 and 7 and are still loving this game to pieces) We play the game with the extra huts, the game improves even more with those huts.

The first thing that strikes you when you set up this game is the artistry of the game board, tiles, cards, etc.  It definitely leaves a positive first impression when you see the attention to detail that went into the graphic design.  As for the game play, it is a pretty straight-forward take on the now-popular "worker placement" genre, and I do enjoy its relative simplicity and the multiple paths to victory.  And yes, I even enjoy the random element of dice rolling for the resources, since it adds a bit of excitement and risk/benefit analysis when determining the number of workers to place.  Over-all, its a decent, well-designed game that I would definitely play again but don't enjoy quite enough to go out and purchase.  Game design:  4.5/5  Personal enjoyment:  3/5  Total:  7.5/10

RATING: 4
This should be the poster-child for spreadsheet game: take turns incrementing values in columns A and B, calculate column C as A*B, then sum it at the end of the game. Insofar as there is any excitement, it is intended to come from exclusive worker placement -- oh no, the first player has added one to cell A2 and now I can't! -- and from the fact that resources are harvested via dice rolling. (As though I needed to care less about who won.)

There's a smidgeon of development (one of the rows is additional workers, and one lets a player modify the harvest dice), a frisson of pain (pay 1 food per worker per round or lose points), and a minor set collection element, but the game as a whole is an extremely slight and unbearably dull exercise in choosing between options running the gamut from tolerable to acceptable.

Like the other big Bernd Brunnhofer designs, the theme is so shallow that the (primary school) maths shows through, but this time it lacks the tension of St. Petersburg or even the combination of spatial blocking and engine building in Pantheon.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Sort of Agricola, but lighter and less unforgiving. If you feel Agricola is like playing football in a phone booth (which isn't properly a bad thing), this might be your pick.
The only downside is the techs and buildings feel a little dry, I wish I could build the Granary or the Temple instead of the 12vp-1stone-2wood-hut.

Discovered this game at our first Cancon games convention in Canberra, where we were given a taster play demo. Very enjoyable. 

Fun collecting resources and experimenting with different strategies. Game drags a little with 4P but excellent 2P. Haven't tried 3P. Tends to lose out to Agricola these days.

Update: 3P works great, better than 4P which was still great but made it drag out to the point of overstaying its welcome. But that may be due to teaching it to new players.

I understand why other people like this game, but is just does absolutely nothing for me.  The theme is paper thin and is boring to me, and the scoring mechanisms are somewhat (and needlessly) convoluted.  Perhaps Stone Age is just a deeper game than I anticipated and it will take a few plays for me to "get it." Unfortunately nothing about the game compels me to invest those extra plays to find out.  Simply put, playing this game is not an enjoyable experience for me so I have no desire to play it again.

Light Euro/family that uses dice as resource gathering tool.

+ Light - Simple compared to other Euros.
+ Artwork - Fantastic as with most of Menzel's art.
+ Different strategies - Choose between card goals or hut building or combine both.
+ Thematic - Most mechanics well fitted to theme.

- Random - Too many bad rolls can mean disaster.
- Card balance - Some cards are simply broken compared to others. This imbalance irritates me most. One card gives x3 modifier to your hut count, another x1, with no other differences. I find this design flawed.

RATING: 7
[RGG 'Stone Age' 08 edition w/ Spielbox-Almanach expansion hut tiles] {Civilization; dice-rolling, resource management, utility cards; optimal 4p}  Stone Age is a great family gateway game.  It has a nicely executed theme.  It's intuitive enough to learn.  The strategy is clear enough that players shall have no difficulty in understanding what's happening in the game.  And, players shall know what to do next or what actions/resources to choose.  In addition, scoring happens occasionally - most players would have a rough understanding about the game progress.  Nonetheless, the civilization cards give some hidden score so that the game keeps engaging until the end.  Luck is not very strong, even though dice are heavily used.  Stone Age is sort of multifaceted but I think civilization cards are just too important to be ignored.  The game time is approximately 60 minutes, which is suitable for family games.

There is much player interaction; especially with 4 players. Players have to compete for resources, civilization cards, huts, etc.  And, players need to pay attention for what other players are doing; otherwise, they would slip away golden chances to the opponents to get scores.

The component quality is real nice.  The people meeples are nicely shaped.  The illustration of cards and board is colorful.  The cards and huts are informative enough.  The resources tokens are nicely shaped!  However, the packing is real stupid - I have to cut the box insert to put in the player boards nicely.

This is one of the great gateway games.

Erano tempi duri. I nostri antenati lavoravano sodo, sforzando gambe e schiena con l’aratro di legno nella terra rocciosa. Per fortuna il progresso non si è fermato all’aratro di legno: gli uomini hanno sempre cercato utensili migliori e piante più produttive per migliorare la resa del proprio lavoro. I giocatori rivivono questa epoca e, come fecero i nostri antenati, raccolgono la legna, lavorano la pietra e setacciano i fiumi in cerca d’oro. Commerciano liberamente, espandono il proprio villaggio e, in questo modo, raggiungono nuovi livelli di sviluppo e civilizzazione. In questo avvincente e affascinante gioco, dove la fortuna è ben bilanciata dalla strategia, i giocatori sono in competizione per le risorse e per il cibo. Rischia e cresci, come fecero i nostri antenati: solo in questo modo la vittoria ti sorriderà!

A 2011 Christmas gift that has made it to our table a lot this year (as you can tell).  Easily one of the best new games we have purchased with great art work, ease of game play, and plenty of wonderment about how best to win.  Our first 3-player game was equally great.

RATING: 5
Its good to have a dice game where I feel like I'm controlling the dice rather than the dice controlling me. An easy game to learn with superb pieces and board. This has plenty of depth.
Edit - Just not enjoying it as much now. The blend doesn't work for me. I'd rather be playing Kingsburg, and have some intersting decisions to make.

RATING: 7
Caylus/Agricola light.  It's got a beautiful board, great components and is much easier to teach than Caylus or Agricola (both substantially better games imo).  As such I would call it a 2nd Tier Gateway game... a way to get people that already like games to take a step towards the more complex titles without getting overwhelmed with moving parts and pieces.

Moves along at a really excellent pace with moderate down time and relatively little set up each round (which can be a little annoying with Agricola).

RATING: 9
This is a great strategy game.  It is simple enough to learn quickly and I definitely see it taking a while to master.  The components are perfect, and the layout fits.  I would recommend this game to anyone who likes playing strategy (resource collection and management) games.

RATING: 5
Interesting game, but I dislike how much dice rolling and luck there is in it. Would be more fun if there were more paths to victory, but there seem to be only a few dominate strategies that always win out.

EDIT: After more plays I don't mind the dice rolling so much as it averages out over the course of the game. However, player turn order with no control over it is very problematic. The "roll one per player and everyone takes one" is very dependent on turn order. Same for a lot of other action spots and cards which just come down to being unlucky in turn order. If there was a way to control turn order I'd probably rate the game a 6, but without that it pushes it below average to a 5.

Fantastic intro to worker placement!  I very much enjoy this game.  Light in nature, and the rolling of dice proves that even further.  At it's best when introducing new players to the 'next level' of games.  Ones with a bit more thought and management.  With the fact that you need to feed your people every round can get you on 'the food game' sometimes, but that's part of learning.

Mind numbingly unmeasurable game
First play I thought, yeah I like this.
But you cannot tell who is winning until the final count up.
After more plays you realise this inability to know whether you are winning, or not, begins to hollow out your soul. All the thinking and agonising and just not knowing.
For the masochist or those who dont care whether they win or loose as long as they can disrupt an opponents intended play. Very much for the sado/masochist.

RATING: 7
Worker placement dice roller set in pre-historic times. The game is based around the collection of resources, which is achieved by sending workers to various areas (forest, quarry, hunt etc). Once all workers have been assigned to an area dice are rolled depending on how many workers have been placed in an area and this determines how many resources are acquired. The object of the game is to survive by collecting enough food for the workers but also gaining points for constructing huts with the resources and gaining point from cards that can also be obtained. The game is interesting enough but you never get far away from the realisation that you're depending on quite a lot of luck when rolling dice for resource production. It's solid, straightforward and nothing special.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This game is often pitched as a non-gamer or gateway game. That's true in every aspect except for all the iconography on the huts and civilization cards, which makes quickly understanding the game a lot harder. 

Being a newbie boardgamer as of writing this, I have found as a personal preference that I don't like game mechanics where the first round plays more or less like the last one and you mostly gather "useless" victory points. Stone Age has this mechanic. Yes, there are upgrades but the base gameplay is the same on all turns.

Another small minus is the high amount of victory points which can reach up to more than 200. For some that might be a plus as tension is kept up until the end after all points are counted but I'm more fond of a much smaller range of victory points.

All in all still a good game though, especially if my dislikes don't put you off.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Played 3+ times.  Definitely a dice game, but you can do things to minimize the effect of the luck.  Definitely tactical elements surrounding getting people and fields.  My right hand neighbor LOVED fields and I only ever got them when going first, he had twice as many fields as I by the end, very frustrating, I wasted many actions hunting while he actually ended up making food on the last couple turns.  He beat us soundly with ~230 while second through 4th were in the 170-160 range.  

Totally unrelated question: Is there a first player advantage?  2008/11/05  **UPDATE**  I don't enjoy playing this.  I don't really dislike it but I would rather play something else.

This is a great game with several routes to winning (making a big tribe, green card base bonuses, tools to add pips etc). Agriculture track is a must though!!

Although every now and then the dice can destroy a turn (send 4 tribesmen to hunt and only gain 2 food!!!) this is a fun twist on the usual worker placement style 'go and collect resource'.

RATING: 6.5
Good lightweight Euro game. Has everything a euro should have: limited workers + a mechanic to get more, limited actions where you try to be first to, resource gathering, bonus conditions, multiple strategic paths to victory, meaningfull tactical choices.

Cannot really rate this well as I only played one two-player game. Everything did work, but it doesn't really shine as a two player game as the game 'shut down' a lot of options leaving something to desired for complexity. Will try this out with 4 as well, I'm guessing it will be much, much more interesting while staying lightweight.

Together with Alien Frontiers, this one is highly recommended as a gateway Euro!

[SEP 2016] Traded it off, as it simply is not engaging enough, even playing 4. Too friendly, not constricting enough lets you cruise through a game without feeling challenged or really engaged.

Stone Age is a fantastic game.  It plays casual or tense if you want it.  You don't get screwed too bad on a turn because there are so many options.  Beautiful board and pieces.  Plays in a respectable amount of time. This will always stay in my collection. 

I will say that the fun of dice rolling will turn against you at critical moments unless you can minimize the risk involved.  If you must have perfect information, then you better stay away.

Seems like a hodge podge of typical euro games: rolling dice, collect cards for pts, construct an abstract tribe of wood/stone/gold gatherers to generate victory pts. etc. Somehow it all sort of works. The die rolling is more a calculated risk and doesnt seem to detract. What I dont like and feel will shorten the lifespan is that you have to know what is on the civilization cards  and when to take them. This may become formulaistic and take the fun out of the game. Play time is a little long for the amount of real decisions/excitement.

What a great game.  Nice and simple mechanic that leads to a number of ways to accumulate points.  The multiplier scoring is especially nice.  Nice theme and it's very well produced.

WOW! I love this game! First of all, it looks beautiful. The art work is absolutely superb on the game board and cards. The components are excellent - all the tribes people,little logs, clay bricks, chunky stones and bars of gold are really delightful. Game play is quick and easy to pick up and plays in 60 - 90mins which is a great time slot for gaming with Emma my wife after work. Decisions are plentiful but not too brain burning which makes this very accessible for younger players or non-gamers but strategies are subtle and varied depending on opponents and circumstances. This means replayability is high. This is probably my favourite game right now and I can see me playing this reguarly for the foreseeable future. (24/8/08)

This game scores highly because it is simply one of the best games in the middleweight field.  It looks terrific, the bits are top notch (and there are loads of them), the theme is rock solid. The game play has a good dose of tactics, some strategy, and a soup-son of luck - just enough to make it terrific fun.  The biggest compliment I can give this game is that it is slick, slick, slick - no downtown, fast playing, lots to think about, some good player interaction. Very popular with my game group and family.

Worker Placement at its best!
Gorgeous theme and artwork, and good materials. I just love that!
It's not too heavy, but still strategic. It's in a really good spot for a family game.
Some people say the dice rolling for gathering resources is too random, but I think it fits the theme: Life is hard in the stone age! And there are enough ways to mitigate the dice rolls.
I think the game is more about enjoying the theme than about playing competitively.
There aren't many games out there that contain a "love shack"! ;)

in short:
++ theme
++ gorgeous artwork and illustration
+ mechanics
++ great materials (You even get a leather dice cup!)
- game balance problems (e.g. turn order with weaker players, start player advantage, swingy cards, ...)

An excellent worker placement game.  Easy to teach and enjoyable to play.  The dice mechanic for gathering is an excellent use of randomness to determine a result.

A szabály alapján sokkal bonyolultabbnak tûnik, mint amilyen valójában. De egyszerûsége ellenére a játékélmény jó. Egyre jobban tetszik...
Tény hogy a játékban ha valaki rááll valamilyen kombinációra sokat nyerhet a játék végén a civilizációs lapokkal. Azonban pont ezért jó hogy a játékosok büntetlenül lefoglahtanka helyeket mások elől, mert így a játékosok rá vannak kényszerítve arra, hogy másokra is odafigyeljenek.

2011.07: Pont abban áll a játék nagyszerűsége, hogy nagyon oda kell figyelni a többiekre: el kell előlük happolni azokat a civilizációs kártyákat, amelyekkel nagyot kaszálhatnak

2011.08 Pontosítom az előző kijelentést. Nem lehet elvenni mások elől azokat a lapokat amikkel ők jól járnának, hiszen nem éri meg. Az egész játék arról szól, hogy a játékosok ráállnak valamilyen "témára" (házak számának szorzói, emberek szorzói, stb) és melyikük "kombója" fog több pontot hozni. Szerintem civilizációs kártyák nélkül nem lehet megnyerni ezt a játékot, de a civilizációs kártyák gyűjtése mellett nem szabad lemaradni nagyon a pontozósávon. Kiegyensúlyozott játék esetén (amikor minden játékos nagyjából egy szinten van) a zöld civilizációs kártyák szinte biztos győzelmet jelentenek, ha a játékos össze tudja gyűjteni az összeset de még 7-tel is jó esély van arra hogy nyer.

Awesome artwork and I love the theme. On the high level, this is a "Gather-Resources-And-Spend-Them-For-VPs" game. I like how you Gather Resources; you allocate X guys to the Forest to gather Wood, and then roll Xd6. Divide by 3 (For Wood) and that's the number of Wood you gather. This adds a Risk Management aspect to gathering resources - should I allocate 3 guys in the Forest to guarentee at least 1 Wood, or should I risk it and allocate 1 guy and hope to roll 3+ on a 1d6? Also like the aspect of growing your tribe and feeding them - the larger the tribe the more you need to feed them. What I didn't like about - the "Huts" which you purchase for VPs. These simply denote Resource combis to earn VPs - there are no special abilities, no effects, nothing when you build a Hut apart from earning VPs. I'd have liked it if different types of huts gave you different types of abilities, like say a Woodcutter's Hut gives you a +1 to your dice rolls in the Forest, etc. Also didn't like the "hidden bonus VPs" which come into effect at the end of the game. To make things worse, these are multipliers which double, triple, quadruple, etc. your score in a certain aspect (eg. Bonus VPs = the number of meeples you have x 2). These add a HUGE number of VPS to players at the end, so much so that the end scores tend to be fairly skewed.Overall, it's a nice game with great artwork, but I felt that "spend resources for VPs" parts of the process to be fairly flat.

Pillars done right. No programming of stages: the game doesn't need it since more powerful cards just can't be used to full effect early on. Many paths to victory: freeing meeples by increasing food production or producing more meeples ("When two meeples who love each other very much go to the love shack....") Concentrating on green-bottom cards. Concentrating on one or a couple sand-bottom cards. Combinations of the previous. One cannot control the game using resources as can be done with Caylus or CMC: the problem is converting all your resources to points--it usually cannot be done close to exactly.

Nice game, but heavily depending on luck, with no compensation for bad dice rolls.
Strategy is mostly a matter of understanding what other players are doing and then follow a different strategy (heavily reminding St.Petersburg).
Really overrated imho it's not that different from Airship (Giganten), for instance. Still, a solid decent game.
Starving strategy is "against the spirit" of the game, and should not have been implemented imho.

If you've played other worker placement games and disliked the fact that you can count on what resources you'll come away with, then this game is for you. Two players putting the same number of workers on the same spot can walk away with pretty different outcomes for resources. Since these resources turn in to points, there's a whole game that has the final outcome decided by random rolls. Oh sure, your strategy will help you along, but your die rolls become the random kingmaker.

FEB 2009 - Played @ EGG 2009 - This is a great light- to medium- weight resource management game. I think it's likely to be more accessible to new gamers and kids than the more typical Euro fare. I've played twice so far and love it. Downtime is low and there's lots to do, even if someone takes your first choice. Many options for paths to victory here!

I really like this game. The artwork is beautiful and there are multiple valid strategies to follow. For me, the civilization cards are what makes this game so cool. They are so important for strategy reasons, and they make a HUGE impact on final scoring. Civilization cards seem to make up about half of the final score and that score is kept secret until the game is over. As an archaeologist I love the theme of this game. Wood, clay, and stone are the three most used resources in this game and that's pretty accurate for hunter gatherers. I also like how improving tools is important for increasing resource yield and how during the game you make a transition from hunting/gathering to agriculture.

Solid game with a great theme. The luck of the dice rolling can be annoying, but not overly so. It has depth without an overwhelming number of rules. My only complaint is downtime.

This is a great game of balancing several resources against each other, with some fun dice-rolling thrown in.  The luck of the dice can be tempered with Tool use and commiting more workers, so it's not a luck-fest.  Lots of choices every step of the way, and lots of fun.

[Updated] Lowered the rating - I don't like that the game is cheating by trying to pretend it has multiple resources when they have the exact same conversion rates from dice to VP. The core of the game is: roll the dice, get some  resource of only one type then use it to buy VP.
I am still surprised how many people are suckers for a dice leather cup and a pretty board!
Linear (each turn is identical, there is no overall goal to the game), simplistic (all resources feel the same).

For me, a bit too light weight and the randomness of the dice (even with mitigation) does clash a bit with the fact that it is a strategic euro. But despite this, it still works. There is still enough interesting choices and replayability/strategic growth to keep me intrigued. It's fun, tense and I like the hut tiles and scoring cards. Stone Age has a great flow to it and ease of play, and really is a great 'gateway' euro. It gives a great intro into economic management, particularly with the risk taking aspect of worker upkeep and the dice (though this kind of sets Stone Age apart from more static euros) as well as coupling this with points gathering. The theme also works well with the gameplay. It's not hard to see why Stone Age is loved as much as it is.

I played this four times at the 2008 Gathering of Friends and purchased it the same week (which says something, since I purchase games very selectively these days). I found Stone Age to be quite engaging. I tend to rank games that really grab me a bit low with the intention of bumping up the rating if the title stands up to the test of time. I think Stone Age may merit being bumped up to a "9" rating and a spot in the ranks of elite games in my collection ... if the large swings in luck inherent in all dice games don't someday sour my in ititial, very favorable reaction. Note: After many, many plays of Stone Age, it hasn't lost any of its luster. Rating bumped up to 9, making this one of the elite games in my collection. Update ... now one of fewer than 20 games out of 900 I've rated that scores a 10. However, I've found some averaging dice (with the numbers 2-3-3-4-4-5) that I use with Stone Age to smooth out the luck, which can unbalance the game at times.

I gave it a 6 which is probably low but I think its because I just have played it sooooooo much that its kind of getting boring. Plus really, Champions of Midguard is a little more fun. Definitely a good game for beginners and people generally pick up how to play quickly, although it may take two plays to formulate a strategy and understand how you can win.  I have the expansion, but I just haven't played it enough to give an opinion yet. I might try just to see if it breathes new life into the game.

I hate games where dice control your resources. The game is actually a lot of fun outside of the rolling dice part. I just wish there was a better way to get resources. This isn't a problem in Settlers because of the trading component.

I understand why trading isn't implemented in this game as well, but still it's a bit frustrating that you're at the will of the dice gods.

I'm also pretty sure that civilization cards aren't properly balanced, but that could have had something to do with my opponents mostly ignoring them.

I've played this three times now and each time I enjoyed it.  The game length is about just right and I like the fact that I can explain the rules to someone in a manner of minutes.  I'm definitely seeing that the cards are the key to winning.  All in all, a very enjoyable game that I would recommend as a family game.  There is a luck factor (rolling dice for resources) that can have a significant impact on your success in this game so if you are a strategy purest, you won't like this game.  But for what it is, a fairly light, strategy, worker placement game, it fits the bill.

RATING: 7.5
Played twice 3-player and once 2-player, better with 3 players than 2 since food is not much of a factor in a 2-player game, allowing the players to focus on cards and buildings with little competition. This is a very fun game that is easy to grok (much easier than Pillars of the Earth) and the decisions don't take nearly as long as PotE. Definitely luck in the roll, but there is still some strategic depth to the game.

Cute game about developing a tribe of hunter/gatherers. Can feel repetitive after several plays. There isn't any real differentiation in resources, and penalties for starvation aren't scaled to the size of your tribe, so ignoring food is a viable strategy...

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
While I enjoyed Stone Age, I feel that it is another incarnation of the worker placement mechanism that is not sufficiently different than previous games (Pillars of the Earth, Cuba, and to some extent, Leonardo da Vinci).  It is a very handsome game, and I will say that I loved the inclusion of the dice, to bring a bit of flavor to the game.  However, in the end, I have seen this game several times before, and in my opinion, it has been done better.  Less complex than either Pillars or Cuba, and especially Caylus, and less rewarding.  Preferred to Leonardo da Vinci (which is itself a ripoff of Princes of Florence).

UPDATE:  Nearly a year after my first play, I acquired a copy of Stone Age in trade.  I knew it would get played quite a bit around here, and it serves as a good counter to Agricola, which can be a bit of a bear to set up and play.  

What I have since found is that, quite surprisingly, Stone Age is nearly the perfect game.  It is not actually perfect, it has flaws and downsides, but the light depth that it carries, coupled with a quick play/teach time is superb.  The dice impact the game minimally, but add to the gameplay immensely.  What do I mean?  

The problem that I have with a good deal of Euro games is that they are so scripted to give the players more control over the game that they tend to become a little (or a lot) stale and lifeless.  Even some of my favorite Euros do not conjure up images of fun and enjoyment, but more images of challenge and mechanical operations.  Stone Age proves that challenge, mechanical operations, fun, and enjoyment can be combined, if even on a slightly shallow level.  Yspahan included dice, and did a good job at making a good game where fun simmered, but did not leap off the board.  Kingsburg was entirely too "you do your thing, I'll do mine" for my tastes.  The way the dice are used in Stone Age is simple, yet can cause for some devilish moments. 

But the game is not all that shallow.  I am sure that there are ways to break the game, to figure it out--I don't care about those ways, and I don't want to know them.  What I do care about is that every single player can play the game from a drastically different angle, and yet still interaction is all over the place, especially in a 2P game.

Is it innovative?  Absolutely not.  Is it polished, yes and no.  Is it interactive?  Most of the time.  So why is it such a great game?  Because it seems like it gets it--the designer has crafted a game that politely steals from several recent games (namely Pillars of the Earth, Cuba, et al) and somehow manages to present a game that works quite well in spite of its similarities.    

One more minor thing stands out:  Stone Age allows players to take buildings/cards, even if they cannot pay for them.  The minor effect is that you can slow another player's game down, stalling them.  The mass effect is that this is a very slight way of making the game cutthroat.  More than that, though, is that if a player is able to stall another player from scoring points in this manner, at just the right time, it can be used to steal something from under another player.  Most Euros prohibit such actions--you are forbidden from taking something that you cannot pay for.  The result of this is that players can play with blinders on, causing a bit of interaction detraction.

RATING: 5
Yet another euro that I'm beginning to find dull, but, as with Carcassonne, the fault here seems to lie with my gaming group. They just can't seem to wrap their heads around the fact that hoarding resources is not going to win them the game, leading to 150+ point victories for me, and I'm hardly a gaming genius. I don't know whether I would start liking this game again if I had different people to play with, but that isn't going to happen so Stone Age keeps its low score from me.

A solid worker-placement Euro, plays quite fast with satisfying amount of decisions each turn. It uses dice, which turns some people off, but in-game tools of luck management (amount of meeples assigned and amount of hammers) makes a fun exercise in probability theory on the go.

Good for novices, although cards need some experience to be used effectively.

This game has grown on me a little as I play it more. The more I understand the game the more I realise there are multiple strategies to victory and there are difficult choices to be made all the time. The dice are not a really a big factor in the game – good dice rolls at the beginning of the game count as much as at the end, and there are ways to mitigate against bad rolls.

This is a very beautiful game, with solid mechanics that I want to enjoy a lot.  However, you just spend your turns gathering resources and trading them for points with no real feeling of progression as the game goes on. It's a long game, so I end up feeling bored by the end.

Also, the scoring at the end is based on multiplying different factors together.  I'm generally not a big fan of games where that happens, because the ending often feels so one-sided.

Lots of fun, it's a worker placement game with a little luck thrown in the mix.  I play this sometimes between bouts of agricola.   The only downside is the dice rolls allow a luck element.  There's still a decent amount of strategy involved, but if everyone's playing smart, it all comes down to luck.

A worker placement euro with a well intergrated theme. The object is to develop your tribe better than the rest of your opponents. The game allows for different strategies but not all of them are equally rewarding.

The game is amazingly appealing, the production quality has set an unmatched standard in attractiveness. At first I thought the game was uninspiring, but as I played more it grew on me somewhat, only to have it crash down again once I tried most of the strategies.

The main problem is that both the actions and the resources are unbalanced - the second because of the cards. Gathering any resource other than wood is a second class choice - by far. Actually the cheaper the resource, the better - by far. If that was different somehow, it would be a good game. 
Then they could balance the huts with the cards and make it a great game.. Oh well, poorly tested fail. (yes I know, how dare I?)

RATING: 5
Seemed like something I'd really like at first play.   In fact, the more I think on my experience playing (once) and watching (2-3 times) this game the less enamoured I am with it.  Basically, it doesn't fill any niche better than other games that I own or have access to.  For a Euro with dice, I prefer Kingsburg or Yspahan -- where your decisions about what to do with the dice are actually meaningful.  For a worker placement game, I prefer Agricola, Pillars of the Earth, Keythedral, or even Caylus Magna Carta.  For a family/gateway game, there are many that I prefer.  And to top it all off, the games that I have seen and played all seemed to run longer than desirable for a game of this weight.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A beautiful looking game which makes use of an old but good mechanic, that of worker placement. My only criticism would be that resources toward the end of the game become almost meaningless as you run out of spots to place your neandermeeples. The cards scoring system is almost identical to Oasis. The scoring track is almost useless as at least one player goes well over 100 points even in a four player game. Overall- I love it, even if the player interactivity is a tad on the low side (yet it is probably a high level for a Euro).

**UPDATE**

After a few plays this lost all appeal. It is a very simplistic worker placement game that relies too heavily on end game scoring.

I simply don't see any reason for this game to exist.  I understand that every designer wants to try his or her hand at the worker placement genre, and some manage to distinguish themselves sufficiently to make them worthwhile, but more often than not they simply end up paling in comparison to the original and greatest worker placement game - Caylus.  Just like Pillars of the Earth which came before it, Stone Age is another worker placement, resource collection, turn resources into victory points game that I can't see ever wanting to play when I could just as well be playing Caylus.  The added randomness of Stone Age is a downside in my mind, as is the scoring of the artifact cards (reminiscent of the aristocrats in St. Petersburg or markets in Hacienda).  I didn't like that scoring progression in those games and don't like it in Stone Age either.  I simply don't understand why games like this and Pillars of the Earth exist.

I have played it, again.  I really hate this game.  When playing it, I find myself thinking of all the other more interesting things I could be doing like watching paint dry or grass grow.

Seriously, this is a pretty darn good game called Caylus.  Then, someone seems to have taken that game and made a very poor game that was similar to it in some ways and called it Pillars of the Earth.  Then, someone seems to have taken PotE and made a crappy version of that game and we end up with Stone Age.

One play, 4p.  I had fun, but really hated the randomness of dice.  I felt bad for my hubby rolling two 1's with his two meeples on gold, while I rolled a 25 with five meeples on food.  In this game the number of pips you roll seems to directly correspond with points for any resource except food, so it seems easy to get screwed by the dice gods.  I would like to see this game with the rolling randomness removed - i.e. how about each meeple is worth 3?  Could be fun, could be boring.

Brilliant worker-placement game that just about has it all. The dice-rolling mechanic is at the heart of the game therefore the luck component is quite high.

With four players competition for resources can get very high.

I consider this to be a great 'gateway game' - it's fairly simple and relatively easy to explain, it plays quickly and there are several viable strategies. Though it's a bit more complicated than Settlers of Catan, in my opinion it's better because it's less punishing if you have a few bad turns in a row as you can't get permanently locked out of areas.

Good gateway game for worker placement games. Theme is nice, components are good quality and board is beautiful. There are also many balanced ways to win the game and rules are very elegant. However ultimately many moves become "scripted" after few plays and the game lacks depth to entertain 10+ games. I have not tried the expansion which could fix some problems with adding more buildings.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
love this game, and find it nearly perfect as a 2, 3, and 4 player.

(especially with expansion)

It's got that great mechanism of mitigating randomness, where you can play things fairly safe and stockpile some resources, or push a bit of luck when the payoff is worth the risk. Plus, it has a great balance between tactics (grab that while it's available!) and strategy (go for all tool-based bonuses and push for it no matter the cost). 

We find the expansion balances out all the strategies well, bringing a basic building strategy into contention (with low cost buildings and more builder bonus cards) plus allows for clever play using the trading track.

I honestly cannot find a fault with the game other than it's over-long with 5 players. The only reason not to play it repeatedly is that my other games will get jealous.

The only flaw in this game is it's expansion.  I wish they'd just added a 5th player and nothing else.  Other than that, the base game is definitely board gaming perfection.  You can strategically push people out of resources, yet if they're savvy enough, they can find a way to block you.  You will never run away with a game, unless your opponents let you.  You will always have to win by optimizing your resources better than your opponent.  Yet you do have some luck results with the die, but not to the point where you felt the die roll was the reason anyone won.  PERFECT GAME!!!

It's not too difficult to learn and there are many paths to victory and it's hard to tell which path everyone is taking, and I'm always hoping I'm not taking the same path as someone else as that can be a problem.  Making babies in the "love hut" is cool as is the "slap in the face to vegans" with the real leather dice cup.  It is a cave man game after all.  "Your strange ways frighten and confuse me".

We've played a lot of this, it works very well, I haven't yet figured out the winning strategy.  The dice seem to provoke a randomness, but the cards and choices can provide a strategy to victory. This will come out a lot more.

This definitely makes for a good gateway game and family game. With two people it's quick but there is usually a large gap between the number of points for each player (for us at least, maybe I am just bad at this game).
Buying huts feels a bit pointless - they only give you points, no special abilities. Definitely a lightweight game for a euro, with a bit of dice thrown in to make it a bit more random

If there were for example three full sets of 5 cards it might feel a bit more balanced, but basically for us whoever buys the most green cards wins

I am keen to try the expansion, which adds better tiles (e.g. the personal wood camp @1:2)

A great Worker Placement game with fantastic use of the dice rolling and set collection mechanics. There is no time playing Stone Age without lots of fun and strategy. Of course some people will say that the dice rolling is a strategy destruction, but in the real world we really have the randomness, like you discover a mine, but it has no gold.
The only problem for me is that the game can turn very long if the players want to maximize their points.

This is a solid game for family and friends who are not big gamers. It's got enough to interest people without overwhelming them. It really does seem like "Pillars light", but that doesn't have to be a bad thing.

RATING: 10
Players struggle to survive the Stone Age by working as hunters, collectors, farmers, and tool makers. As you gather resources and raise animals, you work to build the tools needed to build your civilization.
Players use up to 10 tribe members each in 3 phases. In the first phase, players place their men in regions of the board that they think will benefit them, including the hunt, the trading center, or the quarry. In the second phase, the starting player activates each of his staffed areas in whatever sequence he chooses, followed in turn by the other players. In the third phase, players must have enough food available to feed their populations, or they face losing resources or points.

Light enough for new gamers to get into while still having enough meat for more experienced gamers.
Dice randomness so it doesn't feel dry & samey but which can be controlled to a certain extent so they don't run the game.

The best gateway game.  

Once you are good at it, becomes a math exercise, which is interesting.  It then revolves around clever placement and a race to get the cards you need and stop your opponents from getting their cards.  Still worth playing here and there.  

This one shows newbies that games have decisions within your control.  How many workers you place shows how many dice you get.  Easily infuse the decisions with value.

After 1 play with 4 players - Enjoyed this game very much.  It dragged a little near the end but otherwise I thought it played well. I really like the dice rolling mechanic for resource gathering.  It appears after one play that there are various strategies that can be pursued.  Rating may go up if the time of play comes down next game.

EDIT2: Still one of the best. For me it's a 2008 game of the year.

A fun and accessible worker placement game.  The theme really shines and is fun to role play in this Euro-style game.  There is depth and strategy without the complexity that will limit appeal.

A hard one to get, but glad I splurged and picked this one up.

Similar game play feel to Ninjato. Ninjato is a bit more complicated, but I think the theme fits better with it. Besides, I really dislike the random element of the dice rolling with Stone Age. I've felt like both games I've played have been decided more by high or low rolls than actual strategy. So there is nothing to make me want to play this instead of Ninjato when it comes down to it...

Good game, quite similar to Pillars Of The Earth. Still not sure if it is worthwile to have both games in your collection. I do like the addition of dice and dice modifiers in this game, and after watching a player claim victory after some really bad die rolls, I am convinced that the amount of luck they introduce is not overbearing.
UPDATE: Played again after several years and really liked it. Components are great, the artwork is inviting and the rules are very accessible. It also scales quite well with 2 to 4 of players. It has more replayability and less randomness than POTE, so I generally like it better! If played with its expansion (the new huts and the talisman), the game is a solid 9 for me.

Mixed feeling about this game. I like it and enjoyed playing it even though it was with two and I can see how the game would be more tension-filled with a couple more players. However, two major quibbles...worker placement is fine, but each of those resources do not feel unique enough. Yeah, sure, for buying huts, it seems important, but after that, the different types of resources are quite useless. If you go just for resource card strategy, might as well take wood all the time. The second major boo boo for me is that some of those actions are WAY too important and powerful and seems to be taken first almost every turn. Also, unlike Agricola, food seems very easy to come by. Overall, the game still remains fun. I am not sure if this game will have longevity but it is a decent gateway game.

Nov 2010 update: Still a decent gateway game but it feels really repetitive after a while. It also seems to drag quite a bit. Can have runaway issues midway when your resouce engine is up and going.

I seem to like the lighter side of the worker placement games.  Games like Caylus and Agricola wear out their welcome for me.  There is just too much to decide between.  I prefer the games with a move fixed set of decisions, like Pillars of the Earth and now Stone Age.  Several people have said that they like this better than Pillars.  Their main objection to Pillars has been with the luck of the worker placement draw.  The luck in this game is better controlled, but Pillars has more flavor.  Since I don't really object to the luck in Pillars, I still give it the edge.

A dice-rolling game that places heavy emphasis upon order of worker placement.  While this makes for a heavy strategy element, there is high randomness in the game meaning if unlucky it is patently impossible to win.  One's enjoyment of the game will solely come down to if you roll well and receive the cards you need.

Wasn't bad, but it does seem a little chaotic (i.e., the person who rolls the dice best wins vs. strategic). Not that rolling dice is bad-- but it did seem that any option you choose to do with your resources is good, so it ended up more who had more resources, which is based on the luck of the dice as much as population expansion/food production/etc...

Worker Placement, multiple paths to victory... but tends to push everyone towards a similar score, assuming you realize the value of the cards.  Biggest oddity is that, mathematically speaking, everyone that grows their family at all should intentionally starve it (-10 points a turn) for the majority of the game,  because the pip-cost of points retained by expending food exceeds the pip-cost of points that could be gained elsewhere.  not a "flaw",  but the game will be almost exclusively won by those who try to starve their families, and that's probably not the intent.

Gameplay is quite fun.  I wish there was something more fun to do with the resources you gathered rather than just converting them into straight points.  Games play out very similarly because of this.  Most players are similarly equipped and going for similar goals.

RATING: 6.5
Pros: classic gateway game with worker placement mechanic integrated with dice rolling, great theme, good art

Cons: no direct player interaction, limited winning strategies, lengthy playtime for what it is, relatively non-thematic, arbitrary victory point system

While I love the theme, there are just too many little quirks about this game that I dislike. I personally desire more strategic options than simply choosing between going after the civilization cards or building. I don't mind similar dichotomies of strategies in other games, but there is something quite bland or anti-thematic about it in this. There is just too much of a disconnect between theme and game mechanics in this one for me, I guess. And I wish the game wouldn't let you feed your workers with resources when out of food. Other than that, the game works great--each decision you make is meaningful, and the effect of the dice is handled in a thematic way. I simply wanted more from this one.

This one is right up my alley.  Good resource management, with a little luck of the dice throw in.  The limited number of workers in each field allow for a fair amount of screwage while leaving enough viable alternative options available.  Easy to teach and fun to play.

Alright civilization builder with some luck and probability management thrown in.  My main complaint is that it seems to reward players willing to memorize the cards opponents take or to have some system to keep track of how important each objective is to the other players.

I've played this game A TON. Mostly because it has a really great iOS app. Stone Age is a worker placement game where you are cavemen (or something like that) trying to grow your family, build houses, and learn new technologies. There are definitely a lot of ways to victory which is nice. The game also seems really balanced overall (no major issues with Kingbuilding, analysis paralysis, player elimination). However, I am getting to the point that I've played this game so much, I know way too much to play it with most people. This isn't a bad thing. The fact that I've played this game a ton just shows how great it is. But you can't play any game endlessly and have it still remain the same level of fun. Therefore I'm only giving it a 7.5 for me right now.

A very uncomfortable first play - the dice hated me - though subsequent plays were better.  It did get me thinking of why I much prefer Kingsburg, and I think it's because in that game, you roll the dice and then decide how best to use them - with poorer rolls bringing first choice - whereas in Stone Age you decide what you would like to do, which can then be denied.  One is opportunity, the other is frustration.

Just a note, I mostly have played this on the iOS app, and on BGA.com.  Only a few times in person.

I like this game, but not as much as most seem to, and I don't see it as such a great gateway game as most believe it to be.

Stone Age feels a little too fiddly with the constantly moving workers around, replacing buildings and boats, and rolling dice on top of it.  I find it cumbersome to teach with all of the multiplication rules.  And after several plays, it feels like you've mostly mastered it, and the game is playing you as you just go through the motions.  Most moves are decided for you based on turn order.

1st update (Jan 2011)[9]: It's fast, little downtime, but many meaningful choices (at least to an untrained newbie). Faster and more interaction than Agricola, easier to teach.
Downside: As someone who hates random luck in games, the dice may be bad. But you KNOW they are there so you calculate that you might not get what you want, which is good. Perhabs over-powered Civ card (+4 tools), but more plays will tell that.

2nd update (Dec 2013)[8]: I kind of burned out a little bit on this game, though I still believe it is a fantastic game. I haven't played the physical version for several years though, so I ended up selling it.

I was so disappointed by this game.  I had very high expectations and there is a very good game in there somewhere but man does it stay way past its welcome.  It has some of the mechanisms of Pillars but don't let that fool you, it is fundamentally a set collection game with dice rolling aspects.  So much of this game depends on what's available when you're the start player.  I truly don't enjoy games which are so heavily weighted to this kind of luck.  In addition to that very significant short fall the game we played went on for well over the 60 minutes it should take which in and of itself maybe too long.  It didn't seem like we were playing terribly slowly which makes me question where that 60 minutes estimate comes from.  I might play this again but unless it plays significantly faster I probably won't give it a third try.

Fits great into the same niche that [gameid=22345] fits into, which is the miniature Euro that takes about an hour, has satisfying decisions, and has enough of a sprinkling of luck that it won't always be hardcore gamers who win.  The art and components are wonderful, if sometimes a hair too cartoonish.  Also, it's pretty much awesome that you have to send two of your dudes together to the hut to make another.  Kick out the kids and pull the fur curtain, baby, because now I'm going to take you to paradise!

My wife and I really enjoy it as a 2 player game. There are a lot of different paths to victory, which is something I really appreciate in a game.  Playing with 4 didn't improve the game much for me, but it's still very good.  A 4 player game can drag out a bit too far for what it is.

Just a fun game, where everything fits together perfectly. Easy to learn and play, nice decisions but not brain-burning, some luck to provide differentiation, but not too much.

I like playing the occasional dice game, and this fits the bill nicely. A nice tweaking method with the tools to make sure you can influence the dice to reduce the luck factor. Lots of tough decisions as to which spot to choose when it's your turn.

From 2009: Very beautiful and lavish production but I still think it goes on about 20-30 minutes longer than it should. This is probably why I will not buy this game. I can see it being very popular with the lighter gaming crowd. A very nice way to involve dice and resource management.

(After 1 4p game)  Was looking forward to playing this one for a while.  It is very pretty to look at and rather easy rules explanation.  I enjoy the worker placement mechanism and SA has it.  Initial game went a little long and hope game time decreases on future plays.  I can see the complaints about repetitiveness, BUT I think repeated plays might break that up a bit.  The dice rolls do add a bit of randomness and "luck", but it goes both ways - the bountiful harvest or coming up short with not enough tools to change things.  Want to play again.

Dopo averci giocato 10 volte posso dire che è un buon punto di partenza per imparare un gestionale basato sul piazzamento lavoratori ma non è da comprare, giocateci online, da amici e poi vi spostate sul passo successivo che a mio avviso è rappresentato da Village. una volta imparato Village il passo successivo è Dungeon Lords. La tematica in Stone Age è triste e poco interessante (come tutti i gestionali) migliora in Village e in Dungeon Lords è l'apoteosi :) Giochi simili + complesis per esperti sono Tzolkin per esempio o i 10mila che escono ogni anno da Yunnan a non so che altri. Mio preferito? Dungeon Lords. :)

Simple rules and trusted mechanichs (worker placement, some dice rolling, a bit of resource management) with a good dose of randomness.
Some locations (and cards) seem definitely better than others.
Beautiful artwork.

My go-to 2nd tier gateway game (after TtR, SoC, etc) and my favorite introduction to the worker placement mechanism. Also just a great game. Easy to learn but fairly deep on strategy and very well balanced. I've played a fair number of untracked games on BGA as well.

Edit 9/21/16 - this one has gotten a bit stale for me. I'm more willing to jump up to a slightly more complex game these days. I haven't gotten my hands on Family Agricola yet but I'm guessing that might replace this one for me.

Nice worker placement game with lots of dice. Nothing extra-ordinary here, at least on the first glance.

Update after second game: I didn't remember all the things at the start, but managed to get a good start (as usual in these kinds of games) only to see others bypassing in the end (as usual).

Anyway, the game looks good and there are not that many dice after all. Lots of things to do and balance, but somehow the game just does not hit me.

first play - 4 players - This was a ton of fun. I loved all the choices you had each round. The dice rolling and cards that came up added a welcome dose of randomness to the game. I came in second becasue I put too much stock into the tools early on when I should have been concentrating on making more meeples and farms. I was one artifact short of the full set which still would have had me in second but only by a slim margin. I'm looking forward to my next play of this one.

Update: My husband has now 'broken' the game. He can calculate the dice probabilities/victory point outcomes for every meeple placement decision in the game... in his head in real time. The game has degraded into a competitive 'spreadsheet solve'. I either mathematically calculate optimum meeple placement each turn... or lose... We're going to trade it and buy something he can't break.

Update: Downrated to 5 after additional plays. 

Update: Downgraded again. We now own genuinely good light games...

Very disappointed with Stone Age. The pieces are lovely, but
the scoring system feels opaque so you have no idea who is winning until the end. The theme has no connection to the game and strategy seems to involve mathematical calculations of which cards to pick. 

It's definitely harder to teach than Agricola because of the obscure win conditions. With Agricola, you need to find out HOW to build a better farm. Stone Age is more abstract.

It feels less intuitive than Agricola family rules, significantly less thematic and much less fun to play. No idea why it's seen as a 'gateway' to Agricola.

 The one new mechanic here is the dice rolling to get resources: you roll one die for every worker you placed in that particular resource region and then divide the total number of pips rolled by the divisor for that resource (for better resources the divisor is higher), and that's how many of the resource you get. This is clever, but everything else about the game is painfully straightforward. The scoring mechanisms are so plain- during the game you literally convert the value of the resources you've obtained to VP at a 1-1 rate; and the end-game scoring consists of having done some set-collecting via card drafting.. yawn. In short, a perfectly functional game I won't object to but will never request. I think the enjoyment here as much as anything else is the excitement of hoping for a good roll of the dice.

# Non-essayé : 2

►COMMENTAIRE(S) ABRÉGÉ(S):
± THÈME : plutôt plaqué; mais agrémente le jeu.
+ Configurations équilibrées selon le nombre de joueurs.
- Déroulement scripté : peut favoriser l’adoption de "scénarios répétitifs" d’une partie à l’autre.
+ Icônes : sont faciles à comprendre ou à mémoriser.

►REMARQUE(S) PERSONNELLE(S):
Jeu où chaque joueur incarne un chef d’une tribu préhistorique qui envoit les membres de sa famille aux différents lieux (à l’intérieur et à l’extérieur du village) pour se procurer de la nourriture ou récupérer des ressources en vue de construire des huttes et développer leur civilisation.

Un des premiers jeux de placement d’ouvriers que je montrerais à des joueurs n’ayant jamais essayé un jeu de ce genre à cause de certaines de ses cases d’actions permettant d’accueillir des ouvriers de plusieurs joueurs ce qui le rend plus abordable pour les nouveaux joueurs (moins restrictifs que les habituels jeux de placement d’ouvriers où 1 case d’action ne peut être occupée que par 1 seul joueur). Cependant, il ne faut pas se laisser berner par cet aspect "gentil" car les parties peuvent aussi être plus "méchantes" selon les stratégies employées.

Stratégiquement parlant, les joueurs qui connaissent celles-ci seront avantagés par rapport aux autres :
1e- Les actions suivantes sont à privilégier : Reproduction, Agriculture, Cartes « Civilisation ». 
2e- Les cartes « Civilisation » étant achetables avec 1 à 4 ressource(s) de n’importe quelle sorte, la récupération de bois devient donc l’action de choix pour se les procurer à moindre effort.
3e- La fin de partie étant déclenchée après la fin d’1 des piles « Hutte » ou à moins de 4 cartes « Civilisation » restantes sur le plateau, un joueur pourrait retarder le déclenchement de la fin de partie en plaçant 1 de ses ouvriers sur celles-ci et en les laissant en place par la suite afin de provoquer un tour de jeu supplémentaire (un joueur s’étant placé sur une tuile « Hutte » ou une carte « Civilisation » n’est jamais obligé de la récupérer même s’il possède les ressources nécessaires).
4e- Une stratégie de blocage peut aussi s’appliquer sur les lieux de ressources afin d’empêcher un adversaire de se procurer des ressources convoitées (dans cette situation, le joueur-bloqueur récupérera des ressources mais cela n’a aucune influence sur la fin de partie puisque les ressources sont considérées illimitées).

À noter que certains commentaires reprochent au jeu que le score en cours de partie n’est jamais représentatif du score final à cause du décompte des cartes « Civilisation » révélées en fin de partie qui vient tout chambouler. Personnellement, cet aspect du jeu ne m'a jamais dérangé mais je laisse à chacun le soin de décider si cela lui convient ou non. Cependant, j’ai remarqué que lorsque des nouveaux joueurs affrontent des habitués, les nouveaux joueurs restent motivés tout au long de la partie puisqu'ils n’ont pas sous les yeux les hauts pointages des habitués pour leur rappeler qu’ils sont moins performants.

►JEU(X) COMPARABLE(S) ESSAYÉ(S):
Bien que j’ai aussi joué à d’autres jeux utilisant une mécanique de placement d’ouvriers, aucun d’entre eux ne me semble assez comparable pour l’instant puisqu’ils sont plus complexes et/ou restrictifs (ex : Agricola, Caylus, Village).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
As you start setting the game up, you may ask yourself, "Is this Pillars?", namely because the way you put out the resources, and the way you place your workers to take them, are pretty similar.  The differences really end there, since at that point the dice add a different random element that, really, is a little more palatable than drawing pawns out of a bag.  At least you have some control over your odds, with being able to place a number of peeps to correspond to the number of dice you roll.  There are fewer options to choose from in this variation of the game, but there seems to be something less dry about the end result.  Go figure.  It helps that there are more than one way to get VPs in the game, though, meaning you can try different strategies each time you play, whereas with Pillars, you have to pretty much use your craftsmen to earn VPs.

The 2-player game is pretty good, too.  Some of the actions become unavailable after a certain point, and only one player can place to a particular resource site, so there's a lot of potential for screwage.  There's definitely more of a chance that someone will pick a building, but not be able to build it.  There are so many different ways to score points, and they seem to be balanced so that the game is always close.

Dependence on dice for resources makes it too luck based and may turn off euro fans.Feels more luck based than a truly strategic game.

Edit: re-played this a couple more times on Board Game Arena and downgrading it. The amount of chaos introduced by relying on dice makes it a truly horrible experience when you roll badly two or three times in a row. Will be playing catch up for the rest of the game and usually end up just waiting for the game to end knowing you will lose anyway.

For a better experience I would advise Tzolkin, the Mayan calendar.

Players struggle to survive the Stone Age by working as hunters, collectors, farmers, and tool makers. As you gather resources and raise animals, you work to build the tools needed to build your civilization.
\13\\13\
Players use up to 10 tribe members each in 3 phases. In the first phase, players place their men in regions of the board that they think will benefit them, including the hunt, the trading center, or the quarry. In the second phase, the starting player activates each of his staffed areas in whatever sequence he chooses, followed in turn by the other players. In the third phase, players must have enough food available to feed their populations, or they face losing resources or points.

I knew Stone Age was a lighter worker placement game, but it was a lot easier to play than I anticipated.  We played a 2P game, and I was a little surprised that neither of us ever seemed to feel strapped for food or resources.  There always seemed to be plenty of opportunities for both, so it didn't feel like there was much tension for fighting over spots to place people.  As a result, gameplay felt a lot more casual and easy-going.  For all of these reasons, I think this would make a great gateway game.

UPDATE:  Played this 3P and 4P and there was a bit more contention for resources.  A great time at any player count!

I don't love this one. It's sort of a kinder, gentler worker placement game. There isn't a tremendous amount of blocking that can be done and it seems like there are a million ways to score points.

Count me among those who freaked out when I saw that many dice. However, the system of adding pips rather than taking each die at its value goes a long way toward mitigating the screwage factor, and adds an interesting twist to the worker placement mechanic by not guaranteeing you'll end up with something for each person you place. I like that there doesn't seem to be a single dominant strategy. It does run a little bit longer than I'd like (it can take as long as a game of Agricola, and I think that one is a little deeper), but it's certainly not boring.

A light, fun game with a nice mixture of planning and luck.  This looks like it may become my default worker placement game, as it's more accessible to those who get overwhelmed by Agricola.

One of the family's favorite games. The setting is great and the children really get into it. There are so many ways to win - the family usually gangs up on me in games like that but no matter what they try to block - there is always another possibility to achieve more points and I have never lost this game ;)
The game actually gets better the more often you play it, so I had to upgrade it from 9->10

RATING: 6
A very conflicted rating, at the moment.  I had a lot of fun playing this game, but the post-game (mathy) analysis turned up a lot of oddities, like the utter domination of agriculture over baby-making.  Coming to BGG, we discovered the imbalance was even greater than we figured.  Unbalanced actions aren't inherently a problem, of course, and often add interesting trade-offs and decisions, but agriculture seems so wildly over-powered that it's a bit suspicious.  Very anxious to see how this plays now that we're all a bit wiser.  If it's still fun, the rating will definitely go up.

RATING: 7
Yes, it can be luck-driven, but this randomness goes hand in hand with excitement. There's just enough depth and strategy in this game to satisfy both beginners and advanced players. And it looks gorgeous! 

The downside is that the resolution of actions may take a while and it's hard to estimate who is actually winning - there's a ton of points to be scored from cards at the end of the game. You might feel that you are doing ok throughout the game only to be crushed during final scoring. 

Nevertheless, this is probably the ultimate gateway to the world of worker placement games. Highly recommmended! It's not a strategic masterpiece, but if you treat it as a light, fun euro (which it is) you'll have a great time with it.

RATING: 7
Kind of a civilization/resource-management game. Multiple possible strategies to win, allthough creating a lot of workers seemed to be best and other strategies were more based on blocking others from doing things, or you could win by pure luck. The amount of resources you got from your workers are determined by the dice. It has a nice fluid game system and seems to be an excellent gateway game for worker placement style games ..

RATING: 8
Pretty board,  nifty dice cup.  Very good worker placement to convert resources into VP game.   Playing ran a little long though - a bit of downtime since it's player at a time after the worker placement,  and there's a bit of light math with the addition/division.  Seems like there's resilience to both group-think and strategies - I played two games collecting the technology cards and got to over 200 points,  whereas a game where people pushed hard at building huts scored barely over 100 points.I'm impressed that the randomness stares you in the face - look at all those dice! - but there's just enough control to feel that you can earn your victory regardless - it feels like a strategic game!  Maybe because there's randomness everywhere and fluid valuation changes all the time,  it really feels like long term strategies combined with tactical optimization.  Rating has increased.Update: Seems to be holding up well to analysis...and I'm doing a lot of thinking on this one.  Lots of 3 and 4er games on BSW,  definitely plays well with those numbers.  Curious as to how 2er plays...Already wishing for a 5-6 player expansion...the only niggle about this game is that round to round things are pretty much the same.  Maybe some really big things to shoot for on an expansion board...although given that the box is already overflowing,  not sure where the expansion would go... (Maybe it could come with a bonus replacement insert!)

Dinged it half a point for length due to repetitive nature.  Otherwise,  excellent!

The definitive "how to worker placement" game. 

It has dice which mitigates experienced players ability to edge out and alienate new players. It has resource gathering and card/set collecting which translates well into many other games.

This is the ultimate light to medium weight gateway game. 

Plus the theme is neat and it looks good laid out on the table.

The first game that BSW did justice to. I still have a hard time playing without making the Ooga noise when placing my workers.

Addendum: rating lowered. The game likely drags on forever without changing, allturns are the same, just more workers. there s no actual developement (more tools? i dont consider it enough for a  developement).
it's a pity because the game itself would be enjoyable. i suggest to use a lower number of huts and cards to get to the end sooner

Worker placement game; grow your tribe, plant crops food a steady food supply, craft tools to help your workers, gather resources, build huts and recruit specialists (for points at the end of the game).

I don't like that there is almost no progression in the game - the buildings come out randomly and the only change over the course of the game is the number of workers you have and the number of tools. These do impact your ability to do things, but they feel very incremental so the actual actions are a little too repetitive. Add to that the fact that values are not obfuscated or variable enough in the building set collection - there is variation in the action cards and their symbols which plays a big part in the end game scoring, but the collection of resources to build buildings is just not a particularly satisfying loop. Lovely bits and presentation and a light atmosphere make this a mildly fun experience that I can be in the mood for and will be happy to play if someone suggests it.

RATING: 8.6
One of my favourites. Each game is so different and there are so many ways to victory. The dice rolling for resources is great fun and there's this constant feeling of uncertainty when placing your workers down, altough you can easily mitigate the bad rolls with the Tools that you can get throughout the game. 

Usually I try to go for max workers & max food levels and try to get the corresponding cards that give me x times the points for my worker/food levels but some games it's wiser to concentrate on something else.

So straightforward, and yet so fun! I was introduced to this game as using the same mechanics as Agricola, which is true to a degree. However, it's a different kind of fun to play. Stone Age felt more forgiving, and seemed to encourage wackiness, which is nice when most of the medium to heavy games are pretty dry. Agricola, on the other hand, put me on the edge of my seat, like, "Will I be able to feed my family or not?" I actually liked Agricola better (with all of one play on each...), but Stone Age does everything right in my book, and would, I think, make a pretty solid introductory game before introducing newbies to Agricola.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Our first 'worker placement'...we found Stone Age to be fantastic as an introduction into the genre.

After a few plays, and other more involved gaming, Stone Age has lost it's initial luster. It is a terrific game in the vein of Ticket to Ride and other gateway games. But unlike Ticket to Ride, there is little to warrent playing this game except when sitting down with new gamers.

It is not a bad game, and it has an appeal. There are simply more worker placement games now that have more depth. Still, we keep this game because it does appeal to new gamers and helps to keep a flow of immigrants to the board gaming hobby.

Fantastic components and an absolutely beautiful game board.  As you're playing, you are gazing upon artwork--no doubt.  Leather cup adds to theme and is one of my favorite elements of the game.  

Gameplay itself falls a bit flat for me.  I think it's because every turn feels the same.  Roll dice, gather resources or enlarge your family, grab a card or two.  Tension never seems to build. 

I like tension in games, believing it's the lifeblood of gameplay.  The only tension I feel in Stone Age is hoping for particular cards, though even then--not much.  

  
As far as worker placement games go, it seems to be the slickest, most streamlined version of that genre.  Place workers, get benefits, collect your workers.  There is no narrative.  You don't feel as if you are building toward anything.  It is a very pretty victory point machine.  That's it.

For me, though I don't dislike it, it fails to draw.  :(

After one play, I like this one a lot.  It's a light-weight Agricola, sort of.  So it's a little quicker to play, and has a similar but simpler worker placement mechanic.

RATING: 9
A beautiful yet functional board, nice components, dice, and an engaging theme have pushed this game to the top of my favourites.  Every time I play this game I try a slightly different strategy, and no single strategy seems dominant yet.  Maybe I will feed my people food, maybe wood (hehe).  Maybe I will grow my tribe to a massive size, maybe not grow at all.  Tools, fields, cards, huts... so many different paths to take and all equally viable.  I love it. 

Update: After 30+ plays I have begun to tire of this gem but still can't find any faults in it.  Excellent game that has what I like in a euro: some luck, variable strategies, and baby making ;)

My go-to game to teach new players on this type of game! (worker placement)
Nice and light but not too light everyone Ive played this with loved it!

My Favorite Aspect for this game is the Split between in game scoring with the buildings and the end game scoring with the civ cards, I Really like how you have to balance the two to really pull ahead. Ive been in games where players went all Buildings and lost, and games where someone went all civ cards and lost.

Liked it more than I thought I would. Cards and tiles take a bit of explaining but the rules are easy enough otherwise.

After playing many many games it would be very bad to come back and re-play Stone age. It gets very boring and time consuming. Better play it as an introductory to boardgames and then leave it in your shelf. I played it once again after many years and immediately offered it as a gift to my little co-player.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's fun. It's easy. It has tactics. There's dice in it - but they can be controlled.

However, the cards and especially the huts make this much too luck-dependant, especially in the 2-player game. I'll play it, because it's easy enough to play with my girlfriend. But game-wise, there's better to be had.

Farm whenever possible early, then opt for wood and tools. Later buy more cards on your opponent's turn and hope you flop the broken-est cards when you have first dibs. Both players should do exactly this, in addition to rolling high and not thinking about how they could more or less flip a coin instead.

I am just not too thrilled with this game.  Getting tons of hype, but the games seem to suddenly end - you don't seem to be working toward a goal as much as snagging whatever you can to score points. The game also seems to suffer from a "formula" route with people coming in with pre-disposed strategies rather than being forced to alternate given what the board gives them. I think a decent expansion could make this a really great game if it incorporated better interaction, goals being built up along a timeframe, etc.

I often find myself thinking about this game and wanting it to hit the table again.  I had [GameID=24480] (loved the book, had to have the game) but was turned off by the length. This seems to have similar mechanics, though not as deep.

The rules are not to complex for the level of gameplay available.  The luck is enough to keep my wife interested, but manageable.  While you might lose with really bad rolls, managing the rolls is part of what makes the game fun.

Despite those 'evil' dice being in the picture, I felt like there was still quite a bit of control left in the game. I do wonder about whether or not there are a few set opening strategies (get food. increase production. make tools. rinse. lather. repeat.)

Update: Increased my rating by a half-point after another play. This game is a breeze to teach newspielers. The only tricky bit is the civ card scoring - which isn't as obvious in the beginning parts of the game. Great fun! And despite the semi-programmed nature of the opening turns - it becomes very 
dynamic very soon after.

A great introductory worker placement game. The dice rolling gives an element of chance but seems thematic (you may not find gold or stone etc everytime you go looking for it).

Excellent game, with an interesting mechanic and a satisfying playing time overall. 90 - 120 minute game, where each player selects over some options what to do and this is really great.

I'm not sure if I was completely uninterested in this before even playing it because of the theme which is as common as sliced bread or because the group I was playing with was as flat as the Great Plains. Mechanically, this is, without a doubt, a very strong game but the flavor is lacking.

There are plenty of worker placement games that revolve around the concerns of Caucasians before the modern age. Caverna, Agricola, Castles of Burgundy, and Puerto Rico are all thematically similar. Mechanically they may be very different, but the theme does very little to separate them. There is little to none in the way of player interaction, and it ends up just being an optimization 

This would probably be rated higher if I wasn't into LCGs (Legend of the Five Rings) and looking for more thematic and interactive games. Mechanically, its a very solid game and for anyone that is a fan of Euros, I imagine it would be extremely fun. People looking for thematics and player interaction are probably going to pass.

Resource management and worker placement where the more workers you place the higher your odds of getting the goods (or on good rolls, the more goods you get) provided someone else hasn't beaten you to the resources you want.  A very good medium-light strategy game.

My wife suprised me with this for my 30th birthday (wry irony?) and it has been a lot of fun. It can be tense with the unknown score cards, but it certainly lets everyone feel they are doing well.  Best played with 4 but scales alright down to other numbers.

It may be unfair for me to say this, but I keep wanting to call Stone Age a dumbed down version of Pillars.  The game felt very mechanical.  Your first couple of choices every turn will always be the same, with the exception of when the end condition has been reached.  It is obviously pointless to waste a worker on any of the resource space if you can claim a tool that will improve your subsequent rolls as well as giving you VP opportunities.  The same with the spot to improve your agriculture track.  There is zero subtlety here and I hate the constant dice rolling as well as the amount of pointless arithmetic involved.  I can see this being a decent choice for a family game night, but as for me, once is plenty enough.

RATING: 9
If you are looking for an introductory game to the worker placement mechanic, Stone age is a great choice. There's enough interesting tactical choices that makes this game enjoyable. I'm a fan of the dice rolling in this game - makes it more exciting and stops the gameplay from being deterministic . It adds a fun element of risk management - Do I put two meeples on bricks and risk not getting enough this turn or three to be safe? Bad luck might ruin your plans for one turn, but there are ways of mitigating bad rolls and the luck factor is much less compared to a game like Catan (where a player can have no chance of winning just because of the dice variance) The components and art is gorgeous in this game too! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Interesting choices to make, although some can almost be made on autopilot each turn.  If the dice are constantly cruel to you, there's not much you can do about it, which is something I prefer to see mitigated in interesting ways in dice games.  No, alas, Stone Age pretty specifically and exclusively rewards high rolls at every moment.  That said, the choices make this about the closest thing you could have to a dice-driven Pillars of the Earth with a dash of Agricola and La Città (must... feed... growing... populace).

Love the components!  I prefer this with 3 or less players at the moment.  Mostly this is because the game group is still picking it up, so there is a little too much down time.

Buy either Stone Age or Lords of Waterdeep. More research needed. Might wait for a better basic worker placement game. Got Agricola.

Gyönyörű, mint egy festmény, és a játékmenet is rendben van. Egy hibája akadt, négyen próbáltuk, így pedig túl hosszú a játékidő. Két fővel ez állítólag a fele, vagyis kb. 60 perc, az már nekem azért jobban hangzik. Rajta a listán, feleséggel vmikor leszervezek egy próbát.

Very basic and very satisfying worker placement-card collector with thought out theme but that has some scaling problems - it works in 2 and 3 but should be played in 4. Shows its age, but still kicks a lot of newcomers in the butt.

After 10+ Plays: A good worker placement game when you don't want something as heavy as Agricola or Caylus, and this game is far superior to Pillars of the Earth and Leonardo da Vinci.

After 20+ Plays: I keep requesting this game it it never fails to deliver.  The use of dice is particularly well done in Stone Age.  There are plenty of rolls to even each player's results out over the course of the game, but in the short term players must consider the possibility of low results on individual rolls.

After 30+ Plays: Lowering rating from 9 to 8.  I think I've seen what this game has to offer by now.  It's still fun to play in a comfort food type of way, but after 30 plays I've seen all the game's tricks.

This is a fun worker placement game. the amount of hidden information is a bit off-putting as, unlike in Agricola, you're never sure how you're doing against your opponents unless you pay really close attention. The effort required to mentally tally all those variables for your opponents isn't worth the effort.

Not a big fun of worker placement games but I kinda like this one a lot. As for the randomness I feel like you roll so many dice that by the end of the game you dont even remember the times you got bad or good results. The guy with the best strategy and the best descisions seems to always win at the end.

My wife and I really enjoy playing this relaxing worker placement game. It's a little like sitting down to read a book together since we're making up a little story of what's happening in our world as we play the game. We usually have a good laugh and the score at the end isn't really a big deal.

One of the most played games this year. Very well designed worker-placement game. Can be teached very fast and leaves (at least when we played) no question open during play. I also like the dice rolling - it adds some randomness which I prefer to a completely dry game. Oh, also the theme as well as the overall graphic style (especially the board) are great.

Great game, beautiful artwork& components and the warm fuzzy we're-building-feeling. Recommended to play this one with those friends who find Puerto Rico and Catan a challenge - rulewise; this is a great light game. Since we keep on playing this, score corrected to max.

RATING: 8.5
The worker placement game with which to introduce anyone to worker placement games. A few actions that are seen as 'the correct place to go' and dice rolls dictating the volume of resources generated hurt it a little, but it really is best in class as a gateway game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Possibly the best (as in, fun) worker placement game I've played to date. Easy enough that we were able to almost play along as we were reading the rules, yet has enough strategic and tactical depth to satisfy all but the most hardcore gamers.

The 2-player rules adaptation turned out to be very good and, while it did change a bit the way the game was played, kept it very enjoyable and balanced.

Would heartily recommend to anyone, especially for family nights boardgaming.

While I'd rather play Agricola, Le Havre or Caylus as far as strategic games are concerned, the fact that this one is faster to play and doesn't cause me AP and brain bubbles from thinking too much is a big plus.

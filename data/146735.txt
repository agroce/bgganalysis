Munchkin, but with a super-awesome Mathematical Adventure Time! theme! There are a few changes and rule tweaks, but it still takes about the same amount of time to play. Rad for anyone that enjoys the show!

I chose this over the Munchkin Card Game or the Munchkin versions of games like Monopoly, basically because I like Adventure Time and just wanted some sort of gaming in that world. Love the over sized character cards in this one, and the cards' effects seem fairly thematic. In fact, the rules feel a little better and this is the most impressive Munchkin set yet...

RATING: 4
Bought this game in a fit of Adventure Time fandom, despite having never been interested in the Munchkin games at all. After playing it a couple of times, I can state with certainty that Munchkin is not a good game, and clumsily pasting the Adventure Time theme onto it does not make it better. In fact, the gameplay feels inextricably linked to the silly D&D parody of original-flavour Munchkin; applying it to something else (even something like Adventure Time, which takes a little inspiration from D&D) doesn't feel right. The custom Jake die is all kinds of cool, but there was no reason for me to keep this one.

The usual Munchkin formula puts the licensing to good use in this version, with effects and text that will appeal to fans of the show.  All in all, it's still Munchkin's formula of make everybody mad at each other through bribery, negotiation, and betrayal.  The backpack feels a bit OP however..

Hilarious. Not too familiar with winning strategically with this one, but I enjoy just playing (and losing). I do have an affection for Adventure Time.

Dropped to a 6 as this game is too swingy. Particularly once the psychic tandem war elephant comes into play. That card garuntees a win unless it's only acquired near the end.

Munchkin is a decent game by itself with a few balance issues like pile on the leader. Adventure Time just makes the game so much more fun to me. It also adds little sidekicks or companions that you can add to the game which is great. This property's theme and mythos fits so well for this style of game too. Great marriage of two ideas. I'd much rather play this version of Munchkin over regular Munchkin any day.

RATING: 6.13
[b]tl;dr[/b] — A good version of the game for hardcore fans of the show, but otherwise impenetrable.  If you have doubts about either it ain't for you.

Now, if you're [i]me[/i], you'd rate this game something mathematical like GOOGOLHEXAPETILLION!!! but that's only because the acid flashbacks finally allow you to understand the language of donuts [size=7][1][/size], pick up your sword [size=7][2][/size], wade into the dungeon [size=7][3][/size] and collect pelts [size=7][4][/size] as the wailing guitars shred space and time.

[size=7]1. They [i]were[/i] merely telepathic, but now they [i]speak[/i].

2. Knockoff AK with drum magazine.

3. Shopping mall.

4. "Pelts".

5. "Girl from Impanema" Muzak.[/size]
 
If you're [i]not[/i] me, then I dunno.  It's slightly better than vanilla [i]Munchkin[/i], being generally more creative and playful*, and the move toward iconography is nice.  That should put it at a 7.62 or something, but the [i]Adventure Time[/i] theme is pretty narrow, so it loses 1.49 points for that.**  Math!

[size=7]*We enjoyed the way some of the cards produce effects based on your current physical environment.

**Meaning, for best results you can really only play it with rabid fans of the show as anyone else will simply be perplexed.  (Unless they're into toad-licking and goats with tires around their tummies, in which case it's Game On, Duchamp!)[/size]

When I first played Munchkin, it was a horrible experience with the host taking every measure to win rather than ensuring players had fun. But I could not escape the game, it was everywhere. I've since learned to accept the game. I would argue that it's the game more than half the designers in the world would design if it didn't already exist. The inclusion of an Adventure Time theme is a match made in heaven, as both properties bear the humor of the same distant source material. With the right groups, this can be an amazing game. 

+Improves Munchkin in many ways
+There is a card in this game that punishes you for checking your phone.
-Still too random

Munchkin in a different skin. It does some things really well, like weird meta-effects affecting gameplay even more than base Munchkin does. Some things are done not so well. Like putting even more text on already small cards. You just can't get all the necessary info at a glance.

The character powers/asymmetry pushes this up a notch.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
One of the obvious changes with this expansion is the push for the cards to be more visual. Instead of a card saying it’s a two-handed item in the bottom left corner via text, there’s a picture of two arms/hands in the top right corner. Some of these changes made the game trickier to play for Munchkin veterans.

The theme is excellent and all the details it includes from the series makes me want to play it again eventually. The rules are terrible, there is nothing that will make you end the game. If none of the players was able to hold a lvl 1 (and this guarantees nothing) the game will go over 2-3 hours with everyone full of hatred.

The expansion adds an interesting twist with arenas that power up classes or monsters. The printing, packing and design are excellent. You will have a hard time having a group of friends that agree to play this more than twice.

An okay game to fill an hour of your life. 
It can be exciting and glorious, but also frustrating and hopeless. The game can be such a let down because I get attached to my character, my allies, my class, and my items just to get them all taken away in the blink of an eye. Game often become turbulent and bitter. However, It does do a good job at facilitating significant social interaction.

7.5 - I rate this slightly higher than base munchkin because the rules are cleaned up a little and I like the Adventure Time theme.

After a couple more plays I decided this version is the definitive version for me.  I prefer the theme, card layout, and character powers.  I hope there is an adventure time Munchkin expansion or two but frankly I think that the expansion fever is why I don't like regular munchkin as much. I gave away my original munchkin.

RATING: 8
Appearance: 10/10
Mechanics: 9/10
Clarity: 9/10
Pieces: A few

This game is so much fun that my circle rarely plays regular Munchkin anymore. It's perfect for Adventure Time fans, a great party game and very new player friendly.

The artwork is vibrant and colorful, but sometimes the rules can be a bit confusing. For instance there is a Monster that gets a stat boost if the person they're fighting has long or blond hair, however, no one can agree if thats in reference to your Character Card or your real life appearance. Other than that, this game's rules are pretty flexible and won't slow things down.

Be aware that this game does NOT come with its own board. You'll either have to use one from another Munchkin game, make one for yourself, or just stick some written on tape to the table to mark the levels.

Overall, this game is another must have if you like calamity, mayhem, and soul crushing rivalry.

However, I have read that it is probably the best version of Munchkins ard and based of the 4 versions I have played, I have to agree with that marginally

RATING: 6
I like this slightly better than the original Munchkin because of the Adventure Time theme. Not enough to bump it up an extra point, though.

RATING: 6.5
I have to admit, I'm not a fan of "re-skinned" games (although, somehow, I own many). That being said, I do find this has added a bit of life to Munchkin, for me. I love Adventure Time, and the theme fits well for Munchkin. Mathematical!...........but still just Munchkin.

If you like Munchkin, you'll like this.  The character cards add to the fun, and I like the idea of using them to track gender.

Go adventuring by kicking down doors and fighting evil monsters. Be the first player to level 10 by killing your enemies and sabotaging your opponents.

Characters are a good addition, makes the game feel stronger than vanilla munchkin.

The art is super and the theme fits perfectly - it's great if you like Munchkin.

Adventure Time + Munchkins!
A perfect mash of Adventure Time and Munchkins, making it a set that every Adventure Time fan needs. Choose from many Adventure Time characters and utilize their special abilities to get ahead of your friends. Backstabbing in all its Adventure Time goodness.

Haven't play due to someone in my group do not like the game.

Bought because of the theme (and cheap price). I don't mind if it's a good or bad game, I just want an Adventure time game as collection that actually has my favourite charaters in it.

A great addition for any Munchkin or Adventure Time fan.

A great Munchkin implementation - and the persistent characters add an interesting and in my opinion much needed dynamic!

Makes Munchkin fun, because Adventure time is awesome.  Also seems like the cards are more focused than the base game, which helps limit the length.

This game is fun enough.  My kids like it.  It gets a little repetitive after a few plays.   Simple to teach, theme is good and cards are funny.

Great theme for Munchkin. Won't change your mind if you are a munchkin hater.

Just not a fan of random chaos. Better then regular Munchkin because of theme alone. Still a waste of time.

RATING: 5
Adventure Time's quirkiness suits Munchkin well, but it still takes way too long to play for such a light opener/filler game.

Not much different than the original Munchkin. Fun if you're a fan of Adventure Time. Otherwise, I advise sticking with the original.

Changes to the format of standard munchkin cards, in terms of typography and layout. Combined with a large number of cards that confer modifiers to x type and y number of other cards made this version very difficult to track in comparison to others. Issue compounded when combined with other Munchkin games which usually play really well together.

RATING: 1
Adventure Time is the best thing ever.
Munchkin is the worst thing ever.
The theme doesn't even remotely fit the game.
I'd rather play regular munchkin (at gunpoint or for lot of money), it wouldn't disappoint this much.

Can be fun and unique, but often times drags on. it does make some crazy endings when more than one person is one level away from victory. Overall, I enjoy playing this every once in a while, but I prefer to have it more as a collection piece.

One of the better versions of Munchkin and I don't even watch Adventure Time. The theme just seems well suited to this game. A great game for Adventure Time fans.

GAME: Parthenon: Rise of the Aegean
RANK: 2653
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Different strategies available, lots of interesting decisions to make and nothing ever certain. The game benefits from repeated plays as players become familiar with the events that may occur. Can be long but down time is minimal. The game "purists" will probably hate it for the luck element that can be doled out by some powerful cards but these can be mitigated and you need to consider a risk management approach Whether the game will stand up to lots and lots of repeated plays remains to be seen and my initial rating may drop but for the moment I'm quite happy to recommend it. Main downside for me is the plethora of cards which make the table difficult to navigate. Some better implementation decisions could have been made to get rid of some of the cards.

That game was touted to me as an upgraded/deeper Settlers of Catan in a Games Magazine review. I think the overall feeling was that the game was somewhat linear and has quite a bit more luck and isn't nearly as good as the original Settlers.

A game of damage control.  I like the tech tree, but the damage control overshadows everything since it drives a player's success or failure.  Mildly complicated.  Little player interaction.  Okay artwork.  Would play again but not my first choice.

The game punches you in the gut, hits you over the head, and relieves you of your valuables. Then it ties you to a chair in its slowly-flooding basement and wakes you up so you can enjoy your slow demise. Hilarious once every couple of years.

No puedo decir que este sea un mal juego, pero creo que es un diseño francamente superado.

Un poco aleatorio en la fase de viajes, la suerte puede arruinar tu estrategia. Creo sinceramente que se disfruta más con muchos jugadores, pero a la hora de la verdad siempre hay otros juegos mejores que ocupan su sitio a la hora de jugar.

Se podría decir que es un juego del montón, que en su momento pasó sin pena ni gloria y que hoy en día con la avalancha de grandes títulos ha quedado un poco en el olvido.

Interesting.  The game is very well balanced, and the player interaction in the trading phase works well.  The random evilness can really screw you up, but that adds to the fun.  The game suffers severely from AP, which I didn't expect when I found it everyone would be playing their actions simultaneously.  Overall, however, I liked it.

RATING: 5.5
Unusual game. More about interaction and immersion than competition, as everyone need everyone to build its own civilisation (otherwise rely on pure luck). One of the rare games that let players express personal "playing styles" - instead of individual strategic variations.

Must mention the perfect clarity of the rulebook.

A basic problem with this game is that it is intimidating (many, many, many cards, with lots of text and a large rulebook), while it is very easy to learn, teach and play. It gives me the feeling that it stray away part of its fun inclined audience and deceive hardcore heavy gamers. I believe that both types of players may enjoy the game but the design (interfacing/mnemonic) flaws are overwhelming. The randomness of event cards (three different types!)combined with the inefficiency of the board/card design destroys the planning/trading system unless you're very experienced. Quite a long game for such a high level of randomness (while experienced players can somehow mitigate it).

Edited after many plays. Rating reduced from 7.5 to 5

RATING: 8.7
Nice civ game with opportunistic development and exceptional illustrations,but the trade between players could be replaced with another mechanic. Also,I am not at all sure of its replayability value. Still a game I very much enjoyed. 

meta-comment: I had the feeling of losing control towards the end of the game also in another Andrew Parks game, Core Worlds.

Very good trading/building game with many options on trading. Risk management and player screwage factors involved. Some element of luck, but that element fits to the theme ( ancient shipping/trading )

RATING: 5
very long game, in which you have to choose between everyone playing at the same time, and no control what others do, when it takes too long, and playing in turns, when it would take forever.  too strong the role of the archon, too big the effect of randomness in hazards draw, especially in the begining.  randomness vs game length ratio unacceptable. i could play this again if i have a LOT of time on my  hands, unlikely anytime soon. the game seems a bit unfinished - the armies, warships seem to be too weak, the whole concept of foreign lands with better exchange rate is broken by always there being a nearby port with a very cheap gold, etc.

Admittedly, I've only played this twice.  But so far I'm amazed at how balanced the game appears to be at the end despite what often seems to be brutal events/harbor cards that tend to hit some people very hard at the beginning of the game.  I'm not sure if the mechanics somehow are keeping the games balanced or if it's just coincidence, but I do enjoy this game.  I doubt I'd ever want to play Settlers again with this game as an option.

Will note, however, that the game doesn't seem to play as well with 3 people.  Just not enough interaction.

Pleasant buildup Civ game with little agression. One might feel there is too much randomness around but once you've played this a few times you'll be able to manage the risks and prepare for disasters. Downtime is very little due to simultanuous actions which is a problem for a lot of other civ games.There's just enough interaction through trading.

I so wanted to like this game that I just couldn't give it a truly bad rating, but I have now realized this game has some things I really dislike, and a 2 it is. In particular it is the event cards that get to me. They just hit too hard. I mean, game winning or losing hard. You can try to pre-empt some event cards by building some buildings that give you protective abilities, but you can't protect yourself against everything. If you pull the wrong event you are just gone from the game, unless your fellow players have similar bad luck. So in the end the game is decided by the players who have had most luck with the event cards. And that sucks.

Big disappointment.  I usually love the mechanics involved: pick-up-and-deliver, city building, exploration, trading, etc... but this one fell flat.  Too much randomness from the harbor status cards and the sailing hazard cards, and players have little ability to mitigate the luck/randomness.

This game leans heavily on the deck of random events, that are the primary determinant for player separation.  For players that like dramatic moments of revelation, this could be a good thing, but not to me.  I don't like when a 3 hour "strategy" game is determined by the flip of a card.

A cross between Settlers of Catan and Puerto Rico (kinda). It's a pretty good game. I'll probably rate it an 8 after I play it a couple more times.

edit: I haven't played this in years! I'd love to give it another shot.

edit: I've been meaning to try it out again but the rulebook is so damn daunting! I mean it's nothing compared to the ones for say, Starcraft or Tide of Iron, but for a euro, it's huge!

Impression:  This is a game with a lot of cards.  To see a player's status, you may need to examine several cards, which could slow things down -- or cause players to decide not to bother.  Play before purchasing.

(1 play) It's nothing more but a first impression, but 6 players (all of them new to the game) seem to be too many, but then again 6 experienced players might be ok. I will try it with 3 or 4 players as soon as possible.

I don't mind the difficulty of crossing the sea and trying to get gold or papyrus -- I actually find that challenging.  However, combining this with the overpowering effects of the event cards made it impossible to get any traction.  Hard to gain ground when you're being destroyed by events.  There is too much luck overall, both in the harbor cards and the hazard cards.

RATING: 7.5
With 4 works very well. Easy to follow rules and clear. 1st play 3 hrs but because of the initial rounds; then everything goes quick. Guess that in 2 hrs at most can be completed. Don't like much luck games based on dice or cards, but in this case I must admit it works great. No kingmaker for me and you know at every moment if you are winning or not; time to improve. With a quicker game can level up to an 8. Don't understand why is this game so low in the ranks. Can be play with non gamers.

The family hated this - it's far too brutal. Events are designed to really sock it to you. If you go in expecting that, it's OK. But it can feel like a kick in the teeth each turn, which isn't great. At least it's better than going twice around the table with no resource rolls in Settlers!

Played a few rounds of this solitaire and I have to say, it's actually rather neat. I can see it replacing Settlers perhaps, though there is more you need to know about posible future games states than with Settlers. I like the model of guaranteed production that you may lose (or be forced to spend sub-optimally) rather than the likelihood of a good portion of the game spent not producing at all.

A really good game! I like the trading/building mechanics and travelling factor to get a good price for the goods. There’s a lot to do and a lot of micromanagement when trying to figure out which way to get the most out of it.
The randomness of hazards adds atmosphere but never leaves a player behind due to bad luck.
The game can get a little chaotic at times but if the players tell what they have done in the round it helps a lot.

Played once. One really good idea, the journeying thing, does not provide sufficient interest to overcome the lackluster remainder. This was apparently a coroprate team-building game before it was a commercial game product, and it shows; there are too few choices, and game railroads you into cooperating with your fellow-players in specific ways. A shame; I wanted to rate it higher, but it's just not there. I think it could have been a 7 in the hands of a good development house.

Has a Civ-lite feel but still takes a good while. The randomness of the hazards are similar to the calamities in Civilization and can knock you back quite a bit. I liked the idea of appointing an Archon each season but his or her power really comes down to choosing who will lose odd comodities. I prefer Civilization (by Tresham/AH) as at least you have armies and fleets that move around on a nice looking area map and can do battle.

RATING: 7
Although this game was fun to play, I had a few problems with it that prevented me from rating it higher.  First of all, much of the game is a little too random for my tastes; the event cards, wonders, and sailing hazards are all randomly drawn, and some are more difficult to deal with than others--or more difficult given certain starting islands.  There are ways of getting around some of this randomness later on, but bad luck, especially early in the game, can really ruin one's chances.  Also, for a game of its length, takes up so much space and has so many cards!  To give it credit, its design made it easy to learn the game.  When I first saw the sheer number of cards the game involved, I thought the rules explanation would be extra-long, but the cards and player aids are simple to understand.

RATING: 6
Three hours of wading through fiddly mechanics to find out who the luckiest player was.  Sure, over an infinite (or even a large) number of trials, fortune will balance -- but if you are unable to sail for three or four turns straight, especially near the beginning of the game, you are out, regardless of what "risk management" steps you take.  Nice components, great graphics, an inspired game -- but just too few chances to recover when things don't go your way.  The only way to avoid losing Parthenon: don't play.

Just played it today with 4 doesn't seem to really work well with that number, seems like a 6 player only game, really wasn't that great, the sea events can be very swinging and some of the 'year' events seem downright broken, mainly the Persian Tribute and the one where if you don't have pottery you don't produce basic goods, they seem to take you out of contention. It reminds me very much of Settlers, only less elegant and much longer.

I think a lot of the folks who are whining about the luck element and the presence of extremely powerful random events have only played the game once and just weren't prepared to plan for them.  Parthenon is an excellent game, sort of a median between the styles of games represented by Settlers, Puerto Rico, and Civilization.  However, there's much more detail and less luck than Settlers, a looser and therefore more flexible structure than Puerto Rico, and a more efficient play time than Civilization.  I do think the game might be a little weird in the production curve and the 10 tiebreakers are a little extraneous.  I think the Archon role isn't as powerful or effective as it seems like it ought to be and sometimes that part of the game feels superfluous.  Those complaints aside, this is one of the better games of the year so don't let the handful of folks who happened to lose all their goods on one shipping trip spoil it for you.

RATING: 6
Nov. 25, 2007 -- Tentative rating of 6. The first play was a bit rough, even though we managed to get most of the rules right. The first few turns were a little confusing, as we tried to understand the rules and how everything fit together, and even by the end of the game, some elements still weren't making a whole lot of sense. Now that I've seen what cards can come up in each year, subsequent plays should be more enjoyable, although the game seems like it could also be pretty dry and not have enough player interaction. 6/10

Jan. 18, 2008 -- The second play was a big improvement over the first one. Whereas the first game was dry, dull and confusing, the second play was more entertaining. Having a better understanding of what I needed to do probably helped. While I'm not thrilled with the ordered laundry list of win conditions, this is a game I'd play again -- probably not often enough to change my rating, but still once in awhile. 6/10

RATING: 6.5
I enjoyed this game a fair amount. It has quite a bit of theme and great production value. I think this game gets slammed too much by people. Yes there is some luck involved, but a majority of the luck is more risk management. If you are prepared then you can avoid, or hamper the negative effects. Besides who really thinks that boats didn't get sunk while trying to ship goods in those days!!! It fits with the theme and I think it even added to the excitement. I don't always go for luck, but I find in this game it works out and plays towards the theme just fine. The only real problem with this game is the end game. It always seems to come down to the 4th or 5th tie-breaker to see who actually won. While this does make things close, it kind of dilutes the focus of the game because every body seems to be able to get the wonders

RATING: 2
Too many problems to mention. Maybe someday I'll have the time and energy to write a review. I was actually optimistic about this (I bought it), and thought things were going fine the first few turns, but by the end of the game, I knew I would never play again. Thank goodness someone bought it off me.

I enjoy trading in any game and the voting for Archon generated good banter early on.

To be competitive, it seems it's essential to keep an eye on everybody else's status and deny them the resources the leader needs, whilst gathering those helpful to yourself. No-one really watched everyone else though and despite that, it still lasted 3 1/2 hours. 

Trading and voting for Archon are the only opportunities to affect the other players - a sizable time is spent calculating what best to trade with other countries and so it did start to feel lacking in ways to interact.

I could be talked into playing this again but would happily go without.

There's a lot to like about this game.  A lot of cards.  A lot of options. A lot of activity. There's not a great deal of player interaction, except when trading, but two things stand out above the others that make this game great for me. First, there's almost no downtime.  All players are involved in every phase. This prevents the lack of interaction from becoming like multi-player solitaire, as everybody's doing something all the time.  Second, and best, is that the designer reads the forums, and answers every question about the game.  That kind of support is rare, and raises it above the level of just a good game, to an excellent one.  I will gladly play this game, anytime, anywhere.

Unfortunately, this just didn't get to the table enough, mostly because it does not work with only 2-players.

A seriously underdeveloped game. The basic idea while not novel is very cool but it simply doesn't work as it is. Scripted start and too few decisions to be taken during the game. It's mainly about drawing the right hazards when you travel and not get hit by the events. The Archon voting seems rather pointless too, perhaps have it move around the table instead?

Players represent a Greek island, trading and constructing their way to victory.  Each island produces Settlers type commodities that can be traded amongst other players for other commodities.  This quickly builds a local infrastructure (produce more stuff), which eventually forces you overseas to trade for rare stuff and gold.  Sailing is dangerous - each time you do it you draw from the "Age of Exploration" deck of doom, which could bring pirates, storms, or if you're amazingly luckly, good weather.  To win, you have to complete a couple of wonders which you pick up in recipe format, and building all of your buildings in your deck helps too.  It's a streamlined game that plays well, however the luck of voyages is going to annoy some, and the island (i.e. player) trading just doesn't feel necessary enough.  It leaves you with the feeling that it could have been really good, but just falls short.  Great looking game, but very large with several decks of full size playing cards to scatter around the table - half size cards for buildings, resource cubes and player screens would have been much better here.

Suffer's from the same problem as Smugglers of the Galaxy does: random events tend to destroy players. It's not *as* bad, but it's still pretty bad. We played partway through a game and stopped because one player was destroyed beyond all possibility of recovery by random effects.

You won't catch me playing this one again. Economic game in which randomness tends to randomly shove people backwards? No thank you.

RATING: 3.67
Lack of meaningful player interaction, weak theme, bland trading mechanics, generic civilizations and high luck factor made this game a flop for my gaming group.  

Especially displeasing is the influence of random factors.  A single bad draw from the Hazard Deck can wreck your entire turn (and you only get 12 turns). These unfortunate events often occur before you can develop the opportunity to mitigate the risk.

In my last game, my wife and I were both frustrated repeatedly as we attempted to gather the resources required to construct a Great Harbor (for warships to control the risk of pirates), a Shrine (for Gifts of Poseidon to control the risk of storms) or for an Academy (for a Philosophy like Stoicism to control risk of both Hazards).  IMHO, a player's ability to manage risk (a defense often raised for the randomness of the game) is itself subject to too many random factors.

Composite rating of 3.67 reflects my rating of 3, my wife's rating of 4, and my sister's rating of 4.  For the time invested, we would have gotten a much larger fun payoff by playing Advanced Civilization (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/1770).

I have been playing this game through all its many incarnations. My favorite portion of it is the when you get that BIG PAYOFF. I like taking the big risks during any year of the game. Sometimes I do that just to try and pull ahead early in the game. I will usually try to keep one ship going to a sure thing while the other is loaded to the rafters. On more than one occasion I might get very greedy and try high risk every season hoping to make it at least once for that year. But not knowing whats going to happen is an aspect of the game I enjoy.

RATING: 5.5
Hilariously outsized game which has its merits.  I'm always going to give the benefit of the doubt to a huge, shambling design like this, because we need more of this type and less of the anorexic efficiency Euro for short attention spans.  That said, this reminds me a lot of the better received Fire & Axe, with a less punitive luck element and a less successful end game.  It also seems to share a lot in common with Mare Nostrum, but with more charm.

It does fall a bit flat at the end, making one briefly wonder if the card explosion was worth it all.  The winning conditions are extremely straightforward, and everyone keeps pretty close pace.  It ends up as a three-hour race game decided by a tiny efficiency margin - something like a long run on a treadmill.  The simultaneous actions make it playable with six, but they also reduce interaction, because you are not very invested in what other people are doing.  Interaction is pretty limited and subtle as it is.

RATING: 7.5
A pick-up-and-deliver system, but has more trading than Antike, and also more luck (hence it is more about risk management, and is also more thematic).  Great atmosphere of trading and civilization building, if you can handle the luck aspect (deal with random events by diversifying), fiddliness, and length.  Be aware of risque artwork on the Aegis cards.  Time seems to fly when you're playing it, and there's very little down time because everyone is involved at the same time.  Have figured out a workable two-player variant (see my post in Variants forum).  Appears best with 3 players and 6.  I love the resource collection, trading, and building.  People seem to love or hate it, depending on how they handle the random elements, but I find it makes the game quite thematic/epic.  I'd like to try a 6 player game.  Info about how to set-up the game neatly with all the cards: [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/310245]here[/url]

Thoughts about the luck element: It is very much a game of risk management, and the "luck" element (Hazards, Events, etc), can trump your strategic choices.  But it is intended to be a game with luck, because that's what civ type games are about, they have random events and "story" - having a luck element fits with the theme and the overall game.  But I can see that not everyone likes it for this reason.

Fun with the right people, but there is a high luck element in the cards, and it can take a very long time to play.  Much of the luck can be mitigated by giving yourself defensive bonuses with armies and warships, but even just the luck in the Event and Harbour cards can make a huge difference in who gets a boost and who gets knocked down.

RATING: 6
A rather good trading game which is slightly marred by the fact that players are generally left to the whim of the gods (and/or the player holding the Archon marker).  Would perhaps have worked better (and looked better) if there were other materials in the game representing the commodities; but then the problem of how to hide one's fleet cargo would arise.

A couple of points here; if you're going to play remember that most of the game is played simultaneously.  Dwell too long on what other players are doing before you make your decision to build and the game is going to drag.

Secondly, try to have everything as central as possible; production means mayhem at the table.

There are a LOT of cards, well over a dozen different types.  They are all the same size and nearly all the same colour tones.  I might be rough to learn this game from the rules without having someone with experience.  It almost seemed like a solitaire game with a brief trading period to acquire the things you can't make yourself.  It was nearly a straight optimization race game with a bit of randomness based on the trading with others and how your shipping works out with the events and harbor effects cards.

I soooo want to like this game.  It's got trading, building, risk-taking, and earned special abilities that change the nature of you situation as you play.  Unfortunately... the game is to long, slow, fiddly and random.  The worst part is how long it takes (tens of minutes) to realize a series of simple steps when you can clearly see the obvious path forward.  The massive waiting time as you tick off your obvious series of end-games trades, journeys and builds just sucks all the tension out of the game. I wanted to rate it a "3" but part of that rating says "I could be convinced to play it again".  Won't happen.  For a full de-brief see: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/83035

This is one of my favorite games from last year. Yes, it can be unforgiving, but it is also a well designed game with lots of tough decisions to make each turn as you weigh the risks vs. reward of quickly expanding your island and building and trading with the neighboring islands...or going slowly and building the protections you might need before heading out to sea.

The production design of this game is very sub-optimal -- the huge number of cards make it very hard to determine how other people are doing (a critical part of the game). In addition, the randomness, while a natural part of the game's theme, really hurts due to the importance of steady development and the length of the game. I really want to like this game but just can't quite manage to.

In theory, this game is one that I should love, love, and love some more.  I like the theme, I like trading games, and I like Civ games.  For some reason, this one didn't grab.  I think it may have to do with the fact that you never really have a civ to look over.  You have your boats, and you have 18.5 million cards to keep track of.  I never felt like I had my own little trading empire.  It is also very difficult to see how others are progressing, let alone yourself.  Even so, I enjoyed my playing just fine and I am happy to play it again.  Maybe it will grow on me with further playings, but for now, it is just a cruel tease.  :)

This is the neareast I've seen of "Civ light", due to the well-balanced and smoothed trading part. The only is that you need to know the cards better to get a quicker gaming time.

Well, my first experience with the game was hard. I think you will need a few more tries to really get this. But it was an interesting experience and I will gladly try again. It has some interesting concepts. I am particularly fond of the scarcity of some goods for different nations and how that play out in the trading phase.

I am a firm believer that this plays best with 6 players.

RATING: 6
This game has a lot of aspects I like - resource management, trading and building. It does rely on some luck because of card draws for harbour status, events and hazard cards but I think part of the fun is trying to adapt to the different challenges thrown up.

The early stages don't usually offer many choices to the players as everyone is usually busy building their other villages but once you are into year 2 there is usually the opportunity to make your mark with a bit of strategic trading and building. However, every game I have played has been very close and has gone to at least the 6th or 7th tie breaker which makes me wonder if different strategies actually make much difference.

I'm also not entirely sure it has the staying power and replayability and it seems like it can be a little unbalanced with less than 6 players.

Overall, despite my misgivings, I think this is a decent game.

RATING: 5
The limited set of things to do mean that the game can actually be won with the allotted 3 years (12 turns). At least if everyone is playing nice. If anyone starts playing against the others the cycle of revenge will probably slow things to a crawl and the alternate win conditions will probably kick in.  Even so, the game ran close to 3 hours with 6 people and the events just inject random chaos into an otherwise rather mundane process.

This is an empire building game with a risk management component.  I must say I was surprised how balanced the game could be, as I had the impression the random events had taken me out of the game on three occasions, yet I was one turn away from winning at the end of the third year.

The Island Trading aspect reminds me of CIV, as it's open and everyone tries to trade for the resources he/she needs.  Planning and the ability to think on your feet pays dividends here.

One must take advantage of the Surplus and Shortages which are occuring on the board, but must also take into account if these are occuring at a neighboring land or further away, as the number of event cards doubles.

Rating is based on a single play.  I am looking forward to trying this one again as my rating will most likely go up!

It's not as complex as I thought it would be. Lots of cards, and lots of action. A 4P game took 15 minutes to learn, and 3 hrs to play. It is your basic "civ" game--build up production, produce goods, trade goods, and turn in specific sets to build buildings and monuments. What is neat is the Fleet Trading action, which requires shipping goods to far-away lands to be able to trade more efficiently, and also for more valuable (rare) goods, especially Gold, which is a necessity for the advanced buildings. However, there are hazards and harbor events, along with annual events that could hamper your plans, such as Pirates, Storms, Tributes, and Blockades. You need Warships, Gifts to Poseidon, and Armies respectively to get around those problems. That means going abroad to get Warships/Armies, or building the advanced buildings: Great Harbor, Fortress, or Shrine. There is some luck involved as the hazards are random in type and frequency--a bad draw could set you back a turn or make you lose all of your goods. There's also the Academy, which allows you to buy certain Philosophies, which allow you to ignore specific game events, giving you a powerful edge. The trading is fast and furious, as it is all a race to build all of your buildings and monuments first. However, the way each civilization produces goods is asymmetrical--advances rely on a diverse set of goods, so trading is a necessity. All in all, a fun game. As far as "civ" games go, this is how I would rank them in terms of playing time, from shortest to longest AND difficulty: 1) Roll Through the Ages, 2) Phoenicia, 3) Antike, 4) Parthenon, 5) Through the Ages, 6) Civilization. Antike has a more abstract civ mechanism, but has the most emphasis on expansion and battles. Parthenon is closer to building a civilization, with almost zero conflict (except for how the Archon can be potentially used to screw other players).

Update (01/14/12): After not playing this for nearly 18 months, I am not too excited about playing this when it is suggested. It seems 30 minutes too long at 3 hours for a semi-light civ game, not enough meaningful decisions due to the various simplifications, and too involved to regurgitate the rules. I'm dropping it to a '7' from an '8'.

Play with 3 or 6 players.

After a couple of plays I haven't seen much variation in the way this game plays out & I don't see how there could be.  Maybe if you could attack each other's islands ...


The current version of the Ender's Game two-player variant:
Preparation: Take the three starting islands (Crete, Chios, and Rhodes), and randomly select one for each player; the third and remaining island becomes the neutral island.
Rule adjustments:
1. players take seasonal turns being Archon 
2. at the beginning of the trade phase, players may trade with the neutral third island as follows:
a) both players may make a trade in turns (beginning with the Archon), and are limited to a maximum of two such trades each per season.
b) commodities available for trade are limited to what the neutral island can produce in a single turn (expendable as they are traded, but replenished at the beginning of each season).
c) each player may only trade their basic monopoly commodity with the basic commodities of the neutral island at a rate of 1:1, and trade rare commodities with the rare commodity of the neutral island at a rate of 2:1.

Still the favorite of my game group a year later. Rewards multiple plays. Plays large numbers of players well, as everyone plays in parallel, yet there's still a lot of fun interaction from trading, sharing information on ports, and the Archon appointed hazards. After several plays the strategies, player limitations and ways to prepare for hazards upcoming have become more apparent.

Knowing the Event hazard cards that could come up each year makes a huge difference --with newbies we'll read through each year's six cards that are possible, THEN shuffle them and draw once they know what that year could hold. And now our group works together to eliminate "bad event" cards before they appear --like if everyone builds one army before year 3 then Persian War is easy to fend off when it appears.

The main rules our group got wrong:

You can't trade a Surplus good for other goods at the same port. You can with Shortage, but not Surplus. (So trading 2 basics for 4 surplus is okay. But you can't then trade the 4 Surplus for 1 Gold at the Surplus port! They're only worth 1/4th a normal basic, you'd need 16 of the Surplus good to get 1 gold!) 

If a Hazard targets the player with "the most", but they are protected from that Hazard (either by having a Wonder against storms or a Warship against Pirates), it still only targets them, they're just immune to its effects. So everyone with less goods on their ship than the guy with "the most" who also has the Warship  ...is also protected from Pirates since that Hazard card targets the one person immune to its effects.

Great Lighthouse and Temple of Isis only protect against STORMS. Pirates still raid these players.

You can't lose Aegis cards on fleets to Pirates. But you can lose them to storms!

Only six slots per fleet on the RETURN voyage also.

Only one build per acropolois building per turn. (ie At the fortress you can only build 1 army from grape-olive-wheat per turn. Unless you build the alternate fortress, in which case you can build 2 per turn, 1 at each Fortress)

Each Island is only allowed to build one Alternate Acropolis Structure per game.

The Market accepts any combo of the 3 goods you can't produce yourself to make gold. Even duplicate goods, or all 3 the same. (We thought it had to be one of each all unique at first.)

Stocicism is once per year, not once per journey phase.

RATING: 7
First game with 4 players. Parthenon has a convincing theme, which is enhanced by the generally attractive components (although there is a surfeit of cards). The heart of the game - building - is not handled in an original way but works well enough, except that it is difficult to see what edifices the other players have constructed. I like the fact that there is some asymmetry in the player positions; each island has different building possibilities and starts with a different bonus. The voyage mechanism is the most interesting in the game but, unfortunately, can be frustrating as it injects a certain element of chance. Player interaction is perhaps too limited - most trading occurs at ports rather than between player islands and the Archon's role is marginal.

Some nice concepts, but overall execution is flawed.

_Tedious_ game above all and rather pointless.

Other problems:
- too _long_ and yet at the same time several areas are left unexplored/underexplored til the very end

- different paths seem to exist only before the game - in fact you always follow similar route: villages, 1 or 2 workshops, often Great Harbor (only 2 Gold), then acropolis structures which you can afford easily (i.e. requiring the Rare resource you produce) and then more problematic ones with the Treasury being last/one of the last buildings erected (4 different Rare resources make it really difficult to build).  Same linear progress = yaawn...

And the reported randomness (->Hazard and Harbor Status cards) is the smallest issue in view of the problems mentioned above :>

RATING: 4
Some good ideas in the game and it has some special powered things which I liked, it also has the trading and port aspect of Settlers which I liked as well but this game has 3 BIG strikes against it which makes it unplayable for me ever again:

1. Game length is much too long for this

2. Too much luck and randomness for a game this long, 1 hour of something like Settlers can be tolerated but 3 hours of something with this much luck can not. 

3. Ultra fiddly as there are so many cards for this and for that, especially the resources. While some things in the game might be able to be tweaked, this part can not be without a lot of work. 
 
Pros:

 - Multiple paths? 
 - Lots of cards would be different games so good replay
 - Minimal downtime

Cons: 

 - Despite trading there is a lack of interaction
- Spending time to vote for Archon but role is very weakly implemented
 - Somewhat scripted especially the beginning where moves are very obvious
 - Decision making uninteresting

More notes: 

 - 1/4 of the way through the game, your basic resources are worth nothing beyond trade fodder and you do little more than shuffle the cards around for most of the game.  

 - The process of actually travelling to each individual island takes too long and involves the possibility that 1) you may lose all your goods before you even get to the island! And 2) even if you made it there, you may not be able to use the port, as there are potentially restrictions or fines at every location! Of course all of these obstacles take place in the form of randomly drawn cards - you are at the mercy of the cards before you can even have the chance to do something that takes a minute to figure out but 20 minutes to play out!  

While game-time would shorten once familiar and you could maybe somewhat better prepare yourself for the random events and nasty sea perils all this is not enough to save the game as decisions will become more obvious also and it will still be far too long and luck riddled, this has been done better in other games. While in some ways it is a step up from Settlers in a big big way it is a step down as this is much longer. Settlers has the same flavour, is much shorter and more streamlined compared to this. If you like long trading games and high luck, then give this a try, otherwise... the game was okay but the execution was quite poor.

RATING: 3.1
Not a bad game but not particularly good either. The randomness of the event, harbor, and hazard cards adds a LOT of luck. Travel to the right city at the right time and you're in great shape but if the opposite happens you're screwed. This can be even worse if you get hit by a storm or pirates during travel. 1/4 of the way through the game, your basic resources are worth nothing beyond trade fodder and you do little more than shuffle cards for most of the game. Way too many cards that would have been more effective as tiles. If you like trading games and high luck, then give this a try, otherwise...

This doesn't play well with three people, but four or five players is fun (I haven't tried six). It's an interesting game because it has somewhat of a Euro feel, though there is quite a bit of luck involved, as well as some minor elements of directly screwing other players. This game has more more types of cards than any other game I've seen.

Rating and comments based on a single game.

Another disappointment. I had, if not high hopes then at least reasonable expectations for this game. The ancient Mediterranean is a theme, and trading and travelling are mechanics that all appeal to me. But Parthenon still fell flat.

The first couple of turns were OK, and I were thinking "I might like this". Then the next few turns were more of the same, and the mechanics were starting to feel more than a little dull and repetitive. Turns out one has to struggle through up to 12 turns of "produce resource cards, trade some of them for other resources, buy stuff with your resource cards". By the end of the game (which luckily happened with a sudden death victory after turn 9 or 10) I was silently hoping for somebody, *anybody* to put me out of my misery. We had been playing for about 3 hours at this point.

Surprisingly, my main disappointment with the game was not the randomness of the hazard cards drawn when travelling (which I must admit I had somewhat feared) but rather the length and repetitiveness of the whole exercise. Now, lengthy and repetitive can be OK (think Goa or Caylus) but not when married to trading and severe random events.

In short, while I liked certain aspects of the game, on the whole this is most probably not a game for me. I should give it another chance I suppose, but with so many other games waiting for table time, I have a hard time seeing it happen.

I like this game and the idea of this game - but I think it takes longer than it should and is considerably slowed down by the use of the cards for commodities as you are constantly handing out cards (production & trading) and then taking them back (building, losses). The player card should have some tracks in which you mark your current status for these things - that would probably halve the time needed to play this game. But there is a lot going on, a lot of different things to be aware of at all times, you must be paying attention to what other players are doing - all in all, a lot of fun.

Excellent game. The mechanics of producing, trading, and building blend together very well. It sounded very complicated at first, but after 2 seasons we seemed to catch on quite well. It does have a high random factor in the Event/Hazard/Harbor Status cards, but they all can be mitigated w/ careful planning (well except for a bad Event at Season 1Year One...)

As the Standard Deviation indicates, this probably isn't a game that everyone will like, but after my first play, I am on board. The game has a bit of a learning curve as far as gameplay, but once you get through a season or two it's not so bad. There is also a bit of a luck element in that Event cards often hit some players harder than others, but they can be nipped in the bud with good play (and a little luck). The artwork is just gorgeous, though the sheer quantity of cards can be intimidating. I still like the game very much.

RATING: 8
Rating based on about 10-15 plays, the most recent being an exciting come from behind victory in which I defeated the game designer, Andrew Parks.  I really feel alot of the low ratings and adverse comments about the luck-based aspects of this game are misguided, and perhaps the result of poor teaching and incomplete understanding of some of the key aspects of the game, such as risk management and protection from the events.  The trading sequence and the Archon power are great equalizing factors to bring down a runaway leader, and in fact, usually one doesn't want to be the perceived leader when playing the game.  The only possible criticisms I might offer would be the components (the game would have been easier to put away and set up if some of the different types of cards were of different thicknesses and sizes) and one possible gameplay issue regarding the player who has the misfortune of being unable to obtain gold.  My proposal would be to allow a player to turn in sets of basic cards they do not produce (as if that player had a Marketplace) but a set in a larger number, such as 4-6 cards, to compensate for possibly being stuck with a bunch of basic cards they couldn't do anything with at the end of the turn that would otherwise have to be discarded.

Played a few games.  Very good trading game and a nice change to Settlers.  Like the push your luck mechanic with the storms and pirates.

RATING: 4
I have to join the negative buzz on this game. We played with three which should be about the best number of players. But the weaknesses of this game left me unsatisfied after 2.5-3 hours of play.
Our game didn't see a single move worth remembering. One player got a headstart because his starting commodities could both be traded at a premium in turn one and we never caught up. While there are many possibilities to spend your commodities, it doesn't make a big difference in which order you build them as long as you build something at all.
Trading was lacklustre as we basically tried to avoid the dangers of shipping as much as possible. Due to the symmetry of the commodities there usually is a logical best solution to the trading. The fleet trading and building phases are stressful when everybody trades and builds at the same time. It's ok when you play with reliable players but if there is just a single sloppy player around things can get uncomfortable. Even if he doesn't intend to mess things up. It will happen.
The archon didn't have to make a single meaningful decision making this feature of the game totally superfluous. The hazards hit as expected and can't be fully prepared against. But that's the least of its weaknesses.
Instead of Parthenon I rather play 3 games of San Juan which offer the same goal of building up your city/island with much more meaningful decisions in a shorter time frame and less random.

This game has 3 parts: building, trading, and luck mitigation. When you go sailing off to foreign parts, you should always know the odds of things going wrong, and know how to mitigate them or be able to afford the loss.

A card-heavy board game of tech development, we were impressed by the game mechanics but the trading at the table felt kind of lop-sided with 3 players, and the hazard effects and season events were not popular with the people I played with.

The focus of the game in two descriptions would be resource management and risk mitigation. Some people either don't find risk mitigation fun, or need to get stung a few times to learn it. Either way, I will have trouble bringing this one to the table again...

RATING: 6
OK civilisation and trading game. Get the basic economics going and start building! It helps to know the events that can occur during each year and the possible harbor statusses. The hazard cards for the sea travels introduce a completely random effect with a very huge impact (might even prevent a player from doing anything during a complete turn). Although this will hit all players eventually, this is not really a good balancing mechanism because the more advanced cities will suffer less compared to the already weaker cities (as the stronger cities have more acropolis that might offer ways to counter the bad events). An early leader is difficult to catch (certainly in a three player game, as the Archon is mostly determined at random)! **** Note: I won both the game sessions that I have played (a five player and a three player game).

This is a very fiddly, computation-heavy game with multiplayer negotiation and random event cards and unbalanced starting configurations.  There's a decent theme and a good idea for a game tucked in there, but the different optimizations and piles of different cards lengthen out something that is heavily influenced by a few card draws.  While "luckier" event draws can result in a more playable game, it's not worth sitting through the stinkers, especially since all games will involve big piles of fiddly cards and repetitive analysis.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
The big problems:

Two many cards.  It takes to long to set up.  The build deck makes it difficult to tell what other players have.

The first few turns of the game provide decisions which could only cause a new player to screw up.  A player playing correctly will avoid trading any goods on the first two turns, except an extra one on the second turn purely for exploration purposes.  The next coulple turns will be spent only maximizing production.

Hazards in the oceans make trading unprofitable when not required to get gold and rare commodities.  After the player passes the hazards, the port status may randomly punish the player.  The hazards punish a player for attempting to be active, something which is not a hallmark of a good game.

Trading isn't very interesting.  While the game looks a bit like a buy-low sell-high trading simulation, except for good port status cards there's very little of that going on.  There's very little differentiation in the ports other than the 4 items that can only be purchased at one port.

The commodities aren't very interesting.  The rare comodities have buildings associated with them, but the other commodities are mostly the same, with very little except port status cards and army/warship building to differentiate them.

This is great fun. Feels like a _game_ and not just playing out 'game mechanics'. Yes, you can get lucky/unfortunate in this game, but it does seem to even itself out. And you can prepare for more or less for any event in the game. It takes a lot of time but it's not a brain burner in any sense. You'll get it the second time you play (just be prepared that the first game will drag if a lot of (non-prepared) new players, took us 4 hours+ first time). You can come back from behind and win it. Except for the chaos trading part, little interaction between players. Can be tought to younger players. Probably plays best with 4 or 6 players. Rating after two games (This may go down to an 8, need to play it more).

RATING: 7.5
Played Saturday night at GenCon through two years (8 seasons) of three.  Z-Man designer Andrew on hand to get us started.

You must complete all the builings on your Island card (Crete etc.) to win, This includes a Wonder out several in the Wonder deck. Players were differentiated by their villages producing only three of the six basic commodities forcing trade amongst the islands and risky trips to neighboring lands (Cathage, Egypt and Italy).

I agree with many of the comments - a good deal of balance, some nasty surprises when sailing out to trade further away e.g. arriving at Eqypt to find the port Blockaded and you having to return home with commodities you now will likely have to discard.

Since we were learning, the Archon acted mostly in a benevolent fashion - when we found the Persians at our doorstep demanding seasonal tribute and no one had Forts, the Archon took the first hit (one Gold). But since the "event" cards apply for all subsequent seasons, 2 of 4 found themselves having to give up two producing villages each. In a nasty game the Archon could have wrecked one or two players by repeatedly assigning the damage.

Game components were top notch and fortunately the commodity cards - basic, rares (NO - not collectables) and gold were full sized. Had they been Civ sized it would have been a pain.

One aspect we also played nice about was trading. While there are no disasters to  trade like in Civ, more advanced play could see parties wanting more than one-for-one trades.

There are other aspects such as building Armies, Warships, Gifts of Poseidon. Using an Army with a village doubles production - which in one turn allowed me to gain 5 Gold. This gives completed structures some purpose beyond satifying end of game goals.

My rating could go up with more plays.

I will likely be an owner after returning to GenCon today...

Wow this game is truely cruel and merciless. It is however, VERY even overall. By the end, we found that with a few more plays, and the experience that would bring, we could build more intuitively to ease the pain of those nasty events and hazards.

Decisions about what to build are often obvious. What's left is risk management (and its random outcome).
There are six basic resources, but the difference is releveant for only a few buildings, so trading becomes pretty much useless on the second half of the game. 
The diplomatic aspect is annoying as in any multiplayer game relying on it (targeted screwage, bash the leader, etc.).
Random, fiddly, repetitive. 
It'd be much nicer as a filler, but alas it's as long as a "meaty" game.

RATING: 5.2
Very nice presentation with all the cards.  The basics of the game are  not anything too revolutionary.  I felt that two things hurt the game.  One is the length- just too long for a game that basically is quite repetitive and a bit solitaire-ish at times. Two, there is a luck factor that starts to actually effect your chances, and you are helpless at times to overcome it.  I was about 50% unsuccessful in overseas trading/journeying due to the hazards, and early on, this really hurts me.  With no way to gain enough protection early in the game, this beciames a real problem.
Besides all that, the trading aspect sounds cool, but with everyone trading everything, you get little sense of control, no one is paying attention to whether or not you should trade to someone the commodity they want (persons who are in the lead, maybe one should NOT trade with them the rare commodity).  

I wouldn't say no to playing again, but I just think there are better games to play than this one, and are much shorter.

This lingered on our shelves for the longest time, both due to its awkward ideal player number of either three or six, and because I gathered from the rules and witness reports here on the Geek that it’s not a game that works for, or with, everybody. Being practically forced at gunpoint to trade with each other in a competitive game is unique enough, but coupling this need for cooperation with events and travel hazards that can completely trainwreck your plans is not for everybody.

That said, if you manage to assemble a trio or even a double trio of gamers who can take a beating with a smile, work together and can gauge the overall situation well enough to determine who is in the lead, Parthenon provides you with a very rewarding mixture of game and experience.

In some ways, it can be regarded as an evolution of Valley of Mammoths. The external events forced onto the players are similarly hard to plan for and to deal with, but the player dynamic is the complete opposite: where Valley requires you to further twist the knife and oust an unlucky opponent from the game, player interaction in Parthenon is almost exclusively beneficial, which makes it a much more subtle, strategic and – to me, at least – enjoyable game. The wonderful illustrations by Stephen Walsh are icing on the cake.

Something like Settlers of Catan meets Civ, this could be an interesting game if the hazards were not so horribly destructive.  I would consider playing it again with a modification to the hazard deck/system.  Without any changes, they can be far too destructive to the best laid plans.

Epic trading game for 3-6, where each player plays an Aegean island producing particular goods, which can then be traded with other players, or with overseas ports at various exchange rates. Shipping is fraught with perils however. First player to build up their island wins. Production and trading reminiscent of Settlers, special ability buildings reminiscent of Puerto Rico. Over 400 cards, gets a bit fiddly and drawn out for new players, but a solid economic game.

Played seven full games and two half games. Very nice looking. The numerous hazards and game length (3 to 3.5 hours) make it a somewhat frustrating two step forward, one step back experience overall. If you can't deal with the mechanic of very bad things are going to happen to you 2/3 of the time then don't play this game. I gain some satisfaction from playing Parthenon. Yet afterwards I feel like I passed through a gauntlet/ordeal and barely survived. Winning just means you had a one or two fewer major wounds than your opponents. The word "fun" seldom comes to mind. So I can only take it about once every 9 to 12 months.

Not so complex, but too long and with too many thingies to look after to be considered gateway. Some of the cards could be replaced with chits or something for clarity, although the artwork is quite nice.
This is essentially a game of risk management, where you should be watching the progress of other players as to decide what to do. It plays differently each time, and variability is also ensured through different island characteristics. 
With increased play, I may find this game too long and fiddly for what it is - but on the other hand, it may flow quite quickly once players get experienced. Time will tell.

Odd one for me to rate.  Had a good time playing the first time, but I'm not sure about repeated play.  The second game reinforced my feelings on the first play.  There are LOTS of cards, but many are not useful, and I would have expected some more variety among the players.  Did not like the 'everything produces each round', at all.  It made the trading to standard.  Hard to catch a leader, since the events are probably canceled as he has the most buildings, not trading with him mitigated by his multiple abilities from buildings.  Like the Archon vote.  Great artwork.  Some new avenues to explore, but building village basic buildings so fast, and the timeline does not feel right: building 2 World Wonders in less than 3 years?  Those ancients moved FAST.  My rating could go either way as I think more on it.

Long playtime (it took us 3.5 hours with the rules, although this could probably be cut down to 1.5/2hrs once we know the game). The random events are, well, random. They can make or break your game, and while you can sort of do something about the pirates, it's very hard to avoid the storms (you need a shrine and a rare, but before you get there you need six basic commodities, and to get that you need...). In the end you can loose the game even though you made no bad moves. I guess that the Archon there to help the loosing player catch-up, but it's more of a patch than anything.
I did like the 'market' concept where some goods were more valuable than others, but again this is all random and a little unwieldy; if wheat is in shortage in Athens, the player who produces wheat will cash in a fortune and all the other players get the shaft, even though players don't actually get to select what ressources they build. So in that case the wheat player gets a major boost, but just because he was lucky. Meh.

I could see myself sort of enjoying the 'short' game (play the last two years only), which is why my rating is so high.

Card-based Mediterranean trading game.  Introduced as a game focusing on risk management.  Interesting that the board aspect was downplayed in favour of cards, although it made it a bit more difficult to quickly see other opponents' status.  Since inter-player commodity trading plays such a huge role, it's important to get in that "first" trade from a player who produces that commodity (as well as potentially make use of newer players' naivety).

Steve Quade told me he liked this one and we never had a chance to try it. Ever since then I've been interested in it.

EDIT: I finally tried it and felt it was a little too long for the game expeience it delivers. Also, lots of luck... But I would still give it another shot, I guess.

EDIT 2: Sold it for 20 euros.

I gave this to my wife for Christmas (06), but we haven't had a chance to play it yet.One thing does puzzle me about the game; maybe I've got my wargamer hat on while reading the rules, but why didn't Z-Man games just use chits and a board to identify the different items that an island has (different villages, etc)?  It would seem to make more sense and make the game a bit more compact.

Aside from that, the rules seem very straightforward and look like the game will be fun to play.

(EDIT: Aug 22, 2007): After having played a two player version for a bit with my wife, we've come to the definite conclusion that we're replacing some of the cards with glass beads.  While I don't normally mind cards very much; there's just too many to use a regular game board effectively.  Outside of that, it's fairly straightforward and emphasizes cooperation and risk/reward.

Enjoyed my first game of this, with five players all new. However, this is an unforgiving game that will bug first-time players who may think it's too "random". Really, it's a game that punishes the unprepared player who ventures out to trade with a fully loaded boat and not enough Aegis cards to protect their investment.

This game was ok.  It just felt like everything that happened was very negative. Most of your shipments have items destroyed.  All of the events are bad.  Then there are hazards.  The events are hazards!  The Great Wonders seem to be weak and cause you to pay dearly for them.  Played with 4.  Not a terrible game, but felt like a headache as I was getting punch every turn by the games events.

I liked this game quite a bit at first, but now I've seen too many instances of one player escaping the hose time after time while everybody else gets screwed.  Smart trading and diplomacy will only take you so far;  the hazard cards are really what determine who wins and who doesn't.  When you can only load up to six cards on a ship, and you are routinely forced to discard half of them or more, the game becomes much more of a luckfest than it pretends to be.

For those who like to trade cards and build . . . .  I liked the game, but found it lacking in strategic depth.  The winning strategy is build, build, build.  Of course, one must realize that you develop productive capacity first, and then focus on production - a simple comcept for more serious gamers.  That said, there are tactics to deploy (i.e. who to dead end) and there is also some social engineering to the game (i.e. never say you're winning) but other than a few obvious themes, there doesn't seem to be too much depth.  Also, I feel the games event cards are little too despositive of who will win in a three player game (of course, that is stategy, and may be something one can account for in follow up plays, but this kind of thing draws a line between the experienced and non expirienced players).

Cool game. Feels a bit chaotic at times, but if you know how to cover yourself, you can usually keep damage low. You need to be building at all times if you hope to build everything. Use of shortages and surpluses is important. You should ALWAYS have the events in mind when planning for your next turn. If you can hold onto resources and build on your next turn, you probably should, unless the game is close to an end. For GOD SAKES don't forget use your special abilities!!! Requires alot of table space. Getting a useless or difficult to build Wonder Plans can really cause you trouble.

Updated my rating. After a few plays this game seems more like an exercise in masochism. Nobody is getting through this game unscathed, and you usually get hit when you are depending on a trade round most. With a limited number of turns, you can't afford to lose any. Trouble is you'll always lose some, and they will be the largest shipments by design. I supposed there is a certain amount of hedging your bets to do, but even that's not enough.

There's a good game in here, but it's being kept from coming out by some odd play balance issues.  Mostly these have to do with the potentially punishing Hazard cards, since they're the hardest thing to try and mitigate while still moving forward rapidly with development.  Losing a single fleet of 4 or more cards will almost certainly mean game over.

There must be a way to fix what's ailing here, but it may not be worth the effort.

"Civilization Lite" - embodies the nature of the classic without the massive time investment. I prefer to think of the mechanics of this game to be based on risk management instead of calling it a luck based game.

Great components, great theme, pick up and deliver mechanics are always appealing. But you do all the work where the game is appealing and then just walk into luck minefields. You can mitigate and insure against it, but the cost seems so high that you'll just lose to whoever doesn't and gets lucky. Which might as well be you. Until it isn't. Too long for the luck ratio in the end.

Fun risk-management game, with lots of strategic options.  Do you want to send away your island's wealth, perhaps to return home with the riches of the ancient world, or perhaps not to return home at all?  Certainly different strategies are viable at different points in the game.  One drawback is that it's a little difficult to keep up with what everyone else is doing.

After my first game (three players) I'm wavering between a 7 and an 8.  There's a lot to like here, lots of historical flavor and good integration of theme into mechanics (better than eurogames).  There are also a variety of strategic choices.  There are a lot of potentially brutal random events (although these can be planned for to some degree).  My main criticism is the cumbersome amount of card management due to the enormous number of cards in the game.  You're constantly shifting cards around from one stack to another, and the cards take up a lot of space.  Overall I like the game, and I'm looking forward to another play.

After playing a second game, I changed my rating downward a few notches. I felt the Hazard cards and Event cards were overly powerful in a game of only twelve turns.  There were way too many times no one made port with ANY goods or ended up one or two too short due to the Hazards. So we couldn't make any good trades to get the gold to be able to pick up an Army or a Warship to mitigate the damage on the next trip. And the Event cards we drew completely wiped out our saved Commodity cards faster than we could regain them. It rapidly became an exercise in futility and killed the fun for all of us.

Players play against the game engine more than against each other. The luck factor in going to sea makes for a frustrating game (it's not so much about whether or not you gain a little or a lot, but rather whether you lose some or all of the fruits of your labor). Just not fun.

Has the resource collection and building aspects of Attica, with some risk management as well. to get the more valuable commodities you nee to go overseas with a greater risk of failure. There are ways to mitigate the risk but you have to spend resources to try to get cards that reduce the impact of bad events. 
The art and rule book are first class - it is a an approachable game. 
I think it could have a problem with replayability since the pattern of development seems to be constrained will need to play it a few more times to be certain.

A really interesting game, centering around risk management.  Take big risks, you're likely to hit trouble; take no risks, you won't get very far.  Ordinarily, winning or losing a long game on the turn of a couple of cards would be a problem, but Parthenon is just so INTERESTING to play it doesn't matter.  Not a game I'll be playing every week, but one I can see myself playing a couple of times a year for a long time.

RATING: 7
At first it seems very similar to Mare Nostrum, since you accumulate and spend resources, represented as cards, in sets with no duplicates, to build things and get the favor of the gods, and most of the resources are the same as those in Mare Nostrum. But it turns out that's about the only similarity. The trading is much freer, there is NO warfare, and there's a great deal of luck in the success or failure of your long distance voyages (to trade with non-player nations).  The starting strategy is pretty straightforward, but then the game throws curve balls with events, shortage and surplus, and special conditions, that require the players to adapt their strategies and make every game play differently.  Since I think every difference is an improvement, I like it much better than Mare Nostrum. I'm not likely to play it often, but it's well worth the time to play. There are a couple of serious flaws in particular events, however: the card that lets one player pick another player and prevent that player from accomplishing anything for the last four turns of the game has absolutely no excuse.

RATING: 2
Wow. I was waiting for a game to come along that features every mechanic I actively dislike, and this is the one. Solitaire play, repetative turn sequences, smacking the leader, loads of event text and logistics that require excessive brain burning to get a handle on, only to find the luck of the card draw puts it all down the toilet.

This is one of the few games I've played where I really had to push myself to finish it - and I only played the tournament game. By the final turn the table was completely covered by cards and I'd given up trying to worry about whose events did what. I was tired of constantly re-reading my card text and didn't even bother finishing the final turn. I should have! The other three players all finished tied for first (in Maharaja style) and then went down a twelve step tie break table - eventually finding a winner at stage eight.

The trading between players is especially tedious and just felt pointless, while the solitaire play was totally chaotic. Everyone just built and exchanged cards on their own initiative. Who knows how many "accidental" exchanges and builds went through incorrectly?

This remains one of the very few euros I just can't see myself playing again.

***After only one play***

Game appears to be horribly imbalanced / broken. I'm wondering how much play testing was done with this game. We basically stopped playing the game because it was apparent that the game was over. One player had outstanding luck while others got screwed. Won't go into details here. We're planning to try the game again during our upcoming game weekend. I'm not giving up on the game it looks to be a good game. I'm encouraged by players saying good things after more plays. My feeling at the moment is the game has a really big luck factor, is very slow to start, and is impossible to catch up if you get behind due to luck. Will update the score once I play again.

RATING: 6
Parthenon is fun, and has a number of good qualities including excellent artwork, nice balance, good theme, a well-tuned development arc, and a well-written rulebook.

On the down side: I think luck plays too large a part in this game. A bad shuffle, even late in the game, can ruin a couple of hours of careful work. Significant choices seem a bit limited, and often the decisions are fairly obvious. The game also seems to run a bit long for what it offers.

If you like the theme and don't mind a luck-heavy Eurogame, Parthenon is a good choice.

For myself: With the gameplay feeling a bit constrained and luck looming so large, I can't quite rate Parthenon a 7. It's close -- I rarely give fractional ratings, but if I did this might be a 6.5. If further plays improve my opinion (there might be strategic choices I don't see yet) I might raise my rating. But at the moment, it's unlikely to see the table again soon, because there are too many games I like better.

RATING: 4
A good concept that could be a great game if a few tweaks are made.

Art: Have the commodity symbols are little larger and/or have the player's island card or the phase reference card list ALL the commodities. (what was that 6th commodity I'm looking for?)

Events: Other than the Temple of Zuess (IIRC) there is no way to get rid of events cards. A rule allowing an "Aegian League" where all players sacrafice a rare and a basic during the events phase can eleminate an event card.

Hazards: 50% "safe journey" is good, but a card with a less harsh whammy needs to be mixed in like a goods spoilage; all ships lose one card, not effected by lighthouse or stoicism. (no one wants to buy the spoiled good at the port)

Journeys: Have the journies to foreign lands have their own draw for hazards. (how could a storm over Italy effect a journy to Egypt yet not effect the Aegian?)

Another civilization game about gathering resources and making some combos to construct more and grow.  The objective is to be the first completely built city.  The emphasis of the game this time is focused in the trading part of it.  Players can exchange resources among them, but then also can make trips to foreing lands to do so.  The longer the voyage, the more dangerous it is.  For some, this aspect of the game is a lottery, and sure it is, but in fun way.  Besides, there are some ways to manage risk and the game is long enough for every player to suffer equally the hits of the gods of Fortune.

The game that lauched a thousand cards. Well, it was almost good.  What happened?  Why design a game with this much intricacy only to throw some wacky cards to throw everything for a loop? I like the Civ style trading system, and the building up of your little kingdom is fun (although the building cards are excessive and the game may have been better benifited by having a more functional play aid.). Sadly, it is never worth it to ship goods to trade.  I don't mind a little risk management, but the randomness of the cards mitigates any probability.  In order to make the most of shipping goods you need 4 cards.  If you run into pirates they are going to make your shipping useless unless you create a buffer, all it takes is to run you below 4 cards, there are cards that take away a certain number of cards so you can mitigate them by overloading, but there are pirates that only attack those that are shipping the most goods, so you can't lower your efficiency for safety.  What it comes down to is pure luck.  That means many wasted turns, and by many, I mean most. Shipping just sucks the fun from the game.  I decided early that I just wasn't going to ship.  Unfortunatly, someone needs to ship to get gold.  This is the big threshold in the game, and a hurdle that is tough to cross.  

I decided instead of wasting turns hoping to do something and failing, I'd just wait for people to get gold later in the game and piddle around in the meantime.  Frustrating or boring you make the choice.  I won but it took a couple turns because even though I was clearly in the lead, a random card prevented me from putting us out of our misery and I had to find someone to give me a spice card (which I randomly needed yet didn't produce).  If they hadn't I'd have to be lucky enough not to fail shipping after shipping until the end of the game.  Never again.

Terrific game. I find that in spite of its somewhat daunting and elaborate mechanics, in actual play, it's a lot of fun. The game puts players in the position of sharing both misery and joy during its "Journey" phase, so that a certain camaraderie in the face of both is inevitable. While it is indeed one of those games with a lengthy learning curve, even raw recruits can get into the spirit of the thing rather quickly. It both demands and rewards repeated plays. I would almost never pass up an opportunity to play this, with veterans or newcomers.

I love the theme of this.  (Strangely, for years I wanted to design an ancient Greece game that had some of the same elements--buildings, philosophies, etc.)  The exploration is a bit chaotic, though.  I need to play this again to get a good feel for how much I like it.

Tons of cards and a combo of Settlers and Civ.  Many either love or hate it, with some really despising the randomness of the hazard cards.  Would really like to try it.

At first it seems a good game with a building engine very interesting especially because (I admit) I like the theme.
Everything has to do with cards, everything works with cards - buildings, materials, events... everything. That is a bit dull. Plus the productive phase is a bit annoying because it is a bit fiddly. 

After a few turns I've realized that the result of the game is ruined because of the exaggerated randomness that decides the game. It's quiet stupid actually to play this game when everything a player can decide towards his strategy can result in absolutely nothing because of a random card. 

In the end, this could have been a good game but it resulted in a bad one mainly because it has stupid mechanics that ruin the experience.

In my one and only play, I got battered in the midgame, but eventually the hazard deck evened out. Buying a second ship and spilting my risk with local and long distance travel really helped. By the end, I saw that it was possible to protect myself better against the harshness of the event deck and the hazard cards. I'm looking forward to playing again.

Fun trading and journeying, but it is really long, and you can spend a long time just getting hosed by the deck.  It doesn't seem like the game is worth the time investment.  I would prefer a lot more meat if I were to spend 4 hours (120 minutes?  What a joke).  I'd try it again, but I'm not really itching to do so.

beautifully illustrated & exquisitely designed.  its over 400 cards are surprisingly manageable and provide lots of variation from game to game.  will appeal more to those who like "fiddly" games and who don't like direct conflict.  my favourite civilization game so far.

In my group we call it "The Game of Pain." And, there's a lot of luck - it seems once everyone gets the basics down, who wins = who's luckiest. Still, I get a hankerin' to play it every now and then; there's something fun about the havoc, I guess.

UPDATE:
After winning 5 times in a row I am starting to think there's more than just luck here. Still, bad luck can indeed take a player out of the game potentially.

I like it a little less every time I play. It's a risk management game with a lot of flavour, but the luck factor, the random events, the "take that" effects are just too many.
If you're not scared by random events in a game, anyway, you can give it a try, since the game engine is good.

I've just played a solo game so far, to get the hang of it, but I definitely enjoyed the game.  I see complaints about seasonal event cards being too harsh, but if a dice roll was put in place each season to see if an event occurred I could see that hurdle minimized (maybe with favorable odds during "summer sailing" months, and with unfavorable odds during the "winter sailing" months - after all, Greeks were smart enough to not risk long distance travel during certain times of year).

The components of the game are top notch (I really like the art). This is a game of trading and risk management. It is long game because of trading and all the different choices you have to make. It is a very good and well designed game. But it will take 2-3 hours to complete a game. Very enjoyable game if you like risk management games (there are not many risk management games out there). It is a very well balanced game if you know what is risk management.

I can't believe this game was 3 (or 6) years in the making according to the box.  I would be embarrassed to have my name listed as a playtester.  Where do you start in panning this game?  The completely random cards that can basically screw every player besides the start player or the completely random cards that can cause you to lose turn after turn.  Not really sure why I'm not rating this a 1...

Parthenon's game play is best described as -- tedious. It is true that luck of the draw plays a huge role in the outcome of the game. The hazards are devasting to a player if a string of unlucky cards are drawn. Furthermore, the amount of cards used in this game is a little heavy. It covers the entire surface of the table and then some more. Most of all, I think the game is not well balanced due to numerous factors. The type of village production is skewed and year one strategy seems limited. Build first layer of villages, then build workshops...etc.

RATING: 8
I played this at WBC 2005. It is a very dynamic game, full of trading and risk.  The economy in this game is very dynamic because each player produces something that other players need, but what each player needs changes quite a bit depending on what they have built.  Trading is virtually required, since it would be horribly ineffective to try to avoid trading with other players.

There is also an almost adventure like travel aspect to the game.  You won't know what dangers you will face on the way, and you don't initially know what you are going to find when you get there.  The final destination might be a wasted trip or a golden opportunity.  There is a risk that the destination is good, but useless for what goods you brought on the voyage, but if you don't trade, you don't have to tell anyone what's there, which means you can come back next season.  There are also ways of protecting yourself from the dangers of travelling, but protection isn't free, and resources are always tight.  I doubt that players will often be completely safe.

Almost everything in the game happens simultaneously, which really keeps things moving all the time.  Each turn, one player is elected Archon, so If issues of play order become important, that player decides.  Of course a little pursuasion is a good idea.  This also make for a very interesting way to keep the game tight, since the weakest player is the best candidate for this position.

I played with 6 players, but it was a coached game.  I am not sure how the game works with fewer players (especially since each player was producing something that the others needed).  I am also not sure if the game is simple, or if alot of complexity was being hidden by the coaches.  On the surface, while it clearly isn't a simple game, it seems quite logical and managable.

Update: After a long time between plays, I finally got to play it again (it is hard to get 3 hour games out in my group).  This time it was with 3 players.  I expected the three player game to be very similar to the 6 player game because it would be similarly balanced, but not so much.  It might have just been becuase of the different players, but there was less incentive to trade.  In a 6 player game there is less concern about a trade that helps another player because someone else will have that same resource.  A trade that benefits you and someone else is better than a trade that benefits two completely different people.

Someone else handled the heavy lifting again, but I came away knowing that this game isn't nearly as complex at it appears.  Everything is so prograssional that things tend to make alot of sense.  We didn't have alot of questions during play.  The progrsssional nature of the game might be a problem for some people.  It makes the game fairly a scripted race, with the trading and the card draw being the only sources of deviation from the script.  Since those events are 50% bad and can hit different players very differently, the people who feel the game has too much luck have a point.  It doesn't seem to affect my enjoyment of the game though.

The event draw was another major difference that had nothing to do with the other players.  We had every bad event in the game come out.  I tended to be hit the worst by the bad luck, so I didn't get any gold for the first half of the game.  Most of the ways to protect yourself in the game require gold, so that made me even more vulnerable to the bad events.  The funny thing was that in the end, I won anyway.  Instead of re-doubling my efforts to protect myself, I concentrated on building as efficiently as possible so I wouldn't have anything to lose during the next event round.  The lack of trading stunted building growth (No wonders were completed in this game) and I got hit twice with the event that destroyed villages, but by the end I was able to restore my lost buildings and actually complete more than anyone else.

I dropped my initial rating by half a point.  It was perhaps a bit over-enthusiastic, but once again I really enjoyed the game.  The progressional building structure gives me a feeling of accomplishment as I play, and the simultaneous turns almost completely remove any downtime.

P.S.  Biggest game comment ever?

Settlers in Attika-land with some utterly random-ass Civlike calamities thrown in.  I may be a little harsh with my assesment here, but my one play left me feeling a little hollow, as if there was too much time for the amount of game in the box.  Perhaps I ought to try it again, but there are just so many better uses of one's gaming time.

Muy buen juego, su excesiva presencia de suerte se compensa con una larga duración (sin embargo, se puede ir en hora y media, incluso menos) y una posición más conservadora en las acciones.

Puede parecer más una carrera por completar sus construcciones que una juego de civilizaciones, toda vez que es poco lo que los edificios ayuda o que uno realmente pueda sacarle el juego

Puede regresar pronto a la mesa.

Only played one game, which I won, but I felt like there was too much randomness in the sea hazards and events, spending time planning and having it completely dashed by bad card draws was very very annoying. This is fine in a short game, but Parthenon is quite a long game. The board also feels small and managing all the cards is a lot of work.

I like this game, despite the randomness and chaos inherent in the card decks.  The sea movement, the uncertainty of the harbors, and the events add a neat historical feel to the game, and it rewards long-term planning.  It's frustrating to get hosed by a random draw, but it helps to capture the sense of an uncertain history.  It's just so flippin' LONG, and has an extraordinary amount of down time.  If not for those two things, I might rank the game higher, since it has such an epic feel.  But I might play it once a year.

I got hammered by the luck factor, but still had a great time with this game.  The luck factor might be a little high and might reduce my rating of this later, but so far, I think it is a great game.

Second Playing:  Yup - managed the luck factor better and won this time.  It's a game in which you will most likely have bad things happen - you just have to manage them.  You could consider this luck, or just needing to plan for the worst.  I really like this one.

Played once (with 4 players). I had reasonably high expectations for this game (despite the warnings about the influence of luck in a rather long game) and wanted to like it for many reasons. I was, however, sorely disappointed. 
It is true, the luck is there, and can ruin the plans of a player for a turn (and then, being fickle as it is, it can ruin the plans of the same player again on the following turn). It takes several forms: event cards (although since there are few of them, you can probably try and guess and avoid being struck too much by them), hazard cards, harbour status. The hazard cards can only be negative or neutral, but the other ones can either be deadly (at least for one turn) or give an unexpected boost to someone. I would not mind some randomness, but it hurts in a game that long (more than two hours - however, we were all newbies), and a lower amplitude of effects would have been welcome.
Then we have what is, in my opinion, the main problem of this game: symmetry. There are 6 basic resources, but they are all (almost) the same. Sure, your island produces only 3, and there are some incentives to get different commodities. Does that introduce any tension? Not at all, because your neighbours also have 3 commodities, among which the ones you need, and they need the ones you have. A bit later in the game, everyone starts producing rare commodities, and symmetry strikes again. You produce a rare commodity (out of 3), and it is everyone's best interest to trade them between players rather than risk braving the seas to lose them to a storm or a bunch of pirates, to trade them to foreign lands where you would get a worse exchange rate anyway.
There is more symmetry in this game: everyone needs basically the same resources to build their buildings. The alternate buildings are a nice idea, since they introduce a slight differentiation between players - but they are more of the same again, and I would expect them to be often, as in the game I played, a way to escape the need for papyrus (a special rare commodity which can only be obtained in distant Egypt - which requires a long and potentially dangerous journey).
Wonders, however, break this symmetry a bit, and they even do that in two ways: their building costs vary, providing players with different goals to meet, and their effects are different too (unlike the effects of the "normal" Acropolis buildings, which are the same for every player). Since you cannot choose which wonder you are going to build, however, you are stuck with the plans you got, and have to hope they aren't too costly - even though it means, as it should be, that your completed wonder will have limited effects.
So, what do we have overall? A race game (since the goal is to complete the full set of buildings on your island) where most components can be obtained by trade, and the other ones by short trips to Athens and the neighbouring areas (assuming you use an alternated building to disregard the need for Egyptian papyrus). Risk-taking is unrewarding at best and severely punished at worst.
Another part of the game which I haven't mentioned is the academies and their philosophies. They look like a nice idea, but I haven't seen them in use in my play.
A final word about the components. The rulebook is very clear, which is a good point, and the cards are very nicely illustrated. However, I suspect it would have been more convenient to use something else (markers or small tiles on a player mat?) to represent buildings.
I wanted to like this game - I really did (and the fact I spent half an hour writing this comment might be a further proof). However, I am afraid the flaws are too numerous for me to play it again.

Based on only one GenCon play, this game's got a lot of meat on it. I'm afraid it might suffer if you do not have 3 or 6 players, however, because each player ramps up with certain resources that other players don't have, so playing a 4- or 5-player game, some players would seem to have a slight intrinsic advantage. But if you like "get this, to do this, to trade this, to get this" games, you'll probably like Partenon. Good part: Simultaneous moves mean no downtime in moves. Neutral point: Players that think too much during trading will be left in the dust. Bad point: The game runs a little long for my short attention-span brain.

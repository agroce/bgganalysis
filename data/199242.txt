I really like this little print-and-play dungeon crawler that uses only 9 cards and taks its inspiration from roguelike computer games and RPGs. It's easy to learn, plays quickly and provides a good challenge. How much roll-playing you do is up to you...

A solitaire entry for the 9-Card 2016 Design Contest. It's a fabulous dungeon crawl with spectacular art. A gem.

I need to build and play the new edition.

Mini Rogue really surprised me. Something about the clean graphical style got me to print this one and assemble myself a copy. 

I am an old fan of Rogue-likes on the PC, and this microgame actually manages to capture that feel with a minimal amount of components! 

Thanks to Marco Arnaudo for the video that made me aware of the game! I plan to have this handy whenever I'm travelling.

I played the 1.2 9-cards PnP version.
I was drawn to this little game for its very small footprint and stripped-down material requirements. 
It took me a few attempts (even in easy mode) in order to delve down to claim Og's Blood... my first games were abruptly stopped by a few bad rolls that I could not alter. I felt the game did advance smoothly and did provide a nice experience of dungeon crawling considering the very limited quantity of material involved.
Overall, I think the game would have the potential to be a good game if it were developped in order to increase the variety of cards/monster/events/traps that compose the dungeon. The mechanics are there and quite refined. Graphics are flat but appealling, which I feel is a plus as I was disgusted by the overly naïve art of other dungeon crawler/rogue games I considered trying. As of now, I feel a bit frustrated and dulled by the repetition of the same 6 dungeon cards over and over again. I would like more of the same !
I hear a KS campaign might be on its way with an extended version of the game, which could be a blessing if done right.

This is a neat game. It provides a summary of dungeon crawling experience. Alas, it does not create the story I am looking for in dungeon crawlers as it is highly abstracted. Game mechanics gets 8 from me, but the story it creates which is what I am always looking for in a game falls flat. So 5.5 it is for me.

I've played the casual difficulty and have made it to level 5, and this is a great game for quick dungeon delving.
I can't believe that 7 cards and some dice can go so far, but it really does.

I love those solo board games(or solitaires) and this one was designed to be played by only one player. That's cool.  Also, I like randomness of the roguelike RPG too, so it's a perfect game to me. But it's not really original nor innovative, that's why I decided to reduce 2 point.

RATING: 5
This manages to give somewhat of a dungeon crawl feel despite its small footprint via the leveling up and the buying of items. However, it can also be very swingy, with one bad roll against a monster can be the difference between everything being okay to death, unless you do well enough early on to accumulate a lot of health/items as a buffer. Also, decisions are fairly light and sometimes obvious: would I rather go into a trap that either does nothing or hurts me, or something that either does nothing or benefits me? For its length and small footprint it has its place, but don't expect to be blown away by any means.

A very good little (9 cards...that's it!) PnP Rogue-like. The art is evocative in a minimalistic fashion, and the whole package is just excellently thought through. I feel for the game to really shine the key 'variant' is a must (I'm not all that sure why it's not just included as part of the core game). That combined with Impossible difficulty and it begins to feel worthy of its Rogue-like inspired title. This one is going to be added to my 'backpack games' for those moments when I'm twiddling my thumbs and the rest of the world seem to be glued to their smart devices...

A very clever design, using only seven cards to build the dungeon and still provide a sense of variety. Difficulty seems about right: In three games on Normal I´ve won one, lost one half-way through and lost one really early. Very portable and small foot print. This is a keeper among the free PnP solo games.

Dungeon crawling distilled down to 9 cards and a handful of dice and tokens. It's a bit repetitive after a while but definitely worth printing out if you have the means.

Oh. My. Gosh. I love this game! Even though I died fairly early on in my first two plays due to terrible rolls, I could tell this would be a keeper. I'm a bit biased in my opinion because I love micro games. But this is a bit of a masterpiece, no matter how you look at it. If you like dungeon crawlers at all, you have to print and play this game.

There are only 9 cards, and all you need to add is 4 dice and 8 tokens (I made mine from polymer clay). So it's super quick to put together, and super portable.

After setting all your markers on the default starting spaces, you simply shuffle your deck, lay down the dungeon cards in a 1-2-1-2-1 pattern, and begin to walk through the rooms (cards) left to right, resolving each card as you go. You roll dice to fight monsters, determine loot and avoid traps, and move your markers accordingly. Super easy, once you get the rules down.

It's hard to believe how great a game could be created with just 9 cards, but this is a definite winner.

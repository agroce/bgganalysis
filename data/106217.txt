We really enjoy Hawaii, it's got everything Angie and I like in a game:

- It has clever and entertaining game mechanisms.
- You have lots of options every turn, so there's plenty of decision making.
- It's possible to follow strategies, but you certainly need to keep an eye on what your opponents are doing and adapt accordingly.
- It has variable setup so that no two games will be the same.
- It has a charming theme with beautiful artwork and high quality card and wooden components.
- There's player interaction, but in a resource-denial style rather than smashing up someone else's creation.
- It provides for up to 5 players but still plays well with 2.
- It wasn't overpriced!

It reminds us of Vikings and Sun, Sea & Sand, which are two other games we like a lot.


In the center of the table is the island, comprising 10 randomly arranged location tiles, on which sit a number of building, people and other stuff tiles.

The players move their chieftain figure around these locations. He travels on foot so to move him you spend the first currency in the game, little wooden feet.

On arrival you take a tile from the location and add it to the villages in your tableau. The cost is paid in the second currency of the game, little wooden shells. The cost varies from turn to turn so you need to watch for cheap prices.

Your villages may provide end-of-game points but they may also provide other general benefits, or generate feet, shells and the final currency, little wooden fruit at the end of each turn. Everyone gets a diminishing general income each turn so these supplements are very important.

Fruit can be used either as shells or as feet, but not in combination: you must fully pay using only one of the three currencies.

At the end of each turn there are a lot of points to be awarded based on who spent the most improving their villages and making the occupants happy. So you are torn between trying to get the best price for your purchases, but also trying to spend enough to qualify for those happiness points.

Very nice game :)

An excellent worker placement/resource management game.  My pick for best game of 2012.  There is a lot of direct and indirect interaction and lots of strategies and routes to victory.  BGA implementation is also really nice.

RATING: 7
Play a set number of rounds of running around collecting tiles for your village that give you benefits and/or points, using a modular board, and a relatively new/interesting payment mechanic.  Sounds very derivative and bland but it actually works very well.  Scales nicely too, so overall a real success, especially for a first-time designer.

Could have been confused for a Feld, particularly with Bora Bora following it pretty closely. I'm a big Feld fan (though often preferring his earlier designs), and so the comparison is pretty favorable, but I do think I prefer Bora Bora.

It is sort of a typical Euro in which there are various sorts of currencies that you exchange for certain actions and then those will let you somehow build your tableau or your multipliers and etc.

Alas, this one probably gets overlooked from within the lot of those sorts of games (most of those being, likely, Feld designs).

The tropical setting adds little colour to yet another pale and uninteresting euro efficiency game. Hawaii gives you three kinds of resource; feet for moving your worker around, shells for buying things and fruit that can be used for either.  The things you are buying mostly offer more resources, discounts, or vp bonuses. Throw in some Vikings-style judgments around lengthening a row of tiles or starting another one. 

Lots of choice about what to buy offers an illusion of depth, but Hawaii is pretty basic engine building and point mongering. Quite dull.

Production quality is good.  The artwork is nothing special.

I tend to look down at my nose at Euro's until I give them a try, and the same thing happened here. But once I tried it (on the island of Kauai, no less) I really fell in love. I love the variable nature of the Island and the costs, and I love how every game feels different.

So, this is pretty interesting, and tight even with two players. The price-token mechanism and accompanying feed-your-people bonuses are very very weird to me. A lot of the mechanisms are not only unthematic, but maybe anti-thematic? That makes the game pretty hard to "grok" but I think mechanically it's sound and I had fun puzzling things out.

RATING: 6
Hmmm....a worker placement game where random cost chits are drawn in each round to determine the costs of various actions/goods that you buy with resources you are given at the start of each round.  And those goods, once purchased, go back to your village tableau to give you greater capabilities and/or victory points.  It seems fairly boring to play to me, a lot of number and cost crunching each turn, to optimize your spending approaches to the board.  Meh...sort of fun.

On the other hand, I can see how a lot of people might enjoy the theme of this game, which goes to show that games with certain themes (for example, war in war games, or tropical island themes in games like this) enjoy a measure of success regardless of how so-so the game play actually is.  Yep, theme can sell games.  Gotta love playing with hula girl chits.  What?!

Korábbi ötletek plusz minimális új ötlet profi egybegyúrása a játék. Ami tetszik, az a körönkénti pontosztás mechanizmusa, és a hátlapok (dupla értéken történő) megvételi lehetősége. És a kivitel is szép. Úgy harangozták be nekem, hogy "van egy faék egyszerűségű nyerő stratégia". Ma is felbukkant egy faék szintű stratégia, amivel 0 gondolkodással szerintem minden második parti nyerhető. Ez azért nem egy nagy pozitívum... Szívesen játszom még vele, de mégse az a "rögtön rohanok megvenni" típusú játék.

Very nice and beautiful game, with fantastic "feeples".  Moving through the island (with "feeples") allow you to buy tiles (kind of buildings) paying with shells, if you arrive early enough.  Your buildings provide more and more...  The board changes in every game, so it may be really different.  Very good production.
In my opinion, game with 5 players is too tight, resources are so scarce that it is difficult to get them, and final round can be somehow nonsense.

Wow, this game is so cool!
It's a medium weight euro, with a different set up every time. It feels like the love child of Vikings and Stone Age, but Hawaii is better than both (and I like both games!).
The gameplay is fast (just 5 rounds, with very few actions per round), but there is lots of meaningful choices: players need to boost their stash of the three currencies, enlarge their villages (and/or found more of them), go fishing or exploring new islands...
Everything is well developed, the rules are well written and the components are very good quality...
(The only drawback, if I must name one, is the fiddly set up... but if one bags everything, that won't take more than a few minutes.)
Hawaii is the eurogamer's paradise!

Okay - thumbs up here. Played 3 games so far - 3,4,4 player combinations. Had a great fruit/hula/# tiles village strategy that cranked out serious points. Another strategy to acquire all of the Kahuna's first backfired when I only filled out two villages - ahem. Very little usage of the long boats to get to the islands - don't know if that's a symptom of what showed up in the initial draws, or just the cost factor of getting the boats and then getting to the islands. Like the multiple choices.

RATING: 7
First Play: 

This game is summed up by, 'it should be, but it isn't'. The rules to the game are straightforward, the rule book should be clear and concise, but it isn't. The rule book is written in a very quirky style. The structure does come across logically and the process of checking a rule mid game was tortuous. The answers are not readily to hand and they should be. The examples by default answer questions that only experienced gamers would ask. For examples, each new row must start with a hut. Try to find that rule clearly explained.

The tile iconography should be clear in a language independant game should be obvious, but it isn't. Each player needs an index (last 4 pages of the rules). Some symbols are baffling.

This is not a deep or complex game. However after a first read I had no idea what the game was about, it is incredibly abstract.

Once the game started the need for an engine is obvious, spend a few turns creating a foot, shell and fruit supply and means of converting or subsidising moves and then mid game start to churn the points. Get the God that makes travel cheap early on and you are onto a winner.

The village build is very similar to Wikkinger (Vikings). Actually its near identical.

I don't usually care about theme and its just as well, game end did I feel I had been immersed into Pacific island life? No. This theme isn't pasted on, its just paste.

I'm being harsh, this isn't a bad game, its just not that........special. It establishes a new landmark for me as a gamer, a score of 7 is no longer good enough to justify a place in my collection. Too fiddly too abstract, too predictable, too, I've seen it all before.

Deeper than it looks with it's island theme. Many decisions to make in how you will spend your resources and what strategy to take on. Much like a worker placement game in that someone can take the action you really need to take. Sometimes it will be available for another player and sometimes the option won't be available at all. A nice blend of strategy and tactics in this one.

Worker move & Collect euro  - with multiple paths for victory.

I'm sure lots of people will love this. Variable setup, variable appearance of gods and the minor islands to help replayability.

Different routes to victory, although I think you need to build an 'economy' of some sort (as the amount of shells and feet you get rapidly diminishes and the target number to hit each round goes up).

Not my sort of game - too dry, too abstract, no real sense of narrative. Why do Hula girls give you VPs for the number of things you have in your 'line' of huts? Who knows - it's just the way you score vps dude.

Was described to me as stone age meets vikings - but it isn't really. The way your 'island' develops is a bit like vikings, but there isn't the auction wheel. And I'd much rather play Vikings or Stone Age than this.

I'd play it if pushed - but no desire to own it at all.

I love this game as much as Tom Vassel hates it.  Yes, another soulless Euro.  And one my significant other does not seem overly enamored with, sadly.  But after many plays on Yucata, across all player counts, I'm convinced this is a great game.  I've seen wins based on many different strategies, and also on mixed strategies.  Yes, the theme to this one is pasted on, so why is it so good?  The main innovation here is the action pricing.  There are 10 types of tiles you acquire for your village, and the prices to acquire them fluctuate over the course of the game.  Furthermore, not only does the price flux, but so does the number of available spaces that allow one to purchase the tile.  Some turns, you'll have 3 bites at the apple, some you'll have none.  Of course you might dislike getting shut out of what you need apropos of nothing, but really this is what makes the game shine.  You need to have contingency plans in place, as the times you can count on getting the tile you need (at the price you can afford) are rare.  This competition against the game itself is what makes it great, and what allows it to scale fairly well, as the uncertain pricing remains in the 2er even if you'll theoretically have more access to the tiles (it's kind of false, as you still need to be able to afford what you want).  The game has three types of currency, which, while not an innovation per se, certainly makes the game more involved.  (In general, these days I'm really digging games that use multiple currencies as a way to tighten up access to actions).

In many ways Hawaii looks like a nice, happy little Euro along the lines of Stone Age - I've heard talk that it should have been a shoe-in for the KSdJ.  For my money, though, Hawaii is a tougher, meaner game than that.  While it looks like an innocuous, soulless Euro, hidden in the depths of all that cardboard is a mean, tight little game with tactical action that can cut you up.

RATING: 5
I played Hawaii for the first time on Monday, and I must say that found it considerably more enjoyable than I had expected.  The early buzz on the game was that it was just another generic Eurogame, with nothing either novel or challenging to recommend it.  Additionally, the game had been frequently compared to Vikings (though mostly obliquely), a game whose great reputation still baffles me.  My enthusiasm for Hawaii was low, and I was anticipating a game similar to 2010's Egizia (which I also diskliked).

At its core, Hawaii is just another infrastructure/VP tipping-point game.  Here, you use your starting resources to purchase infrastructure upgrades, which provide either additional resources that you use to purchase VPs or which make your subsequent VP purchases more efficient.  Particularly when paired with fixed endings, these sorts of games don't hold a lot of interest for me.  

Two features of the session made Hawaii surprisingly tolerable:

(1) Players' purchases of infratructure upgrades or VPs are constrained by spatial movement capabilities.  Although, on the one hand, this is just another resource to manage, it provides an additional tension in the selection and effectuation of a VP-producing strategy. 

(2) We played with five players, resulting in an incredibly tight game.  Although others at the table found the game too tight, with too much inadvertant screwage, I don't think I would want to play the game with any fewer players, honestly.  [u]I don't enjoy games where players get to do lots of stuff.[/u]  With five players, Hawaii does not provide that sense of abundance that turns me off of so many resource-management Eurogames.  

So, all-in-all, a slightly better than average game, which is far more than I expected going into the session.  I'd be happy to play it again, I suppose, but I won't be seeking it out.

Great game this one. Plenty of options. Trying to get cheap tiles for your island but also trying to get points at every round for more expensive tiles while working on a strategy for scoring at the game end. Loved it. Hoping to pick up an English version if it comes out. 1 Play.

Eh your typical modern euro where you start the game buying resource generation and finish the game buying victory points.

The tension in this game, and why it is supposed to be worth playing, is that at the beginning of each of the five rounds, you need to figure out how to most efficiently spend your two resources to get what you want but there are limited quantities of everything, so if you don't buy them first they may be more expensive if you didn't buy them early enough in the round, or not available at all.

RATING: 7.8
Elegant, simple (2.89 weight is a little misleading) and the point to point island movement (paid in feet) is fun and plays strong to the theme. The game is well balanced and the little bit of a fiddly set-up at the beginning and between rounds is rather enjoyable (setting market prices). This one is right up there with Stone Age as one of my favorite gateway games to introduce to those looking for the next level in gaming. The book boasts 11 million possible setups for the 10 different tiles and this makes for a different strategy each time. My only complaint would be lack of end game scoring because there are not many points (outside the kahunas and god tiles) to be had in the end. An expansion would be welcomed to this classic. So, put on your Hawaiian shirt, grab a Pina Colada, turn up the island music and have a great time...this is a good one.

Has a nice theme with a good use of worker placement. Lots of different routes to victory through your board. Has good replay value with the setup being different every time. It is a pain to setup however. An average worker placement game nothing too exciting, maybe after more plays I may like it more, as of right now it's ok.

A charming, though not spectacular medium length game. Hawaii blends the genres of tile-laying, economic snowballs, and tactical worker movement into an enjoyable, middle of the road blend.

In short, players each have a single worker who moves around the island acquiring tiles to add to their own villa. The island is made up of rectangular tiles that each have one or two types of tiles available at them. Those tiles can be buildings which can generate feet (to move around more, to grab island tiles once you have boats), shells (base currency) and limes (wild currency), gods (who give you special powers and possible end game scoring bonuses) or people, like hula dancers and kahunas who reward you for building your sub-board in a particular way.

The purchase of tiles is governed by semi-randomly divvied out price chits. Some building have up to 3 available spaces at the start of the round, some only 1. Once a player has purchased a tile from a given area of the board, they take the price chit and keep it in front of them until the end of the round where they are rewarded for having the highest, second-highest, and third-highest sum.

In practice there are seemingly a few ways to approach the game. Building up some basic infrastructure early is compulsory, as some income is guaranteed each round, but decreases as the game progresses through its 5 rounds. After that is in place, then players have a few options for how they want to score. They can build singular long rows of tiles or many smaller rows. They can also bridge out into boating and grab island chits for significant VP boosts.

Really, the game is a bit complex to explain, but pretty easy to understand in practice. In terms of play it has strategy, and indeed, you need to commit to one to score effectively, but the randomness of the price chit divvy at the start of the round can make things difficult if a needed item ends up costing 1 clam more than you were expecting. There are usually ways to compensate, but it can enter into it. The game features some...very Euro...interaction in that players can mildly interfere with each other by visiting desire locales before their opponents, thereby driving up the price for items or shutting them out entirely, but the opportunity cost is high enough that it can never be truly capricious.

In short, an enjoyable enough game that should be an hour or a shade over with experience. The strategic options seem relatively limited, so I don't see it having long legs, but worth playing.

Preliminary rating after 1 play. Very pleasant game. Everything flows pretty well, no ugly corner cases, etc. This is my kind of randomness: random setup for the round, but no randomness during the round (like Lancaster for example). I like how most points come at end-game, but you can get some as you go too. Makes it a fair bit of work to know who's really winning. But it's not very confrontational, so it's mostly people doing their own thing, but bumping into each other along the way. I'm not sure the resources need to be hidden though. Insert standard debate about hidden-trackable information here.

In this worker placement game, there's definitely some point soup being brewed.  But it tastes like pineapple and poi, so it's rather delicious.  Throw in some lovely components, and it's a good time.

In Hawaii players send out their chieftans around the island to get the items they want to bring them back to their villages, which are built out in a style similar to Vikings.  But resources are scarce as you need foot symbols to travel, and need shells to get the goods.  Another option is to sail to neighboring islands for a nice benefit, but you'll need feet to move that boat.  Each round you're also trying to spend enough to earn a round bonus.

This game is a bit overcomplicated, making it a choice that's not ideal for casual gamers, but works well for those with moderate experience.  I like it even if I don't love it - and can see a pleasant future for it at our table.

Just Another Soulless Eurogame.

Get resources, buy stuff, convert it into points. Albeit with well executed mechanisms, it suffers from a very tacked-on theme and it really reminds me of working on an Excel spreadsheet. 

If you're considering this, I suggest looking for "Vikings", from Michael Kiesling, which clearly inspired the design of Hawaii and is a much better game.

Some spatial (distance) management, some resource management, and a whole lot of "if I don't buy this now, will another player snap it up first?" The tension between spending moves efficiently by buying double-powered tiles and earning points for the end-of-round contest is very nice, particularly because buying single-powered tiles likely gets you more of them... but not twice as many, since buying more things takes longer and prices will be higher later on. 

Specialization seems to be rewarded, particularly if you find a niche which other players aren't doing much with!

Components: Tons of pieces. The wooden bits are fun, especially the feet. The tiles have nice art on them, but it's difficult to read the iconography from across the table.

Experience: The type of game that offers various ways to score, but really encourages players to specialize. Fairly solid play, but perhaps I've played too many games like this.

I think I'd enjoy this game more with repeated play. The availability and cost of the various tiles is capricious, but it keeps the game unpredictable. I like the reward scheme for picking player order. I like that there are really only two resources to manage.

Not my game. The fact that you can calculate everyone's score during the game means it's just an exercise in doing the best move at the time.

I know, many games are like that, but since you know what everyone has it's not a game to me, it's a math problem to be solved. "Player A has 15 points, Player B has 12 and I have 10. The best I can do is get 3 points for this round. That is what I do."

I agree with Tom Vasel.

Hawaii was a fun play.  The components are fantastic.  The board fits the game well, and is well done.  The goals for each round get challenging in a good way.  Clever moves are rewarded well, and scores can come from a lot of strategies.  There is competition over resources in the game, but there are always options.  The only thing i really don't like it how much setup there is at the beginning of each round.  It is probably not a big deal, but it was my frist impression.  I would definitely welcome more plays to decide for sure.

I've play tested various prototype versions of the game over the years and have always enjoyed it immensely. I love what HiG has done with the game, both in the beautiful production and the clever development changes compared to the early versions.

There's a lot going on in the game with some really tough decisions and some very interesting strategic lines of advance. One of the smart pieces of design work is the variable island layout, which makes optimal path determination fresh each game and prods your strategic choices from the inside. Working hand in hand with that is the variable cost and availability for each building type from round to round, ensuring a tense scramble to meet demands. I love also that there are widely variable and equally viable strategies to pursue. It reminds me in some respects of a Stefan Feld game, in a very good way!

Players are Hawaiian chiefs, traveling the islands, trying to build up the best collection of villages.  Players on their turn spend "feet" tokens to travel to island spaces, to purchase a building, boat, tiki or artisan.  These purchases are made using "shells". Alternatively, the chiefs can visit the beach and use their boats for fishing, or visiting the islands.  The idea is you are trying to grow lucrative villages, that will provide an economy of shells, feet, food, and victory points, over five turns.  Tight, busy game that initially feels like the kitchen sink has also been tossed in.  Hans im Glueck are the one of the best developers out there, and they have polished this into a nice, playable package that asks the player questions but doesn't overwhelm them.  Beautiful presentation, rules are okay (apart from a strange rule buried in the example of play). I was expecting another derivative Euro, and to be fair there is a bit of the old familiar feeling that you've seen it all before, but this one works well.  I enjoyed it.

A few too many layers to work as a family game, and a little too thin to work as a gamer's game, so I'm not sure where this falls.   It's a move-and-buy game, where resources and then transmuted into points in a variety of ways.   If it was more in the Stone Age range, I think it might work better.   I really liked the shell mechanic which sets prices and the limited amount of buys that are available.   The jockeying for turn order is a bit too gamey for my tastes.   Has some good ideas but I don't think it will become of a "buy" for me.  Vasel's review was right about several points, which means he must have played it.   The biggest issue that I see is that the theme is almost a total disconnect.   Little of the game actually makes sense.

The Good: Very tough decisions.  Beautiful artwork.  I really thought the mechanics worked well and it is different than any other I own.  I enjoyed the idea of spending feet to walk around the island to complete tasks.  Many paths to victory.

The Bad: Long set-up and fussy cost tile placements in between rounds: this makes the game feel a little rough.  A simple game with complicated housekeeping.

Stone Age style worker placement + Vikings style village building.  Great medium-weight euro.

Hawaii may have obtained notoriety after being publicly and brutally murdered by Tom Vasel in his video review. But many eurogamers looking for a very solid medium weight game will find much to like in Hawaii. This is especially the case if you enjoy the worker placement mechanic, which is combined here with a pleasant village building mechanic not seen in many games other than Vikings. The theme gives a pleasant, playful, thematic, and aesthetic backdrop for our pursuit of victory points, a pursuit that gives us freedom to explore multiple ways of point-scoring along a myriad of different paths - and that's what our holiday to Hawaii is really all about in the first place. Combined with a variable set-up, this makes Hawaii a rewarding game to return to, ensuring that the experience doesn't quickly feel the same. For folks in pursuit of a solid medium weight euro with beautiful components and a pleasant theme, Hawaii is hard to overlook.

A worker placement game of sorts, that feels like a more complicated version of Vikings, with a different way of setting prices on the tiles available to purchase (not quite as cool as Vikings). Money is very tight in this game. The theme is very pasted on, and there's little that feels unique about this game, but it has some solid mechanics.

I had this one on the shelf a while (9 months) but finally got to play it.  
This is a really attractive game with masses of colourful components.  Gameplay mechanism is a type of worker placement.
Looking forward to playing this again.

RATING: 7
- Rengeteg nagyon szép komponens.
- Viszonylag hosszadalmas setup.
- Érdekes (számomra) új mechanizmus. Ha van worker placement, akkor ez talán worker movement. A kívánt akciók különböző helyeken vannak a szigeten, és bizony áldozni kell rá, hogy eljuss A akcióról B akcióra. Mivel a sziget összeállítasa minden játékban más és más, ezért ez egy kicsit meg tudja bolondítani a játékot, hogy ne legyen annyira egyhangú több játék után sem.
- Rengeteg akció és pontszerzési lehetősés. Szerintem kicsit túl sok is. Talán a kevesebb több lett volna.
- Gyakorlatilag nulla tematika. Sajnos megint egy "van egy absztakt játéötletünk húzzunk rá egy tematikát" érzése van az embernek. Persze egy ilyen összetettségű játékot nem lehet absztraktnak meghagyni, mert akkor elveszne az ember a színek és számok kavalkádjában, de azért lehetett volna néhol legalább a szabályban magyarázatot adni arra, hogy miért kell elérni a falunak a tikikig, hogy pontot érjenek, vagy miért ad a táncosnő minden épület után pontot, vagy miért jó a szörfös a körvégi kiértékelésnél. Az ilyen játékokban szinte mindig van egy-két luk a tematikában, de itt szinte nem is tudok olyan akciót, amire tudnék bármilyen értelmes magyarázatot adni, hogy miért azt csinálja amit csinál.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Hawaii is a resource collection and engine building game, and for the most part it comes down to the familiar choive of VPs vs. production capabilities for cashing in more later. In other words, one among many similar games. Now, there is nothing wrong with that and Hawaii works perfectly well for what it aims to do even though one might complain that it is a tad fiddly at times. The random setup means that valuations for the different paths will likely be somewhat different in most games which helps to keep the game fresh.

There is, however, little that makes it stand out. It doesn't offer anything new, anything that you haven't seen somewhere else before. If that it not a concern, you could do a lot worse than choosing Hawaii.

Feld point salad. Kinda average.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Played once online. Bluh! Fiddly mish-mash of everything.

A game in the Feld's style - you feel like being kicked here and there and in Knizia's style - you always want to do more than you can... although in opposite to the mentioned - it completely lacks the elegance.

I'd like to try it offline.

EDIT

After getting the rules explained completely I admire the game more. It's a very tense and pleasent experience - kind of hardcore Finca mixed with Vikings or Maori. The graphics and the whole idea of 3 resources produces more tense and... it's strange but less abstract feeling to the gameplay.
I like it quite a lot. Rating jumps from 6 to 8.
There's a question if it could be just a little bit more elegant and less fiddly?

EDIT II
After playing it several times more - it's a great great game!

EDIT III
After playing it more than 10 times online rating gone down. Strategies start to be quite obvious and random factor sometimes isn't very pleasant. Additionally - if you weren't focused on everything, there (aspecially at the and) might be turns where you almost have nothing interesting to do. No-thing. I'm not really shure if it's so great right now.

RATING: 7
For whatever reason this rulebook was a real chore to get through. I'd say it was worth it though.

It's a dense game in terms of moves you can make, but still manages to feel relatively light. I've played with 2 and 3 players, and with 3 players it gets to be a bit long. I can't imagine it with 4 or 5, I can't see myself enjoying 3 hours of Hawaii. With that many players you'd be better off playing online, with the convenience of the computer doing the setup every round

The mechanics are plentiful and I like the fact that you can save up your clams for a really good round if you wish. The board changes with each game so replayability is golden. But somehow, with it being jam packed with a dozen-so paths to take, a win doesn't feel like a win, it just feels like you guessed right. And yet I still want to play it more.

Fun to build your own island.  Theme is refreshing and colorful and component quality is nice.

First the positives: the Art is cool, really evoking and refreshing, compared to many other gloomy and medieval themed games. 

The gameplay is extremely simple at heart, but the addition of a second resource to spend (feet, intended as time spent traveling) adds a level of clunkiness which does not provide any additional depth while making it a little longer and more convoluted than it could be.

It's not a bad game, it was fun, but there are dozens of action selection/resource management games which I would rather play.

I enjoy the tactical decisions in Hawaii, but the game really needs a little gremlin in the box who will sort and set up the seventeen million little pieces. My annoyance at the nuisance level exceeded my desire to play, and I sold the game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Beautiful production values, but it doesen't get me. First problem is the target group: Hawaii is a bit too convoluted for casual/family gamers. On the other hand boardgamegeeks will consider it flawed. Don't get me wrong, the game works fine but not only the theme is pasted on, all the mechanics are pasted together. It felt like the designer said "it is too short, let's add another mechanism". The game felt not whole.

 Another thing is that there are only two main strategies (play for one large village or play for many villages). The problem is that it almost doesn't pay out when a player goes for many villages (unless the cost for the prerequisites are very cheap). So we have an imbalance between those two strategies. To makes things worse, the hula dancer rewards a large village instead of many (to balance things out).

 Other complaints are the mixed scorings; some points you get every round others once at the end of the game. But there is no indication on the tiles, nor a logical rule to it. You have to look in the rules and learn it by heart.

Fiddly is also that each round you pick up the used and unused price markers, mix them and put them back on the board.
Furthermore, at the beginning of the game, the stack of available tiles hides the price markes as they are very close (for one player sitting right in front).
In addition the price/earning ratio for the ships is awkward too: first it progresses linear (one foot plus = one victory point plus), but the last one / most expensive one which cost you six feet rewards you with additional 4 victory points). It is crystal clear that this option was chosen most. Another factor for imbalance or "race for the first player".

So there is light for the components but lots of shade for mechanisms and how they are put together (and sometimes how loosely they are connected to the theme). Casual players may say "it's cool as I have to take interesting decisions". Hardcore gamers will say "those decisions are obvious, and just executing obvious decisions is bland".

If I was the editor, I would have put some additional work in it before its release. There are some nice ideas in it. Some people compare it with Stone Age or Vikings, however it's not as good as them.

I'm not an euro-guy, this is quite a clean design.

UPDATE
As usual, I've gotten to play this a lot of times in the past few months over Yucata. My rating's slightly better. I think I prefer this one over Stone Age, yet the rating's similar. I get a moderate pleasure in playing it.

While I've listed no plays, I have played this game enough online to know that - in my opinion - it stinks. 

Hawaii is a worker placement game that overstays its welcome after about 10 minutes. It is variable in its set up, but will never really feel different each time you play unless you have never played any other euro game, ever.

Hawaii brings nothing to the genre.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
After one play, it seems obvious that there are different strategies that could win this game.  There certainly are tactical elements, as everybody is fighting for limited resources each turn, both in terms of "money" (shells, feet, and fruit) and buildings (which could come out in different numbers each turn, some piles being completely unavailable).

It's cool that this game has no left-right binding for turn order problem.  The randomness is constrained, too.  Not being able to look through the order of the god tiles is a bit hokey, though; if you pick up the top one and decide you don't want it, everybody has seen the one below it, which is like looking ahead, thus breaking the rule.

Fruit + irrigation + hula girls seems like a good way to win.  The "teleport anywhere for one foot" God tile is amazing, especially if you get it early.  The huts that change 1/2 resource types to another type allow you to be efficient with your resources.

One important rule not to miss is that nobody can have two god tiles of the same type -- not just two identical god tiles in the same village, but two identical god tiles on their entire board!

RATING: 6
(11/03/12) Initial play. First impressions were that of frustration and disappointment. Yet another worker-placement game with emphasis in moving your worker all-over-the-board, collecting resources and buying buildings/things/VP, on where the board is a very large "rondel", similar to [thing=36811][/thing]. All of this in a mad dash to get your resource engine set-up, against steadily increasing threshold of "happiness" (another thing you collect or earn or convert), so that you can partake in extra "bonus" VP.

The variable board set-up is innovative, making for a different game every time, as is the player-order mechanism. It is possible to cut your turn short by passing early, and grabbing either an early spot on the turn-order OR grabbing a later spot, but earning more "happiness". At the end of each turn, the amount of "happiness" that each player collects is compared, and it if exceeds the threshold for a given turn, the first and second place players get some increasing set of VP.

The theme is convincing and amusing, the rules are somewhat clear, and the components are of very good quality--standard Rio Grande fare. However, this "yet [i]another[/i] worker-placement with a different theme" does not elicit any excitement from me. I am willing to give it another try, but for now, it is a '6'.

This is OK.  One mark against it is that in my first play another player unintentionally screwed me ... & I much prefer it when I get intentionally screwed.

Long setup & rules explanation but it seems quite replayable due to the variability.

The typical strategy of build an engine then run it in the last few rounds seems difficult to beat.

My first play of Hawaii was very frustrating, and I suspect that this will often happen to at least one player in a first game, because it's absolutely essential to realize that you must begin building your economy in the first turn, because subsequently, you will not have the resources to do that.  My second play was much more enjoyable.  Once you realize that it's about, essentially, leaving your parents and receiving fewer and fewer resources, it's a nice light game with a bunch of options to explore.  So far I'm kind of stuck on the fruit strategy. (2 plays)

Tropical Island themed worker placement points salad. Players collect sundry tiles to add to a tableau frame which reward the players in varying and interesting ways. There are a few different balanced strategies to try to win with. Production value is good. Hawaii is a relatively light game and is kind of good / not bad. We actually enjoyed it enough to want to run it back for a repeat play. Hawaii doesn't offer much to stand out in the crowd of excellent lighter middle weight worker placement games. The theme of the game is pasted on and weak, yet all the graphic design is well done and enjoyable to look at. I would like a little bit more player interaction to enjoy this game more. I would like to play it more and will keep it in my collection for now. 6.5/10

Really love the theme and visual presentation. Despite my initial concern that the game would be overly complex (so much cardboard to punch), everything is pretty intuitive after half a game. It reminds me of Princes of Florence, most obviously with its "each round has a higher threshold for scoring" mechanic, but also in that the player interaction element, while not huge, is enough to really keep me engaged with/concerned about the other players. Scales great from 2 to 5.

[b]Update:[/b] My rating for this one has really jumped around, from 7 up to 9 then back down. After eight games, my verdict is that I love the theme and production but that the game is  fiddlier than I'd like. I always get some minor rule wrong when teaching.

Very classic euro-game with no twists in the mechanics and zero connection to reality.  BUT - somehow, magically, it is interesting and it makes you _really_ want to play it.  The flow of the game is so smoooooth... ;)

A big point salad is a good description that a friend used for this game. A pretty decent little game and at a great price which wins bonus points with me. 

Basically it is another WP game, only you have just one worker that you move around with to buy stuff with and have to pay for movements. Lots of stuff up for grabs, but there is somewhat of a race to grab them as only so much is available each round. So as indicated above, basically everything you do is going to get you points one way or another (or in more than one way). 

Game moved at good pace, was a good length, luck seemed mostly in line with length but the prices could stymy you at a bad times and also made planning difficult, had interesting enough decisions with a good strategic/tactical mix, and of course had a multitude of ways to score and also a few ways to approach it I think too. Here is one of my potential hesitations though, the currencies become so tight in the last couple of rounds that I wonder if the game is scripting your strategy somewhat, ie if you don't build a bit of an engine here you won't be able to do bugger all in these rounds, so many of your actions likely [i]have[/i] to go towards building this up leaving you less flexibility to do other nifty things. You can ignore this to be sure, but you better have plan B in place and enough points already gathered, especially if opponents have engine and you don't. Being tight is good, you want to do it all and can't, but there is too tight too, this might be close or in that territory. 

Note here I've only played once, and this 'scripting' might not be an issue, but it is something that I wonder about for now I mean in the last round you only get what currency you built up, but I guess if everyone builds roughly the same level, then its still affecting everyone the same. I just still think that maybe its a little tighter than it needs to be (easy tweak), and just a little extra payout than what is there now would sure be nice and allow you more strategic flexibility, more play could show its just fine though but if not my rating will drop benefit of the doubt for now

Anyway a cute little package that should keep you engaged for an hour, very generic and soulless but you know that going in and I think the game's length is a stronger point than any of its faults (except the setup), likely best with 3, note too this might be just a touch heavy for a gateway (mid weight) but could be used depending on people

Was so excited when I got this game - from the reviews, the buzz, the rules, this game was destined to become a favourite game.

Sadly, a mish-mash of tried and well worn mechanics do not a good game make!

I normally do not rate games until more than 3 plays, but I am never playing this again with any number of players. I really do not see why it is so popular (and fully accept that it could just be me being dense!)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Solid eurogame, mostly just get some resource generators and then trade resources for a variety of point scorers. But there's a bit of a puzzle in that the point scoring stuff all scores points differently and is dependent on what else is on your board and where, so there's some challenge to making sure things line up correctly. This game isn't going to change anyone's mind about euros but it does what it does well.

Update: a year and a half later and it's just not as interesting. Maybe I'm getting to the point that I've played enough games that I'm looking for more, but this just isn't that exciting to me.

After one five-player game: One player won comfortably with several boats and surfers and the god giving points for these. I went with a feet-heavy strategy, which allowed me to visit several islands, but my lack of extra shell income really hurt me towards the end. Gameplay was a bit chaotic with five players: Going late in the round often meant most of the really good options had been taken already.

Anyway, great fun! A bit mechanical and themeless, but gameplay is very interesting and the components are fabulous!

Still only played this a handful of times but I've enjoyed it a fair amount thus far.  It plays decent enough with two players.  I'd like to play it with 3 or 4 a few more times before I really make a decision on this game.  Given luke warm reception by my group I'm not sure that I'll get that many more plays of this real soon.  That said I think I'll hold onto this title.  I think I could convice my wife to play it.  For a comparison think Stone Age with action point allowance instead of die roll and worker placement.  I'd recommend picking this up if you find it on the cheap...otherwise give it a try and see if it's your cup of tea.  See Tom Vassel's review for another opinion.

RATING: 8
Roam around the board, picking up tiles which either get you points or resources.  What makes the game work so well is the interaction of its parts.  All of the scoring opportunities are dependent on other assets you pick up, and where you place them.  Similarly, you have competing goals on where to place those assets, as there are benefits for stringing them out in a single row, other benefits for going deep, with many rows, and risks which threaten to cause you to lose lots of points if you having balanced things well.

Additionally, each turn has its own majority battle which forces another decision: how much of the stuff you buy should you supercharge - making the assets more powerful, but also crippling you in that turn's majority battle?

The game seems nicely designed to promote interaction, risk balancing, and to provide competing paths to victory.

RATING: 6
More plays have seen this drop to a 6. Games feel very similar and the constant income crunch and discrete use of feet/shells/fruits is very tiresome. Or rather the planning needed each round is very annoying. Hard to describe exactly what bothers me about it. I play the occasional game on Yucata and that is more than enough Hawaii in my life for now. 

=================================
Finally got to play this. It's a solid game lots of things to do each round and decisions to make. The 5 rounds go by pretty quickly and you feel a bit action limited especially with the crunch of decreasing income. This adds a nice tension to the game.

Definitely want to play again, it's in the realm of possibility that this is a bad 8 instead of a good 7, but I doubt it. It might be interesting at 2p.

==================================
Read the rules.
Seems like a good Euro. Lots of ways to score points, tough decisions etc... Nothing particularly new or exciting but maybe that's okay if it's good enough. Need to play it to find out.

Hawaii is on the strategic combo building side of Eurogames. There's nothing groundbreaking but it's solidly developed and delivers a smooth gaming experience with enough game to game variation to retain interest. Various strategies can be succesful with the advantage being with players that face less competition in their way. Multiple ways to implement a strategy and short-term scoring opportunities offer enough decisions on a tactical level as well.

I was hoping this would be better, but the theme is pretty boring and there's something about it that just isn't very fun. Maybe it's the scarcity of money.

Seriously, laying out all the tiles on the board and then seeding it really is a pain.

A really quick gamer's euro with different setup every time. Resource management and worker placement have been combined in a really compact way and components are top notch.

RATING: 6
Hawaii is an odd little game where you are generating feet and shells and fruit in order to build huts and tikis and sometimes go fishing. It sounds light and goofy, but it's actually a fairly unforgiving (and oh so fiddly) economic game. (With, it should be stated, a horrible rulebook. An essential rule is not actually mentioned in the rulebook, but in the stupid supplement. Guys, make a single rulebook, and put all the rules in it.)

The key is to know right away that it's an economic game, which I kind of didn't. I assumed each round would provide a low but workable number of feet and shells, and I was wrong. By the fourth round (of five) my failure to prepare for this scarcity was my undoing, and there wasn't a whole lot I could do about it. That's not the game's fault, it's mine. 

The scoring is kind of oddball and in some cases didn't make a whole lot of sense to me, as evidenced by me coming in last. (The one person who had played before was 50 points -- one entire run of the score track -- ahead of the two other players.

A worker placement game where you are trying to acquire tiles using various currencies, including shells, fruit and "feet".  The game has you increasing your village sizes to hit a minimum threshold so as not not lose points.  It is very much a Euro and not very thematic, but overall a solid game.  I did not find it boring although there are a few options which see pretty sub-optimal such as fishing.  The game is ok.  The difficulty is that in a crowded Euro field does this game set itself apart from others and I would rather play a lot of other Euros than this.  But I like this well enough.

My girlfriend and I loved this game!  Don't listen to Tom Vasel.  This is a great worker placement with some nice strategy.  I felt like it played very similar to Stone Age without the luck of the dice rolls to collect resources.

I avoided this after Tom Vassal's review, but I'm glad I did end up picking it up as it has become one of my favorites. I like that the board set up changes every game which forces you to consider the layout and change your strategy accordingly. Unlike Stone Age, a single strategy won't work every time because they layout changes. Even the price changes between rounds influences your decision making. There are multiple strategies that can work to win the game. It's not a long game and it moves along without dragging.

Very dry game, although by looking at the colors of the components, it looks like a party game.
But it isn't. Its more like a number crunching game in which you try to optimize a matrix of victory points.

Not bad, many strategies to victory, tension is high, you really need to take into account what the other players are doing since they can hinder you, but to add it to my collection it just isn't special enough. Even the bright and happy colors couldn't change my mind.

I’ve had great fun with Pantheon, the other recent bog box offering from Hans im Glück, and my single play of Hawaii also gave me hope that this publisher is back on track with their specialty: the weighty and varied 90 min game. I can’t help feeling, however, that I just lack the incentive to dig into these new games as much as they would deserve when I could play Amun-Re or Goa or El Grande instead, all games whose possibilities I have not exhausted even after many, many plays. In other words, Hans im Glück might be its own worst enemy ...

Nevertheless, there are a couple of touches to Hawaii that I found outstandingly clever: paying double on the price markers for doubled goods is turned into a very tricky decision by making the players collect the price markers themselves, too. And getting less income every round is a delicious twist, because it increases the challenge of getting the last precious tiles for a village that is geared more towards victory points than towards economy.

Those special things are not enough to make me buy the game, but I’ll very happily play again, and would recommend it anyone whose game collection is not filled to the brim with similar games.

1-1-13-4th game, things are starting to gel!  quite a heavy game, i think more so than Macao.  we like it!

12-28-12-Finally tried this out.  I sure didn't understand the scoring in this game which is why I have been doing so poorly at it on Yucata.de!  Slow-going first game with Casey.  Set up is fiddly which we didn't like.  Played again but this time taught Miles on 29th--same slow playing.  We left it set up and will give another go tomorrow.  Much heavier game than I thought it would be but I do think we'll like it once we get the tiles down.

Fun euro!  Rules are simple to grasp and the tiles are easy to memorize after a few plays (most just use good symbols so you don't really need to memorize them).  

Only played with 2 and 3, and I'm not sure how it will scale up to 5.  Seems like there would be a lot of fierce competition for huts and such.  It's probably best with 3-4.

Finally, I must note that I love the feet meeples!  So cool!

What is Tom Vasel smoking? This game is FANTASTIC! 

Pro's:

1.Gameplay: Rich and diverse. Each round, players agonize over what decisions to make. There are SO many options in this game! I absolutely love the diversity. If you want something that is super-streamlined with quick and simple decisions, then this game is not for you. If you want more of a brain-burner, where you are constantly forced to make the most efficient and productive choice (in true Euro fashion), then this IS the game for you.

2.Replayability: My wife thought that after she beat me by 17 points our second game, she had it all figured out. Big problem: the board is modular. This means that you have to adjust your strategy, sometimes slightly, and sometimes severely, every game. Brilliant! 

3.Combination of complementary mechanics: Tile-laying, worker placement and resource management work so well together. Vikings already proved this years ago. Take away the bidding mechanism found in Vikings and replace it with a cool turn order incentive mechanism, and you have a similar mix of mechanics, but certainly different enough to justify owning both. Vikings is my favorite game (largely due to my love of bidding), but Hawaii is not far behind. 

4.Components: The art is beautiful, the cardboard is of a sturdy stock, and the feet/shells/fruit meeples are ridiculous. This is up there with Belfort, Trajan, Homesteaders (2nd edition) and Alien Frontiers in terms of component quality. 

5.Fun: Did I mention that this game is fun? It's also quite thematic, considering that it's a quintessential euro. I actually feel like I'm in Hawaii. I might not feel the sand between my toes, but the plane has definitely landed.

Cons: 

1.Setup time: This is the one and only con that I have noticed thus far. It does take about 20 minutes to set up completely. I can set up and play: Jaipur, Ra: The Dice Game, or Hive (2x) in the time it takes to set up this game. I would put it on par with Trajan in terms of setup time. 

Bottom Line: If you are a fan of Eurogames, buy it NOW!

I'm a huge fan of tactical euros with variable setups and open information.  Hawaii falls squarely into this category as it has a modular board (which causes travel/foot costs of items to vary by game), random market costs (which causes the purchase/shell cost of items to vary by round), and random god and dock tile availability.  There are multiple paths to victory, and the best path varies depending on the random setup as well as the number of players.  The game plays light and fast but has decent depth.  It's a nice next step from games like Stone Age and Finca if you're looking for a non-vicious worker placement/resource management puzzle.

**********

After playing 50+ times on BGA, the game is still fresh.  It plays well with 2-4 players and the relative value of the different tiles varies quite a bit by player count.  There are more paths to victory than I had originally thought, some of which I didn't discover for many games.  In a recent 4-player game, I scored 100+ of my 140 points from just end of turn and spear scoring.  I did this by getting the god that allows you to move for 1 foot, and getting 5 points worth of spear huts and an exchange hut.  I was impressed that it was possible to win without buying a single boat and having very little resource generation.

**********

The two-player game is perfection.  There is a bit of dirtiness with action denial and the paths to victory seem well balanced.

In higher player count games, especially with four, the spear hut and boat/surfer god strategies can pay huge dividends.  That particular god especially I think might be overpowered at that player count because overall scores are lower and a greater percentage of your final score will come from end of round scoring and buying from the islands.  Hence, you will naturally want some surfers and a second boat anyway.  Might as well get 4 points each from them while you're at it.

Overall, I'd rate it a 10 with two players, 9 with three players and 8 with four players.

Based on one play:

Pretty game with lots of components.  The names of the different peices match the theme quite well.

Setup is somewhat fiddly due to the large number of components.  

Lots of paths to explore and I am hopefuly many routes are all viable.

Surfers seem somewhat weak based on this play.  I think they would be much more valuable if the total added to your fishing and turtle shell values.

One of the players picked up two spear huts and received a crazy amount of VP's with them.  I wonder if the spear huts are perhaps too good.  Especially as their are LOTS of spear shells available every round.

The game was fun, however a bit long with five first run through.  Definitely willing to play again though.  I wish their was something really unique/special about the game that would carry it above the others.  So many games seem similar lately... resource management and worker placement...

Here's another Eurogame that's enjoyable to play.

Pro: high 'passive interactive' factor. Replayability seems ok. Variety in choices, doesn't feel scripted like a lot of Euro's do.

Con: like most Euro's, action mechanisms are so much more important than the actual theme.

All in all: quite an ok game. I wonder how it will hold up.

(updated 02/22/2013) Rules clarification.
After the scoring, the supply manager distributes new shells, feet, and fruits to the players.
• How many each player gets is shown on the round indicator. The round indicator depicts a man carrying a shell and a foot, each with a number. That is how many shells and feet the supply manager gives to each player. In addition, he gives players extra shells and/or feet when they have special place tiles that award them extras at the end of the round.

The rules, as written, are a bit confusing and could use a re-write. The game mechanics could use some tweaking as well.

Worker placement where movement on the board is paid for with feet, tiles are paid for using shells and the tiles are used to build each player's villages. Fish which helps end round scoring requirements and special tiles on the beach can also be purchased but feet must be used and you need boats large enough to gather them. Additionally fruit is used as a wildcard resource. 

What I like is the large number of ways to score, and the competition for the tiles. The villages are reminiscent of those in [thing=27173][/thing] except you don't have to deal with attacks and feeding -- they're just for scoring. Also, there are a number of God shrines that provide extra resources/scoring and players can flip each tile at the time of purchasing, pay twice as much and usually receive twice the benefit.

Rating after two plays: Almost no moments of tension. 
Quite abstract ways to get (lots of) points, in the end. It's, of course, not the only eurogame which works like that. This fact makes the game even worse. 

Very obvious, very unbalanced starting positioning.

While my disdain for this title didn't manifest itself in any trashing of the game (literal or otherwise) I just found myself utterly unimpressed and borderline aggravated with the concept of having to count how many little feet I was going to need to do each action and how many little shells I would need for each little tile I put on my little board.  I decided to go back to this game's ancestor, [b][GameID=27173][/b], and sell of this one.

Very tactical worker placement game where there are a bunch of ways to get points as you build a village, and the best way to get points depends on both the setup of the board at the start of the game, the re-setup of the board at the start of each round, and what your co-players are doing.  So, long story short, it's a highly tactical worker placement game.  I love it.

Jesus... Yet [i]another[/i] resource conversion game where you get tiles that give you more resources and/or victory points. The main mechanism here is once again worker placement, and you've got a tableau where you collect the stuff you get and get some bonuses for arranging everything in the right way. There's still nothing that tops Agricola with this formula, and this game doesn't even come close. Nothing brings the tension here the way feeding your people does in Agricola, and replayability is limited without cards. As with most of these games, it seems "strategic" in retrospect ("I should have gone for the boats like he did.") but it's really all tactical (Boats were only worth it because I got the super bonus tile for boats cheaply early in the game and nobody else went for it either.). Whatever. It's not horrible, and I guess I'd play again, preferably with fewer players (Five took forever.), but I won't be requesting it ever.

By the way, the comparisons with Vikings are [i]ridiculous[/i]! If Agricola replaced the player tableau with an L-shaped border and tiles for fields, fenced fields, fields with stables, etc., would that suddenly be "like" Vikings (or vice versa)? There's no auction or vertical interaction of tiles in the tableau here. Completely different games.

Hawaii tries to combine worker placement with a spatial element, where you manage not only money to buy resources but also movement points to move between resources. Still, the game is a big point salad (poke bowl?) where the sense of progression between turns is insignificant.

In Hawaii, players spend feet tokens to move around, and shell tokens to pay for goods. The board configuration is different each game, with 10 rectangular pieces distributed into 4 rows. It costs feet to move from one row to the next. Price tokens are put on the rectangular pieces and represent the price you have to play. You have the option to  pay double to get the back side of the tile, which gives better value. The round ends when everyone returns to the beach. Then the price tokens you collect are compared with your opponents and the game board. If you have the most, and meet the minimum of the game board, there is a mjority bonus for first and second, plus those who met the minimum.

Fruits give you flexibility to feet and shells, while the huts give VPs. However, whether you want to build one village or multiple villages depends on your strategy.  There is so much going on here with different strategic paths. There is a ton of tension as you do not want to leave tiles for your opponents, yet there could be so many tiles that you want.

It seems like I completely missed this game when it was released. I enjoy this game, with the tough decisions and whether or not an oppponent will take a tile you want.

A relatively light Euro that offers a little bit of engine building and worker placement with limited rules and a short time commitment. Variable board set up has a significant impact on the flow of the game. The game doesn't scale much with player count meaning 4 player games feel really tight compared to 2 or 3 player games. Would rate even higher but it feels like it just lacks a bit of depth.

With the various amount of resources (feet, sand dollars, and fruits) you take your pawns along the island of Hawaii and pick up different buildings to bring back to your town.  There are TONS of different buildings to choose from and each one has their own scoring mechanism, which is why I believe quite a few people think this a spreadsheet of a game.  

I found it fun, although a bit confusing to form a strategy because of all the various buildings, but fun nonetheless.  Considering I do not play with min-max type people we ALL have the same chance to win and I had fun playing this spreadsheet.

RATING: 8
A lot of stuff to get through in the explanation, but it pays off in the multitude of paths to amassing VPs. In a 5er, each player seemed to have a different combination of strategies; if you like that kind of modularity, Hawaii's a winner. What ties it together is competition for the limited number of spots. What might be unfortunate is that the effectiveness of one's strategy depends in no small part to the randomization of prices each round; get lucky and your particular strategy will be cheap; unlucky and you'll have to pursue Plan B. Still, as a maximization exercise/activity, a game can be enjoyed as a personal challenge, regardless of final placement.

RATING: 5
Wow.  Hawaii is the very definition of a middle-of-the-road Euro, squeaking out at just beyond Notre Dame for me in terms of "willing to play this again"-ness.

Too many choices, not enough time.  Two dominant strategies in the game, and min-maxing on both paths in order to get there.  The interactivity is mild, but at least present.

Long story short, if you like Agricola, you'll probably like Hawaii.  If you don't, you probably won't.  Me, I'm getting tired of generic VP-fests, and Hawaii is about as generic as they come.

RATING: 7
It's a medium euro with an artificial theme. It has a modular board, worker placement with action point movement and set collection mechanics. The rules are difficult to grasp, because the rulebook is not really good, there are plenty of things to consider and its abstract nature doesn't help at all.

4 players games are chaotic. You might advance what your rivals will be doing, but it's hard to guess all their moves and it's not easy to plan ahead. At the end, most of times you just do the best available move at the moment.

2 players games are more strategic, it's easier to predict what your rival will do and even if you fail, he can only take one option per turn away from you. 

Some tiles are related to others, that means even if it's true that there are some preset ways fo maximizing score, there's always alternative options. This is key for a good game.

I found the game interesting, but it has not convinced me fully. I don't know why, maybe there are just too many things, maybe because it's hard to see the point value of the actions you're doing...

- The art and overall production is top notch. It is consistently good and as close to its theme as Cuba's art is to its.
- While there appear to be a lot of rules and niggly bits, once you start everything becomes intuitive. You use Feet or Fruit to get places. You use Shells or Fruit to buy stuff. You use the stuff you buy to help you do other stuff (or get more Feet, Fruit and/or Shells) or to help you in end game scoring.
- The cost element is the game's shining light. Each turn chits are pulled and placed on locations, provided they are less than or equal to a given area's limit number. The number on a chit is the cost of a given thing in its area, with each area having 0-3 chits. Players cannot buy where there are no chits, so a given area might not be available in a turn. The number of chits also indicate how many items are available in that area for purchase. The first player to arrive in a given area pays the cost of any chit there (or pays double that for an extra benefit) and takes that chit; when there are no more chits, nothing else can be purchased in that area. The numbers on the chits (as well as fish) count for each turn's goal total.
- There are end game rewards that villages can qualify for. Its Vikings-like player board acts as an X-Y axis of scoring potentials. The X line uses Tikis that allow smaller (ie, shorter) villages to qualify. The Y line employs Kahunas for gaining points for many different villages, provided they qualify due to the Tikis.
- The game felt mostly fresh and new. However, there were elements that had a familiar feel to them. The individual player boards remind one of Vikings. The resource use is remiscent of Cuba. The variable board setup has been used in many games. Plus, every turn there is a minimum value in chit total that players need to score bonus points, a la The Princes of Florence, and there are Surfers who work akin to Jesters to help meet that total. I like all of these games, but Hawaii takes those elements and makes them its own.
- Overall, this is a simpler game than it first appears, but one with a lot of options to explore and numerous ways to achieve obectives. It is of medium complexity, but the theme might help new players overcome the shock of so many apparent parts. Give it a try and you might well find yourself immersed within its tropical wonder.

The modular setup provides very different experiences between sessions. Lots of ways of gaining the big points, and the balance between approaches depends on the setup.

Recommended for 3-4 players; Two-players games are not that interesting, and five player games are slightly too long.

Some ambiguities in the rulebook but these have been mostly addressed on the game forums.

There are a lot of details and many things to consider - and it's hard to teach! But perseverance is rewarded: it is an excellent game, albeit rather fiddly.

Briefly, players have five rounds to purchase tiles. Some points are scored at this time, but the majority are scored at end of game for combinations and synergies between tiles. Management of the resources used to purchase tiles is key. Through the game, economics are very tight and it is easy to go broke. In order to purchase tiles players must pay the travel cost required to reach the board element where they are available. The board is modular, with many arrangements possible - consequently there is plenty of variety between games.

There is time-consuming setup before play can start, and packing-up is complicated too. The rules are lengthy, but clear and well set out. Hawaii is not a terribly difficult game to teach or learn, but for a Euro it is pretty complex. I would probably not use it to introduce a newcomer to gaming.

For what it was, Hawaii satisfied everything I needed for a Euro in a record amount of time. It plays extremely fast and had the right amount of strategy to not turn me off. The most laborious task was refilling the turtle shells and doing the math after every round. But, overall, I enjoyed it: thematic, engaging and cute. Definitely will play again.

How do you jazz up worker placement? Make everything variable! Play over 5 rounds. There's lots of things you can buy but the cost of each changes each round, the number of places at each site varies each round, the things you buy at some sites will vary each round. So that cunningly crafted strategy goes out the door when it suddenly becomes ultra-expensive next round, meaning new options must be explored. So you'll need to take the luck in stride, or rather, set yourself up so you have multiple avenues to scoring. And there's lots of different ways to approach scoring in this game which is its strength - buy straight VP's, buy bonus VP tiles, buy stuff that builds an engine that allows you to buy more stuff later, buy legs so you can get to more sites each turn, and more and more and more. Meaning there's enough variety to pull you back for more games. There are lots of rules to cover off so getting through the first play is a challenge, but once you're up and going, it runs along at a decently enjoyable clip and has all that trademark worker placement tension you expect.

One of those that sounds harder in the rules explanation than it really is. The game flows well and hangs together; the varied board makes for a lot of varied gameplay as it alters the relative currency of the in game items.
As you'd expect all the components are well produced

So many choices!!!  But I love picking my strategy each game, especially as it has to evolve much of the time, as tiles get purchased and no longer are available to you.  And you REALLY have to manage your resources!  They are TIGHT in this game!  You have to manage your resources closely to make sure you get what you need; and then make sure you buy what you need in order to get resources!  Makes the brain burn just a little bit, and I love it!

RATING: 7
The main distinctive feature of this game is that you get rewarded for spending money for ordinary things.  You can spend double to get an extraordinary thing, but you still only get credit for the ordinary thing's price.  This works a bit like Princes of Florence--the threshold for scoring points goes up each round.  To make things more interesting, your base income goes down every round, so you need to either do some creative saving or find some extra sources of income to get in on the big late-game scoring rounds.  The rest of the game involved getting tiles to fill up your villages and make sure they scored, which could get pretty tense, particularly when someone else took what you needed.  The trade-off between buying good stuff and bad stuff was pretty interesting.

One 3-player + one 4-player game so far.

The use of two "currencies" for your placements - one for moving and one for buying - is my favourite feature of this game.

Nice bits and tiles, but almost too many of them - set up takes some time. The overall artwork and presentation is very good, although the theme is not particularly thrilling.

Played more than 20 games in Yucata.de and found it is a clever game. Even found more fun than Stone Age. A lot of path to get your victory points, a lot of elements need to consider when making decision, fast to finish a game, have different price on the items in each round. A must-buy game.

Aug 11, 2013 --- Just got this game from a friend and played 1 game with him. Though have spent some time to setup and teach him how to play, we have enjoyed the game a lot. I think a new play may need to play 3 or 4 games in order to get the full amusement that this game can provide.

Aug 21, 2013 --- Have played 120 games in yucata.de and still enjoy it a lot. Played two 2P games of its physical version. Feel a bit time consuming on setup and scoring. Will introduce it to more friends. Need 30 mins to explain the game, need to well prepare it.

Sep 22, 2013 --- Taught 3 non-gamers to play this game. They all feel the rules are complicated. Only played 3 rounds and end the game. I am thinking to simplify the first game by ignoring the fishing cove, islands, boats and target price of each round.

This game has a semi-randomized setup giving it tons of replayability, lots of different strategies to go for, and that fun euro thing where a little bit of action blocking and preventing one player from dominating just one thing goes a long way. There are lots of little clever design touches to the game as well, such as an ever decreasing income round to round, and a dollars spent check for bonus points which helps players who don't go for the x2 cost upgraded buildings.

Hawaii is not a bad design and has several clever features, but it's of a type that I'm fundamentally uninterested in. It's what I think of as a 'jigsaw puzzle' game, with the designer starting from the 4 or 5 paths to victory he wants the game to have, breaking those strategies up into component parts, scattering them around the board, and then imposing some arbitrary constraint on how the players put them back together. You know the picture you're trying to make, you just don't know how well you'll be able to get the pieces together. It also has the problem of having way too fiddly a setup and rules to be a true medium-weight, but not enough depth to be a heavyweight.

One of my favourites. A race to gather and build the best available points engine in a limited time. The engine you use changes all the time as the cost of everything keeps changing during the game and between games, so you are kept thinking hard about how to best employ and replenish the diminishing amount of "money" you get each round (there are three types of currency that get used during the game, one for purchase, one to move around the board and one that can do either. You end up with some of all three usually). A lot of budgeting and prioritising going on in this game, so I love it. Enjoy the theme and board design as well, especially the sky blue box and board. Very pleasant. Mid weight, lots of fun.

Update: Still like it 2 months later. Now one of my "go to" games.

I thought this was pretty good. The second game we played my Wife just used my strategy from the first game and won easily. I thought that was weird because we knew exactly what she was doing and nothing we did was able to prevent it from happening. Also, I felt that going last right from the beginning seemed to put me at such a disadvantage for the rest of the game. I'm sure further plays could be better but we have so many great Euro games that there is no point.

Tried it with my wife as a 2-player game. It didn't thrill us - at all! I'm not sure if it's because of the limited number of players, but we didn't feel any excitement during our game. It was an ok game, but slightly boring towards the end. We also didn't feel any urge to try it again and give it another chance.

All in all, it felt very... generic. Go there, buy that, if you're lucky the prices in next round will suit your plan. If you're not... well, bad luck. I think the random element (prices for different tokens) ruined it for us, or at least for me (even though I won). Strategizing is not very viable, in the end everything comes down to the prices.

Every round was very similiar to the previous one, there wasn't any "build up" feeling. There are many better medium euros out there I'm afraid.

A little like Stone Age or St Petersburg in that you choose a scoring route (fruit + multipliers, village multipliers, etc) and hope it all works out in the end. It is quite elegant and clever, but slightly overlong in the five player games I've had - but there's enough scoring options to make you want to work through the game a dozen times.

Like Stone Age, expecting this to fall off the radar sooner rather than later. Enjoying it at the moment though.

If this game were less fiddly with a bit faster setup time, I would rate it even higher.  I really like this hybrid economic game that blends gameplay between worker placement-like elements and the build-up economy play of a game like Vikings (which I also enjoy).  As is though, as long as I can get in at least 2-3 games each time I set the game up, it's awesome!  Great components that are unusually thematic for this type of game.  Many ways to play, and the changing prices from round to round, with islands and tile locations changing from game to game keep it from becoming too formulaic and ensure you must adjust and re-adjust your strategy instead of always going for the same upgrades in the same order.

I really like the look and feel of Hawaii. It resembles a lot of other games yet manages to feel pretty unique. Perhaps the two games it resembles most are Vikings and Pantheon. Hawaii is clearly a tile laying game, however, at it's heart Hawaii is more of an action-point/resource management game. Knowing the right time to purchase each tile is key.

There are only a few things holding Hawaii back from being a truly great game. With so many moving parts it can feel very fiddly. The rulebook covers all of the rules well enough, but it doesn't give a clear idea of the objective of the game, perhaps because there is no one path to victory here.

Overall- Hawaii takes a good bit of work to break into, but is well worth the effort. There's a well designed game under all the initial confusion. This can only get better with more plays.

Awesome game. The mechanics, while not groundbreaking, feel fresh, the artwork and theme are awesome, and the 2p game is excellent. Pawn movement, managing various forms of currency, tile collection for either powers or point scoring, and turn order management all play a role as you build your village. The game is highly interactive, and timing (along with some opportunism, balancing strategy with tactics) is key to winning. The 2p game can be played in under an hour.

Sept. 2012: Picked up in GenCon Math Trade last month. Really enjoying it in person and on BoardGameArena. Not sure I'd have paid retail price for it, but it's a fun game that scales down to 2 players well (and it's quicker with fewer players). Tom V. was wrong and the lack of variability because it's there in the random placement of prices each round along with the random placement of tiles each game.  Right now I'm rating it an 8.

Decide what things to collect, how to build your village and make the most victory points. I guess there are several strategies to victory. Altough every player builds his own village, there is still a lot of interaction between the players. Several nice concepts like fishing, building village, spending 'feet' to access tiles, gain majority of shells at turn end.

A game where you work your economic engine not to do better, but to avoid doing worse as the income declines through the game.  A variety of ways to score points allow players to play tactically to optimize with the choices available to them when they take their turn but still allowing one to keep in mind a few overall strategies.

Components and games seems to be nicely tuned to encourage efficiency as well.

It's a perfectly fine game, but it's nothing we haven't seen before many times over. In this day and age I'm looking for either a new twist to a mechanic, or at least a very smooth and thematic version of an existing mechanic. It's engaging and fine to play, especially with more players, just not very inspiring. Vikings is in a similar vein, but has less rules clunkiness and the clever bidding wheel. This is just a bunch of different currencies to buy production and points buildings. There's an engine to be built and then a matter of timing to grab the victory points. It works and would have been better received by me ten or even five years ago, but in 2012 it leaves me uninspired. Happy to play but don't need to explore further.

I'm pleased this game got a reprint and plan to play it a lot in the coming years.

Hawaii -- Played twice; three-player.

Eric played a strong game throughout. Rich and I floundered. But we certainly learned a lot. Interestingly, going into the final round, I had well less than half the points of the other two — but in the end, all our scores were in a 7-point range.

If we can manage to play again soon, we'll be able to play much more strategically. Rich and I were able to easily identify which plays cost us important opportunities. For example, I built four tikis, enabling me to score shorter villages, yet I only built 2 villages, both of them long. The advantage offered by tikis therefore went to waste. 

In our session, the place tile where gods are acquired was at the far end of the island. I imagine that the game will play very differently when players can acquire gods more easily, since gods' advantages help dictate strategy.

I think we could really like this. But it may slow down too much with more than 3 players.

Excellent game which combines a number of clever mechanics in a, well, clever way. Theme is thin but everything is fun and the components look good. Fun to play and reasonably fast. Long-term planability is limited and there is some risk-taking, but I would not go so far as call it overly luck-dependent.  There is some luck, but that is more a matter of playing safe or taking some risk than all-out luck. If take risks, you might get screwed. Thats what luck is about. Decisions matter, some AP might happen but casual play is also possible. Multiple ways to score points, diversity is necessary - there can be no winning strategy, as costs vary each game and each turn, so you cannot depend on a fixed set of tiles, because those might be too expensive to get int a given game.

- annoying coin setup before rounds begins
- tokens are nice, but 1 and 5 should be more different

Fun little euro with movement and a map.  Lots of fun decisions, and the way that the map shifts from game to game pushes the diverse combination of paths through different incentives.  There are some familiar euro concepts of engine building and worker placement, but the mutability of the cost and the reward of opportunity cost for building your engine stronger vs the value of reaching the round scoring is really compelling.

Reminds me a lot of Vikings and Sun, Sea, and Sand since it involves worker placement and tile placement on a personal grid.  The theme is not incorporated into the mechanics at all, but it is still fun to say Hawaiian lingo.  It is a fairly complex game; I would call it a medium weight game.  A decent Eurogame -  I give it a seven out of hang ten.

This is a fun, tightly-designed well-balanced worker-placement type of game. The board has a variable setups every game will play out differently. The various tiles on the board stock different types of tiles, and are in randomized positions each game. Players move their tokens around the board, paying foot-meeples to move, buying the tiles using fruit- or wild meeples. Tiles may provide income, or VP, or modify various items in the game. Costs are also variable each round. It becomes an optimization game where you are trying to earn the most VP in the most efficient way, depending on what the other players are doing. Most VP after 5 rounds wins!

A solid design!

Achieves the distinction of taking a beautiful place like Hawaii and that inspiration results in a dry, boring game with no color and no soul.  It seems since Agricola came out that it led to numerous cube pushing games that are overly complicated and have many non-intuitive ways to score.  What happened to games with elegantly simple rules and gameplay featuring difficult decisions?  I'll say Aloha to this one in the goodbye sense.

One of those HiG stylish euro games. I like it. It's fun and challenging. It has some tiles better than others but once all players know them well enough the game seems balanced. And it's one of those cases in which the game isn't over until the fat lady sings, for sure. Nobody seems to understand who's going to win until the end of the story.
Theme is zero and gaming experience too. Worths for the challenge!

V provisional rating based on 1 play. Really like, Vikings like end game scoring with a constant struggle between competing for points each round versus end game versus engine building, though sometimes two of three work together. The random number and cost of action spots, and the opposition of the in round scoring v investment payoff is a beautiful design feature .

Beautiful HIG production ( feet from Pantheon and Fruit from Finca) and a typical middle weight from this publisher, I think this might be the most successful HIG offering since Stone Age

---------

2nd play cemented the ranking as a 9 - this is one of the best middle weight Euros released in years

--------------

Play 3 -6 in close succession - love this game

Played another 5 on boardgamearena - and have to say this have fired Stone Age as short medium depth game, so many paths to victory and in 2 player game opportunities for screwage

Prefer with less than four

RATING: 9.7
Love the game! Not a brain burner yet has so many choices and things to condsider and many paths to victory.

I love games with modular board and resource setups.  Also, love games with upgrades and engine building (which Hawaii has hidden subtly).

You have to juggle 3 resources (shells = $, feet = movement, and fruit = wild) whether you have enough movement points, and if you'll have enough money to buy everything that you want at all the spots you are planning to land on.

Also have to take into account that your opponents may buy up some of the items you had planned to get, so you need to predict what they are going after too and be tactical and adjust.

Part of the fun is deciding if you're going to buy something that will upgrade your ability to get more resources per turn your "engine" or upgrades, or if you're going to go straight for points and things that give you point scoring multipliers, or invest in other options like a boat so that you can reach the random resources and bonuses found on islands that are not readily accessible unless you invest in purchasing a boat.

All of this happens while you are aiming to meet the minimum requirements for each round so that you get "paid" resources and money (shells) to use in the next round.

As the rounds progress you get less and less money and resources paid out to you so you need to constantly be upgrading your "engine".

All this juggling yet it's still a fun relaxed game with beautiful game components.  

Bagging all the separate types of tiles separately greatly reduces set up time which is one of the complaints some people have.  

However, the modular board and variety of random tiles that makes every game slightly difference strategically is well worth it!

An enjoyable light worker placement game. In the same complexity range as Stone Age, but unfortunately, also a lot more fiddly.
On the up side, there's a lot less luck involved and the game seems to offer a lot more choice. On the downside, this means it's a lot more puzzly and about optimising your moves. Still, I like it.

RATING: 6
Players pay feet-tokens to move around the island buying huts, islanders and other Hawaiiania to add to a personal tableau strongly reminiscent of Vikings. It plays smoothly despite its clunkiness, there are a number of different strategies to pursue and the spatial movement element and variable prices keeps things from becoming stale. Perhaps the most interesting feature is players' declining income; differentiation in early choices is keenly felt in the endgame.

I've got some qualms, though. It's one of those games with an annoying, inelegant grab-bag of min-max opportunities and most players will probably end up with a little of everything. The changing prices tend to encourage this even more than usual because adhering to a strategy may not be cost-effective -- and also drive a strong luck factor. Setup time and maintenance between turns feels over-long and there is too much to explain, including some clunky exceptions, for a game of this light weight.

It's more or less the definition of "Just Another Soulless Euro", and it doesn't even have any mechanical novelty (like Macao's Windrose) to elevate it. A solidly generic game.

RATING: 8
First Play : After punching the gazillion cardboard chits we went through the, at first glance, daunting setup process.  In reality, it was quite easy due to the graphic matching of chits to board pieces.  It will still be a chore in future plays but is not as taxing as the separating and layer stacking Brass employs.

The random setup is great and will lead to varying plays, mostly in the pricing of tiles and the distance to acquire them.  The rule book is decent and could have used a touch more editing but it does the job.  Once we got to playing we only referred to the short reference guide.  A good sign that the process was easily remembered.

There is an outstanding number of ways to score points.  I like that it creates a nice bit of exploration to do.  The game play is smooth and familiar with a lot of tension created by the demand of the happiness factor you must meet each round.  The game forces you into a corner that makes you get creative.  

The area building is slightly easier than Vikings and you have much more control over what you want to do.  This is good because most tiles give you added benefits and abilities.  I wouldn't want to add the threat of disaster          to this mix.  This may be much different in the 4 player game but there are so many tiles available I don't see this happening.

To anyone teaching the game : Clearly communicate the end game scoring conditions.  You can easily get lost in all the hoopla of the various tiles and forget there is an end game goal that you missed completely.  Scoring during the game is the majority chunk of points but the end game will push the winner over the top.

Overall, an enjoyable experience and I look forward to playing again.

Short review : Pleasantly surprised to find this a meaty, medium weight euro that is interesting looking and comfortable.

3p:  Very tense with a lot of unknowns.  It was hard to keep track of what the others were doing.  I would say it became very tactical as my strategy changed almost every round. The winner was decided by leading in in-game scoring and a major end game boost.  A good game I want to play more of. 

4p : Tough to get what I wanted due to the limitation of pricing chits.  Yes, there are lots of tiles but less chance of getting them!

I am astounded at the different approaches you can try in this game.

Move, pay money, take a tile. Repeat.

I'm possibly a little overly harsh, but this brought nothing new to the table. I was bored by turn two and wasn't sure what the game was trying to achieve. It's too short to be an engine builder but it has tiles that suggest this. The random prices are an interesting idea but if the tile or two you need are either blocked out or over priced you are forced to either miss out which cripples you or over pay ... which cripples you.

Essentially, random events that can elimate you from contention make this a basically random game.

Some interesting ideas, but I really disliked this.

A great, tight little euro. Plays in a good amount of time, isn't too complex and is a nice change to some of the heavier euros I play, while still offering a smorgasbord of choice and strategy. I love the engine building, a dash of worker placement tension (should I take a less efficient action because I'm scared my opponent might take it?) and the theme works nicely. Trying to manage your economy with points generating can be difficult but fun.

A fun game with interesting strategy and good decisions. It has similar mechanics to other games (very similar to Vikings) but was different enough for us to still really enjoy it.

The one thing that struck me the most was how, in a point-salady–like game like this, you actually have to choose what to get points for by selecting specific tiles. Near the end of our first game I realized that I wasn’t really concentrating on point generators but on just building my villages which don’t necessarily give points.

Also the wooden feet are awesome!

In spite what other people are saying, this is a great Euro game. The components are of high quality. The game mechanisms are simple and interesting. There are multiple paths to victory.

Also with 4 players is over in 2 hours (including explanations). New players after the first round know exactly how the game plays. It is not that complex. Very nice game!

RATING: 7
[thing=106217][/thing] is a worker placement, mostly focused in prioritize actions, as the spaces are limited (very limited when playing with 4 or 5), and thus the turn order is particularly important here.

The main ideia is use workers to take buildings and people, in order to gain increase income, points (during play or at the end), and other advantages. [thing=106217][/thing]  has two currencies: shells and feets. To go to the places you need in order to take the things you want, you pay with feets; than to take the tile, you pay with shells. The cost in shells is random, coming from blind chits draw at the start of the round - places have from 1 to 3 spots for chits, but not all of them might be used, as they have limits to the value they can hold. The player has the option of paying double the cost of a chit, in order to take the token on its strong side.

Initially shells and feets are easy to come by, as the normal income is high. But the income decreases each round, making things much harder, specially in the final round, as the is no income, except those coming from the players buildings.

Overall, [thing=106217][/thing] is a well knitted game, with fast resolution, as it has quick turns and just 5 rounds. It gives a lot of room for different strategies, while also giving a good amount of indirect interaction. Replay value is quite high, due to the modular board and the positioning of the cost chits. It isn't strong on theme, but I wasn't expecting it to be. In the end, I liked [thing=106217][/thing] and recommend it.

A typical HiG game in some ways. This, I would consider a medium Euro that is heavier than St. Petersburg, Masons or Stone age, but probably on par with Goa. As others have noted, there are many similarities to Vikings, especially with the development of the personal villages. The multitude of choices of this game reminds of other games such as Village. The complexity of this game does not come from the various different actions available, but rather similar "purchase" actions with different goods purchased. These goods range from visiting islands, fish or builiding, tikis, kahunas, boats...etc. The relationship between the three currencies allow for some flexibility but also restricts the purchase power since you are as rich as your poorest resource. This resource bottleneck also forces players to specialize to a certain extent - buying into the "feet" currency allows you to visit islands all the time. Getting shells allows you to buy buildings. Ultimately, a mix of strategies is probably required to secure victory since the usage of the currencies are intertwined and one cannot just solely focus on one type over the other.

In the end, Hawaii is a pleasant extension of the Euro genre. There is really nothing groundbreaking in terms of mechanics, but everything flows relatively well and the mechanics does integrate properly. The one criticism I have comes from the random pricing and token selection. Apart from feeling fiddly and time-consuming, the selection of a particular strategy is often limited by the randomly selected price of the commodity. There is no way to anticipate if a chosen pathway will be fruitful since it may become extremely expensive to acquire items in that category down the road. Similarly, your opponent's strategy may end up being successful not because they played better, but because they can purchase twice as many items due to lower prices that is not directly determined by supply or demand, but rather by luck.

Good game, will be part of my collection, but won't be a superstar.

Only one play. One of the player had the Spear Strategie. One Spear hut per village, plus Spears gods... 5 to 6 points each time he pick a turtule token with spears.
Also, full of tikis ans surfers for a huge end game bonus.
An easy 150 points victory.
Fruits strategy seems to be realy weak. Island strategy is good but not as much as spear's one.

But as the board can change each game, perhaps it could be different the next time. To be verified.

After 5 plays:
It seems that we made a mistake concerning fruits in my first game because they are really usefull, mainly in a two players game.

So this game is very good.

I was overjoyed to first see this at the playtest table.  The original artwork was perhaps even better than what we see now.  The mechanisms used are so easy to understand.  All-in-all a polished gem.
A very small criticism that may have resulted from an entirely understandable desire to reduce the amount of printed cardboard: The Round #1 token with its flip side for gamestart income is a bit too confusing.  I am willing to bet that at least 5% of 1st-timers who learn the game from the rules will somehow flub the Round sequence.  I know we did (we were playing with the German rules) and our first game was way too punishing as a result.  We caught the error by our second game, but how many new-to-the-game players didn't?

light worker placement game with lots of interesting mechanics, works great with 2p and more

[+] variable setup each round offer great replayability, good mix of strategy & tactics, good artwork, love the "spendings" objective, the incentive to get 2nd/3rd player spots, tons of ways to score points, great spacial elements as well (tikis/kahuna grid to score your villages)
[-] variable setup each round is a pain (good reason to play online)

Tom Vasel proves yet again how out of touch he is with modern eurogames, my wife and I both found Hawaii to be an excellent mid-weight game.

Functionally, there are two currencies in the game, feet and shells. On your turn, you spend feet to move around the board, and then spend shells to buy tiles which you build up in your play area. There are a ton of different tiles providing various benefits, better income in feet or shells, fruits which are wild, end game points and so on.

What I really like about the game is the variability. Each game is totally different than the next, as the tile layouts are done randomly in setup. So, in one game the shell income huts might be close to the beach and easy to acquire, in the next far away and tougher to get to. Also, each game round starts by setting all the tile prices randomly by drawing tokens from a bag. So it's very tactical as you size up the board and where you might want to move this turn, and how much are you willing to spend to get that tile you need.

Also, pretty much everything gives you points in the game, so it's one of those games where you bask in the glory of good moves most of the time. Ultimately the best moves win, but the rest of us feel like we're getting somewhere and doing something too. No painful slogs just scraping by here (although income reduces each round and can get tight near game end).

If there's a negative here, it's that setup can be a bit fiddly for the tiles (having a good storage system makes this a non-issue). Also, you have to draw 20+ price tokens each round, and that takes a minute or two. But that's really nit-picking, I don't find it a problem at all.

Hawaii seems like a respectable game.  It has some major similarities to Stone Age, even though the game lacks dice and uses a different mechanism to control the worker placement action, because it forces you to balance your efforts between in-game scoring and end-game scoring.  That the end-game scoring can have such a huge effect on the win drives that similarity home even further.  Because currencies are tight in the game, it frustrates me that the price of some actions is randomly determined at the start of each round.  That works against players making sound strategic choices, because you don't know how much things will cost next round, and you can't manage your money well enough to really do what you want to do.  It seems like the game could easily come down to one player getting the price he needs for what he wants to do on the last turn, and someone else doesn't.  That doesn't seem like the definition of a good game to me.

Hawaii is not for everyone. If you are typically opposed to Stefan Feld style Euros, the type that arbitrarily reward you with victory points for completeing a list of generally unrelated actions, you will absolutely loathe this game. The theme makes for an attractive, visually consistent style, but there is little that attaches that theme to the game's mechanisms. There is no narrative arc to the game and no definable objective. Each round you are simply trying to achieve a perpetually rising target score, while picking up as many end game bonuses as possible. Sounds bad, right?

Well, it's not. While the theme is indeed largely meaningless, it does make for some attractive components. The game's economy is also very interesting, with players having to juggle two different resources to pay for things, as well as markets whose supply and prices both fluctuate from round to round. The board set-up is randomized every game, so the locations of each market will also vary, giving each session its own flavor. It all makes for a surprisingly interesting puzzle, especially when some timing considerations enter into play. While you are trying to optimize your path to best utilize your resources, your opponents are racing to the same spots to fulfill their own needs. It adds a sense of pushing your luck, as you try to grab as much as possible without over extending and suffering penalties for spending too much time shopping.

It's all very engaging and I have thoroughly enjoyed my plays so far. The complaints I have heard about the set-up time or the large amount of between round maintenance are silly. It takes literally two minutes between rounds, tops. If it bothers you that much, go get a beer or something and let someone else take care of it. It's a smooth process and one I'm glad to endure for the variety it provides to the game.

Gestionale molto interessante con ottimi materiali ed un tema accativante. A differenza dei soliti gestionali in cui si comincia con poche risorse e pian piano aumentano qui, più si avnaza nella partita più le risorse scarseggiano, e da questo punto di vista si dimostra innovativo, per il resto nulla di più.

This feels like a lighter version of Bora Bora combined with some Wikinger mechanics. But it plays very smoothly and as well with two as with four players. Which is pretty important for us. You have a limited number of choices and therefor every decision matters. Because of the setup rules, replayability is guaranteed. If we get our hands on it, this will probably hit the table regularly. ... And now we own it!

A game that proves I am getting jaded.  It is attractive, sort of thematic, and works well.  But, there is nothing here that compels me to go back and play it again.  A worker placement game where your worker moves (you pay with a separate movement currency), but I can't say that it adds much to the game.

All in all, meh . . .

nice and interesting game to be played online.
I would say: don't buy this game because, even if i never did it myself, i am sure the setup is soooo long that it's not worth it. if PC is taking care of everything then the game is fast and really really interesting. every game is different as all the resources are scattered in a different way. you can follow hundreds of strategies to make points and the replayability is at a peak here.

This game makes me smile.  We are chiefs of island villages walking around the main island to get resources to improve the lives of our people.  Fun dynamics as you build your island managing its growth within the protection limits of your tikis. Be warned, it is a little more brainy than the carefree scene suggests.  Make sure you understand the rules before putting on the table.

My 3rd game in of Hawaii (1 2 plyr, and 2 3 plyr) and I am enjoying the weight of play and strategic options. So far hulu girl has played a big role in end game scoring. Also the god that allows you move anywhere on the island for 2/1 clams is a biggie. Also the mid game scoring mechanisms get vps for each shell that has spears on it can score big points esp if combo'd and not checked by someone else. Boats seem also to be another option not fully utilised as yet. Seems to be many avenues. Great game - Jan 2013

I was in a semi-receptive state of mind in my first game of Hawaii, for two reasons.

One, because I'd played Vikings only once, and that was six years go.  So naturally I can't frown upon any similarities between Hawaii and Vikings - because I don't remember Vikings in the slightest.

Second, because - after unpleasant periods of anger and betrayal - VP-engine Euros and I had a bitter divorce years ago.  I despise them unrelentingly, and they despise me.  So playing Hawaii after a long respite from Euros was like seeing an ex-wife out of the blue decades after the final separation.  It's not bad for a short while, and it's all the better that you're not going home together.

Still, the dull sameness is all there.  In this style of game, as we all know, endgame VP bonuses tend to determine the winner.  The best strategy, then, is to purchase the most efficient VP-scoring tile(s), and then spend the rest of the game feeding those tiles.  This approach necessarily leads to one-dimensional strategies, although Hawaii's turn order jockeying and fluctuating prices do monkey with this OCD design approach - which is a good thing.

All this means is that I liked Hawaii slightly more than I should have, and for no good reason.  Your own experience may differ.

Beautiful game from HiG and Greg Daigle. Greg has always made great prototypes and this is his first published game. It is a resource management/building game with a variable board for continued replays. The resources are feet (movement), shells(buying buildings), or fruit(can be either feet or shells but you cannot combine them). Lots of paths to victory. Very good game.

When we visited Essen last year, we noticed this game on a table in a corner. You could almost say that the publisher wanted to hide the game for the public. Before the table there was a small booth, where they sold the Spiel 2011, promotion for Carcassonne / Dominion. Besides that booth, a couple of people where packaging the promotions. As I am always very interested in packaging, I took a closer look, and then I saw it. The table with this game on it. I had to step over the people who were packaging the promotions to reach the table. What I saw was a typical family game. I memorized the name of the game, and went of with the journey at Spiel 2011.

Didn’t think of this game anymore until last week, when I noticed that it was new at the gaming club. As we both like family games, we wanted to play this one. When we arrived at the club, we started to set-up this game. Somebody wanted to explain the game to us, and warned us. Setting-up and explaining this game is a lot of work. Three other people joined in, and we were ready to start a 5-player game. Indeed, setting up and explaning the game was a lot of work. But when it was finished, it was clear that this could be a fun game. In fact, the game is pretty simple. A game takes five rounds to play, and each round you can do the following:

    move onto the main island and purchase items and extensions for your villages
    go fishing at the fishermen’s harbor to get fish tokens
    visit an island and receive some bonus
    move to a free space on the turn order board and mark this position for the next round. This final action quits the player’s round (no more actions allowed anymore).

And that’s it. Nothing more, nothing less. The trick in this game, that the first action possible (move onto the main island and purchase items and extensions for your villages). There are a lot of possibilities, or maybe better to call it opportunities, for you. Each of these opportunities will give you something that will give you profit. You can’t make a bad decision, because everything you do, is good

As said, we played a 5 player game. Tactics were pretty important in this game. After reading the rules, I noticed that there are no adjustments in the rules when playing this game with less players. Especially for a 2 player games this worries me. When playing this game with just 2, the possible choices you can make each round, are not that limited. The might be expensive, but that’s pretty much it. Also the fact, that the amount of valuable things are hidden for the other players are strange to me. When they are hidden, it just comes to the memory of the other players, but when everything is open, the game will become even more tactical, because you can base your decisions on your opponents stack of goods.

There is a lot more into this game, then I described above. While playing, it gave me the feeling that it was something like Stone Age. But with a twist. By saying that, I mean it isn’t a real family game. But it isn’t a game, for somebody who likes deep strategy. It’s deeper than the average game for families and is much lighter then a strategy game which will take you hours of play, and you have to think about your next move about 10 minutes. This is a nice game for the somewhat experienced gamer. A bit luck, a bit strategy, a lot of possibilities. It’s no top 100 game, but you can have some nice time with this game.

Too easy for my taste. The game seems to offer you strategic choices, like do you want to score points for all 5 of your villages OR do you want construct a real big village that gives you lots of points? Which rounds do you want to score the round points? But you can do all of it and score points every round if you got the hang of it. And thats not cool.

The epitome of boring. This is everything that is wrong with the turn Eurogames are taking these days. I swear some guy who works at the Euro Game Mechanics factory was sweeping some leftovers off the floor and decided to package them up and sell them to us poor saps. This snoozefest could have been designed and published in 1977 and no one would have noticed.

Many of these "buzzworthy" eurogames these days make me feel like a monkey turning a gear to make colored cubes and victory points pop out of my contraption. In this one, the monkey suffers from narcolepsy.

I have no idea why I gave Dominion such a low score. Maybe because my introduction to deck builders was less than ideal. Others are better at certain elements, but overall, Dominion is where it's at. Upgrading from 7.5 to 8.5.

Is not that easy to teach as everybody make believe but it doesn't matter because I love it, is fast and fun. It can feel a little bit as a solitaire game if there is a  analysis paralysis case on the table.

Crack in a box! Bought it in late 2008, before I joined the Geek. Otherwise there would be about 50 more games of this next to "Plays" as my husband and I spent entire weekends playing game after game of Dominion.

RATING: 8
Based on 1 play.
I really enjoyed it and I had that "want to play again straight away" feeling.  It did seem a little like a solitaire game, but then I probably wasn't looking too closely at what my opponents were doing. And we were playing a game with only "Militia" as an interaction card.
Looking forward to playing again.

Update: Played again.  Want to play some more!

The rating of 9 is for the Dominion family.  This is the game that turned me into a board game geek.  The Adventures expansion caused me to take a break from Dominion.  I will still play it, but am willing now to play other new games first to give them a try.  No longer am I wanting to spend an entire evening playing only Dominion.

Raw, unadulterated engine building in it's finest deck building form. By itself, the game clips right along at 2p, and the probability of deck drawing gives it enough of a risk management that the engine you create doesn't just sit and crank through until late in the game. I like Trains a little more for the deck building mechanic though as it uses an area influence map, but that suffers from a bad theme implementation (while this doesn't have that problem even if it's sort of pasted-on), leaving this as the deck builder of choice. That said, there is basically zero interaction in Dominion, and it's fundamentally about creating a card combo in your engine and running it as hard as possible. The game ultimate seems to flop over once people learn the combos.

Best on the tablet (even the fugly old edition that was free) where it takes almost no time at all to crank out a game.

RATING: 8.5
I have played this game three times now and like it more and more each time I play it. The fact that there are so many different sets of cards and you don't play with all of them each time makes for a very replayable game. Every time we have played we have tried a different combination of cards and each time it feels like it is a new game. 

The game is very easy to learn too. I taught my 13 year old daughter in about five minutes and she beat me the first time she played. Of course I was giving her hints along the way, which helped her a lot. My fifteen year old son has beat me both times we have played. I highly recommend it!

One of my favorite games. An amazingly simple set of mechanisms makes for an amazingly addictive and enjoyable experience. Just in the base set alone there is a ton of variety in the card types and abilities. One of the best parts of Dominion is the way I can custom tailor my deck to my play style and try to shoot for victory in my own way. Dominion is the ultimate game that fits under the banner of "easy for inexperienced players to understand, but massive depth to explore for experienced players".

I have only owned this game a couple of weeks and it has become an instant favourite of ours.  Unlike other board games it is quick and easy to set up and play, so we have played it a lot more than many other games already.

In fact we played it almost every evening in the first week we got - testament to its addictiveness.  Also, it is one of the first games that I have been considering buying add-ons for.

Highly recommended!

RATING: 7
One of our gateway games. I still enjoy playing this one, but it is harder and harder to find willing players so it mostly just sits on our shelf. It can be a very quick game, so I still enjoy playing it. If it was any longer I would rate it lower.

Update 7-24-16: I was unkind in my opinion of this game in lowering the rating to a 6. Even though we gave this game away to my SIL as a game library building present, I've had a chance to play this many times since at various friends' houses, and have never turned down the chance. It's a great gateway game. We don't need to own it ourselves anymore, but it doesn't make it a bad game. Bumping it back up to a 7.

Shuffling: the Game. 
When a game is STRICTLY worse played live as opposed to online you have to ask yourself how and why on earth did it get made into a boardgame in the first place. 
Live it takes 30-40 minutes. Online 5-10. That is 10 minutes of gameplay in 30+ minutes... The rest is shuffling, waiting for your turn, fiddling with cards, counting everything that could and should be done by a computer, not you. 
There are countless opportunities to make an error live. You don't know how many cards are left in each stack, in your deck, your opponents'... which is basic and vital information. 
There's so much downtime. Due to poor design a third of the game is spent just buying victory points. And worst of all, there's no interaction! 
It's okay as an app on your phone. It's miserable as a boardgame.

Would have rated a 9 when I first played,  but I always played the same strategy (picked cards that draw, pick cards that give actions, buy Province when I have enough, rinse repeat.

RATING: 6.5
A card game that scales well from 2-4 players, has good variability, and a unique deck-building mechanic which puts a different spin on the current engine building game craze.

Gameplay is simple: always draw 5 cards, then A) play an action card(s), if possible.  These generally do things like get you more cards, allow for more buying opportunies, give extra money to build, etc., B) buy a card(s).  Cards come in 3 general forms: 1) point cards, which do nothing, but are what you need to score points (to win the game), 2) action cards, which give special abilities, and 3) money cards, which allow for purchases in the buy phase. C) clean up your deck, which is to say put all drawn cards into your discard pile.

As the game goes on, you will want to switch from money and powers to points.  The more points, the less flexibility you have.  Game ends when either 3 piles of different cards are emptied, or the 6 point card pile is empty.  There are several different types of action cards that you can substitute into play, which supposedly significantly affects gameplay.  I've only tried to mix things up once, and didn't notice much difference in the general strategy, but with more plays that may change.

This is a good game, a very solid filler, with some light strategy.  A top 10 game though?  Hardly.

After the played the base set a number of times, I became a bit disappointed in the game. Certainly that it established a wildly popular new genre of board game is noteworthy, but it also quickly feels like a very generic instance of the genre, particular as new games have built on it. Further, I was worried that, once the 10 card spread has been picked, a suitably experienced player would know their strategy immediately and just go through the motions. 

Then some friends asked me over to play the game with all of the expansions (except Alchemy, which we all agree bogs the game down). With the addition of Prosperity, suddenly this game had real depth, and I became hooked. The additions of Colonies (10 pt VP cards) and Platinums ($5), each game has a broad spectrum of decisions to make.

Contrarians dismiss this game though still one of the best deck-builders out there. No theme most of them say. I say so what? Theme does not a game make. Most don't have it. Most of those don't need it. This is one of those. I have all the expansions and haven't begun to tap the myriad possibilities that entails. I never mixed more than two sets yet.

Dominion is one of my favorite strategy games out there.  It's well-thought out, with great gameplay dynamics, and many possible variations in play.  I love that strategies can significantly change with a few changes in cards from game-to-game. 

Normally, card-oriented games tend to have a significant luck element, but Dominion is close to pure skill.  You really have to think about your actions, what sort of cards you are taking, how the cards work in relation to one another, what cards your opponents are taking, and how you can deal with difficult cards (such as "The Witch" and "The Thief"). 

I'd rank this #1 of the main Spiel des Jahres award winners that I've played. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Without a doubt one of the best games I own, including the sister game and all add-ons. This game has a simple basic rule-set but the cards provide variety. While other games have variety from game to game, Dominion almost seems like a different game every time you play. Critical thinking skills are both demanded and exercised by this game. The wording on the cards is clear and precise and requires players to have similar thinking to play. I generally use this game as a litmus test to see if others can think precisely, cleverly and deviously (as opposed to thinking fuzzy and using language lazily).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
I have a blast playing this game! Dominion is easy to teach and quick moving, which makes it ideal for casually deciding to play a game. I appreciate the card variety, which can make every game a different experience. That said, at a point you starting learning strategies and which cards are more OP, so the game can become less of a new challenge. I still love this game, but for that reason I'll definitely be looking to the expansions next.

RATING: 10
I can tell now why Dominion is so popular.  It's a simple enough game to learn, but there's a lot of depth here. I like the delicate balance you have to maintain between treasure/action cards and choosing when to start going after victory points. I'll definitely be playing a lot of this one.

Fun, and incredibly addictive! I love this game and everybody I introduce to it asks me where they can purchase it. The game starts out very basic, with only a small selection of options available, but every turn, the amount of things you can do grows even to the point where you have to laugh. I like the fact that this game is about putting combos together on the fly. See what options are available each turn to buy, see what kind of actions you can take, and watch your plan unfold turn by turn. The game is very simple to teach to others, but the strategies that are available give it tons of depth and infinite re-playability. Over all this game is great, one of my absolute favorite games! If I was going to lock myself in a nuclear fallout shelter for 50 years, and could only bring 50 games with me Dominion would be one of them.

Deck Builder, Competitive, Medieval

This is a complex game where all players start with the same small deck of cards and purchase new cards with unique effects from a pool of cards determined randomly at the beginning of the game. Complexity level varies but skilled players can construct strategies and combos similar to any TCG, it's a blast. The game ends when 3 different "resource" piles have been depleted, or the highest valued "victory point" card has been depleted. 

This is by far my favorite boardgame and the best one I have ever played.

(Please note my updates, modified over time and experience with this title).

INITIAL IMPRESSION: I don't yet fully appreciate the allure of deck-building... I continue to keep trying though, as there is something I must be missing. This will certainly stay on the shelf and I have every confidence the mystery will reveal itself to me.

UPDATE: I have no confidence that the mystery will reveal itself. None. I simply don't get it. To me, this seems as if it's a slot machine played with cards. Dominion obviously needs a home that has more love than I'm capable of giving it... thus it's traded (something I rarely do).

SECOND UPDATE: After taking an even longer break from this game, I repurchased it and I find I'm actually liking it. :) While it won't be my favorite game, it's unlike my past impressions a great deal -- much more favorable. This and the series are keepers for me now, I'm happy to say. I've always WANTED to like it, and now I can say that I do.

THIRD UPDATE: This is awesome. I'll play it whenever anyone wants to do so. The kids even like it. Win all around.

My girlfriend loves this game and almost always beats me, so for that reason alone it's one of the most valuable games on my shelf!  It isn't my favorite, and I find myself getting bored sometimes knowing it's just going to be a race for Provinces, but the kingdom card variation and the expansions do mix it up and keep it fun.  I shouldn't knock it too much...while it might not be the most interesting game, it's usually fun, and a good intro game for non-gamers.

This one has a special place in my game collection.  One, it was one of the first Euro-style boardgames I bought, and two, Shawn and I each had a copy, and we played it over Skype a lot when we were still in Long Distance Mode.  Since it's basically competitive solitaire, it's a nice one to play remotely.  The base deck is great, though the husband and I prefer the cards that have great buying power, rather than attack power.

Design philosophy behind Dominion: take a cool new idea and bury it in a game that panders to the lowest common denominator among Eurogamers. Sell lots of units.

When did Eurogames become synonymous with drafting? Oh, yeah, Puerto Rico.

Played this quite a bit on Goko - this game is quite fun! I think it plays best with 2 players, as more players actually shrink the strategy space (by giving you fewer turns to build a cool engine, thus shifting you toward more boring strategies that load up on VP faster).

The game is quite a bit more fun with all the expansions; I shamelessly just join games on Goko that already have them rather than actually buying it.

By far, my favorite card game.  The number of card combinations makes each play slightly different from the last.  The winner tends to be the one that can adapt best to what's currently available.  A nice blend of solitaire and interactivity.

An interesting game of deck building. I'm not sure if it is my cup of tea, but I do respect the design and potential for expansion. I must play a few more times before I make up my mind. I'm sure this'll appeal to a lot of people, especially the CCG/Race for the Galaxy crowd.

In my opinion the worst of top 10 games. I've played 4 times and only the first one was nice. From the second play, when me and co players started to know what to do, the Dominion parties became longer and boring to me. Turns, when someone has good cards in hand and start to produce big combo killed my enjoy from the game. In the other hand, when available sets doesn't allow to produce big combos, new cards are collected slowly and the play lasts long time, too long as for game of this type.

The game that started the deck building revolution, and still one of the best.  Will always be a classic, but I've gotten rid of mine as it has been replaced by newer games that do more interesting things.  Clank, Thunderstone, Legendary, and many others.

4 games in now and this is very enjoyable with a nice pace. I really like the fact that some turns the plays are obvious, whereas others you are setting up interesting combinations. And the fact that the various decks make for very different games. Excellent game that I will happily play anytime.

A very quick abstract game.  I think this sort of game is the epitome of Euro to me - excellent mechanics, an interesting theme but the 2 are totally disconnected.  I think this would improve with more plays, as you’d come to know which cards did what and which were better to take.  But I have no burning desire to play it again.

You start with a barebones/crappy deck and slowly improve it by adding better cards & trashing less good cards.  

Basically, you must choose between cards that make your deck better at making your deck better (huh? yes, really) or cards that give you victory points.  At the game's end, the deck with the most VP's wins.  

A very interesting game.

LIKE: non-combat card game, interesting concept
DISLIKE: I dislike card games with too much reading, and this is no exception. Not an easy game to pickup quickly, you really have to know how the different cards interact with another. too much player experience imbalance.

OVERALL: I want to like this game, but I've had multiple bad experiences playing it, and overall did not have much fun.

RATING: 7.5
Very good indeed. I like speed of course and the idea of building a custom deck of cards while playing the game - flat out brilliant. It is simplistic which is (of course) both good - making it easy to teach - and bad - making it somewhat repetitive. Although I must say it isn't repetitive to me just yet. It'll certainly get a ton of plays. And I think will fit the lunch crowd just perfect as this game plays in 20-30 minutes.

EDIT: After many more plays, I disagree with the notion that this game is formulaic - although admittedly, it plays much more like that on-line. I still find it challenging to optimize my purchases - which is very nice indeed.

EDIT: Ok, it *is* formulaic. Once you know the cards well, it is highly mechanical in play. This is why expansions are very much needed to continue interesting play. But I am not attracted to that idea (having bought only one expansion) and instead, am looking for a deck builder replacement.

The more I play this game the less I enjoy it.  At first, it seemed like a very innovative game.  Over time, however, I've come to realize that it's no where near as innovative as I first thought.  And after a while, it's just gotten down right dull.  I've played a good amount on BSW (I don't record games unless they are face-to-face).  And after about 20 games I just developed a loathing for the game.

I'll still play it if others want to...  but I certainly won't go out of the way for it.

RATING: 7.1
Great for a 30-40 minute filler game.  Plays fast and the base game allows for a fair amount of variation.  A great introduction to deckbuilding.

Unfortunately, while this game was met with initial high praise from me, it really hasn't stood up to repeated plays.  Out of the box, the game allows for a wide range of variability (in terms of different cards being in each game), but over time the game doesn't feel different enough from game to game to really make such variability worth it.  At the end of the day, it always feels like the same basic arc regardless of what cards are in the game.  

I'm willing to admit that this perception may just be due to fatigue with this particular title--it has reached [i]Ticket to Ride[/i] levels of absurdity in terms of additional expansions, and there seems to be a large number of people willing to acquire just about all of them (which I only complain about because these are the same people who always want to play [i]Dominion[/i] because they have a new shiny expansion for it, despite the fact that the underlying game really hasn't changed that much).  It's awesome for a gateway game, I just try to get people to graduate from titles of this depth sooner rather than later due to my preference for heavier games.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Don't love this as much as I did the first couple times I played it. The more I play the more I get the feeling the game gives the illusion of variability rather than actual variability. I just found it a little boring the past few time I've played.

RATING: 8
I don't know if this was the first game to introduce the concept of deck building as a mechanic but it is certainly one of the most well known and best designed out there. Dominion is a solid game that will probably stand the test of time. It plays like a ccg but is (allegedly) a closed set of cards. The "last" set, adventures just game out so in theory, if rio grande ever decides they don't like printing money, the game will stop coming out with sets. Dominion has simple, literally as simple as "ABC" core rules that are dressed up with a myriad of different card types. Each time you play you set up a kingdom of a defined number of cards and this is what you draw from to build your deck and attempt to put score your opponent before the game ends. The game is great because while it is simple to learn it is hard to master and the complex interplay of different card mechanics makes the possibilities of combinations and interesting replay endless. My issues with the game are my own and obviously do not diminish the game. These issues include simple logistics, it takes a special insert to organize all the cards in the game now and probably a few rehearsals to set it up and put it away efficiently. This in itself makes me less inclined to play as it takes time to set up and put away AND each new game would require I put away the old configuration and set up the new one. Not the end of the world but not really compatible with what I look for on my regular game store night. Dominion is more a all day multiple plays sort of affair. Also, the theme is generic. This thing is like a stereotypical euro in card form. Bland as butter less toast. These are minor nitpicks. The game is great. I just almost never feel like playing  it.

The classic DBG and one of the best introductory games ever.  My main criticism is the advantage to the player who goes first, the win ratios of players who go last in a 4 player game can't be much better than 1 in 4. It's also pricey and requires card sleeving (or buying a new set when the cards wear out due to all the shuffling).  Other than that it's the default DBG all others are compared to.

After lots of ups and downs, confusion, exasperation, and finally plays with lots of expansions mixed in, I'm finally comfortable bumping this up to an 8.  Not reading about strategy in the forums, I've had to make a bunch of observations and discoveries for myself about how to do well in Dominion.  Now though, I think I better understand how to play in response to what the other players are doing.

Becoming any good at this game has been a struggle.  I'm still not fantastic, but getting the expansions and putting in a bunch of 1v1 lunch games helped a great deal.

Edit: Bumping this up to a 9.  I play it almost every day during lunches, and Dark Ages coming out has upped the fun even more.  It has taken me a really long time to really start to deeply understand this game, but I think I'm getting there.

Edit: With how much this gets played and how much I enjoy it, I can no longer pretend it is anything other than a 10.  It has only reached this level of quality with all the expansions and a great deal of learning, but it has certainly reached it.  This is my second 10 rating.

My gaming group's first deck-builder. When we first started playing, it seemed a bit odd and counter-intuitive. About 10 minutes in, it all clicked, and I saw the brilliance behind the design. You can teach this game to a non-gamer in about 5-10 minutes, and it's a great intro to card-based games.

My wife and I played again with a totally different set of 10 piles to draw from, and the game was even better. The more advanced cards (the ones not recommended as a starting layout in the rulebook) had much more player-to-player interaction and aggression, and we were able to play much more quickly.

I tried to teach my gaming group Netrunner, and it just didn't click. Complaints centered around that game's very steep learning curve and obtuse terminology. Dominion has filled the hole that Netrunner couldn't, and everyone seemed to enjoy themselves. A great game, and a definite buy.

I admit, it's a good game that in a way appeals to me. It's fairly quick and easy to learn as well. There's definitely a lot of replayability. With the differing card powers, there's a certain strategy as you decide how to use your money to buy cards.
My biggest gripe is still the lack of theme. When I played, I just looked at the powers and didn't even care about the picture. So, basically, it's pretty clinical and will appeal to those who like figuring out how to do things efficiently. It's more of a filler game to me than a real game where I can immerse myself for hours.

One of the things I love is the speed of the game... We'll see how Intrigue slows this down with added interactions...

+ Lots of different card interactions to find here; It's fun to build up good combinations and to execute them with a good draw.
- Once you've seen the cards and decided what you're going for, the game pretty much plays itself.


Why it's previously-owned:
Android has put out a pretty slick implementation of this game on their phones. I would much rather play through this game in 4 minutes with zero shuffling than play the real game. 
I traded this away for Colossal Arena and Pergamon.

Near perfect for what it is. As it invented a whole genre of game it's hard to give this enough credit for ingenuity. It's still the deck builder I prefer. Pity it's not more themed, so playing it is playing a game for the mechanisms not story but the mechanisms are SO satisfying.

Played with Intrigue, Seaside, Alchemy, and Prosperity expansions, never all at the same time.  Rating is 6 for base-only, and goes up to a 7.5 if you include multiple expansions.

Enjoyable with tons of replayability, but due to the sheer randomness of draws some layouts simply were not fun, and others were a ton of fun but ended really quickly.

I like the game, but the sheer cost of reacquiring all the expansions, and my not enjoying the game without them, means I will not own this again.

Amazing mechanic of making your deck as you go and reacting to what other people are doing to include counter strategies. Already legendary, it is Dominion.
Theme is there but replaceable but am happy with the theme visually. Also,the fact so many expansions are out there for the game makes it expensive if you were looking for a complete set. One of the few games I play mostly for the mechanics over theme.

This game has turned my opinion of deck-building games completely around.  I agree with others who commented that play lacks interaction (this is not to say the players don't interact - my group had a good time playing this together - only that your strategy focuses less on forcing your opponents' actions than on guiding your own).  However, I like puzzles, and while I am not a fan of puzzle-race games (this breaks the mold on that for me too), the balance of decisions, luck and weight is just right for this game.  Will I like it forever?  Maybe not.  Do I like it for now and see myself playing it at every opportunity?  Most definitely.

Great concept but requires expansions for longevity.  The base cards get old pretty fast and the perk of Dominion is the sheer variety of cards available to play with.

Dominion is my favorite deckbuilder.  It was a fun game at first but once I realized all the potential of engines I discovered this game is much deeper than it appears on the surface.  A great game for anyone to a casual gamer to someone who likes complex games.  The expansions only make it better and add more variety.  I highly recommend this game.

I've played this many times on BSW and finally got a chance to play the real thing. It's a great game with a really interesting mechanic. It plays fast and you can employ a huge variety of strategies. My only problems with the game are that the various money denominations -- copper/silver/gold -- are all uniformly copper in colour, some of the artwork is terrible (the militia card is atrocious), and the back of the cards is a horrible blue colour with an awkwardly placed double logo. I'm sure that this game will see many card expansions, but I wish instead for a second edition with proper artwork and card backs.

RATING: 6
Lowered rating because, after some number of games, the game feels too one-dimensional and monotonous.  The main problem is that, whatever you do, the game is in the end all about money, namely (in most set-ups) raising that $8 needed to buy a Province.  I feel that this game is very surpass-able by later DBGs, just like Magic: the Gathering was very surpass-able (and had been surpassed) by later TCGs down the line.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
CCG deck building without all the CCG ugliness.  25 action cards mean lots of combinations, lots of replay.  One complaint is that an unmitigated Chapel deck destroys.  However, it's still an excellent game and, if the Chapel really bothers you, don't put it in!

We usually draft the majority of the action cards (e.g., draw 2/3, keep 1) and use a veto system for the remainder.  Usually works well.

I love this game!  Plays quick, fair bit of strategy, and the luck factor can be mitigated (to a degree) by your strategy.  Luck still plays a big role, but as with [GAMEID=28143] a skilled player will generally win (or is more likely to win) over a lesser-skilled player.

Rated a 9 instead of a 10 because I've lost interest in it.  I'll gladly play it if someone else suggests it or wants to, but it's nowhere near a "must play" for me anymore, and I feel as though I have a good handle on strategies.  I win around half the time and almost all of my games are 3-4 players.

Give this one a shot and see if it scratches the itch for you.

By the way, for all Dominion I've grown to prefer an even number of turns and phantom Provinces on the last turn (if the Provinces run out then).  It evens everything out and reduces the otherwise significant advantage afforded by turn order.

Without the Prosperity expansion, the biggest thing Dominion has going for it is that it plays fast.

RATING: 7
At first I wasn't too impressed by Dominion. Maybe I set my expectations too high due to the high praise that this game gets. However after multiple plays I've come around to it a little bit.

My biggest problem with Dominion is still its graphic presentation. The artwork and the graphic design are just awful. Why did they even bother hiring an artist if they wanted to publish something like this? Besides that though, Dominion offers quite an interesting game play and constitutes a clever mental exercise.

It's enjoyable to study what's available for you to buy and find the best synergy to exploit. I really like making combos and this game definitively allows you do that. It's very satisfying to get a big turn and cycle through half of your deck.

Yet, maybe because I played other and more refined deck building games before Dominion, I'm not really enhammered with this one. It's a good game, plays quite fast and offers an interesting challenge. However the artwork is really off-putting and the theme makes no sense at all. There's no doubt Dominion is a great innovative title that brought us a whole new genre of boardgames... but it doesn't particularly excite me.

FAVOURITE GAME - This is a light, fast paced deck building game, where you have to build up your own dominion. You have to collect territory cards (province, duchy, etc.) which will eventually clog up your hand, but give you valuable points to win the game. You have to buy actions cards, upgrade your treasury. A perfect game for family and not very gamer friends.

This is a curious one.  I read someone's comment to the effect that they found it addictive, but not actually fun to play, and I think I know what they mean.  I enjoy it, fair enough, but I think I'm in a rut strategywise, and I don't really enjoy it enough to play through that to the other side.  The first expansion (or whatever) Intrigue made things a bit chewier, but strategy for this game is mostly a puzzle I haven't tackled yet.

Update: bought it for my kid, and having a lot of fun now.  With many more games we've passed through the 'Silver rules' period and are happily having a ball.

Update: Okay, okay!  It's a classic of the modern age.  Lots of fun.  I've enjoyed the whole ride except maybe Alchemy (hard to tell because my group doesn't look as though it's ever going to get to a second Alchemy evening).

An innovative game no doubt but the base set lacks replayability. 

I don't mind Dominion, but it is really, really fiddly for what it is. Setup is not negligible, and shuffling is hard for some people. 

I find this devolves into multiplayer solitaire more than any game I know.

I love this game! It has so much versatility and ability to change. There's a lot of strategy, and while there isn't as much chance for sabotage, the fact that you're playing semi-solitaire lets you better use the cards for your own doing. It's a very "in your own head" kind of game, but it's tons of fun, and really gets your brain whirring. Definitely a favourite, and it never overstays its welcome as it plays quickly. It's also much easier to pick up than it would appear.

RATING: 8
Very brilliant and innovative mechanic with the midgame "deckbuilding" as you play.  Between nearly equally skilled players, performing a similar gameplan based on the available cards, it seems heavily dependant on the strength of one's early draws.  That is, if the cards you buy during rounds 1 & 2 are drawn quickly in the second pass through the deck, it tends to be very strong, but if they are in the bottom two cards, and not drawn until the reshuffle, then you get 'screwed' out of one use of them, plus the powerful card they wouldve allowed you to buy doesnt get to be in your deck for the 3rd passthrough.

When playing live (not on BSW), the shuffling can be annoying.  Playing online is extremely efficient and is a superior way to play, imo.  My rating is a '10' for online Dominion due to automated shuffling.  My rating goes down some when you have 3 and especially 4 players, as there is more downtime.  2 player online Dominion is gaming perfection, imo. :)

Dette må bli årets spill!!! Lærte det i november 2008 i et bursdagselskap for spillnerder. Vi endte opp med å spille dette spillet ca 12 ganger i tillegg til andre spill!!! Siden den gang har vi alltid tatt dette frem ved hver spillsamling. Grunnet til dette er enkel: det er stor variasjon i hvert eneste spill, og det varer i 20 minutter og selfølgelig det viktigste, det er kjempe morsomt. Det er stor interaksjon i spillet. Vi er to stk som samles minst en gang i uka, og da spiller vi dette ca 6 ganger på en kveld. Spillet har noen forslag til spilloppsett, men da kunne man fort bli lei for folk bruker samme strategi. Vi sørger nå derfor for at alle spill er random i forhold til hvilke 10 korttyper vi har med i oppsettet. NB! bruk deckprotector til kortene, da varer spillet lenger!

RATING: 2
I played a couple of rounds of Androminion a while ago and thought it was boring. I felt I didn't give the game a fair shake so I spent some time playing bots on Goko. My opinion has changed from boring to deeply unpleasant.

Basically, Dominion works. It does what it intends to do and it does it well. However it's not what I want and I don't like it. Dominion combines the worst aspects of ccg deck construction with the worst aspects of euro games.

I find the core gameplay to be annoying. It's basically a euro efficiency/engine building game with random access to your resources. I don't find either of those aspects appealing. The cards in the core set are tremendously boring and a lot of the setups lead to even more boring games. Some of them are obnoxious and make the game drag.

The depth comes from deducing the optimal strategy per board and recognizing when the mid and endgames are starting. Many of the boards reward a strong focus on 3-5 cards while the others are ignored. 

Another thing I don't like is that there's no hand management. You deck just vomits cards out and you find the optimal arrangement for them to make it look less like sick. I get that the focus of the game is deck management, not hand management, but I don't like it at all.

All in all I gained an appreciation of the strategy and I honestly got a little pleasure out of the learning experience. I get the same feeling from Dominion that I get from playing time waster games like solitaire Qwixx on my phone. It's fast, repetitive, the decisions are mostly rote, simple, and feel immediately rewarding in an incredibly shallow manner, like grinding in an MMO. I pushed buttons in order and a number goes up. I can see why people get fanatical about it but the decisions it requires are fundamentally uninteresting to me and the act of playing isn't fun and feels ultimately hollow to me.

Really don't know what the fuss is all about here. It's a well designed and clever game, but nothing particularly special.

I play it as a filler, so it's a good game for that.

Enjoy that there are multiple decks but only 10 selected for each game which gives a feeling of freshness to each play.

Limited interaction makes the game feel like multiple player solitare at times.

Good game to introduce people into gaming. Simple and quick to learn, addictive gameplay, and deep strategy (no big money is not the best play. its ezmode but can be easily beaten). And you can do some crazy things, for example in a 4 player game the other day I was able to build a 19 card deck that bought a province every turn by drawing the entire deck. Easily blew the competition out of the water.

Another time I just bought every witch I could with no moats in the game I just flooded the competition with village+witch. Came out 20 points above the competition.

Dominion is a fun, fast, light game. The strategy involved can be as deep as you want it to be. With serious gamers, it becomes a race for efficiency and cool combos. With light gamers, it becomes a trial and error process of even cooler combos.

The thing that makes this game great is that it has a face for everyone. I've played quite a bit of this with my gaming group and they loved it. I'm eager to bring it home and try it out with the family. The ease of play and short time span make this a strong contender for purchase by any gamer.

Plays fine for a few games and even has some interesting a deep strategy. Once the novelty wears off though, it's just the spammiest game with a really weird tacked-on theme. Can be decent for introducing drafting games to new players, though much better alternatives exist.

Update 2017: Lowered to a 4 for the following serious four problems that prevent this game from ever becoming great:

1. Buying money is the ultimate strategy in 1st Ed. Nothing beats this strategy. Actions cards are just piddling around compared to buying money until you spam VP.
2. Everyone is able to take the exact same strategy. This is the single most damning factor in the entire game. While it may seem to some people to create interesting back-and-forth play, it doesn't. Everything about the Kingdom stock is ruined by this because players can just copy the best player in the game. You can do this tit-for-tat, or just copy their overall strategy. Most strategies die to THEMSELVES which is awful. Worse, many strategies start a counter-your-counter-which-counters-my-counter-that-counters-your-counter chain. When experienced players see this, it just turns off like half the Kingdom stock (boring) and when newbies play, they cause the entire situation to go nuclear and force everyone to start that awful counter chain.
3. Terrible cards in 1st Edition. Mostly it's the attacks and Woodcutter. Jesus christ these make for shitty games where you're taking subpar cards to just be mean. Ultimately, with good players it just means -1 kingdom pile for every one of them you add.
4. The randomness is stronger in this game than Star Realms which seems impossible at first. Except that most stuff in this game is super tight and your opponent can just copy your exact strategy so if they happen to do that and get the correct cards in the correct order before you, or while you don't, you just basically lost to a luckier version of yourself. I cannot reiterate enough how much every player having the same strategy brings Dominion down. This would be fine in a co-op game but utterly broken in a competitive one.

When I first played I loved it. Now I give it a 7.5. It is a definitely well designed game highly enjoyable over time. However, cards game are not my favorite and thus I don't play Dominion that often. Sometimes you might get combinations of decks which do not really go along together  and thus once you learn a few strategies you may happen to repeat them almost automatically.

If someone suggests to me that we play Dominion, would I say, "No"? Well, I'd probably never turn it down. Would I suggest playing it? No: it's quite a good game, and I like it, but there's too many things lacking in it that would make it a game I love, as opposed to merely like.
By the way, Dominion weirdly reminds me of Fluxx in the way the cards interact with each other: Fluxx with a deep and meaningful strategy, mind you!

Good game but more I play Star Realms, I prefer Star Realms due to the more direct player conflict and various faction cards to plan with. 

Maybe with more of the expansions that I have played at friends' it would increase a bit more.

However, is an excellent game... I think it is also that it is easier to pull out Star Realms than the bigger box of Dominion :) when it is just hubby and I playing...

RATING: N/A
In Dominion, each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards. In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can "buy" as they can afford them. Through their selection of cards to buy, and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I like the various combinations of available cards that interact differently in every game. Dominion created this whole deck building formula, and did a great job with it in my opinion. Its strength is in simplicity while the depth is in exploring the variability with weird/interesting combos. But it can come across as a bit dry or lifeless depending upon how you approach it. So you either enjoy the game for what it is or you don't. 

Unfortunately, the base set is what it is. The options are pretty limited and get stale pretty quickly. On its own, the charm fades quickly. Expansions definitely help bring it back to life. But they come in varying quality.

This game (with expansions) blew my mind! I know there are other deck building games out there, but I'm not drawn to them. The fact the theme is relatively superficial is not a problem for me; in fact, I like how abstract it feels. (One exception: it is counter-intuitive to spend "money" and then put it back in your deck, which impedes learning the game, imho. It would make more sense if it were a Gold Mine rather than a Gold.)

Fine, but later deckbuilders are more interesting and I don't care for the ones which require you set out a bunch of decks. I prefer a rotating market of a wider variety of things.

And in total, personally, I'm finding that I don't love deckbuilding as a mechanism. I like constructing a deck, ala Magic, but none of the deckbuilders which I have played have yet really captured that sense that I'm creating my own personalized deck that's AWESOME, and then test it against my opponent's awesome creations. Instead, and I assume this is the fault of Dominion, it always feels like I'm playing a Euro-style board game with the limited goal of upgrading the things in my hand, rather than building a "thing", and that I'm largely playing a solitaire game for point comparison.

And since Dominion was probably created with the intent of giving people a bit of the sense of constructing Magic decks, that it fails to achieve that is a pretty strong demerit. It, ultimately, failed to accomplish its goal.

My initial reaction to Dominion was one of sheer excitement and fascination. Being a hard core Magic player, I was intrigued by an idea for a game where the sole purpose was deckbuilding, and for a time it was amazing. Now that enough time has passed, and I have played other deckbuilders, going back to Dominion I have a new perspective. If you have never played  a deck builder and you want to see the bare bones of how the concept works, then this is the game for you, its the original and without the expansion it is streamlined and classic. Otherwise, there are far better deckbuilders out there and this one's crown has been passed.

2-4(3)

UPDATE:  This literally never hits the table and probably won't.  I'm half keeping it around because I think it'd be great for when non-gamers (sis, cousins, ...) are around.  I've played with them and while they got into it and "got" the game well enough, I didn't feel like they were all that engaged.  And I wasn't all that engaged.

I think the base benefits greatly from Seaside (and perhaps additional expansions), but I can't but think it's similar to Blue Moon in that most of these abstracted / shallowly themed card games just aren't my thing.  I just can't care enough to connect the cards to the mechanic (which to me is only so-so).  Again, except for, oddly, RftG.

I'm not usually one to trade out, but seriously thinking of dealing away my set.

---------------------------------------------------------

It has some interesting mechanics and I can appreciate the play but the theme is so thin I don't get invested in the game.  I don't care about the cards aside from their stats (and some cards seem clearly much better than others), interaction is low and it too often seems to be a race for provinces (after being a race for gold).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It is fun to try to find synergies among the cards, and the constant reshuffling mechanic is quite clever. However, Dominion is at its core just not very interactive. It feels a bit too much like racing another person in solitaire.

I only have the main set, the cards of which tend to be quite vanilla. The expansions may well offer a more complex and interactive experience.

Engine building meets Magic-style deck building.  Decisions on timing your switch from building that engine to gathering victory points are familiar from St. Petersburg. 

Player interaction is low to non-existent, depending on the set-up you choose.  Some of the cards like the Militia, Thief and Witch introduce take-thatery.  It would have been nice to see some more imaginative options for interaction, but perhaps those will come with the inevitable expansions.  

Update:  I have recently played several games using random set-ups of cards from the base set and various expansions.  It strikes me as a better game when that great level of variability is accumulated.  However, I am never going to make the huge investment required to reach that point.

Once this game is played, it goes to the shelf for several weeks. I'm afraid the re-playability isn't as high with this game, and the flame or passion for this game is in a tiny cold drafty room.

RATING: 6
Most of my friends and family love this game and I end up playing it more than I would prefer. So I'm able to isolate the core problem: only some combinations of cards are truly strategic in that they have multiple meaningful strategy branches. In other words, it feels like in 50% of card sets it matters much more that a given player gets lucky early and gets one (or sometimes several) key cards then what happens after that point.
--------------------------------------
INITIAL: I simply don't get this game.  I don't care in the least if I win or lose (very abnormal).  It's not interesting to play, it's not interesting to watch.  And my friends all think it's fantastic and that I'm crazy.

Played often for a few days when I first bought this game, but its appeal has faded somewhat since. It's fast, and varied thanks to the selection of kingdom cards that make up each game. However, the game seems to be in the strategy one decides to take when looking at the selection of cards in any particular game. There don't then seem to be many decisions to take: one buys according to one's strategy, though there are some decisions to be made there. But actually playing each hand, before the buy, rarely seems to be interesting.

...

After some plays of Intrigue: Intrigue makes playing each hand more interesting, there are a lot more interesting decisions to make in how to play one's hand. So I see a lot more life in this now, and have more enthusiasm for it. Still won't ever be my all-time favourite game, but much improved in my estimation.

...

[July 2010] I played it once the other day, and thought: I don't like this game...

I love this game immensely, after over 1000 real and online games, it still holds my attention.

So very, very clever, yet so fundamentally simple in implementation.  Infinitely re-playable with so many variations.

Clever.  But when combined with the Expansions, it really becomes special.

I've never encountered a game that so thoroughly dominates a table.  My work colleagues and I play this at lunch, almost every day for over 12 months.  Even though I have tried to introduce other games, they always insist on playing Dominion.  And now I have both Intrigue and Seaside, the possibilities are endless.

The ex-girlfriend I occasionally think of longingly until I look at my current beau (at the time of this writing I would say Thunderstone) and remember why I left her. Such an incredible game, that so many games owe everything to, with no theme whatsoever. I also got tired of how much time I have spent watching people combo draw through their entire deck. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The mechanic in Dominion is quite unique, the idea of building a deck of cards as the purpose of the game is interesting and offers a lot of space for re-play.

One of my favorite thing about Dominion is that every time I play, I have to come up with a different strategy (even with the same 10 Kingdom cards), because the opponent(s) also have different ways of playing. I also like the fixed start and even though the game is quite scripted in the beginning, I like the fact that you're able to employ any strategy.

The quality of the cards and the amazing box interior offer a great play experience.

The learning curve is very good, in less than 20 minutes, almost all option the game has to offer and all the mechanics are clear.

The only down side I see so far is the master strategy for two player (which I will not disclose). Until someone will prove me wrong (by defeating this strategy, I will not rate this game higher, although it has the potential for 9 or even 10.

RATING: 7.5
the .5 is based on assumed replay value with the expansions... like the game, Don't like waiting for others to cycle their decks.  like the random board (cards).  Like that sometimes it's interactive and sometimes it's solitare, you never know.  Like that even when it's not my turn I watch what others are doing and fret over it, so that I usually feel engaged even with non-interactive cards.  Can see it getting old, but not for a while as the people I play with have big boxs.

Update, played with a few of the big box expansions and while prosperity makes cycling your deck easier and thus turns longer, variablity trumps the offset of waiting...usually.  Still a fun, accessable game.

Although the cards themselves are nicely illustrated, at first glance it does not look the most playable and exciting of games. The original game comes with 25 kingdom cards, from which 10 are (best randomly) chosen. This makes for some varied and interesting games where tactics change from game to game. Unlike the CCGs where too much is dependent on preconstructed decks, players construct their decks from the same pool of cards and play as the decks become larger.

It might not be as flashy or thematic as deck builders that have come after, but there's just something magical about Dominion that is hard to explain.  I've played nearly every deck builder released in the past few years and have yet to find one that I prefer to Dominion.  Again the fact that I don't think I'll ever play the same game twice is a huge plus.  Also this game is AMAZING as a 2player dual, quick and fun, and my wife and I can blaze through several games in an evening and have an absolute blast.

RATING: 7.6
A card game, with infinite replayability, even without the expansions, none of which I have played.

The mechanics are simple and the game has a very short learning curve.

What makes the game infinitely replayable is that there are two or three dozens different types of cards to choose from, but only ten are used per game, drawn at random.

For me, 7+ is a high rating for a card game.

May 2012:  This game actually earns a 10 for addiction.  I can think of few games more addictive than Dominion.  

Clearly, the mechanic of always trying to "improve" your hand,  shuffling through cards, then playing them, is a highly addictive pursuit (witness the Magic phenom).  I find it strangely intoxicating as well.  Interesting. 

This game is a definite phenom, a bestseller, and an excellent gateway game.  It deserves major props for helping to introduce a lot of new people to board gaming.  Rating 7 of 10.

February 2013:  Just no desire to play again. Dropped to a 6 of 10.

My first foray into deck building games, and Dominion has lived up to its name for me. Great game with a massive amount of variation once you start mixing in the expansions. I love how it balances having useful cards in your hand vs critical-to-victory-but-functionally-useless cards. 

Certain combos can be broken, but nothing that some personal black listing won't solve.

Some people also diss the theme or artwork. Personally I find the artwork okay (except Intrigue). And as for theme? I would take a great themeless game over a poor thematic game any day.

Time really does wear Dominion down, along with the unfortunate flaws of 4-player games.  I believe at this point you could find better alternatives in the same vein, and ones that don't require bi-annual expansions ...

Dominion is an awesome game the began a genre. Vaccarino would seem to be a genius for coming up with deck-building. Though we do feel sorry for him. He created this epic game that has defined an entire genre of game that will not go away. Thus he will be forever judged by that epic creation. And he will never be able to match it much less surpass it. 
That said we just cannot see keeping it. We have so many other deck builders that are better and with theme , something Dominion is sadly lacking in. So while it is an incredible game it isn't for us.

No es un mal juego, diría que hasta divertido en las primeras partidas. Más adelante a mi me resulta demasiado repetitivo, aunque esto es una apreciación personal.

En cualquier caso creo que la aberrante cantidad expansiones y de juegos prácticamente clónicos han agotado el modelo por completo. Aunque en su día resultó una idea muy novedosa.

Not only is Dominion fun, but it only takes five minutes to teach to someone... even if they are not someone who normally plays boardgames or cardgames like this. Variety thanks to random decks or preset builds makes it so that this one will get alot of plays before it gets stale. Thankfully, the quick playtime will ensure that this one gets brought to the table VERY frequently. (Plays include those on isotropic.com)

1/20/13: Got around to updating my rating on this to 6 (from an 8). Dominion has really cooled its jets on me lately. I have no desire anymore to play it as other deckbuilders have passed it up in terms of theme and entertainment. I would much rather play Legendary, Ascension, Epic Thunderstone, etc... Dominion is a great game for someone new to the hobby and deckbuilding in general... but its time has passed IMO.

A lot has been made about its "broken" qualities... Perhaps the game is better with expansions but the core set leaves a sour taste in your mouth after you start getting the hang of it. I'd recommend Race for the Galaxy-much better game in terms of the "core" set of cards. Loved this game initially and it quickly faded. Race for the Galaxy on the other hand, was the opposite. Had to get past all the poorly designed iconography-took about 2 or 3 play throughs at which point I started seeing the numerous card combinations/strategies and really started loving the game.

There is a whiff of brilliance here, you can just feel it.  Actually this game is VERY popular, who am I kidding.  Many people will testify to the sheer genius of this game, the level of strategy, the decisive choices one faces, mathematical madness and all.  And Dominion is really for the concrete math mind, it isn't very themey or artistic, in fact it is rather numb for a card game.  And that is why I primarily take issue with it.  Although I will not doubt its brilliance, mainly the whole active deck-building play.  And many great spin offs of this mechanic are popping up, if Dominion wasn't your thing.  Still this game is easy to learn, has many ways to play, and has many details and tactics for mastery.  Well done.

Dominion alone is not amazing as it's replay value will greatly diminish. However when you start mixing it with the millions of expansions it's replay value shoots through the roof. Very fun. One of those games I'll pick up every couple months and play a ton until I burn out on it for awhile.

I do like the way your card pile grows, but this CCG-style game introduced me to a second meaning of the term "wristy." Here you'll be shuffling your personal deck every two minutes, playing cards that can "chain" so you keep drawing more and taking more actions (while everyone else just watches), until you are finally left with money cards and "dead" cards and get to buy another card (action/money/VP card). It's very random, and there is almost no interaction or fun factor, let alone excitement level. I played two games and that's enough.

A lot of fun, and I keep playing it.  It plays quickly and smoothly, the deck building aspect is unique, and the random setup of cards keep each game interesting.

The only drawback is that the game is a bit filler.  There's a lot of luck involved -- even going first is a big advantage.  So I can't take the game as seriously as I would like.

Play actions, buy cards, draw cards, build a deck.  A very simple game once you boil it down to the basics, but it makes for a very satisfying game experience.  The system for choosing the kingdom cards to use in the game is perfect, and I think the preset ones create some very fun, balanced games.  A VERY well done system.

Initial rating after 3 games.

PROS:
-) Plays quickly - you never wait long for your turn
-) Different decks make for a different game every time
-) Seems to scale well with different numbers of players
-) Small, but interesting decisions
-) Building the deck really gives me a feeling of achievement (it's getting better and better)
-) Neat box

CONS:
-) Bound to become a bit repetitive over time - but I still have MANY games before that will happen
-) Some turns are fairly obvious, and play semi-automatic

It's a good game with quite a unique system of play. I enjoyed it but I didn't really feel any excitement when playing it also the theme is really thin to the point where you don't care which is a shame as the art is very nice.

After a third game I found I still enjoyed it. It's clever and different. Still not much "joy" when playing.

Fourth game and I'm starting to like it a bit more. With people who have played the game a lot I'm sure it becomes very fast as there would be little downtime due to you being able to draw cards and know exactly what to do with them.

A few more games and ...Nope. Don't like it. It feels that there should be more to it. I'm not good at this sort of game and can't be bothered getting good at it. If only it felt like I was actually doing something rather than shuffling cards and getting more cards to shuffle. Where's the fun?

RATING: 7
The standard when it comes to deck builders. Very interesting decisions that are made each turn, trying to find the perfect balance between action cards and currency and knowing when to make the push for victory points. Very good replayability, but only when included with an expansion or two. Really, if you invest in one Dominion box, you need to invest in least one or two more.

One downside is that some cards are clearly better than other cards of the same cost, which creates a mad rush of grabbing as many as you can before your opponents can. Some cards are left untouched because their cost isn't worth their benefit compared to other things you can buy. Also, the game lacks interaction and feels sometimes like everyone is just playing their own game.

This is the grand daddy of deck building games and it has so many expansions that even if you are a seasoned player it is still fun to play because of the variability of the cards.

RATING: 8
Thought it was a game of modifiers when I first glanced at it, glad it didn't play like that.  Didn't immediately get the "just one more" crack feeling of Race for the Galaxy either, even though I'm not the biggest RFTG fan.  Good variability.  Printing the helper thing from BGG that sits in your insert makes setup a lot easier.  Many decisions, very playable, also plays great with two.  Really hit its stride for me with repeat plays against fast, experienced players.  Enjoy playing it on BSW as well.  I've come to really dig it as gaming candy, although competitive patterns (especially the chapel) took it down a bit after tons of plays.  I think the base game's shuffling is acceptable, but I'm less interested in expansions because of shuffle-mechanic cards.

Played a few times, excellent game as far as replay. Some of the cards do seem signifgantly more powerful then others though, and we found requiring moats anytime there is an attack card is needed as well.

I think after playing this game even more, while at times it seems certain cards are almost useless, othertimes those cards lead to winning strategies. Overall I think that the game is very good, and one of the fastest, most replayable I own. Giving it a 10!

At first, this game was compulsively playable; everywhere, it's what people wanted to do. It dropped off the radar faster than any popular game ever has, with the possible exception of Agricola. I played dozens more games than I have logged here, and even the promo cards and expansion couldn't convince me to try it again. Ended up selling the game to finance my purchase of The Beatles Rock Band.

Tried for the first time after playing A few acres of snow and Freitag two deck-builders I have. Now I can understand the hype and why Martin Wallace wanted to adapt Dominion mechanics and make a much thematic version of his own. 

Lots of combinations in the base game (23 Kingdom cards just using 10 of them in every game and depending on the choice games can be significantly different) and though it could get stale if you play it a lot you have loads of expansions that you can add to the mix!

I'm playing a computer homemade version based on MWS and developed by my friend Ordoniez so I can just play two player games ... but it's still great! Keen to explore all the expansions.

Well, I succumbed to the hype and after one play I enjoyed myself. Bought mainly for my wife, I hope we both take to this, because RftG and Bohnanza (her favourites) have lost that lovin' feeling with me... I need some time apart from them :P

I am intrigued, I put together a five action combo that impressed me - not being impressed with myself, just that the game can give some fun and unexpected mixes even to a scoob.

2 more games. Everyone is right, this game is fun - lasting fun? I don't know, but definitely initially fun. I figured out some of the economisation of cards - eradicate coppers and 1VP cards as early as you can, then trash less powerful (cheap) action cards later. I hope there are more strategies awaiting me.

No game has ever garnered such interest.

Fast and fun.  Easy to teach.  

This game will seem like a rollercoaster - at first it will be tons of fun getting used to what the different cards do.  Then it will seem like it's too simple.  Then you'll begin to see some of the really subtle parts of the strategy behind building a winning deck.  No matter how many times I've played a set of Kingdom cards, I always have fun.

This game is just plain fun!

Rated this a 7 at first then rethought my rating. I realized that i never actually interacted with any other players only against myself except for the occasional card that forced others to draw, I was only in a race to build as may victory points and have the highest total. Whats odd is i like Ascension... but this felt bland to me. Maybe it was the theme.

I got the Dominion game for my IPAD, and my review went up a little as i am learning the game a bit more.

Not my first choice in a game but I may give it another play.

Ok this game went from  a 7 to a 3 back to a 6. Had fun at a recent friendly tournament. Willing to bring this out in that type of multi game environment. As a anchor game , not to sure.

Traded. While I respect Dominion for its innovative mechanics, I didn't quite enjoy playing it in person. Long setup/packing time. Hard to carry around.

Overall, fun solid game but didn't enjoy enough to keep it.

LOVE LOVE LOVE!  One of my guilty pleasures is playing card-based games courtesy of my sons.  I used to play Duel Masters with them and Kingdom Hearts because it was a great way to bond.  What I love about Dominion is that all players start on a level playing field so it is not just a competition of who lucked into a rare & powerful card find or who spent the most money buying card packs to fill their deck with the strongest cards.  This games lets everyone start from the same point and how you build your deck is entirely up to you.

I love this game and it will always have a special place in my heart...this was my gateway game to a new age of board games.  My friends are always sceptical when I bring it out.  It looks daunting at first but with a little bit of simple instruction, it hits a rhythm quickly, plays fast, and we rarely play it just once.  Wonderful support in terms of expansions and I have bought them all.

I love the concept of a deck building game.  Several of my friends love this game.  I could not get into it.  It felt like I was playing solitaire.  There is very little interaction between the players.  It is just a race to get points.  You might as well sit by yourself and see if you can win/clear the pile in less turns than your previous play.

Plays well with 2-4 players, and that's one of the big things going for it.  With 4 players there is surprisingly little downtime.  The downside to this game is the shuffling.  I have seen custom sets with discs used rather than cards and that may be an enhancement.  I'd like to try that.

For some reason this just isn't grabbing me the way other games do.  Intersting, but not compelling.

3/7/09 - Bumped up to a nine.  Still not compelling me as it is with some folks that I play with, but any game that's getting this much play gets bumped up in the rankings.

I absolutely love Dominion. I enjoy deck building and engine building, and I think that Dominion does both of those excellently. I have played with a couple expansions, but most of my experience is with the base game. I love finding synergies between sets of cards that can give me an advantage over my opponent. I also love that the game plays so quickly. I used to play a little Magic, and I enjoyed the deck construction aspect of the game but didn't care for the collective nature of the game. Dominion gives me some of the deck design feel that I sometimes miss from Magic. This is easily one of my favorite games to pull out for a quick game with some fun strategy.

Update: Ultimately, I got rid of Dominion because I couldn't find people interested in playing anymore. I still really like the game, but it wasn't worth keeping around since it never got played.

As long as there aren't attack cards involved the games go quickly which is good. I don't come up with any actual strategy as I play which undoubtedly causes lower scores than I might otherwise manage.
I do like the game just not enough that I'll choose it if I'm choosing what to play.

2010-04 I've read more of the strategy/review articles here and stopped buying as many action cards. I also started making use of the trash ability when it was present.
Unsurprisingly I've started scoring better, winning more than my 'share' of games.

RATING: 6
Undeniably well designed for what it is.  This being not more than a 6 is due mostly to taste.  To me this boils down to a puzzle game, where the puzzle is finding the best combos and engines per setup.  Puzzle games are not one of my my 8-10 rating range genres.

Within the puzzle-interactive-card game 'genre' I think I'd prefer Glory to Rome over Dominion on depth and thought, in spite of Glory's higher chaos level.  I also prefer Thunderstone's theme integration better than Dominion's, so if I'm going for some base level immersion in this genre, I'll go Thunderstone.  So while Dominion may be technically the 'better' game design of those three on paper in many respects, I like the other two better.

I like Dominion.  The deck-building is applealing, where VPs are necessary to win the game but create dead weight in your deck.  You don't really want to get rid of coppers and reduce the cash value of your deck, but replacing them will increase the average cash value of a hand.  Tough choices, and a good game.

With more and more plays, the uber-combos really start to become glaring.  It often becomes a race to get lucky cash draws to buy up all the festivals or gardens or whatever the hot one or two cards are for that game.  Seeing a player play his entire deck of 40+ cards turn after turn is not fun; it's tedious, even if you are the guy doing it.  Rating decrease!

I like Dominion much more than I usually think I do. The real problem is actually playing it - frequent shuffling, slow player turns, and the occasional mess of bookkeeping keep me from considering purchasing this most of the time - it's also quite expensive to invest in. Isotropic was the best way to play this, and now it's going away.

I'm almost always up for a game or two of this, but I'm quite put off by the concept of doing this with the cards more than, say, three times in a row.

I wanted to love this game.  But I just don't.  I enjoyed it when I first acquired it but it lost its luster more quickly than I'd have liked.   It's all about finding the right combos.  Some of the cards seem designed to only really work with one other card.  Other cards seem completely useless.  I agree with donlyn, it's "a system in search of a game"   I will say though that this game taught me strong deck building and that skill has been tremendously helpful for other games.

Wanted another easy and quick 2player game. Dominion seemed to fit the bill well. 

In the past I've complained about how un-interactive it is, but I'm seeing as I get more and more board game experience that there's something to be said for not causing hurt feelings.

So Dominion does what it does well: It plays easily and quickly, and is very easy to teach. A good substitute for when we're tired of Carcassonne.

The best deck building game I've ever played hands down. Some of the attack cards only slow the game down, and if you have a game where you can't trash cards it's a bit stale. However, the mechanics are simple enough for anyone to play, and the strategy is heavy enough to keep skilled players entertained. If you don't own this game or know someone who owns it, stop reading this and get a copy right now.

RATING: 5
While Dominion isn't the "first" deck-building game strictly speaking... it did popularize the mechanic and for good reason. This game is incredibly simple to play and manages to deliver something fluid, interesting, and highly replayable. The only issue with the game is that some starting combinations (lots of attacks, lots of curses, etc) can lead to some wonky and slow-playing games. But by being mindful during set-up, Dominion can be a real treat.

RATING: 5
The game had lots of hype and recommendations; got it from a friend that was surprised that i haven't played a "pure" deckbuilder.
It has a few shortcomings:
- 1st player advantage 
- the game is too simple
- doesn't feel fun to pull off combos
- half cards are mean- and even then they are boring
- can be too long for what it is , depending on the kingdom cards chosen
- the base game doesn't stand on its own

My SO didn't want to play it more than once; i played two 2 player games, and several solo. All were meh.

TL;DR the game is overhyped, and the mechanic can't stand on its own.

Pues realmente o no sé jugar todavia o es que no me gusta nada. Me parece un fulete de juego. Podemos valorarlo desde dos puntos de vista. Si es para introducir a gente al mundillo...pssss... me puede valer. Preferiría otros pero bueno, vale. Si es para jugones, no me gusta. Le he jugado 8 o 9 partidas y no me convence... Acabo harto de refilear el mazo. Puede ser que me hagas estrategias malas pero es que veo a mis contrincantes que les pasa lo mismo...
El arte gráfico es penoso, la macenica del juego es resultona, pero para eso está Leyenda o Magic... vamos que no. Debo de probarlo más porque no puede estar todo el mundo confundido... Ya no te digo nada de que sea él y una expansión del Top 10... me da la risa. Cómo será que es el único juego que  no me importaria vender de mi colección.

Based on 1 BSW play. I rather enjoyed the game, but it seems like the choices you make are rather obvious most of the time. I love games where choices are not a lot, but to take one route makes you agonize as you make your move. This isn't such a game. I liked how it played, but it's just not that "oh, what I'd do" experience I love.

UPDATE: Having played a couple more times, I can see how this game earns it's huge appeal. It's still not amongst my favorites, but I'm now considering buying it, for the sake of having a medium-weight card game I can actually teach easily (as opposed to the great Race for the Galaxy).

UPDATE: Still enjoying it. It shows it's great replayability, which is always a huge plus for me. I'm considering buying it (despite it's rather steep price), and I'm upping the rating to a 9.

UPDATE: It's a good, fun game, but not a spectacular one. Down to a 7.5, and likely to remain there.

Essen '08 purchase.  Played the first three suggested decks in order.  In the first two the provinces went quickly.  In the third only one all game due to the presence of the thief.  So, a system that will provide many different types of game.  Enjoyable experience.  I look forward to further plays.

Am now enjoying subsequent plays with the different decks.  Value for money.  Good fun when played quickly, otherwise can suffer from downtime with four.  (Also tried with 5 and modified end game requirements, but predictably too much downtime.)

RATING: 7.8
I like the deck building mechanic of this game.  It's a fresh take on what is becoming a very common genre of card games.

There is a lot of talk about there being limits to the number of winning strategies and I can't really say if they are true or not.  It does seem that there is one major road to victory (with only subtle variations).

The game plays pretty quickly though, and is still pretty fun so I'm willing to give it a fair amount of tries before giving it up as one-dimensional.

I will say that Race for the Galaxy (which is similar in many ways) does appear to be the more fulfilling experience of the genre.

-------------UPDATE------------------

This game grows on me the more I play it, and the more cards I mix in.  My initial rating (7) was based on games that only used the base set and only used the same "suggested beginners" set of ten action cards.  The game is much more interesting when using different cards each game.  Expansions add even more variety and enjoyment.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
A simple game, in design and game play. Basically you are trying to optimize your deck and your hand, since you are drawing from the deck you are building.
You are going to be buying from the 10 stacks of cards and adding them to your deck, and then later maybe get rid of cards that become less useful or that clog up your deck, and buying more useful cards.
Plays well with any number of players. I don't like the fact that some cards are rarely picked, so it ends up being the same cards picked up again and again. 
You can always customize the game and leave those cards out but I prefer to have a complete playable game, and not just part of it.
Turns are extremely quick, no AP here.

RATING: 6
Like Magic, but including deck construction as part of the game. Very fancy mechanics that work very well. After playing a few hundert games I prefer Magic again tough...
Found out recntly that I'm not really into it anymore. I will always respect it for having founded a new game genre though.

RATING: 6.5
Excellent filler game.  It may best be experienced in the online format, but still fun to play face to face.  Lots of interesting combos are possible and has some nice light decisions.  It takes a few plays to overcome the "obvious best" strategies to see that there are more paths to victory.

Great game. Probably would have put in in the 9s when I first got it but now it doesn't have quite the same shine after repeated plays. Still solid, it just has more of a dry feel and it can sometimes feel like the strategy is obvious (solution- try not to play with those card combinations). Definitely a game where the expansions are really great. They breathe new life into it.

RATING: 7
+ The card game that defines deckbuilding!
+ Thanks to the good expansions Intrigue and Prosperity, the short playing time and variety in setup, we've played Dominion more than a 100 times. 

- Nowadays however I feel no need to put it on the table. Eminent Domain probably replaced it.
Burned out on Dominion, but it remains in our collection to be taught to the children in the near future.

Tons of replayability in this novel and well executed reframing of the CCG drafting mechanic. My only big concern with the design is the game end advantage given to those at the beginning of the turn order. At a minimum, players should be able to play out the round with the remaining cards in play.

A kezdeti lelkesedés elég gyorsan alábbhagyott, mivel a konfrontatív kártyák nélkül játszottunk mindig, és úgy elég unalmas volt (túl egyértelmű volt a győzelmi stratégia, csak az volt a kérdés, hogy 8 vagy 10 percig tart-e a játék). Az interaktív leosztással viszont egész tűrhető, ennek ellenére továbbra sem tartom igazán jó játéknak. Erősen túlértékelt!!!

I really enjoyed collectible card games for the customizeable decks...but I tend to lose interest as the expense in maintaining them increases (and the variety of cards becomes overwhelming in the deck creation process).  Dominion solves this problem by allowing for variety, but limiting the available mix in any given game to a reasonable number.  However, the constant release of new entries is too much to bear, and too easy to fall behind.  So I won't turn it down, and I enjoy it...but I won't be collecting them all any more.

Deck building is fun and exciting.  Knowing that your hand was fully crafted by you adds a sense of identity to your game.  Easy to learn and offers lots of different play styles.  These are furthered by the expansions.  However, some strategies are too powerful.  It's also a bit lonely considering it's a multiplayer game.  Very little interaction with the others around the table.

The idea of this game is ingenious, for me it's a perfect filler. Also, normally I'm not a fan of expansions but this game is an exception because here expansions are almost incorporated into the very fundamental concept of this game - to have variety of cards to mix them. 25 cards in the base set is not bad for the start, but after dozens of plays it won't be enough, and this game is so good (and short) that you will easily have dozens of plays.

Went from rating this an 8 to rating it a 7. My initial obsession waned after a relatively short period of time. My wife and I played this obsessively when I first got it so I have to give Dominion credit for being an addicting little sucker. The trouble is once we figured out how to build past the Big Money strategy (a wonderful moment of insight I can attribute to the experience of playing and learning this game) each session got a little more boring. I think this is why the expansions are so rampant.

Simply you could say this is a cardgame and of course that's right. In a way it looks like a collectable cardgame, but it isn't. In fact it's an original, easy to understand, strategic game. It plays fast and it's never the same. Could become a real highflyer.

It's very original, it was a trendsetter, but after some more plays I have to admi : this is not my cup of tea : too nervous, too fast.

After a few plays we are liking it. It's clear that there are lots of strategies and tactics to be learned by playing lots more games.

05/12 - Gosh, I wish I had been logging plays earlier. I must have played Dominion at least 60 - 70 times more than listed. There were straight weeks when this got played at least 3 times a day.

07/14 - LeeAnn and I have been playing a ton on playdominion.com. We like the speed at which you can play and we've been trying a house rule to make it actually a game, not a province race. So, now when we play, a certain amount of action cards must be gone before anyone is allowed to buy a province, which actually lets you build a deck and put the deck to work, opposed to getting as much money as possible to win with provinces in 5 minutes.

This is deck building in its purest form and my favorite of them all. I love the randomization of the available cards, and figuring out the best strategy to win each time I play. I love being able to figure out the best combos.

I wasn't following board games at the time this was released, so its revolutionary nature is lost on me. I have managed to play it since I returned to the hobby. Every other deck-builder I've played is simply better (though I haven't explored a bunch of the expansions for Dominion and don't feel a need to).

My rating's a little tentative, because I haven't played this as much as I'd like before I offer commentary—I don't think I've even played with all the cards.  But it has interesting short- and long-term decisions, lots of replayability, and about the right length.  That's a lot to like right there.

I just received the main game for Christmas. The amount of variance is mindboggling, and I'm sure that there are better strategies to implement than I am using, but it's been fun playing. My friends really dig this game and want to keep playing it, so I do too. I almost feel like the game ends very quickly, but it is good because then it's easy to start a new one.

RATING: 6
I'm not a huge fan of deck-building games, but this one is still one of the best I've played. The fact that all cards the players are drafting are available right at the start of the game is much preferred to the conveyor belt of random card draws in something like Ascension, Legendary, etc.

RATING: 9
The good:
Very fun, rewarding game that everyone I've introduced it to loves. The gameplay is innovative, yet still scratches the same itch of CCG's. But unlike CCGs, buy one set (and any number of expansions) and everyone plays out of it, keeping it fair and even, so you invest in having fun, not being competitive.

The bad:
Theme is detached and feels tacked on, not that this detracts from the gameplay. Lots of shuffling. At least with base set, feels more like you're racing you're opponents than playing them head on.

Very cleanly designed and well balanced considering that this is the first deck building game. Easy rule, quick and fun to play but sometimes I feel like playing multi-player solitaire.
This is a good example of the mechanic = game itself, and I'd prefer later deck building games with more game in it in addition to the mechanic. But still the land mark game.

At first glance the stack of 500 or so cards looked impressively awesome.  However, the actual artwork turned out to be lackluster and the gameplay was about as good as a traditional card game.  

I consider Dominion to be filler.  Keep in mind that I am not a cardplayer, nor am I a filler enthusiast.  However, I do prefer Dominion to Magic: The Gathering and Race for the Galaxy.

WHY AN 8.5 BASED ON BGG RATING DEFS? -  This is an "excellent" game, but I don't "always" want to play.  I will recommend it to newbies to games.  It makes for a great gateway game that can provides you with a ton of gaming miles.

Had a friend over this weekend and got to play this for the first time.  Wow!  What a bunch of fun.  I was afraid it was going to take me awhile to get familiar with the available cards so wouldn't know what would work together, kind of like in Race for the Galaxy.  My fears were groundless...I learned rapidly what seemed to work together and was even victorious during my second outing.  I readily see the wide variety of combinations that can be had, buttressing the game's replayability.  I've got to put it on my list for Father's Day.

Not had this long and already logged in lots of plays.  Introduced it to wife and a friend both really like it.  On the negatives there are puzzles to be solved (or solutions to be learned) in which once they are learned you will have a huge edge on your opponents.    Still really like the game, the engine building and the deck building.  The static buy pool (once game starts) and the limit of one buy and one action (unless cards increase) makes this very skillful and unforgiving if you get the wrong cards or make the wrong choices but makes it particularly satisfying when its all done right. Expansions make the game a lot more fun and varied although can lead to combination fatigue where some players can build up to 20-30 card involving turns which for me is less fun.

Tener tantas cartas sobre la mesa me trae buenos recuerdos de cuando jugaba a ST:CCG. Dominio es un juego sencillo de ir comprando y comprando cartas. Pero complejo, porque tienes que balancear el mazo que vas construyendo entre cartas de poder, cartas de valor y cartas de puntos de victoria, que lo transforman en algo más complejo de lo que aparenta.

I'm not actually too hot on Dominion. Part of it is that I hate shuffling. The other part is that I've found that I don't care if I win - I don't see a story and progression developing during the game, so it just feels like I take a bunch of cards, then the game ends, and either I won or I didn't. Not thrilling.

Really good game, especially if you're like me and get a lot of enjoyment of coming up with strategies to pursue ina  game.  Given the changing 10 available cards, it's all about identifying new strategies.  One major downside is that nearly all the strategic decisions happen before you start then you just execute that plan through the course of the actual game.  You may make some slight reactions to your opponents, but that's definitely secondary.

Card game where you continually build your deck as the game progresses.  You win by owning the most provinces (thus victory points).  On the first play I didn't realize the game could end so quickly so I didn't spend enough money trying to buy property. You can throw cards in combination that seem to build on themselves so that gets some good synergy and unpredictability into the game.  All around a lot of fun.

Full Disclosure: I am a playtester for this game. 

Know this: The game takes several plays to really start to shine. I have a fear that the initial glowing reports are going to/may have already created some expectations that will not be fulfilled immediately upon playing the game.

The game, for me, takes some time to get to know. As you play and, and as you try differing strategies and get to know all the cards in the box, that is when the game truly starts to blossom and shine. the first few plays are not likely to make anyone declare it the greatest game ever, but as you play more and the subtle card interactions and tricky plays start to catch hold, well then it really starts to shine.

With experienced players, it can play very fast.

RATING: 5
I tired of this game pretty quickly despite the zillion expansions available for it. I never need to play it again. Had a good run though.

----------

Definitely a solid title.  After about 25 plays, I have little doubt I will reach 100, but have fears about 'optimal' combos.  For example, the Gardens/Workshop combo seems incredibly strong right now.  I have this sinking feeling certain combos will become the 'best' among particular card sets.  Meaning, once players are familiar with all the cards, every strategy will be a slight variation on a key combo.  Then again, I could be completely full of malarkey.

I'm digging it at the moment, but I already know it will not reach top tier status (in my book) like Race for the Galaxy has.

It goes without saying I'm looking forward to the expansions.

Okay, seriously, the group is hooked on this game. And it's NOT yanking my chain. Sure, I play well, but it's getting like Catan. Setup determines course of action. I pretty much look at the 10 cards, determine what I want and then it's autopilot for the rest of the game. Challenge level is LOW. Just gotta figure out how to wean everyone off of this beast . . . there's so MUCH more out there!

Deck building is cool and I love the idea that you can get so many expansions on top of the loaded base game.

I prefer a board and moving pieces.

Dominion is a game built on an interesting idea, but which falls short in execution. The variable setup allowing (or even [i]requiring[/i]) different strategies to be pursued increases the replayability of a game that otherwise lacks depth, though some of the cards are markedly inferior (to the point that there is no reason to [i]ever[/i] purchase them). However, the most ingenious feature of Dominion is the inherent opportunity cost of buying victory points -- i.e., buying VPs actually [i]diminishes[/i] the effectiveness of one's deck, as it clutters the deck with cards that do nothing to further your goal of buying more victory points. This is a very clever idea, but unfortunately it is only really offers an interesting choice when considering whether to buy a Duchy: with 8 Gold, buying a Province is a no-brainer, and buying an Estate is (essentially) never a good idea; this leaves the choice of buying a Duchy (for points) or a Silver or kingdom card as the only real decision. The result is that this mechanism helps to (slightly) slow down the leader, but doesn't create interesting or tense decisions for the players. A pity.

Player interaction is present, but often feels somewhat lifeless. [i]Turn N: "Milita." "Moat." "Moat." {Discards.} Turn N+1: "Thief." "Moat." {Turns over two non-Treasure cards.} "Moat." {Repeat.}[/i] The fact that most actions are fairly simple and require limited decision-making during the turn helps keep the game moving, but it does feel somewhat hollow after a little while. [i]Incidental[/i], even, rather than purposeful -- especially when actions are indiscriminate (e.g., Militia). While it is not exactly 'multiplayer solitaire', the game certainly isn't [i]engaging[/i], at least in comparison to other games. 

The critical fault is that the downtime-to-interesting-decision (and even downtime-to-meaningful-thinking-during-opponents'-turns) ratio is quite high. In other words, there is a great deal of waiting for a turn that generally doesn't offer many interesting decisions, and in many cases simply plays itself. The most interesting decision is made at a high level at the outset of the game: which cards to buy, and in what quantities/proportions. The rest of the game is effectively just a test of how effective that single decision is. In essence, the [i]sole[/i] interesting decision is made at the outset (even if it is a conditional decision: buy 2A:1B:1C, but if opponents buy D, buy 2A:1C:2D), meaning most of the actual play time is essentially clerical. 

Other more minor criticisms are the price tag (quite high given the production quality) and the production quality. I don't need the world's best art to enjoy a game, but [i]consistent[/i] design of at least above-average quality is important, and Dominion is a major offender in this area. Not only are many cards at odds with each other in terms of content and style, but some of them are [i]glaringly[/i] bad -- as in [i]impossible to not notice how bad it is[/i] bad. 

Dominion is a decent game with some very good ideas, but with enough flaws to detract from the experience in a fairly significant way. It is still [-]enjoyable[/-] tolerable (after a handful of plays) as a sort of puzzle, but simply does not offer enough to be a [-]great[/-] very enjoyable [i]game[/i].

First play. After all the awards and glowing praise I thought I should try this but had sufficient reservations to prevent me buying it. After one game I am unimpressed. 

Regardless of the manner in which you expand your draw pile, your options are at the mercy of what you draw. You see your opponant take a card, you take another to counter it or exploit a gap. All assuming of course that the cards fall correctly when you need them.

Again I got a sense of hopelessness, wishing that my killer card combo would turn up but finding that they invariably didn't. Its a game of much wishing and chaos and I really don't understand what all the fuss is about.

Did not think i was going to enjoy this game as i never got in to magic or card heavy games, but it was really fun.  I'd definitively play it again.  The fact that it comes with so many cards the re-playability is tremendous and building your deck accumulating cards was fun.

My favorite deck builder.  Is a fantastic game that at first was intimidating to get into without having people around me who had played it before.  Once I crossed over now I love it.  I got the Big Box, but have not played the expansions that came with it..... same intimidation/lack of knowledge factor ....... plus the base game is so good everytime we sit down and say lets try the expansions, we read some rules and give up and just play the base game.

This is my favorite game for a number of reasons. The game play is not to long and the gameplay is fast paced. There are multiple strategies to win that regularly work. The variability with the number of cards and expansions is basically limitless. A little advice: you will want to try hundreds of combinations of cards and expansions right off the bat. Play the basic set up for atleast 5-10 games. This will help develope basic strategies and play style. If you jump around to much, you will spend to much time trying to remember what all the cards do, the game slows down and you can never grasp any basic strategies. I understand your strategy will change with the different setups but it will be easier to transition when you need to. Buy and enjoy, you wont be disappointed. Even the very casual gamers in our group enjoy this game.

Of the deck builders I've played, Dominion is my least favorite. Too often seems like group solitaire. No desire to own a copy myself. I still get dragged into a game now and then. Always hope there are some conflict cards to have some interaction between players. Otherwise, I just aim to end the game as quick as possible.

RATING: 8
This seems to be pretty solid at first play.  A decent engine game that plays very quickly.  Couldn't wait for my turn, and usually it wasn't that long in coming.  As mentioned innumerable times elsewhere, it has a really nice CCG-deck building feel to it, without requiring the same investment in time (of course, the wide range of possibilities isn't there with only 10 choices, but it gets enough of the flavor to satisfy).  I wonder about the shelf life of any given set of 10 cards, but there are enough combinations that the game as a whole looks to have good replayability.

After resisting the hype, I finally traded for this and am very glad I did. Yes, the theme is very thin and the card art is bland compared to, say, Magic: the Gathering but the game is easy to teach and plays quickly with interesting gameplay and a very high "just one more game" factor. 

An instant "8" and may well be a "9" if it has the staying power everyone else seems to think it has.

I'm giving this game a 7 for now, but based on 4 plays I just don't see this having much staying power, despite the different cards.  Time will tell.

Lowered to a 6 after another play.  As I feared, this game does not offer much replayability for me, even when using different cards.  There just doesn't seem to be many significant choices to make in this game.

Lowered to 5 after 8 plays.  I continue to play this only because others want to play it.  I can't understand the popularity of this game.  There seems to be little choice, and way too much luck.  At least I finally managed to win a few games; not that this helped increase my enjoyment of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
In this game you decide upon a deck construction strategy and that's 90% of the game done in the first minute.

Playing the cards almost always requires no thought. There is usually a "correct" way to play the cards in hand, and the fact that cards don't stay in hand in between rounds means complicated cardplay decisions are thrown out the window.

You find out if your deck construction strategy won after about 20 minutes if you're playing with quick players, but really having a computer sim spit out the results would accomplish the same goal.

So much of who wins or looses depends on the EARLY distribution of cards in the deck. A single clumping of action cards in the beginning can lead to a crucial wasted turn.  In the beginning of the game this loss of tempo is magnified later on.

The win mechanic of buying provinces (first to 8 gold wins) is also not steller. 

Overal: Uggh. A horrible meta card game.
If you want deck construction games then I recommend drafting a game where card play actually matters.

This has proven over the long run to be the family favourite (over 70 plays).  Initial play can be a bit confusing (needs to be explained carefully), but after that anyone we introduce it to enjoys it.  Game still impresses after several years of playing.

I think having an expansion is necessary to add enough variety to this game, but once you have at least one expansion, the replayability is very high.  Easy to learn; appeals to light gamers; can be played with whatever level of player interaction you want.

I fell hard for this game after just one play at Conquest Oregon. It's all but dominated our game time in the last several months, but it's still so good. It's the first deck-building game I'd ever played, and it inspired us to try Warhammer Invasion and Thunderstone.  All three games are fantastic, but the variety of card combinations and strategies for Dominion keep it fresh. I don't anticipate growing tired of this game (or its expansions) any time soon. For the record, the play count on this one should be around 60.

RATING: 8
As a former MtG + various other CCG games I really enjoy Dominion. It has the fun of building a deck and playing the cards without the collecting factor which in CCG's usually means the person who spends the most money is able to get the best cards. 

Dominion is easy to learn and quick to play.  The generic medieval theme without being supported by an underlying story meant that casual gamers can get into it pretty easily. Even my parents enjoy it!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I have played lots of Dominion, as all my different gaming groups have it, and played most of the expansions as well, at least once. Good game but I'm not enthusiastic about it. I think it is best with totally random cards available, preferrably mixed with expansions so there can be unexpected combos and thougher decisions.  I have also played both english and finnish Dominion and oh boy, is it difficult to change into english when you are used to the finnish wordings on cards.

Huippu!. Takana kohta sata peliä, ja silti jaksaa innostaa. Peli tietysti alkaa vähitellen toistaa itseään, vaikka jokainen setuppi periaatteessa vähän erilainen olisikin. Tietyt kortit ja taktiikat ovat kumminkin vahvempia kuin toiset, joten niitä tulee suosittua. Silti korttien sekoittelun tuoma randomius saa aikaan sen, että pelin kulku vaihtelee paljon, vaikka taktiikka saman pysyisikin. Aina ei pysty tekemään mitä haluaa, jolloin pitää jopa järkeillä mitä tekis. Ja juuri tämä saa aikaan positiivisen kierteen: revanssia ja heti nyt.

BSW:ssä vieläkin parempi, koska setuppiin menee vain sekunti aikaa. Livenäkin silti miellyttävä. Jokin parempi "säilytysratkaisu" olisi silti kehitettävä, jolloin setuppiin ei menisi niin paljon aikaa. Korttien pitäisi löytyä aina imiidetli. (17.3.2009)

I love trying to figure out which cards will combine best. I like playing three or four of the same set of cards in a row to try a different way or to tweak if something didn't quite work out right. The game seems to be out of favour with some folks now but it is my favourite deckbuilder and feels more like a whole genre to me than a regular game. I feel it's best to have at least one expanion with it, for the variety. Sure, it may be light in theme, but it is the mechanics I love. It covers so many ideas of deckbuilding in a very clean way that I have serious doubts whether any other deckbuilder will better it for me. We'll see. For now, Dominion is king.

This game can be both great and bad. The kingdom cards you pick can make or break the game. 

So... sometimes the game is a 5, sometimes it's a 10.

The luck factor doesn't bother me the slightest.

I usually dislike when people always use one strategy. I feel as if I were playing against a robot. Personally I usually like to try new stuff instead of simply being a drone (which sometimes ends up costing me the game, but whatever).

To be honest, the base game alone wouldn't deserve a 9.5... maybe an 8.5...  

EDIT: the game is more interesting once you play with all the expansions mixed in... but this leads to a lengthy and cumbersome setup (it takes less time to set up roads and boats), which is the main reason I almost never play this game anymore... such a shame.

My brother-in-law kept talking about how thunderstone was very much like this game and I really enjoyed thunderstone so I ended up adding this to my wish list. After getting it for my birthday it is still one of the most played games I have. Very enjoyable, though I tend to go with a more specific set of cards than randomizing. Too many times when we have randomized have we ended up with a combination that just was not that fun to play. If you have an android phone there is an app on there called Dominion Shuffle which allows you to specify minimums of certain type of cards ie cards that give extra actions or counterattack cards.

The theme feels a bit grafted on.  Seriously, that's pretty much the only criticism I can level against this, the Big Daddy of modern deck-building games.  Figuring out which cards will work well with each other never stops engaging me, and watching a well-built deck kick ass never stops satisfying.  (Nothing brings a smile to my face like realizing that a typically shunned card is, with this particular set of cards, going to rock.)  When I tell people I may have an addiction issue with digitized versions of this game, I'm only half-joking.  Well-built, well-balanced.  Fantastic game.

Novel idea for a card game that you're actually building your deck while playing. In this case it works very well and makes for a nice quick cardgame. Great replay value due to all the different card sets included. Many combinations are possible allthough not all would be good for gameplay.

After repeated plays I feel I must retract my earlier statement that not all cards combinations are fit for play. Each combination provides a unique challenge and some are just harder than others. Nowadays I seem to enjoy the impossible sets the most. I also noted that the cards wear rather quickly and are not of the required quality for the heavy usage in this game.

A very enjoyable game that has a sliding scale of difficulty as the game grows.  I think that is what makes it work for families and non-gamers.  It is also nice that you only play with 10 kingdom cards so you don't have too much to look at or remember.  There is a level of complexity as the action cards start to build upon one another, but with a few games played it will certainly get easier.

I think my favorite aspect is the slow build over the course of the game.  You start with so little, struggling to afford even the cheapest cards, but then you build up your deck and will play a whole chain of cards that allow you to purchase something much bigger.  It is cool to see new players discover this aspect as they complain about drawing no treasure cards and then play one action card after another and end up with enough to buy a Province.  My biggest complaint is that the game advertises itself as taking only 30 minutes, but usually takes us 3 times that.

While I can certainly see the elegance of the design, the game as a whole never has resonated with me. I have always found reasons to play other games. This simply has not held my attention. It seems to work better in its online/electronic incarnation. A game in that format lasts 5 minutes versus a 20-30 minute game in real life with real-time shuffling.

When do I switch from buying the cards to build my engine? What combinations of cards will fit best in my engine? When do I just let my engine run? Dominion asks all these satisfying questions, but ultimately has too little meaningful interaction between players for me to get it to our table often.

RATING: 6
A 7 with expansions, but if you're dropping $100 for a game and 3 quality expansions, it should be good.  The game does have a number of things I dislike about it, though.

I do think the game plays much more smoothly online - which is one mark against it.

Another is that the game quality depends on the set of cards available in the pool, so you may want to discard cards from the set which seem useless.  Some sets of cards are better than others, leading to more (or less) interesting games based on selection.  It's not that uncommon for 3 or 4 of the 10 piles in the game to be ignored.  Additionally, some games can become very "degenerate" with certain combos.

I think I like the game best with 2 or 3 players and without cards that slow the game down, such as cards which encourage drawing lots of cards, so you can draw more cards, so you can draw more cards....

Finally, sometimes it feels like the game is just playing itself.  You've made the initial choices, now you just have to see what you're dealt, and depending on what you have in hand, you know what you're going to do.

In some games, each player follows the same strategy and several cards are ignored.  It always feels ridiculous when me and another player are pursuing the exact same strategy! Or maybe the exact same strategy with the only thing to separate the two of us is the purchase of a single card.  While Dominion is a fun game to play and lots of replayability (with expansions), it will never be as great as a carefully designed game.  The set-up is simply too random.

RATING: 10
Having now played a bunch of the highest rated deckbuilders around, I feel confident in stating that Dominion is the KING of deckbuilders. It is the purest, the most skill based and quite simply the best of the deckbuilders. The randomness in generating a kingdom of 10 cards ensures endless replay value (particularly if you expand the game). The fixed 10 kingdom cards ensures a level of strategy impossible in games like Star Realms and Ascension, which are far more random and luck based due to new cards appearing constantly (I do like those games, but they are not Dominion). 

I feel the urge to deal with some of the criticism often levelled at Dominion:

Criticism #1: Dominion is really played before the game even starts.
Reply: I feel strongly that this criticism is misguided. Yes, you do need to pick a strategy before the game even starts, but in executing that strategy there are a LOT of important tactical decisions like which order you purchase your cards in, when to trigger a shuffle, when to "go green", how to repond to opponents plays, etc. Strategy and tactics are both important in this game.

Criticism #2: The game has no theme.
Reply: This is true. Whether it bothers you or not is a personal decision. Personally, I would hate to ignore an awesome game because of a lack of theme.

Criticism #3: Big money strategies kills the game.
Reply: The strategy known as "big money ultimate" is indeed very boring, but also very bad. Yes, it will often beat the "buy one of every card" strategy, often favoured by newbies, but it will lose to any even halfway decent strategy. Various "Big Money-X" (where you supplement the Big Money strategy with a single type of action card) strategies CAN sometimes be the best strategy. For instance, on some base set boards, "Smithy-Big Money" where you buy a couple of Smithies and no other action cards, is quite strong. Still, an optimal "Engine" that beats Big Money-X can be found on the vast majority of boards - read this for instance: http://dominionstrategy.com/2012/07/30/building-the-first-game-engine/ - learning how to build "engines" is really the heart and soul of this game, IMO - even though sometimes you have to recognize if a BM-X strategy is the best on a given board. Read this: http://dominionstrategy.com/2013/01/21/the-five-fundamental-deck-types-introduction/

Criticism #4: At some point in the game you know that player X will win.
Reply: This is indeed true in some games. Thankfully will usually be over very soon when this becomes apparent.

Criticism #5: The game is multi player solitaire.
Reply: While not completely misguided, you DO have to take notice and respons to what your opponent is doing - not only when playing interactive cards like attack-cards, but also in terms of greening (buying victory point cards).


It has to be said, though, that while this base game is great on its own, it only REALLY gets into its own when you add at least one expansion to it. Basically, you want as many of the expansions as you can justify to buy. I've now bought them all, but you don't necessarily need that. Advice for players looking for expansions: Get Prosperity and Seaside. When you find yourself needing more, get whatever piques your interest, the expansions are all good, although I like Alchemy and Hinterlands the least.

If you're on the fence about this game, go try it out at www.goko.com where you can play the base game for free. Be warned though - it is highly addictive. If you're looking for strategy tips, go to www.dominionstrategy.com. There are a ton of people out there who have played thousands and thousands of games of this - that's how addictive and fascinating a game it is.

I'll track all plays of this as plays with the main game, regardless of how many expansions are added - unless I play only with a certain expansion.

I'm only tracking IRL games of this. I have played a ton of games online of this.

The rating is for the "full" game of Dominion including expansions. I have rated the expansions as well as stand alone supplements.

I loved Magic: The Gathering when I was younger, but got out due to the ridiculous financial investment it required.  My favourite part of M:tG was booster drafts - take some random packs of cards, everybody takes turns picking cards out of the deck, in order to try and build the Best Deck Possible.  It didn't matter how many hundreds/thousands you had invested in your collection, everyone was on an equal footing.  It cost me about $15 any time we wanted to have a booster draft, but the gaming enjoyment was something I never thought would be equaled.

I thought I gave up those good times when I got out of magic ten years ago.

And then there was Dominion.

Now I can booster draft as much as I want, for only a one-time investment.  And unlike the ridiculous rules barrier in Magic, I can explain this game to anyone in ten minutes.  Unlike the huge time restrictions in running a booster tournament, this plays in 15-30 minutes.

Every single time I get together with my gaming buddies, the first game I suggest is Dominon.  A year and a half later, that still hasn't changed.  This is the absolute pinnacle of card drafting games.  It's changing the industry and I couldn't be happier.

RATING: 8.25
What I really love about Dominion is the variability that keeps it fresh and begs for experimentation to try new strategies depending on available cards. I love that it is easily accessible for newcomers with a lot of strategic depth, particularly through some of the expansions. The deckbuilding is brilliant as a gameplay mechanic, and it has been endlessly copied due to Dominion's popularity.

Now for negatives. I think the base game is the weakest set I own. I think it's overly bland without enough room for interesting card interaction. The expansions make a world of difference and really allow the game to shine. I particularly like Seaside Dark Ages. Not necessarily a negative, but certainly not a plus is that sometimes an entire card stack might be ignored if nobody thinks it will be strategically valuable. Another negative I have is the lack of player interaction, but each turn plays so lightning fast that isn't too much of an issue. When you do have interaction it is often through an attack card, which can sometimes (admittedly rarely in my experience) be overly harsh and nasty.

At the end of the day, I love to play Dominion without overthinking it and chit chat while doing so. It's more of a social experience for me than a highly strategic and tactical one. It helps that turns are lightning fast, the gameplay is simple but the cards can be strategically deep, and not having to pay too much attention is one slight benefit of the mostly multiplayer solitaire nature of it.

RATING: 7
After 2 plays, I'm not overly impressed.  The game mechanic is interesting, but our 2 plays with the suggested starter set felt unfocused.  By the end of our second game we had a good idea of what kind of deck we should be going for, but didn't see any purpose to it.  You're really completely ignoring the other guy, and your play mostly comes out of what 5 cards you draw for each turn.

We will try a few other deck combos before giving it up.

Update: played a few more times, and once with the expansion deck.  This is a pretty good, if over-hyped, game.  The key is to not over-think it.  The game itself is hardly more than a filler, and if you take it as such, it's pretty enjoyable.  I don't know if dozens of expansions are really necessary.  I might get Seaside and call it a set.

Interesting game mechanic, quick play time, fun.  It can get repetitive after too many plays, but expansions alleviate that problem.

It is possible to analyze until your eyes bleed to eke out tiny statistical advantages, but that has a very low reward to time spent ratio.  It's best if you try not to take this too seriously (as with most high-variance games) and treat it as just really good filler.

I must admit I was put off by all the hype but, having finally played it, I can say that this is a really great game. It is not really deck-building in the MtG sense, but more like a classic euro-game in card form (with a little added randomness). You have to be careful to build a balanced deck whilst making the most of any opportunities presented and all the while racking up VPs, needs finesse. Very quick to play as well. Will certainly be looking to get more plays in.

Added: After 8 plays rated down a little because the overall shape of the game doesn't feel right. It all seems to be decided in the first few rounds - say the first third - and luck plays a much greater part in that section than later on. After the first third, it is usually clear who is going to win or lose. A really great game needs to keep you biting your nails to the end.

I’m not a huge fan of the deck-building games as they all play the same: get some new cards, shuffle your deck, draw your hand and play it; repeat these actions endlessly.

Nonetheless, I reckon Dominion has been the first pushing this genre’s latest fashion, which means non-collectable, all-in-one-box card games with lots of expansions, and frankly it also plays like a solid game. Sadly though it’s nothing else than a multiplayer solitaire with no interaction among players at all: the frantic speed it’s usually played at witnesses it’s unimportant to wait and see what the other players are doing, since all you really have to do is to learn every card’s properties by heart in order to optimize the many possible combos, without even really playing the game. 

Anyhow, whenever it’s played with non-hardcore players, Dominion surprisingly turns out as a moderately enjoyable - yet boring - game. (November 2011)

[b]Update[/b] - After further playing the game and finding it more and more boring, in April 2013 I deemed it more suitable to lower my rating from 7 to 6.

There is a reason why deckbuilders come and go and Dominion is still held in high regard.  It's simplicity is both it's blessing and it's curse.  While it lacks theme, the game cruises along at a lightning pace.  Trying to figure out the best combos among the random decks is always intriguing and everyone tends to have favorite cards.  Knowing when to bail on building your deck and going for VPs and ending the game gives each game a great sense of pacing.  I know people claim other deckbuilders have killed Dominion, but the rumors of it's demise have been greatly exaggerated.

I liked it better as the game went on. Learning new cards each time, while keeping the game fresh, will annoy me until I know them all. Not sure I'll ever play it that many times to learn them, though. It was definitely interesting. The game ended sooner that we'd expected, because someone told us as we were playing that the -1 cards count as a pile that can run out for the end condition. We didn't know that--thought it was just the action cards--and so we were suddenly in the end game instead of the mid-game.

UPDATE: Played two more time. I really, really like it now. Each game is so different because of the combo of cards, and I'm much faster to figure out what they all are now. Can't wait to play again.

This game is an instant classic. The first time you play it you are so excited by the mechanic, which is so neatly executed. The base game has such solidly designed cards and a lot of replayability.

I am unsure of whether to give this an 8 or a 9. It's such a solid concept, but I am starting to agree with the criticism that after a certain number of plays the game itself is just an extended resolution mechanism. I'm a little Dominioned-out at this point, which is why the rating is a little lower than it once was.

A very cool building game.  It was better than I expected.  It also gets tense if you watch what and when people are buying the point cards.  Looking forward to playing this one again.  Upped rating by one as I have now played with two and played three games in an evening.  You can play it at a breakneck speed to crank through games, you can play it leisurly and chat while you play.  Still lots of fun and still very interesting.

Update-March 09 - Raised to a 9.  Have recently been doing random decks and found I prefer that.  It makes you think about how the combo's will work and how each game will play out differently.  Really a good game.

Update-Feb 10 - It's now a 10.  I haven't tired of it in the least.  It's a game you can bust out 3-4 different games in one sitting with all feeling different from each other.  It's also a game you can play fast, or leisurly without it becoming a drag.  It has reached the ranks of classic for me and has earned it's 10.

After playing a few times I am slowly coming to the conclusion that Dominion is perhaps playing itself too much. Each player's strategy will be fairly obvious and easy to copy without much penalty at that. Particularly two-player games tend to be very even in score regardless of who is doing all the 'work'. With a few unfortunate rounds it is easy to be overtaken in the strategy you developed yourself.

Most of the time, though, the game is intriguing and rewarding. Deckbuilding is simply fun!

The game that started the deckbuilding craze. Great gameplay that plays out very smoothly. With some houseruling you can add a 5th player easily as my group has done a few times. However, without any expansion, the replay value is lacking.

Not usually one for card games, but i'm liking this one more as I play it and learn it more.  I like the speed of play/game.  Hate the shuffle, but it's kind of a necessary evil. The variety of cards (esp w/ expansions, I have Intrigue but haven't gotten to those yet) keeps it ever playable and re-playable. Each new game, with new combo of cards, feels like a new game.  I know people say it gets stale and that deck building has been done better now, but we still enjoy Dominion greatly.

Dominion wore out it's welcome fairly quickly for this type of game.  I think the main thing is that the tactics of playing a hand are so rote that the only interesting thing is creating a strategy.

This would not be dealbreaker, except that the vaunted variability of the setups is far less than it appears.  A number of cards are pretty terrible or of very limited use.  On the other spectrum, certain cards/combinations dominate any setup in which they come out.  Stuff like Witches and Workshop/Garden.  Assuming relatively experienced players, their analysis will likely be similar and it would seem that card draws might be the deciding factor.

I only wish there were more pressure to adapt your deck to your opponent's.  As it is, there aren't many attack cards or strategies that require an overt response from a player.

Expansion cards could shore up these weaknesses, but I haven't heard them spoken about with too much fondeness.

RATING: 7
I think it was a great idea to take the deck-building mechanism of a trading card game whilst eliminating the rip-off aspect of said games. Different games play out very differently because of the variance in the availability of action cards. That said, it is still a game that only partially lives up to the hype. Almost no player interaction, luck of the draw, annoying constant shuffling and a pasted-on pseudo-theme prevent it from being great.

Another game I had been wanting to try and finally did at OrcCon09. It was actually funny because it was Friday 13th, and we were playing Zombinion (re themed with zombies). I think I understood pretty well how the game plays out from just one go, and would love to try it again.

Yuck! We did not enjoy Dominion at all. The art style is very poor and there is no theme or fun in the game for us. There are many other deckbuilding games I would be more interested in over this and I just don't understand the hype surrounding this game besides the innovation of deckbuilding. A bad purchase and glad to have traded it away.

RATING: 8
A very versatile game that's easy to teach non-gamers.  Each game can play drastically differently depending on the cards laid out in the supply pile.  One aspect of this game that I don't like (that some people love) is the opportunity to string together long combos that that essentially allow a player to play his/her entire deck.  Turn length increase dramatically and I find that the game generally overstays its welcome after that.  This can be completely avoided by limiting the number of "+action" cards at the setup of the game.

Classic deck-builder, but suffers due to the "you can do almost anything and still be strategically sound" syndrome. Easy set-up, easy to teach, and good with 2-4 players means it does get a good amount of play. Not the sense of accomplishment of building up a VP engine that something like say Race for the Galaxy provides.

Deserves some of it's fame, but I'm skeptical about infinite expansions, let's see. 

Teresa loves Dominion, that's great! but I prefer playing many other games that I can't bring to the table with her... yet ¬¬

*update*

I'm playing this game way less that I would like to, but my wife is lacking in appetite to play lately and my gaming group prefer meaty games, but I think Dominion it's a great game.

Trying all the expansions thanks to the PC implementation make me glad of only have bought the base game and the Seaside expansion, both are the finest of all of them. The other expansions are too fiddly and worsen the game undoubtedly.

I get that this one is a classic. The pioneer deckbuilding game. I appreciate that and I understand it should be and was very popular in its time. I don't get why it still is. The deckbuilding evolved and there are so many twists to it. So many interesting games with this mechanic. And this one is just boring to me. Most time is spent waiting or shuffling. The concept is great and there is a lot of strategy involved for sure. The interaction between players is indirect and it feels more like solitaire to me. Maybe expansions change it but with so many good deckbuilders I don’t think I want to waste time to see.

The base mechanism has some promise, for a light-hearted, laughter-filled game. However, there isn't much game to go with it in here. You just look at the available kingdom cards, decide what combination you're going for and the rest is just a matter of timing.

Like mentioned in a review, the game can be summed up in 3 steps:

a) if you have 8 coins or more, buy Province
b) if less then 8 but more then 6, buy Gold
c) if less then 6, buy silver or a card that is better then silver, most commonly one that will net more cards in your hand.

There are some variations to it (garden decks, chapel decks), but it's just not interesting enough to hold my interest.

It's not enjoyable (I don't have fun) and not interesting (It doesn't make me think in new ways)

After a third match, I'm not playing this again. Maybe with future expansions they'll twist the game enough to become interesting, but I doubt it.

«Райнер Книция для матыжников». Для одних это должно звучать, как приговор или диагноз, поскольку игра на самом деле суха, механистична и любит счёт. Тем же, кто любит время от времени перекинуться в картишки, поприкидывать, как будут работать те или иные стратегии, да всё как следует посчитать, просчитать и проверить на практике, это же прозвище рекомендую рассматривать, как гордый титул или же знак качества. И рекомендую сам «Доминион».

9.5 --> 10. I realized that I'm always willing to play Dominion, and that will probably never change. This rating is for Dominion and ALL of its expansions together. Each game is a puzzle to solve, and the luck of the draw makes the journey to realize your plan that much more interesting. I prefer this as a 2-player game, but I can't see myself turning down a multiplayer game either. There is so much variety in Dominion and each game is quick. This is a wonderful game.

RATING: 8
Very clever card game of VP collection, using cash cards to buy cards to give you more cash and actions and then finally using the cash cards to buy VP cards, all based around a deck which you have to build and manage. More VP cards dilutes your deck, so timing is critical.

There are quite a lot of different types of cards which are mix-and-matched to form the cards in a particular game, hence giving Dominion oodles of replayability. You can build up some pretty good combo's but you have to get them in to your hand at the same time and that's the hard part!

Much more appealing to me than Race for the Galaxy, so I reckon that it should do pretty well!

It's been said that this game is an original, engaging mechanic in search of a theme and that seems fair. For players who obsess over reaching constantly for the mathematical ideal of optimal play, Dominion is the near perfect game with a clever, elegant system. I'm just not that player. I'm not convinced either that the game has been created yet which is the best vehicle for this game engine (Thunderstone is still not it for me). I can respect the game that Dominion is and understand its deserved popularity, but I play games to enjoy the elements (theme, immersion, narrative) that Dominion just doesn't seek to offer.

I know that is a bold rating, but here's why I don't think any other game will rival my affection for this game. Not only is the game well balanced, has a great sense of variety, and easy to teach new players while maintaining a great depth of strategy, the value of the game not rivaled by many others is its speed.

If I can play a game 6 times in a night vs. one three hour session of Battlestar Galactica, I'm going to take the game I can play fast. If you're bored or losing, it's not long before you can try a different strategy or a different activity altogether.

Rocket power pacing, gentlemen, is the key to a superlative gaming experience.

My favorite Euro.  The hook of having a pool of cards and only using randomly selected cards from the pool is exactly the type of thing that appeals to me.

I have taught this game to almost everyone I know, even non-gamers.  The majority of them love it--it's almost all I play face to face these days.  That might not be such a good thing if I didn't love the game so much.  But I do.

I use everything from the base set to all the expansions, depending on who I play with.  I don't think the expansions make things better or worse; the cards all start to blur into each other after a while and I'm not sure that's a good thing, but variety is always nice.

I've played this 100's of times and I've still not grown tired of it. That could say something about me, but I think it's the sign of a great game.

The perfect score of 10 is not for just the base set though, that one is a bit dull and lacks longevity. (Though they're making some changes in the new releases, I read) Dominion really shines when a few expansions are combined. I own them all, but three or four expansions should give all the replayability most people would ever need. Maybe skip Alchemy(too much on its own) or Adventures(too fiddly) but any of the other expansions are great!

Not much to say here that hasn't been said a hundred times over - easy to teach, simple to play. Haven't shown it to one person yet who didn't like it. Nice variety of cards extends the play so each game is somewhat different. Hope you like shuffling! One of the first few games I owned and a huge stepping stone in introducing my non-gamer wife to the hobby, she loved it. Played with two, three and four players, pretty enjoyable no matter how many are playing.

A nice easy game to learn, but with a lot of depth and replayability due to the interaction between the kingdom cards.  I generally don't want to play it more than twice in a single sitting, but I'm willing to pull it out to start or end off an evening of gaming if nothing better is available.

After 20 plays the shine has really worn off of Dominion.  Yes, the large number of kingdom cards appears to give an almost limitless amount of variety... except for the fact that the game really boils down to the same few things.  Pick a strategy based on the cards in the pool.  Execute it.  Oh, and shuffle until your hands cramp and the skin wears off your fingers.  I understand that there are a few viable strategies available, but it really boils down to being lucky and getting your strategy going before your opponent does (assuming equally skilled players).  I really, really enjoyed this at first, but now I find the game to be tedious and I'd prefer to play many, many other games over this one.  Dropping to a 6.

RATING: 6
15 plays:

A solid and accessible game that feels bland and limited. I love the fundamental game mechanic of deck drafting and altering that draft. But the ways of altering the drafting and gameplay feel dry and administrative rather than inspiring and fun. 

Partly this is due to the theme adding nothing. The art is so lackluster I feel reluctant to recommend the game, because I wonder if other families will take one look at the cards and put the box back on the shelf.

Partly it's due to the minimal player interaction; there are even enough of each type of card for everyone, which means you can't screw each other over. 

But most fundamentally, it's because there is so little anticipation in the gameplay experience. 

There's no "I have this amazing card coming up, can I use it on him in time to cancel his powers and snatch victory?" There's only "I've run my hand responsibly with such and such strategy, let's see how it did." 

That's not an impossible mechanic to pull off -- 7 Wonders, a very similar game in some ways, manages to provide a sense of milestones and increased stakes and at least defensive interaction via taking a card another player wants.

The expansions open the game up somewhat, but not as much as I'd like.

I played a lot and it has great replay value but I recommend some variety in gameplay (play other games rather than this one exclusively).

Update: We played it too much and now I'm a little tired of it. Perhaps if I got more expansions it would help?

First play - December 2008.  Bought January or February 2009, bought second copy around June or July 2009.

My favorite game, and it has been pretty much since I was introduced to it back in 2008.  The only thing significant that I would change is my opportunities to play; they must be increased!

I love the high modularity of Dominion and its expansions.  I love the basic deck building concept of fighting against the inherent randomness of a shuffled deck of cards by controlling what the contents of the deck are and the immediate feedback of what is working and what isn't by way of the repeated shuffles and draws.  I appreciate the relatively light rule set with the relatively deep tactical opportunities.  I appreciate that the game gives me a sense of creativity through competition.

Ideal at three players, terrific with only two, still pretty good at four.  I recommend not playing with five nor six.

There is not much I can say bad about this game.  Some of the cards in the Dark Ages are a bit wordy and have a very if you do this this happens if not this happens sort of thing.  But this was the second "modern" game I played and really enjoy this.  My wife really enjoys this and there isn't too many games she will, openly, on a random day request to play.  I cannot wait to pick up the expansions.  A must buy for everyone!

RATING: 8
Love Dominion.  Played it more than any other game (because of playing online).  The game is well balanced and requires rethinking of strategy with each game based on the deck given.  There is always a strategy, you just have to figure it out and stick to it.
Negatives:  The game has luck with how your cards are shuffled, but that luck will rarely ever negate one strong player versus another player that does not understand how to find a strategy.  It is hard to get the game to the table with players who are not interested in breaking down the cards to find a strategy.
Someone who has figured out some strategies can truly dominate the game.  I always take 1-3 curses in place of starting coppers when playing against people in person.

Rating has dropped due to monotony over time, but this was played more than any other game.

Thouroughly enjoy playing this game with my family.  Easily understood but yet contains a lot of strategy.

RATING: 7
Drawn into game again. Surprised to find I enjoyed the game more than I expected (which wasn't much). I think, in my case, the card mix has a lot to do with how I enjoy the game that results. The game length is very sensitive to this. This game plays best when it doesn't overstay its welcome - it just doesn't have the depth to sustain a lengthy session (and don't ever play with more than four - maybe even three). Maybe the thing is to only play it once in a while to bring back some of the freshness it originally presented, and find a drafting mechanism that works well. I have stuck with the base game (although I would happily trade it) - and I'm super glad I didn't get any of the expansions while my enthusiasm was still fairly high (at least I trusted my instincts that far)...
______
Argghh! I knew it! I wish I would give more weight to my first instincts. I have lost much of the interest I had in this game. It turns out that the most interesting part of this game is the initial "stack draft," after which the game devolves into a dull, repetitive chore. Thing is, I knew that it would. Oh well...
______
Despite what I'm reading, I'm seeing that games are lasting considerably longer than I would expect given the essentially simple repetitive nature of the actual play. Shuffle, deal, play and buy cards, shuffle, re-deal, play then buy cards again, rinse and repeat - many, many times. I'm having serious doubts that this will continue to keep my attention for the length of time it takes to play. I had hoped this would be among the arsenal of "filler games" I like to have on hand, but it is far too long for a filler and lacks the "heft" of a main game. So, still with the reservations (preliminary rating trending downwards)...
______
Despite some reservations and skepticism about this highly hyped game, I finally got to play it and experienced the enthusiasm first time players seem to exhibit (I was surprised to find the deck building exercise could be as engrossing as it was). There is an addictive aspect to the game that simply has to be experienced to understand. What I'm not so sure of is whether the replayability and staying power is going to be there over the long haul. The durability of the cards is a concern and I'm going to try and sleeve the most commonly used ones - if the tray will still hold them!? This could well be a game that will wear out its welcome eventually. But so far, it has my attention!

RATING: 3
Provisional rating - might alter if/when I play more. I was expecting something much more 'wow' given all the hype and the way others were raving about it.

Mechanic of build your deck by drafting is really novel and has potential [Game gets an extra point for this alone] - but I feel it is a bit of a lost opportunity. 

Game play was dull and repetitious, and the decisions not all that agonising, and the shuffling - ugh, expect to shuffle your cards a lot in this game. Play some cards, ditch the rest, draw, then shuffle, repeat ...

Much prefer race for the galaxy as a super fast filler, and I really didn't get the "must play again now ..." feeling, certainly wouldn't want to spend an evening playing this over and over and over. 

Need to try with less players, maybe with less the game shines? Wasn't enthused enough to want to get my own copy (even in trade), many other games I'd rather play. Could have been the combination of cards used, it might be better with all of them in but less - so then there is pressure to grab the bits you need for your engine and you have freedom to try whatever you like, rather than be limited to a subset.

Thinking about it, I'm sure a computer implementation would be 100% better - faster to play & no physical shuffling required.

*** Update
Played more (as everyone else seems to think it is the best game ever ...) and rating has dropped. I find the game dull - there is an initial bit of thought when you see the card pool at the start, but after that it is all fairly obvious - draw, buy, shuffle, repeat. Trick is deciding at what point to stop developing your deck and switch to vp gathering.

Clever mechanics, but paper thin theme and very little interaction (even with the 'nasty' cards that some players refuse to use!) leaves me uninspired. Just hope the cult of the new will kick in and people will want to play something else.

**** Update
Continues to be flavour of the month with most (and an expansion to add more 'must play') and my rating has dropped further, now at the point I'll actively look for something else to play, or even just drop out and go home rather than play this again (and again and again) ... 

Maybe I'm missing something, but I've managed to do so in all the games I've played.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The aim of the game is to build a good deck so that in the final rounds you can buy as much victory points as possible.  Therefore, you need to keep a strategy in mind along the game.  However there is a bit of luck involved since the cards in hand are picked up at random from the pile you bought during the game.  well...this description might sound confusing but the game really isn't :) it is straight forward,you have various options to change the decks  so it won t get boring, and the element of luck involved is still structured around the deck of cards that you built so no big surprises there.  It should be fast paced but my first game took at least 1.5hrs (we played it as a 2 player game so  maybe that s why) 
Score: 5/5

An innovative deck-building game.
Play one or more cards form your hand, buy one or more open cards (shuffle) draw 5 cards. That’s the whole game. There are 3 type of cards: Actions cards which give you new actions, VP cards or money. Money is the second type of cards, as with the money in your hand you will pay. The last type is vp cards, which are useless during the game and block your hand but in the end only this cards will be counted. Dominion has an easy and addictive concept, which works very smooth. With 24 action cards, from which 10 will only be used, there will be a lot of variation. A game can be as short as 15 min but can also take until 45 to rare 60 min.

I know the theme is weak.  I know it often plays like multi-player solitaire.  But I don't care.  I really enjoy it and so does my wife.  We have the base game and Intrigue and that may be all we ever need.  The other expansions seem to slow the game down and introduce too many concepts.  With just the base game and Intrigue I get the feeling we'll have enough to hold us for a long time to come.

Ton of fun.   But thing to note, there is no theme to the game.   In fact, the pictures on the cards are not even necessary. 

But if you want a straight forward game, that you can spit out in 30 mins.   This is a great choice.

This is the original deck builder.   For me it is still one of the better ones.   And I love that designers have used this platform to make deck building a mechanic that you find in more complex games, and not just that game itself.  

But if you like a more simple deckbuilder with a tremendous amount of variance (because of how many different decks), Dominion and its expansions are excellent.

I took me a while to come around playing this game. It's a very preliminary grade, because I've just played it with two players. Luck can be decisive - it's a pain to play when you're on a streak of bad luck - and the depth is arguably quite limited, but it's very enjoyable and social; it's a good game for simply hanging out and chit-chatting.

This game is a blast!!  However, playing with the right group of people makes a big difference.  My first five plays were about 30 minutes each.   Then I played with my brother-in-law and nephew and that play took over an hour.  It was still fun but it moved alot slower (almost too slow).  I'm hoping that as they start playing it more, it will move quicker but we'll see.  To me one of the biggest pluses of this game is the fact that it is quick.  That said, it is a greta dynamic, never gets repetitive (since the different card mix keeps driving different tactics), has luck and skill.  It even has a bit of long-term strategy as you may try to plan what your deck will look like before you start.

Dominion is in my opinion the most overrated game on BGG.

It's all mechanics looking for a game, it's too long and too repetitive for what it is. Not recommended.

The gold standard for deckbuilding games. The base game alone offers a lot of variety and complex interactions, and defines the mechanics you need for the rest of the expansions.
A great card game overall, but as you add more and more expansions, the game gets to be quite a chore to drag out and setup to play. My group has a house rule that if we bust out Dominion, we are playing at least three games, because setting up the required cards can be time consuming.
That said, nobody ever complains when we want to play three games of this...

I love CCG's, but other people always seem to give up on them before me. And all the good CCG's revolved around deck-building, which each player really needs to do for themself. Dominion is basically a great, quick CCG where deckbuilding is not only mandatory and fun, it is the point.

I really enjoy Dominion! I love the deckbuilding aspect of the game, and because victory points are hidden in the player decks it adds a level of excitement to the endgame that other games sometimes lack. I have had a long history of CCG's and while I don't play too many now, Dominion satisfies that itch. A must own and very approachable by gamers and non-gamers alike!

I just don't really find Dominion fun. Part of the issue might be that most cards in the base set are rather bland; I'm sure it's a much livelier and richer game with expansions thrown in. 

My core problem with Dominion, though, is that it feels like a solitaire game. The amount of interaction with your opponents is just not high enough for me. I get bored.

The deck-building mechanics in this game are really clever. I can see how why the design has won so much praise. But while I can intellectually appreciate what the designers accomplished, when I actually play Dominion, I just don't find any joy in it.

Absolutely nailed it.  One of the few games I've played lately that seems to precisely reach its goals.  Fast-paced, eminently replayable, totally fun.  

EDIT:  After many plays, breaks down a bit.  A fun game for sure, but the openness of the game when initially playing gives way to the realization that kingdom cards are often ineffective or barriers to victory.  Downgraded to 7.

Ok card game with some clean play that keeps it going at a good pace. The constant shuffling is annoying. The cards allow for some variation in choosing actions, but seems repetitive even after one play. UPDATE: Raised rating after playing again and getting more familiar with the cards. The boys really took to it (Josh - age 17, and Andrew, age 14, even Matthew, age 13, enjoyed it). Rating may continue to increase upon further plays. UPDATE: Upon further plays it has become apparent that my initial experience at the end of a tiring day of gaming resulted in a skewed initial rating, and rate this base game a solid 8. UPDATE: I believe it is deserving of a 9 rating with the popularity and a nice variety of kingdom card settings. UPDATE: Back down to an 8 with sameness setting in, and Intrigue offers more interesting cards.

This is definitely a good game, but I'm not all that sure it's quite as deserving of its high praise here on the Geek.  I'm not massively keen on the overly tactical, rather than strategic play, demanded by having a new hand of cards every round -- and all the deck shuffling upsets my over-protective sensibilities; I just worry about the cards getting too worn too quickly.  However, once past those concerns, the game does shine, and there's a real joy from getting that perfect hand come up, the one you'd slavishly drafted for.

Supposedly, the best thing about Dominion is that after finishing a game, you want to play again immediately. In my case, however, Dominion falls flat. I feel like the whole game lasts 30 seconds, the time required to see the available kingdom cards and decide how you plan to win the game. After that, it is just a matter of going through the motions. While I appreciate its innovative design, I'd rather play Race for the Galaxy or Magic the Gatering instead, two card games before which Dominion simply pales.

No, I guess Dominion isn't dead. And whenever I play this game, it's pretty enjoyable, but I would play Star Realms over this any time.

I totally dig that this is a good game. I just feel like it's given it's gift, and now we can just remember it whenever we think fondly of the ancient roots of the beautiful, thematic, interactive deckbuilding game that we're playing instead of dominion.

Full Disclosure - I am not one of the engineers that pre-determined this game to be in the Top Ten.

Yes, it's got some originality. But a whole lot of card shuffling. Stack your deck full of money cards and load up on veep cards. Multi-player solitary card shuffling. This is not the second coming. And this is certainly over-hyped. 

Its virtue? Its vacuousness only lasts 30 minutes.

#6 highest rated game of all time? Puh-leeze.

Update March 2012: this really is a meh game. No matter what expansion or decks you mix in - it's the same strategy. Build up a small deck or get actions that let you get draw cards. Put lots of money into your deck. Then start buying VPs.

RATING: 5
Interesting deck building game. I like the fact that there's limited amount of cards used in a game but that there's variation in the cards that are used in each game. Plays fast and is simple enough even for non-gamers to try out.

I'm usually skeptical on the games which get hyped a lot because usually they tend not to meet the expectations but Dominion is interesting and rating might rise when I get more plays in.

EDIT: played the game 15 times mostly in BSW and liking it more and more. Rating up to 8

RATING: 7
46 plays.  Closing in on 50 plays.  I still like Dominion and have never seen the need to get any of the expansions.  It helps that a lot of people I know also know how to play this, so it's easy to pull out.  I think 7 Wonders is a better game with similar features, but I think Dominion will continue to be played semi-regularly for years to come.  Looking forward to teaching it to my kids. 

This is quick and easy, and most everyone who's tried it likes it, and for that reason it gets played a lot.  I tend to enjoy it while I'm playing, but don't find myself relishing the idea much beforehand.  Not sure why that is; I think it's that I'd rather play some meatier games but I do enjoy this once I get into it.  I have no doubt it'll be a staple of game nights for years to come.

After playing Intrigue, I don't see the need to get it.  I don't like the length it adds to the game while you're trying to figure out how best to use your multi-ability card.  Ditto with Seaside.  I will definitely look into any small-format expansions that get released, but I don't think I'll (over)play Dominion enough to warrant any of the expensive, big box expansions.

A good base for mixing with other more complicated expansion, mostly because it is the simplest.  Maybe a bit too simple by itself for my taste but I never play it alone anymore.

RATING: 10
I love deckbuilding, and Dominion is still the best deckbuilding game that I've played so far (e.g. it's deeper, more elegant and less luck-based than, for example, Thunderstone or Ascension.)

It's really fun to think about all the Kingdom cards and to try different strategies with them. It's true that the game feels a bit multiplayer solitaire, and can be played almost in autopilot. But it actually isn't multiplayer solitaire, if you want to play well. You have to pay attention to what the other players buy, and how far the game has progresses, and you need to adjust your buys accordingly.

The base set is a bit low on interaction, otherwise solid.

It's not absolutely awful. I'll give it that.

What it *IS*, though, is a maze with one possible entrance and one possible exit. Many might argue that the variety in cards and the potential combos give Dominion incredible replay value, but a conscientious gamer will simply sit in front of any given card selection for about 5 minutes, figure out the optimal combination and stick to it until the game ends.

Perhaps this is the game for you if you plan to play with a somewhat disinterested friend, or with a happy-go-lucky gamer who is not so concerned with winning. That is not the case for me -and within my gaming circles.

Dominion was my very first deck builder experience so it has that nostalgia factor that keeps me from rating it lower. I really enjoy it every time that I play it, but I find that over time it has come out to play less and less frequently. This is due mainly to its static nature. Even with a ton of expansions it still gets stale after awhile and begins to feel kind of pointless. It's fun, but it's not as fun as it once was.

Dominion was my first true and "nothing but deckbuilding" game. I owned MageKnight before but I had to try a game that doesn't do anything but deckbuilding, so I bought a used copy of Dominion.
I didn't regret it. It is a nice filler game that flows very well. Lots of choices, lots of strategies.

But at some point it might reach a state where it becomes boring.
Therefore I like Arctic Scavengers (which came out at the same time) or other deckbuilders much more but I understand why Dominion is such a success.

RATING: 10
I do think this is a solid game though, and quite enjoyable.  However, everyone seems gaga over this one and I don't really understand it.  It's a little too solitaire for me I think.

Update June 2011:  I sort of got burned out on this game after the original, and didnt really revisit it until now.   I've got to say, it's far more interesting with all these new expansions and in the fun ways that they all interact with one another in random setups.   This sort of replayability is something the original Dominion was missing, and I have found a new appreciation for the game.

Rating up to a 9.

Update Aug 2011:

Rating upped to a 10.  This is the first game that I had initially rated poorly (6 in this case) that turned into a 10.   

Having played a hundred or so games online now, I'm struck with how even after a ton of plays new strategies and considerations can come into play depending on the random card selection.

Now it's important to note that without the expansions, I'd rate Dominion a 7.   But with all the expansions and random setups, this becomes a 10.

While I've grown somewhat sick of the base game (as I've done about as much heuristic calculating of the initial 25 cards as I'm going to do), the three "big box" expansions have kept it surprisingly fresh and engaging.

Dominion was a lucky score at a local thrift: $3 for a complete base game, in unwrapped yet possibly unplayed condition. This was a game that I was curious about, but not enough so to dive in at full retail. I'm glad of that, because while I've heard that expansions make it shine, I haven't been excited enough by the base game to add something like 10x my initial outlay to improve it a little. I did get a few promos just to see how things would change. While I can see many common threads of design between Dominion and Kingdom Builder, I ultimately far prefer the latter.

When I first heard about [b]Dominion[/b] and the description of how it was played I was a little confused on the mechanics.  It's a game that is a bit hard to explain without actually sitting down to play.  But once you play it it is easy to understand.  

It is a card game where you build custom decks out of a common pool of cards.  It's not a collectible card game, and the actual building of the decks is a key mechanic of the game itself.  It is a very clever design that has already inspired many new games with their own similar deck building mechanics.

The one thing I don't like about the game is that there a very little interaction between the players.  Most of the cards don't affect your opponents at all.  It's the limited numbers of each card where the most interaction occurs.  Most games have a "multi-player solitaire" feel to them.

Another mechanism that is new to me- this time, deck building. Very fast to play and learn. Needs lots of shuffling - card protectors seem like a very good idea.

Update:  I like it even better with three expansions.  This is the one game I can easily see my girl enjoying.

This really is the quientisential deck building game.

Probably my favorite deck builder. It is a bit dull at times but it feels less luck based then most. Got a bit burned out on it so it doesn't hit the table as often as it used to. It still comes out a decent amount though.

RATING: 7
Ahh, Dominion.  Another game that took me a long time to get worked up over - or, if not worked up, at least convince myself I needed to have.  Why?  Well, there is my longstanding dissatisfaction with most card games, coupled with the incredibly over-the-top amount of fanboy love showered during the initial months it was out.  Plus all that damn shuffling!  As someone who hates riffle-shuffles ('cause I suck at the technique, and hate the wear on the cards) the amount of shuffling was definitely a turn-off.  But with so much hype, there was no way to avoid getting it, right?  So we got it.

It is a very good game.  In fact, it definitely deserves all the accolades it has received.  All the cards are useful, given the right combination, even if some don't seem so at first.  What I like most about the game is the post-mortem aspect of it - at the end of the game, you can spread your deck out, and SEE the whole game at a glance.  It helps analysis and building strategy immensely.  The design is fresh, and really deserves the SdJ.  Plus, it does justify expansions.  Not millions of them, but I can already see how Intrigue could add a lot, as some cards are a bit boring for my taste.  Overall, though, it still lacks just a little spark for me - it is a game I admire more than desire.  I love playing it, but rarely suggest it, and can't bring myself to play more than twice in a row.  And all that shuffling?  I actually like it, in a Zen sort of way.  I don't do a riffle shuffle, but usually a pile-shuffle, and the down time actually helps the game to flow better for me, as I am no fan of games where everyone is playing fast and furious, to the point where I can't tell or care what anyone else is doing.  The shuffling makes our games more like 30 min rather than 20, but that's fine by me.

An excellent game, especially for former CCGers who want that feel again without having to invest a bajillion dollars in cards, just to lose to the guy who invested 2 bajillion dollars.

This has quickly become a new favorite of the group, especially because of its speed, and its ability to work well for only 2 players.

RATING: 6.5
I really hated this game the first time I played: everyone at the table was just silently taking their turns, and I felt that I would rather just play alone (or not play at all). When the game abruptly ended, it seemed totally arbitrary and I felt as though it didn't matter that there were other players there.

After a few more plays, I like it more, but still feel that the game is too short and desperately needs more player interaction. I'm considering buying Intrigue just to add more "take that" elements to the game. 

Oh yeah: set-up and clean-up are also a pain, and man oh man, all that shuffling...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The second coming.. this ain't.  Lots of shuffling and low on interaction.. really low.  I think you could all be in separate rooms, play the game on your own, and come back to see what the best score was.

I'm looking forward to trying the published edition.  I'm hoping I'll see something in it that I didn't before.. as I'm sure it will see some play in my local group.

Update: I've tried the published edition.. it's exactly what I remembered.. multi-player solitaire.  Ah well.  It's fun to build up your deck and mess around, but it's not really a game.. because there's so little interaction.  Still, I do find myself wanting to play with it and optimize... but it still feels like it's more a puzzle than anything.

Second Update:  I think I've figured out what it is.  I love the deck building mechanic, but the game that you play with this mechanic is rather lackluster.  It's plays so quickly that I'm willing to play it whenever right now, I'm just hoping something else will "click", though my hopes aren't high.

Third update: I've raised it to an 8.  I don't think it's climbing any higher.. and I suspect it will actually fall eventually.  It's fun, and I want to play it a lot right now, but I think the depth only goes as far as the expansions do.. and I'm not sure I'm willing to spend that much on a game if they keep churning out expansions.  I was already burned by the RftG expansion being 18 cards and retailing for $25, I'm not sure I want more of the same with this game.

RATING: 10
I don't have many games that I rate a "10".  I also have yet to rate a game a "10" right out of the box.  I want to play it several times before I decide to rate it "perfect".  I will say that Dominion probably had the shortest path to a "10" out of any game I own.  The more I play it, the more I see the subtlety of the game.  I love how changeable it is (by switching Kingdom cards) and how it affects your strategy from game to game.  This deserves a "10".

Ich sehe nicht, warum das Zusammenstellen des Decks während des Spiels so ein Riesengewinn gegenüber handelsüblichen TCG sein soll, auch wenn es sicher originell ist. Interaktion gibt es wenig, die Karten sind schön, aber es gibt vergleichsweise nicht besonders viele verschiedene. Ich war etwas enttäuscht nach all dem Lob. Naja, vielleicht muss ich es öfter spielen.

My wife actually ENJOYS this game! That fact alone puts it in the top tier of my collection.

EDIT: I unleashed this on the game group last night and they ate it up! Four games in a row, and they wanted a fifth game but it was 2am and I had to go home. This game gets bumped to a 10.

EDIT 2: I've introduced this game to several more non-gamers and they've all loved it. This game would get an 11, if I could do so.

05/07/09: The game is getting knocked down to a 9 for now. I still love the game, but it's getting less table time nowadays, and a new 10 has emerged for me (CoH). Perhaps the upcoming Dominion expansion will put it back at the top.

09/06/11: Knocking this down to an 8. Even with some expansions, this game has largely played itself out with my group. 

01/25/12: Lowering to a 7, and it'll probably stay there. We're just not really playing this game anymore. It's still a good game, so I'll not move it down below 7, regardless of how little we play it in the future. The BGG description of a 7 ("Good Game. Usually willing to play") sums up my feelings pretty accurately.

I have not played 5 games in a row of a new game since I was buying one game every six months as a 12-year-old kid.  Love the mutability and on-the-fly strategic (not tactical) decisions you have to make.  Wish I could have played it more, and will have more to say after more plays.  I have played Race for the Galaxy three times, and it has not yet caught on with me.  This did after about 10 minutes.

UPDATE:  This game wore out its welcome fast.  Its only lasting impact on my gaming life will be that it got me interested in dead CCGs again.  Great design ideas, but there isn't even a spark of story or life in this game.  I'd rather not play a game at all than play this.  And the cards and shuffling are, sorry, a pain in the ass.

RATING: 9
The more I play this game, the more I like it. Getting a good hand is a great, great feeling. The only problem is that I don't have a regular playing partner. My fiancee hates the game (I have no idea why), and my brother visits infrequently and is at best lukewarm toward it.

UPDATE: I am enjoying this a bit less now. Gameplay is quite abstract, and feeling a bit too similar from play to play (though I have yet to try the expansions). Plus my fiancee still dislikes the game, is quite bad at it, and absolutely despises any of the interactive cards (e.g., the ones that force you to take Curses).

UPDATE: BSW has significantly upgraded my opinion. Even my wife (the former fiancee) likes this game quite a bit online. Playing online makes you realize how much or your FTF time is spent setting up, shuffling, etc.; BSW lets you just focus on building your deck. What's quite unusual is that I've won all but one game on BSW, but my wife still likes to play it! 

UPDATE: Ye of little faith. The expansions have really improved my opinion of this game, especially in BSW. I will play this any time.

Not bad and I did want to play more, which is good - in the hope that the game's attractions would grow on me.  With a few more games they did, but for me they fade fairly quickly after a few more.  That's maybe mostly down to the lack of any real theme, as this is pretty much naked mechanics, but whatever the reason it no longer enthuses me.

RATING: 7
I came back to Dominion again recently after a long, Thunderstone-enforced break, and you know what really pissed me off? Why the hell did they use such a tiny f#!king font for the card powers?! They are impossible to read from any distance. There is tons of space on the card, and the geniuses who did the graphic layout went with like a 6-point font for everything. They should be fired. Rating reduced because the physical design so badly inhibits play, and because of RGG's stubborn refusal to fix multiple egregious, glaring problems of this kind despite several opportunities in the expansions.

With that out of the way, my biggest complaint about Dominion has loomed larger - too many combinations of cards yield entirely uninteresting games. Many sets simply devolve to buying as much cash as you can. Some devolve into pointlessness as cash is too easily destroyed and not enough money is generated and things take forever. In many, half the cards you should never, ever buy. There is an admittedly fairly large sweet spot where the card mix generates an interesting game, but like Agricola, the  diversity appears much greater than it actually is. The designer needed to spend more time on mechanisms to ensure reasonable card mixes and less on throwing every card idea he had at us. One non-Seaside Dominion set seems to work, but combine two, and it seems to go unstable too often.

A friend of mine commented that Thunderstone takes Dominion and makes a game out of it. I think that's strikingly true. I like Dominion; I just wish it were more stable and reliably produced better games and the physical design wasn't such a god-awful train wreck. I like Thunderstone (and Race for the Galaxy) much more.

FWIW, my favorite Dominion configuration is Intrigue stand-alone. I think the cards in Intrigue are more interesting and it usually produces a good game. The core set is probably the most reliably good game, but the cards are somewhat less interesting to me.
---
I still like Dominion, but it feels just a touch  undercooked to me. The Thief and Gardens seem to be game-changers in ways that don't quite feel satisfactory to me, and it seems like there aren't enough defensive cards. Some stuff feels slightly mispriced. I like the game quite a bit, but it doesn't have the same draw as Race for the Galaxy and is in very much the same space. Also, the completely AWOL theme is a bummer, as is the terrible graphic and communication design, both of which lend an air of amateurism to the whole thing, which isn't good.
---
I can't comment on Dominion without going into a slight usability rant. I think  they did a great job with the illustrations, but why, oh why, are gold cards not gold, silver silver, and copper copper? They are too hard to tell apart during play. Same comment goes for estates, etc. Also, they took a page out of the Magic book that they probably shouldn't have: one of the card's most important features, its cost, is a tiny icon. This should have been larger.

This is only a minor gripe, but it's unfortunate to compare the tremendous communication design of Race for the Galaxy's with the thoroughly mediocre design on Dominion, especially considering that Dominion has to convey vastly less information, and yet still can't reliably do it.
---
As I've played Dominion more I've come to enjoy it more. Still not convinced it's going to be a big long-term winner, but we'll see. I think a lot of the variety is somewhat illusory; not all combinations of cards is going to produce an interesting game, and there are certain "baseline" cards that'll have to be in almost any game, so like Agricola, what you see is more than what you actually get.

Still, it's been fun, the game has been more robust than I had expected and somewhat more flexible, and I look forward to logging a few plays on this one.

A multiplayer race to solve and build the best probability engine. The attack cards make the race a bit more interactive. It's such a well designed puzzle that the scant interaction doesn't really bother me - do we really think that the 100 meter dash would be improved if you could trip the other guy?

Fast, fun, easy to teach. More thematic than some give it credit for.  Eminently likable. 

Update 6/21/11: The more I play this (with expansions), the more strategic avenues I see and the more interesting it gets.  So far no other deck-building game I've tried comes close.     

Update 1/6/12: Dominion has gotten a bit stale at this point, I think because I've played Magic again and remembered how much more diverse its game play is than Dominion's.

Classic Deckbuilding. Many variations, strategy usually must adapt to the cards available. Reliance on ratios, card stacking and some luck. Rated down from 9 to 8 because there can sometimes be a 'clear path to victory' in some card combinations. This can be a very math-based, ratios game. Sometimes you will get very great, tense games, with 2 or more people employing completely different strategies.

I was told that I probably wouldn't enjoy this game if I didn't really like CCGs.  Boy, was that person ever wrong!  This is an engine building game, a genre that I really love, and is certainly among the best of it's type that I've ever played.  The variety created by using a different set of 10 cards every game is really the icing on the cake, as the game completely changes based on the 10 available action cards.  A very innovative and great game!

However, after several plays of the base set I started to get stale on the original 25 cards.  However, that all changed with the expansions which is why I pushed my rating of Dominion down a tick, and raised ratings on the expansions.

Following the Seaside expansion, this has surpassed Race for the Galaxy in my eyes.  The added level of planning and added game length that many of the cards require (especially Embargo and Native Village) have turned this game from a race for money to buy Provinces into something approximating a light board game.

The variability of kingdom cards provides impressive replay value without sacrificing player control over the outcome.

I hate that the theme is pasted on (a deck is nothing like a functioning empire), but the game is blatant about the centrality of the mechanics, so it seems more forgivable here than in Race for the Galaxy. 

All-in-all, a fun, light, tactical game that I enjoy playing between longer board games.

Dominion is a game that popularize a revolutionary mechanics of non-CCG deck building. Many fine games today would not exist if not for Dominion. However, it must be noted that the game itself is very theme light - its first of all a card manipulation game, that never really gives you a feeling that you are a ruler managing his realm. Artwork and card names seem forced onto card effect that rarely make logical connection in my mind. Interaction with other players can be severely limited, and there is sometimes too much shuffling, and too little actual playing - it gets a bit tedious after a while. The game also takes a while to play with 4 or more players.

Dominion is an easy deck builder to teach. It is a lot of fun, but can get a little boring when most people just go for the gold then the province. I have not tried many expansions yet and I am hoping they will shake things up!

Gave in and bought a copy of Dominion.  Reading through the rules I still don't have a good feeling about it, but wanted to understand the game to help the McHenry's out.  (01/4/10)

Played it last night with Heather and she thought it was OK, "pretty brainless and obvious".  Other than set up time it's a pretty fast game which has some obvious strategies.  I don;t mind playing it whenever with Heather and whoever.  Right now I will simply rate a 6 as it is only OK.  (01/07/09)

OK we upped the rating in September now that we love this game.  It finally went over well and we bought nearly all the expansions.  Dominion itself is 7.5 but the expansions are all much higher! (09/22/12)

Exciting game idea, but somehow it works out poorly in the end. Building one's deck is a relatively slow process, so it becomes tough to respond to opponents. Furthermore, we often encountered a runaway-leader problem.

Quick and easy fun for beginners.  Enjoyable optimization game once experienced.  Very varied experiences depending on action cards available.  Plays well with 2, 3, or 4.  I always feel like I've had fun when its done.  
Slight update for June 2012, reduced to 9.5 ranking.  Is starting to burn out.  
This also deals with the system as whole, the base set on its own is more like an 8.

Yeah, it'll probably get old. The hands play themselves for the most part; all of the challenge is in learning the cards and building the machine. Still, I always loved the idea of CCG's, and Dominion plays the way I wanted MtG to play. It's ridiculously addictive.

RATING: 9.5
There are an abundance of comments here that illustrate clearly why people like actual game play.  Here is why I rated Dominion a 9.5:

I bought Dominion Big Box over a year ago and finally got around to playing it this month.  I took it to a large family camping trip last week and ended up teaching 9 different people how to play it, ages 12-57.  The oldest people were women who feel most comfortable playing games like Yahtzee and Scrabble, and several others were primarily video gamers who are into games like Munchkin and Risk.  

They all absolutely loved Dominion.  In fact, they were fighting to play it. Even my mother-in-law was reluctant to give up her spot!  

These are my in-laws, and I've been camping with them for 15 years now.  This is the first year I have ever seen them all come together and truly enjoy a game across gender and age groups.  They have brought many games in the past, and I've brought things like Shadows over Camelot and Settlers.  

Admittedly, several of the non-gamers were nervous about playing when they saw the cards; they were overwhelmed at first.  However, I convinced them that it would be easy for them once they got started, and I was right.  

I highly recommend this game to just about anyone.  It definitely filled every niche in my family.

... and then came along Legendary - A Marvel Deck Building Game...

RATING: 9
One of the tightest, best constructed games I've ever played. Whilst I find the base set a little dull compared to Intrigue, it tickles my aesthetic sensibilities as it is, in many cases, the simplest possible cards given the core mechanics. Village gives you net +1 action, Lab gives you net +1 card, etc.

Great game for both newbies and veterans of board games! Rather than being a deck-building game where the player who gets the most "promo packs" win, the game itself IS deck-building. And everyone has an equal shot to win!

With only 2 two player games under my belt and both with the same basic supply cards, I think this could be a very good game. 
It's a game where balance seems to be key, whether you start early with Victory Points or wait till you build up your arsenal.

After a few more plays, I'm going to move this up from an 8 to a 9.

The more I play this game, the more I like it.  The synergy between different cards fascinates me; it means different plays require different strategies, and playing the game twice in a row does not feel like overkill.

RATING: 7
If played with gardens and witches it becomes a more interesting and dynamic game. I wish there were more attack cards in the basic game.  

It's super easy to learn so if you want to introduce friends to board game it could be a good start. Still, with the most exciting card being a witch that gives a curse there are so  many other games that have more humor on the cards. The cards look nice and are easy to handle which is necessary with all the shuffling going on in this game. 

There is quite a lot of luck in this game, but not as much as you would think. It's all about balancing your deck and buying the right cards at the right moment. If you think a bit about the statistics when buying cards you will have a deck that is a bit more useful.

Innovative card game that plays quickly with so many paths to victory.  As soon as you pick up your first hand, the paths to success between you and the other players immediately diverge.  There are some nits to pick, like WTF is the Chancellor good for? and the certain card combinations that seem to break and/or delay the game (i.e. workshop/garden or village/smithy).  However, the game is amazing 95% of the time.  One of those games you can play back-to-back for hours without getting bored.

The king of deckbuilding still holds the crown. The huge card pool allows for endless variety, and the fun comes from working through the set-ups to find the best combos. Criticism as multiplayer solitaire is valid, as you can't do anything significant to block opponents in the race to the finish the game becomes. However, the engine building is satisfying, and its variety makes up for its flaws.

RATING: 4
As a disclaimer, I generally hate games where you have to find the best card combos. They wind up serving people who want to play the same game endlessly. Great for them, but for me, this game just doesn't merit that kind of attention. 

Add this to my dislike for deckbuilding and naked solatairish engine building and this is just not a game for me. 

And I know a lot of people accuse games with subtle or low amounts of player interaction for having none at all, but this game truly borders on zero player interaction. Even the attack and defense cards seem to get played more for the additional coin/card/action bonuses attached to them. Otherwise you play your hand. No piggbacking ala RftG, no fight for cards/actions ala Goa/PoF. NOTHING.

The game lasts too long (I would say 45 minutes for people who have played less than 10 games) to stomach that.

Dominion + all expansions we own: The cards have hit the table very often and already show signs of tear and wear!

We are moderately annoyed that the new german version (which uses, I think, the same cards as the english version) is incompatible with the old version! New expansions are only available for the new version!

Either way, we condensed the game into one box, but we are also not very likely to pull this game out again, as we have played it "to death" already! More likely, we are going to grab Guildhall, which is faster to setup and offers some interesting interactions between the players. Still, Dominion is one of the best (and least convoluted) deckbuilders out there!

Easy recommendation.

[u]October 09:[/u] Laurène's newest craze, she just keeps wanting to play this one... Although I agree the gme is really fun and begs to be played over and over again, I'm already finding the first touches of lassitude after 20 games... I still have fun and it is so short that we can just get it out anytime so it will likely continue to get played for a long time, but I'm afraid replayability isn't as great as I thought...

[u]January 10:[/u] Got the expansion as Laurène wanted to play more and I was already tiring. We introduced several of my friends to the game, including some that had never played recent boardgames before, and it was a hot with everyone. However, the game is already not coming out much anymore. However, I think this is a game that you'll want to play over and over. Once the game comes out again, it will probably be played to death once more, then it will disappear for some more time then reappear and get played a lot, etc... For the moment, it's not getting played... [b]Downgraded the rating from 7.5 to 7.[/b]


[u]May 2014[/u]: I just realized why this game, despite being brilliantly executed does not work so well for us. We did liek the game while exploring the game space but now I realize that I never quite managed to get into a game of Dominion as I have been able to get into a game of RFTG for example. There are two reasons for this, the major one is that there is no immediate feedback on your actions. Every action you take won't really affect the state space until several rounds later. This could be great except that the state space never changes dramatically. Everything is continuous, there is no real sense of progression. The second reason is the fact that once you have made your choice of strategy early game, the implementation of it is rather straightforward. Sure, sometimes you'll have to adapt but I feel like this is rather rare. Overall, it almost seems like the players take one decision at the beginning of the game (which cards will I focus on) and then the game kind of plays itself until we know who the winner is...
Overall, I recognize that the design is great and very innovative and I have had great enjoyment of discovering the state space but it has always been more a polite liking than a passionate liking... whatever that means...

RATING: 7.5
My first couple of plays were with 2 players, and I think it's more fun with more players as the attack cards start to shine, and I think one should always include a couple of attack cards so it doesn't feel too solitarish. 
I do, however, appreciate a game of Dominion with only 2 players and no attack cards now, but that certainly wasn't the case first time I played it. 

The downtime is minimal unless somebody reveals a killer combo of Villages combined with +X cards, but compared to many other games you don't have to think a lot during your turn as you can often only do a few different things.

There is luck involved (it's a card game after all), but it doesn't bother me at all as a superior strategy will win most/all of the times. And that's exactly one of Dominion's strengths: there are hundreds of strategies to pursue (with no broken strategy) and the games will never be the same because of the card shuffling and the 10 different kingdom cards you choose!

Also, my girlfriend and frankly everybody I play games with like it quite a lot, more than me, and if they suggest it I will gladly play it with them.

My personal recommended number of players: 2, 3, 4

I have played this game over 100 times. lots of replay value and the game holds up its interest. Not to me mention there  are a ton of expansions and I think the game doesn't necessarily need all that's out there, but the expansions are there for vast amounts of variety. I'll only play this with 2 or 3 players, anymore and it suffers from lots of downtime. I still would like more player interaction because it feels more like solitaire. Even with all that said this is a great deck builder that won't go away. The combos and planning are amazing in this, probably some of the best card combos out there. I own the big box and that's enough to keep me entertained.

One of the better games of 2008 in my opinion.  The options are varied, and the replayability is unlike anything else because your usable cards are constantly evolving.  There is nothing here that needs fixed or adjusted to play - everyone plays with exactly what is there - no more and no less.

This is one of the most innovative games I've seen in a long time.  It's deceptively simple once you play it once or twice.  It's not terribly interactive, but that's probably it's only fault.  Try to grab silver and gold when you can, especially gold.  Most winning decks are designed to get to 8 coins as fast as possible to start buying provinces.  It's possible to win in other ways, but not recommended for beginners.  Dominion Intrigue is a must expansion once you've played enough of the basic game.

The original deckbuilder!  Dominion gets a lot of points for the great mechanic of using your deck to buy a card and then shuffle that card into your deck to draw later on.

When I first played this was a blast - lots of strategies and experimentation and close games.

However, some of the cards and strategies became clearly more powerful.  The chapel/big money strategy seems impossible to counter.  Also as the game has aged I would go to Thunderstone over this any-day because of the theme and deeper strategy.

**Had many plays before logging.

The variance in which cards will be in the particular play adds a fun twist, as does the deck/card handling.  It takes a few games to be able to appropriately understand strategy.

Disclaimer: My comments are only based on BSW play of Dominion. Might be completely different when played with actual humans in the same room. BSW does take the shuffle and "housekeeping" out of the equation. For some players who have difficulty shuffling cards this might be a "deal breaker."

I like the fast paced nature of this game. With most sets and experienced players a game will last only about 30 min. Very simple to learn. I still hate the Witch.

Update: Played for "real" with game night friends. Everyone seemed to enjoy this card only game. Shuffling can get a bit tiresome but all-in-all a great game.

With the new expansions I LOVE this game family! I think it's my favorite 2 player game of all time!

Update to the Update: Total obsession! I LOVE all the expansions to this game...I think I will be collecting them for years to come.

Best with 3 (per BGG) prefer 2

Nov 2014. Since I've gotten everything except for Alchemy and Cornucopia now, I should update the rating. 
9 - for the Dominion system. Great great system. Although the first one, still one of the most streamlined and smoothest deck builders. 
7.5 - for how I rate the dominion base game. 

Sep 2012 Dislike initially, but wondering if you have multiple sets.  Good game with unlimited variety and replayability.

I have played this 3 times.  I like it, but the game is very dependent on the group and the array of cards in the market.  I can't shake the weak theme and the intensely solitaire nature of the game.  Look at the market, pick a strategy, execute, and cross your fingers that its better than what the other person is doing. At the end of the game, look up from your cards, compare strategies, and declare the victor.  

I think I need to play it more to get into the right mindset for this albeit very clever game.

I need to try Dominion out with a different group.  When I played it with my usual group, they were more used to the Ascension/DC Deckbuilder style where you can make multiple purchases on your turn.  I also would like to try adding an expansion or two as well

[b]Includes upgrade pack[/b]

The original deck-building game has proven to be possibly the ultimate "spouse game" that I play with my wife. And the funny thing is that I was resistant to Dominion at the start. Due to some sort of resistance to the Cult of the New and hype, I put off trying this game for quite some time until the thought struck me that my wife might like it.

Boy am I glad--I got the base game on the cheap, and my wife and I swiftly racked up 20+ plays, which of course led to the expansions. Dominion is swift, fun, and addictive. It definitely has that slot machine satisfaction of seeing your hand reload with the cards that you've picked up along the way. There's all sorts of combo goodness in a game of Dominion.

Are there any flaws? Sure... the game has virtually no theme. I recognize cards by what they do and not by what theme they convey, and I never even try to connect the dots between the two. That's about it though. The shuffling doesn't bother me. I've never tried playing the game with 5 players, and I imagine that might be a drag. But for 4 players and less, looking for something quick with a heck of a lot of replayability, this game has it in spades.

RATING: 7
As smooth a deckbuilder as you can have with plenty of cards not just in the base but with the almost the dozen expansions out now give you plenty of opportunities to try out new and different cards each time. The attack cards bring some interaction to the game, but in some ways slow the game down a bit as you may have to wait for your opponent to finish shuffling before completing the action. If I didn't have Legendary I'd consider this, but now with the second edition maybe it's worth it still.

Great game that is a little different every time and has a cool theme. The deck building gives players the ability to completely develop their own strategy to find and create card combinations. There is limited player interaction, however, even when attack cards are in the game. On the upside however, this is one of the few games that still works extremely well with only two players, which makes it a useful addition to any game collection.

I had a very bad opinion about the game after few games online. But all changed when I played it with real cards. My group loves it, it's always different and interesting depending on the cards in play. And considering that each game has only 10 cards from about 100+ (with expansions), you can never try every combination in your lifetime.

A game based around deck building is a nice idea. It's a shame the gameplay itself is so repetitive and boring. The lack of interaction and the way the cards are just laid out in front of you makes me think that, like in CCG deckbuilding, there will be optimal picks. If there are known paths through, then replayability may not be so good. On the other hand, I can see it could be quite addictive.

This saw a lot of play when it first came out and it still sees some play every now and then. My wife and I like it because of the variability. We randomly select our 10 card sets each time we play and we think that adds to the challenge. It helps keep us from getting stuck in a certain strategy.

I admit that this game was as much of a mechanical innovation as Caylus (or whatever that other game is that actually pioneered worker placement).  As a game, though, I rate it a solid meh.  It's well constructed but somehow not terribly involving.  The "multiplayer solitaire" trait, which I don't mind in many other economic engine games, bothers me here.  And the shuffling is just annoying.

Love this game. My brother in law introduced it to me and I liked it enough to buy my own copy. Now the whole family is addicted. I like the variety stemming from the use of 10 out of 25 possible Kingdom cards for each play. The rules and play turns are simple enough to make things flow quickly, yet the strategy is deceptively deep. Plus, the variety keeps you on your toes--you cannot just come up with a standard play strategy & run that every time.

5-2016: Revised down a bit. Still really enjoy this game, but looking for deeper ones these days. It will remain in the collection though.

RATING: 5
Put this into a category of game I am more and more unenthusiastic about - efficiency engine card games with minimal player interaction. See: Race for the Galaxy, St. Petersburg, etc. While I appreciate the deck-tuning aspect of Dominion, I find the player interaction - both social and gameplay - to be minimal. While there is an element of pacing control, it is subtle at best. Meanwhile, the more 'aggressive' action cards are really just a simple min/max decision - and a relatively simple one at that - without having any really tactical or strategic importance. So, really, the enjoyment of the game comes down to getting your machine humming faster than the other guy's. And I do understand that enjoyment. I think of it as time trial compared to a road race. It is just not for me.

I should note that I still love San Juan for sentimental reasons if not for real gameplay. It may be the only efficiency card game I like. But even SJ requires you to play the other players in role selection and the building of buildings complementary to your opponents role needs.

Finally broke down and bought this, and I'm glad I did.  Nice, simple, fast-playing game.  Good artwork on cards, and fun to play combos. And aside from a couple cards, it's mostly non-confrontational (which is best for playing with my wife)

[b][u]Update[/u][/b]: Dropping this a full point to 7.0.  I'm split on playing this now.  Playing with casual players, I have lots of fun.  But, playing with "serious" players it's become a painful, un-fun experience.

The original deck building game. 100% worth playing at some point to see where everything came from. There are some balance issues with individual cards but still one of the best deck-builders out there.

I don't think this game is just a flash in the pan.  It smashes through two of the barriers that turn most people off to CCGs: collectibility and deck building.  At the same time, it feels much like a CCG in the game play and offers many of the same joys for the casual gamer.  I can see lots of expansions, imitations, and refinements coming out for this game.  In the meantime, I expect it to get quite a few plays.

I started playing this game much later than I perhaps should have done. It's a better competetive deckbuilder than Thunderstone, but suffers (as some other deckbuilders do) from the relative lack of choices. Your first few turns are generally crucial, and can determine who will win there and then. After that, your choices get less and less important until you're practically playing on autopilot. Thanksfully though, games are generally quite short (20-30 minutes) and some excellent kingdom cards in the later expansions give you tough choices to make.

:indigo: :( :D :) :what: Played this for the first time after an almost one-year hiatus (!) from F2F play (many of my regular playing partners are lukewarm on the game and I got a little burned out on it after playing it [i]a lot[/i]) and I was pleasantly surprised to discover that I found Dominion totally delightful all over again. This is just a brilliant, brilliant design. Games are super-quick (almost filler-length for a two-handed match between experienced players) and every game is very different. Dominion is tilted heavily to the strategy vs. tactics side of the continuum -- there are some luck-of-the-draw elements but matches are only truly a tossup if both/all players pursue the same strategy, and [i]that[/i] is likely as not to be groupthink at work. (There's one best way to do win a given hand, but the odds that both players have instantly hit on the exact same plan are ... remote.)

The theme is less a "theme" than an "excuse" and there isn't much direct interaction -- there are attack cards but they don't pop up in every game and even in games where they're on the board, their efficacy depends on the context. I guess this is why people on BGG are slagging Dominion a bit -- with an assist from the Cult of the New. For my part, I have yet to see a deckbuilder that comes close to being the game that Dominion is. If A Few Acres Of Snow didn't have its *cough* issues, it'd be in the running. Everything else I've played is somewhere between meh and and gawdawful.

I strongly prefer this as a 2-player game; I rate this as a 6 or 7 for three, and a 5 or 6 for four. Never tried with more than four but I strongly recommend breaking into two groups if possible for any group larger than three, as the downtime is considerable.

I haven't tried the more recent expansions: my set of base, Intrigue, Prosperity, Seaside and Cornucopia is more than enough game for my purposes.

Dominion simply has everything I want it to.  Variety in the cards gives it replayability.  Much more than I would ever expect from a single box game.  

It has several hallmarks of a great game
1) makes you feel progressively more powerful over time
2) has a pretty balanced sense of fairness, in players are mostly open to the same opportunities.  
3) The core rules are easy enough to understand.   All the pieces of the game are simple cards, which further reduces complexity.

Super addictive game. It plays fast and different every time. I never thought I would enjoy a deck building game, but this one is a hit.

RATING: 9
+The optimal strategy for most kingdoms is quite difficult to find, requiring some real intelligence and insight
+Near limitless kingdom combinations, especially with expansions means you can't just reuse the same strategy as last game
+Easy to teach to new players
+Easily the most strategic game I've seen popular with non-strategy gamers

-Way too much shuffling; some games I'm shuffling my deck every turn
-The board is the same for everyone, which means you can mindlessly copy another player's strategy without knowing why it works
-Some kingdoms have an extremely simple/obvious optimal strategy, so it comes down to luck who wins (don't be fooled though, luck isn't THAT big of a factor in general)

RATING: 5
Dominion, whether played on BSW or with cards, is essentially video poker as played in casinos: the two games are enjoyable, addictive, rewarding, and ultimately hollow in almost exactly the same ways. The decisions involved in Dominion--broadly, what to buy and when to 'switch' from income to points--map almost perfectly to Jacks or Better's decisions of what to draw and when to cash out. This analogy is so good I can't believe nobody else is using it.

Player interaction is technically present, but every decision in the game is best characterized as a [i]response[/i]. This is common in many efficiency games, but Dominion takes the concept to an extreme that will make some players feel that their presence is only required because [i]someone[/i] has to shuffle the cards. This is difficult to phrase well, but in Puerto Rico each decision is a response to each player's individual board position, including the stock of buildings. In Dominion, the decisions and cardplay of other players are interesting only as inputs into the state of the seventeen stacks of cards on the table (the video poker machine).

Dominion's legs will almost certainly come from subtlety and not depth: it may take hundreds of games to become an expert, but after the first [some low number], players are improving their work on the same set of ideas, not continuing to have new ones.

The amount of shuffling in Dominion is astonishing. Early enthusiasts claim the shuffling is not so bad, but they are wrong. It is absolutely as bad as you fear it is. To play Dominion 2-handed is to accept that you will be shuffling under time pressure for the next fifteen minutes. Multiplayer games aren't as bad because the other players buy you some extra shuffling time.

I like Dominion about as much as I like Jacks or Better, which is a fair amount. Ultimately video poker gets a slight edge because unlike when I play Dominion, after a few minutes of video poker, waitresses start bringing me free drinks.

I'll admit that after many plays you're going to need to pick up one of the expansions to inject some variation you haven't seen before, but the expansions are great anyway.

1 play. Nice, create your engine then convert it to points. Reminded me of St. Petersburg although maybe faster.  I appreciate that. I do like the St. Petersburg art and theme better, but I never decided to buy that game either. I think this is a well made game but I DON'T really feel a desire to play it again so I'm rating it a 5...  Now... again I do think this is a decent game, but... this #6! BGG rating... come on... this game rated above El Grande - ridiculous! That bothers me. That's a BGG game cult crime, in my humble opinion. How is it possible?  It makes me feel old-school and a bit alienated.

My wife's and my favorite game.  We have dozens of plays and it seems I'm still discovering new strategies, which she promptly picks up and uses to beat me in later games.  While it's not the deepest game, it's deep enough to interest gamers and simple enough to appeal to the wife.

This is the first and only all card game I've played and I'm still getting used to it. I've only played twice in a 2 player game with the beginner kingdom cards. So far it was a change of pace but not as exciting as I'd hoped.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.7
One of the predecessors of all deck builders. When it came out it was a super hit. If you have never played this game: it is great! If you have played it a few times: it is great! If you have played it more than 20 times, it's boring.

To say a game gets boring after 20 plays is quite the compliment mind: to be able to so easily pick it up, draft cards and start playing is a rarity in games but once you have played it so much - every game starts looking the same. Head for silver, then gold, then VP, the win.

But I believe that is the only bad point, it is a fun game that is not too stressful yet quite meaty. 

I found this game sometimes infuriated non gamers "How come you won and we basically chose the SAME CARDS!?" and if they have never played, it's tricky telling them that order of purchase, limitation of dross, and ability to "spike" 6-8 gold is important. No doubt they will come to the same conclusions after a good few goes.

Definitely a staple game in my collection now and forever more!

RATING: 6
This was a good choice for us.  Right now we don't have a lot of time to game and this is short, so we can play it, and it is meaty, so if feels like we've played something.

I think the deck building mechanic as a full game is starting to grow stale on us.  That is probably why Ross was not into Quarriors.  This remains a decent game and the best pure deck building game, but we will not attempt to expand it any.

:star::star::star::star::star::star::star:; This is the deck builder. I find it hard to imagine that another game in the genre will ever scratch the efficiency itch for us eurogame fans. I could play each unique combination of 10 kingdom cards so many times. And we haven't even discussed expansions!

RATING: 6.5
See what cards are out there, work out a strategy based on them, with certain combinations maybe react to what people are doing, and shuffle lots.
This game is very quick but doesn't really grab me like games with a bit more depth (I'd pick Race for the Galaxy any day of the week for a card game of this length)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
After having played this a dozen times on the online site, I realize that this game is actually even worse than before.  It's possibly because adding all the expansions just fills it with garbage, but I almost always find myself bored playing the game.  My turns (and others) are either painfully short, or tediously long, and either way I'm never satisfied with the results.  it also has weird jumps, like sometimes the person who jumps to the lead first rockets ahead for the rest of the game, and other times it can be a struggle at the middle, but more often than not it's the first case.

Barely worth the short amount of time it takes to play it.

RATING: 9
Pros:

Still the best of all the deck builders. The delta between the best & worst players is enormous and the depth of the game with expansions is seemingly endless. Even when you play someone far better than you, you come away learning something and will be better for it your next play.

It plays quickly and is great as a 2 or 3 player game. 

Cons:

with 4 players i find it starts to bog down and one of its best qualities fades away. there are rules to play with 5 or 6 in one of the expansions but I'd only play 5 or 6 at gun point.

Without multiple expansions, the game lacks all the depth and lack of luck factor that I just raved about.

The theme is non-existent; Dominion is sort of the chess of deckbuilders; it requires the most skill but it's really an abstract game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
With the base set, once we figured out big money, and countering with the witch, it sort of sucked the fun out and now it rarely hits the table. Initially and 8, lowering to 5. I'm curious if an expansion or two would help?

Received Christmas 2009.  Instantly addictive.  Short learning curve to understand the game...although it does take some time to start to remember what each of the 25 decks do during play (ten are used in each game).  Once everyone gets on to the card abilities game time drops.  Until then, it has been a 60+ minute game.

The suggested "first game" set up is okay to get you oriented...but once is enough and you want to move on quickly.  A random drawing of ten decks is the way to go with this game.  The balance between the card powers and the way they enhance each other when used in a combo is evidence of a well thought out and playtested game.  It gets top marks for that.

It is no surprise that this rocketed into the (BGG) top ten and has stayed there.  This appeals to the masses and delivers a fantastic gaming experience.  The simplicity of the design and ease of learning coupled with the depth of strategic choices make this well deserving of its' status.  This is the first game in a while that keeps calling me back to play just "one more time".

It is easy to see why there is a demand for expansions.  It is not that this game doesn't deliver or needs to be enhanced.  But there is a curious draw to experience what new cards would bring to the game.  I already want to get Intrigue or Seaside...and I have not even begun to exhaust this one.

Top notch game that I am compelled to give a 10; always want to play and expect this will never change.

I suppose it is best to place comments in their respective game entry for the three card expansions: Stash, Black Market and Envoy (in order of preference).  They each seem to have their place.  And, like other cards, they may or may not get purchased because of other options and players' strategies.

Update: as of Jun '10 I own Seaside...and would not play without it.

This game is great, lots of strategies to explore.  I really love it for so many reasons.  But to boil it all down, it's MtG in a small box.  I don't mean the box is small, it's pretty good sized, but you don't have to buy lots of cards and keep up with a meta game to have a good time like you do with a CCG.  

Massive fun and good times, this is the next RftG in my store.  A 'board' game that the CCG players love.

The first few plays of Dominion were sheer joy, but as the expansions kept piling up and piling up, the game lost its lustre and appeal for me. Not that I am obliged to pick up new expansions, but because I realized that the game sorely needs them to create the combinatorial explosion of variability and to alleviate the buying gold strategy. A great gateway game, but not one which I need to play again or own. I am much happier with a meatier deck builder like A Few Acres of Snow or even Concordia.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Dominion brings the pleasure of CCG deckbuilding into the middle of a conventional card game.  The mechanic of constantly changing your deck through play combines with game-to-game differences in available cards to produce a wonderfully strategic experience without sacrificing flow.

The fact that the game is short means that you can easily play several times in one sitting, which allows players to change up the available cards and have different environments to analyze within a compact time period.  The occasional swing due to bad luck is also easily shrugged off due to the short length of any one game.

After a short game or two of learning curve, Dominion boils down to analyzing the card combos that are available - and the number of potential combos grows exponentially with the number of card types.  Expansions will doubtless exploit this phenomenon with practically no end in sight.  I could easily imagine buying expansions for this game for a decade, and loving every one.

Basically, Dominion is my favorite light game - and I don't expect that to ever change.

[edit in 2013: Dominion is still good, but I don't really play it any more due to a shift towards longer multiplayer games and especially the local takeover of Android: Netrunner.]

RATING: 7
This is not a genre that I usually expect to like a lot (card games). The comparisons to Race for the Galaxy delayed my interest, since I don't care particularly for RftG. But I think the similarities are pretty thin. Dominion is its own game.

I only dabbled lightly in CCG, but this one feels like a simplified version of CCG play. There is little direct confrontation, and not a terrible lot of player interaction, but the game was a pleasant surprise for me for one reason alone: my 8 year old son is great at it!

I was surprised at how easily he understood the game, and how good he is at it. He wins about 75% of our match-ups, including 2p or 4p games. I even woke up to find him solo-ing one Saturday morning. For a game that encourages him to read and has some decision-making, this is a great choice. 

The constant need to reshuffle can be irritating. I wish the game could have used draw bags and chits instead, but its tolerable. I doubt the game will have longevity with the regular game group, but he'll definitely be wanting to play this one for a long time.

Dominion is a deck-building based filler that created its own niche when it was originally released. The game is simple: you have a starting deck of coins and VPs. You draw a hand of 5. You can use the coins to buy more coins, VP cards, or actions. Actions break the rules in some way. VPs are useless when you draw them, but you need them to win the game. Purchased cards are put in the discard stack, and you have access to them next time through the deck. The cards are the big variable, before the game 10 action cards are chosen or randomly chosen to be available. These interact in various ways and let players break the rules (i.e.: buying more cards, handing out negative VP cards, allowing players to draw more cards, &c.).

The replayability of this game results from the various potential setups. Players need to evaluate how the various cards chosen for the game will interact and create a deck of cards that can negotiate the terrain most effectively, and this is fairly interesting, though it does tend to fade after a moderate amount of play because many of the cards have effects that are similar and others are situationally dependent on other cards being present, or cards that are better or worse depending on the number of players in the game. Sometimes, decks are best made very thin: so you can churn through the deck and fire off chains of effects quickly. At others, the game can become more reactive, and careful defensive play will carry the day. There are quite a few ways to successfully approach the game, which is one of the things that has made it hold my interest.

The play is very fast, easily in the Race category, easy to crank out in 20-30 minutes for experienced players. What you get in the base box, for me, isn't enough to hold up to endless play, but it's harmless fun and I enjoy sitting down and rolling through a game or two in the present. 

I do find the design pretty impressive though, and I've been playing it on and off as my main filler since it was released. It provides a good degree of variability and fun in a very compact time frame. It's not my very favourite game in its class anymore, but it was an innovator and it has held up pretty well for me. Also, my gf loves it and it is extremely portable once the cards are taken out of the base box and thrown into a standard long box, so some bonus points there.

I was absolutely in loooove with this game when I first started playing it. I love that there are a crazy amount of different game setup combinations, esp with all the themed expansions.
On the flip side, I have become less patient with learning the cards, because we now have pretty much all of the expansions except the latest, and I am not as familiar with some of them.
I also recognized, on a very similar note, that new players are at a great disadvantage for not knowing what each of the cards does. There is usually a lot of deliberating for them, which makes the games way drawn out, and not that fun. 8/10 for accessibility

Earlier I had read a plenty of after action reports and good reviews about this game before I purchased it. I really loved the theme and the design. Then after a few hours of playing I got the final conlcusion: Dominion is not the game I have dreamed of. Despite the hype something is missing from this game. A big disappointment. And not only on my face but on my friends' faces, too. You can say I don't own the expansions. OK you are right, but I believe the basic game should pass the test. Nowadays I look for games only without expansions.

Still one of my favourites, and we haven't got around to buying any of the expansions yet. The mechanics are simple enough for the whole family to get, but deeper strategy is there if you want it. (My daughter, who is 10, loves it and often picks Dominion when it is her turn to choose a game.)

A great game from my exposure so far. There's going to be a lot of different play experiences with all of the different combinations. At the moment I like a mix of Base, Intrigue and Prosperity. I expect this will be getting plenty of play for quite some time.

I really like it. Is it hype? No, I don't think so. Will it last? I think it will. Does it fill some sort of weird deck building facination spot in my game collection? I have no idea, I just know that I like it!

Edit: Rating Dropped 2 full points. It is fun, but feels very samesy after a lot of plays.

Makes for a great couples game because while you are competing against your partner you aren't necessarily attacking them most of the time. I feel more like I am trying to find the most efficient strategy possible with the given cards provided, as opposed to necessarily trying to beat the other players. 

The large amount of card variety increases replay-ability, but there are definitely some cards that shine more than others (as far as I can tell), particularly in a 2 player game. 

Set up time can be a little off-putting.

Scratches that itch for a former Magic: The Gathering player for the combinations in the game.  And it plays really quick too (once the players are familiar with the rules).  Looking forward to the expansions that are obviously coming for the game.  

The "Market" card is perhaps slightly underpriced for what you get for it.  

The only complaints I have are that the text on many of the cards could have been printed larger, the color on the back of the placeholder/randomizer cards should have been more distinct from the normal backs, and some of the artwork is too dark.  (Having said this, none of these minor problems inherently detract much from the game play, but would have been more "user friendly".)

Edit:  Having played with five players (after getting Intrigue), I *never* want to play with five players ever again (and definitely not with six).  Turned a fun game into a miserable experience.

Damn clever game that feels like a CCG in that you build your deck as you play. Since you only play with 10 types of cards at once you can get a lot of interesting game combinations. Also, this thing has a virtually limitless pool of potential expansion and add on cards. I suspect we will see tons and tons of expansions and promotional cards for this puppy.

Scratch the limitless pool of potential expansion opportunities idea. The makes don't want expansions to this. They want to make whole new games to milk this for all it is worth. Lame!

I originally gave it an 8, but after repeated plays it is really starting to bore me. It is still a very good game, but it has grown stale with me. I will play it occasionally, but that is about it. I am downgrading it to a 7 for this. It should get a 6, but it is still a pretty clever and original idea, so I will give it the extra point.

My wife still digs it a lot and teaching it.

Do not touch this game with a 10' pole if you hate shuffling!

I enjoy Dominion, but it hasn't held my attention as much as some deck builders.  It is very well designed and many people love it.  It's easy to learn and often gets replied once pulled out in my experience.  I think it is a fantastic way to break into the deck-building genre of games.  Ultimately, it was a bit too abstract to hold my attention long-term.

Another favorite of ours.  As a newbie to "real" board gaming, I had no idea there were games out there not based entirely on dice rolls and luck.  This game puts everyone at equal footing at the beginning of the game and allows each individual strategy to determine your fate.  The practically innumerable variants in card choices keep on your toes and allow you to constantly discover and develop new strategies.  It revolutionized board games in our lives and opened our eyes to what's out there, and it will always be a centerpiece in our growing collection.

BSW 1 game. less card variety in one game than i expected. Despite being a bit underwhelmed I found myself thinking about strategies afterwards. That is a good sign my rating will go up.

More plays on BSW. Games without cards to increase actions per turn are really slow. I am thinking about strategies for this game and looking forward to playing it again despit not actually thinking it is a very good game...weird.

RATING: 10
Cons:
- Setup before, during, and after can be painful. Have to hunt for 10 specific kingdoms. Have to shuffle a lot during the game.
- Can be lots of downtime if opponent is playing a big combo.

Best Aspect:
The best aspect of Dominion is how elegant it feels. Once you understand the base mechanics it feels very cleanly designed. Victory cards are how you win but they also make your deck worse. This one simple aspect of the game immediately opens up Dominion strategically. The cards in your deck serve a purpose and you get to sculpt and shape that purpose simply by playing the game. 

Of course when playing strategically or competitively, you add or remove cards from your deck that will help you execute your strategy. But the same principle allows you to play with newer players, who don't quite understand any strategy yet, and still have fun. Of course you could blow them out of the water with Big money or chapel, but maybe this time you'll see how fat you can make your garden based deck. Newer players still get to execute their own (bad) strategy and still have fun (witch may ruin this).

Decisions are limited and feedback is incremental. You only have so many cards every turn and so many actions/gold. There are only so many kingdoms you can actually buy this turn. These factors all encourage thinking strategically but at a manageable scope. At the start of the game you pick one strategy based on a couple of kingdoms. Each turn you make small incremental decisions and each turn you get to evaluate your past decisions. RNG helps here as you cannot plan out every following turn just from seeing the starting kingdoms.

Other Pros:
- lots of expansions can help keep the game fresh and the variability of kingdoms large.
- Cards can be quite thematic. Witch curses you by adding worse than useless cards to your deck. The chapel is how you can cleanse yourself of such curses. Of course not all cards are like this and the theme usually falls apart in the context of the entire deck/game.
- As mentioned above can be as competitive or casual as you like it to be. Can be a con if the veteran decides to mercilessly destroy the newcomer.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This is strictly a 2 players game. With more it gets tiresome and imbalanced.
You will like if you played Magic and your life is devoted to the endeavour of finding the combo.

I doubt of its replayability because, event though there are thousands of possible card combinations, the strategies are only participated by a tiny "elite" fraction of the cards. So, there are hundred times less strategies that what may be apparent.

Dominion was one of the very first games I played at Cancon 2012, and so it forms part of my very early board gaming experiences. I remember thinking how clever it was (in terms of design). Have played many games with my wife and others in my family. I like the replayability based on selecting a random deck and also the ability to mix in with the other versions of the game. The game is infinitey expandable, but I think I get enough out of the base game and don't plan buying any of the other versions/expansions.

After a couple years Dominion is just a 'meh' game for me.  Honestly the expansions and people who have studied the game and its multitudes of card combinations have kind of turned me off of it.  I'm just not that into it and now I feel like I'm further removed from being a competitive player.  Still, it's not a bad game at all and being relatively short I'm pretty amicable to giving it a go if that's what others want to play.

An addictive card game in which players build an economic engine for buying victory points.  The card sets used to build the supply for each game can vary wildly, as can the way in which they're used.

WOW!  I thought San Juan was a good game.  This is a GREAT game.  I was wary of the Deck Building, but it's fun.  I like having action cards that you have to be lucky enough to draw, in order to play.  BUT you can mitigate that luck by populating your deck with more of those cards that you want.

RATING: 6
This game looks great and seems like it has lots of replay value and possibilities. However, after playing it a lot, it seems to me to be very one-dimensional. Although it has lots of cards which could change each game, if you want to win you have to avoid collecting too many different kinds of cards. Why? Because they'll slow down your deck and not get you what you need--money to be able to buy Province cards. That's the problem with the game--if you want to win, you have only one basic strategy: collect money fast and buy Provinces. If you buy too many Action cards, you lose. Not much fun after awhile. I've donated my copy of the game to the local University Game Club as they want a copy of the game. Hopefully, they'll have more fun with it than I did! (NOTE: With the release of Thunderstone, I found that it did what I felt Dominion tried to do--and did it better, too! It also has a great theme that works perfectly with the game!)

The legend.  Among our core group of 8 players, 5 players own at least the base set and several expansions.  Of those 5, 3 own the works.  It is a standard go to game, and has nearly eliminated the need for every lighter game we play.  The devastating effect this has had on Ticket To Ride, Alhambra, Settlers of Catan and Carcassone is shocking.  The myriad combinations, the quick turns, the depth of strategy all combine to make this a winner.  Each time the buzz has threatened to die out, a new expansion has been released blowing minds across our collective group.  Dark Ages has started it all over again now.

I thought the theme of the game was kind of dry at first so I gave it a 7 but I changed the rating to an 8 as the game started to grow on me.  My wife loves to play this game with me unless the Witch is present.  She hates to get curse cards.  This is the kind of game that seems very simple at first, but reveals deeper and deeper layers of strategy upon repeated plays.  Lots of variety due to the different combinations of cards available at the start.  I am tempted to get expansions, but the prices are ludicrous.  I will never pay the same price for an expansion as a brand new game.

RATING: 7
The hype was right. This is by no means a tour de force, which might be expected of a game that cracks the top ten, but what it does, it does well, and it does fast. I am VERY appreciative of a game that can be engaging, and play within its documented time of 30 minutes. That, and the enormous variability allowed by the random setup. This could be my new gateway game of choice, if only because it's short enough that you can play multiple times in one sitting, allowing new gamers a chance to "reset" once they get it, rather than suffering through the 2nd half of something, knowing that they didn't really get it during the first half, and wishing they could start over. But the constant shuffling kills me. As does the excessive number of expansions. I haven't bought any flavors and don't plan to.

Finally played face 2 face on Nov. 1st 2008 at union.  Some decks play better with 2 players than others.  I like the "big money" setup with 4 players, and the "interactive" with just 2.  Need to remember that with only 2 players the number of VP's is reduced.  I like it on BSW but F2F gives the game a hectic more fun quality.  The game is an AWESOME "super filler".  The rules are simple but there is strategy involved.  Plus the possibility of expansions means this rating may go even higher.  Starting it at an 8.5 because while there are many other games I might rather play this is one I would almost never turn down.
After 100+ plays I have up'd the rating from 8.9 to 9.2.  I've played it 100 times and I still want to keep playing it.

One of our original gateway games along with Catan. Loved it for a long time, but deckbuilders don't last very long on our shelf, and Dominion was no exception.

I will still play it occasionally, but have no desire to keep it on the shelf.

We really enjoy this game, but after about ten plays we got a little tired of it.  For one thing, it takes a bit too long (for us) to pull out all the decks and put them back again at the end of the game.  Also, we have a friend who doesn't care about winning as much as making the most complicated hand possible.  ("Okay, I'm going to play this card which gives me two actions and then I'm going to play this card that gives me extra draws. And then this card gives me more actions and then I can draw more cards..." etc.)

I am not one for growth games, let that be known before you read my comment. I dislike the way in which they move the game forwards (by simply causing growth and thus advancement to happen in a positive feedback loop); I dislike the way in which small differences in the early beginnings grow and enlarge, making catching up very difficult; and I dislike the insane amount of attention such games get as a general rule. Dominion is a growth game, so it will not ever score high with me. Now, in Dominion's defense, I will say a few things which I sort-of liked based on the single time I played. First, it is quick. Second, the growth mechanism is easy enough for me to understand it, which is a prerequisite if I am to play these games more often. Third, there are very little differences to enlarge as players do not draw from a common pool which runs out easily—it's all their own creativity. Fourth, the idea is very original to say the least. All in all, things which  help me appreciate the game more than its other growth brethren.

But.

But for one issue. The game causes an [i]insane[/i] amount of card manipulation. My girlfriend and I were playing at such a high speed at some time that we felt that all we did was shuffling cards. Yes, the decks grow, and the shuffling becomes less. But the basic play-draw mechanism is so quick that shuffling still provides the big break in this routine. We were very glad we were done with this game, and neither of us felt the need to try again. Perhaps in computer form, where all you need to do is click on cards, the game is better. But when played F2F, I cannot derive enjoyment from this game, and will actively avoid it to the point of refusing to participate in a game and doing something else, like reading a book, instead. Dominion is not broken as far as I could tell (although experienced players will undoubtedly hit on killer strategies), so it won't get the lowest possible rating.

[b]Update[/b] Retry, this time with 3. You know what it is that I don't like about Dominion? It's that it obliterates a somewhat interesting strategical problem of how to best 'grow' a deck of cards by excessive tactical micromanagement interleaved with that infernal cycle of shuffling, redrawing, discarding, and shuffling again. Really, humans have creative brains: let them program a strategy into a computer Core War-style (see [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_War]here[/url]), and pit various strategies against each other, with the computer doing the boring rest of testing the strategies several million times. I'm still planning to avoid the mechanism as much as I can.

Since I got my start in gaming with the old Star Wars CCG, the deck building/drafting aspect of this game fits very well with my tastes. The game is quick, with very little down time for players, and a fair amount of interaction. This is just the second game ever to debut at the #2 spot on my top 10 list. It quickly fell as I was unable to win, but still, its a keeper, for sure.

Purchased December 2008.

Hype.  Hype.  Hype.

Played a prototype around Origins time frame and really enjoyed it.  Played 3 games straight.  Bought instantly once it was released.

So far this one is winning on the wife front.  She said this game is very easy and that she enjoyed it.  Only problem is that she would rather not play with me.

See lots of parallels with Saint Petersburg and Magic.  Both games I thoroughly enjoy.  This time next year, I for-see this game being the game I've most played. 

January 2009 - Took less than a year (only two months).  This is my most played game.

A game with interesting possibilities and a very high amount of variation/replayability, but sometimes it feels like your fate is too determined by the luck of the draw. This is a game we enjoy periodically but we don't usually play it in long stretches.

I should probably rate this an 8, but it gets an extra 0.5 for getting so many dang plays, and for getting my wife interested in something other than Rummikub.

I've not tried the other deckbuilders, nor do I see any need to. I've got Prosperity and Seaside, and would love to pick up Intrigue and Hinterlands at some point.

Sure there's some sameness, but that just means you've played one-too-many games that evening. There's no other game my wife will play five or six times back-to-back. This is partly because she'll win four of them, but even Lost Cities stops at three.

I'd say this is in my top-5 all time.

This is one of my most played games and I really enjoy it.

My favorite thing about Dominion is that it is hoards of fun even when you're losing.  I love the mechanic of looking at the set of cards, deciding what you think the optimum path (or in some cases, most fun path) to victory is, and then trying to execute it.  That much fun packed into 30 minutes is a treat.  I do think it can suffer from the "everyone playing alone" syndrome because it plays so quickly -- it can be hard to watch what other people are doing and still be ready for your turn.  Depending on the players, this can make for poor table feel.

Back in 2009, before really diving into boardgames again, I stumbled upon this when searching a birthday gift for my brother. Quick to play, great mechanics, an instant classic. Also, if you're into semi-autistic deck-shuffling, this one is for you.

RATING: 8.25
Play this all the time with my coworkers. This game is excellent.  I love all the tons of combos and trying to figure out what the best combos are on any given board. Game is best with players of similar skill level since having some knowledge on how to balance cards in your deck and knowing what the stronger cards are gives you a huge edge over new players.

Downside of this game is that the random setups can vary wildly in how fun they are, how much strategy there is, how much luck there is, how interactive/mean they are, and how long they take.  If a great set of cards comes out, this game is AMAZING.  If a terrible set of cards come out, the game can be just way less fun.

Ugh, like playing solitaire with friends. Why is this so highly rated? Oh yeah, Fanboy(S) of card collecting, deck building.

We did like the fast pace and changing shifts in choices you have to make. I wanted to see a bit more interaction in the game, but that was partly due to the card sets we ended up picking - only the Bureaucrat and Spy came up as attack cards. Upon more plays my opinion is softening, I see some potential and I like that it's quick.  The more variety I have in the cards we play with and the number of players, the more I enjoy it.  My rating has increased 3 times so far.

This is a great 2 (or 3) person game. The best part is that I am always anxious to play again - even after just finishing a game. I suspect that we'll play this game a lot in the coming years. The downside is that the game can take a while to set up and it takes a while to understand the rules of certain cards. When we are using new cards or haven't played in a while, we'll spend too much time reading and re-reading the rules for a given card. This can be a drag on the player experience. 

8/8/2012 2:34 PM - setup time has turned out to be a big deal. We tend to play games w/ less set up time. 

9/2015 - I've been convinced I don't play this game enough. I'm going to push to play more this fall.

Dominion has a surprising amount of strategy involved, which isn't immediately apparent on your first few plays. How you play and plan has to adapt to the cards that are in play - a different combination each time, which meant every game I played felt different even though they were always against the same people. The only downside to Dominion, and the reason I no longer own it, is that the set up can sometimes be longer than the game itself leaving it often sat on the sidelines at game night. That and the fact that the urge to spend money on the expansion packs is overwhelming.

Dominion was the game that got me back into board games. Now, I just like Dominion. I am really burnt out on this game and deck building games in general. Everyone seems to be putting out deck building games now and they are all pretty much the same. I like how quick this games plays--even though it takes forever to set up. I wish the theme was stronger as well. It has medieval looking pictures, but they really don't have anything to do with the game. Its just a card game. The strategy is easy to get as well and some cards I never play because they don't fit into the strategy that wins. I will still play this game, but I have found other games that hold my interest for longer.

This is one of the only purchases I have made based on (largely-justified) hype. I appreciate the innovative deck-building mechanism but I am not entirely convinced that this game has more depth than breadth.

While the variety of kingdom cards certainly provides players with many different options, I really don't know if having all these options makes this a great game. San Juan, for example, seems to have much more depth with fewer cards and a brilliant role-selection mechanic.

With Dominion, the jury is still out, but I do have fun playing it.

Like so many others, I'm hooked on this game.  It's fast.  It's variable.  The real trick seems to be judging how to value the available cards each game, and spending wisely.

RATING: 9
Already a modern classic! :)
It excels at the innovative introduction of two mechanisms:
1. Very variable game setup due to the choice of 10 different kingdom cards that the game consists of in every game. 10 out of 25 in the base game and out of a whopping 234 when playing with all expansions (through Adventures) and promo kingdom cards (through Prince). Every game is different, thus very high appeal to play over and over again!
2. The deck construction that happened prior to the game in other games so far *is* the game in Dominion!

It is great that the designer is very active and readily answer questions on the [url=http://forum.dominionstrategy.com/]Dominionstrategy forums[/url] and here at BGG! :)

What I don't like about the official Dominion is the hidden trackable information (HTI) and thus the incentive to tediously memorize cards. Which is why I am an avid proponent of deck counters in online Dominion. Read more about my general stance on HTI in my profile.

This is my most played game of all time with close to 7.000 games (most of them online and with expansions). But I am still eager to play more, it hasn't lost its appeal (except for the loss of appeal due to the abysmal Goko online implementation, of course).
Dominion is that good and provides that kind of long-term versatility with all expansions! :)

So my rating of 9 is for the base game only, together with all expansions it is a 10 for me (reflected in ratings of 9.5 and 10 for most of them) - even in spite of the HTI! :)

Having now played enough to understand some of the subtleties, I appreciate the game even more - although I understand the complaints about how "select a strategy" is the lion's share of the game, with actual play being secondary, I do feel like there's enough course correction / reaction to other decks to make it more than just an extremely long scoring round. :)

RATING: 5.3
The process is too dull. The game is too variable and loose and this results in bad rounds.

The framework underpinning it chokes the more interesting spice that you sometimes discover. 

I don't want more buys, more cards, more actions or a richer more weeded deck anymore. Too easy. Too dull. 

I would sell all of Dominion. I would never ask to play it again. The problem was not just my knowledge level or the strategies I employed during the game. The problem is that there is too much basic framework in the game and it makes it dull. And playable. 

I have better games.

I find Dominion challenging to play yet simultaneously dull. At this time, with the competing games I have on my shelf, that just isn't good enough. I need more fun out of a game than Dominion offers.

RATING: 8.1
Adaptation, variety, creative thinking, but I find the only enjoyable player interaction is competition for desirable cards. The curse mechanic *is* kind of interesting, but I don't like it because it isn't about figuring out interesting counter strategies so much as it just junks up your opponent's strategy, regardless of what it is.  Still a good game.

Very crispy crackers. That's what I call it. It fast, and light. Sometimes brutal, sometimes in abundance. So many things to be. The game manipulates deck building mechanic with power about... well, manipulating the mechanics. Seems too dry for my taste.

RATING: 5
Dominion's deck-building mechanic is brilliant in its conception and simplicity, and it intuitively appeals. But the actual game turns out to be pretty bland and disappointing, primarily because its narrative structure is completely in opposition to the ideal for a game. The most important and interesting decisions occur at the very beginning; by design, later choices have an ever-shrinking impact as your deck grows in size. By the midpoint, gameplay devolves into playing out your hand mechanically, and purchase choices are completely defined.

It doesn't help that setup for this game is quite fiddly and can take a third or half as long as the actual game, and that the constant shuffling is an irritant. The theme is also so innocuous as to be absent, and the card designs suffer from a number of usability issues. And the game has a strong starting player bias and offers little compensation for this. I foresee another game coming along soon that refines the core mechanics of Dominion into a much more textured and tense game.

This game can be kind of good, but I simply don't like the "solitaire" feeling (even with the interactive cards). Maybe some day I will give it another chance, but for now it's 5 for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Components: Nice artwork and clear iconography. The shear number of cards is a bit of overkill (the game could come with far fewer copper cards, for instance), but most of my plays are with two players, so I might just not have a grasp of how many cards come into circulation with more players. The compartmental insert is greatly appreciated; yes, it's still difficult to find a particular card type (even with the handy divider label), but I much prefer this to just a stack of cards, or bagging them all separately.

Experience: Very fast-paced, to the point of it being my turn again before I've even refreshed my hand. An exciting, frantic race.

It is a lot of fun to draw a hand of five cards and play it out. I like a lot of luck in my games, to give me something to blame when I lose, and to present me with fresh choices at every turn. For any given hand, this game delivers on the luck, but that luck, in the long run, is tightly controlled by the buying choices I make. I'm hardly ever forced to add a card to my deck, nor is a card often forcibly removed from my deck, so most of the cards in my deck are there by my choosing, and so I'm usually thrilled with all the cards I draw each turn.

Playing action cards is mostly straight-forward; I don't mind that; it is the payoff from having bought them, i.e. I only bought them so that I could play them, and now I'm getting to play them. Buying cards is more thought-provoking. In many cases I can still do it on auto-pilot, but even the simplest of such decisions are balanced by the fact that the decisions happen quickly and frequently, and thus aren't individually burdened with carrying the weight of whether I enjoy the game or not. The sum of those 20+ decisions over the course of the game is definitely enjoyable. 

There are only a few action cards that allow for direct player interaction, which is fine with me. In most games I like to build my own sandcastles and not have them knocked down by others. And of course I must watch what my opponent is doing and adjust accordingly, just as in Race for the Galaxy.

I've read a few comments recently that suggested some players might not always buy a Province if able. So far I've never passed up this chance, even early in the game, or even if the card is the penultimate Province card. Gardens aside, with 8 copper and any number of buys it is the best bang-for-my-buck, and only pollutes my deck with one non-actionable card. Thus far, having 5+ Provinces in a 2 player game has always been a trait of the winning player (5 Provinces to my opponent's 3 being a 12-point swing), so it seems advantageous to grab these as aggressively as possible.

Recently started playing a variant whereby each player has five random types of kingdom cards uniquely available to them, and am really liking this variant. It prevents any sort of mirroring strategy, and with fewer choices I often employ kingdom cards that would not have looked as attractive among twice as many of its peers. If I had to pick the single thing I most enjoyed about all games, I'd probably say it's the “work with what you've got” challenge of card games, and this variant delivers on this even more than does the initial constraint of 10 kingdom cards, but still leaves enough options available to me for interesting decisions.

Update: Despite Dominion being a great game, I don't think I'll play it anymore, as Thunderstone scratches the same mechanism itch, but with so much more that I enjoy. But I'll probably always have a soft spot in my heart for Dominion.

The game "works", no doubt, but reminds me of knitting, somehow, as your hands find themselves being busier than your brain.  There isn't a whole helluva lot going on here - buying cards in order to increase your ability to buy cards.  No scope, no drama, no intriguing context - just cards begetting cards.

This game is a great deck building game. It was the first board game I got when first getting into gaming and I am really happy that I chose it. You can pull off awesome combos to just play card after card on your turn and then ending by having your own Dominion that is far greater than that of all your enemies!

A good enough game, I enjoy it, the artwork is a little boring, and the insert looks nice but rather pointless as you only use ten decks .

Certainly card gamers would score this game considerably higher.

Great game system. I can recommend the base game as an introduction, but be aware that once you hit 20-30 plays, the game starts to feel stale. Fortunately, the quality of the many expansions fixes this. None of my other games will probably ever hit the number of plays Dominion has due to the ease of teaching, quick play and the satisfaction of seeing a well tuned deck do it's thing.

Rating is for Dominion as a whole, which I guess is kind of unfair.

We have alot of fun playing dominion. there are sooooooo many possible grouping of cards that the game is always different. I would like to see a defensive card introduced to the game. something like an estate you can buy and will give you a point at the end of the game or you can use it to defend against an attack card and it then gets discarded from the game.

A friend raved Dominion so we got.  I thought it was okay but didn't understand her raving.

Now I picture the game is more like what my friend was recommending.

RATING: 6
The problem seems to me, that despite the multiple ways of getting there, it all boils down in the end to getting the scoring cards as this is the only way to win points. Also with 4 players, even at about 30 minutes length, some of the games I have played felt a bit too long. I can see playing this as a single game at the beginning or end of a session, but not multiples. Maybe my opinion would be different for games with fewer players.

Downgraded now I have Trains.

I love this game. I love the fact that everyone has the same cards to purchase so there is little randomness to it. The only randomness is how you draw your cards from your deck. Other deck building games are fun, don't get me wrong. But I still think Dominion is better. I may be wrong but I think that people who don't like Dominion any more haven't tried the expansions. Those add a lot a variation to the game. I LOVE IT!! :p

RATING: 3
Fun to play, but I'm not a huge fan of deck building, and I'm not sure I'll play this all that often for that reason.  However, it's FAST and it is EASY and several members of my family REALLY LIKE it, so I will probably end up playing it a lot more than I expect.

Update: Initial rating of 6 from 2008.  Now it's a 3.  In the intervening six years or so I have never played it.  The box is gathering dust on the shelf.  I am pretty confident I'll never play it again, thank goodness.  The rating of 3 means "Bad."  I'm OK with calling this game bad.  If it were better TO ME, I would have played it at least once in six years.  

If you like it, good for you.

Alex's game (main game and expansions scored as a single unit). It's been so long since I've played these now that it was hard to rate, but the BGG recommended rating definitions helped me make the call to give them a 7. Except for the first 2-3 games of a new main box, we always played these using cards from across the whole set (there was a fantastic card selector/randomiser app that someone designed that we always used) so I couldn't rate them separately if I tried

At first when you start playing it seems a little boring as you are trying to figure out how to build your deck, but after a certain tipping point, it starts moving very quickly and then its finished and you're sitting there thinking...."man I should have done this instead of this." A really fun game that grows on you with unlimited. re-playability.

RATING: 7
Well, this is really a very good game. I think it fixes the problem magic had by being a really very good card game but without the huge expense.  It also fixes the problem in magic of whoever spends the most on cards wins.  In Dominion all players share the card resource equally.  Of course, I do miss the depth of thought that one could invest in magic outside of the actual game, in Dominion there is little dreaming of the optimum decklist for the current and ever-changing environment. At £30 rather than £3000 though, I am happy with Dominion.

Multi-player solitaire - in the games we played no-one looked further than their own deck and the piles of cards lying on the table. I am sure there is a deep interactive strategy game here, which requires memorising every card that each of the other players has bought and relating it to how they shuffle their decks and the cards they have already played. I don't think I can be bothered.

Extraordinary game with beautiful and elegant mechanics. It can be learned in five minutes but offers an extremely deep strategic experience.

Use cards from your deck to get more cards which can improve your deck's function *or* earn victory points.  How do you want your deck to function?  How can you best get it to do that?  Will that get you enough VPs by the time the game ends?  

Fun enough, but didn't have that spark for me.

I bought this largely based on the hype surrounding it here on BGG and other forums, and I have to say I'm glad I did. Dominion is quickly becoming one of our go-to games. The length is perfect, a well-balanced combination of skill and luck is needed to win, and the kingdom card randomization is a great feature that keeps the game from becoming stale. Highly recommended.

The lack of theme and the multiplayer solitaire never bothered me at all.

Excellent gateway game.

Will feel familiar to anyone who has ever done deck-building, and vaguely familiar to anyone who has played simple card games like Uno or Go Fish.

Excellent replayabililty; as not all cards will be used each game, each game will feel different for a good number of games. 

Expansions
Although there are many wonderful expansions available, start out with just the base game, there is plenty of entertainment to be had! If you really enjoy it, buy one (or if you must, two) expansions at a time to freshen the game up if it begins to feel stale. Many people will be very happy to own only the base game or maybe one expansion. You do not need them all to have a great time playing.

Notes
Highly recommend sleeving your cards as you will be shuffling a LOT. Even if you shuffle gently, you will avoid stress watching friends shuffle while playing your game.

Many years ago, I got very crazy about Dominion. My completionist syndrome acting up as well, so I hunted expansion after expansion and promo after promo. The turning point came with the Alchemists. I simply couldn't justify to myself to shelf out more money. And, to be honest, I did have enough expansions to make setup a chore, even with the app.

But then I realised that we were essentially playing multiplayer solitaire. True, there are a few cards that make you do stuff to your opponent, but most of the times it's a simple race for VPs and turning cards on your own. Now, my copies are sitting in my shelf, collecting dust and waiting to be sold.

Perhaps I simply over-indulged.

A soulless and pointless game.  By "pointless" I do not mean "not worth playing".  I mean literally that there is no point.  You optimize your deck so you can optimize your deck better in order to optimize your deck.  But then you never DO anything with it.  It needs an objective badly, and then it could maybe not feel so bland.

I do give the game credit for coming up with a very good new mechanic, it just failed to do anything cool with it.

Have yet to turn down a game.  I love that it tickles my strategy nerve, but is light enough to finish in under 30 minutes!  While the theme could be almost anything, its original theme offers a very nice visual appeal.

This is the game that turned me on to deck-building games.

I have since taken a preference to deck-builders like those put out by Cryptozoic.  They just flow better, in my opinion...too many worthless turns in Dominion.

RATING: 6
This is a very good deck building game that I do enjoy.  It doesn't get a lot of play mainly because I do not have the Dominion Prosperity expansion which adds 5 coin denominations and a higher point card. IMHO, that expansion greatly improves the experience of playing Dominion.  While I like regular Dominion without Prosperity, it's just not quite as good.

The simplicity does wonders in catering to all gamers - yet it has the complexity to offer the hardcore types.  It's fast too, and allows for socializing, and because of the randomization it can be a different game every time if you want which makes the replayability endless.  Love this game!

Absolutely LOVE this game.  This is the funnest game I have played.  First play rank was 7/10 but after about the 3rd play (knowing what I was doing) 10/10.  I was playing 3-6 times per day.  Come home from lunch and play.  I have since purchased intrigue, seaside, hinterlands, prosperity.  Replay value is almost infinite.  Just with base set there are 3 million different combinations.  Prosperity is a must.  This is the most addictive game I have played.  I have well over 300+ plays and it's still fun.  There is an app for smart phones call Androminion which is where about 1/2 of my play time has come from.  Everyone we've introduced this game to loves it and half buy there own set.  I am not a card game fan but this game is very very fun.  Even haters like this game.  10/10 still after hundreds of plays.

Amazing game! I own all the expansions, all of them flow together to create a very different experience each time. The thing I love about it is it forces you to determine a brand new strategy every time. No one best way to play EVER! And eveen with great strategy, timing and luck still keep things fair. Each decision just skews the odds a little better or worse in your favor.

I think I would find Dominion a lot more fun if it weren't for that one guy. Oh, you don't know that one guy? I'm talking about that one guy who sits down at the table and immediately identifies the best combination of cards to play and then flawlessly executes it, absolutely decimating everyone else at the table. I've played a lot of games of Dominion and they've never lacked that one guy. Maybe I could put more effort into avoiding that one guy but I think the fact that he's kind of ubiquitous says something problematic about the game: there is a right answer. And if you don't immediately know what it is, you're probably not going to have much fun.

If you were a Magic: The Gathering player, prepare to get angry, because today's kids can get the fun of deck-building and finding effective card combos without spending $3.99 on a booster pack full of useless commons.

This game is, however, a victim of its own success because I've played it so many times that I don't really feel like playing it again.  And to be honest, I wouldn't play it without at least the Intrigue expansion.

On it's own, the base set of Dominion is probably closer to an 8.5. It is a fantastic game distilled down to the foundation. Unlike many games, the more expansions added to Dominion, the better. Getting the first two expansions (Intrigue and Seaside) bump the game into the upper echelons. 

Expansions will be rated relatively to other expansions. Dominion as an overall experience is easily a ten.

I wanted to buy a game that plays well with 2 as it is mainly my wife and I that play but to get value out of it I wanted to ensure it up-scaled and played well with 3 or 4 so the kids could play. I took a risk with this as Lisa had watched the game being played in a shop and was a bit put off by not really being able to follow what was going on. But I bit the bullet and bought it anyway and I am glad I did. After 1 play through Lisa got it and enjoyed it and has already started getting guarded about her intended tactics for the next game. Yesterday we played with the kids who also loved it first time and when I went to work my daughter and Lisa played 3 games back to back using some of the different Kingdom cards. This has never happened before. I am convinced we will get value out of this as my daughter was also asking if there were any expansions! 

Update - We had a lot of plays of Dominion but it does not now feature as one of our 'go to' games as it used to.

A great game that changes every time you play when you mix and match different cards. The variety and large amounts of card keep the game interesting and it just gets better with the expansions.

Finally got a chance to play this big BGG-hit.
The thing I like is the deck-building mechanism. At first it feels weird to discard and reuse all you cards, but after a while you realize it's all about deckbuilding. Another interesting aspect is when to stop buying "money-maker" and start buying victory points.

However, the game lasted a pretty long and felt too repetetive after a couple of turns. Furthermore, interaction is very limited. I've been told interaction improves with the uses of more advanced cards, but not too much. The fun I had playing the game resulted from funny remarks of fellow players critizing the game - not from gameplay itself.

The final verdict: novel and interesting deck-building mechanism, but not I game I'd like to play on a regular basis.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Next to Marvel Legendary, and maybe Thunderstone, this is my favorite deck builder. Yes, you can fall into more of a solitaire type of game where you basically buy what you want and try for the most points without a lot of player interaction. If that's a problem, add some attack cards to mess with other players.

The theme is really enjoyable and well put together. Some combinations (especially when you add in expansions) seem a bit OP and broken. The mechanics are pretty simple to pick up and play with even for younger kids. They may not be great at it, but it's something they can understand and have fun with.

Biggest drawback to me is that when someone hits on the best strategy for a given layout, there's not much you can do to stop them. They get their engine rolling and it's just a matter of time before they buy out the Provinces.

Still a game I love playing, but I find it best in groups who can just casually enjoy a game with some dessert, a warm drink, and some conversation.

This game plays well with two to five players. Although sometimes maligned as group solitare, I enjoy assessing the card tableaux and finding a way to make it work. There are so many different combinations of cards, it makes for a puzzle to be solved. Liked it so much, got Intrigue and then Seaside.

RATING: 8
Dominion is a cold, calculating euro at heart but somehow manages to appear like something else. What I really love about it though is setting the game up, looking at the available kingdom cards and figuring out what I'm going to do this time. Dominion is both a strategic game (which cards will you buy) and a tactical one (how you play your hand). Experimenting with card combos is a lot of fun, especially with the expansions where some really crazy things can happen. I can see why Dominion has won all possible board game awards, as it really does deserve them.

I can see why so many people love Dominion but I have never found it fun personally. I don't like to shuffle a small deck of cards again and again. I find the theme to be non-existent. The game boils down to a pure math game: buy these cards that'll let me play these other cards that'll let me buy these point cards. I wouldn't mind an abstract game if the mechanics are either simple or innovative, but Dominion seems to be both dry and needlessly complicated. There are so many different types of cards, each of which does some variation of a few functions. Experienced players have seen all the card sets and memorized the optimal combos, so they steamroll newbies because a small improvement in card-play efficiency gradually builds up to an insurmountable lead. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A simple, fun card game that has a ton of underlying strategy.  I enjoy it over CCG like M:tG because every player starts with the same hand and access to the same cards.  Also, a one time purchase gives me all the cards I need for a lot of variation and strategy.

This game plays just like collectible card games, except there is nothing to collect.  That is a victory for the gamer since the biggest downside of collectible card games is the cost and the inevitable "arms race" that occurs between friends, and neither of those situations occurs in Dominion.

In a nutshell, you all build decks while actually playing the game, using community provided cards.  Awesome!

The problem with this game is the usual problem with all card games; card counting.  Yes, you get to break out those Rainman like memorization brain cells and attempt to maximize your deck.  You do not have to card count, but if your opponents can and do (like mine), you basically have no choice if you want to keep up.  While not game breaking, it is a problem.

No theme, lots of shuffling, boring samey games. Somehow even with changing out the kingdom cards, it never really feels any different. It's just draw cards, play cards, buy cards, rinse repeat. There's no engine you can build that you can count on, unless you do some drastic card trashing. And even then, everyone is probably doing the same thing you are so it turns into a race of who can trash fastest. Just not fun for me.

I had very high hopes on this game, but it is a great disappointment. Totally lacks atmosphere, dull cards hand management and very annoying shuffling.

And oh God, are we really the rulers of a Kingdom???????????

This is my wife's favorite game.  We play on isotropic quite a bit (though we have the cards too, the logged plays are with the physical cards).  There is a lot of replay value in this game; with random kingdom cards, there's always different strategies to try out.

We include the expansions when we play.  I would rank them:
1) Prosperity
2) Seaside
3) Alchemy
4) Intrigue
Take this with a grain of salt; there are cards from Intrigue that I like more than cards from Prosperity (Bridge >> Loan), but this is the general feeling.

A wonderful, wonderful game.

Prominently features the card-evaluation that makes me love drafting Magic. Witnessing your deck mutate whilst playing appeals to my 'nurturing' side. Running through the deck so many times, ensuring all cards are played roughly equally, minimises luck. 

I firmly blame my loss on the fact that we thought there were more of a certain card, so I was planning for a longer game. (Near the end, it turned out they'd been wrongly laid out.)

A great deck-building card game.

Early in my experience my group and I would try and build machines using lots of kingdom cards.  Then I read about the money deck, and ever since that was shared with the group, we've realized how it makes the game pretty predictable--especially since it has a great chance of winning every time.

I miss the days of finding combos for the kingdom cards...

The game that apparently started the whole deck-building genre? Well, thanks for that, I guess; now you can go away.

This game has no theme. The only attempt at a theme just amounts to a light hand-wave. The art is very bland and elementary. And with every expansion, the art not only gets worse, but it feels like they purposefully ask the artists to make art as bad and different as possible from any of the previous art, so none of it matches either.

There's rarely anything to do while you wait for other players to take their turns. Nor a great deal of interest in what they are doing.

The cards themselves, regardless of how you choose the ones for your session, are mostly useless. There always seems to be one clear dominant strategy. And in general the basic money cards are the best buy. Which sort of makes it absurd and repetitive not just during each play, but from play to play. The variety by changing card sets is somewhat an illusion.

The base game is just very dull. It's made decent by one or two of the better expansions. But then they went and made that a mockery too with the endless stream of expansions that are mostly filler.

I normally don't care for themeless, storyless games, but Dominion is an exception. Every combination of cards that make up a game is a puzzle to be solved, and a race to see who can solve it first. The simplicity of the basic structure hides what builds over the short playing time into sometimes very elaborate game play. I thought the original game was interesting but rather bland, but the addition of cards in the expansions made it much more interesting to me.

Awesome.  My rating is for the dominion series as a whole.  This game gets exponentially better with expansions.  I agree that just the base set will get old after a while, and when comparing just the base set to newer deckbuilding games, it has been surpassed. But if you are willing and able to bring a few expansions into the mix, Dominion is a solid 10 for me.  It's addictive and makes my heady feel all zingy!

I just played this game again recently after a few years of avoiding it. This recent game just reminded me how much I hate this game. In the future, I'll find something else to do while the rest of my friends play this. So little decisions for all the effort of constant shuffling. Barf. 

For the most part, I enjoy the games in the top spots here on BGG, so I value the rating system. However, in this case, I strongly feel that this game does not belong in the top 10 here on BGG (I'm disappointed in my fellow BGGers ;) ). I guess my interest in deckbuilding died when I stopped playing Magic the Gathering and Jyhad (1995).

Одна из любимейших. С одной стороны, простые и доступные правила, небольшое время партии, с другой достаточно большая глубина игры и спортивность. Единственное что - в базовой версии уже становится скучновато, но проблема должна решиться приобретением дополнений.

Money sink. I refuse to buy a card game for what they charge for this. Also, don't like games that add too many expansions, with no end in sight. 

The only real decisions are what cards to buy. Otherwise, the hand plays itself.

Intro to Deckbuilding

Own the Dominion Big Box set due to the value.

Pros: Good card stock, pioneered the deckbuilding-as-a-game mechanism. Engine building and hand management blend into a fun game of deciding when and how to buy victory point cards to end the game. Lots of replayability here with the variable setup of cards.

Cons: Dry theme. Card sorting and storage can be a challenge. The Big Box version has dedicated slots but the box is huge and you would never want to store it sideways.

Fast and Easy deck-builder. Can't go wrong with this game especially if you want to play a couple of lightning rounds like we do every so often, sometimes getting in 3 games in a single hour. Played just the base game quite a few times and still don't feel the need for any of the numerous expansions (although I do still want them).

As my friend put it, dominion is not a game. Dominion is a mechanic. Here we have a brilliant idea for a mechanic, but not a game yet. Other people have taken his idea, and from it created great games. 

Another one I used to like but now don't.

Catan has the title of my "gateway" game, but Dominion is responsible for lighting the flame of obsession in my life.  The deck-building mechanic was completely new to my gaming friends and myself, and once we caught on we really enjoyed it.  It was amazing back when I first tried it, and with the expansions, it never seems to get old.  I love that endless variety, and that each new game is a chance at trying something new.  Another plus for me is that is plays very well as a 2 player game.  I prefer 3-4 players (have played with 5-6 and that makes for much too long a game IMO), but 2 player games work well for me.  One common complaint from friends is that "experience" with the cards gives too great an advantage, and I do agree to a point.  There are a few "can't pass up" cards that an experienced player will know about, but I usually share that information before each game in an attempt to even the playing field.  At the moment, this still holds the place of "favorite game".  I love it.

RATING: 9.2
I love dominion, the deck building mechanic is probably my favourite mechanic in any board game and dominion does it very well without be overly complex.  The base game is just a little bit stale on its own though, as most of the cards are fairly straightforward and it's difficult to really be creative in your card selection.

Current Expansions:

Prosperity
Intrigue

Awesome card based game.  So many options with all the different cards you can set up for the game.  Plays relatively quick.  There is a downside - when one player gets on a run with laying multiple action cards down and spends several minutes sorting their turn out and you really don't have anything to do.

We enjoyed this game, but we felt it would require several of the expansions to make it really shine. We just felt that that would be too large an investment for us to spend that much, especially when there are a lot of other quality deckbuilders out there now.

RATING: 7.5
(2010)
(Barely play the boardgame, but play a lot on the phone: androminion)

For 2 - 4 players. Nonetheless we have played 5 people without much of a problem.

Dec 2011: Very good game. We randomly pick 10 (out of 25) Kingdom cards and play with them, having always different games.
We usually tend to build Action Decks.

Jan 2014: Now I tend to buy just 4-5 action cards, the rest is money. Usually I never buy Duchys (maybe in late game) but Provinces. If possible (chapel, steward, trading port) I try to clean my deck. If "curses" are present, I always try to send them to other players at the beggining (Witch, Torturer...). Market, Laboratory and Militia are always good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a wonderful game.  Easy to teach and by the end of their first game a new player has worked out what they did wrong and wants to play again.  Great replay value when combined with an action card randomizer to subtly change the game each time you play.

Update: New players I've introduced to this haven't been as enthralled recently and I think it's because we've only had time for a single play.  I think it needs a couple of plays to hook people in.

RATING: 5
Dominion doesn't excite me like I thought it would. I can see the reasons many people thoroughly enjoy this game, but each time I've played I'm bored. Even when getting random deck possibilities out on the table with the kingdom cards, I'm still not excited to play. My game group likes it, so I know I'll play it more, but it just isn't my kind of game. It's never a good sign that even during a fast game I'm still wondering when it will end.

I'm still willing to be persuaded on this one and keep coming back to it.

However, having got into gaming about 2 years after Dominion's explosion, I'm not sure that I'll ever be sold. 

Essentially, it's a puzzle game: experienced players will look at the available cards and instantly know the best combinations to aim for. Non-experienced players will make what seem like perfectly reasonable plays and find that the game is over just as they're getting to grips with it - and that they've lost.

It just doesn't feel rewarding enough for me to want to become an experienced player.

I've heard a lot of people compare this game to Magic.  I have to search to find loose similarities.  Everyone starts with the same deck and has the same options to expand his deck during the game.  Something I like even more: no one is guaranteed victory because he spent all his money on cards.

A decent card game.  it's fun for a few plays but then gets boring.  The expansion (I picked up a few) get old too fast.  There are a few cards that fill up players hands and extend the game.

I wasn't too keen my first playing, but it improved the second and third.  Even when it is interactive it feels kinda solitairish, but that doesn't bother me much.

There are many different possible card mixes, some of them I fear might have optimum plays, but others might have more potential for varied combinations.  

Update:  Damn this crack.  We just keep playing and playing and my rating keeps going up.  :)  J/K.  It's actually proven to be very replayable and slight variations in the card list each game can definitely shift the balance of play.  We do a random card set every time.

Not my cup of tea. Played the base game and all players where basically trying to play as much villages and markets as possible to get more cards/actions/money, than some moats or smitheries to get even more cards. Then you spend all your money. Little player interaction unfortunately. Besides that, I did not feel immersed at all, very tacked on theme.

The first deck building game I played (and the first for most people), but I feel gameplay tends to get too repetitive as you get more plays into it. Game turn into "engine-based combo vs mono econ midrange" pretty quickly and the winner often ends up as the one who's better at keeping track of the deck's of both players. Having memory be the most important mechanic of a game leads to pretty unexciting grindfests, but game is probably significantly better when taken less seriously.

RATING: 7
Dominion is a filler game extraordinaire.  It plays very quickly, yet is fun.  The assortment of cards guarantees quite a bit of variability (a must for short games), though not as much as you'd think (you'll definitely find yourself playing favorites).  I love the deckbuilding, which takes me back to my MtG days.  However, there isn't as much depth to this as appears at first blush.  Ultimately, you're trying to build a deck that will get you $8 to spend each turn.  Action cards are important, but not as important as they seem at first.  Economy is more important, though you can not totally ignore the action cards unless you want your deck to be too slow.

So my rating is a guardedly optimistic 9.  I'm worried that I will eventually tire of the game as I've already noticed my decks tend to be about the same each time.  I've played Intrigue once, and it promises to inject some much needed new energy to this game.

Update:  I tend to avoid this one now.  I still like it, but it drags on longer than it used to.  The expansions are the biggest culprits for the slowdown.  Anyway, this game is just a bit too long to be a filler.

A simple but effective deck building game that is a lot of fun to play.

What I liked:

* Works well with varying number of players

* Different cards certain strategies work better in some games than in others.
* Game feels fresher longer

What I didn't like:
* Big money strategy is fairly effective and this strategy is virtually the same every game.
* Theme isn't worked in that well
* Can be a bit fiddly setting up particularly with expansions.
* Insert is ok for just base game but could have been a lot better.

Excellent short game that is easy to learn and play.  I still just have the base set, but I can see why there are so many expansions.  The combinations of different Kingdom cards in play each game is different each time, so you've really got to be a seasoned player to figure out the best path to Victory.  I like that it can play in 30 minutes, so you get a couple games in quite easily.

Dominion is what got us into gaming after being introduced to it by my sister. We played the living daylights out of it when we first got it as it was our only game for a time. While we've moved on to many others, this one (even just the base set) is so much fun to pull out and speed through a game or two. There's plenty of strategy, but once you're familiar with all the cards, you really play through it with a nice rhythm. It really shines as a two-player game, but also plays well with 3-4 if everyone has that rhythm down. Amazing that it's still one of my top-rated games.

Reminds me a lot of Race for the Galaxy in terms of the combo-style interaction of the cards.  All that being said...I don't like multiplayer solitaire.  I'm told this game can become more interactive with appropriate choice of the starting sets, though.

I've played many other deck-builders that came out after Dominion.  But it still ranks a 10.  It's just so slick.  In the short time it takes for opponents to play their cards, I've already figured out what to play from my hand and in what order.  I have 3 expansions (Seaside; Prosperity; Intrigue) which is all I'll ever need.  Tons of fun. My kid mastered the game at age 6.

Update: I guess that wasn't enough. Now also have Hinterlands.

Update: Empires.  Fantastic.

Bought it at the Spiel 2008 for ~23€.

[2008-11-14 Rating: n.a. -> 10]
There it is, my first 10. I always thought, it would be a "heavy" strategic game that would win the race for the perfect ten, but now it is a light-to-medium card game. Well, who cares if it's such a great and addictive one. After playing about 60 games, I just have to admit that I really love this game and I don't expect this to change in the near future. Maybe it's shine will wear of after another 150 plays, but that's not really a problem. Dominion would be the most played game in my collection then, by far.

What I really like about Dominion is that it takes some time to see how to play this game well. In the beginning you are struggling with all the action-cards only to discover later, that a coin-heavy deck is better in many situations. Then you discover how to streamline your deck and suddenly you notice that some action-cards thrown in the mix boost your deck more than you ever thought they would. And guess what, even the action-cards you initially thought were more or less worthless start to shine at some point. It is this learning-process that I deeply enjoy.

What makes Dominion even better in my book is the fact, that everyone I introduced to the game loved it and wanted to play it again and again. This observation had a great impact on my decision to rate this one a 10. Of course there are meatier games with more strategic and tactical potential, but most of them are just collecting dust on my shelf. Not this one, even my girlfriend, a non-gamer at heart, likes to play this gem from time to time.

Did I already mention that Dominion is also great with just two players? Well, it is. And so my decision is settled: Dominion gets the 10!

The game is ok, don't get me wrong I like playing it. However the game is so simple I don't like playing with more then three players. This is because I can draw my five cards and be ready to take my turn within five seconds of seeing it. Thus waiting for more players turns becomes more annoying especially when you know you are going to play one card and buy one thing taking all of a few seconds,then go back to waiting again.

After playing this more and having it catch on like gangbusters with my kids, I am revising my opinion of this game. I still have some misgivings, because this we still get dud games because of the random draw of cards. Also to say that the theme is "pasted on" is probably stating things generously. But it's quick, fun and engaging and I've had some fun games with my kids. Surest sign I'm catching the bug is that I'm eyeing expansions I want to buy.

I liked this at first but then it went stale. No real player interaction. If you buy cards to combo you either draw them together or you don't. If you buy more generic cards you just play them and buy more of the same.

New boxes didn't cause it to evolve in any real way. I see why people like it but I'll never choose to play it again.

First.  Best.  Endlessly variable, there are new combos and strategies to discover in every setup; even when the broad categories of cards make the board feel familiar, small differences can create huge changes in the way it plays out.  Theme is not weak, but abstract.  Honestly, my biggest complaint is figuring out how to store the cards.

This is my favorite boxed game of all time.  The rules are very simple, but the strategy is surprisingly subtle and deep.  I have played Dominion hundreds of time, probably more than just about any other game except Magic the Gathering (which I played professionally).  Although I still enjoy Magic, I have to admit that I think Dominion is a better design.  It is simple enough to intrigue my wife, which is saying a lot.

If there is a negative, it's that the theme is not thin... it's practically non existent.  But with mechanics this good it doesn't bother me.

This is one of the first games I bought EVERY expansion for. I enjoy the mechanic of building your deck from the selection of cards.

I really enjoyed this game when I first started playing it, but for some reason it has lost its lustre.  The last two games I played with only the base game were just not as enjoyable as they used to be.  I have not switched into the other deckbuilding camps (Nightfall, Thunderstone, Resident Evil, etc.) as I did not care much for them.  I did, however, fall in love with Quarriors! somehow, so perhaps that has something to do with my lower opinion of Dominion these days.

A brilliant, genre-defining (literally) game.  Donald Vacarino deserves more credit for his approach to game design, which is understated yet wise.  Few critics take time to appreciate the care he has put into the game and most knock-offs ignore the beauty of the original in their quest to improve upon it.

It's also infinitely replayable.  Though it can easily get tiresome if played too much in a short time, I cannot imagine burning out on the game in the long run.  I'm always up for a play of Dominion!

One of my favourite games at the moment and has been for over a year now. I have all of the expansions and it's a safe bet that further expansions will be snapped up as soon as they are available.

RATING: 4
Cute card game, but no interaction and no depth other than five different cards that give money and five different cards that draw cards.  A Throne Room / Village chain is amusing to see once though.
Update 6-4: You can play an entire game of this without even looking up.  It's like a CCG for autistics.  Doesn't have deckbuilding because you are told the ten cards you can have, and doesn't have any gameplay because you play almost all the cards on yourself.  Yay, I'm playing!

I was not expecting so simple game being so nice. Deck building was a mechanism that was kind of not-convincing to me - however once I tried it - it's very good game. Simple, quick, lots of varieties (due to number of cards/expansions). I like it very much.
After initial plays I decided to go for Eaten by Zombies and A few acres of snow - which were on my radar for a while.

RATING: 5
Played a prototype. Really enjoyed it. I think I'd rate the base game a 7.  It's fun to draw into that sweet combo that nets you a 6 point victory card.   However, with repeat plays, I'd expect my rating of the base game would drop.  Already I see that the village is an absolute requirement.  In every game I played it was the first deck to be depleted.  Others were barely touched.  Maybe due to groupthink but I doubt it.  Fortunately, there are other decks that can be swapped in and out in different combinations.  However, I don't know if the game will be released with all these cards.  If so, I expect my rating could go up.

Finally played again with Alchemy.  It's just not all that interesting to me.  There's not enough interaction...and in general, feels like a cheap Magic:TheGathering substitute.  Weeeeeak theme.

Dropping down from 7 to 6 and suspect it could drop to a 5 w/repeat playings.

Update: It didn't take many playings for it to find a home at a "5".  I've already done the MtG thing.  Dominion is like drinking a Diet drink.  Something just isn't right w/it.

Dominion is an interesting case of a game that started out strong for me, but then rapidly went downhill from there. When I first tried it I was pretty impressed. Unfortunately, as time went on I liked it less and less. I think the biggest thing that kills it for me is the down time.

With many heavier games that require a lot of thought, there is plenty to think about between turns. Either individual's actions are directly effecting you in a significant way or you need to think between turns in order to not spend an especially great amount of time ON your turn figuring out what you are going to do.

In lighter/faster games like Race For the Galaxy and Zing! things are constantly quickly moving. You are able to take your turn and immediately do something else. There is very little down time because things are constantly happening.

With Dominion, there is only rarely something going on between turns, and when something does happen it is only rarely something you can influence. Usually, what will happen is someone will play a bunch of cards and do something. Then the next turn will play their cards and do something, and it will go around the table until it is your turn to do your next move which you decided to do when you redrew a little while ago. 

Occasionally someone will play a card that influences you. This tend to has a low impact however, as it is mostly them making a decision rather than you. In addition once you have played the game a handful of times the number of difficult decisions, and thus tension, goes down quite a bit. Whereas in a game like Race I still feel like I am making tough decisions even after having played it over 200 times.

Players are medieval lords, growing their landholdings.  Large box card game.  Players take turns playing an "action" card, which grants the card's ability, possibly triggering more actions, card draws, discounts, etc.  The player may then purchase a card from the common supply, adding it to their deck.  Cards purchased may be money cards (allowing purchases), action cards (allowing more abilities) or land cards (victory points for winning).  The weird things is your entire hand is junked at the end of your turn, and you draw an entire new hand for your next turn.  So you essentially are playing lots of mini-hands.  The card burn rate means lots and lots of shuffling.  Game ends when three decks dry up.  Very light and fast game play, with basically no theme at all - essentially a big-box filler.  Fun to play - the equivalent of gaming popcorn, you just want to keep nibbling at it.  Only problems are the enormous box (why?), and I wish the cards had clearer text and costs.  Dropped a bit a couple of years later - it's got a bit bloated and there are better deck building games out there for me now (lean and mean Puzzle Strike, and the deep Thunderstone).

I personally feel dominion is over rated. Once you figure out some engine, like big money, it destroys the other person. 

I guess maybe I don't like the concept of how to win the game... by acquiring the green point cards.

Heavely enjoyed plays, quick, easy instructions Deck building game. just enough choices to not bog down quick turn taking.

In interest of full disclosure: my wife after playing was a little confused, because she thought we were going to play a game about building decks after I mentioned in was a deck building game before pulling it off the self. 

After 5 plays I still have not won a game because she begins working on victory points way before me.  I just want to crush her with taking Kingdome cards and she's just "lalala another useless vicory card for me, your turn"

tides are turning I have won the last two games my focus more on bigger money not more kingdom cards is paying off....bwaahaha

This game deserves every accolade that anyone has ever dropped on it.  When I first taught one of my roommates this game, we played it for (no joke) about 5 hours straight.  This game has a depth and variability that significantly ups its replayability.  

That being said, I've burnt out on it.  While it is true that very few deck builders that have come out since are really changing much, I will usually gravitate toward one with a bit less set up and break down time, like Ascension.

I played this addictively for a few months, and I appreciate the elegance of the base set.  As the expansions came out I began to feel overwhelmed and tired of it a bit.  I still appreciate the base game for its innovative design.  Once you get familiar with what cards are good and what strategies or combos work well together, a lot of the excitement of discovery is lost, and it feels more boring. It seems like this is the reason they have come out with so many expansion sets.  I still appreciate the design of this game, but I never feel like playing it.  I know I will never play this game as much as I did when I first played the hell out of the base set.

This is a crowd favorite. Almost infinite replay-ability, especially with the expansions. It can be frustrating when you don't draw good card combinations, but on the flip side it's exciting when your cards create awesome combos. Like a kid in a candy store, my strategy can't withstand the temptation of just picking the most expensive card I can get. There is nothing I really dislike about this game, but for some reason I'm not always in the mood for it. 

I played this game recently without the expansions. It was still fun, but I was surprised by how plain and simple it felt. I didn't realize just how much cool factor the expansions added.

Initially, having never played CCG's before, I was impressed by the depth of the game's deck-building component.  After a dozen games (mostly on BSW), the deck-building has become fairly standard, and timing the push for VP's the bigger challenge.  Still haven't played with Gardens or Witches, which certainly complicates things.

BSW is definitely the way to play this... the constant shuffling & longer play-time would otherwise lower my rating.

Good game, but i see it as semi predictable around mid game.  you can teel who's built the best deck, and there's no catching that person (them or me?)

RATING: 8
Idea:
Buy cards from 10 randomly chosen stacks + point/cash stacks to combine deck that sweeps through opposition. Base game has somewhat 40 different cards and expansions give more.

Mechanism:
Draw cards, play card(s), refine your deck or hit other players decks, choose right moment to start buying point cards (because they dont give other functions) and get most points when game ends due score cards are bought out or three stacks are bought out.

to Whom:
Good to play 2-4 players, easy to teach hard to master, to some extent repeats itself without enough cards. Requires loads of card suffling.

Special: Playable online through BSW (Not all cards included though)

The original deckbuilding game.  Players start with a very small deck of only 10 weak cards, buying more and more powerful cards to add to their decks during the course of the game.  Dominion is still the deepest and most strategic of the deckbuilders, but is also one of the easiest to learn.

RATING: 7
I love card games, so naturally like this one.  Having to strike an absolutely binary balance between win conditions and deck enhancements creates good strategic depth and "real" choice (too often in games it is easy to cheat the system by doing the things that get you both).  I think I'd like it more if there were more things you could do to hamper your opponent.

really intriguing game (no pun intended) -- it's really awesome trying a new card set and discovering all the different combos. my first game was a perfect example: we played the starter 10, and I had 1 villager/smithy/market and played them all in one turn, then realized how awesome it was to cycle through my deck like that, so i bought up all the villages and markets and smithys and had a blast drawing through my deck every turn and being able to buy multiple provinces once everything was said and done.

however, everyone needs to be on the same skill level/knowledge base for the game to be enjoyable, otherwise the better player will destroy the table. this makes it hard to teach newer players, although you can always experiment with an alternate strategy.

also, it seems almost necessary to get expansions, since your card set options will grow factorially as you get more and more different expansions.

RATING: 6
Dominion is a fairly simple engine-building game, conceptually. Your engine is your deck, which you move through at a semi-fixed rate, picking up five cards per turn and reshuffling when you run out. Certain cards move you through your deck faster, or cause your opponents to move through their deck slower. At a certain point, you switch to acquiring victory points. Whoopie.

The interesting bit is the variable setup. You pick 10 cards from an ever-increasing number, then stare at them for a bit. But that stare hides a lot.

Some setups are obvious and less interesting; get money +one or two action cards. But ~70% of the time, wheels start turning and you're faced with some options. Usually, you pick up trashing first; get rid of the crap  cards from your deck, move through it faster. But sometimes there isn't trashing, or there are attacks that you have a priority to get. Sometimes games are long and drawn out with lots of crap and lots of micro-decisions about how to manage it. Sometimes you'll completely wreck an opponent's deck, and he'll concede.

"But wouldn't you rather have a game that does that, but in a more focused way?" Sometimes. But sometimes you and your opponent disagree on the paths, and you get interesting stuff, tweaking your way through the forest. Sometimes you need to grab his power cards, or take a sharp turn into ending the game before the behemoth he's attempting to assemble takes off. And that's interesting, and that's something you don't get without variable setups. Playing a fluctuating herbalist-philosopher's stone against an ambassadoring opponent with an engine was a really interesting game.

So why do I only rate it a 6? Well, I've played mostly on isotropic (I've played >20 games in person, but >300 games online.) Without the online interface, players move slowly, and the game overstays its welcome. A dominion game that lasts 15 minutes is a lot of fun; one that lasts an hour and a half verges on torture.

There's also the problematic bit with variable setups: sometimes they're not all that interesting. And while Cosmic Encounter and the like have player interaction to steer the game in interesting directions, Dominion really doesn't have anything to fall back on.

Luck? That's an issue too, although not an extreme one. In interesting setups, skill probably makes up %60 of the outcome, and the better player wins ~80% of the time (good players get lucky, too). In less interesting setups? The good player can eke out percentagewise advantages, but that's really not that interesting.

An interesting variant I sometimes enjoy is Progminion; find an interesting set and build a robot to play it. This is a lot more interesting than it sounds.

All in all, it's a 6; I'll play it sporadically. I'd play more if it were on a good online implementation. It was an important part of getting me interested in designer games (I was pointed to it from an MTG site). It's fun. But it's not the greatest game around.

I've played the base game a fair amount now, all face to face, and I'm still really enjoying it and don't actually feel the need for the expansions.  This is helped by the fact that I've recently got my wife playing the game so exploring the base set with her as a purely 2 player game is a really nice way to approach it.

What I will note (having just played with 4 for the first time in ages) is that I think this game is by far a better 2 player game than 3 or 4.  The down time is just too high, especially late game, with more than 2 players and the game simply becomes tedious.

Fun game, but after about 50 plays the strategies seem pretty obvious.  Also, it seems that everyone starts doing the same thing every game, so despite replayability, once everyone is doing the same thing it just boils down to luck.

Certainly this is over-hyped to some degree.  The core mechanic is very much the same as To Court The King, but with coins on cards replacing the pips on dice.   But the gameplay is awfully repetitive and there is a crapload of shuffling and drawing cards.  Almost to the point of annoyance.  Playing your hand is practically automatic also.  The graphics aren't very good (compared to Race For The Galaxy or Magic) and all the coins are the same color.  Interaction level is very low, no matter what cards are in play.  Another concern is that the dominant strategy of "Buy Gold + Buy Province = WIN" seems to make all the interesting card combos irrelevant.  On the plus side, there are a lot of variations in the setup, which might give this some shelf life.   Gameplay is casual and surprisingly light, which means it has a lot of tougher competition for a game in this range.   I appreciate the addictive quality but overall this is much shallower than I expected.

Rating for base set only. The cards selected dictate whether the game will be "multi-player solitaire" or something akin to a competitive CCG. Thus there's a high replay factor assuming you and your group are willing to roll with whatever cards are chosen. If you want one or the other, you'll need to choose the cards purposefully. Still fairly fresh for me, but seems that expansions are a must to keep it from staying on the shelf.

RATING: 10
Of all my games, this one hits the table more than any other.  It’s not because its my favourite game, but it just works so well in so many circumstances.  It scales well with any number of players and is also a good two-player game.  It works well with entry gamers, non-gamers and even seasoned gamers (although you may need to add in a few expansions for them).  With about a half hour playtime, it can act as a starter game for a game day, or if played multiple times in a row, be an event all by itself.  Every game can be different or many of the recommend sets/configurations can be re-played multiple times.  
I think what makes Dominion so enjoyable is it appeals to the primal human desire to accumulate wealth, buy things and build something bigger and unique.  The mechanic is so simple but (especially when expansions are thrown in) understanding how some cards may or may not interact with each other is a study unto itself.  Every time we sit down to play a new card arrangement in Dominion we feel like we are about to engage in a science experiment to see how cards will play off each other.  Even when some random sets are created and players may struggle, its not that the set is broken, its just Dominion challenging you past your usual comfort level and making you quickly devise a new strategy and think outside the box to win the game.   
I often hear, "oh so and so is a better deck builder than Dominion because it adds this and that, etc.", but when even just a few of the many expansions are added, none have the breadth and depth that exists in the world that has been created through Dominion.  With so many expansions and countless possible combinations, Dominion has almost become a hobby within a hobby.  Such care has been taken to make sure cards can work with various other cards, no other deck builder can hold a candle to the well-balanced and streamlined play of Dominion.  In the study of deck builders, all games start with Dominion and then circle back to Dominion; it is the grand-daddy of them all.

One of the progenitors of the deckbuilding genre, Dominion is no longer the flashiest, or the fastest, or the most exciting, but it may still be the best.   I knew this game was great when I first playtested it, and it's still getting played years later.  

Dominion's design has some serious strikes against it.  As what is essentially an economic engine snowball VP grab, there can definitely be a runaway leader effect.  That is, when someone starts buying gold & provinces, they're probably not going to stop.  
The way that other players buy cards can have more of an impact than your own decisions.  This sort of multiplayer chaos is in lots of games, but pronounced here because of the limited numbers of each card available.  If you're going for a particular deck, and you have that build to yourself, it'll be powerful (maybe).  But for every player who decides to move in on that archetype, or hate-pick cards from it, your chances of winning drop dramatically.  
The attacks, depending on the current setup and the cards themselves, tend to be either too weak to hold back the leader (iow, a mere nuisance) or so potent that they become a component of one of the best strategies.  In the latter case, the person who's winning is usually using them, and making everyone else's day miserable.  The stronger (and more grief-y) the attack, the more it demands that you buy it yourself (or at least try and mitigate it), and such games can be long and painful.
Oh, and then there's another potential problem, which is the perceived dominance of 'big money'.  I don't think this is such an issue as some make it out to be,  but there's no doubting that there are some setups where you can largely ignore the idea of buying any significant number of kingdom cards.  You can't fault people for seeking out a winning strategy, but it's pretty boring to set up a display of cards, then only use the ones that are in every game.
Lastly, as a card game, there's a lot of randomness.  This means that while things will usually even out, sometimes you can make all the right choices but have them swamped by the effects of the shuffle.  2 players can go for the same build, buying the exact same cards in the same order, but one of them will get to $5 or $6 regularly, while the other will never get a hand above $4.  Without the capability to buy the cards they need, the 2nd player will quickly fall behind.  Other things that can happen are having critical cards be at the bottom of your deck after the first shuffle, so they not only show up late but miss your next deck cycle entirely, and the 5-2 split at the beginning.  Depending on the card offerings, getting a $5 and $2 opening hand can be terrible, or it can give you a huge boost.  It's no guarantee, but I'll be betting on the player who gets mine/cellar, or laboratory/chapel, or even market/moat over someone who has to go 2x silver since all the mid-value cards available stink.  I often advocate a fixed-opening variant where you skip the initial shuffle in order to patch this, but it's yet to catch on.

[i]However[/i], I have to say that Dominion isn't done in by these issues.  Most of the games that have come after it have inherited them, or even made them worse.  For a while there, I felt like the other deckbuilders, with their more freeform style, had almost replaced stodgy old dominion and its 1 action 1 buy limitations.  But as time's gone by, I've come to appreciate what those restrictions do for the game.  Dominion isn't a case of just buying the most awesome/expensive card every turn.  You have to make a careful consideration of what should really be in your deck.  Too many terminal actions is bad.  Too much time spent building up your engine before switching over to green will doom your efforts.  Buying points too early can have the same effect.  A statistician with a spreadsheet could calculate out the expectation values of money in your average hand, but you have to do this on the fly and simply have a feel for what the right ratio of money/actions is.  
Rather than an ever-changing parade of cards, Dominion asks you to look at a static 10 and figure out which decks are going to be dominant in this mini-metagame.  Despite the things I listed above, and despite the times when it feels like pulling the lever on your own personal slot machine, I think it's a good test of skill, and a solid design.

Not enough interaction. Not engaging on other players' turns. Separates your plans from their payoff by too much time and randomness. A random combination of rules does not an interesting game make.

Rather unremarkable game. No theme and the cards are boring but it plays smooth. Plays best at 4.

RATING: 6
Quick - only 30 minutes and because different cards can be used each game, variable. 

Different strategies can be used. Can be somewhat repetitive at times as the cards are somewhat similar (extra actions, extra cards or something else). Also can sometimes drag at the end since many players end up with decks that allow them to cycle through the entire thing in one sitting. Boring to watch when they have 30 cards. 2 extra actions. 3 extra cards. 2 extra actions, 3 extra cards, etc.

For that reason, I'm giving it a 6, for the high burnout factor - too many plays and I don't want to touch it again for weeks...

Idea muy original, pero el juego me parece un poco soso, con mas cartas de ataque el juego gana mas, pero aun asi creo que el gran pecado del juego es que llegado un momento se puede jugar en piloto automatico.

A good entry in to the modern board game era. Was one of the first games I played to get entered into it. A very very basic deck building game. After you play other more advanced deck builders this one loses its luster. I will still give it 7 because as I said it is an amazing gateway game.

Very good.

Some disclaimers:

2. Because of downtime and for reducing randomness it's now only two (or very experienced) players game for me.

At the moment I haven't exhausted the base set yet to justify the expansions. But the possibilities the base set gives you is enough to keep you busy for many games. Looking forward to trying some expansions.

Play count is for all Dominion plus expansions.  Always mix them all up, or at least mix up several of the expansions.  Game plays equally will with 2, 3 or 4.  5 and 6 players can slow the game down ... especially with AP players.

Definitely one of my favorites. Just the base set of Dominion offers so much fun and replayability, especially when you insert interactive kingdom cards (like thief, spy, witch or bureaucrat). 
It goes even further on the fun scale when you add the expansions.
There is a special kind of zen when I open a new box and start sleaving the cards with protectors.

Dominion is that weird, wonderful grandpappy of deckbuilders and nothing can ever take that away from the game.  However, most of the popular complaints about the game are valid - multiplayer solitaire at its finest.  It's good fun, especially if you've never played a deckbuilder before, but the mechanic has been improved upon multiple times and you'll find that the more you play Dominion, the older it gets - if that makes any sense.

While I have put countless amount of hours into this game, I have moved on, but it will always hold a special place for being the deckbuilder that started all deckbuilders.

REVISED REVIEW:

I admit, at first, I hated this game a lot, if you want to know why, you can see my OLD REVIEW below.  However, after playing about 50 games, using a mix of cards from the original, and the expansions Intrigue, Seaside, and Prosperity, I have found a great appreciation for the Dominion SERIES, however, the original is still lacking in strategy and player interaction, when compared to the expansions.  I think one of the reasons I was so hard on the game was it was my first deck-building game, and although it seemed like a great mechanic, the game didn't see fun to me.  I laid out 3 reasons this game was bad (see below), but I will now admit that there is really only one flaw in this game, and thats with player interaction.  There is more strategy to Dominion than I originally thought, but it takes playing with other players that are knowledgable about the game to see it.  Now that I have played several decked building games over the years like Thunderstone, Ascension, and Legendary, and the shuffling doesn't bother me at all anymore.

I have revised the overall score to 3 stars, but I give Intrigue and Prosperity 5 stars, that is a great combination, making a very strategic and interactive game.  I hope this helps anyone buying this game, if given the choice, I would buy Intrigue over the orginal as a stand alone game, and then consider expanding it once you have the hang of it.  Although, there are a few cards in the orinigal that are really good cards, but I'm not sure if buying the whole game just for a few cards is worth it, considering you have the choice (when I bought Dominion, there were no expansions yet, for the record).  

OLD BLISTERING REVIEW (revised due to many of the comments below, playing the games more, and the expansions)

I feel like I'm the only gamer that hates this game on general principle.  When I first bought this game I really wanted to like it; in fact I HAD to like it because EVERYONE likes it.  I don't like ANY aspect of this game, but instead of going through them all, I will stick to the 3 things that KILL this game.  ONE: its 4 player solitaire.  There is so little interaction between players its boring.  I have heard that some of the expansions fix this problem, but I hated this game and I'm not spending $50 more dollars on the off chance I might like it.  TWO: It looks like a strategy game, but there's really only one strategy, BUY GOLD.  Nothing beats this strategy, and even thought you are given a plethora of action cards, most of them just add useless cards to your deck, whereas more money always puts you in the best place for every situation.  Of course, some would say, doesn't that just mimic real life, if you have more money, you can do more.  Of course it does, but who ever thought a game was good because it mimics real life?  Quite in the opposite in my opinion.  THREE:  Shuffling, MY GOD the shuffling.  I really don't mind shuffling cards, but after the 300th time, I get sick of it.  Yes, you could go out and buy an automatic card shuffler, but, and I'll ask it again, WHY OH WHY, would I want to spend MORE MONEY on this train wreck.  Any game that makes you spend more, or buy expansions, just to make the game good isn't a good game.

After 1 game. It does not get to me. Simple luck based card game pretending to be somewhat deeper. Verified to 6 after the second play. However I wonder if it will get boring after more plays.

Played 3 times in one evening. Simply loved it. Tried at least every card once. Gonna to buy it. Can't wait to play Dominion again. It's fun and it plays fast. Very simple game, not that many rules.

Got my own copy. Simply an excellent game. One of my favorites among the newer games which game out lately. Can easily play 2-3 games in one evening.

Highly addictive.

Update:

Played again in a long time. Still had fun playing the game. Thought that I was pretty much done with this game. Playing it again makes me want to get another expansion.

*Update 2*

Got a deal with a friend. I got every expansion of Dominion. So, I now got the basic set a 3 expansions twice. Going to trade what I have as double.

Or maybe bring Dominion to my brother's place and play with them to see if they enjoy it. Might give basic game as a gift.

RATING: 4
Fair.  Fast play, short games.  Having the right card mix is pretty essential, but on the other hand randomly selecting them is fun too.  I think my interest in this has been sustained by not playing online, and only rarely playing with my group.  It feels really easy to burn out on, but with restraint it should stay fresh.  There's no real theme to the game, and at the end there's nothing to really talk about -- no narrative, story, or anything.  It feels a little overdeveloped, like all the rough (and interesting) edges were streamlined out of existence.

Looks to be a huge money pit with all the expansions on the horizon.  I'm not really feeling the need to be a completist these days so I'll probably wait and see.

May not have been the first deck-building game, but it's the first one people remember and it's arguably the best.  Playtime and setup time are manageable.  Some action card combos are killer good and experienced players will undoubtedly use them to beat up on newbies.  Plus it's been my experience in tournaments that the 1st player has a huge advantage given that he could have an extra turn and usually gets to do attacks 1st.  Chapel is the only broken card in the base set.

RATING: 7
Fun for the first 10 plays, which is saying something, but ultimately, I don't think it has much depth to it. A lot of the game really comes down to getting a few lucky draws that allow you to purchase 6VP cards. The initial set-up of action cards is important, and, as with all card games, managing probabilities plays an important role. The problem for me is that a couple of less likely outcomes or card combinations tend to imbalance the game.

Me ha gustado mucho de a dos, pero se torna medio automatizado con el correr de las partidas. Creo que es un juego para no abusar mucho de él.

Cada vez lo disfruto más. Y eso que le dí manija. Casi todas las partidas a dos. Pero también lo he probado a 3 y cuatro personas. A tres me gustó. A 4 perdí un poco de vista qué ocurría con el resto de los jugadores y lo disfruté significativamente menos.

I only have the base game.  My boyfriend and I love it. We play this all the time and as our skill develops together we have to constantly change tactics.  The 25 decks give the game a great variety.  As other players have discussed at length, the Chapel card is so powerful that when it is available the game changes dramatically.  Usually we ban Chapel when playing just to make the game harder.  We can't wait to try all of the different expansions.

Easy to teach and even easier to grasp, this one gets high marks for  card text that is brief and efficient and game play that's different every time. Clear rules and a functional box insert are a bonus. Enjoy exploring the different combos and combating different strategies. Doesn't hurt that the better half can't get enough of it and the youngest can't stop talking about it. Only negatives are the black bordered cards that are already showing wear. And watching others shuffle their cards does little for the blood pressure. (Card sleeves can't come fast enough.) And the money cards really should have been different colors -- would have saved a lot of queries from across the table. The expansions add wonderful variations and each plays differently.

Was amazing at first but the charm wore off quite quickly. In some sense this encapsulated everything I am ambivalent about in contemporary game design: limited interactivity, inconsistent production values (card art especially), long down time between turns, often a lack of competitive strategies to pursue, etc. But the scalability is quite impressive, particularly in how the game holds up with various amounts of players.

Dominion is undoubtedly a very good game and it never ceases to amaze me how differently the game plays with variations in card setup.

My Dominion set consists of a mix of the base game, Intrigue, Alchemy, and Prosperity. It's a lot of fun to try different combinations of cards each game. Depending on the complexity of the available cards, each game can range in difficulty from quick and easy for beginners or tense and challenging for expert play. Player interaction is not usually very high, but simply discussing the card combinations is enough to keep things fun. This is my most played game but my rating has dropped over time as I've lost interest.

The first deck builder and probably still the best pure deck builder around. The theme is thin, but that can be good as some themes may turn people away (e.g. fantasy theme in Thunderstone Advance).

At this point, I wouldn't rate deck building high on my list of mechanics, it's fine, but would rather see it as part of a game than the entire game (e.g. Rococo, Lewis & Clark, etc.). Still, Dominion is fun and quick.

UPDATE: So many deck builders are so much better than the first one now. Sold.

UPDATE: Dominion is wearing thin on me -- I think the deckbuilding mechanic is great, but it just ends up feeling like a one-trick pony in terms of the actual gameplay. Also, the graphic design of the cards varies widely but unlike Magic: the Gathering or Blue Moon, the general quality of the artwork is pretty mediocre. It also seems like the franchise is moving into Carcasonne-like levels of expansionitis. I need to leave this one alone for a while.

-----------
First impressions are very positive: easy to teach, lots of variety. I like the "CCG-like" aspect of it combined with the ease of getting into the whole thing, especially with new players.

I have a few minor annoyances with card design, but what are you going to do?

Rio Grande have been doing very well with their strategy card games lately.  The rules are so easy that I literally explained all of the rules to a friend in less than 5 mins.  I don't see it being difficult for anyone to understand how to play this.  Being played well is another matter because deck construction is definitely a refined talent involving consistency, synergy and creativity.  Dominion is the grandfather of all deck building games and yet it's still probably the most popular.  That's certainly a testament to the games quality.  Unfortunately in the base game, there is not a lot of variety in the cards and not a lot of decisions in the order in which to play your hand.

Digital Alert:

The biggest downside for me is that there is a lot of shuffling during the game as well organization of the stacks of cards before and after the game.  This makes the physical copy about a 4 rating for me.  If I was rating this just based solely on BSW online play, I would probably rate this a 6.  I would be even more keen to be able to play it on iOS if it has both AI and online options.  I hear it's in the works and will update this entry if it does come to pass and I try it.

Awesome game. Appeals to a lot of different gamer types. However, I feel that Intrigue is needed to complete the game. The other expansions, which I don't own, but have played fairly extensively, water down the game too much.

Először 8-ast adtam a játéknak, s talán még most is arra tartom érdemesnek, de a második játék után látom a játék korlátait, s hogy a kezdeti izgalom hamar abba fog maradni.
Az első pár kör még érdekes, amíg beindul a szekér, de utána átmegy egyfajta automatizmussá, kicsit gyerekkorom pirosozása jutott eszembe, ha valaki tudja miről beszélek. Igazából nem nagyon figyelve a másikra, a felhúzott lapok alapján már automatikusan teszem a dolgomat, és várom, mikor jönnek a várva várt értékek.
Maradok a San Juannál, ahol sokkal nagyobb a játékosok közötti interakció, ahol végig feszített az izgalom, s nem csap át holmi passziánszá.

RATING: 5.5
After initial enthusiasm now, after many rounds of Dominion, I must admit that - depending on the deck you build - it's mostly an exercise in capitalism and a solitaire game packaged as multiplayer. Collect a lot of money quick, win.

Edit: Haha, I just read Innsmouth_Look's comment just below mine which has probably been posted while I was typing this, and it's essentially the same. Cheers!

Best deck building game out there. This, with a few expansions is a great game. By itself, it can get old after several plays. I love playing with Seaside, Intrigue and HInterlands, add all the ranomizer cards together, shuffling up and dealing the top ten until you have played every single action card!

Gifted to me!!!!!!!!! Yay me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
12-11-10:  1st game 3 players...until my daughter fell asleep at the table.  She was buying tons of silver and gold.  All of sudden, a 2-player game.  Mystery Bob starting doing tons of multi-action and multi-card draw combos and getting more and more cards, and more and more money.  I started getting more money and slowly buying duchys and provinces.  After several multi-action card and multi-buys turns by Mystery Bob, I quietly bought more VPs and quietly ended the game.  He was...surprised!!!!!

2nd play - Village Square set up.  I won by 2 points.  Played 3-player and my daughter finally started seeing how to utilize her action cards to maximize her buying power.  Pretty fun!!

3rd play - Big Money set up.  Mystery Bob finally won...by 1 point!  Played 2-player; I ended by buying the last Province Card, but I had trashed 2 of my Estate cards early in the game via the Chapel.

Once you get past the novelty of the card combos, there is nothing left.  I can win easily as my husband becomes distracted by making longer and longer card combos.  I focus on points and usually squeeze a win right by him.  Only game I lost was because I trashed an Estate card--if I hadn't I would have won. 

Have not played in a long time.  TRADED!!

RATING: 7
We borrowed this and played it a lot more than either of us expected. It seems a good quick game (not always too quick) and adds a variety of randomness and unknowness to the game. We've spent most of the time playing 2 player games, which work well, but the multiplayer games are just as good.

Ended up buying Intrigue as we were used to all the cards here (in just 2 weeks!) and I felt the Duchy and Estate cards aren't used much (they are more involved with Barons and Dukes in Intrigue)

I like this game, but I don't *love* this game, at least not yet. I'm going to reintroduce it to my game night group, and I'll have to run more than one game at a time since it only supports 4 players. I recently got 2 expansions as a gift, and I'm going to keep trying new combinations of cards. Hopefully I'll get the "Aha" moment and realize why people love this game. If not, that's ok too.

SOLD IT!

The great granddaddy of the deck building genre. Addicting for first time players, despite the mountains of cards needed and IMO ugly artwork. The game is solid and would never begrudge anyone from owning it, but with it and others like it accessible on mobile devices, it just felt tiresome to play the physical version anymore, since you just want the rush of building the deck and in-the-flesh players only get in the way of that.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Innovative idea and fine mechanism for sure. But I don't like to shuffle my cards over and over again. I didn't feel much interaction between players and the game itself felt more like dealing with a mechanic. The theme is artificial and pointless.
Also waiting for the other player(s) doing all their combos ("And now I have 3 actions and draw 2 new cards, and now I ...") is sometimes a tourture.

After finding the software version, I am usually keen to play it!

Wow, I really pre-judged this one harshly.  It just didn't "look" great and I was worried about the typical hype bubble.  Then I tried it.  What a great game!  Not unlike Race for the Galaxy, it's a CCG, but without the first C, and I really like that.

I've played litterally hundreds of games of Dominion.  Mostly online.  I also got to do some beta testing for the game.  Even after all this time, it is still interesting and lively.  

What makes this game so great is the speed of play, simplicity of rules and the depth it maintains.  Everyone who plays seems to like this game.

I must admit the game is getting a little stale, but i stil llook forward to playing it after 200 games, it's got to be one of the best games I've ever played.

My feelings on Dominion ebb-and-flow much more than with other titles. I love the puzzle of 'solving the market'. Which cards interact best with the other cards? Which cards will my opponents target, and how can I counter them? Is this game going to play quickly or slowly, and how can I tailor my strategy around that? This puzzle solving keeps me in love with Dominion. However, once the game actually starts, it feel like it drags on. I run through the motions and hope the Provinces dry up quickly, so I can try to solve the market again. But the constant expansions keep drawing me back in, and my first games playing Seaside were some of my favorite ever.

A good, fast game that's certainly unique, as you build your deck during the game.  I can see the base set running dry very quickly, although that's mainly because anyone who gets their hands on this game will likely play it many many times in a short time period.  Expansions will address this, though.  Very accessible.

--High variability with which cards are chosen to play, and even which expansions are included


Cons
--Dry dry dry dry.  Point collection for the sake of point collection.
--Offers no game arc.  You buy cards to buy better cards that allow you to trigger the end of the game.

RATING: 10
Limiting actions and buys per turn adds a lot of strategic depth and makes the game generally more punishing than other deckbuilders I have played. Looks like there is more of a barrier for newer players and more to be explored and replayed due to this limitation in play. Keeping the same cards available all game reduces chance of a plan being ruined by the wrong cards coming out. While the deckbuilding mechanic itself has been done to death, these differences make Dominion very distinct from games like Legendary, Ascension, and Star Realms

The original deck-builder.  What a game.  We have played this game w/ [Thing=40834][/Thing] and [Thing=66690][/Thing] many, many times over the years.  It doesn't see the table much anymore, but it's earned a lifetime achievement award from my family and will retain it's 8.5 rating indefinitely.

RATING: 9
Definitely one of the better of the deck building type games. What I like about this game is that there is still a sense of interaction between players that you don't see in some of the other deck building games. I also like that it works well for two players.  Some people seem to think that there is one winning strategy but I would argue that with the variety of cards for this game, the "one winning strategy" is probably far more limited.

Fast and fun. A great addition to all these next gen card games we're seeing. 

10 to 8: 113 plays. I've played this a little too much, but I did have a good run. Also, I feel the luck of the draw is a little understated in Dominion. 

8 to 5: 121 plays. Winning in Dominion is a very pragmatic affair. Forget about all the fun cards, just get 8 gold, buy your 6vp, cycle - maybe faster with the chancellor, remove lesser cards with the chapel - the strategies are very tiring to me.

RATING: 7
Don't really see the appeal to this game. After playing twice, the game just really bored me. Although I only played it with just my wife, perhaps it's more fun with more people. I've read it gets better with expansions, but as of now, I don't plan on purchasing any. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
At first glance the game feels very redundant, abstract, mathematical, repetitive and automated to me. A theme is almost non-existent, and the ending comes rather abrupt and is kind of unspectacular. But nonetheless it is kind of fascinating to see your deck getting optimized on the fly and try to make it into a well oiled engine.

RATING: 6
Enjoyable, but a little dull.

I like the basic deck-building idea (although I still prefer something like Magic where you can do the deckbuilding on your own time), and pulling off combos is fun.  The basic set of cards, which is what I have mostly played with, is well balanced, and gives a surprising number of different possibilities.  

The downfall of the game, however, is that there is virtually no interaction.  You are just racing to see who can build the best deck fastest; you are not playing against the opponent, but instead both of you are playing against the game.  The upshot of this is that the game gets old quickly.  It was fun at first, but as soon as I had figured out the combos, there wasn't anything left.  

So, in summary: pleasant and at first interesting, but not very interactive and so lacking in replay value.

The replayability and balance of this game is amazing.  The learning curve is nice.  The short play time and simplicity, combined with straighforward tactics and a nice application of chance makes this a game everyone I have ever shown it to wants to play.
You don't need any expansions for hundreds of hours of fresh play.

I really enjoy Dominion.  It has the deck building that reminds me of MtG, and the play is fairly quick; allowing for multiple games fairly painlessly.  I can see this as becoming one of my top 10 games.  To make set up / take down easier, I have converted all the cards into a trading card box, with index cards separating and naming each card.  (using colored cards for each set, but ABC order for all.)  Makes carrying and storing the game a breeze.  Many others in my group have now abandoned the provided box from Rio for the CCG generic box.

A quick-playing and very clever game. Reminds me of Race for the Galaxy, though the theme felt stronger in RftG. It's interesting to try different types of card combinations for each game but replayability tends to dry up. The base game tends to devolve into boring combo plays. (Yea Village, I'm looking at you.) Intrigue helped jazzed things up a bit.

Fun, Light, Deck Building Game. Good interplay interaction. Quick - under one hour.

Easy to teach youth. Strategy and tactics can be surprisingly deep depending on the 8 cards that come out at the beginning of the game.

For some reason though, it just didn't grab me. I think the player interaction, while present, was rather shallow in terms of strategic options, and that pushed me away.

The base set, while still a decent game, is not nearly as interesting as Intrigue or some of the other expansions. The card interactions are very basic. That being said, Dominion is all about the expansions imo - and uncovering new complex combinations - so the base set certainly has its place.

The cornerstone of deck-building games. If you don't have it, buy it. Then buy a couple of expansions. Enjoy.

Take note though: the base game by itself is really only worth an 8. You need expansions for it to deserve a 10, so I'm actually rating the family here, not the game. Now that you know where the 10 comes from, read the first paragraph again.

"You are a monarch, like your parents before you, a ruler of a small pleasant kingdom of rivers and evergreens. Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes and dreams! You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion! In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner.

But wait! It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the coffers of your treasury. Your parents wouldn't be proud, but your grandparents, on your mother's side, would be delighted."

It's not as deep or interactive as Race for the Galaxy, but Dominion is low-pressure, relatively quick, and tolerable. I'm concerned about long-term playability, however: the variant deck set-ups do change things up a little, but don't radically alter the game. Too much of the game leans towards it being played on auto-pilot.

[b][thread=507774]The PLAYMOBIL® Legion reviews "Dominion"[/thread][/b]

(As of [b]127[/b] plays) The genre-defining deck-building game. I find that winning efficiently is not necessarily as satisfying as discovering new and unlikely card combinations. Not the Greatest Game Ever, but easily my Most Played Game Ever and, contrary to my early predictions, I am still not tired of it. Replayability is vastly improved by the expansions, especially [GAMEID=40834], which manages to revitalize the gameplay without introducing too many new mechanics.

[b]Why this is in my Top Ten:[/b] Dominion is all about the joy of discovery - discovering what cards work well together, discovering new strategies, etc. Every time I have played Dominion, I have experienced the joy of discovery. Occasionally the discovery in question is "Wow, that was a [i]terrible[/i] idea"... but I still get joy from it. Plus, the relatively simple gameplay makes it possible to introduce this joy to new gamers. 

[b]2 year verdict:[/b] I don't see any sign of my interest in this game diminishing.

In my opinion, the endless shuffling is part of the appeal.  This, like knitting, is an activity for slightly hyperactive people who need to be doing something with their hands all the time.  I like to sit quiet and nearly motionless, save for scratching my beard in deep thought, so this game is not for me.

The game seems to work well enough, but once you've worked out the strategies for each set of cards, it becomes a matter of luck between experienced players.  A new set offers interesting new strategic inquiry, but I don't get the sense it takes that long to work out the best options, so buying new decks will be required to give the game longevity.

I always take the cards that nobody else takes, because I feel sorry for them.  My anthropomorphizing tendencies make me finish last again.

RATING: 8
This is just a temporary rating, since I haven't gotten to play with all of the cards yet. Dominion has been immensely enjoyable so far, but I wish there were more opportunities to screw your opponents. If we don't play with the Witch or the Thief (or, to a lesser extent, the Spy or the Bureaucrat), the only interference will be racing to grab the Chapel/Laboratory/Market cards first. 

Still, so far it's been scratching my CCG itch. Some combos are glaringly obvious, but there have been a few fun ones to discover. And as a longtime CCG player, I feel right at home tweaking my strategy between games to find the best optimization for my deck.

That above statement is my only potential caviat: Dominion, at its core, is an efficiency game. Find the optimal turn-based buys for whatever mix of cards you're using, rinse and repeat. And if there were only the ten basic kingdom cards included, Dominion would be a puzzle to solve instead of a game to play. However, there's a lot of customizing and variety included here, so I'm not worried about it losing its spark anytime soon.

A CCG-style game and a less confrontational version of MtG where you build your deck on the fly.

- pros: scales well, interesting decisions, synergistic combos/cards, quick play-time, good replayability, unique mechanics and gameplay
- cons: luck element, lots of shuffling, weak theme, minimal player interaction.

The unique mechanics, interesting decisions, potential for synergy and interesting gameplay, combined with quick gameplay and remarkable replayability/variety really makes the game.

[url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/354034]The starting player has an advantage[/url] if he triggers the game end, [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/2974072#2974072]even the designer admits this[/url].  Solution: Perhaps the other players should received the opportunity to finish the round? Or get one more turn?  See [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/356437]my proposed variant[/url]: [i]When the end game is triggered, players complete the round.  No additional Victory cards are made available for purchase, aside from the ones already remaining available.[/i]. For more discussion, see the thread about the [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/368753]equal number of turns[/url] variant.  This is probably the best solution (although people earlier in turn order are slightly disadvantaged by this variant because maybe they would have bought victory points had they known the game would end; but people late in turn have disadvantage that Province cards are all used up).  Either way there seems to be a slight advantage, either to starting players (with official rules), or later players (with 'finish the round' variant) - which is lesser of the two evils?  Probably the "equal turns" variant is best.  Note that the number of Provinces is always divisible by the number of players.

Good resources on why the [thread=784021]Big Money[/thread] strategy isn't auto winning.

Which expansion next?  See: [geeklist=141264][/geeklist]  Seaside, Prosperity, and Dark Ages (35 new cards) are best.

This one is a classic, and the amount of cards available make the game incredibly versatile and continues to stay fresh after many years.

Best deck-builder I've played.  It's true that the game is pretty much over before you start playing, but because you buy to your discard pile you can't be sure of how things will come out.  If you don't like shuffling cards, avoid.

At first I was very impressed with the design of Dominion and played several games in a row. I still think it's clever though not for me. It is what it is, and for some people it's gaming crack while for others it's much ado about nothing. You're basically playing against yourself to see if you can make longer and longer card chains based on a different starting point each turn. 

I get that that is absolutely fascinating to some people. It's too akin to chewing gum for me; even in my card games I need something more substantial than that. The cycle of expansions is necessary because you get bored with solving the same puzzle over and over, so I don't see how they can ever stop cranking them out. 

I've subsequently come to appreciate deckbuilding when it's part of a larger construct, but let's thank Dominion for getting us there.

I should like Dominion since I usually prefer playing card-based games, but the game is far from being my favourites. You mostly have the feeling that everyone is building a deck of his/her own (and that you're playing alone), and most of my playing time passes while I wait more skillful players to end their turns.

I discovered deck builder mechanic from Trains, the descendant of Dominion. My favorite part of Trains is the card play and deck building so it was natural give a try for Dominion. So far I haven't yet bothered playing Trains again. The deck building and card combos in Dominion are pure brilliance.

I have to admit that I just could not hold myself and immediately bought a pile of expansions although I could easily continue playing on with base set only. The learning curve that I have witnessed for base set is brilliant. First you just start messing around and trying different ideas with cards. Slowly you start discovering synergy between the cards until you reach the point where you are able to properly formulate (at least seemingly) sensible strategy for the whole game. After that you will improve in the evaluation of efficiency and quality of strategies. I hope that the same process is started all over again for the each expansion.

The rating for this is the overall rating for Dominion and its expansions. The reason why it deserves rating this high is the combination of the brilliant game system and excellent content (cards) for the system.

The gateway deckbuilder.  I prefer Dominion to other deckbuilders I have tried.  One critique I would make is that the art is ass.  It's terrible.  Not only is it terrible, it's inconsistent too.  Between sets, styles change, and even within the set it's got some gaudy/awful/awkward/inconsistent cards.

Another minor complaint: the base game does not feel complete by itself.  Do yourself a favor and buy an expansion too (just not Alchemy).  I recommend Prosperity.

An excellent and very clever game. Deck building is a new mechanic for me for a board game and most enjoyable it was too. I can see this one getting lots of plays. I am not a huge fan of the box art or the design of the logo and card backs though, which is a shame as I am a sucker for those types of things. 

So i thought i would come back some three years later and write a few more of my thoughts.. Dominion is amazing. A true trend setter in the world of board games. The game is constantly enjoyable and is a perfect length for people to say 'just one more game'.

One of the best games ever.

This game reminds my wife too much of Magic the Gathering, so she hates it and so I don't own it.  Limited plays have been against people who have had much more experience with the game and the learning curve (although not large) really hurt my experience.  This is true for any of the expansions as well.  I would probably rank this higher if I had someone to play with on a more regular basis because I loved Magic the Gathering and deckbuilding.

Everyone and their dog loves this game. And I can see why. It's a smart card game presented in a much too large box. There are a pile of cards that can be traded in and out between games to ensure "endless" variety. A strong game... but I wonder if the hype I'm reading here at BGG is legitimate. I mean, it's not like this game summons a fairy princess to make you a ham sandwich - it's just a card game.

I personally think Dominion is a little overrated. I mean, ultimately you are just drawing and playing cards over and over. But it is SO well-loved and offers so much variety of strategies due to the large mix of different cards you can choose from that even if overrated, it is still a great game with a wide range of options! It is also a terrific introduction to deck-builders.

I'm not so hooked as some others, but it is a really great game with enormous amount of expansion opportunities, which makes you never get tired of it.

The more I play basic Dominion the less I like it. Certain card combos can ruin games, but played with the right set of cards selected for deck-building, this becomes a 9/10 game.

I really enjoy Dominion, and definitely like the vast replayability due to the mix-and-match nature of the cards.  Yet, somehow it rarely gets played these days, always picking something else before it.  I do have a fun time every single time I play, though.

I don't mind games with low player interaction, especially when I'm in the right mood for them, and Dominion is one of those games where you can really analyze your strategies after the game and see where you went wrong.  That can be pretty neat.

This is a great addictive game that can be learned in 2 minutes.  After several games though it becomes apparent that there are only a few strategies that really work well.  Despite this there is a ton of replayability.  As far as expansions go, I prefer Seaside over Intrigue.  There cards were far more interesting.  Intrigue gave so many choices that the game would slow down because everyone's thinking.

Dominion was ground-breaking in its day and so deserves its place in history... however I feel its day has passed!

Gameplay is dry and unimaginative. There are much better alternatives out there.

The increasing cardpool only serves to provide more ways in which you play with yourself, in less than subtle ways.

How quickly can you build an engine and then break it?

This was really a break out game developing on the advances for Puerto Rico and then RFTG, evolving into a full card playing game, at least one where you don't have to buy a deck.  The 25 different cards make for a wide variety of games in one deck. 

After you've played it 200 times you may tire of setting it up.  But it's a classic well worth owning & playing.

RATING: 9
Definitely one of my favorites.  Dominion is still the ultimate example of a deckbuilding game in my book.  It is elegant and strategic.  This can lead to a lopsided game when playing against one or more newbies, but in games like that I always like to try new strategies or buy different cards I've never played with before.  Tons of expansions make this game very replayable.

RATING: 8
Teeny tiny font, and only negative inter-action, but otherwise a good fun game for deck builders. The basic game is expensive for a lot of cards and nothing else, but it's a good game. I already want the expansion. *** Played agian today, FOUR TIMES in a row, unheard of in my experience. I was asking Mike to stay and play another game. Now we know what we are doing, each game took just 30-40 minutes, making this a candidate for lunch-break gaming. I'm staying on my 8 rating, but I can see it going up.

Played this several times with my girlfriend, fun game but she always wins hence the 7,5 score and not the 8 ;). This was actually the first game in my personal collection and started my Boardgame addiction. The drafting mechanic is fun, the point scoring is a bit blunt as well as the art on the cards. But still this is a something every boardgamer should consider of having in their collection. Great gateway game!

I hated this game before. I don't anymore.

* The limit on actions and buys SUCK
* There are now much more interesting deckbuilders out there

Don't get me wrong, I used to love this game, and I would play the crap out of it. But, that was when I was all about winning games, and not about playing them. I constantly lost, and I feel like the fact that there is a decent amount of skill in this deck builder means I felt I should be able to win more. Suffice to say, I am sick of the game. Eventually, the games feel like competitive solitaire, and they get similar. I appreciate the game for being the first of its kind, and helping me get into gaming, but I have moved on to games that don't make me so focused on winning, and not about the experience. The game is the focus when you play dominion, not the people playing. That's what I think is missing for me

I spent a lot of time playing on BSW, and for a while had become heavily addicted (thanks Thommy8!).  But it's one of those games that's perfect for BSW.  You don't have to deal with shuffling the cards or setting it up.  Fast plays.  Many games in a row.  But like everything else on BSW (except Tichu), it didn't last for me as I started to become tired of it.  Clearly a CCG in disguise - there is no end in sight to possible expansions.  I would never buy this.  If I have the urge again, I will go back to playing on BSW.

This is one of those games that is very simple to teach and to play yet has a very high strategic upside and lots of replayability due to the variance in kingdom card setups.  Perhaps the mechanics are a hair too simple for this to be a 10.

An extremely addictive card game with endless variety, especially with all of the expansions.  A game that my non-gamer wife really likes to play.  My nine year old son is a shark at this game.

After reading everything I could find about the game, I finally decided I needed to learn BSW and try it out.

Pure joy ensued! Neeeeed to own this :)

Update: I own it now. It's still great.

Update: After several more plays, this game is still fun, but would definitely require expansions to keep up the interest. However I'd rather try something new than buy expansions for this. This I take as a sign that rating should be lowered.

Played 50+ times with 2-4 players, including 1p and 2p games on Goko etc.

2011: When I first tried this out (in 2008 when it first came out), it felt too mathy and mechanical and I decried the lack of theme. I gave it a 6. Then I traded for a copy a year ago just to get rid of a game I didn't want, knowing that Dominion was a fairly sought after game. I didn't play it the first year I owned it. Then I lugged it out one day when most of the rest of my games were packed up, and suddenly I saw the variation in tactics the game offered. "Hm. Well at least that part is fun." I gave it a 7. It intrigued me, so I taught it to a different friend and her and I both had a blast. I gave it an 8. I traded for the Intrigue expansion so I wouldn't burn out on the base game early. Intrigue was awesome, and it made me realize how "boring" the base game is. A week later I forgot to bring down Intrigue so it was back to base set only. And it was awesome. I gave it a 9. Today I taught my friend's boyfriend to play, having also taught it to another friend last night, and realized that even the base game is something that (right now) I can't get enough of. I give it a 10.

AUG/13: As a GAME SYSTEM, Dominion rates as a 10 for me, no question. The base game though is not as interesting to me as some of the subsequent expansions, and using BGG's rating system, I have to give the base game an 8. The expansions range from 8 to 10 for me. Dark Ages is the one I enjoy the most. Then Seaside. Then Hinterlands.

SEP/13: Taught this to a new friend, then taught it to my brother and his girlfriend, both instantly wanted to buy copies. This game is just that good. You can complain about the solitaire nature of the game, but people seem to enjoy the puzzle aspect of the game in a social setting.

Fast, easy, strategy in card management.  Thousands of possible card combinations, so very replayable.  Can't wait for expansions on this one.

Since I have alphabitized the cards in the box, in order to truely choose cards randomly, printed the names on paper and draw 10 face down.  Then people complain about the combinations or lack of combinations--I say, play it how we draw it.  It demands creativity and leads to new discoveries in play.  To play a game without extra buys or actions can be very difficult, and adds new dimension to the game.

I think I am going to fall over and feint...My husband, with whom I have logged over 7,000 plays of Lost Cities, but besides that will play only 10 Days in Asia, and Crokinole, announced he will replace Lost Cities with DOMINION!  How did this miracle happen?  Our daughter was visiting and wanted to play and her father did not want to be left out!  He slogged through 3 games whining, cursing, and complaining...so knock me over and revive 3 days later when he announced he liked it.

12/8/09  Since I'm on the very cutting edge of board games, I think I'm finally going to try Dominion tomorrow.

12/9/09  Played first 3 games of Dominion, all 2-player. Liked it alot, but wish we had more players. It just became a race for a couple key cards.

12/10/09  Been thinking about Dominion quite a bit (sign of a good game). I want more theme and less focus on one card or two. Maybe Thunderstone?

1/27/10  I played Thunderstone last night. I think I liked it more than Dominion in almost every way.

4/13/10  Played Dominionx2. I'm kind of indifferent to it still and I think it's kind of souring me on Thunderstone, too. Genre might not be for me.

9/21/10  Ascension was fun. I liked it better than Thunderstone and much better than Dominion. Maybe this whole deck-building thing will have legs.

10/12/10  Game night started with Dominion. I liked it more than normal. Alchemy cards, better randomized cards, or the fact that I won?

11/2/10  Played Dominion (with Seaside for the first time). I'm probably disliking Dominion less, thankfully since it's kind of unavoidable.

6/21/11  Dominion - I'll never be a fan, but I'm at the point where I don't actively hate it. I'll play, but won't suggest it.

Dangerously addictive.  Has this timelessness quality to it that just sucks you in and won't let go of you until biological functions remind you of life outside of the game.  Got instantly hooked during the explanation of the rules.  My only concern at this point is that the cards might not sustain the constant shuffling required.  Excellent design and a positively brilliant game.  Bravissimo!

IMO, best card game ever with the highest replay-ability you'll ever get in a game - IF you get several of the expansions - and there's a lot, with no word on when they'll stop coming.

This was the first popular deck building game and is still far and away the best.

If you've never tried it, the core game is available online for free to play as much as you want - you'll have to pay for expansions, though. And if you like it enough to get expansions, I recommend buying the physical game.

It's not that Dominion is a bad game; indeed, when I first got it I really loved it. It's just that there are games that take its basic mechanic set, improve what's bad, and eliminate what's terrible. Effectively, this game has been iterated upon and improved beyond all recognition.

That said, it's unlikely to leave my collection because it is, frankly, the grandfather of the genre.

Easy to understand and teach.  I enjoy the elegant design of this game.  It doesn't have the heavier feel that causes me to give games a higher rating, but that doesn't mean I don't really like this game.  I really do enjoy playing Dominion.  My wife enjoys this game too.  She brings it out every evening for the two of us to play on the kitchen table.  We do the random Kingdom Cards setup each time and it's always an interesting game.

No doubt about it, my wife really likes this game.  I heard her teliing friends about it on the telephone.

BTW, my wife and I both enjoy playing this game against each other on BSW.  Removing all that card shuffling is good.  However I do not include these plays in my recorded game play counts at BGG.

RATING: 9
The granddaddy of all deck-building games still the best. My rating for the Dominion system is a 10: this rating of 9 is specifically for the first edition core set. Like most, I greatly prefer the cards in later expansions. If you're starting a collection or just want to play casually, you're going to want the [thing=209418]second edition core set[/thing].

Even knowing how many official Kingdom cards there are between all the expansions and promos, it's still amazing how different the game is every time. The other great thing about Dominion is that it literally has four or five rules, and everything else you need to know is on the cards, all of which are pretty self-explanatory. Every time I've played, I've offered to go over all of the Action cards with my opponents, but they've always declined and we've managed just fine.

We're working our way through the recommended sets included with each expansion as we get them. Lately, that's been the easiest way for us to get going with a game, as opposed to randomizing a set. Most of my plays are recorded under the base game, including games using randomly generated sets of 10 cards.

Speedy, casual game with a fantastic mechanic that allows massive replayability with a decent depth of strategy. The theme is rather irrelevant to the gameplay. It's possible to burn out on this game if you play it too much.

Duration: Fast, especially when there are fewer players.
Design: The rules are very simple and elegant, making this a great gateway game. The deck drafting is fantastic; you get a lot of control over your approach. The Kingdom card selection and the interactions between them keeps things fresh. There is a first player advantage, and limited interaction in some setups, especially with fewer players.
Strategy: You have many options, but there tend to be optimal approaches and suboptimal Kingdom cards. I play for fun and ignore them.
Components: The art style is all over the place, and some cards are sub par.
Theme: Generally there is little integration with the bland theme, but it happens on occasion (eg Bureaucrat, Thief).

Boy did I fall in love with this one right away. I still really like it. For the length of time you devote to any single game, I believe Dominion offers greater depth and variability (& re-playability) than any game I've ever played. Even without direct player interaction, this game forces you to balance what you want to do with what you see your opponents trying to do. I love the aspect of figuring out how to use the cards in combination, how to build a good deck. 

Two things happened that knocked the game down in my eyes. One (and this happens with games I play), I started playing it on BSW. I played hundreds and hundreds of games. I got really good at it. And I became obsessed with not only the game, but with my win percentage. So I overplayed, and stopped enjoying myself as I became obsessed with keeping my ranking up. So I quit playing all together. The other thing was, I realized that buying money is, for the most part, more important than buying action cards. The cards are what makes the game fun. When I began focusing on my money supply more than my action cards, I became a much better player. And I enjoyed the game a little bit less.

I came back to the game face to face after about 6 weeks of not playing, and realized I still really love it. It will never hold quite as much allure it once held. My gaming group absolutely loves this game, it is played often and well there.

EDIT: As of this writing. expansions up to Prosperity are published. I have again fallen heavily in like with this game. There are so many card set combinations, so many strategies, so many cool ways to play. I just love it.

This game is fun but it sure is fiddly.  I'm talking about all the card stacks, the shuffling and the post game sorting to straighten it all up.  For a card game it isn't very portable and hogs table space.  It seems like the kind of game where if your opponents have read strategy guides on the geek they will crush you every time.  The interactions of the cards are fun but really money is more important.  Going for the gold and buying provinces works well but takes some of the fun out of all the card combos.  Just when the decks get interesting the game is over.  Running out of provinces is a harsh game timer.  I can't get too excited about a game where my aim is to get a playing card with gold coin printed on it.  Not too much theme or interest there.  I suppose it scratches the Magic itch, like people say, but Magic the Gathering wasn't ever really boardgaming either.  

It feels like only part of a game to me, and I'd rather play regular board game for a more satisfying experience.  Still if you want a fast, fun filler and don't mind a lot of setup and shuffling, it's good.


Update:  Played a bunch, good solid game. Enjoy it when I play, but don't pine away for it. The shuffling feels like Fred Flintstone when he's running in place in the cartoons.  Doesn't go anywhere.

One of the first deck-builders which is showing its age a bit. Mechanically very solid, but thematically and gameplay wise a bit boring. Most of the cards are not that interest and a few are just annoying. I usually go for bigger money while destroying the starter bronze (if possible).

Since its release there have been many more deck-builders which expand and twist the mechanism in interesting ways. Dominion is still a solid game but doesn't do anything exciting for me.

Played once on BSW, and watched many games. Finally got my own copy and played 4 games in a row right away. Everyone loved it. I'll give it a 9 as an initial rating, but this could easily make it into my top 10 with more plays. I'm not usually one to buy expansions for games, but this one is a must. Excellent game.

UPDATE: OK, I tried to hold out, but after playing several more games I'm giving this a 10 and moving it into my top 10 list. Wow.

Oh, and I like the shuffling. I feel like it loses something on BSW. Yes, it's faster, but I like seeing my deck change and grow and the tactile fun of knowing that I'm adding new cards into my deck, and when they're being shuffled in. I've never sleeved a game before, but I just picked up sleeves for Dominion. We'll see how that goes.

My husband is Dominioned out. I love this game, but I am getting weary of teaching it to our friends - which is a shame because everyone loves it.

Love this game. Best quick game for two out there. Games tend to be really, really close too. Really scratches the economic itch for me in such a short time.  

Perhaps not the most interactive game but I don't mind that at all. In fact, I actually dislike the "interactive" attack cards.  Only thing is it is very repetitive and I'm not sure how much staying power this will have in the long run, especially since I'm hooked and playing it so very much right now.

I find that it takes awhile to figure out strategies that are effective, meaning experienced players will usually win. Despite this, I find it very fun to develop a strategy and try and make it work. I don't find the lack of theme to detract from the game at all

"The shuffling game".  This is a very intriguing game that I think is worth owning not just because it's so different from everything else, but because it's an engaging puzzle about building an economic machine that will help you rake in the victory points, while being a race game at the same time.  It presents the classic problem of "when do I stop focusing on getting money so that I can start grabbing victory points?".  While many of the tactical decisions are obvious, it's important to chart out the strategic course from the beginning of the game, and there can be a variety of paths to victory.

Fascinating card race game that let's players build their own decks while playing. 

+ Fresh & exciting idea
+ It's nice to try new tactics
- Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle...
- Very little interaction between the players
- Long combos every turn make Dominion a dull boy.

(Review based on dozens of plays)

Okay, this game is really very cool. Strong theme, expandable, simple to learn, and incredible replayability. I would recommend it to anyone. I've heard chatter that its a solution to the CCG, I don't know about that, but the endless combinations of plays combined with an underlying strategy of what a deck will contain certainly feels like the the same decision making process as a CCG without the big outlay of cash.

A fun light game.  Not as deep as some seem to think... you essentially decide on a strategy at the beginning and the rest of the game practically plays itself.  Use of the interactive cards (Witch, thief, militia, beurocrat) can compensate for this a bit though.

RATING: 6
If it weren't for the incredible pain of storage and set-up and shuffling and shuffling and clean-up this would be easier to judge. You end up spending way more time maintaining the game and going through the motions than playing it. And the game doesn't quite deserve that effort. Online play is genius though and cuts to the core of what I like about Dominion: A virtually infinite array of boards to assess and test at lightning speed.

RATING: 2
I am really finding it hard not to give this game a "1".  I guess there's SOMETHING to it, but I can't figure out what. It's simply an exercise in boredom and frustration.  You have this great "deck-building" mechanic, and then can't actually us it to any extend because you throw all your cards away every turn.  Besides the fact that you have your own deck, this has no similarity to a collectible card game AT ALL.

I was playing with folks that play Dominion often and like the game, and they would just quickly take their turn with even saying a word.  It was sort of like 6 people playing solitaire at the same table.  It didn't even allow for SOCIAL interaction, let only interaction related to the game. 

And I don't mind a decent luck factor in a game, but this game seems just rigged to be annoyingly UNlucky, no matter how much strategy you employ.

How is it at all possible that this is ranked so high?  One of the worst games I have ever played (and I have a fairly decent collection and games played). 

I guess if you want to sit around a table with a bunch of folks and shuffle cards quietly for an hour, this "game" is for you.

I like this game for what it is, Magic: The Gathering Lite.  Ironically enough, I rather loathe Magic as I find it impossible to keep up with (or care enough to keep up with) all the different cards and mechanics.  I feel like this game offers a fairly good mix of strategy and tactics, and I enjoy the idea of building an efficient deck whilst racing other players for the same.  Good set-up, component quality, and storage.  The card art is nice, if unremarkable.

Easy to learn. Not one of my favorites but it is the perfect game for me and my girlfriend who is a casual gamer. This game can be quick and for me has high replay ability. 

The artwork is mostly lame (full disclosure I am a huge mtg fan) and setup and tear down are easy but somewhat annoying at the same time. The boxes are pretty but a smaller box would have been nice (especially true when you get expansions.)

Played today for the first time. We were able to get 3.5 basic games in (I had to leave). Good time was had by all.

It took about 45 minutes/game. Fast playing and different every time with many avenues to build one's deck. Once the first Province (6 VPs and $8) is purchased usually triggers a VP chase. We played with  the basic 10 card-types although I believe there are 25 total card-types.

Lots of replayability and a relatively short playing time should allow it to fit in with most gamers' schedules.

There is a contingent of anti-deck building folks out there (that's ok, not every game is for everyone), so if you don't like deck builders or lots of cards, this isn't for you.

I enjoy playing this but it hasn't been getting a lot of love since newer, shiner deck builders have been coming out.

The building of your card engine and the comboing of cards is really a cool feeling. It plays quickly and is very smooth. People can pick this up very easily and enjoy seeing the deck that they have constructed churn out benefits. It's the fine tuning that takes casual players a bit longer to get - don't buy all of the shiny cards with nice actions all of the time.

The lack of interaction is fine. If you want more then play something else. Sometimes it's nice, especially for such a quick game, to sit back and build.

I really love Dominion and all its expansions: those improves it making it better and better in many ways.

This is probably one of the best engine/deck building games out there. It plays significantly different with 2,3, or 4 players and the strategies will change all the time. There is a uniqueness to the gameplay as the options for building your decks change every game. Throw in some expansions and you'll never play the same game twice. There is a significant difference between skill levels of new and experienced players. 

Plus: Deck building is fun and allows you to customize your play style.
Minus: Lots and lots of shuffling, get deck sleeves if you can find ones that fit nicely.

Is this a game to have in your collection:Yes
Is this a game children can play:Maybe
Is this a good game for new gamers:Yes

A fun engine building game that scratches a CCG itch.  Criticism of the lack of interaction is valid but not a big deal to me and, since the system is open for expansion I'm sure something will come along to make the game more confrontational.  The theme could be MUCH better but the game is just so fast and addictive that I'm willing to ingore this.

I don't get it. Even after the first game the mechanics already seemed rather obvious, repetitive, and uninteresting to me. While I applaud the idea of a card game that has all the advantages of a CCG without its disadvantages, this isn't it. I can't believe anyone who has seriously played M:TG finds this interesting.

Dominion is the perfect showcase that seemingly limitless permutations of possible card combinations do not equal limitless replayability. If all the big decisions have been made a couple of turns in and all the rest is played on autopilot what's the point?

I was worried that it's popularity meant we wouldn't like it. On the contrary, we love it and have been able to get a friend playing it who absolutely refused to play our "types" of games before he played this. I love that you can play several games in one sitting and not get sick of it because of the variety. I also love how we still talk about our hands hours after we finished playing. That means we had fun, and isn't that the point?
Unfortunately, now that I've played Race for the Galaxy, I prefer it over Dominion, and Dominion has had less plays as a result.

Fantastic game. Variable setup, satisfying engine-building, amusingly rickety theme (but who cares about that?). Surprisingly simple to teach and once people get the hang of it it almost always hooks them. Downtime is a bit of a problem with 4 but that's why you play it with 2 or 3.

Plays very much like a CCG, without the need for buying thousands of dollars worth of packs. The balance can vary wildly depending on the cards selected for any particular round. So any given game could be near-perfect, or be cluttered by scores of useless card choices.

I think this is one of the best games to teach new gamers. All the kingdom cards are right out there for you to explain at the beginning, or as they are able to afford them, and it's real easy to play as you go and correct them as you go. Further, just doing the basic strategy of buying silver until you can use it to buy gold is something a new player can do. I've done it while teaching others so they could see how their attack cards disrupted me.

Beware of trying to go nuts with combo cards. Oftentimes you only need to get a couple of cards in your deck.

I'm tired of shuffling.

I thought I would love this game as I am a pasteboard tragic. Nope. For me it is awful. There is no luck and players horde their solution to the puzzle it presents. It is played in near silence and as fast as possible to ensure that no hint of what a player is doing can escape to inform others at the table. Okay, maybe I was playing with the wrong group for me. But I don't regret getting rid of it as soon as possible.

2/28/2010: Dominion's biggest plus is that it's fast; the speed of the game gives it the feel of a traditional playing card game. 

9/11/11:  I'm downgrading this from "fun" to "okay" on my grading scale.  The more I play other deckbuilders, the less I want to waste time with Dominion.

RATING: 8
So yes I rated Dominion the same as Agricola. They are both equally fun in there genre.

I am not much of a 'deck builder' kind of guy but this game is quite fun. First you have all the cards you need. So, no need to spend more money on more powerful cards (like some other game).

The only issue I had with it was the price of the game. Over 50$ for 500 cards, a rulebook, a plastic cardholder and an oversized box. I don't care what people say about the art. This is quite expensive.

I love the game but I would recommend people to try it before they buy. This is the kind of game you want to be sure about otherwise I will sit on a shelf.

Very accessible for all levels of gamers but the more I play it, the more strategy I see.  You can balance the game between players of different levels of experience by upgrading/downgrading estates and/or copper in the starting hands.   Very little theme.

After two plays. Not as bad as I expected, but not great. Like Agricola, Caylus, Puerto Rico, ... There are too much exceptions to the rules (or too much rules) which is the lazy way of making a game replayable.

RATING: 6
I had an OK experience. Deckbuilding is a cool mechanism and now I want try some similar games to see if there are any others that are a better fit to my taste. This one is definitely a great design, but I didn't really like that I wasn't particularly motivated to pay attention to what the others were doing during their turns. Also the variety of the cards does not really add much to its replayability, at least for me.

Second edition fixes all problems the original game had. I have no qualms with recommending this game.

Making the construction of the deck the primary mechanic of the game was a stroke of genius. The shared supply of cards makes this title incredibly strategic. Its modular structure makes it easy to play over and over again.
The simplicity makes this easy to teach, but perhaps too plain for experienced gamers when another set with the base cards is available.

I have been working on this fan expansion since the release of Guilds.

It has seen some reworking recently. It has 21 publicly available functioning cards. 16 are highly stable: Alehouse, Arcanum, Architect, Countess, Fletcher, Friar, Frontier, Historian, Inquisitor, Inventor, Marquis, Prospector, Scholar, Slave Trade, Street, and Tanner.

A decent game, but certainly not the second coming that everyone on BGG thinks it is.  It is a reasonable short, efficiency exercise with lots of permutations.  The advantages are that you can play a bunch of games in row to kill some time.  Limited interaction with the base game.

I was a bit leary of all the hype this game was getting but having now played it, I can say it it's a pretty darn good game. It's no Race for the Galaxy in my opinion but I do like the idea of building your deck throughout the game. I've only played the basic game so far but I look forward to trying it with more of the cards.

RATING: 6
EDIT:  Obsoleted for me by several of its children.

---------------

A genuinely great little card game, deceptively deep.

Eurogamers have "claimed" this as one of their own, but this isn't a Eurogame.  It is truly the offspring of the CCG realm, ported to a single-box form.

Yeah, the theme is not there, but I can easily demonstrate how badly themed most CCGs ultimately are, how surprisingly abstract all but a few of them can be.  

Unlike Race for the Galaxy or Agricola, this one's probably truly worth the "hype."

Custom PnP on Poker Chips : Dominion + Intrigue set.

Dominion is a game that I loved initially, played it dozens of times face-to-face and tons upon tons of times on BSW.  I was completely enamored with it.

Now, I rarely play it, because several of the children it has spawned have eclipsed it, with more interaction, more confrontational gameplay, more theme, etc.  So while I still fire up the AI version for a quick fix, I haven't played the actual game in several, several months.

I'm bumping down my rating, but only a bit.  I rarely want to play this anymore, but I have a huge amount of respect for the game for generating a whole new genre.

But the common criticisms about the game are true.  The theme is thin, the interaction very low.  Also, the game peaked with Prosperity; Alchemy was pretty bad, but the expansions since Prosperity have all been worse than Alchemy on almost every level.  So the game too is getting worse with each expansion now.

One of those rare games that lives up to the buzz.  A wonderfully unique method of play, which turns your hand & deck into an efficiency engine.  Different card sets produce different feel of game.  Just a great card game, if possibly a little tad too long (25/10/10). UPDATE : Well, the spark never really turned into a flame - I will play it, it just does not bite me - rating reduced from 8 to 6 - but I am still willing to be convinced otherwise (24/12/11) UPDATE: I could possible be in the process of being convinced; rating raised to 7 (17/11/12). UPDATE: More plays and I'm convinced! Rating back to 8 (Dec 2013). UPDATE: Updated using v2 upgrade kit (Rating 8.173, Jan 17)

Me and my wife used to love this game. It was probably a favorite for both of us. For me it has been fading a little bit over the past years, but I still enjoy it a lot. I still wish it had more theme, but the gameplay still works great for me. Always challenging with the infinite amount of combinations you can make. Great with 2, but also with more players.

Also own:
-Intrigue: Brings more cards and the option to play with 5 or 6 players. It still works alright with 5 or 6, but is better with less.
-Seaside: We love Seaside and the cards that have more ongoing effects.
-Alchemy: An interesting concept with the potion cards, but it can be hard to get a good balanced set of 10 cards when you pull at random.
-Prosperity: The bigger money and VP values are great additions and make the game even more interesting.
-4 Promo Cards (Black Market, Envoy, Governor, Walled Village)

Dominion is a great way to get that CCG feel, without having to sink all your money into it.  It has a real neat Deck building mechanic. Trying to balance your need for Treasure, Actions, and Victory Points is the best part of the game! Dominion is the classic deck builder and still does it best when you need a simple card game with lots of choice and engaging game play.  One of my favourites.

[b]Why I got rid of it:[/b]

The first deck builder I ever played and definitely more strategic than any I've played since but I just didn't get it to the table much anymore. For a card game it's extremely un-portable and cumbersome and I don't think I really want to play games that have deck building as their sole mechanic.

At the end of the day, it's not a bad game, but tough decisions had to be made because I'm trying to thin my collection.

After 3 plays I think this game is overhyped. Or it's just not my thing. Okay, the ability to chain cards is fun and it plays fast enough for back-to-back plays, but after a while the gameplay isn't all that exciting. You just need to chain cards faster than other people. Can also descend into multiplayer solitaire if most players are unaggressive. I'd play Glory to Rome over Dominion any day.

An interesting little game.  After my first half-dozen plays this seems largely dependent on who can get their economic engine up and running faster.  The fact that early card draws can slant this favor to a player early on is a point of concern.  There is a fair sized variety in the cards, but I am not sure how this promotes replayability other than superficially.  I have enjoyed my plays more than those of RftG, but I am leaning to the side that this game is not deserving of it's hype (although still solid).  There are things here that remind me a lot of St Petersburg, but it doesn't quite feel as complete.

Mostly burnt out, but still willing to play every once in a while.  Quite fun the first 30 or so times, after that seeing most of the likely strategies and how often most action cards are only sparingly used I'm pretty much done.  It feels less like building a deck and more like making a few critical buys early in the game and then exploiting them.  The 1st-5th turns (with 3,4,5 being most critical amongst experienced players) are when games will be won and lost, anything after that is luck of the draw.

Playing Dominion gave me a new term to describe games:

A "bubble gum" game - lots of activity, big flavor at start but just a tastless chewy mass after a while.

My rating dropped to a "6" and I sold it off.

--------

We've played 6 more times now and yes, this is rather addictive.  We are still playing with the basic 10 Action cards.  The last three games we have been experimenting with combinations: which means concentrating on buying several of only a few of the Action cards.  In the last two games I've won with a Workshop/Remodel deck (4 of each) and then with a  Village/Woodcutter deck (4 of each).  I was giggling the whole time.  It really is fun to imagine that a combination will work and then to "try it" - the games are so short and painless that you can experiment till your hearts content.

-----

I'm bumping it to an 8.  

After 3 play I'll start Dominion at a "6".  This game has added a new term to my Vocabulary: a "bubble gum game" - one that is process heavy, is not too taxing.  It seems interesting enough to keep you playing it.  

There are a number of others like this in our collection, and we tend to play them fairly frequently, so I suspect that this will be a keeper.

I have only played with the basic set up so far.  The player interaction is exceedingly low with the basic setup.  Throwing down the Militia or buying out the last of a stack is about the only interaction I picked up on. 

Given that, I still had a good time and I'm sure I play it more when the opportunity arises.  The challenge is to decide when to stop investing in infrastructure and go for VP's.

We played Dominion (plus Seaside) until we were sick of it.  It's a very accessible game, even for people who aren't really gamers.  We're less likely to bring it out now, but I don't think that merits a drop in rating.  Of the various sets I've played, the cards in the original game probably are the most boring as they are the most generic.  However, no matter how much I think I understand Dominion strategy, the game continually surprises with interesting combinations or combos working better/worse than I expected.

My favorite deckbuilder.  So much replayability to an almost insane level.  Literally impossible to play each combination of 10 kingdom cards.  Had to sleeve these cards immediately from all the playtime they received.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The rules are extremely simple and it is very easy to learn HOW to play the game.  How to play WELL, however, is another matter.  There is an amazing amount of replayability, with 25 different cards from which you choose 10 for each game.  It's clear, also, that no matter the cards, there are different paths to victory.  After our slow first game during which we learned the rules, our second game went very, very fast.  Be warned, though - I think this is a very geeky game and although I consider it to be very light, it is definitely not something to break out unless you have fairly seasonsed board game players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I've mixed in all my Dominion cards, so I have trouble ranking the base game by itself. The base game, as I recall, was kind of bare. With a good number of expansions, though, became a glorious game. Dominion is what got me into modern board games (even though there's no "board," per se). The setup is a little tedious and time consuming (if you are picking through all the cards from all the expansions like I'm doing), but it's a great game to introduce to non-gaming friends and everyone always has a good time (provided there are not too many attack cards in the kingdom). I've since moved on to other games and hardly break Dominion out these days, but I still think of it fondly. As far as playing a game these days, I have trouble getting it to the table because of the following:

- Setup takes forever. Dominion is only fun with expansions, and with all the expansions, the card selection takes a long time, if you want to have a balanced game. Just pulling out the cards to make the kingdom and putting them back is too much time spent for how much game you get.

- Having played hundreds or thousands of games of Dominion on my phone, I'm kind of worn out on the game, and the tabletop version just feels sooo slooow (even though the human interaction is unmatched).

- The shuffling does get tiring, especially since there are cards in the game seemingly designed for apps and not physical card play (Philosopher's Stone, Scavenger, etc.).

- I didn't think the game was dry at first, back when I first got into the hobby, but after playing more thematic games that are just as strategic or more so, I simply crave more engaging / interesting games. 

- The giant box of Dominion cards is too much of a pain in the ass to pull out for a 30-minute game. 

Update: Just became too unwieldy (physically and gameplay-wise), and the setup-time/playing-time ratio was too burdensome, and our interest in other games too strong, to hold on to it.

Everyone loves playing this game. It's simple to grasp, difficult to master. There's no single best strategy and the constantly changing cards available for sale make each game unique. The Intrigue standalone allows the game to be played by 5-6 players. Good fun!

The first deck builder and still the best. There are some good new mechanics in deck building games that followed, giving some of them really fun and unique gameplay without just cloning Dominion (far from it. There are some drastically different deck builders). But Dominion still has the best mechanics that I've tried.

Dominion as a base game is fun, but you really need to add some expansions to get the replayability.  Dominion is probably the game that I have played the most out of all of the games that I own.  I guess that means I should probably give it higher than an 8, but I feel like that is where it belongs.  If you give a game a 10, what do you give games that are better than it?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
I really enjoy the diversity and various card combinations available.  I do find the limited player interaction to be a bit frustrating.  The game feels a bit like multi-player solitaire.  I also find it frustrating that the 'buy as much money as you can' strategy works so consistently in so many situations (depending upon the kingdom card set available, of course).  Hopefully these things will be improved in the expansion.  In spite of these shortcomings, I really enjoy playing and I am nearly always up for a game or two.

The true classic and still my favourite game. When first introduced to me 5 years ago the deck building mechanic was so unlike anything I'd ever seen before and still feels fresh today. With multiple expansions the number of possible games is truly astounding. THIS is the game I use to get other friends hooked on board gaming and it's worked (almost....) every time.

Just isn't balanced for new players.  Might be better if played with same group consistently.  Is a bit slow with downtime and minimal player interaction.

Theme is also extremely dry and uninteresting to me.

Despite the complete lack of a real theme, I love Dominion! The deck building mechanic works really well in this game. The expansions provide so much re-playability and variation that all options will never be exhausted. Awesome game.

The only reason this and Intrigue get 9 instead of 10 is that I think the expansions are what really make this game. It was impressive enough to play Dominion as-is (and remains a great way to introduce new people to the game), but without its expansion, the basic game seems bland now.

If you're a fan of nice, well developed mechanics, Dominion is a superior game. We have played it hundreds of times and it is still a favorite. The downside for me is that you come up with your entire strategy when you see the initial setup and there is very little decision making throughout the play of the game. Also, there is the potential for games to drag and a player to be so far out of the running that they just want to quit mid-game.

Ok I must admit that I was very very leary about this game. All I kept thinking was it was going to be similar to MTG and  Munchkin. Both of which I can't stand. Once the rules were explained to me. I was like ughhh. I am gonna hate this, but I must say I had a very fun time playing it. It was nothing like the two forementioned games that I despise. After my first play I had decided it was fun and I would surely play again, but didn't think it was something I would buy. So on the way home I was thinking about it more and more. Wondering what other cards there were and how they would come into play. Then I started thinking about all the endless combinations of games that could be played. Especially with the expansion and another expansion to be due out soon. So, after many hours of thinking about it. I wound up purchasing both the game and expansion and I am very glad I did so.

This game is just plain fun. It has endless numbers of possible setups for each game, which keeps things fresh. It plays quick and there is hardly any down time between turns what-so-ever. There's the possibility to pull off some incredible card combos, screw the other players and lots of strategies and tactics that can be used.

In fact I was told at the begining of my first play that I was going to suck at the game, because I wasn't familiar with the cards and how they worked. Well, I wound up tieing for first place, but can see this statement being very true. It takes a few plays to learn the cards and different ways to use them, but I picked up on things pretty quickly and did pretty well and had fun doing so.

So for anyone out there who still has doubts about this game. I say give it a try. I am not very fond of most card games, but am very glad that I took the time to try this game. It has a lot to offer.

Thanks to my friends Josh, Dave and Chris who introduced this great game to me. I am already excited about picking up the new expansion.

**UPDATE** This is becoming one of my favorite all time games. I just can't stop playing it. At first I thought they were coming out with expansion way to quick, but they both add so much more to an already terrific game.

Played this at Origins 2007 before Rio Grande picked it up, and again in 2008.  Interesting deck building non-collectible card game.  Lots of combinations, but the luck of the draw definitely matters.  You can buy a bunch of cards to counter your opponent's attacks for example, and draw them all when your opponents haven't drawn the attack card.  If you can live with that kind of luck (as one would expect with any card game), then this is an excellent game.  Also, the design is innovative, and deserves recognition for that.

It's really addictive.  Dangerously so, if I want to play other games.  And I'm not sure why - it's a deck-building game, and deck-building just tends to frustrate me.

I don't think it's as good as everyone else does.  It's good.  It's revolutionary, even.  But new and different doesn't always mean "good" or "great."

Dull as dirt, unless you enjoy shuffling cards-- a lot.
Multiplayer solitaire that is repetitive, unexciting, fiddly, and too long for its own good.

It is a card game but very strategic. Unlike many card games, the random element in Dominion is much smaller (or more manageable).

Yes, luck is still a critical factor because it affects what cards you ultimately draw from your deck, which determines your available actions. But you have absolute control over the probability because you decide which cards to buy and how to build your deck. Basically, you make your own luck.

As a result, the "buy" phase is the most important portion of the game. (Of course, the use of Chapel can be very strategic too, but that is a different topic).

Bought Saturday Nov 22, 2008 and tried for the first time only in May 2009.
After twenty plays or so, I would say that this game is at the same time :
- a pretty clever and very addictive game.
- a too mechanical and not so interesting game
To me, Dominion is really a gamig paradox :
- you feel like playing it and you don't mind doing a second or third game.
- you realize at the end how the quickness of it is due to the lack of real decisions to be made each turn.
If you buy it, no doubt you will enjoy playing it.
If you don't, you will not have missed the masterpiece of gaming.

It's all been said - deck building, points collecting etc. Dominion has that something. Something that makes a great, everlasting and addictive game. It's not the graphics (very mediocre by the way), it's not the theme (rather abstract) - it's the mechanics.

There are games now that try to recreate and reimplement the same idea - pointless and dull so far. Dominion is a game worth buying to every collection. Casual and hardcore gamer's alike.

You just have to respect the originality and elegance of Dominion. The game is simple to learn, very varied and has a reasonable amount of depth. However, I'm often not having quite as much fun as I'd hope when playing Dominion. The basic structure of deciding your strategy when you see the cards and then just playing it out does not appeal to me. Also, far too often the gameplay degenerates to me staring blankly at the opposite wall for three minutes at the time when one of my opponents does his draw-draw-draw-shuffle-draw-draw-draw-discard-draw-buy routine, only to complete my own turn in five seconds.

Why did I get this game? Because it had a lot of hype for me when I first started getting board games. Do I play it? Hardly... I prefer Arctic Scavengers because I'm usually at a serious disadvantage to people who have played more than me. As a rule, I prefer playing games where everyone is just a likely to win. Dominion rewards experience (which is okay in my book!) but I don't find it that appealing to play.

The king of deckbuilders, no debate. No game has managed to replicate the fast-paced, clean and combo-centric cardplay that Dominion offers. Extremely easy to pick up but with almost endless depth, it defines what a deckbuilder should be for me. A lack of player interaction and a horrendously pasted-on theme keep this gem from a masterpiece position, but non the less a classic in its own right.

An excellent game of connecting and interlacing abilities to drive your VP engine. Players start with basic cards and buy more cards with an array of abilities to be able to draw even more cards and gain gold needed to buy the more expensive cards and VPs.

But a great puzzel to be solved and the deck building play is great fun.

Coming back to this after Thunderstone blew it out of the water. This isn't as bad as I remembered after playing it to death when it came out. What really killed it for me was playing it on BSW, which was a big mistake. If a game like Dominion has no theme, then BSW is going to wring every drop of life out of it, since you play so quickly with no human interaction. 

The game itself can be pretty good with the right people. It's quick and has a lot of strategy, but is not overwhelming. 

The graphic design and theme is, of course, horrendous. But so be it.

Rating keeps coming down on this one as I play it more...just so incredibly dry and lifeless.

One of the two main games I use to introduce people to gaming. It's so easy to play. You make choices that affect you in the long run...even if "the long run" only lasts 30 minutes.

The theme isn't as bad as people say. I like MOST of the artwork, but the game could play just as well without ANY artwork.

It's fun to analyze the cards you've set up on the table, and figure out a plan of what you're going to buy to get that currency/vp engine going.

The only bad part is that it is difficult to affect other players (without curse cards). Unless you are counting and keeping track of every players points as they buy them you are not going to really feel any tension. (It's not hard to do...but annoying that you have to. Maybe if someone invented a points track that was visible as you played?)

11/17/15: Probably the only bad thing about this game, at least in this version, is that I'm not much of a fan of the player interaction. Witch = spam curses. Militia = reduce cards. If your opponents are using those cards, you have to take them into account, but with Militia that usually means very little unless you're running a lean deck via Chapel, and with Witch, your only real options are to Chapel or to Witch right back. I actually hate the Witch because its existence in a kingdom means that you are forced to deal with it. I hear later expansions do player interaction better.

But that's really the only con, because otherwise this game is amazing. So many options to choose from. So many possible strategies: big money and its variants, draw-engines, combos -- I love it all. Would always be very happy to play this game.

Dominion.  I the games to progress quickly.  So I am a little picky about card selection.  But I do enjoy creating games at random.  The expansions are required to keep this game interesting over time, so I have them all.  Quite possibly my wife's favorite game.

Nice card game that Í play occasionally. Down side of the basic game that it doen't involve that much interaction with the other players. You mostly work on your constructing your own deck.

I traded for a copy. Looked in the box, saw all those endless rows of sorted cards and quietly put it away. Got the rules out a while later, didn't really gel on what the game was about, put it away again.

Finally I discovered an online verion at goko.com, and after watching the bots cream me a few times it finally clicked. What a neat game it is. I had never encountered 'deck building' before, and now that I know what it is, it is very well executed. Of course familiarity with the cards would help tremendously with long term strategies, and I haven't played it enough to know if any of those strategies are pretty much 'givens' or not.

Also, there are a *lot* of cards. *Lots* and *lots* and *lots* of cards. And the endless recycling of the decks, the ever longer chains of action cards...I honestly can't see myself wanting to do it with real cards. :) So I'll be sticking with online play for this one.

After years of play and owning all of the expansions, we still pull this out once a month or so. And quite a bit when a new expansion comes out. I love trying to solve the puzzle of finding the quickest path to victory and how to optimize one's deck.

Good game.  But a bit solitaire though.  I like Magic:tg a lot better (when drafing/playing cube ofcourse).  Dutch translation (of the first printing!) isn't very good, btw.

Addendum: Gets better after you've played more.

Addendum: Gets worse if you're main playing partners don't advance/learn the better strategies on the same level as you.  Yes, if you know the cards and interactions and strategy a lot better, you'll win a lot more games.

A good chill-out game. The best "solitaire" style game I played (way better then Race for the Galaxy).

Interesting creating deck mechanism. But the game itself is far simpler then I expected from the hype. The only decisions are during buying cards. Choosing your actions is obvious. Besides, there's too much card shuffling.

Edit: After last game I'm starting to kind of like it. But I still don't feel it's great. Just OK.

Edit2: There was an second hand bargain, so I bought it :-) 

Edit3: I played it a few times on BSW and I really start to enjoy it. Wow, it took some time to click in, but now I found it very fun. Although I'm not good at building my deck and memorizing what I have in it. The whole thing was to start enjoying the proccess of building your deck towards the victory. I finally did.

Edit:4: Whoa, my wifes really enjoys it and she often wins with me :-)

Anyway, the rating went from 5 to 6 and now 7.5

A fantastic deck card building game that is one of the best and more fresh ideas created in the last years in the boardgaming industry. I dont think that its deepth is comparable to other games like the classic euro games but it is still a very fast and enjoyable card game, which offers a lot of decissions and options for its short playing time. Dominion base game has been expanded with several aditions that offer new paths to victory and improves the game a bit. I would rate Dominion core game with an eight, but combined with some other expansions it reaches a better qualification and its top 10 status is fair enough to me, although is not one of my favourite games ever it works very well with many kind of players and it is a worthy addition to almost any collection.

Fabulous game! A deckbuilder how a deckbuilder should be. We are also great fans of the Marvel legendary Deckbuilder, but that doesn´t change our opinion about Dominion.
The way it plays is just great! 

One advice, don´t read any strategy´s on BGG... Otherwise the fun is over. Just play and explorer yourself.
We like it the most with attack cards, so you can influence the other persons deck.. 

Fantastic game

First Play Dec 08 - Interesting mechanics and nice box.  I worry about replayabiltiy despite the 25 "different" decks.  Plays quite solitaire, and even with the interactive cards, there is little you can do to "protect" yourself, either you draw a moat or you don't.  Which basically turns the game into a race to see who can acquire most VPs through maximum efficiency.  Probably not deserving to be in the Top 10.

Addendum: It's also soulless with a paste-on theme (might as well just have cards saying +1 action etc, I don't really care what they are). 4.2/10 after 5 plays.

A deckbuilding game beyond compare. Each player starts with game with a simple deck of a few resource cards and victory point cards, then has a chance to add to that deck every turn by buying cards or (sometimes) via action cards. Each newly acquired card becomes part of your deck, cycling through with the rest of your discards when your draw pile is empty. A randomizer mechanic allows for interesting variety in the available cards to purchase.

The original deckbuilder is still a fine game and the ridiculous amount of expansions mean that it'll never get boring. The mechanic has evolved though and the minimal player interaction has made me move on from this game.

RATING: 8
The immense depth of strategy makes this game as addicting as nicotine. As soon as you've played, you want to go back and try again - which is something you can actually do with this game because of the manageable play time.

It reminds me of heavily strategic games like Starcraft. Managing a balance between early and late game, different play styles and strategies that are so variable and yet mesh so well. This game is a classic.

I'm looking forward to trying this with the expansions, but I feel like even after enough plays to wear down the edges of the cards, I can still squeeze plenty of worth out of the base game. Great value for the amount of times you'll play.

I LIKE this game. But i must say, playing it with former Magic players is annoying. I know the basics of deck tuning, but don't take tto it automatically. So I'm still playing thematically, while the next two players are biting at the bit to go. Once my turn completes, they go wam wam wam, and all I really see is what changed.  I actually liek to see how the Village got the Blacksmith to get more cards, and so now you've got 5gp instead of 2.

After quite a few plays on BSW my opinion has changed from mildly enthusiastic to boredom.  Most players on BSW are like me and have an average win % around 50% and since most people play 2-player games that means we are just winning our share.  Then there are the rare players that have a very high win %...these are the "card counters" who can keep track of what's in the hand, draw deck and discard piles (or come pretty close to it).  So for most of us players, it is just kind of a random outcome; for a few there is a great deal of skill.  I've never been good at tracking cards and don't really want to expend that kind of effort.  This is one of those games that fools you into thinking you are actually doing something when in reality, unless you are one of the rare talented card counting players, you are just fooling around.  Won't play this much anymore.

Pasted on theme, rather unatractive artwork and graphic design, and shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, make this a totally meh game. Its saving grace is that it is fast game, allowing many better games to come to the game table afterwards.

RATING: 10
This is my favorite game, and because of what it has meant in my progression of games, it probably always will be.

I think it is flawless in terms of mechanics, and it meshes so well with the expansions that came after it.

I understand that some people don't like the lack of theme (doesn't bother me one bit), and some people just don't like deckbuilding games, and there's a big chunk of people that don't want to like something that is this popular.

Either way, I think you have to admire and marvel at how intricate and developed the strategies for this are, given the cloak of simplicity it is with it's rules of "draw, play, buy, repeat."  

I can't say enough about this game.

This game is good, and I can see why it's considered one of the greatest games ever made.  But it's not my personal favorite.  That's due more to personal tastes than anything else.  There is a very good amount of strategy in choosing which cards to get, but there's also luck of the draw, though you're pretty much digging your own grave if you buy too many good cards that prove useless if they dilute your deck each game.  On the other hand, there are some cards that are good no matter how many of them you buy, and that puts me off a little.  It may be good strategy, but I can't help but see it as a cheap strategy.

Personally, I prefer Ascension over this.

The concept of this game is great. It's so easy, the rulebook could be 2 pages long instead of 10 (most of it is a detailed list of card effects). Of course the simplicity of the rules doesn't block using a lot of different strategies. And when using random settings, you would probably need a lifetime to see them all. Why not a higher score? Pretty much a non-existent theme.

Reasons behind selling - didn't see enough play, game groups are not interested in it.

I'm not sure I understand the hype surrounding this one.

The mechanics (ie. deck building) are really not that innovative, since that's been around for close to 20 years now. So, why this seems like a novel concept is beyond me, except that you get the entire card set in a single box. The only thing really novel here, is that building your deck is actually part of the game...but it feels that's all there is to it, and there's nothing else inside the box, really. It's too bad too, since I was looking forward to this one, as I was really into MtG long ago, and was looking forward to something similar like this (all the cards needed to play in one box). 

The mechanics are rather dry, bland, and well, mechanical. The theme is so tissue paper flimsy, you could stick anything on the cards and it wouldn't matter. This is MtG for Eurogamers; no player interaction with a single simple mechanic; shuffle until you develop carpal tunnel... 

As a designer, I also find the font to be ugly, and hard to read, and again, has little to do with the theme, except that the wordmark kind of looks like it's trying to be related to Old English or something similar. The card backs...erk...turquoise, navy and khaki...'nuff said. 

So much could have been done with this games' theme (another dry, medeival euro-game *yawn*), and art, but it has neither. The theme is tacked on to attract the euro crowd, and I can see no other reason for it.

Seriously, there's just some cool mechanics here, with very little actual 'game' inside. Believe me, I looked really hard inside that box, and there's just some interesting mechanics, and little else to keep me interested. Just not my type of game I guess.

It's a game I've tried to finish on several occasions, but the Lady and I get too bored, and move onto other games we find more interesting and fun.

Dominion is a 2 to 4 player game in which the main mechanic is deck building.

You read that right, this game is more about the deck of cards you end up with than the cards you play in the game. I find it a very original approach which will no doubt be copied in the future by other games.

It’s a medium/light game that takes about 30 minutes of play, very simple to grasp and with a good amount of choices. It’s one of my favorite "filler" games already and I’m always ready to play it.

The objective of this game is to end up with the most victory points in your deck, seeing as those victory serve no purpose on the deck while actually playing, there is a balance to be maintained between cards you can play and cards that will ultimately make you win.

From 2 to 4 players.
Ages 8 and up.
Playing time: 30 to 45 minutes.

We've given this game a dozen or so tries and it's just not for us.  I think we don't like it because the theme isn't really there and we like to get lost in the stories of our games.  Also, we've learned that we don't really care for deck builders.  But the real deal breaker for my wife and I is that we played a couple games without even speaking.... even when we played the "interaction" deck, there was very little interplay between players.  It felt like we were both racing each other in a game of solitaire.

I did some more research online and discovered one of the reasons why people rate this game so highly - the statistical weight of cards and the strategy that can be employed once you know all of the cards, but in the end, it's a card game, and we were looking for a board game.  

Not for us, good to know, as this info will help inform our future game purchases.

UPDATE (several months after the sale)... I've been thinking more about this, as I was recently looking into Android Netrunner LCG.  It never occurred to me to think of Dominion as an evolution of the Magic: The Gathering format.  I think this is where my dissatisfaction came from... I was approaching Dominion from a mindset that wanted to play a board game, and I found a card game.  Had I approached it from the mindset of wanting to play a game like MtG but not deal with the CCG or LCG aspects of it, that would have positioned it better in my mind.  I might give this another try someday.  Just wanted to share my thoughts.

UPDATE:  Nah, forget it.  There's plenty of games out there. No repeats!

great, addicting game! i honestly didn't think i would enjoy it at first (due to the seemingly lack of direct interaction), but i'm glad to be proven wrong! there's definitely quite a bit of player interaction (i.e. reacting what your opponent is buying/playing). i love how this game offers many nuances. it's always exciting trying to figure out the different card combinations that would optimize my way to victory. hands down, one of my all time favorite games (even though i'm usually losing most of the time)! but who knew losing could be such a blast? only con i can think of is the fact that it can suffer from some downtime if you play with noobs. (apologies to my opponents!)

Excellent strategic card game with quite low random chance.

Pros:

+ Very high replay value,
+ Good mechanics, fast and easy game play - good playing time,
+ Simple rules, easy to get to play for beginners,
+ Aesthetics are good, cards are nice looking.


Cons:
- Shuffling could be done differently, depending on player, some don't like to shuffle cards at all,
- Not easy to follow how other players are handling their cards.

Very enjoyable with 3, 4, 5 players.  Some combinations of the cards (you use 10 out of 26) are more exciting than others - and some games take longer than others because the cards may be more or less conducive to collecting the required victory points or other cards.

I liked Dominion quite a bit at first, then went through a period where I lost my desire to play the game. It suffered in comparison to Race for the Galaxy, which I can play endlessly without feeling like I've exhausted its depth. In comparison, Dominion was much less challenging and much less interactive. In Race for the Galaxy, I feel like I'm playing against the other players. In Dominion, I feel like I'm playing against the 10-card tableau for the round.

But I'm now playing Dominion again and enjoying it. The key for me has been to play it less often and with more realistic, mature expectations. Dominion is what it is. It doesn't have the depth of Race for the Galaxy, but it does have good depth in comparison to its ease of play. There's just enough depth there to keep me engaged rather than playing on autopilot. It has found its niche as a very light game that can and should be played very quickly. If it were easier to set up and tear down, I would play it more often.

Came much too late to this party. Picked it up in hopes that my wife might like it, but she hates it too.

Keeping Core Worlds - but as Howard Stern says, it's enough already.

Even though the replay value is high considering all the different card combinations, I think I've overplayed this. Or I need to play with non-beginners more. It's often a go-to starter game for us with non-gamers.

RATING: 8
The hype was true and this might be the first card game getting a 9 later on and it's without doubt better than Race for the Galaxy, as it's more easily accessible for non-gamers. But even if it's the best filler game I've played, I'm afraid that it might fade due to missing depth after 20 plays or so.

RATING: 10
This game runs like a Rolex, and can become an addiction for the right group.
Warning: Aside from the addiction properties, the theme is simply window dressing. You're supposed to be building a kingdom by investing in new properties and ventures that allow you to buy bigger, nicer, huge tracts of land. 
Yes, that was a Monty Python reference. 
But behind the window dressing is a card game you can't put down, which scales perfectly from two to four players, 5 or more if you buy the Intrigue expansion, and there are expansions galore. 
You'll want all of them.

Simplicity itself, the game can be explained in an A, B, C, fashion.
You and your opponents start with the same hand of ten cards: seven Treasure cards that represent money you can spend on more cards, and three Estate cards that represent victory points at the end of the game. 
Each turn you draw five cards from your deck. You can play action cards you've purchased which enable you to take additional actions and/or buy additional cards. As you progress, you can chain these action cards together like a hipster on a five-minute smoke break. After your actions you spend Treasure cards in your hand to purchase new action cards, or cards that represent new lands and add to your victory point total at the end of the game. After you've taken your Actions,(A)and completed your Buying(B), then you Clean up(C)by placing unused cards from your hand into your discard pile, draw 5 cards from your growing supply deck, and the turn moves to the next player. Play continues till someone buys up the last, most-expensive land card, then each player removes only the land cards from their decks, totals the points, and whoever has the most points wins.
That's it. I've just covered the rules for you. There are a few more, but they hardly matter or even factor into the game. It's brilliant I tell you!
And so efficient!
Sometimes things happen so quickly, that it's already your turn before you can shuffle and draw your next five cards. Dominion is easy to teach, develops critical thinking, is constantly evolving with expansions, and is never the same twice.
This is the card game you use to show people that there is something else out there besides UNO and spades.
Slap some Dominion on them and you'll have a new minion in your board and card game empire. They will allow you to teach them other board games because you will have gained their trust. 
Yes, wide-eyed trust. Such a valuable commodity, trust.
Trust is where you start. Once you have gained their trust, the rest is easy.
You may now invite them over for tea and cake. 
They will come willingly. 
Oh, yes. 
Willingly.
They will come...

Not since Carcassonne have I been blown away by a game like I was the first time I played Dominion. I tried the other top games, Agricola, Puerto Rico, Power Grid, all good games. But none gave me the impression that this game has given me. 

12-30-09: Beginning to lose some steam for me. Just got my gf Seaside and we don't find ourselves itching to play. I do love trying to put together great combos and love the new options available with the expansions, but even with the different action cards the game still feels the same from game to game. And I sure am getting tired of shuffling.

Now days, I mostly play on BSW. So much easier and quicker. Will play F2F if I want to use cards from the expansions not available on BSW.

RATING: 9
This was an instant attraction for me and my game group and this was the most played game in 2008, which is a feat considering that I got the game in November. One reason behind this is of course the play time or what game it packs in that time. My general thoughts about most short games are that they are too similar when played many times. With this game the change of the kingdom cards changes the game every time making it feel fresh every time I’ve played it. There isn’t a really deep game in this, but the strategies are subtle enough to make it worthwhile to play again and again making it the perfect filler.

At first I played only the preset decks and I think they are fun as there are generally a few strategies to play with them, but I have slowly abandoned that for mixed sets not because they are bad, but more that it feels fairer. I have also tried it with drafting and it works fine that way too. Generally I prefer faster sets to slower as the game can seem to drag a little. That was especially true in the beginning where most games ended with Province exhaustion.

Expansions make this game shine even more. Once you get the strategies try to get an expansion. This will shake the strategies and make things different.

2008 acquisition.

Initial impressions are quite positive.  We used the recommended first game card set.  It was quite fun acquiring cards and building your deck.  If you collected your cards right, you could setup some nice combos which could be frustrating to your opponents.  There was a lot of shuffling involved especially early in the game as there weren't many cards in the deck.

Dominion, un juego de cartas, pero no es un mazo contra otro, sino que es el que construya el mejor mazo, el que tenga más sinergia y el que logre conseguir mayor cantidad de puntos de victoria, las instrucciones son bastante sencillas pero uno puede darle muchas vueltas al tema para lograr formar una buena estrategia.
Cuando juego con mis amigos que ya lo conocen hacemos una especie de draft para elegir las 10 acciones que estarán presentes en el juego, dando opción para banear algunas cartas e ir eligiendo algunas en función de otras que ya se han elegido.

RATING: 6
Gamers who like TCGs or CCGs for their mecanism of deck building should be interested in this one as deck building is kind of the core of this game. So it's still kind of innovative as a new game in 2008 but not too strong on interaction. I own the german edition and I must say that they failed in supervising the print process. Comparing it to the Rio Grande version, colors have slightly changed from realistic to colorful and most of all they're darker, much too dark! I feel with the illustrators that must now see their work devaluated by a suboptimal print run. Shame on this evitable publisher mistake. This was just a remark on color trueness. The print quality or ergonomy is no problem.
Otherwise a really good game even if I sometimes get stressed by the constant "shuffle your deck". As the general reception is good I bet there will be some expansions for Dominion.

PS: Any literal similarity from the "Moneylender" to me is pure hazard :devil:

Update: I didn't even log 10 games and it already feels worn out. Lowered my rating from initial 7.5 to 6. Creating chains with +1 Action / +1 Card is just too uninteresting and repetitive.

Famous for having sat on my shelf for almost a year before we got around to trying it out. Until then I had only owned and played Carc and Catan and had asked and gotten Dominion for Christmas one year. Played it with the wife and with friends and everyone loved it, and I felt so stupid for waiting so long! The first game that the wife really enjoyed, and the fact alone will net it a high rating for me (though I love it too).

Played 50+ times. This sure is an easy game to get into. The first time I played I could see it would be a crowd pleaser. I feel no desire to get any additional cards. I am happy to play if there isn't the time for a more meaty game and I think its ability to please all will see it getting to the table often. Jun 09

*UPDATE* The play testing for Dominion and its add-ons must have been very thorough because with all the combinations I have never found a randomly selected group of cards give a bad gaming experience. I am moving this up to a 10 after my 50th game. July 2011

HUM!
Not a great fan of games WITHOUT any theme whatsoever.
It has very interesting mechanics and it is certainly a deep game. But I do not play chess nor traditional card games because they have no theme, and so I cannot imagine anything out of the game I'm playing. 

I'll play this game, but even if I recognize at its heart a perfect machine, I will always prefer TALISMAN to it. 

***UPDATE***
Ehm... I have to reconsider my rating after playing this game over the net. 
I think it is a very well made game, and it is entertainig. I will change my rating to a fat "8", it does not deserve a 7 or a 7,5. 

UPDATE
I think this game really shines as the most original creation of 2008. I'll give it a 8, highly recommended for anyone gamer or non-gamer.

Still a good game, but getting tired of it. I greatly prefere Race for the Galaxy to this one.

This is the game that convinced me that I was right to get back into playing board games. The mechanics are fresh, the game is fairly easy to teach to others, and the game can move very quickly. The only thing that stops this from being a perfect game is that, despite all of the randomness, there isn't much there to keep the game balanced. If one player understands the kingdom setup better than the others, then that player is going to win without much opposition. This makes it difficult for new players to play with more experienced ones - and thus keep them interested in playing the game.

Dominion is very fun, with the right group of people.  There are some drawbacks from a personal perspective.  The theme is pretty thin, but works if you have an open mind.

It's not often a genuinely new mechanic comes along. This has it. More importantly, it's lovely to play, and reasonably deep, to boot. 

The new mechanic has been recycled (pilfered wholesale) by many games now, but I think Dominion gets the complexity level about right - i.e. not very.

And to those who criticise it for "lack of theme", I say "pah!". It's got just the right amount of theme - enough to help you mentally navigate the game, but not get in the way.

A deck building game. Nice, but somehow the medieval theme is arbitrary and does not reflect in the gameplay. The same applies to the card actions. Alltogether it's just NOT like a TCG. Additionally it is almost not confrontational.

Fun game.  I've been debating buying this.  I am not convinced that this game is worth it for me.  The amount expansions also keep me at bay because I know I would want them all.

Broke down and bought this with all the expansions.  The more I play, the more I love this game.  Upgraded from 7 to 10.

Note: This comment is for the Dominion's base game & all of it's exps.

My best friend bought me a copy of Dominion without looking into the game and knowing the vast amount of exps last year. And I was hooked. The deck-building mechanic is one of my favorites to draw me into a game.  

Rating = 8 due to it being a very good game, wish the exps matched the based game and some of the exps components felt like it withdrew from the base game. I will never turn it down if someone wants to play it and will keep it in my collection.

downscaled it from 9 to 8 (with less then 50 games of play). The idea is great (and i don't need all those expansion, intrige is good enough). Nice to get slapped from an unseen combo, when the ooh's and aah's are gone, it's a bit to repetitive.

[Update] The fun is discovering the combo's when any combination of 10 cards are layed out. With intrige compared to the base-game you have more interaction/screwage factor :). Getting your engine running and then it's off to the finnish.

I liked it then and I like it still.  I like highly thematic games, and while you couldn't describe this as such, its colourful enough to keep me interested.  It provides an intense 2 player experience, which I like, and a more friendly 3-4 player experience, which I also like.  Wouldn't play with more than 4 though.

It created the deck builder genre. It's a fun game. I like it a lot. What else, really? Yes, the genre has evolved since it was designed, and it has some glaring flaws compared to more contemporary deck builders but it still holds up, especially when you don't have friends who are into board games as much as you are!

A great game that combines the deck drafting fun of CCGs, without the consuming desire to always be purchasing more, more, more!  Lots of interesting sets, scales well from 2-4 (though with 4 it has some downtime).  More players changes some strategies and brings more excitement to the game.  The near infinite possibilities of combinations is incredibly satisifying play after play.  The only real problem is that newer players are pretty much bound to lose.

Some good decisions on what you choose to buy, however hands nearly play themselves.  Never really felt like I was playing a game much with other people, though.  Nice art, not collectible, fast playing are all good.  Repetitive and somewhat dull play in my opinion.  It just feels too much like a CCG, a genre I've never liked.  I'd recommend it to someone moving over from CCG's to other games, though.

You play your whole hand, and it's easy to decide what to play when you get your next hand, perhaps too easy.  Maybe good as a time waster, but not something I'd play for any duration. meh.

The deckbuilding game that started it all. I'm a fan of thematic games, and Dominion really doesn't have a unified theme. Still, it has a great atmosphere of subdued tension, aided by the excellent card art and some pretty smart interactions in the cards. The expansions generally help the gameplay. I don't love this game, but when Lord of the Rings LCG or Game of Thrones LCG aren't a good thematic match for the night I'll break this out instead.

A clever, near-perfect game that started a genre, with incredible variety in how each game plays out thanks to randomized setup and expansions.  It's ideal for beginning through advanced gamers, and while advanced players will very likely win, it's a mostly nonconfrontational game that encourages exploring and learning.  Hard to give this game enough praise.

I don't like deck building games. There's just way too many cards, with too much stuff on them. It's just cards, cards, cards and collecting them. No real theme to the game, no real feel, just shuffling cards. So sad. 

Game similar to this one is: London. Also a game I can't get into.

Best game ever.  Easy to learn.  Game plays differently every time based on which cards chosen.  Everyone has same chance since cards are shared.  Multiple strategies can be used in every game.  Clever stacking of cards makes it even more varied.  Expansions available to make it even more varied than that.  Can be played in less than an hour.  Favorite game so far.

A very neat game that scratches the old CCG itch pretty well. Each player builds a deck of cards throughout the course of the game. Everyone can see what's available and being taken by the other players. There is a small feeling of solitaire in the basic game setup, but with so many ways to vary the game, I don't think that will be a problem long term. After two games (3 player, 2 player), I think the 2-player version is a bit lacking, and takes too long. However, that might have been due to unfamiliarity with the game. Looking forward to more plays. 

UPDATE: Four-player was excellent.

UPDATE: Played again with experienced players and the game moved MUCH more quickly. This really makes all the difference. Played quickly, the game is just excellent.

I really don't know why anyone compares this game to Magic: The Gathering, aside from the fact that it's a card game with art on the cards.  Perhaps it's because this is a deck building game and the process of building your deck to play Magic is often the most fun part?  The main difference here of course is that deck building IS the game of Dominion and not something you do alone surrounded by stacks of cards.
Easy to teach, learn, and play, this game still has complex strategy as the best built deck will almost always be the winner.  Also, the variety of starting set ups gives this game tremendous re-playability.

Dominion is just a genius game. No dice, no board. Just you, your cards and your wits. The exponential variety to this game is my favorite aspect of it. The original Dominion has simple cards, but they are still strong and I often mix in the original Kingdoms with other sets. 

An easy Ten from me. Even after playing for a few years.

RATING: 7
This is a themeless game that everyone in my play group loves and it is slowly growing on me. My enjoyment of the game depends very much, however, on what cards are available that game. The basic goal of using cards to get money to buy VP is boring, and I prefer cards that encourage player interaction or require planning to pull off big combos. In other words, the game doesn't come to life for me until you add in the various expansions, particularly the intrigue expansion. But it is a fine game that I usually enjoy, mostly because I'm playing with friends.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I love this particular idea of deck building, and I loved the first plays. My BIG issue with this game is that many cards don't work at all or are mispriced. There are many good cards that cost as little as 3, and quite a few powerful cards that cost only 4. And then there's all of those cards that are priced at 5 and even 6, which are just not that good. 

This game should thrive on the diversity of its cards and the different ways to build a more and more powerful deck fast. Unfortunately, the game doesn't accomplish what it sets out to do. You can focus on just buying money cards, completely disregarding all the other cards, and do quite well. This fact means that the game is broken, it doesn't live up to its potential.

It is said that this "big money" problem is remedied by its expansions. To me that means that in order to unbreak the basic game you need to buy its expansions...? Then the original game just isn't as good as all that. It is also said that problem is remedied by playing the game even more often once you run into it. Unfortunately, the problem sucks enjoyment out of the game, so why play it more often?

It took me a long time to try this game as I thought it was overhyped by BGG like Agricola, which I don't find to be something I want to play often.  After buying and reading the rules, it seemed even less like a game I'd enjoy.  But once I played it, I quickly became addicted and bought both expansions within a week.  Plays fast and enough difference in what cards are used that it really does seem like a different game every time, especially with the expansions.

Always variation with cards, there's so many possibilities. Just 1 or 2 expansions opens up a lot of gameplay variations. And it is very social. Since it is deck building you most of the time spend time on your own deck and thus it is not that aggressive playing. Therefore people don't become enemies such as when playing monopoly. Also, if you've played it a lot with your friends it can be very social when you have something to do all the while you're talking about life and so on. I highly recommend 1 or 2 expansions to this game though to open up more possibilities. But the core game is fun too. Simple, but still complex.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Scores higher for accessibility, quick play time, and fun.  I consider this a filler game, but as such it is top of the class.  Expansions beyond the base set are almost required to really bring out the potential, so it loses a point despite being the best filler game.

If played with Prosperity, I would increase this to an eight.  That expansion adds more decision layers.

Yes, the game that launched a thousand terrible deck builders, and it's still the best of the lot. I like games that can be simulated easily so that the math is obvious. Dominion is one such game-- half the fun is looking at the 10 kingdom cards and minmaxing before turn 1.

RATING: 8
I resisted falling for the hype of Dominion. Eventually I applied my rule of "try any game at least once" to see how it appeals to me. I only played other deck building games rarely, but this seems to be the best of that genre. I like the non-collectible nature of D. But, it will cost some $ to get the expansions. I was able to get the base game on a great sale price to give it a try.

Update: Because this had become my wife's favorite boardgame, I'd ended up playing this much more than other games. With just the base game and Dominion Intrigue, it was starting to get a bit stale. Now we've gotten Cornucopia (12/2011) and Seaside (4/2012) as gifts from our kids. The number of combinations is much larger and means more situations to see who can find a faster path to victory.

It is good for use with friends who are infrequent and/or light game players.

A very well made deck building game. The idea being to build your deck to acquire more victory points then your opponents.

Victory cards have no function until the end of the game (at least in base set) so you don't want to buy them too early, but if you leave it too late the game might end before you have enough points to win. So you have to pick the right time to start buying victory cards.

The attack cards give interaction between players, and if play continues while you do cleanup phase it plays every quickly and there isn't much downtime between turns and you will spend the time between turns thinking of what to buy.

Heard about this game for a couple of years now, and finally picked it up because none of my other gaming friend had.

Totally addicting gameplay, wow. I have only played it a few times, but the incredibly simple mechanics and HUGE array of setup and play options are really amazing. Every game feels different, and requires different strategies.

The combos available here rival MtG for their breadth, even if the base game has limited options. Unlike MtG though, I don't have to keep spending $800/yr to keep up with this game.

I'm usually not much for expansions, but Dominion cries out for them. Will be keeping an eye out for more.

Yup, I'm hooked.  It's fiendishly brilliant in its simplicity, and actually includes a little interaction and vaguely theme-connected mechanics (i.e. you buy a moat, but it's not ready to defend you until it's built... when you draw it again) for an otherwise standard engine-building Euro.  After about 20 plays it lost a bit of luster, but I can still see enjoying this for quite a while, especially when more cards become available to mix things up further. 

Update: I've been playing this more on BSW using the "setup" option, where everyone choosed what action cards to use before the game, and that has really reinvigorated my love for this game.  Some very interesting combinations of cards and strategies...  This has legs, after all.

RATING: 8
This game rocks!  It fast, its exciting, it offers lots of different tactics and it has a brand new game concept which is simple and elegant.  A lot of people have compared Dominion to Magic the Gathering but even though both games are about building a deck of cards they play very differently.  

In Magic you have to build your deck *before* the game starts which means that you have to take a lot of strategical decisions beforehand.  Once the game runs, you cannot undo any of these.  In Dominion you make up your deck as you play which means that you have the opportunity to correct mistakes while you're playing.  As a result, Dominion is a game that can be easily learned on-the-fly.  It's so fast that you can just try one tactic, correct it while you're playing and when you fail just try the next one.  This makes it so unique and exiting: It's fast, deep and flexible.  

My initial rating was a 9.  Raised it to 10 after >10 plays.  Maybe if a killer strategy is developed I may have to lower it again but for the time being this is the game that has impressed me most since the Settlers of Catan was published.

Edit: Rating lowered to 7 after numerous plays.  

Edit: Rating raised to 8 after trying some new card combinations.

I've been an avid CCG fan for a while, and one of the important parts of most CCGs is deck-building. Dominion, in an interesting twist, makes deck-building the *game*, not the preparation. I've really enjoyed this one when it hits the table, even though my group would only play the most basic setup (without most of the interactive cards) and then killed it for lack of interactivity :( Really hated that move, among others.

It's a very fun game, that can be quick or long depending on players' actions/strategies. At one point I'll have to pick it up again (once I find a group that will play it again >< )

I love this game. My wife and I play together at least once a week. She is not a typical gamer, nor am I, but we both really enjoy this game. Playing this game has made me feel the need to purchase more strategy games, as my wife and I both have enjoyed our interactive time together. I highly recommend this game to all casual, and non-casual gamers. It is just good solid fun, with lots of strategic depth based on all the combinations of action/kingdom cards available. Losing at this game makes me want to play even more. I think about all the things I should have done, and just want to get better. Very addicting!

UPDATE (6OCT2013): Just broke this back out and taught it to my 7 year old son. It still gives me those feelings of wanting to play again and again. I think it had the same affect on my son, as he immediately asked to play again, even before the first game was over. So much fun!

RATING: 6
The idea of using deck construction as an actual gameplay mechanic is very original, but that does not mean it is very good or engaging. And the amount of reshuffling is a bit annoying. Besides, most cards are very similar, unimaginative and/or uninteresting, and the whole game is basically another efficiency engine. Even the medieval theme, which I usually like, feels dull and generic. The game does have some qualities, being simple, quick, well-balanced and quite strategic, with no big flaws. But it lacks tension, depth, and a sense of achievement. It is mildly fun and I will certainly play again, but I'm in no urge to do so.

RATING: 5
Fun and simple.  Easy to introduce non-gamers to.  Gets repetitive pretty quickly.  Probably needs some expansions to have any staying power.  And even then it might get old fast.

Update 4/7/12: 6 -> 7 Much improved with an expansion.

Update 12/16/12: 7 -> 5 I just don't play it anymore.  With three and four players, Dominion doesn't offer any of the types of player interaction that are why I play multiplayer games (conflict, alliances, manipulation, trading, whatever).  It's much better heads up, but if I'm going to play a two-player game there are so many better options.  Plus the overhead of dealing with and storing all the cards, and remembering to play the combos correctly as Throne Rooms and Schemes are played with duration cards just got to be a pain.  isotropic spoiled me in that regard.  

Dominion is a fairly deep game (or at least a fairly [i]wide[/i] game), and as such is something of a lifestyle game.  But it doesn't interest me enough to commit the time to be a truly excellent player.

Not really a deck builder guy, seems that there are so many other options and titles for play than just shuffling cards all the time.

Wife and little one enjoy it, so its good enough for me.

7.5 rating, could never rate a card game higher...but it works, has nice art and always seem to make the family table

This is the second of a one-two punch that got me interested in gaming again.  Dominion scratches an itch I've had ever since bowing out of Magic: The Gathering years ago without all of the nonsense of buying tons of cards and dealing with artificially inflated values of cardboard.  Now, instead of buying lots of boosters and packs I plan to buy expansions for a fraction of the cost.  

Lots of fun and generally a quick game.

RATING: 7
I give a 7 because while it is good as a base game, it needs to be expanded for long replayability. Also I am really not a fan of the art. A bit too Euro for a deck building game. Similarly, there is no story.
I understand that there doesn't need to be a story but given the lack of replayability after 30 or so games (which is a lot), then more interesting fact about the cards would be nice.

After our first 3 plays I was ready to sell this game. I found it rather boring. I did some research and realized that we were not trying to build an "engine". Once we discovered this technique, the game quickly became one of my favorites. Now I see the endless possibilities of building an engine, completely changing the cards, then doing it all over again. In our group, we come to a consensus on the deck. We do not do it random, but rather only pick cards that people want to use. Once an engine has been built with certain cards we remove them for a while to keep it from getting to samey. We talk strategy with each other as well before the game starts, and we always discuss our plays as we are making them. All of this helps us avoid a "multi-player solitaire" experience and makes the game better. I would recommend this game to anyone and my rating may increase even further over time.

Update: The more I play the more I am hooked on this game. It is still not quite my favorite game overall, but engine building is my favorite mechanic from any game that I am playing right now. I find myself continuously thinking of ways to improve my stack and make it work more effectively. Brilliant.

Update: After 10 plays I still find the game very good. No sign of tiring at all with all of the possible starting combinations, which each may require a different strategy.

RATING: 5
I would only play this with someone who is a novice at board games as a non-intimidating introductory game. Limited and fairly one dimensional and predictable in terms of strategy. While this game may have had it's heyday I have to believe that much of the basis of it's high rating is nostalgic. I have found greater enjoyment with virtually every other deckbuilding game I have played--although , of course I am selective.

The first modern tabletop game that I became truly obsessed with.  Over a thousand plays logged on isotropic and I still love it.

Theme-less but deep. Plays fast. Mechanics are extremely well designed. I prefer playing this digitally, and its a shame the best means of doing so have gone away. Playing in person is a lot of shuffling and what interaction there is is indirect - limited to tracking what the other players are doing and adjusting your strategy when appropriate.

Engaging, simple and rewarding.  Let down by poor quality cards (and aspects of the art are ugly too). A more social game than RftG and right now, a superior preference.  The card selection means that this game feels different every time.  Surely one of the best games of 2008.

RATING: 8
Well, I stand corrected. This game is not bad at all. Everything I read about Dominion made me think it would be a terrible bore. When someone finally pulled the game out, I didn't complain simply because I thought it would be rude to refuse to play something everyone else wanted to play. And frankly, I'm the type that has to try most things at least once.

During the rules explanation I alternately dozed off and considered stabbing myself in the eye. Ifrst third of the game I was honestly lost. But you know, by the time the first game ended, I had to admit that the game did not suck anywhere close to as much as I had imagined. In fact, it was really quite decent.

We played two more times and by the last time I could even say that I had a half-decent idea of how to play. Lost that one by only one point.

What I liked the most was trying to balance the need for lots of money, with getting a decent mix of action cards.

And now after several more plays, I've upgraded the game to an 8 since I have found myslef wanting to play the game more. Simple and addictive. Yet has some depth.

RATING: 6
Really quick and really fun. On those two qualities alone, I see why it's compared to Race for the Galaxy, even if the gameplay is almost entirely dissimilar. This is an economic engine building game where you eventually start cranking out points instead of money, so timing is a big issue. It's novel, unique, and did I mention quick and fun? Not the revelation some people have made it out to be, but awfully good.
This game might have a serious start-player advantage, though, almost on a par with T&E; but it's not as good as T&E.
[EDIT] I think I've burned out on this one a bit. Too much shuffling, too much reliance on one or two action cards (what's the point of so much variety if it's often best to ignore 80% of the board?), and too many interminable +draw +action turns. I prefer Thunderstone. There, I said it!

Extremely overrated game! After a few plays I knew this would become boring fast and that´s exactly what happened.

While the deck-building and scoring ideas (putting the cards into the deck, hindering only yourself) are nice, the gameplay is bland, the cards are unbalanced and the end-condition feels pasted on, like they just needed a way to end the game at one point.

Great ideas, but a bad realization, could by WAY better.

Finally had a change to play this game. All the stores here carry Dominion and pretty much everyone has played it so I expected great things. I should've have known better. All the games that gain mainstream popularity are simple - due to the fact of general public being simple - but I prefer games with complexity and challenge. The title suggested that this game has something to do with dominating other players but it's just a boring eurogame without any interaction. You collect points. That's the only goal here. To collect bloody points! Also, the cards at play always have a couple that are clearly the most beneficial for collecting those boring points which means everyone collects the same few cards and no one pays any attention to the other ones. All in all a very boring game experience. I'd suggest Mage Knight over this any day. A superior gaming experience but with quite a similar use of cards as this one.

RATING: 7.5
Let's start with the most important piece of info: Do not compare this to Race for the Galaxy! RftG has so much depth compared to this one that we could as well be talking about sandbox versus Sahara.

This is a nice light filler that you can autopilot on after making the initial assesment of available actions. This is really fun in the same sense than playing Tetris. You can easily do without it, but it's just fun slapping the cards around while talking with your friends. Only problem is the setup time against playing time ratio could be better and when playing with two the game stops during shuffles every now and then. Good, easy fun.

FINAL COMMENTS:  I have a love hate relationship with this game, which I have probably played close to 1000 times now.  As a 15 minute computer game, with all the expansions, I rate it an 8.  As a 45 minute board game, I rate it a 5.  So, I'll give a 6.5 as a compromise.  The game is great because of the multiple paths to victory, extreme variability, and long term planning required to win.  However, for many setups, just buying all the treasure cards you can (or sprinking a couple actions) is better than an action based strategy, which is a little frustrating.  Additionally, you spend FAR more time shuffling and waiting than you do thinking.  How to play your hand is mindless and decision-free usually.  The only choices are the strategic buying choices, which as severely constrained by is this better than a similarly costed treasure card?  The answer is almost always no. 

A great game, but not something I will ever play in person unless asked to.

What follows are my older comments about the game that I will leave here for historical value:

Hugely overrated.  The "popcorn" of gaming.  A fun game desperately in need of more theme and more ways to interact with the other players so it doesn't feel like an optimization exercise with a couple interactive cards as speed bumps.  For the playtime, its great.  The downtime is minimal and the decisions can be engaging regarding how you build your deck and create your VP engine. 

As a face to face game, this is a 6, because as a half hour game its vapid and interaction-free.  On BSW, its a solid 8, because its 10 minutes of efficiency engine where I can check my email on the other player's turns. 

Although the overall strategy is almost interesting, the tactical decisions are all very very simple.  Do I concentrate on drawing, or actions, buying, etc, or what?  Thats the interesting part of the game, and its really interesting.  How you build your deck/engine is a lot of fun and strategically pretty deep.  However, the actual turn to turn play is boring, repetitive, and often is just an optimization exercise.  What do I do this turn?  A monkey can do this part of the game.  Too easy, no brainpower needed.  The overall strategy has some neat choices but your hand plays itself.

I can see why people are so crazy about it, but there are some warts and I don't think its worth an higher ranking, much less the gaming-jesus status it currently has on the geek.  A functioning theme would have added a lot and not been difficult to implement.  Plus, with the ability to swap cards in and out there should have been some variants with more interaction.  Hopefully in the future this is taken care of by expansions.  

Anyone who thinks the game is original hasn't done enough CCG drafts.  Basically the same thing here. Still, for a game with no difficult decisions whatsoever and no interaction, Dominion is pretty good.

I have played it on BSW about 300 times now, and unless the expansions really ratchet up the interaction, I can only see this rating holding steady or going down.  I don't see myself buying it either.

Update:  This is catching on in person at the local game store now.  I've played a few games there.  This is a thoroughly "solvable" game where players of equal skill value will mostly win or lose based on the draw of the cards.  I think a rating of 6 is pretty generous.  Online, it is great, but in person the only reason I really play it anymore is if it is with a group of people who I like and with whom I can have fun no matter what we play.  That isn't exactly a ringing endorsement of the game.  Dominion: the Shuffling!  Probably in the top 5 of my most played games if you count BSW but also something I will never, ever buy.

Game almost plays itself once you know what you are doing...

Still the best deckbuilder imo, albeit with its flaws

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Plays fast, has a ton of variety depending on what actions are available, and considerable depth of strategy.  I imagine that with expansions the replayability of it will be endless.  The only thing I can ding it for is that the randomness can be a problem.  There's nothing more frustrating than knowing exactly what you need to do, and then having an opponent beat you by doing exactly that because they got the card draws that they needed and you didn't.

Great fun, but lost out to our good friend Thunderstone due to theme and goal orientation. Building an engine is fun, but it just feels better to kill a monster. Although, if you're feeling the purist mindset itch, dominion scratches it perfectly.

I've had almost as much fun redesigning my one-box storage solution for this game as I have actually playing it. The odd thing is that that speaks well for the game. Lots of replayability here and fun card combos keep me coming back for more, even if only at great intervals. 

It's also provided me with a passion for following the explosion of deck-building games. I'm interested in seeing how this is applied to other designs. Most of what has followed is clearly dreck, but there are a few exceptions.

The most innovative game to come along in the last few years. As a CCG player, the combos and deck building really appeal to me, and it seems simple enough for most anyone to pick it up. I love that all the resources in the game, gold, points, cards, actions, buys, etc. are so important; it makes your choices very interesting. I was worried it would be a ton of shuffling, but this was rarely a factor as most shuffling happens in downtime between turns, and small deck sizes means it doesn't take long anyway. Main drawback is the limit of 4 players. I really can't see why you couldn't have more.

RATING: 10
Rating (8) after ~20 plays, all on BSW: I'm past the stage where I think the game is cool because of its uniqueness.  I'm not yet to the point where I understand the subtle player interaction and manipulation of game pace necessary to be really good at the game.  If indeed the game gets there then I'll bump my rating up.
2/4/09: Ok this goes all the way to 11, but BGG will only let me give it a 10.
5/20/09: Several hundred plays later, this tops out at a 9.  Luck plays too large of a role for it to be a 10.  In many setups the outcome is largely determined by who sees their action cards first and it what combination.
5/6/11: Hmm... haven't updated this in awhile.  This game is clearly a 10 in my book.

RATING: 8.5
After just one play, I immediately liked this game (other than puzzling through the confusing rules).  Just ignore the phrase "but the player must do as much as he can" during the playing of an Action card.  Things like +1 Card or "trash this card" are mandatory, but +1 Action and +1 Buy don't mean that those actions have to be taken immediately -- it means that they get added to the allowed limit of Actions and Buys, which a player is never forced to take.  (You don't have to play any Actions or Buy any cards at all, even if you have the cards in hand to do so.)

This game has so much replayability because even if you follow the same strategy, you are drawing different cards out of your deck.  It's also much more enjoyable than a CCG because you don't need to buy more decks of cards.  But then again, each new expansion costs like $30, so this game has a certain collectible/novelty cost...

The key decisions in the game are about what mixture of cards to acquire -- early on, you probably need to get some actions that let you draw more cards (like the Smithy), then you need to buy silver and gold Treasure cards (to allow you to buy bigger point cards).  Buying multiple Market cards to chain together is a good strategy, as is the Cellar for the later game when you have many point cards you want to discard.  The Village (+1 card, +2 actions) is a great action multiplier card.

Building an efficient deck is an important key to Dominion, and nothing emphasizes that like the Chapel strategy -- trash cards that slow you down (like your entire original deck of Estates and Copper), and replace them with bigger money or Action cards that you can use every turn.

One simple strategy is to buy only Silver and Gold cards (no Actions) until you can afford Provinces, then buy Provinces (and near the end of the game, maybe Duchies).  This is a good baseline strategy to try to beat -- just because you think you have a strategy that works, it may be too slow to beat the simple Big Money strategy (perhaps augmented by a card or two like Smithy).

Also misunderstood in that people seem to go through several different skill phases / plateaus, and at times think they have "solved" the game (when in reality it is their opponents fault for letting them use the same strategy every time without seeing / using the counters).

A lot of fun with high replayability. Playing a game makes you want to play again. Trying certain strategies makes you want try other card combinations. 

Game's greatest strength is how quickly/easily it can be played and its broad appeal.

Its weakness for me is that the more I play, the more mathematical (and the less imaginative) it becomes. Perhaps adding the expansions would make me rate it higher.

One of my favorite games.  Great replayability with the card combos.  The game gets exponentially better with the additional expansions which keeps things fresh game after game.  This game is a great breakthrough in deck-building games for ex-Magic gamers who got sick of having to buy new expansions.

Sure, it's not the most complex game, but that's what I like most about it. I love the simplicity, and that it's so streamlined. There's practically no downtime, as the decisions are fairly basic, and yet amazingly meaningful. Looking for good card combos and making the right decision at exactly the right time will almost always win you the game, making it very satisfying.

RATING: 6
I have to admit that when I read everywhere how this game has deck building mechanics, I expected a bit more in the actual deck building departement. I'd rather call it "engine building with a fixed set of cards", since deck building proper would imply more than a choice of ten cards to build your deck from - but that's just my interpretation.

Of course, only having to choose from, read and learn 10 cards per game makes this game easier to grasp, and the cards easier to balance.

The game is very neat. Quite simple mechanics overall, maybe lots of shuffling, but the clear distinction between the action and the buying phase (while not that easy to grasp for newbies) makes things very clear, rules-wise, and interpretative errors of card's powers rare.

A notable mention to the inlay. It's great.

Nevertheless, this is for trade. It just doesn't see enough table time, and I'd rather play other games, too.

I can see why this game is so popular. But it's a strange one. Because the pace is so fast it put me in a mental zone that made me feel like the cards were playing me...like I was a neutral medium for all these cards moving quickly around the table. I felt immersed and detached at the same time. I can imagine playing one game after another and then suddenly realizing that hours have passed, my eyes are blurry, and the sun is rising.

I really loved Dominion the first few times I played it, than it wore off quickly.  Now I can fuel my interest by buying expansions, but the time played/money ratio is not attractive; worst, I do not really want to play again with the cards I already own, because it feels samey and there is no meaningfull interaction.
Finally, there is no theme to speak off.  Bleh.  Meh.

I understand that this game is a pure mechanic game which established deck-building. While I appreciate this mechanic, I am less keen on the fact that the meta-game is almost more important than the game itself. By this I mean that while the cards in play are random, good/great players already know (for the most part) the optimal strategy for the arrangement. Expansions temporarily 'fix' this by injecting new blood into the stream but that is not a type of solution that I am interested in (or have room for).

RATING: 6
Good card game, but for me the spatial interaction element of a game board is such a big part of the gaming experience. Not a bad game, but games with cards only will never be among my favorites. 

Replay value is extremely high, given all the different card types and combinations.

Oh how I felt let down. I played it, I was wowed by the clever mechanics, I bought it. 10 games later I realised there was no laughing, no swearing and hardly any thinking. The long winded turns by some players were the final. 
Ironically the next offering by this designer was quite the reverse. I thought Kingdom Builder looked a bit of a flimsy game at first but have since seen it for what it is. A crisp abstract that offers a versatile playing experience every time.

This game is all about combos and drawing the cards that will allow you to make the best combos. The theme is nonexistent, which is normally a problem for us, but because it plays so smoothly and allows for so much replayability, we can get over it. I see some expansions in our near future.

Undoubtedly a brilliant design, but I played Thunderstone first and I think I like it more. The constant card drawing and deck manipulation make this slightly less fun to me, and of course the theme makes some difference. Still, Dominion is very good. I could see this moving up to an 8.

I wish I liked this game more as it was my first deckbuilding game and seems to have done so much for the genre but it just doesn't age that well. Maybe my play group is too varying in experience, but it seems too easy for a deck to "go infinite" or for a player to pull so far ahead there's no point in continuing.

I love games that are different with each play, and this one has that in spades.  Very simple rules to teach, speedy play times.

10 -> 7.5 Many plays later I'm kind of burned out on it.  The money strategy is no fun to play against and it kind of ruined the game for me.

Hopefully the expansion will help this regain some of the former glory.

A game that really sucks you in! The first few turns are dull, all you're doing is buying cards you can't even use yet - and I could really see from the look on my girlfriends face, she was bored.

Really like this game.  Love that it has good amount of replay/change in the base box, although I wish I had gone ahead and bought a couple of expansions right away.  That said, I have yet to play my copy as the people that I play with have all the expansions so I don't need to bring it.

Need to see if my old gaming group down in VA has played and introduce it to them if not.

RATING: 8.5
The Dominion series is definitely a favorite of my family and I.  We currently own 5 expansions in addition to the base game.  If I include the expansions with the base game when considering a rating, it would definitely be a “10”, but since I am rating the base game itself, I am being a little more reserved with the rating.  Hence, this is why it is one of our favorites (with the expansions), yet “only” receives an 8.5 rating.

For those of you new to Dominion, the game consists of a plethora of cards and *only* cards.  I mention this, as I remember being slightly disappointed when I opened the box and saw no other components (other than the cards).  This was my first introduction to a game like this, and I wondered how fun a card-only game would be.  Well, I discovered it can be a blast!

The cards are unique and divided into three main categories (action, treasure, and victory).  It is quite fun building up your “dominion” and trying to decide if you should use an attack card to punish your opponents, or if you should use a card to aid in the purchasing of other cards to aid in the building process (whether it be through larger treasure cards and/or through action cards that provide larger bonuses, and/or victory cards themselves).

And although there are attacks, my family and I find the attacks to be fun in nature (sure, there are those, “Oh, rats!” moments when you have to take a card you do not want or need to give up a card you were hoping to play, but we find it all fun).  And while most of the cards affect the person playing the card only, there are certainly a few that affect others (i.e. Bureaucrat, Spy, etc.) and therefore offer player interaction.

And one of the best things about Dominion is that no 2 games are the same.  There are approximately 25 action card sets (in the base game), but only 10 of these are used in any one game.  And if you use a random method of selecting which 10 to use, your games are almost guaranteed to have a different combination of 10 each time.  This could (and does) affect what strategies a player uses when playing (so you are not always doing the same thing / playing the same cards each game).

Overall, Dominion is an excellent game to play with family and friends.  We play with 3 players 95% of the time and 4 players the other 5%, and find both to be very enjoyable.

Good and quick game. With only the base game you probably have material to play over one thousamd games. Probably the bast value per play there is. The game cards are well designed. The play time is fast (15-30min after you have some experience with it), so you can play several times in one evening. In the first plays I didn't like it very much, but the more I played the more I liked it, because I could understand the way the various cards acted together.

The grandfather of all deck-building games.

Depending on the cards there can be limited interaction between players..
First time i played this, i played against a human computer who prolonged the game even though he owned everyone at the table.. with his endless turns taking several minutes to finish.. everyone else was just trying to kill the game by emptying those 3 piles.. luckily i gave it another go with normal people, and that was pleasant.

3 player is good, 4 player not so because of the pretty long downtime.

I enjoy Star Realms better because it's easier, has more conflict & less downtime. But with 3 dominion is the game to go.

A classic. Nothing more to say. Theme may not appeal to everybody, but the mechanics are (mostly) fluid and great fun to play with even unexperienced friends. But it has a kind of a learning curve. Once you've mastered the game, know all the cards and strategies it will be not very entertaining to play with you for an beginner. So better be anxious about your friend (if you wanna keep him/her as friend ;)).

-Very good replayability.

-Short gameplay so can be played numerous times.

-Too much shuffling which can be boring after a while.

I don't like Dominion that much. I've played it few times and each time the game has not been fun for me to play. I like some other deck builders so it isn't that.

RATING: 4.2
Dominion is the Granddaddy of the Deck Builders, and is the entry point into a Renaissance of new board games. I am proud of its achievement.

Yet still, the game has its flaws. The victory point cards you receive make the game less fun, but the goal of the game is to make the game less fun. The game does not put you into a unique situation as a player, so you could basically just do the exact same thing other players are doing. And lastly, it sucks that you can do a simple gold buy tactic. And the art kinda sucks.

6-8-10
After trying this with other people and each combination of 2P, 3P, and 4P, this game is excellent.  It has the elegant Euro feel but with very little downtime and a quick pace.  There is a good amount of thinking to be done in regards to card selection and deck balancing but at the same time, it's very easy to understand how you get points and put together strategies.

It's pretty easy to teach - once the player understands the basics of how a turn works, how the game ends, and how to win, it's a matter of figuring out what the 10 Kingdom cards do and going from there.  Each game can be quite different with a multitude of strategies to try out which should keep the longevity high.  With multiple expansions to add, I see this one coming to my game group pretty much every time.

There really aren't any downsides here.  Quick play means even a bad game will end sooner than most other Euros of this depth - if you're behind and you know it, your suffering will be over soon!  It's fast to setup and put away.  Definitely glad I bought this one.

bought at GC 09, played in Ft.

Easily the current favourite in our house and the only game my missus will actually suggest we play!

This wasn't a game I thought I'd particularly like, but I bought it on the back of the buzz surrounding it and because I was looking for a relatively fast non-collectible card game.  Everyone I've taught the game to has become an instant fan.

It's easy to teach and fast to play.  The 25 kingdom cards make for a huge amount of variety in gameplay and strategy.

I'll definitely be buying one of the big-box expansions in the near future, but don't think that we've played anywhere near enough of the base game yet.

after 5 plays: This is an interesting game with obvious depth coming from the random or provided sets of 10 action cards.  The game seems to be a tactical game, making the most of each move, but it isn't.  It's deely strategic, and relies on probability in a major way.  You ivest in yoru future, but you may not see what you expect due to chance.

After much (deliberate) avoidance, I was finally acquainted with this game, and I now know better why this fairly quick and somewhat addictive game is rated so highly by so many.

I had two plays last night with a good friend, which we actually split 1:1.  The game is a different kind of card management game than RftG, requiring some ability to organize and utilize one's cards in any order- it reminds me far more of MtG in that sense.

But one still builds engines, and accumulates VP in hand, and the deck with (3) Laboratories, (1) Library, (1) Cellar and (1) Spy I had 2nd game was able to cycle through all but one or two cards in almost any shuffle, and I obtained all of the last 4 Provinces, after being down 4 to 2.

An interesting, and potentially addictive game- I will start this at a 7, based on my (2) plays.

NOTE: I have good reason to believe that Santa has selected this for my stocking this year, IF I am a good geek.

Dominion left me cold. it's basically buy cards so you can buy more cards to draw more cards that help you to buy even more cards. the person who somehow best sees the greatest combination of cards that are available will probably win, which is actually a good sign because that means that skill is important, but there is a lot of story missing from the game.

Not bad, but Race has raised the bar as to what one can expect from a 20-min card game. Prediction: like St. Pete, its lack of depth means that its metaphoric rise will merely be a temporary one. Awesome gateway game though.

Edit: It looks like my prediction is way off (although it is accurate for me--I have lowered the rating from a 7 to a 6 as I just don't want to play it as much anymore). That said, it seems to me that the group of players who like Dominion (say significantly more than Race) also tend to like games that are lighter than what I usually enjoy.

Edit: I continue to want to play this less and less, so it's a 5 now.

The collectable card game where you don't have to spend your life and money collecting cards.  Instead you spend it on expansions, sleeving and sorting.... Wait a minute!

So, really, its a deck building CCG where everyone has equal opportunity to build a deck.  And there is nothing wrong with that.  There are some over powered cards/combos but since your deck only last 30 minutes and everyone has equal access, its not a biggy. 

Too much reading needed for my kindergartener, but I bet he'll like it in 3-4 years.

Dominion is an amazing game. I think it becomes even better with more plays, and is very easy to teach. Tweaking which starting 10 cards to use is a game in and of itself, trying to figure out which will result in the best game. I highly recommend Dominion.

I've played this a lot and I still want to play more. Now that is a sign of a good game. And Dominion really is a great game. It's fast but still has deep in it. And you can teach it to any one and I bet they like it. Only tiny complain for me is the shuffling, which there is a lot. Especially if you build your deck so that you go through it every turn. Then you shuffle a lot. Though it's not bugging me so much that it would ruin the enjoyment of the game for me.

Some day I own the expansions...

RATING: 7
Simple mechanics, fast play, furious competition, many different strategies, seemingly infinite replayability. The fun of assembling a deck a la Magic, with the slugfest feel of Colossus: Arena, and the multiple paths to victory like Puerto Rico. It's definitely a winner! Initial rating: '8'.

Now, if only it could accommodate 5 or 6 players, this would be outstanding...  but I see there is a variant! After 20+ plays, I can see where one could start to burn out or start to play on autopilot...

Update: Game takes 45-60 minutes for newbies, especially if one of them has AP. Could ruin the experience for everyone else if not corrected immediately.

Update: it is possible to teach a 10-yr old, who has some CCG experience, but there may be a bit too much downtime and not enough player interaction that they lose attention quickly.

Update: After 50+ plays, I am bumping this up to a '10'. I'm addicted. So are my gaming buddies.

Update: tried to teach this to non-gamers on New Year's Eve, with a crowd of people talking around us, and with kids running around. Thought I was going to lose them, since they were confused and thought the game was ultra complex, and it took longer than an hour to finish (they had played and liked Settlers the previous year). We ended up playing 10 times through the next day! I'm not sure if this is a good 'gateway' game since if they have never heard of Magic, or any modern boardgame, then there is no context, other than "It's a really convoluted game of Uno!"

Update: after 80+ F2F plays, this is still a favorite in my gaming circles. As some of us are familiar with all the cards, we get the newbies into the 'random' mode after only one or two 'basic' card setup games, and don't bother with the other setups. This keeps everything fresh for the veterans. Strategies are quickly discovered, and just as quickly circumvented by another subtle strategy. I am really beginning to appreciate the subtle sophistication of this seemingly simple little game.  

Update (2/3/09): 120 F2F plays. Have consistently played this on every game night, save one. Our group now plays 'rounds' of 3 or 4 games, depending on the number of players, which equals 2 hours where we could have been playing something else. This game continues to rock. Although I've seen comments on the thin, pasted on, generic theme, and the lack of interaction, it still works. Each of us have become enamored with certain cards. We 'bitch' and 'curse' when the Witch comes out, moan when the Thief steals our gold or shout with glee when someone else has theirs stolen, and feel a smug sort of satisfaction when we trash 3 estates and a copper with the Chapel. There's plenty of cursing and trash-talking, which makes for humorous and memorable gameplay. We still talk about the most memorable one as the time the Thief stole everybody's money, and we experienced first-hand what a deflationary economy feels like.

Update (03/08/09): 149 F2F Plays. I've lost the last ten or so straight games... what is going on here? It seems everyones' playing skill has bumped up a notch? The game again is becoming a puzzle/challenge to decode, now that everyone is caught up.

Update (03/19/09): 154 F2F Plays. I'm still on a losing streak. Somehow, the standard plays don't work as well as they used to. I'm waiting eagerly on the promo cards and the expansion.

Update (04/10/09): After a hiatus of three weeks, the promo cards showed up! Played three games with both, where they added interesting dynamics. Black Market is like a drug, which is useful early in the game to get 'special' cards, but can be a distraction. Envoy is not as powerful as Council Room, because the opponent will choose your single gold or action card, and make your draw worthless. However, with Throne Room, could get you eight juicy cards to get you that Province.

Update (04/26/09): 161 F2F plays. Okay, I admit it--the game is starting to get boring--the novelty is wearing off. It doesn't hit the table as much as used to. If we have 30-45 minutes to kill, then this fits the bill. The consensus is that the Envoy is generally useless. The Black Market is a pain-in-the-ass for me to setup and take down. Now, I just outlaw the card altogether, because I don't want to deal with another 10 minutes putting the cards away.

Update (05/23/09): 169 F2F plays. Envoy is now considered useful if coupled with Throne Room and/or Village, otherwise, it is useless. We now use the leftover "blue-back" template cards for the Black Market. This speeds up setup immensely, although we now know when a "special" card is popping up. No matter. Also, Dominion is not as portable as once thought. 500 cards in sleeves is pretty bulky and heavy. They will fit in 5x sleeve tuck boxes, but still it is of considerable density.

Update (05/25/09): 170 F2F plays. Envoy coupled with Festival/Village is devastating in the later game. Early on, it seems trivial to dismiss a silver or gold treasure card, but later on it becomes a nightmare if Envoy is played off of a Village or Festival, and another Village or Festival (or Council Room for that matter) pops up along with a Gold or two.

Update (06/14/09): 172 F2F plays. Have played with the heavy-duty Ultra Pros card sleeves since the beginning, which were slightly oversized. Today, played with penny-sleeves that were the new "Euro" size. Don't bother with cheap penny-sleeves. Get the thicker, more durable plastic. It is worth it in terms of durability, but more so in the feel of the cards, as well as shuffle-ability.

Update (08/15/09): 177 F2F plays. Hadn't played it in nearly two months because the Euro-sleeves took that long to arrive in the mail from Mayday Games. Still hasn't lost that 'touch' in terms of speed, fun, and interaction. Now, need to sleeve Intrigue and get Dominion back in circulation.

Update (06/18/10): Haven't played it in awhile. With the original box holding both the base and Intrigue cards sleeved, makes for a heavy weight to carry around. It takes too much time to set up and put away for a filler 30-minute game, which is what this game has devolved to. No one wants to play this as the "main course" like we used to back in the beginning. With Seafarer, I am done with this game crack. Downing to "7".

Update (02/10/13) 186 F2F plays: Haven't played this in nearly two years. We brought it out briefly back then, and it still had that "magic" that only deck-building can bring. That said, Dominion is a significant milestone in board gaming evolution. As important as Settlers of Catan, it has its place in history. No other game has brought so much gaming pleasure (186+ plays), for so little money. If there were an equivalent "life time achievement award" for board gaming, this design deserves it a thousand-fold.

Update (01/02/2015) 189 F2F plays of base, 232 F2F plays if including expansions. Another two-year hiatus, broke it out for a late night romp, and it is still fun and amusing every now and then.

RATING: 8
A mechanical kick in the pants.  Draft cards to build an efficiency engine to hit the magical 8+ coins per hand and then start buying the big victory points... the rub being that once you start buying VPs they will clog up your machine and make it run all choppy.

Other than committing to a strategy the game really comes down to timing the switch from deck building to buying VPs.  Come in too soon and you bloat the machine with crap.  Come in too late and you're behind the curve and will lose, maddeningly, by something as stupid as a single card-buy.

It's fascinating to watch the different solutions grind away at the problem and to see who had the most efficient engine—and best timing—at the end.

The only knock is for the flaccid theme, which is, perhaps, thankfully thin, given how mechanical the game is and how fast it plays with experienced players.  (It's not unusual for your turn to come back around before you're done shuffling from the last one.)  A narrative layer would probably just slow everything down.

That said, I like to think of it as scratch-building a Ferrari and then seeing how much cocaine I can hide in the gas tank while still getting it across the border.  And then maybe something about fire-breathing pimps.

Or this:

I do love this game, especially the "themed" games with pre-picked cards to use as your 10 stock. But after you figure out how to win those, then you have to do random, and that's super boring... it always comes down to getting as much money as you can and converting it to land.

Not bad. I'd hate to see it get out of control with too many expansions, but it's a nice concept - the out of the box CCG - kind of like playing a blind booster contest at a con. There's also a touch of the 'solo multiplayer' about it depending on your Kingdom cards, but it plays quickly, which means you're not bored in downtime. Ha, it got out of control all right (3 years on). I've not really tried to keep up. Also, having it on the iphone means my plays are in the hundreds, but it was nice to get the box of cards out again in my most recent play.

I finally got a chance to play this with 3 friends.  It was our first encounter with a deck building game.  We all liked it.  I will say that this game is easy to learn and I will certainly introduce it to my 11 and 13 yr old.  they may struggle with the underlying strategy but that is always a learning curve.    The concept and rules are very simple and the base game is nicely accompanied by several optional deck sets.  You play with 10 'sets' of cards, each set has different actions.  Each turn you can buy a card from the set, buy more money, or buy territory.  you start with very few cards (money, territory) in your hand and every turn you can buy more.  Eventually, you have good sized deck to play so it becomes a balance of buying the correct type of card(s).  The player with the most territory wins.  Very good game.

Not my favorite game, because often it feels like it plays itself. There is little to playing your hand, so most of the game revolves around the cards you purchase. Once you get some experience, some of the purchase decisions become automatic too. It might be surprising, but short as it is, I find Dominion too long for the number of important decisions you make. Usually it comes down to a subtle choice of the timing of starting to collect victory point cards. 

The game is almost entirely strategy and no tactics, and I prefer games with a more even balance between the two. I periodically rediscover it by playing online on goko, which largely takes care of the length issue. 

A good engine building game, just not something I enjoy putting on the table or spending lots of time playing.

If you like deck-building games (and I do), this will probably be up your alley. However, I feel like you need the expansions to increase the replay factor (the base set gets a little old after awhile), but that is often the case with expansion-based games. Very easy to play 5-6 matches in a row. I've played this too many times in my gaming career to get very excited about playing it anymore though.

빠른 게임 전개, 그리고 리플레이성, 다양한 왕국카드가 게임의 재미요소를 높여주지만, 
어느 정도 플레이에 익숙해지면, 빠른 덱 회전, 액션 횟수의 증가와 드로우 중시의 전략으로 고정되게 됩니다. 결국 모두가 비슷한 덱을 구성하게 되고, 그걸 가장 먼저 구성하여 돌아가게 되는 사람이 이기게 되지요. 익숙한 플레이어끼리 플레이를 하게 되면 전략이 비슷해지게 됨에 따라서 게임이 한 쪽으로 편중되는 현상이 발생합니다. 다양한 카드나 혹은 룰의 변화가 요구되지 않는 한 이 게임은 여기서 더 이상 진보할 수 없을 것이라고 생각됩니다. 물론 모든 게임이 진보할 필요는 없고, 꼭 확장이나 추가판이 있어야만 재미있는 게임이 되는 것은 아닙니다만, 다양한 카드를 사용하게 해놓은 게임이 종국에는 한 쪽 전략으로만 쏠리게 되는 현상은 결코 좋은 게임이라고 생각되지 않는군요. 

하지만 빠른 게임 전개와 쉬운 룰, 그리고 2-4 인 이내에서는 인원 수에 관계없이 즐길 수 있다는 점은 훌륭합니다. 10 점 만점이라면 7 점 정도입니다.

As far as I know this is the first deck builder.  I bought it at steel city because it was the only board game there.  I looked at it, went to the bathroom and looked it up and read a bunch of unusually high praise for it so I went back out and bought it and have been taking it to board game nights ever since.

One of the best games ever made when it first came out, but there are much better games out n.w! Excellent as 2-player or multiplayer. Fast games (20-30 minutes on average) with little downtime between turns. Deck building genre has run its course.  Game requires constant reshuffling of your deck which takes up most of the downtime. A decent amount of player-player interaction that can thwart your plans at any given moment. Random card selection ensures that no two games are exactly alike.

No voy a descubrirle a estas alturas el Dominion a nadie, así que pasaré de hablar de sus bondades e iré directamente a los puntos débiles:

- Algunas cartas no se usan apenas. No todas son igual de valiosas y hay juegos en los que 3 ó 4 de ellas se quedan sin 
estrenar.

- El que sale tiene ventaja. Entre jugadores experimentados, esta pequeña diferencia en el orden de los turnos puede resultar decisiva. No es definitiva, pero salir da un plus.

Por demás, mucha tensión y diversión.

A very cool mechanic that unfortunately leads to a whole lot of shuffling.  The variety of Kingdom cards you're given gives it very replayable, with different combinations making it into a very different game.  That said, some of those games are better than others. 

Once you add in expansions, the variety of games you can play just explodes.  Dark Ages is probably my favorite, but I'm also a great fan of Prosperity, Seaside, and Adventures.

I found this fiddly & repetitive.  The theme & victory condition bored me.  I played it a fair few times to give it a fair chance but now it kind of makes me sick when I think about it & the time I wasted playing it.

This was yet another reminder to not believe the hype & try to do some research first.

RATING: 6.5
Solid deck builder, albeit quite basic in relation to many other deck-builders such as Legendary Aliens, Xenoshyft, Shadowrun Crossfire etc. But because of that it is very easy to teach, and makes a great gateway for the more complex deck-building games out there, since they all share similarities from Dominion.

For me, I feel the base is just too "basic" and grabbing a set of dominion base cards with Seaside and Prosperity. They seem to be the most well received of the many expansions for Dominion and don't look like they add unnecessary complexity. Overall a great game that is now 8 years old and still can be fun by its own merit. For me, I'd love to expand on it and see it truly shine.

This is my favorite game.  Best with 2 or 3 players, 4 or more is too much down time.  It is quick to play, can get 2-3 games in, in an hour.  The game and strategy is different every time, with the assortment of many different cards.  It is easy to learn, and great for newer and older gamers.   It is one of those games that even if you don’t win it is still fun.

This one I'll have to try a few more times to see if it grows better or worse over time.  This could be my repetitive card game that RftG was for other people.

UPDATE:  After a few plays, I think this game is still decent.  I dislike that I don't feel live I shuffled enough (ever), and I think there are a couple patterns to victory that are stronger than others.  This makes a lot of fluff in the selection, and I don't like that.

RATING: 8
A deck building game where players acquire new cards from a common shop. There are 10 "kingdom cards" in the shop that are randomized each game.

The only things worth victory points are the cards with a victory point symbol--most which do absolutely nothing during the game. Usually the game's rhythm is building an engine and then at a certain point, switch to buying as many victory point cards as you can.

There are many expansions, each themed around something (ie: Prosperity adds various treasure cards, Dark Ages cards encouraging trashing your own cards, etc). The vanilla set is fairly bland; I would recommend adding either Prosperity, Sea Side, or Empires to your collection when you are ready for more variety/options.

The core mechanic and flow of game play is fantastic. Most times you've barely drawn your new hand when it's your turn again. However, without the variety offered in the expansions, games can become very scripted, with everyone pursuing the one obvious strategy that the card selection suggests.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A card game about getting cards. The mechanisms are refreshingly original (in the context of Eurogames at any rate) if a little repetitive. The skill lies in knowing the good combos and timing the game such that you can make the switch from buying coins and actions to buying VPs. I have some concerns that recursive drawing is so powerful that once cards like Laboratory are on the table other strategies don't have enough time to be competitive. Card designs are much less attractive then those in Race for the Galaxy, but sets are more expensive, bad news for regular players as the constant shuffling creates a lot of wear on the cards. These days I'll only play the base set to teach the game to newcomers, Chapel, Gardens, Laboratory, Thief & Witch are the most interesting cards and lead to divergent strategies, but the expansions (especially Dark Ages, Hinterlands, Prosperity) are much better overall.

[b]EASILY ONE OF THE BEST GAMES OUT THERE, INCREIDIBLY VERSATILE AND FAST, EASY TO LEARN, IMPOSSIBLE TO MASTER[/b]

Dominion strucks everyone at first as a reinvention of the Magic: The Gathering phenomenon: A collectible card game (CCG) that is not actually a CCG. But still, it appears as if the most MTG-hating geeks (Most of them former players of Richard Garfield’s opus maxima, by the way) think the idea behind Dominion is the very same of MTG and its marketing strategies. Granted, Dominion has a lot of expansions, all of them released in a very short time span (Maybe 2 or 3 years), but not having the expansions does not mean Dominion is not an amazing game all by itself.

As I mentioned on my profile, I’m a huge fan of empire building games, and at first I was too sceptic about the claims of some about Dominion being a game that “allows you to build your own kingdom”. Unless it was played on a cardboard piece with lost of miniatures or finely illustrated bits, I was neither buying that claim nor game. But after getting the game (Mostly because it had just won the Spiel des Jahres award and because I’m a consumer wh*re) and actually playing it, I came completely around and discovered an awesome game, elegant, simple and profoundly strategic and tactical.

It would be now worth mentioning that the author of Dominion (Mr. Donald X. Vaccarino) is a retired Magic: The Gathering player, so the similarities between these tow games are obvious, but Dominion takes the whole card game ethos one step further, by allowing the possibility of not being a huge stupid bully against your opponents and actually allowing everyone to play as they want, without even deeming important whatever the other players do on their turn. Kudos for all that, Donald, old chap.

Also, it’s not-worthy the fact that because it is a board game, once opened and started, both players are pretty much on the same level of chances of winning the game, and experience playing Dominion, though useful, may not be all that matters when playing this game.

[b][i]II. Sliders[/i][/b]

Abstract [b]____[COLOR=#FF0000][5][/COLOR]_____[/b] Themed: One thing about Dominion is to consider that actions are not always related to the name of the card that grants said actions, but only on the more “story-ish” side of the game. Another fact to consider is that there are at least two other home-made versions of the game, both keeping the core mechanics intact but dramatically changing the setting and theme of the game. However, if it had been a sci-fi themed game, I’m pretty sure I wouldn’t have even tried it in the first place, so it’s safe to deduce that the them Dominion sports is most relevant to me.

Simple [b]__[COLOR=#FF0000][3][/COLOR]_______[/b] Complex: Learning the game is easy, especially because most of the rules and effects of each different action are explained in the cards themselves. The level of complexity is always established at the card selection phase of the setup, so It’s just a matter of taste of the players.

Strategic [b]_____[COLOR=#FF0000][5][/COLOR]_____[/b] Tactical: Dominion is one of those games where strategic and tactical thinking are one in the same. Will you go with the most expensive cards, the most cheap ones? Will you play the card which gives you more actions, money or buys? 
 
Luck [b]_______[COLOR=#FF0000][8][/COLOR]__[/b] Skill: Considering the fact that the decks built in each game comprise the cards each and every individual players want, the luck factor would only be present when drawing a new card, which, if drawn from a deck carefully built and protected, could very well work just as good in every situation. “The luck of the draw” expression could be used here, but for one reason or the other, luck is what one makes it In Dominion.

Fiddly [b]________[COLOR=#FF0000][9][/COLOR]_[/b] Elegant: There are of course certain things in the game that must be consulted with the game rulebook, but usually, they’re just nuisance and do very little to either solve the problem in question (because it is not that important) or usually, the answer just pops in front of you after reading for a minute or two.
 
Indirect interaction [b]____[COLOR=#FF0000][5][/COLOR]_____[/b] Direct interaction: It’s up to the players, but the interaction idea of Dominion not always involves blocking or crippling your opponents. If desired, a completely peaceful, individualistic efficiency-driven deck can be built, or maybe the players will prefer a bit of interaction.

Cutthroat [b]____[COLOR=#FF0000][5][/COLOR]_____[/b] Friendly: STUPID MILITIA CARD! OH YEAH, AND NOW YOU PLAY COUNCIL ROOM? DAMN YOOOOOOUUU and thanks for the extra card!

Heavy use of language [b]_______[COLOR=#FF0000][7][/COLOR]___[/b] No language needed: Dominion has around 5 to 6 key concepts needed to understand and play it. Once these concepts are understood, things should flow smoothly, but of course, sometimes asking those that understand those concepts or the language they’re written in is necessary.

Love the idea of building your own deck as part of a game but it doesn't work that well as the sole focus of a game. It was quite addictive at first but I don't think it holds up well to repeat plays because each turn is actually pretty boring. It doesn't have close to the same depth or variety as RftG.

Still, easy enough to be a good family game and I'm happy to play once in a while.

Best played with equal turns and "phantom" provinces.

RATING: 8
The quickness, addictiveness and variability of this game are really its selling points. My thoughts:

I'm pretty positively inclined toward this one.  I was a light CCGer for a while there and this is one psuedo-CCG that actually captures the deck-building part of such games as well as the gameplay.  Plus, it's just really fun to see the engine work. And I've always gotten a lot of enjoyment out of a nice combo play.

I wouldn't argue that it is in any way a deep game, however. It's kind of a junk food gaming experience. Why yes, I would like to eat that stick of cotton candy, but I can't really expect to derive any nourishment from it.

UPDATE:  It's a little embarrassing to raise the rating of a game whose entire point is that you can play quickly to an 8, but this is pretty addictive.  I don't understand why everyone else likes it so much, though.

Ever since I got into gaming, I've heard people talk about this game. This game, they say, was revolutionary to the hobby. This game introduces a new mechanic that every other game wanted to copy. And when I first looked it up to validate all this hype, I thought, "...blah." It just didn't look that good. The artwork seemed so boring at first. So, I passed it up. Until....

When I finally played it...I now understand the hype. This game is wonderful! It is so simple, yet with enough depth and replayability I had to have it! This is the KING of deck-builders. You need to efficiently manage the building of a deck in a frantic race to get the most victory points. The base game comes with different sample game set ups that are really fun. From decks that produce a lot of money, to others that attack other players, these set ups help learn all the different aspects of the game.
Though the theme is definitely pasted on, because I never really felt that I was building a 'dominion.' And the artwork, though at first glance I didn't care for it, has actually grown on me. I like it even. This game is a slam dunk.

Quite a light game, although some card interactions are complex enough that non-gamers may dislike it. Plays quickly, and a good bit of variety from the different decks - although I suspect that replayability will fade once dominant strategies for card combos become apparent. Dislike the way that the game ends as soon as the provinces are gone. I feel the round should be played out, and spare provinces should be available to buy during that round.

Initially an 8 for base Dominion alone. Adding in Intrigue bumped it up to a 9 for me. This game system is just so addicting, and there's so much depth to it. It took me 4 or 5 games before I really began to appreciate just how good Dominion is, but now I can't get enough of it.  

It's like giving a bunch of mechanics a pile of odds and ends car parts and challenging them each to build the best functioning car they can with the same pieces available. It's like giving a bunch of chefs the same random ingredients and having them compete to prepare a better dish than the others. Everyone uses the same cards, but tries different strategies and combos with them, which makes the game endlessly fun and interesting. It's different every time.

En síntesis, Dominion es un juego en el que hay dispuestas 10 cartas en una zona común y cada jugador, en un solitario paralelo al de los demás, debe desentrañar cuál es modo más rápido de lograr la victoria a base de adquirir y jugar cartas de acciones, tesoro y victoria. Cada jugador forma su propio mazo del que robará y descartará cartas, a base de comprar cartas de entre las 10 del "mercado" común.

Las cartas de tesoro sirven para comprar cualquiera de las tres clases de cartas y hay de tres valores distintos (1,2,y 3 monedas).

Las cartas de Victoria no sirven más que para conseguir PV´s al acabar la partida. Tres valores distintos con tres precios distintos que "estorban" en la mano, pero que son necesarias para ganar.

Las cartas de acción (color gris) permiten mejorar el mazo, hacer más acciones, compras o conseguir más dinero de lo habitual.

Parece juego de cartas para jugadores de Magic con síndrome de abstinencia. Depende de la suerte. Ejemplo: si te tocan 8-8-8 monedas puedes conseguir 18 PV's; si te tocan 10-7-7 sólo 12... un 33% menos. Los usuarios de BGG o bien por estar hartos de gestión de recursos o bien por ser ex magiqueros, lo han sobrevalorado excesivamente. Aún así le seguiré dando oportunidades.Buenísima la idea de "haz tu propio mazo y ponlo a funcionar".PROS: partidas cortas que dejan ganas de más. Más matemático de lo que pudiera parecer. CONS: Mínima interacción entre jugadores, sin tensión, sin decisiones (nada más que las evidentes). Si tienes 8 monedas, compra una provincia. Si tienes 6 compra oro. Fijo que ganas. "¿Qué ha pasado mientras barajaba? Bueno, da igual. No importa."

EDITO: en https://www.playdominion.com/Dominion/gameClient.html

Con tantas expansiones, parece útil jugar con 3 ataques + 1 carta de victoria + 6 cartas de acción. Tantos ataques, dificultan mucho la estrategia big money. La carta de  victoria extra añade más profundidad y hace obligatorio pensar estrategias distintas. Las 6 acciones, de distintas ampliaciones, mucha rejugabilidad.

There is no theme to this game, it's a bunch of cards with texts on them that tells you what you can do. I don't feel anything for this game, yet it plays quite fast and is enjoyable.

It took a couple tries, but I am starting to see the appeal of Dominion.  It is mostly solitaire, but the game moves quickly enough that you're usually not waiting around too long, and you do have to pay some attention to what others are doing.  The setup I played was pretty tame (not a lot of game-bending card powers) so I'm interested to see some of the more unusual cards and what they do to the game.

The reigning deck-builder, Dominion is probably past its prime in terms of hype but not in terms of ubiquity. Recognized immediately in most gaming circles, it is a good go-to game with a new group.

Dominion is a very light game, very easy to get into. What I really like about dominion is not the dept of every match, which are obviously shallow, but the opportunity the game offers to play multiple matches in a row so the players get to figure out the best way to build their deck for each set of cards on the spot. 

If you play Dominion occasionally, you won't like/appreciate it. It's a game that requires multiple matches for each 10 card draw so players can build and evolve from one match to another.

Enjoyable. deck building games are much better now. Haven't played it in a long time. El clásico juego de construcción de mazo (DBG). Hay un pool básico de cartas que tú puedes adquirir. Debes hacer un balace entre cartas que te permirtan tener mas dinero, cartas que te permitan multiplicar tus acciones u opciones de juego y cartas que te acumulen puntos. Solo las cartas de puntos te permiten ganar... pero esas están muertas en tu mazo cuando las adquieres... :-)

Changing how I log plays as of 7/24/13.

All plays prior to 7/24 were logged against the expansions I owned at the time of playing. I intend to start playing Dominion with 5 cards from each of 2 expansions for the foreseeable future, so all plays 7/24 and later will be against only the two expansions selected for that game.

RATING: 8
It's a deck building game! I loved it just for that, it takes me to that old times when I played Magic: the gathering. So, it's kind of scratch that itch.

It's very clever, you and all your friends start with the same thing and just buy new cards for our decks. And Victory points. It's a difficult balance to acquire.

Probably will buy an expansion, but right now it doesn't really need one.

Decent deckbuilder, but I hold the (admittedly minority opinion) that it's not the best. Fourth at the outside, by my reckoning;

- Valley of Kings is all-round better, simpler and seats more in a game.
- Star Realms is faster
- Paperback is more versatile, and hits word-game fans as well as general game fans (which makes it a marginally better gateway deckbuilder).
- Shadowrift is much deeper (if you're into cooperative games)

Given that I own all of the above, Dominion isn't likely to hit the table very often. Don't worry though; I found it a good home.

RATING: 7.5
A terrific game.  There's little to say that hasn't been said.  It's simple to learn, challenging to master, and all the expansions provide near-countless permutations of possible game setups, dozens of successful strategies, and all-around lots of fun.  It's family-friendly (my inlaws love it, and older children can play too), and has lots of subtleties.  It's a game that I'm constantly learning.

On the other hand, there is pretty much no theme to the game (perhaps aside from the Alchemy expansion), and sometimes the game can feel automatic/mechanical.  Most kingdom cards invoke very little interaction with other players, so my biggest criticism is that the game often tends toward several people playing solitaire at the same table.

Still... it's a modern-day classic that inspired a new breed of board game.

First played Feb 26th, 2009. Taught in 15min, played in 45min with 4 players. Quick game with good strategy/luck mix. Each players is given 3VPs and 7copper to start (10 cards). There are various stacks of cards which you use to accumulate more cards or VPs. It's a race to gather VPs. On your turn you draw five cards from your draw deck and are given one action and one buy per turn. Special cards allow you to have do things like draw cards from your draw deck, take extra actions, double a card, upgrade gold, discard a card(s) from the game, make people place a VP card from their hand to the top of their deck etc. You buy other cards with your gold in your hand (along with special cards). Easy to learn and a quick play. I'd recommend giving this a try and purchase consideration.

Fun deckbuilder but a bit bland.

Update: I lowered my rating from 6.5 to 6. While gameplay is interesting, it ends anti-climactic just when you get your engine going. I won, but I was reluctant to clame the final card because that would mean I would end the game just when it was starting to get fun.

I ♥ Dominion!!  I have a blast playing it.  I like that it has a shorter play time than most games, so once it's set up, it's easy to select new kingdom cards and play again and again.  In this way, you can enjoy two or three games in the time many games take to play once.  The game is interesting because there are so many kingdom cards, of which ten are selected for each game.  The fun is trying to be creative to combine the effects of the different action cards.  The player that is best able to build their deck into just the right balance of treasure cards and action cards and trash less useful cards will probably win.  Other merits:  A good level of player interaction so that your actions may affect the other players.  Short turn time-- In most games there is small down time between turns.  In games when players build wicked engines in which they play many action cards in one turn, if you didn't build your deck well, you will be waiting a long time between turns and waiting for your opponent to crush you and end the game already.  But, if you're hip to the jive and you both have big engines, the game is still extremely interesting.  I like it that even though so many cards have been released in all the expansions, many of the base game cards are among the best.  It was suggested to me to not add Alchemy to my set and I do not own Alchemy.  I would say the same thing about Dark Ages.  I agree with Tom Vasel, that Dominion plays exceptionally well with three players, but I also enjoy playing with two or four as well.

Its a pretty fast game! (depending a bit on who you playing with, lately one of us took about 5 mins to think about each turn, so one play took us more then 90 mins! Thats a bit to slow for me). Normaly it will take about 30-45 mins i gues.. 

But overall a great game!

I love this game plain and simple. I think it is fun with any number between 2-6.  And as long as people are experienced I don't think there is any lag with 5 or 6.  I have been amazed at the fun I have had playing two player matches, as usually I am not a huge two player gamer.  The expansions are good to mix it up, and attack cards or interaction cards as I call them are a must.

Oct08: I say WOW!  That was awesome.  I need more time with it.  For now, every purchase decisions was interesting, difficult, and had long term consequences.  (Except for buying the 6vps, but that's so satisfying I don't mind.)  I still struggled with how to balance my deck with just the base 10 cards.  I can't even imagine the variability with 25 cards to choose from!

The shuffling was annoying, and the actual card play was pretty obvious, but those got out of the way quickly and just let you get purchasing.  Besides, you did need to pay attention to your card play and "listen to your deck" to see what purchase is needed.

Just awesome.

Nov08: Alright, 10 plays in, I can declare it a 10.  I still might like RftG a tad bit more, but that doesn't make this a bad game by any means.

May09: And 40 plays in it has dropped from a 10.  It does many things right, but some just aren't there.  My biggest complaint is the rough edges I see.  Instant end on provinces.  Chapel power.  Very sharp income/VP splits.

Jun09: And back to a 10 with the first expansion.  No rules changes, just new cards.  But they blur the vp/income split nicely.  They also add even more interesting decisions during the play of your hand.  Yes, it slows it down a little, but that extra time is full of additional decisions so it works out nicely.  I also have switched over to the wooden chip version.  *Much* nicer.  Shuffle?  Just swap bags.

Aug16:  Haven't played in years.  Still awesome.  Expansions have gotten out of hand, and I have a pile of ~deck builders, but gotta respect this first one.  It did so much right.

While I may get burnt out on it, Dominion is still THE deck-builder. A total classic and a milestone in modern designer games. It got everything right and every game after almost always took away good design when Dominion's formula was tweaked. Criticize the dry theme all you want, but I've only seen one deck-builder, Arctic Scavengers, actually feel representative of its theme rather than feel like grabbing piles of cards.

The original deck building game. As of this writing, I still prefer it over the alternatives like Nightfall, Thunderstone, etc., if only by a narrow margin, because I think it just flows faster.

There are a few caveats, though. The art is...okay. Certainly nothing to write home about. It also completely lacks a theme. There's a story about players attempting to acquire lands in order to get a dominion of their own, but it's slapped on at best. Really all you're doing is crunching numbers. Thankfully, I feel the fun factor is enough to ignore this problem.

The biggest issue I take with this game, however, is near-zero player interactivity. You hardly ever affect the actions of other players. I hear Prosperity alleviates this somewhat, but alas, I don't own it, so I couldn't say.

Having said that, it's easy to learn and even people who aren't into board games seem to enjoy this, at least from my experience.

I love the mechanics of this game.  Most of the cards seem useful for straight forward strategies, allowing unfamiliar or new players multiple choices for each play-through.  This is a fun game for people who prefer a passive play style.  There are very few cards which affect other players.  I also like games that can fit into 30-45 minute time slot.  We played twice in about 70 minutes, and that included explaining the game to two new players.

Really fun game that plays well with two players and more, can sometimes have some downtime with particularly AP-prone players but the replayability factor is enormous given the number of combinations of cards that are available for use in any game.

Well worthy of the Spiel des Jahres, pick it up to see if you like it (you will) and then maybe start hunting one or two of the many expansions this game has.

Received in trade Oct 25, 2010. Looking forward to playing and commenting.

Am now in the midst of my 4th play with my primary gaming partners--my children. We are all enjoying it very much. The simplicity of the system suits the bottom of the age group, but each time through players like taking a turn because they have something useful and interesting that they can do. The younger ones enjoy the art and having a name to associate with most of the plays, and I enjoy exploring various card combinations. I imagine the game will hold up nicely for us because we can rarely get in more than a game or two a week with the kids' activities now.

12/01/12 Update
Actually stopped keeping track of plays after first six months. My guess is somewhere in the 200s face to face plays as played many nights with family on vacation where games start in the afternoon and go through til midnight, usually with multiple tables for some portion of that. Easily have 1000 plays on Droid (before I retired the ap this fall so I could get something done in my spare moments)

A fun abstract deck-building game. Visually, the game leaves much to be desired. Mechanically, the game is very satisfying.

The game is simple to teach and *can* be fairly short once players get a feel for what they're doing.

The real downsides are the games that devolve into deck-drawing (slowly drawing your entire deck into your hand every turn).

The game isn't perfect, but it's very good. I consider it one of my favorites.

a fun game that has a distinct playstyle dynamic. Though, I do get the feel that i'm often playing "group solitaire" when I play, as there's minimal interaction with other players (besides the occasional 'oooh' and 'ahhh' when someone forms a run of actions and buys).

This is the model of deck-building, and a really good game. That being said, the base game has actually become a bit stale at a quicker rate than I anticipated. If i had shelf space for the expansions, i'm sure I'd absolutely adore this game.

Great game.  CCGers will pick this up right away.  Some card combinations can make the game drag out a bit, but otherwise, lots of fun.  However, the theme is barely there, other games have come along that use the deckbuilding mechanic and add an interesting theme.  The mechanics in this are the tightest of them all, and that will appeal to some.

There is a lot more to this game than there seems at first. I was put off for a long time because of the "silver test," but once I got the game on sale for $26 and found out that my wife LOVES it, I took the time to delve deeper into it. Loads of fun and quick and easy to play. :)

RATING: 7
Classic deck-building game. For beginners, you'll likely pick cards that seem cool without realizing until 3/4 through the game how they're starting to mess you up. I like to see how some cards play off of each other and how it's advantageous to trash some cards and find a balance between points and a worthy deck of cards you'll be able to put to use each turn.

I have no idea how many games of Dominion I have played (~75 in person, and another ~50 online?) and I am still nowhere near sick of it. With a couple of expansions, the game has damn near infinite re-playability. Even when you get weird set-ups that don't combine well with each other, it is interesting to see who can adjust best. Deck-building seems to be a game type that CCG, Euro and Ameritrash players can all enjoy, which greatly increases the player base.

Preferred with 2, works well with 3 or 4.

When we got this game, as a wedding gift, I was worried, because I don't like card games. When me and my wife tried it, I learned that I was wrong and that I love this game. Both of us enjoy it, although neither of us have any previous experience in deck building games (or card collection games). There are some nice twists from expected game mechanics (for example, cards that you buy are, contrary to expected behaviour, placed in discard pile) that make difference between good and great game.
There is also game theme which perfectly blends with card names and design. I know that it is eight year old game, but if somebody didn't try it, I highly recommend it!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Great cardbuilder game, only watchout if you combine some stuff out of the expansions you can easy pull half your deck and still got actions to spare, making it a bit hard to keep track of "where was I, what was next to do" 
Little pointer then : Keep track of the actions you still got to do with coins (or something similar).
But tbh; it's as complex as you build your deck, so you had it comming if you find yourself in one of those situations ;-)

So, I was having a great time at a friend's game night. We had just played a fun party game with everyone, when most people left, leaving only a few behind. "I want to play Dominion!" Says my friend. "Man, when you were playing it earlier, it looked really, really boring" I say to myself. I think perhaps I should leave, or just watch them play. But he convinces me to play, preying upon my curiosity given how highly rated the game is by a lot of people. 

Two (maybe three?) hours later, my friend "wins", and I'm not sure exactly what it was that any of us did right, or wrong, to win, or lose. Theories fly around about what we should and should not have done, and comments of "that was so fun" make it around the table.

I am left feeling confused, with a sickening, empty feeling coursing through my veins. And my night was effectively ruined. Why was I feeling this way? The game is certainly not terrible, but there was something about it, and now I know what that is: the game presents itself as a strategic card game while being nothing more than luck of the draw. 

Can one influence how the hand plays out to a certain degree? Yes. But it's smoke and mirrors. I had never played the game in my life, and I was just picking random cards, then playing them in combinations, to which other people said "ooh!" and "ahh!", then suddenly they were copying my "strategy." Only I never felt in control. I only felt I was being given the illusion of control to satisfy the drive to build towards something better. The majority of the "game" was looking back through card combos and deciphering exactly what it meant we could do next. "Two, five, six, one, two, three, ok. Ten, with enough buys to do what I have to do" *contemplates "I'll take a market, a silver, and a moat, with two coppers." Ad nauseum. What was fun about this? Watching other people lay cards down, and then count numbers? 

I mean, it really wasn't tooooo bad, but I honestly have no desire to play again. Maybe if there's free food involved. Or something.

RATING: 7.5
Good game.  I think that there isn't always just one optimal strategy, like most people complain about, but randomizing the layout can definitely make cards overpowered or worthless.  I would be interested in coming up with my own layouts and trying to find the most balanced ways to play. 

if you have mtg experience, and were good at it, you will have an advantage over players who haven't had any experience deckbuilding.  Dominion is an exercise in efficiency.

This game is not a multiplayer solitaire game, if you think it is, you are doing it wrong.  You need to constantly pay attention to what your opponents are doing, and adjust your strategy accordingly.

Seeing as I only have a couple of friends who I would potentially find this challenging with, I probably won't rush out to get expansions, maybe 1 or 2 depending on how often it hits the table.  If I didn't feel so limited by who I can and can't play this with, I would rate it higher.

Dominion has such great depth due to the random deck setup such that I am certain I will own a copy.

It's just that good.

-07/06/09 update = I'm changing this to a 10.  I find I could play this all day/week without stopping with the random deck creation.  I believe this game scratches my old Magic itch unlike its been scratched since I gave that up years ago...without the hundreds neigh thousands of dollars required.  

Thank you Dominion...you are now up there with the best of the best for me

After playing this I was reminded on the time spent playing CCGs for years.  This will cover that itch and does not require the extensive time beforehand perfecting the deck.  On the downside, you cannot spend the time perfecting and designing the deck beforehand.  This game plays roughly the same each time (Buy silver/1-2 cheap actions, buy gold/expensive actions, buy victory points) despite the variety of the cards in play.

It is an addicting game however and one of the few recently I just want to play again right away.  I still have not a game session where I only played it once.  Wisely, the designers made preset action card combos as well as the ability to randomize the deck selection to allow the most replayability.  Certain cards always seem to go faster than others (Village, Market, Festival) while others I have seen purchased once or twice a game total (Adventurer, Library).

Dominion was fun for a while but at this point I would rather not play it. I can be convinced to play it 2-player on the computer but on the tabletop the setup is a chore for a pretty short 2-player game and the game is a chore with more players.

For what it's worth, I like Intrigue better than the original base set.

RATING: 6
One of the classic games. I do not know if this game is the one that created the "deck building" mechanic but, if not, it is the one that popularized it and it was the first game with that system that I ever played, and I simply loved it. The concept is so simple, so neat, but it works amazingly and, on top of that, it is funny to play. You begin the game with a starting set of cards, I thing that you start with 12 and your hand is always 6, then you play those 6 cards, you do one action and one buy, all the played cards plus the bought card go to the discard pile, the you draw the other 6 cards, repeat the sequence of the turn and after that just shuffle the discard pile and those cards that you have bought are now on your active pile of cards: easy and amazing.
Having said that, the problem is that Dominion may have created of popularized the system, but is feels as an incomplete game. Ok, the system is cool, now what? Just buy states and money? What for? When after Dominion I played Thunderstone, it all made sense. That is Dominion but with a purpose. Having said that, it has been a long time since I last played Dominion because the game is no longer within my group of friends, but I would not say no to a round of the game. I may think about buying it to play at home with non-games.
Positive:
1. Deck building
2. Deck building
3. Deck building
4. Easy to explain and play
5. The box is well prepared for fitting all the cards
6 A good option for non-gamers
Negative:
1. Amazing system, but without an interesting purpose. Later games have taken the system to another level: Thunderstone, Mage Knight...
2. The slow player can kill the game. This game can be fun when played quickly
3. Excessive expansions

It's an OK game, but I'm not into:
- the stuff of creating card combos, thinning out the deck, inventing and pursuing a strict strategy etc.
- racing with the above and concurrent VP collecting against the game clock (which is rather short)

But if you like these traits (and - above all - deck building mechanics) this is the game for you.

EDIT: Some action cards are clearly better than others and are bought much more often than others (or always).  Bad.

Dominion is a great card drafting game with a theme that most fantasy-adventure gamers will enjoy. The game requires you to create a balanced deck while recognizing and executing on combinations of cards that will help you to be efficient in racking up points. With so many possible variations there is a lot of replay value in this game. I also really appreciate the organizational design implemented in the packaging with actual names/images of where each card goes that is not provided in similar style games i.e. Sushi Go.

This is pretty much what I expected after reading about it, another good fast card game, which I am a sucker for. Essentially a hand management engine game where you build nice combos by actually building your hand WHILE playing, not before, which is a very neat change and this is the core game. Not sure what the theme is and well, it doesn't matter really. 

The nice thing about deck-building is you choose which cards you are taking into your hand rather than being subjected to the luck of the draw, also in this game you have the exact same choices to choose from for cards as everyone else so this obviously limits the amount of luck. Luck does play a part here however as after buying cards to put in your hand you are now forming a draw pile, this means cards are still coming to you randomly BUT you get to skew to the odds of which cards come to you and how often. 

Another big bonus here, there are 500 cards in the game, the way the intitial action piles are laid out there are many many combinations of different actions you can group together to start a game (25 action piles in total but typically only using 10 at a time, number crunchers how many is that?), this means even by changing say 1 or 2 piles the new combos that become available will change adding new dynamics, this means of course BIG replay value, in those terms. 

Its a fast and easy game to learn (very unlike RFTG in that way) that plays fast with very little downtime, no AP and just a smidgen of interaction thrown in with the screwage and defense cards. It did seem to me the one basic strategy of how and when to shift you focuses seemed obvious for the most part. Gernerally speaking, first start building money so you start see more money and bigger numbers, then start really focusing on the actions which is your engine, finally shift to VP's, going VP's too early gives you dead weight in your hand. I'm not expert after one game and won't claim to be, this is just how I saw it and it did seem obvious, you might disagree. 

Well this game is not without negatives IMO as so far I touched on mostly positives, constant card shuffling being the obvious one (read buy sleeves) and the other being limited depth. Now I did not say no depth and remember the game is fast so I'm not knocking it too much, at least not yet and discovering all the best working combos is fun. I think the games 'width' makes up for the depth, in other words there are so many different combos to discover with all the cards that you won't notice the lacking depth so much at first but to me the overall scope in a game is truly limited. The price in this case is another along with box size, 2 things I normally don't ever complain about. 40 or 45 bucks seems pretty steep even if there are 500 cards and tons of replay value, 30 was fair for sure and I think 35 most people could fathom (it was 30 Euro afterall in Europe)

Summary - If you like games like San Juan, RFTG or want a nice 30 minute meaty card game that scales 2 to 4 this is a pretty safe purchase. I think the price is too high and I have too many games already so I'll play friends copies and try to get it in a trade maybe later. 

UPDATE: 7.5 => 7  That was fast (2 plays). So much for the replay value if you don't really want to play it, I might not turn down a game but I would rather play something else given a choice. I really don't find enough interesting decisions here, add a card to your hand, add a card to your hand etc, its a decent filler but I would choose to play RFTG over this or any number of actual full course games...  OVERHYPED IMHO and better suited for online play to avoid shuffling. 

Edit - played a few more times on my phone with a free program I have and the game just leaves me cold. Pure "deckbuilding only" makes a decent filler, just not one I particularily enjoy (tried a few others too) yet its hard to fault the game since it at least gets the playtime versus what you get right. Maybe "A few acres of snow" will make a game out of deckbuilding...  

The HYPE MACHINE really went out of control here on this one I mean top 10?  The ratings on BGG have 'jumped the shark' on this and proved what many already knew, they are a popularity contest for the 'cult of the new' and not really useful anymore sadly.

More interesting and fun to play than say Race for the Galaxy or San Juan as far as card games go, though I know they are different types of games. Look forward to trying it again. Probably would never own it even if I didn't know someone who already did. 

Its short, so it has that going for it. I think you need to play it alot to really appreciate it and I probably won't do that. But I will play it again. Like I said its short and painless. Good game to end a game night with.

I really love this game.When I first played it I thought of my days of playing magic and how we always were looking to build the perfect deck with the right balance of land cards versus the other cards.In this game you are building your deck as you play and are looking to buy the right combination of cards and hope to get them in your hand at the right time.the 25 different type of kingdom cards makes for alot of different games and strategies that can be used based on which cards are in play.

Good game, great design to start the deck building craze. Playing with certain cards can make the game seem scripted or predetermined on what you may play. Discovering the combos the first time is fun, but playing with players of similar familarities/skill levels with the game is a necessity.

oh boy... this one is fun and *very* addictive...

After our first play, my wife and I could both see strategies we wanted to try "next game" as it's pretty easy to see what cards did/didn't work with your strategy.  I find myself thinking about strategies and card combinations a lot...  There seems to be a strong metagame here.

The random nature of choosing which ten kingdoms cards to play with is so, so, so awesome and really changes the feel of one game to the next.

So extemely happy they are expanding the game constantly: I can see this game getting played by my wife and I (and taught to our friends) for years to come.  

This game, more than any other, has caused our non-game-playing friends to suddenly become *very* interested in our hobby.

I hate to sound so snobbish, but this game was brilliant when it first came out and I loved it for a long time, but I got terribly tired of it. People complain about pasted on theme and little to none interaction. As a Euro-gamer I can forgive that. What made me move on from it was my decision became so automatic. I know the expansions might have fixed that somewhat, but I didn't want to invest in the system any more. I am currently enjoying Friday and Star Realms right now. We'll see if they last longer than Dominion for me.

Seems to scratch my CCG itch to some extent, an itch I've ignored for close to a decade now. It's feels good to finally scratch it. I love the interact of the cards and how some games have a lot of interaction between players and other games have none.  It makes every game very different. However, I have found that some cards can be almost completely useless if they aren't paired up with the correct card(s). So I guess you need to make the occasional executive decision and opt out a set of cards for another.  

I look at this as a new form of CCG though as there could be endless expansions for this card. 

**UPDATE** Uh oh...better duck, here come the expansions in full force! I wish this insert wasn't so limited.

**UPDATE** Wow, the avalanche of expansions has been incredible.  I jumped off early though, the minute I played Thunderstone!  A deck-building dungeon crawl?!?  Well...almost, but Thunderstone has launched itself into my top 2 favorite games; at least for the time being. Meanwhile my Dominion games have become expendable and I'll be trading them.

Excellent game. With expansions it has a lot of re-playability. After many plays, I still enjoy it but it's very solitairy and can be quite slow in games where there are lots of +cards/+actions combos.

Best as a 3player to keep the pace up when players do have long turns.

Only difficulty is how you choose the setups; some setups can be so bad that it's just best to ignore and go big money, or they may cause an incredibly slow game (eg lots of curses and no trashing). In such cases you need to recognise this at the start and choose another setup, or make a small change.

Oh man, what a breakthrough this game was for me.  As most people know, this game started a whole new genre of gaming and is still one of the best of the deck builders.  This doesn't make it to the table as much any more due Star Realms just being so much quicker to set up and play, but this one will most likely never leave my collection.

Own: Base, Intrigue, Seaside, Prosperity, Alchemy
I would not recommend the Alchemy set nearly as much as the others.  I will not be buying any more expansions because what I have now fits perfectly in the base box after tossing the insert.  Or maybe I'll replace Alchemy some day...

Dominion is considered by many to be the Grandfather of Deck Building Games.  I was hooked the first time I played it at friend's game night.  I enjoyed it so much, I went and bought my own copy of it within a week.  I've introduced it to other friends and they have also enjoyed the game.

The base is pretty amazing by itself and there are several expansions to add on it, but the only expansion I consider worthwhile is the Prosperity Expansion.

Works, but I found the endless shuffling annoying and the lack of theme sad. Little tension. Yet another euro (get the economic engine going and then time your switch to VPs) but this time in card form. Nothing really new.

I'd say if you like Race for the Galaxy (which I don't), you'll like this.

This is a solid game, and one of the most important game releases in recent years. It is highly addictive and good with several different number of player variations. It also does a good job of changing variables, but those variables don't impact the strategies much in the long run. After it runs out of its new factor, it becomes very obvious of the need to buy an expansion.

RATING: 8
Dominion is a good, fast game when I'm not looking to think too much past the next hand but is sufficiently challenging that it keeps me engaged.  There is a set of ten cards you can buy to add to your deck and as the game goes along you add to your deck according to your strategy, using your coin cards.  The goal is to increase the coin count of your hand enough to start being able to afford the victory point cards.  The cards are either coins for buying, victory points for winning, or action cards for having interesting and useful effects.  The composition of the deck you build determines the hands you draw, so you form a strategy on what cards you want to buy at the very start of the game and then each hand do what you can with the hand you draw.  Theme is sort of generically medieval.  The variety of possible action cards and they way they can interact, with only ten being in play in a given game, provide it with significant replay potential.

Not exactly sure why this didn't hit it off for me.  I think it was because it seemed flat.  By that I mean, it was just deck building, and I think there was a way to brake the game.  Admittedly, it's been a year or so since I gave this a play.  I should revisit and modify this review.

Just played first game after, wait for it, three years.  My son is my gaming partner, given his age, vast gaming experience, we had a much better experience with Dominion than we had previously.   Really enjoyed the variety of options.  Again, it's purely deck building, and maybe I need something extra, but this was a fun game after all. Glad we came back to it.  

Got in 3 more games tonight with my older son, a non-gamer.  Because Dominion is very much limited to a single mechanic, he was willing to play. He won one and lost another by only a point.  Conclusion: good game for your non- gamer friends. 

Okay, 2017. We all got hooked. We started to see strategies and combos, got familiar with the cards, tried a couple of expansions and even the online version.  We love the game. It really took on a different feeling this time around.  Picked up Guilds and Cornocopua.  Had a blast.  One of our oldest games, and now one of our best.

RATING: 8
Dominion is the standard to which I hold all other deckbuilding games. I've yet to find another game that surpasses it. It's one of the few where all the cards are out on the table (literally) - almost every other attempt at deckbuilding has injected some sort of randomness that takes away from the strategic nature of the gameplay.

I do understand some of the complaints about it lacking direct interaction, but this doesn't bother me that much.

DISCLAIMER: My rating here is for the series. The base game, after many, many plays has lost its luster. I still enjoy it and recommend it to newcomers, but I prefer to add in some expansions. If I had to rate the base set by itself, it would only be a six for me.

== Initial comments after a few plays

Snowball engine card game.  I like the idea of building your deck as you go, but I miss having a tableau like with Magic or Race.

Since I got tired of waiting for it, I proxied the entire game and played it ~10 times with that set.  I've since played about 15 times on BSW, and it's much better on the computer.  No setup/teardown (which is fairly annoying in this game), no shuffling every 45 seconds, and no worries about trying to find sleeves for non-standard card sizes.

Early indications are that the Chapel card may be broken beyond repair.  Certain cards hose it, without themselves being broken, but if those aren't in the mix the game devolves into trashing your start cards for some silver and gold, buying a card drawer or two, and then buying a Province every turn.

Got an opportunity to play the prototype. Unique gameplay that intrigues me enough that I'd like to keep exploring it. A little concerned about the potential tedium of frequently reshuffling my draw deck, and the amount of wear that'll generate on the cards. Certainly don't want to have to play someone's sleeved deck due to the amount of shuffling required, and wondering if people will insist on sleeving the cards to try and avoid wear and tear. How to play the cards in hand was often obvious, requiring little thought, but what choices to make in "drafting" new cards as a result of that play seemed to offer adequate options and decision making.

RATING: 10
It can play very differently depending on which cards are in the setup, but even with the same setup, there's usually some room for variety.  With the expansions, there are now lots and lots of cards, but that can be deceptive.  Some cards play very similarly, so that a strategy for one card will work pretty much the same for a similar card.  Example: Village and Mining Village.  But some cards that look very similar end up playing very differently, so it's good to approach each new card with an open mind.  Example: Mine, Remodel, and Upgrade.

It took me a few plays to warm up to this game.  I never disliked it, but it didn't become one of my favorite games immediately.  But it didn't take that long to get there.

I think the best way to learn is the "First Game" setup, especially for those who aren't "gamers".  Most gamers should do all right going with a different setup, but I don't recommend it.  Once you've learned the game, usually it's best to use a random selection of cards, because then everyone has to adapt to whatever cards come up instead of playing their favorite strategy over and over again.  As more expansions come out, it becomes harder to just do Random 10 from everything, but you can mix and match sets and then go random from that.

I generally don't like lots of Attack cards, but I will play them if the situation calls for it.

Full disclosure: I am a lead playtester.  I became a lead playtester after Seaside came out, but Dominion was my top-rated game long before that.

When this game was first announced and came out I thought it sounded like another "Race for the Galaxy" which imho is overly complex (especially compared to "San Juan")... however this game is almost nothing like RftG... a nice simple filler.  The biggest problem is the shuffling all the time especially in the 1st 1/2 of the game when you have a small deck.

I normally don't like victory point based games, but this one is designed very well. Add in the expansions and you have a fun game with almost endless variety. The rules are pretty simple and quick to pick up. Gameplay is quick and it doesn't take a long time to pick up the strategy.

It's easy to see how this has become compulsively popular. It feels well balanced as you try to find that golden path of deck composition from available buys and not loose out to attacks, except when the field's open for a straight race for chapel or garden decks. However, for me that compulsiveness takes away some of the fun of a more chancy game with a stronger theme.

So far, so good. While not a personal favorite, I have enjoyed my games so far, and the game definitely improves when players become more experienced & quick to take their turns. Playing it with 5 players (modifying game end conditions a bit) seems entirely feasible.

While no relation in terms of mechanics, Dominion nevertheless reminds me of St. Petersburg. They both have that hypnotic "let's just play one game more" quality.

Finally got to give this one a try (9/19/2009). I only played one game, but I can see why this game is so appealing to many. It is, like a number of popular euro games, essentially about building an engine that can net you victory points in the end, but the method for doing so is unique. Looking forward to playing it again.

Ridiculously fun game.  It always sounds pretty dull when the rules are explained, but once players actually get into the game, they almost always enjoy it.  Each player is a member of the monarchy, vying for control of the kingdom.  They build up their kingdom by buying cards for their decks, and trying to gain victory points.

I've not played this in months.  I still think it's the best deckbuilder out there, but I'm not dying to get it to the table, and other people are chasing hot new things.  I've lowered my rating of all Dominion stuff by 1 point, and will likely never buy Adventures, despite it looking pretty cool.

I feel as though my plays vastly under-represent how much time I've spent playing this game and all of its expansions (with the exception of Alchemy -3 plays- and the Black Market and Stash cards - 1 each-). I would be over the 100 plays mark, which is a lot considering I first played the game less than a year ago. 

There was a period in the Spring where my boyfriend and I would average about 12 plays each weekend night (we'd start at about 9 and go to bed at 3, leaving the table set up for the morning). I have a feeling as though my playing has peaked and thus this list will never represent the time I've spent enjoying this game.

Dominion is the best deck building game out there, It has some luck but 9 times out of 10 the best player will win. It´s in my top ten and I think it will stay there for a long time. I love it. 

Only downside for me is the constant shuffling of cards and that’s why I prefer to play it over the internet but I won´t refuse a face to face play :D.

I love Dominion, I just updated the rate from 9.0 to 9.5. Dominion is a GREAT game by itself but (at least for me) it´s the expansions that gave it a lot of life, mostly Prosperity. Without the expansions I would rate Dominion at 8.5.

Dominion is THE deckbuilding game. I have tried many deckbuilding games but no one comes close to touching the king. Most have failed to grasp what makes Dominion great, namely: limited buys, limited actions, static market offering that allows for real strategic plays and fairness to all players. Without these, the strategy is to buy the most expensive card you can afford. In Dominion many times you want to buy cheaper cards because they complement your overall strategy. In fact the most powerful card in the base game is the Chapel which is very cheap.

I always want to play Dominion one more time, it is very addictive, easy to explain and quick to play. I also really like the expansions, they add a lot of replayability and endless combinations to try. Even the base game has a lot of combinations to try. It is a bit thin on the thematic side (it doesn’t bother me), but I do feel the theme through the cards (the player with the most lands wins the game). Amazing art.
 
Dominion is one my most played games (not counting MtG which I played for most than a decade).

I don’t have anything bad to say. If pressed I would say setting up the game can be tedious with all the expansions, also transporting and storing it can be a chore. About the gameplay, the shuffling can bother some people, but not me. I love the game. It can be hard to catch the runaway leader, but as the game is (generally) short I don’t really care about this.

I think they won´t release anymore expansions, but if they do I will happily buy them. I have all things Dominion (even Alchemy, the worst expansion). I expect I will continue to play it ten years from now.

Contrary to what the BGG poll says, I prefer to play Dominion with only two players. I won’t refuse three or four players games but they add a lot of uncontrollable luck and downtime. Both negative things for me.

It is a shame they closed down Isotropic and the game isn’t available on iOS yet. I know Goko has a website but last time I was there it wasn’t very good and it was very expensive, basically I would have to repurchase every expansion. Things could have changed now though, I have to review this again.

After careful consideration, there are almost no game I  would play instead of Dominion (there are only 2). Even if we play only the base game I always have fun with it, so the rating of 9.5 applies to the base game as well.

I LOVE it, the best deck builder game ever made.

As other commenters have noticed Dominion tends to keep one thinking about combinations and tweaks long after leaving the table, a sign of a potentially great game.

Dominion is less prone to the Race for the Galaxy criticism of "lack of player interaction" because of its customizable starting configuration.  Lack of targeted "screw you" cards keep the focus on your own deck, though; all interactive effects are global and affect all other players, though potentially some worse than others.

I prefer to play with 3, 2, and 4 in that order.  With 4 the game feels like it has too much downtime, which sounds ridiculous since there's about 30 seconds between turns but there it is.  2 is excellent but a tad too zero-sum and easy to track for my taste.  3-player Dominion strikes a great balance between the two.

I've pretty well burned myself out on Dominion, and I'm not likely to suggest it again in the near future.  For all the good qualities - and there are many - I find the attacks a little too passive-aggressive and take-that, and the system a little stale without them.  I've lost too many frustrating games in which I get hosed by the draw order that I'm not sure I trust my wins either.  Still a good game, but if I'm looking for a filler-length game I'll suggest RFTG.

I play Dominion less than I might otherwise because of the deck-destruction attacks:  Thief in the basic set and Saboteur/Swindler in the Intrigue expansion.  Frequently people want to play with 10 random cards, and since I'm not willing to play a game with any of those three I'll usually play something else.  Oddly I don't mind the Witch as much since she only adds Curses, not taking away a card I've already bought.

Fun game but I find it moves a bit too fast for me. I feel like it's a race to shuffle and deal, especially in the two player game. Still, I enjoy making the card combinations and my wife loves it.

I think it's clever and I enjoyed it. 

It's very smooth and fast, but I wasn't really gobsmacked; I think I need more plays to have it bloom--it is quite quick to play, but I have handicapped friends who it's dead for simply due to the shuffling.

During this first blush rating, it seems to be lacking something to draw me in and engage my imagination. I wonder about it's long term playability, but I'll need more plays to judge this.

I did enjoy the game--I just didn't feel like I was making any real decisions. Right now, I put this down to being a rookie with the system.

This game is brilliant.  It is such a fast playing game, each game is different, and the depth of strategic change from game to game is truly amazing.  I always liked the game, but I don't think I fully appreciated its brilliance until around the 100th play or so.  It starts good and gets better.

The only thing that keeps this game and its expansions from being a 10 is that, once I discovered it online, I don't want to play it in person any more.  A game can be played so quickly online and there is no shuffling.  It's hard to justify getting it out with the family.

Four plays only, which I very much enjoyed. Basic premise is simple, fun and refreshingly different. 

Not sure how deep into the plethora of alternative action cards I'd want to go - clutter/payoff ratio might lean a little towards the clutter end of things.

While I enjoy it, my suspicion is that there's not really a massive amount in here, so I prefer playing it as a quickfire game. My main beef with the game is downtime - call me impatient but I find myself getting frustrated by some of the longer turns that can be strung together with use of the village etc. 'OK, so I've taken two actions so far but I've still got 3 actions remaining, and a credit of two extra treasure, and I can still draw two extra cards .. or was it 4 actions remaining??' JUST GET THE F*****G CARDS DOWN, IT'S NOT CHESS, YOU CAN ONLY BUY ONE CARD!!

RATING: 8
Well I get the hype...a fast almost filler type game that has enough meat to keep a core gamer happy but also simple enough to please the casual gamer.  Given the intial design and the number of expansions that have come out I doubt this game will quickly go to the wayside for the mass of people.  I've actually not played this live yet (10+ plays on BSW) but I've honestly had a great time with it.  I'm excited to get it to the table!  As of right now I would rank this card game right up there with Race for the Galaxy.  At some point in time it might actually exceed it just given that there will be infinitely more oppertunites for me to get this game to the table as opposed to RFTG.  

This game has turned out to be a big hit with pretty much everyone I've played it with...going to bump this rating up a bit.

***For awhile there it was getting over played but gotta say this gamed appealed to everyone...even the female gamers of the group enjoyed it.  In terms of card games while very different in feel from RFTG and San Juan it should be mentioned with those in so much as they are some of the best card games out there.

Just played 13 times in two days.  And I can't wait to do it again tomorrow.  

This game is addictive, and ever changing.  I highly recommend using a pre-set for your first couple of games (I like Big Money and Interaction better than the "First Game" set-up), and then switch to a random set from then on.

A non-existent learning curve.  With the best part of MtG being deck construction, I can't believe it took this long for this idea to arrive.  Excellent!

Update:  After 30 plays or so, the time has come to say that this is a 10 game for me.  I'm sure I won't _always_ want to play 30 games in a week of this game, but it has real legs.  And the possibility for expansion presages a renewal every so often that will be exciting.

RATING: 6
A decent puzzle game that left me completely flat.  I am NOT a big CCG fan, and I guess I just don't like the 'deck building' feel of Dominion.

Sure, there's lots to do and every game will be different... but it still feels too much like multi-player solitaire for my liking.  I've only played a few times now and it seems like the first person to buy gets a slight advantage, and the first person to be 'cursed'  (especially if it's early in the game) is at a disadvantage.

The good thing is that it is very quick playing, otherwise my rating would have probably been lower.

RATING: 5
Had a chance to break this one out to new non-board game friends. After the first game, everyone got what the game was about, and second play went a lot more smoothly.

For such an amazingly easy to teach game, this game is packed with so many strategies which is a huge plus. But theme is just bone dry... It just felt like shuffle shuffle draw do stuff written on cards. And I could see that people were not really getting into the game at all although they got the mechanic down perfectly after 1st play through. 

With more plays, it just feels like exercise to me. Only having 10 kingdom cards in each individual game seems to be main problem. I think that I much prefer Thunderstone with its epic variant.

And after trying out so many different games, I decided that deck building games are not really for me. I would still play only if someone strongly wanted to try out what the Dominion-love was all about. I like the deck building mechanism; but if whole game is dedicated to just that, I think that it loses the charm. For example, I love the deck building aspect in MK, or any other CCG where I get to build the deck beforehand.

RATING: 4
We had some fun, and is well balanced, but somehow boring during the plays.. while in Race for the Galaxy i can hardly wait for my turn and planning strategy, this one is just boring. Dont have to think a lot. Im not pro though, i know there are many kind of stuff you can take in account for your next action.. but i just get bored. And when someone uses a lot of action cards, its just total boring, even if we can make 10 min rounds.

For a card based game this is cleverly done, and feels little different every game time since theres so many card options. All would be otherwise well, but cards are not balanced as well as they should, there are some card combinations that are most of the time winning this game. Then there are many type of cards that are never used, since they aren`t helping anyway. Thats bad.

Great lightweight game that plays fast (20-90 minutes depending on group and card selection).  Some will complain about the constant shuffling - whatever.  The choices are interesting and allow some flexibility during the course of the game.  It certainly isn't deep, but it offers enough to keep me interested.  Besides, the Mrs. likes it which is always a sign that it'll hit the table often. The idea of expansions adds even more replayability (at the cost of buying them though).

RATING: 7.5
I like this game, Its easy to pick up and fairly easy to play well. However after about 5 or 6 games sessions, its starting to wear a little thin.

I feel i need to get more expansions now, after 5 or 6 games sessions, which is a little annoying. but the ability to select random sets of cards does add a good replay-ability factor. 

However this does sometimes lead to having no counters in the games for certain cards.

Certainly worth adding to the collection

The first deckbuilding game. It sets up a new genre of boardgames that have quickly multiplied. The first 25 kingdom card are fun to play. Having 10 of the 25 sets to choose from leads to many many unique games. Adding all the sets in is mathmetically mind boggoling.

The ability to choose what cards go into your deck can range from the obivious to combo cards for later in the game. A well thought out game.

Copy what your opponent is doing (not recommended) to just gathering money to buy Victory Point cards. (Big Money).

This game has set a high standard for all deckbuidling games that come in the future.

A relative quick set up time. Not much down time unless your opponent likes to draw a lot of cards and not do much else. Takes a little bit of time to put away since the cards will be needed to be sorted out. But that gives you time to brag or lament about the previous game.

Easy to learn. Easy to teach. Can be quite addictive.

Yes it lives up to the hype for it. Deckbuilding fun. Curses, now I will have to save up and buy all the rest of the expansions.

I like the fact that this game is rather straight forward with play and that there are many variables to play so you most likely won't be playing with the same cards everytime unless you specifically set it up that way.  Good game that scratches the itch of the CCG in me with out having for fork out thousands of dollars to have a competitive deck.

Fast action deck building game.  My kids and I enjoy it, but be prepared to spend approximately $200 for expansions if it hooks you.  Only 10 sets of kingdom cards are used for each game, so there is a HUGE number of potential setups.  Look online for many suggested fun setups.

RATING: 5
What am I missing? It felt like there were too many riches to be plucked each turn, from the start and it only grew from there. I want scarcity, challenge, tension, not an ever-growing deck of power and plenty. I also didn't like the lack of player interaction (yet again). And, geez, all that shuffling.  I can see how others might find the mechanic addictive, but for me it was just tedious. 
Addendum: found Puzzle Strike, solves the problems.

The amount of variety and play in this base box is amazing.  Trading out even one or two sets of cards can completely change your strategy.  It's easy to teach and with each card basically explaining how to use it, it only takes a couple plays for this game to hum along.  Turns move fast and I actually prefer the cards that limit interaction with other players.  With the crazy number of quality expansions available, this game is a classic of rare quality.

[thing=142131]Dominion Big Box Edition[/thing]

In Dominion, each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards. In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can "buy" as they can afford them. Through their selection of cards to buy, and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end.

One of the two games (along with Agricola) that started my 'modern' board game interest. My collection grew until the reported quality issues with Adventures. I vowed to not purchase it until they were rectified. A couple of years later, when the reprint finally came, I realised I didn't want it. I did buy Empires and regretted it. The difference in quality between earlier expansions is really obvious. The victory point tokens, for example, are supposed to match but are completely different.

Rating based on two plays with the starting card decks. Didn't blow me away, but I liked it enough to order it rather quickly. I am guessing that once I get the other card decks involved, my rating will go up.

Edit: Have played more, and while it's a solid game, it still just doesn't excite us. Lowing the rating from 7.5 to 7.

Dominion is fine, and it introduced us to the deck-building mechanic.  Beyond that, it is a fine game, but nowhere near its current rank as the 11th best game on BGG.  Once everyone knows what the optimal strategies are, Dominion starts to feel very scripted.  I've enjoyed seeing the mechanics introduced by Dominion go to new places, but the original deck-builder has been outclassed.

Dominion is an innovate game that deserves due credit for inventing the "deckbuilding" genre. It is easy to teach/learn, plays quickly, and provides a tremendous number of combinations. The hidden scoring system provides a great element of suspense. Weaknesses include shuffling ad nauseum, lack of meaningful player interaction, and the feeling that you're not really "doing" anything. While it isn't a favorite, I'll still play and will always respect its contribution to the hobby.

2nd ed. w/promos, (former longtime MtG player) We enjoy the utter simplicity in game play with no gray areas (instants/interrupts) as found in MtG, though the 'direct' path to victory quickly reveals itself in ultimately collecting Gold and Province cards... and this bothers me quite a bit.  As a result, it's preventing me from considering further expansions to the game.  Nevertheless, a very decent game of deck building on the fly.  Rating is for 2-player games only.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Caveat: I'm a sub-contracted playtester.

The game that got me to stop playing Race for the Galaxy.  I think I've played Race three times since I first played Dominion, and I don't even have ready access to a copy of Dominion!  This is only the third game I've rated a 10, and my first new 10 since the day I joined BGG.  I think it's that good, folks.

The replayability is high, player interaction can be very high (depends on the card sets in use), group-think can be a factor, human psychology can be a factor.  Play with the same set of 10 cards and refine your strategy; switch out just one card for another and it's like a completely different game.

There are 3268760 combinations of decks (25 things, 10 at a time or 25!/(10!*15!)).  If only one tenth of one percent of those possible deck combinations are "good" (for some definition of "good"), that's 3268 different sets.  If every one of them is "solvable" in a single sitting, that's still 3268 playings of a game with no repeats in strategies!

When we were misplaying the curse cards, this was a fun and exciting game with a lot of player interaction - just about everyone who played it bought a copy, and it was in demand at our local board game night.  We were even trying out suggestions to add more players to the game, because we'd have six or seven interested. I had it rated as an 8.
Now that I've played with the clarified rules, I have to say that I'm underwhelmed.  It's a nice mental exercise, but would work much better on the computer than in person.
Perhaps that's why many of it's biggest fans play on-line?

Yet another arbitrarily medieval-themed game, but I thought it was decent. Any complaints about "too much shuffling" are clearly overblown--it really isn't that bad, and everyone should be so lucky to play any game enough times that the components show some wear. 

I'm curious about the attack cards. The two players who employed them most heavily finished well behind the front two...I finished in 2nd place with scores: 42, 33, 14, 11. Is the negative effect you give to others damaging enough to warrant passing up a chance to buy cards that give you additive benefits (Throne Rooms, Markets, Festivals, etc)?

The deck building aspect is interesting but it grew old fast. The starting sets of cards are good however just randomly choosing kingdom cards to form the play set can lead to some horrendous games. To design an enjoyable set of kingdom cards can become a neat exercise.

This was probably our third "gamer's" game, after Settlers of Catan and Carcassonne.  I picked it up at Hastings just based on the SdJ logo (since SoC and Carc had also won).  It was an instant hit with my wife and me and we have played a ton (but none since I started logging plays in early 2016).  It also triggered my collector's itch and I have grabbed a ton of expansions and promo's.  My kids love it and we should really get them playing it more.

RATING: 9
One of the very best. Tight; engaging; perfectly weighted, plenty of variety; excellent tactical and strategic balance.

A sugaring of luck from card shuffling, but the player who assesses the synergy of the available cards and follows the most efficient strategy will prevail. The game gears beautifully, with the starting game engine building (and culling), while the late games becomes a dash for the victory point finishing line. 

Players have to read the game and judge when their engine will be efficient enough to make a break for the finish; jump too early or too late and you'll likely lose. Several times I've messed up and all players have dashed too soon only to find us all have to return to improving the engine to close out the game.

Pros: 
- almost perfect in every way. 
- great game length.
- easy to teach, hard to master.
- an excellent amount of repeated game play.
- numerous interesting decisions.

Cons:
- Honestly can't think of anything wrong with this game; perhaps some of the card abilities aren't perfectly aligned with the card's theme; but the overall theme/flavour of the game is enough to overcome.

I love the concept of building your deck on the fly. Dominion is very fun and quick and not hard to get into. A more needed variety of cards is my only complaint but the expansions help that issue out. Great game!

This is a good game with lots of expansions to diversify.  I like that the strategy can change with every game setup depending on the cards that are used.

RATING: 9
Very nice game. It has an innovative way of drafting and cycling through cards that's very entertaining. You can take different strategic approaches, but their success will have a lot to do with how the cards come up. In the tradition of board games that masquerade as card games, this is a very good one.

UPDATE: Despite this game's popularity on this site, everyone who I have introduced it to has had the response of "meh". Gamers and non-gamers both. Sadly, I may not have opponents for this game. I should stop buying expansions now....

UPDATE #2: Discovered that my girlfriend loves this game so I've gotten to play it a lot more, AND I have gotten all of the expansions. Ah, what love will do. I have upped my rating to a 9. Not just because I'm really enjoying the game play, but I have more appreciation for the invention of the deck-building mechanic. There hasn't been a new mechanic of this quality and usability in a while (I write this in June 2013). Seeing how this has been implemented creatively in so many other games is impressive.

El creador de la mecánica de Construcción de mazos.

Muy fácil de explicar, muy fácil de jugar.. Los jugadores empiezan exáctamente con el mismo mazo y tendrán que desarrollar y mejorar su propio mazo. Para hacer esto, los jugadores deben de comprar las cartas que se encuentran en la zona central. Esas cartas están repartidas en pilas distintas dependiendo del tipo de carta.

Cuando juegas ó compras una carta, ésta va diréctamente a tu pila de descartes. al final del turno tendrás que descartar tus cartas restantes y coger 5 de tu mazo para el turno siguiente. Cada vez que tu mazo se acabe, barajas tu pila de descartes y coges 5 cartas. Las cartas pueden proporcionar más cartas, más acciones, más compras, dinero, puntos de victoria...

Un juego muy divertido pero a veces un poco solitario, dependiendo de los mazos iniciales escogidos. Con más de 500 cartas tienes juego para rato.

The creator of the Deck Building mechanic.

Very easy to explain, very easy to play. Players start with exactly the same deck and they will have to develop and upgrade their own deck. To do so, players need to buy the cards laying on the pool. Those cards are spread in different stacks depending of the type of the card.

When you play a card or when you buy a card, you put them on your own discard pile. At the end of a turn you have to discard your remaining cards and get 5 new cards from your deck for the next turn. Every time your deck runs out you shuffle your discard pile and get 5 cards. Cards can provide more actions, more cards, more purchases, money, victory points...

Very fun game but sometimes a kind of solitaire game, depending on the starting decks chosen. With 500 cards you have game for a while.[/color]

RATING: 5
The Good: Dominion plays fast, is mechanically smooth, easy to teach and learn, and the variance in decks should be enough to keep the game feeling fresh for a while. 

The Bad: Dominion is ALL deck building with very little interaction. Not bad if you like those sort of games, and in fact I think its a great gateway and good for ex-Magic fans.

The Ugly: Dominion is nothing more than its core mechanic. I spend all my time spending cards to buy cards, so I can spend better cards to buy better cards. Rinse and repeat. I feel no real sense of accomplishment, strategy, tactics, or drama. I simply build up a deck of cards and play whatever I randomly draw. 

WIFE RATING - 3

My wife was extremely bored and felt like she was on "auto-pilot" after the first couple of hands. She'd play it again but not without protest.

RATING: 7
Rating after about 35-40 plays now, the last five with the real game but all the others with a prototype.  No doubt, the deck-building theme is innovative, but at its heart this is a card game, with a significant luck factor involved, for me meaning it is a great filler at best.  I imagine it will eventually fulfill a role similar to San Juan, which I wound up rating a 6 after some initial excitement.  When the excitement wears off, perhaps this game will settle in there too, but for right now I give the extra bump for originality.  But is it a top 10 or even a top 20 game?  No way, IMHO.

I used to really be into CCG's like Magic the Gathering. Finally realisiing the money pit they were, this game is about as close to a CCG as I get now. First time you see it set up it looks so much more complex than it actually is.

I need to catch up a bit. I have played the original game lots of time, but so far only a couple of games of Intrigue and I don't even have a copy of Seaside, though that is yet. 

I do have Seaside now and I have used some of the cards from it. I like it a lot better than Intrigue.

Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Amazing game.  Great, landmark design which could have made all kinds of errors but didn't.  Apart from a minor quibble about the strength of the chapel the base set is well balanced and plays fine, so regardless of the possibly inevitable over-powered cards in future expansions we can always come back to this.  Plays great on BSW, but unlike Saint Petersburg, also plays fine face-to-face as well.
Update:  after over 300 games (3/4 on BSW), I am starting to tire of it a little.  It does get quite processional, and strategies in most sets are reasonably obvious, although that is not a bad thing for a 10 minute game on BSW.  Can be REALLY tedious playing F2F with new players - I doubt I would teach this game any more.  Rating knocked down to 8.
Update 2014:  1000 plays on AndroMinion now, which takes about 5 minutes per game and underlines how slow it is in real life - the set up and pack up time is just too long.  Also, the game is really swingy - the luck of the draw is very large.

Will play anytime and will play multiple games in a row.  Can't say that about many games.  The random setup gives the game a fresh feel every play.  Love games with the witch - it really messes up the scoring often leaving people with negative or very low scores as both the witch and the curses run out - and just one other card running out ends the game, which will be the moat if its in there.

As a former Magic, Wildstorms, Werewolf, Overpower, and Vampire player, I lived through all the cardboard crack that I thought I needed. I didn't realize I would bring all that back with Dominion. All the addiction without the bigger price tag. Although it is lacking a little on player interaction, I love the puzzling of how to race faster than your opponent. Although now I play way more on isotropic, this still is fun with a bunch of diehards that wants to outdo each other with another rematch right behind.

Re-discovered the iOS version on my iPod (yes, the version that's no longer available) and proceeded to play almost 80 games straight off. Realized I was slightly addicted so I bought the real-life card version.
Easy to learn; not so easy to master; requires very little set-up and time to play (relatively speaking, that is); has tons of depths that are waiting for discovery as you work your way further into it.

RATING: 8
Dominion is simple to teach others with quick play, so there is little down time between turns.  This makes it an ideal game to introduce friends and family to quality gaming.  Although the mechanics are simple, implementing a proper strategy as the game develops is difficult.  With the nearly limitless number of set up combinations, plus the new expansions sets, it is a game that will never get old.

RATING: 6
Rating with 80+ plays. (Rating increased to an 8 after 15 plays and to a 9 after 30 plays). 

A heartwarming concept and a slick design. The game gets a lot better once you're familiar with the cards and ready to deal ten random for the set-up. For new players I recommend twice with the basic set-up, twice with "big money," and then ten random. 

Make no mistake, Dominion is a build-income / buy victory points game. I'd love to see the deck-building harnessed to a different objective, but it's still a compelling, fast, and abundantly replayable game. Two players can sit down and blow through 6-8 games without breaking stride. In fact, that's how I prefer to play this game. Don't be deceived by the 15-20 minute playing time (with two players). An evolving series of 6+ games is the way to sink your teeth into this one. Better in 2 1/2 hour doses once a week than a quick fix every day. 

After 80 plays, I've noticed that experienced players wear out a bit on a few cards: Chapel, Gardens, and Thief. Each alters the game significantly, and after you've played as many games as I have, you're usually looking for a flexible set-up that allows you to tinker.

UPDATE (5/09): I just played for the first time in three or so months. Now that I've fully sated myself on the originality of the concept, I'm finding it more comforting than thrilling or engaging. The forum comments about it being "advanced slot machines" or an "iteratively biased random number generator" ring true. I've downgraded my rating to an 8, where I think it will sit. I whole-heartedly recommend playing this game at least a half-dozen times for the innovation though (see what you think).  

Update (6/09): The truth is, I have no desire to play this until an expansion comes out. I feel like I've seen 99% of what there is to see. I realize now how much the initial experience was about novelty - much more so than with many other games. I like the speed of play and the deck-building-on-the-fly. But at the end of the day, it remains disheartening to see this level of innovation welded to such pedestrian "VP race" gear-shifting. I'd like to see much more now that the basic concept has been established. My 8 rating was an afterglow. I'll give Intrigue a shot but I don't have high expectations.

Fresh & unique.  Both simple and complex at the same time.  Incredible depth & replayability that cannot be seen just by reading the rules.  

The game is much more in what's NOT there than what's there.  It's also much less about playing your cards than building your deck.  Many players who complain about how the game plays on autopilot really don't get this.

You play from five cards off the top of your deck which gives you actions or money to buy more cards. You buy the cards that you think will give you the strongest deck. Cards can give you more actions or cards and those can allow you to build up a combo of many cards. You also need to buy coins to strenthen the deck. Finally once the deck is strong enough you can buy victory points. There have been a number of expansions and it is fun trying the many different types of cards.

It's somtheing new and original. It's amazing that it's so "easy to learn, hard to master". Very good mechanics of the game, but no theme at all.

Have probably played this hundreds of times by now. Remember having "Dominion days" in university with my friends, where we would play for hours.

Only played the 2-player variant so far. The introductory set up works pretty well. We tried to vary the kingdom cards a little, and it seems quite easy to destroy the balance of the game if you don't know the cards well.

I admit its appeal is creeping up on me.  Still, I find that with the randomness of how synergistic cards are likely to come up together, the game has superficially meaty mechanics but is ultimately a little light.  I'm not convinced that the variety of action choices are that varied and interesting.  But I do have fun with it.

My wife calls it the "brown game" and still refuses to play it, despite the fact that there is yet a person I have introduced the game to that didn't love it.  So much diversity is presented in the base game that you really could only play with that and be happy for the rest of your days, but with the expansions, this becomes the most replayable game I have every played.  It's incredible how the value and percieved use of a card can change so much depending on what other kingdom cards are being played with.

Update:Dropped rating by 1 point

I still like Dominion but it’s losing its flare.  While the different kingdom cards change things up a bit, as a whole they feel like more of the same.  Perhaps the real catalyst is Glory to Rome. Still will always play if given the chance.

UPDATE: Deck building has become a much overused mechanic since Dominion put it center stage. I don't really like the deck-building genre much it seems that they all feel pretty similar. They just don't inspire me.

This is a good deck-builder but not something that I'm interested in playing anymore. I like Thunderstone Advanced more based on the theme.

================================

This is a great card game! The mechanics are very unique and you are faced with deep strategic decisions which are unlike those in any other game (at least they feel different). 

The main reason being because you buy cards from a general supply that, when purchased, go directly into your discard pile. Each of your turns ends with discarding all cards you played, along with your hand, you then draw a new hand of 5 cards. So there is a strong element of deck building and the construction of the deck takes place each turn when you try to buy something to add to it, but what you buy only helps in the future since it goes into your discard pile. You also buy money this way, a gold treasure has value 3 and costs 6 to buy, but then it's in your deck for the rest of the game and you can use it multiple times to buy other cards.

It's a novel game that demands analysis and forward thinking to do well, and one where the novice player has absolutely no chance of beating an expert player. This will appeal to some people and not to others, but the game design is unquestionably brilliant. I only wish the price point reflected the contents of the over-sized box...

Brilliant. Many strategies available, and they change significantly based on what cards are in play. Building a good deck is a very fine balance.

To borrow a line from ratpfink, "Clearly Dominion is not a game for fun murderers." Yes, it has lots of shuffling. Yes, some cards will wear more than others. Get over it and just enjoy the game. You'll be too engaged to be annoyed by all the shuffling, and uneven wear is an issue only if you're playing with cheaters. Why are you playing with cheaters?

I got to play the final prototype (I think) at Gulf Games with Valerie and Dale.

All I can say is that I went to GG to play Agricola but after I tried this once, I was hooked and never played Agricola.  I think I played around 12 to 14 times over the weekend.

The game is truly amazing and I would be suprised if it was not a total hit at Essen.  From talking to Dale and Valerie, it sounds like there are a ton of new cards planned for future expansions which is only going to make the game that much more enjoyabled (I did play with some of the expansion cards which seems to add some complexity to the game).

I have seen comments about how people say this is a solitare type game/not enough interaction but they obviously have not played some of the cards since Dale and Valerie set a game up and played with me where where the whole game was about interaction (tons of cards swapping and stealing).  

Throw a thief (potential to steal money), spy (able to check the top card of all decks and either discard or keep on top), another card (can't remember card name) where you pass a card to the left (and the person who played the card the ability to trash a card) and a witch card (not sure of all the powers but one is everyone but you gets a curse card (-1 VPs) and you will have a ton of interaction.  

The beauty of this game is that you tailor it to what you want with the 10 cards you decide to use in your game!

I usually don't rate games a 10 but this game really grabbed me and is a must preorder!!!

As testament to the replayability, we've had over a dozen plays, and I still don't think we've made it through all the different decks in the box. Games are fast, and the mechanics are simple, leading to repeated plays. With the prospect of a plethora of expansions to explore as well, Dominion will likely remain a favourite within our collection for some time to come.

RATING: 9.5
100+ plays.

+ Incredible replay value.  Games can be a race or a slog, aggressive or peaceful, simple or complex.  In some games straightforward strategies can be the best, but in many others intricate combinations can be even better.
+ Solid metagame.  Worthy of quantitative analysis.  Can be played at a very high level.
+ Satisfying mega-turns.

- Forgettable theme
- Randomness (card drawing)
- Nothing to do on opponent's turn.  Can feel solitare-esqe.

Ok, finally 6/10. It's just not enjoyable with too big experience differences. Some of the cards just stress me out and I don't want to use them (throne room, witch). To quote another BGG member: "If I have to sit through another turn where my opponent spends five minutes chaining together a dozen actions only to buy another action which will let him chain even more actions on his next turn, I will probably shoot myself."
---
What a forth and back! It's 8/10 again after having discovered that my girlfriend enjoys it and getting in more plays within a short timeframe. 
---
After playing this FTF once with a guy having played this a lot on Brettspielwelt, I downgraded my rating again. Different experience levels matter too much. My girlfriend didn't enjoy the game on her single play for the very same reason. I wouldn't turn down a game of Dominion with equally skilled players but I probably will turn down playing with BSW guys.
---
It is growing on me and I upgraded my rating to 8/10 after 6 plays. I enjoy this more than last year's hype game RFTG. While it shares the engine building principle, this one's far more accessible, plays quicker and player interaction is more tangible. It doesn't bother me as much here if other players play their cards right. It's easier to follow their moves and understand what they are doing. I could imagine playing this with gaming newbies what I couldn't imagine for RFTG.
---
Very innovative game. I was out of the running after one third of my first game and this will happen to some players in each round if they are not really experienced. Strategy dominates tactics. While the mechanism sounds confusing first the gameplay is very straight forward. This needs a few plays to grow on me... or not.

Awesome and fun game, even for me (I've avoided CCG's). I think it makes the CCG format accessible to everyone. However, the game is deceptively tedious to teach. I told my buddies it would take an hour for their first game, and it ended up taking four hours. Sooo many questions. Advice: for your first game, don't worry about being competitive, just explore the effects of the cards.

Another gateway game. I was hooked on this game (like many other people) for some time and basically mastered it, to the point where I was winning 10+ games in a row in every group I played with. In a way, it was one of my first exposures to the world of board and card gaming. But after that, it got a bit stale. I am happy to play it when the rest of the group wants to, but it is quite far down the list in terms of personal preference.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The fun of CCG deck-tuning without buying all the cards. Player interaction can be light, but it really depends on the selection of cards and how players approach the game. Unfortunately, the more I play this one, the less I enjoy it. The card selection creates combos that are predictable and oftentimes the best strategy is to ignore all the cards and focus on money. A good concept, but a flawed design.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Game is very simple and easy to learn. I watched a 3 minute YouTube video then read the directions. Total time spent was around 10 minutes and then it was off to play. The game is very simple and turns are very fast keeping everyone involved. Although the game is simple it actually has an incredible amount of strategy and depth. I can see plenty of value in the base set alone and with the expansions I can see almost infinite possibilities and almost unlimited play.

Played this game wayyyyy too much. I fell in love because of the different combinations of cards. It's a great game and nearly everyone I've introduced it to has fallen in love with it. I probably played 30 to 40 times within the first few weeks of getting it, which was fun, but we exhausted the card combinations pretty quickly. I'm looking forward to getting Thunderstone and Dominion: Intrigue.

RATING: 5
Rating with about 25 plays:  

The 6.5 rating is going to make people think I don't like this game much when I actually do.  I bought it on release day and don't regret it for a minute.  I really love the deckbuilding mechanic it's certainly a game I've never played the like of before. 

So why the lowish rating?  

I'm concerned that this game is such a one-trick pony that the variety of cards isn't going to be enough to make it something I want to play a year from now.  I'm also concerned that despite the card variability, the number of viable strategies is actually going to be pretty limited once I've had time to explore the game.  In the first 25 plays attempts to focus strategy rather than building a diverse deck have usually ended disastrously.  This may be due to inexperience...  or not.  

Ultimately, despite the fact that I haven't had the game long, I can already think of a handful of games in my collection that I'd rather play because of the interesting gameplay variety they provide, and that's not really a good sign regarding Dominion's longevity.

Update:  7-2009

I've now played the game once since December 2008.  Every time I walk in my game room to choose a game for play my eyes linger on Dominion for a moment, then I move on.  That alone speaks volumes.  Dropping rating to a 5.

My personal gateway into the world of board games: the first, and still the best, deck building game. The theme is totally detached from the mechanics, but the game plays so smoothly and variety between games is so immense that it is an easy flaw to overlook.

Dominion is commonly cited as being a "multiplayer solitaire" game. While I would not argue that Dominion is lighter on player interaction than many other games, there are definite subtleties in how to respond to an opponents buying patterns that expert players will take advantage of.

The unbelievable amount of hype/buzz for this game prepared me to be disappointed, but so far I really enjoy this game.  The quick play time and large amount of replayability are huge assets.  There is just the right amount of luck, but skill seems to play a big enough role that the better player should win most of the time.  The theme is, like many releases, ridiculously pasted on, but when the mechanisms are so compelling, who cares?

Update, July 2013: Now that the initial wave of expansions has concluded, there is no denying that Dominion is one of the greatest games created, nearly always full of delicious decisions and endless variety. Up to a 10. This 10 is for the game system/family, not necessarily for just the base set alone.

There are many deck builder games out there, Dominion is arguably the first to do it well, but there have been many other deck builders to come out since Dominion's debut.  Some are complete knock offs, but still good.  Some have found their own niche.  Some are just superior in every way.

For me, Dominion is clunky and slow.  And since there are several other deck builders that I like a while lot more, so I'll never play Dominion again.

[Update] Subsequent playings have improved my view of the game. I think I was originally underwhelmed because of my high expectations (due to the hype on BGG).

This game uses a somewhat unique idea of building a deck of cards on the fly. Its a bit long to be a filler, but because the turns are quick, there is little downtime. My main complaint is that the strategy aspect is pretty low. Players cannot really have a grand plan for a deck theme (which is typical of deck-building), because of the various random elements and because card choices are limited and shared by all players.

And I hate that most Kingdom decks (which are supposed to provide replayability) only add Actions or Buys or Cards in varying degrees. No special rule cards that can really be combo-ed to make powerful decks.

Which superlatives haven't been used for this game?

Well I'm not sure but I'm certain it deserves a large number of those that have been attributed to it. I find it to be deep given the length of play, novel given recent publications and hugely replayable if you're the right type of gamer. I'm loving it and can see it improving with more expansions.

The detractions. Box size, shuffling, non-standard card size and setup time. These certainly don't detract enough from the game to make this a bad purchase.

This game goes pretty quickly, if every player knows what he is doing and if everyone pays attention. The aim is to collect victory points, however these cards are totally useless until the end of the game and simply clog your hand. So having too much of them too early is certainly a drawback. Moreover, while building the deck you must keep the right balance between Treasure and Action cards.

Šis žaidimas yra pakankamai greitas, jei visi žaidėjai žino, ką jie daro, ir jei visų dėmesys į jį sukauptas. Žaidimo tikslas - surinkti kuo daugiau pergalės taškų, tačiau iki žaidimo pabaigos šios kortelės yra visiškai bevertės ir tik užima vietą rankoje. Taigi, prisipirkti jų per daug ir per anksti nepatartina. Be to, renkant savo kortų kaladę reikia išlaikyti tinkamą Treasure ir Action kortelių santykį.

Only played base game... some random card choices make the game extremely weird and low scoring, while others allow you to almost bypass the action cards entirely.  Fair amount of luck involved in your deck shuffles if opponents get their golds and silvers to come together and you never can to buy the best VP cards, or if their action chaining cards come together and yours don't, you can lose making the same moves because of the shuffle... is ok when you're in the mood for card randomness + strategy of deckbuilding.

Classic solid deck building game. Played this so much back in my college days.. too much in fact, that I think the base game lacks variability now. Expansions will greatly improve the base game. Still down to play but I feel that I know the best strategies from the base game already

A game for retired Magic-players. Almost too easy to learn, but offers a lot of differing setups and therefore a lot of possibilities for gaming without becoming dull. Game length isn't luckily that long as during a play it might become boring, as it may happen, that you can quite early see who's winning in the end. This offers a nice and compact package for some nice drafting, but a main problem with having just the vanilla Dominion is that it's a mere tutorial for the actual Dominion experience. Without expansions my rating would probably be 8-9.

My only problem at this point is Dominion has ran its course with me - I mean the attacks cards are hardly fun anymore. Making a concise fun deck of cards with all the expansions is pretty unwieldy... It is a great game, but I have very little reason to care to play this anymore.

I don't understand the popularity of this game.  It feels very solitaire to me with minimal strategy.  Decisions just don't feel that important to me.  I feel like I have nothing to do or think about during other players turns.  Just very minimal appeal to me.

RATING: 8
Large variety of strategies, a different layout essentially every time you play, good depth, and easy to teach are the reasons I gave this a high rating.  I love teaching this to new players and watch them look at each card whispering "cooool" when reading the card details.  Inevitably, the second play those players refine their purchases to only a couple cards and immediately have a stronger strategy.  This game has a nice "one more round" factor for us too, which leads to many late nights.

Playing this game is nothing like playing, collecting or building decks for Magic: the Gathering, and people who say it is are assuredly not Magic players. This is a sort of economic engine game that may play out as multiplayer solitaire depending on the random selection of featured cards (apparently it has a theme of expansionism and even conflict but in any given game this may be complete bullshit). Gameplay is well-oiled but repetitive and seemingly heavily influenced by luck, although knowing when to switch from engine building to VP gathering obviously plays a large part.

After playing again with different cards (but still little meaningful interaction), and doing much better, I can see the attraction clearer, although this still leaves me with no great urge to return.

Initial rating 6 - 1st play: It's very simple - so simple I had a hard time at first wrapping my head around it thinking "that's it?" The game was called many times "brainless" you do your move which is fast and move on. If you like your turn to come around quickly then you should like this - 30sec to 1:30 and it will be your turn again. 

It's very much and engine building VP game. I don't mid the game - it's not my particular must have either. Though I must say this could be a great "gateway" game.

Oct 27/16 - Rerated to a 4. This game has seen it's heyday. Time to put it out to pasture. Boring... I would much rather teach a new player Vegas Showdown, Ticket to Ride, or Catan.

I like this game. It's not so dependent on luck as RFtG, but it's harder to adapt if things hit the fan. The variety in the Kingdom-card-combos give a long lifetime to this piece of art. The playtime can be really short, when there are only seasoned veterans involved. And I don't mind the shuffling. My only real complaint is the cardsize. Hard to find proper sleeves for this sucker. I wonder though, after how many plays will this game hit the auto-pilot-mode? Experienced players will make the same decisions as they get to know the cards, so the only way to have a winner is purely determined by the amount of luck involved. Good game anyways. Feels fresh.

It's a good game but honestly, move on already. There are better games out there. Nostalgia/'respect for your elders' is all good and well but dominion isn't [i]that[/i] good a game either.

If you like Cyberpunk then I'd recommend switching to Shadowrun Crossfire. That game feels very similar. It is lacking content though, especially when compared to a behemoth like Dominion.

How this is currently the #7 game on BGG is beyond me. It's not awful, but it's not that fun, either. There should be bigger choices than whether you buy a victory point or a bigger denomination of money. Maybe I need to play with different cards. So far, I find this pretty charmless.

I suspect it might be better with more players - it'd make the attack cards a lot more powerful.

Edit: Played again. Terrible.

There's the Dominion "system" (domain?) or whatever you want to call it, and the Dominion base game.  This rating is for the system, i.e. the Dominion base set mixed with cards from other expansions.  I would give JUST the base set cards a rating of 7 or 8.  They are great for learning the game, and I am definitely glad I started out with it, as it was one of my first modern boardgames, and my wife and I had never played a deckbuilding game before.  But ultimately, the base game cards are just not as interesting and fun to play compared with the expansions, there are more "dud" cards that almost never get bought, and if you are only playing with the base set, even with all the possible permutations of kingdoms, you start to see card combos more frequently that dominate any given board (e.g. workshop and gardens).  

Update:  I have not played the 2nd edition, but it seems like some of the cards were tweaked/changed in response to some of the criticisms like the ones I made above.

Based on 70+ plays on BSW and 4 face-to-face.  I think the deck-building mechanism is brilliant, although the decisions aren't all that exciting (usually the only trying one is what to buy).  That being said, it has an addictive quality.  And at 5-20 minutes a game on BSW, it's hard to resist.  I don't think I'd play it in person, though.

RATING: 8
The start of deckbuilders (at least the mainstream ones) is this one and it is for a reason. The game is pure, your goal is to get estates and provinces but the appeal of it is you can decide when you will do that. Do you get a lot of actions and try to combo them to get big stuff or do you go money route? When do you start buying point cards? What combos can you pull off this game. I understand why people like this game so much but I just don't see myself getting excited to play this one. The art is horrible and I like it when deckbuilding is not the main focus of the game but just a mechanic. I recommend people trying the game but there have been better deckbuilders that came and Dominion is not the only one in town.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Cardgame with ingenious mechanics - you build your deck while you play.
The cards that are available are different for every game which adds a lot to the replayability and makes different combinations possible in every new
game.
While the mechanis are very innovative I would like gold to be less powerful. Most of the time your best buy is simply more gold. Having more interactions with other players as well as interaction among the action cards would be nice.
However this game has a lot of potential so that I am looking forward to more expansions.
Besides this is finally a game that plays well with geeks but also with my parents!

2014-02-13 - I rated it 9 at first but changed to 8. It's very addictive at first, but after a while you realize that it is a game about buying cards and nothing more. With too many sets of cards the best strategy is to get 8 gold in single hand every turn and that's it.
It's good, but there are better deckbuilders.

2014-09-03 - I lowered the rating to 7. I think that I'm not as big fan of deck builders as I used to be. And Dominion has its flaws mentioned above.

2016-04-04 - 7->6 - Deckbuilders are not my genre and I prefer them sometimes as the mechanism, not the game itself, although I can play it from time to time.

2016-04-24 - 6->7 - After playing quite few of them I finally consider Dominion to be the best of the genre. I don't think I will own it anytime, but I can play it if someone would like to.

2016-10-11 - I bought Dominion! If I want to own a deckbuilder this is one to get.

2016-12-29 - I'm getting rid of Dominion! I like this game but I found that I really don't like to own it (and I guess it's the first such case), because of need of carrying a lot of heavy boxes with cards, then selecting right decks for the game. I prefer just sit at the table with Dominion ready and play it. I don't feel that way to any other game I own.

Stopped playing this for a couple of years for no reason and set up a game just last week. We've now played 4 or 5 games since then. The only disadvantage of the game is the setup time compared to the play time. When I'd stopped playing for a while, I assumed that the reason we played multiple games in a row like that was to offset the long setup time. But now I remember what I knew then — it's just fun and satisfying. Dominion is one of those games where it's hard/you have limited options in the beginning, and then through your work and planning you are able to accomplish more as time goes on. That's a psychologically pleasing sequence of events. (Feels to me like the opposite of how I feel when I play Agricola.) [thing=37380][/thing] and [thing=8217][/thing] follow that same satisfying path.

The lack of feasible trash mechanic in the base game, and heavy weighting to the draw mechanic, makes the game take significantly longer than it should. This is especially bad given there is very little player interaction.

Great game.  Better than Ascension, though Ascension is still good.  30 minute play time is a blatent lie.  I played SOLO against myself in a speed match and it took 51 minutes.  NO way you shave 21 minutes off of that with 2 people who actually care if they win.  Otherwise, great game.  Possibility to be one of my Favorites.  Great Job Rio Grande!

It's unlikely you haven't heard of this one and there's a good reason for that. It's a fun game but, for us anyway, is growing a little stale without any of the expansions. Will likely pick some up later. Being able to pick different sets of cards for each game allows for good replayability.

Only played on BSW so far, but I have about 30 games under my belt with a variety of different kingdom card configurations.

I like it!  It does have a lot of MTG elements I can enjoy without the time and money problems.

There does seem to be some imbalance with villages, as having a large number of villages often corresponds to winning, but this isn't true every time.

My other observation is that the victory point system feels a little clunky.  I didn't design or playtest the game, so this concept might be completely unreasonable, but I think it would be interesting if each card had it's own VP value in addition to it's action.  This would solve two problems.  First, it's very easy to keep track of how many victory points everyone has.  In some games you know about halfway through that you're going to lose, and in many of them it's just a race for the provinces.  Second, it would add more tension to each decision, as your deck's final value is constantly changing (you could even have powerful actions with negative VP points).  I still think there would be room for VP only cards that net you a large amount of points similar to the "big buildings" in Puerto Rico.

On the other hand, this would generally mean larger decks are always better, while in the current rules you can end up with efficiently Chapeled decks that win with something like 15 cards.

In any case, I think this is a solid addition to my collection as it has a lot of replay value (much like Ra).

I can easily see why it's so popular. Very interesting game with lots of possibilities due to randomization of the available cards. I currently want to keep playing it constantly!

Edit: I just changed my score back up to a 9 after playing more. I began to realize that there usually ARE multiple answers to different strategies (duplicating, avoiding and combating are all often options you can make) and that brings the game back up for me. I absolutely love it.

Edit: Back to a 8.5. Very fun, still love it but it is losing my interest in ways that Race, Tigris, and Ra don't.

Edit: And down to 7, too many others in the space now

There is some fun in this game, so I rate it a 7.  But really, the fun lies in getting buildings and seeing what cool combos you can manage.  I just can't shake the feeling that all you need to do to win the game is ignore all the buildings and just collect silver, then gold.  Eventually, you'll be able to buy provinces well before your opponents.  But what fun is that?

Update: December 2011.  Really enjoy this with the cards from Intrigue.  Now that I've got more games under my belt, I understand the combos and the need to change strategies depending on which cards are in play.

Update based on play with my 9 year old son.  He picked up the rules pretty quickly and wants to play again with different cards. He's already understanding the way some cards work together and the need to balance between action, treasure and vp cards.

Initial rating based on solo play to learn rules.  This looks like it would be a lot of fun with 3 or 4 players, as there are many different strategies to pursue.  This is my type of game, building an economic engine that you turn into victory points.

(7.0) Solo jugado 1 vez, me parece un buen juego. Mecánica original (ir formando  y retroalimentando tu mazo de cartas con el propio mazo) y bastante rejugable, gracias al diverso numero de mazos (ampliaciones a la vista!). Ya que jugué con el mazo startup para principiantes había poco interactividad entre jugadores, pero parece que hay más mazos que solucionan este "problema", ya que si no se convierte en un poco solitario. Quiero jugar alguna partida más para refinar mi nota.
--
(8.0) Con alguna partida más jugada, le subo la nota a 8, ya que el juego se vuelve adictivo y no se quema tras varias partidas. Quizás le falte algo de "alma", es decir que te involucre un poco en el juego, pero al ser tan entretenido y rápido de jugar no se echa de menos ese defecto. El único defecto que le sigo viendo es la poca interaacion que hay con el resto de jugadores.

I love this game.  Starts slow, but when you get a particularly good hand it just feels so damn rewarding.  It lacks much interaction between players, which is a bit of a downside for some, but it's a good example of a game in which early decisions really pay off later in spectacular ways.

The play of the cards is not fun; pointless, dull and does nothing for me.  I'd rather play that old card game I played as a kid called War.  After playing this I'm really shocked at all the hype this is getting.  Only the poor descriptive explanations of the BGG rating system saves this from being rated a 1 (i.e. it would be difficult to call this broken given the number of people that actually enjoy it).

A game that I anxiously awaited, then dismissed for a while, then got anxious about again.  As an old time Magic player and current casual Magic player, I see very few similarities between this game and Magic, particularly not in deckbuilding or drafting.

A Dominiontól egészen egyszerűen leesett az állam. Mindenféleképpen be akartam szerezni a játékot, de valami miatt óvakodtam attól, hogy rögtön kipróbáljuk. Azt hiszem, hogy az ilyen jellegű kártyajátékoknál megszoktam, hogy hosszabb játékidejűek, és bizony a szabályok elsajátítása is általában nem pár perc. Aztán amikor végigolvastam a szabálykönyvet, azonnal kikészítettem a paklikat, pár mondatban összefoglaltam a szabályokat Anettnek, és már el is kezdtük a játékot. ANNYIRA jó volt az első játék, hogy RÖGTÖN, ahogyan befejeztük, kezdtük is a következőt. Azért ilyen nem sokszor szokott előfordulni és nem csak a kevés idő, meg a fáradtság miatt, hanem általában egy-egy parti után nem érzem én sem, meg Anett sem, hogy abban a pillanatban ugyanazt újra szeretnénk játszani. Szerintem ez sokat elárul a Dominionról. Kártyajáték, de mégis kevés szerepe van a szerencsének, nagyon kiegyenlített. Mindenki ugyanazokkal a lapokkal indul, mindenki ugyanazokból a lapokból vásárolhat, és mindenki eldöntheti, hogy pár körön belül milyen lesz a paklijának az összetétele. Zseniális. 
A dobozban pedig eléggé szép mennyiségű lap található, ami nagyon magas újrajátszhatóságot biztosít. Ez a második játék Donald X. Vaccarino szerzeményei közül, amivel játszottam (a másik a Kingdom Builder volt), de mind a kettő megalkotásánál fontos szempont lehetett, hogy nagyon sokszor lehessen velük játszani úgy, hogy mindig hozzá lehessen tenni valami újat (és most nem a kiegészítőkről beszélek, mert maga az alapjáték ilyen).

Basic game is fine but with minimal player interaction, and the additional cards add the kind of passive/aggressive elements of competition that I don't like.

A fine game with much variability and easy to see why it could get so many replays, it still can't hold a candle to so many other multi-player options...I just have a strong preference for games that have a narrative.    It is pretty fast, though.

Imagine you're on a game show where every player is given ten random ingredients and challenged to cook up the best dish. You choose your ingredients and their proportions carefully and season to taste, and if it tastes like barf -- oh well, you only spent 20 minutes on it, so just have another go at it!

Dominion is just like that. I love the feeling of building the perfect little recipe for any situation.

It's easy to learn and easy to play (contrast: Race), but the more you might feel like studying the cards and how they work together, the deeper your experience becomes.

It really is that good!  In fact, it kinda ruined my enjoyment of every other game I own for a long year.

I have played this game, literally, hundreds of times, and I still am not sated. Is it that great? Well, objectively, maybe not, but it really suits me. The deck-building takes me back to the joys of Magic: The Gathering before I had so many cards that constructing and deconstructing decks became a massive chore. The build-the-most-efficient engine aspect appeals to the perfectionist in me. The quick play time really appeals to, and the sheer variety that you can get out of, really, not that many different cards is surprising. Almost loses half a point for the endless shuffling, but since that doesn't deter me, I'm keeping this a 10.

It took a long time, but a Dominion game finally emerged for me to give it a try.  Okay game, I'd play again.  Clever how the game can be built with different cards to suit your taste.

It didn't wow me, but I did have some fun.  Not enough to spur me to go buy it, but I wouldn't turn down another game if it emerged nearby.  But then, I probably won't request it either.

Bought Swedish edition on 110104.

Ang. den svenska utgåvan:

Den svenska kortet Spion (Spy) nämner inte att det är spelaren av kortet som bestämmer om de andra spelarna skall lägga tillbaka eller kasta kortet de visar upp. Tyvärr står det heller inte i reglerna. 

Valet av översättningen "ta upp ett kort" för "gain a card" är kanske inte den bästa heller... men det klargörs tydligt i reglerna att det nya kortet inte får tas upp på handen om det inte explicit sägs så. 

Dessutom är samtliga Hertigdöme-kort feltryckta, det står "Hertigöme" på dem, trist. 

Annars en solid utgåva som funkar bra att kombinera med utländska expansioner. Tack för det!

For me, the thing with Dominion is identifying -- as well as actually managing to follow through with -- a strategy that will make use of the available cards to gain victory points quicker or more efficiently than my opponents. 

The fun thing is that we all start out with the same resources (the cards), but choose to utilise them in different ways to achieve that goal. Also, you may get to mess with your opponents' strategies sometimes.

Dominion also scratches the CCG "deckbuilding" & hand optimising itch inside a manageable and closed card set environment. That's a plus for me.

Dominion was the best Deck Builder when it was the only Deck Builder.  Pretty much anything else I find more enjoyable now, particularly the reworked Thunderstone Advance (Which looks like it might be reworked yet again).  A Dominion base set might still be good for introducing someone new to Deck Building, just as it was for all of us but I'd probably still skip it and pick something with more theme (Trains?).

Definitely my favourite board game. I love the variety and the simplicity of the mechanics, and I enjoy shuffling cards, which helps because this game has a ton of card shuffling. This is an easy game to teach how to play, which is a huge boon. I'm always looking for more games that play well with non-gaming enthusiasts.

I think you really need at least one expansion to get the most out of Dominion as it massively improves the variety. Having said that, I've played hundreds of base-game only games against AI on the free Android app and I'm not bored of it yet, although I much prefer playing against real people with the physical cards.

It does take a couple of games (2-5 Random Kingdom) to actually see why this game is amazing. First couple of games take an hour to complete, after that games will start to take 15-30 min.

Once you mix Intrigue kingdom cards with the basic set it feels almost exactly like Magic the Gathering.

Obviously a cool and clever idea, or it would not have taken off like it did, and have so many fans.  There's just not much of a flow, and surprisingly little hook in the theme for me.  It's about spotting combos, getting them, and putting them to work.  There is usually a "best" combo on any table, which means that if everyone is good (and not stubbornly non-conformist), it's basically a race game, with card-based luck (kind of like Candyland).

I gave up Dominion Intrigue and got the base game, but eventually purged that, as well. I think the cards of the base game work well. The do exactly what's needed, which is to interact so that players can pursue diverse strategies to create their point-scoring engines. There is a bit of that "this is a mechanic without a game" feel to it, but that's acceptable for multiplayer solitaire. I like Dominion as a gateway game, but it's not satisfying beyond that. Exploring the different options always loses when an experienced player is at the table.

Until recently I would have given the game a 6 or 7, but then I played it some more with my wife and suddenly it got the pace I was missing the first and second time I played it.

Once I unfortunately played it with a person who just couldn't get the grip of the mechanics. Hence the game dragged on way too long. 

Played with the right people - it's really good as a 2-player game - it becomes really entertaining. That means I now need to buy some expansions.

RATING: 8
After one play, I see already tons of strategies and things to try in the next games and this is barely scratching the surface with all the kingdoms cards I haven't even seen yet the other ones, not to mention the expansion... It plays fast, which is something really good.

So far, the game seems to be really light on player interaction but perhaps it's solved with the other cards. I can also see that you can force a strategy, so even if you have lots of possibility, you might end up with a similar strategy often to win. This is unlike Race of the Galaxy where you have to deal with the cards you randomly get and you have to figure out how to best play them to get more points.

A new and unusual game system. I like it especially with 2 players; then it`s mostly a very tight race to victory. Good timing when to buy victory points is immensely important. Lacks a bit of interaction, so it´s a solid 8 for me. And who is Donald Vaccarino?

The perfect gateway game.  There's not much more to say about it.  It's great for the hardcore strategy gamer, and the light gamer.  The only disappointed parties is people who want more interaction.  But that's exactly what's great about this game.  You play your own game, and try to do the best, rather than tearing down someone who's doing better.

This was one of my go to games when I first joined the hobby, but as I began to pick-up new games it just never seemed to hit the table.

I had picked up expansions whenever I found them on clearance, but they remained on the shelf unopened.  

Recently I have made a push to get this played several times and remembered why I liked it so much.  The gameplay is simple and for the most part has been easy to teach others.  Also it plays well with two players which is typically what I play.

I don't play many deckbuilders,but this remains my favorite.

I read the forums on this one before I played it and I'd have to agree that the game probably is designed for the Ralph Wiggum crowd.  Er um, sorry; the "marketing and sales crowd".  It seems a bit limited in value to me ... but then I've only played twice.  Here's my take; if the goal of the game is to acquire Duchies and Provinces, and those are purchased via Gold, and you can upgrade Coppers to Silvers and Gold; then why not focus on just those?  Concentrate on getting more cards drawn so that you have a greater change of getting coin cards.  And then purchase Silver and Gold if you can't afford a Province.  Seems simple enough and it worked for me.  But again ... I've only played twice.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Fun, if a bit dry in the base set.  Needed more mechanics which were added in the expansions.  Can end up feeling a lot like solitare if the cards aren't terribly interactive (i.e. without any attack cards).  You just sort of optimize, and if your path doesn't cross over with your opponents path, you don't really do anything except try and buy the best victory cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
one of the progenitor card drafting games.  It is hard to argue against it as it is one of the originals to bring the mechanism to place but at the same time, while I recognize the importance of the game (and still own it), I find myself less interested in playing it any longer in favor of other card drafters.

If others were to bring it to table I would still play it but now-a-days, I prefer either more theme to my deck builders or else co-op deck builders which I can play with my GF, so see it brought to the table more often.

RATING: 8
I going to give it a 7. It will probably go to 8. Why? Because, I feel there is a great game there, but I am just not quite managing to link the cards together to form perfect or even great strategies. I am on the edge, sort of working out what works well with what. But, not quite getting it.
Only ever played with 2, only won 2 games out of about 8, but getting closer in the points.

Unique game where you build your playing deck as you go.
I've really only played the base setup and a couple of variants, so I think there is a lot of play without even getting in to the expansions.  Moves pretty quick once players get past their first game.  Too bad the base game doesn't play more than 4 players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Dominion is such a good game allround.  Yes there are games which have far more interaction that Dominion but few, if any, which have the depth of tactics and variety of scenarios as this!

Even with just the base set there are 25 different types of cards and so with only using 10 at a time this means for a lot of combos.  Even if you did play the same combo in a row you could play that same combo in numerous different ways.

Dominion just has such great longevity.  I could play it many times in a row without feeling like i had exhuasted its potential.

I would give it 10 if it had more interaction between players but this can to a small degree be remedied by some of the expansions.

I haven't played a better game and i have played A LOT!

Dominion introduces a clever twist on card games that is really unique: each player starts with an identical very small deck of cards and they can each customize their deck on the fly while playing (during the course of the game they can 'buy' additional cards for their deck). 

This game is very easy to learn, pretty quick, enjoyable for almost anyone and incredibly addictive.

RATING: 9
Trying to ignore the hype, I tried to give it a shot on its own merits, and found a game that truly distills a CCG experience down to a 30-40 minute game, from buying to deck building to playing against the other players, it's quite impressive and addictive. My only worry is that the cards used for every game (Treasure and Victory) will get marked soon due to the incredible amounts of shuffling.

Similar to MTG in the sense that there is enough variance in the game to keep all types of players entertained and competitive.

There was a time when deck building was restricted to CCGs. A time when very few games integrated deck building as a core mechanic of the gaming session itself. Then Dominion made its appearance, making deck building mainstream. 

At its core, the game is simple: on your first turn you study the cards, picture what combination you think will be effective, and then designing a master plan revolving around it. You will spend the first half of the game building your killer combo, following your strategy as best as you can. Once you reach the latter half all players plans will unravel, so you'll figure out if whatever you came up with was a good idea after all.

The base game has two main flaws. First, card variety: the number of possible tactics and strategies are quite limited if you restrict yourself to the cards included in it. This is fixed with expansions, though your wallet may not be pleased.

Secondly, it is the definition of "multiplayer solitaire". There are cards labelled "attacks", which actually offer direct interaction in between players, yet most of these are as uninteresting as they are unnecessary. The only cards which truly affects other players plans are those which add "curse" cards. Whenever a "curse" card enters the pool, viable tactics and strategies are reduced tremendously, as curses are stupidly powerful. Considering what makes the game interesting is goofing around with the potential combinations, curses hamper the overall experience badly.

Dominion is best played with two or three players, as the game is virtually the same with any number. More players simply increases downtime. Add a fourth player and the game borderlines the unplayable. Expansions allow more players, but playing more than four simply makes the game drag forever.

Funny enough, the base set is more balanced when played in combination with other expansions rather than on its own. At least it's easier to teach and learn than other expansions, so it still makes for a good starting point.

At first view a nice gameplay idea. But it's a bit to abstract - the cards could refer to any other historical background, it's really a pasted theme. 

And there are really many, many action cards that don´t work well, but others are real game breaker cards. The combination of two or three out of the 25 action cards, and then mainly focussing on Gold-cards and Province-cards makes the game. It´s a real simple math. In other words: There is only little possibility to change winning strategies, which makes the game only "5" in our gaming group's opinion - after some plays you know, what cards to combine (that are very few) and which ones aren´t worth anything. 

And beside this: Nearly no player interaction - there are some action cards that steal cards from other players or give them negative points - but in general there is nearly no interaction. And because of this the downtime with four players is a pain in the...

I need to play this a few more times before locking in a score. 
I can see whats good about the game but it feels as though some of the combos of cards become really convoluted and tedious to resolve and the constant shuffeling is also a problem. 

Also I'm not quite clear yet whether this is more skill or luck based but I'm leaning towards the latter.

if a game is called dominion, i expect to dominate and conquer. Instead it's a constant fussing over card x vs card y, and there is no sense of progress. 
Also, it's too many cards, takes too long to set up, viewing your options at your turn takes a lot of effort. It's more like pokemon the card game squared.

I initially REALLY enjoyed this game and probably played it more in the month-post-purchase than any other game. This was aided by the very quick setup and playtime and the ease with which one could teach, and play, this game with others.

I've found that since the discovery of a handful of optimum strategies the enjoyment of this game has dropped "big gold again, huh".

One day I'll buy an expansion for this game, I get the feeling it'll improve substantially as a consequence; although, for the time being I'm far too happy purchasing other new games... so we'll have to wait and see if this gets resurrected.

A fun, light deck building game. Concept is easy - most VP- and the rules can be explained in 10 minutes. The quality of the cards as so-so. After about 2 years of playing there are many cards with torn or frayed corners and I am too lazy to put them in sleeves. 

The actual theme of the game is almost non-existent, but if you play with the right people, that doesn't matter.

I find my self drawn to its simplicity over time.

Easy to teach, very inclusive, fast to setup and fast to play.  Allows for great tactics, and multiple kingdom card combos allow for replayability.

Love the mechanic where everyone has the same actions as another player until the very end. No one is left behind in the gameplay.

EDIT: I still play this game to check if it should be a 10 and I still go back to playing vanilla Dominion.  I have yet to say no to a game. 

15Jan2010 : Yup still a "10"
08May2010 : Still a 10 in my collection. 
02Jan2011 : Still a 10, one of the few things fighting off my WoW addiction.
13Nov2011 : said no to my first game of Dominion.  SO reduced it to a 9.5.  I didn't want to rummage through 4 boxes to find cards we wanted to use.

Oh my, this game is awesome. On-the-fly deckbuilding, competition for resources, a speed-race to buy up cool stuff, it has it all. Many ways to victory, excellently balanced play with 2-4 players, clear simple game mechanics that produce a new rich environment every game.

I cannot think of anything relevant to criticize, maybe just the fact that some of the card stacks do not fit in their slots if you add even thin sleeves; but man, with the amount of play my copy is bound to see one has to protect the cards.

Right now, I always want to play, and will not turn down a game.  I suspect this game will move down to an 8 eventually, sometime after the Dominion: Intrigue expansion has been played a few dozen times, and the novelty of that has worn off.  

Until then, though, this game is astonishingly clever (the deck-building mechanic is original and refreshing, and the game plays relatively quickly, esp. online), so I have a lot of FUN while playing it.

As an avid Magic player I can tell you, this game isn't really like Magic at all. However, the concept of building a deck, and playing from it is something that many Magic players may be interested in. I personally think it is a very unique component and original game play. I love how the box comes with many different "included expansions" so that the game is not repetitive each time. I do think they will need to release some more expansions or risk the game possibly getting dull in the future. Until then though, this game get's a very high score from me.

RATING: 9
A quick cardgame.  That is ever changing and with modest amounts of strategy.  Each strategy changes and depends on what others select as you aquire your attack, point, purchase, and defense deck... which is randomly shuffled out each time. Has some random element depending on the shuffle.  But everything gets played in the end.  
Lots of attack and defense play.  Very interactive.  No specific targeting of one player, everyone gets it if it gets played, so low arguments.  
A staple at the gaming party to even out game ending times to shuffle players around for longer games, or over lunch (sticky card deck).

I want to like Dominion alot more than I do, but it usually grates on me by the time its over. Some card combinations will just suck, and alot of the big-card combos are boring to watch and execute. Its an excellent gateway game and I should have kept it for that reason, I could be playing it instead of Ticket to Ride.

The king of deck builders!  This is a very well designed game, and with expansions, has nearly infinite replayability.  There is no theme, so it can be a bit dry.

I thought that the "deck building" aspect was a drafting process and the 500 cards were unique. Luckily, neither of these were the case. The game is extremely simple, and the luck element is surprisingly small. However, this game lacks the satisfaction of watching your empire grow. Sure, the deck gets bigger, but the cards are all face-down. Erecting a permanent building or watching you develop fields and roads is part of the fun of a building/development game.

My rating on this game continues to change as I play it more and more. My favourite card game, it's got a surprising amount of depth to it. My only issue is that it won't be long before I'm slightly bored of the current 25 districts I own in the base game, and it's off-putting having the shell out the same price again for the expansions.

RATING: 8
A deck-building card game where you compete to get the most Victory Point cards in your deck.  You build your deck using any of the 16 (maybe 17) available Kingdom Cards which you purchase using Treasure cards in your deck.  Each game can be a unique experience since you can pick and choose 10 of the Kingdom Cards that will be used.

I don't hate the game, but I don't really like all the shuffling. It's a pretty light and simple game that does lend itself to a lot of variety due to the different deck choices.

I'm sick of this game.  Everybody has it so it's overplayed.  The theme doesn't really add to the game play and after a while the game gets repetitive.  The attack cards are the only means of having any interaction between players, otherwise it's solitaire played in parallel.

I sometimes pull it out if I have friends over that don't play board games regularly but I'm working on filling out my game collection with better games than this that are suited for that.

RATING: 9
The game is pretty light and easy to play, but it may take a couple of games to play well.  There's a good variety of card configurations, but competitive strategies for a given configuration are more constrained than it may seem.

It actually reminds me of To Court the King, where you're using a random element (die rolls vs. a five-card hand) to acquire abilities that manipulate the random element, improving the chances of unlikely or impossible events.  Of course, Dominion seems to have a much broader palette from which to choose, which (for better or worse) is ripe for expansions, but it has a similar feeling of building an engine on top of random events.

The game can take longer than suggested, particularly if cards get distributed suboptimally, but that should definitely improve quickly with experience.  Unfortunately, that same experience may lead to more sameness of play than the variety of cards would imply.

With the shuffling and setup involved, the game lends itself well to online play at BSW.  Games can be quite quick, which can throw slow players into sharp relief.  Quasi-degenerate setups (e.g., workshop/gardens) seem more obvious as well when playing through more games in succession.

RATING: 10
► Best deck-building game.

The game that started the whole deckbuilding craze in the board game community. Many designers and games since then copied or implemented in some way the concept of [b]Dominion[/b]'s deckbuilding mechanism. In terms of a pure deckbuilding game, [b]Dominion[/b] is still the best.

What makes this game so great is the fact that it can be played in various different ways with very different strategies, depending on the stacks of cards you bring to the table during setup and which of these cards you then "buy" and add to your own deck. You will be building your very own personalised engine that you keep expanding and refining.

The game plays [b][i]very[/i][/b] fast once players are familiar with the game's flow and cards. It also works very well with just 2 players - many players even say that the game plays best with just 2.

Fans of [b]Dominion[/b] have almost limitless options, thanks to the countless expansions, each offering more and more cards, resulting in a sheer plethora of options and combinations. Each expansion has a very different focus and they become increasingly complex, so beginners will want to get one of the first-released boxes for their first expansion(s).

The cons: if you don't like shuffling cards, you might dislike [b]Dominion[/b] for that, as you will be shuffling [b][i]a lot[/i][/b] while playing.

The game is also often criticised for having no theme, which never bothered me personally, as the rest of the game is good enough that it does not matter -- and I'm saying this as a player who generally likes thematic games.

Because of this, many players prefer playing [b]Thunderstone[/b], which indeed adds theme and a bit more complexity, but at the same time takes away the very fast-flowing gameplay by doing so - which absolutely killed the fun in [b]Thunderstone[/b] for me personally. In the end, it - again - comes down to personal preference.

Have played this twice so far with two different setups, and it's like playing two different games.  I can tell it's going to be a favorite around here.  Will rate after more plays.

Have played it nine times so far, and while it's a terrific game for short playing time, I'm not sure what I think about it.  We keep doing the same thing in two player, and it's resulting in roughly the same scores every time.  Even when we force ourselves to buy action cards instead of gold or victory points, we do that for a while until the money is strong enough to get victory points, and that's all we do.

One of the best ways to teach deckbuilding but the expansions, unfortunately, are one-off attribute changes so great mechanics aren't expanded on.  Like the prizes in one expansion, or the alchemy symbols in the other, if you aren't dedicating your use to the one expansion there's almost no point in using some of the cards at all.  We don't play this one much anymore.

RATING: 7
Fast-paced, easy to learn, and somewhat luck-based card game that rewards forward thinking and a modicum of card-counting.

The theme of the cards is integrated nicely into the gameplay and the art is well-done.

Light on player interaction, the game plays like competitive deck-drafting. I lowered the score I gave this game because the replay value of the core set of cards is limited and only a few combinations of cards work well together. Choosing randomly often leads to imbalanced play or useless card choices.

[update 2017] oldie but a goodie, but at this point feels dated. I also prefer Tanto Cuore, Barbarossa or Heart of Crowns for the same gameplay but superior art.

We only play this on BSW and I can't see myself buying the game.  It is fun as a fast BSW game with no shuffling  but overall the strategy seems dull to me.  I would rather buy all sorts of cards and have a fun deck than just buy a couple different cards to "optimize' my deck.

RATING: 9
In Dominion, each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards. In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can "buy" as they can afford them. Through their selection of cards to buy, and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end.

Dominion is not a CCG, but the play of the game is similar to the construction and play of a CCG deck. The game comes with 500 cards. You select 10 of the 25 Kingdom card types to include in any given play—leading to immense variety.

Fast playing game. A kind of reverse Magic the Gathering. You lay out 10 kingdom cards, each gives you a bonus (extra action, buy, coin, card, or something). You draw 5 cards and play them; you have one action, one buy (unless your played action card(s) says differently). Build the perfect deck (buying action cards, victory point and more money) and the winner is the one with the most victory points at the end. I love the game because it is fast paced and because, with the expansions, no two games are alike. Try it!

RATING: 8
Essentially a masterpiece. Introduce the relativelly new concept of "Create your own deck. Then play with it", only present in CCG until Dominion release. The variety of kingdom cards provided in the base set is large enough to enable lots of different strategies, which guarantee that the game will last "fresh" during an indecent amount of plays. 

Moreover, altough the average game length (20-30 minuts) could imply that we are talking about a light game, this is definitelly not the case. Being able to both choose a correct deck building strategy and adapting that to other players manouvers is not generally a piece of cake. 


The main drawback of this game is that some strategies (essentially those involving drawing tons of cards each turn) can end up dramatically arising the general downtime, which kill one of the strenghs of Dominion: its fastness. However, these kind of situations are not common due to the fact that the random kingdom cards setup and the ending conditions usually prevent this kind of "eternal turns" from happening too often.


All in all, Dominion is a meaty game (with more meat that other games with playtimes 5 times higher) with a very small playtime, suitable for almost everyone. Completelly recomendable.

Very interesting mechanic, but I don't like the victory conditions. I have to agree with the comment somebody else said on the internet:" It's a mechanic in search of a game". I would have prefered more something like attack your opponent, or capture some resource on the table. I think what is missing is something that stays on the table.

It's also hard to know what is your current balance of your deck in order to determine what are it's weakness to patch. Most people argues that the box was really not convenient to store the cards, either thay would have put more space to plan for expansion or either there should have use a linear storage box with separators.

Finally, I don't like the idea of having gold card which in fact works like land in magic. It's like a regression in the CCG concepts. Now most CCG trys to avoid the land bug by making sure all cards have multiple usages (use as land or ability). I would have loved dominion to have multiple use to each cards. Maybe each action can either be played as an action or as gold. Anyways, it's just and idea.

RATING: 6
An interesting deck-building or deck-accumulation game, where you are trying to acquire card(s) with each hand, to build a growing personal deck.  The number of cards for each one you attain increases the probabilities of drawing them with each hand when you cycle thru your whole deck.  Getting too many weak cards or minor cards could dilute your strong cards that you covet with each hand.  It can be addictive when you find certain cards sets integrated for certain games.

RATING: 10
Early rating, this one has the potential to get to a 10.  Rating bumped from an 8 to a 9 as I have gotten more plays.  So far, I only played 2 players but it is a game my wife and I are both enjoying.  Quick playing with good variety due to the different cards, I expect to get 100+ plays before I tire of this one.  Currently my wife and I are both winning about 50% of the time.

Edit:  I have bumped to a 10.  I have also played 4 player now. I enjoy the concept of building an efficient deck and the variety of cards keeps the game fresh. I don't see myself tiring of this game and the expansion will only add more variety.

RATING: 6
LIKE:

* Variability of each game due to 10 different cards being played each game.  
* Interesting concept of making a game out of deck-building.
* Expansion possibilities (which is obviously reality!)
* Tension of building a deck versus purchasing VP cards which clog your deck but give you points.
* Generally plays very quickly and often can be played a couple times in a row.

DISLIKE:

* If it drags, this game gets extremely painful to play.  This is too light a game to take time to think about what you need to do.
* More interaction would be interesting.  Some of the expansions address this but may go too far.

Kb. tucatnyi játék után jött csak el az a játék, amikor ráéreztem a Dominion ízére. Akkor sikerült olyan akciókombinációkat összeválogatnom a pakliépítésnél, hogy működött a paklim, nagyon jó érzés volt, kifejezetten jól esett az a játék. Ennek hatására elkezdtem sokkal nyitottabbá válni a különböző lapok iránt, nem csak mindig ugyanazt a néhány jónak tartottat felhúzni, és most úgy érzem, hogy mindenféle akciókártya iszonyú értékes és hasznos, szóval most a játék minden apró részletében a lehetőséget látom, és ettől sokkal jobban élvezem, mint valaha.
De egy dolog még mindig van benne, ami zavar: túl sokszor kell lapot húzni és paklit keverni. Két játékos esetén épp csak végzek az öt lap felhúzásával (meg esetleg a paklikeveréssel) mire ismét rám kerül a sor, azaz így nem marad időm átélni a másik játékos játékát, cselekedeteit, pedig szeretném, számomra azzal együtt lenne teljes a játék.
Mindenesetre, valószínű, hogy ehhez előbb-utóbb kiegészítő(ke)t is fogok vásárolni (de csak miután magyarul megjelennek).

I can see why this is considered a classic by most, and why it founded a whole new genre of board games. Its a well crafted design, that spawned a million impersonators. It is also terribly boring. I kind of skipped Dominion when it first came out and went straight to Thunderstone because TS had a theme that made sense to the game. When I did finally get around to playing Dominion I was shocked I didn't despise it, because lets be honest we are all pretty burnt out on Deck Building Games. But there was also nothing all that interesting about it either. Maybe it just that the DBG genre has been so overdone in the past 5 years that nothing is all that palatable anymore, other than Star Realms. Playing Dominion now for the first time is like going back and listening to a music tape. You understand why, at the time, it was considered the creme of the crop, but now you just look back and realize how far we have come from that point in time.

I love it. Playing with the basegame only often leads to similar games even though cards are chosen random, because some cards are just too important while others are too weak.
This hardly happens when adding expansions. The variety with all expansions is gigantic, no two games are the same.
Still the game is just a rush for the 8 point cards most of the time. Sometimes I would like longer games.

Very interesting card game in which one builds a deck while the game is in progress.  I love the challenge of trying to build the most efficient engine to power purchases.  Further play with different card combinations has shown that this game has legs.  Five player with 12 kingdom cards played until 4 piles run out works fairly well.

Don't own this, but I've enjoyed the times I've played it. I love developing my card engine. It fails a little bit in that once I get my deck how I like it, the game is over.

I call this game "Soggy Biscuit".  The gamer's equivelent to competitive Onanism.  Like M:tG without the tactical play, long-term planning, and strong playing interaction, leaving only the most autistic parts:  deck-building and "super combos".  Card play is idiotically simple and shallow. 

The absurdity of this game was only worsened when it was pointed out to me that simply buying up silver and gold and bypassing all the action cards was not only a valid strategy, but likely the optimal one.

So far this game is a massive winner. Easy to learn, quick to play and immense replay ability with the multiple combination of kingdom cards.

I like the tension created by other players getting richer and richer, and getting more and more victory points.  Race for the Galaxy somewhat lacks this.

Memorizing the contents of each deck (including one's own) is nicely challenging.

The variety offered by the multiplicity of setups is nice.  The setup time is relatively long, though (compared to Race for the Galaxy, for instance), as you have to select the decks to be used, to remove some Victory cards (especially in 2-player games), to order the cards by cost (if wanted),...

Downtime is minimal... except when one has to wait until a deck is shuffled.  Shuffling the deck is bothersome, but also challenging, as it can divert from the game (I find it relatively hard to remain concentrated, when shuffling)!

Decisions are not as tough and varied as in Race for the Galaxy: most hands play themselves, except when it comes to choosing what to buy.  I generally buy the most expensive card I can, which limits even more the range of choices.

Decisions also do not have an immediate or obvious impact, as newly purchased cards go to the discard pile, and will appear back randomly.  This is in contrast with Race for the Galaxy, where advancing one's tableau has a strong impact, or where discarding cards means that many possibilities probably won't surface back any soon.

Understanding why the winner won is quite challenging for me, even when all players show their decks at the end of the game.

I appreciate the short playing time.  The setup is a little bit long (it's a little bit hard to find the right set of cards in the box), especially compared to Race for the Galaxy.

The gameplay experience is refreshing (i.e. original), and I'm quite addicted to it: none of my games has ever got so many plays in such a short period of time!

The deck building aspect is rooted in card frequencies (since you can get up to 10 cards of the same type, in a deck of typically 40 cards).  Card interactions also play a role.  However, the variety of the cards found in a game of Magic: the Gathering cannot be found here.

Downgraded to 9 because I find that Puzzle Strike has a few advantages over Dominion.

Dominion is fantastic, however I made a mistake of buying too many expansions too quickly. Now I find the game overwhelming to play because we have so many cards to pick from and set up.

But that isn't the game's fault. We largely stick to the base cards because those are the ones we know well and can play quickly.

I'm just not motivated to learn the expansions. The base box has enough content for me.

I left my original entry from March because I hate hyperbole and I was just getting into gaming. Dominion was my third or fourth game since discovering that board games were not Monopoly and Scattergories. Seriously. I rated the game a 10, and I was sincere, I loved it, six months later I have yet to actually PLAY another hand of a 10 rated game. This is sad, and what makes me even more sad is that the video reviews on Youtube (dicetower for one)mention that they OWN every single expansion ... they haven't PLAYED them, but they OWN them. So? For me a game is not a work of art, a game is meant to be played, sometimes frequently, sometimes not. The picture above my computer was not meant to be interactive, but Dominion is. I just can't justify holding on to a base game that nearly REQUIRES expansions just because I enjoy it. I have since changed my opinions and since my girlfriend has become picky about what games that she'll play with me. I hate to drop Dominion so far down - I mean a SEVEN?! But I just don't want to play it, even when it's free online. I'm sorry Dominion, you will always have a place in my heart....

and the review that made me post that one ...

I love this game. Honestly I hate cards but this game is amazing. What really makes this game great is the amount of possibility. Really I would like some expansions, but for now Dominion gets a ten. Well rounded, small amount of luck, fun, non-combative, this game deserves every award that it has won. Grade: A+

Very nice game mechanics. I like that its a solid 2 player game but can support i think comfortably 4.

The game is fun to play and addictive.

Only 7 because player interaction is lacking. No social aspect at all...even expansions that "add" player interaction is really just asking the other player for x, y,z card.

I like board games cause its a social activity, and all my dominion games have been silent games where people are focused very heavily on what they want to buy.

EDIT: Have to lower the score on this further. I don't think this is a 7 level. Dominion is a game I respect, but one that I never can muster enthusiasm for. I just don't feel that extra "gosh I want to play dominion really badly" draw.

We are probably in the vast minority, but unfortunately the game fell flat for us.  As has been expressed very well in a few reviews, the bulk of the game is not about [i]card play[/i] per se, but what cards you buy and deck building.  Since the card play and card combos in your hand are usually obvious, they don't give a feeling of satisfaction of accomplishment like in other games we like such as  [GAMEID=8217] or [GAMEID=12002].  One of the problems is that the cards themselves just aren't very [i]interesting[/i] (and the introductory set up is probably the worst offender in that regard)---for example, many of them are just variations of the few basic effects such as +action, +coin, or +card.  As a result, even though there are 25 kingdom cards included, many of them just don't feel very different from each other.  The actual differences are subtle and require a lot of experience to fully take advantage of.  This may be interesting from a statistical and optimization standpoint, but it just wasn't very fun and felt very dry and mechanical to us.  I also think that philosophically, the game didn't match up well with us---this game is all about flux and managing your ever changing deck.  We tend to enjoy games where you build something that has some permanence.  

One review compared this to [GAMEID=9217], particularly in the dry number-crunching sense of turning money straight into VPs.  Tellingly, we didn't really enjoy that game either.  [GAMEID=36218] is much better in that regard, and the deck building concept on the fly is novel and exciting, but it just left us wanting more.

RATING: 7.5
This is a great game with lots of tactical options. Due to the way you only get a small part of the available cards in a game it has a high replay-ability but ... something was missing .. and that's interaction between the players.
We felt like both playing a game on our own that coincidentally was played on the same board (or table that is). I hope that an expansion will fix this problem because otherwise this game might not get out of the closet to much I fear.

This is kind of my favorite game because I love to play it any chance I get.  That doesn't mean I think it's the best game ever.  It's just right up my alley.  I love deckbuilders, and I love planning my whole strategy before the game even starts.  Now, other people hate that aspect of it.  And I totally understand.  That's why I don't force this game on people at all.  It's really a game for a target audience and not for other people.

Everyone complains that the theme is pasted-on.  Yes, the rulebook and the box's flavor text is goofy.  But so what.  It's just flavor text, and we shouldn't take ourselves too seriously.  Some of the later expansion's flavor texts were actually hilarious.  This one not so much.

Is the theme pasted on?  Yes and no.  I think the theme across all the expansions is consistent with itself.  You're in midevil ages up through colonial ages.  And all of the cards really explore a lot of aspects of all those times.  So I think the game did a good job of exploring its theme.

But could it have been any other theme?  Yes absolutely.  But that doesn't make it a bad game at all.

I have a feeling the game seems to play the same a lot and there seems cards that a more powerfull than other and thus leading for same strategies over and over again, Only time will tell...

It's unfortunate I'm not recording plays on this, because it would likely have the most of any games we own.  Highly flexible in terms of number of players, and reasonably permutable given the number of cards now available.  My only complaint would be that for certain randomly-dealt cardsets, the best path to winning can be pretty obvious, so it's just a race of sorts. Still, easy to learn, fun for the whole family, etc.

Great game and very addictive. The fact that my wife loves it and seems to be quite good at it is excellent. Slight nag is that the "pretty" action cards are sometimes more of a hinderance than a help, and that in most cases treasure mainly is stronger.  The fun though is trying to figure out the best card mixes for a given set-up.

RATING: 8
A surprisingly engaging and addictive game, that sneaks up on you during your first couple of plays. Your first few turns will feel a bit tedious until you start playing the extra Actions you've bought; then the game starts getting interesting. Several different ways to play; the key is balance. Too many of any one type of card and you'll find yourself unable to progress steadily.

RATING: 6
Definitely not my kind of game but I do see the appeal in it. It can be quick, fast and over in 20 minutes. However with new players, it's going to be a huge snoozefest especially when they manage to hit a combo (hmm I wonder if I should play this action or that) again and again and all you can do is sit there and try not to get angry at not being able to do anything. On the first play, I thought it was totally multiplayer solitaire. It was only later did I realise that I was basing my moves on the other player's. Depending on what the other player bought, I would try to figure out a better combo or counter to their strategy or something. I've only played 2 games so far, so I think I might actually give like this if the expansions makes this game really worthwhile. But with just the base set, it is really boring and full of shuffling and automatic decisions.

We're currently in the throes of a Dominion addiction. We have both Intrigue and Seaside expansions, and everyone we've introduced to has gone out and bought the game afterward - except for a few who are tight on funds at the moment, so they instead call us to make game dates every weekend. Can't complain about that! I love the replayability and hand management. This is my first experience with a deck building game mechanic and I love it. This is the only game we own that at an hour past our bedtimes, we can have played four times already, and still want to play "just one more game".

To start with the obvious, I like Dominion a great deal less than the overwhelming majority of the gaming public. I do like the second base set, Dominion: Intrigue, significantly more, although I won't say that I love it either. I haven't played Seaside, Alchemy, Prosperity or any other expansion or base set enough yet to have a firm opinion.

With that out of the way, on with the vivisection…

Actually, I'll begin by stating that there is some genuine genius to be found here. Building a deck in play is a marvelous idea that probably prompts a "why didn't *I* think of that!" response from a large percentage of gamers. Hopefully it will be explored in future game designs that are more amenable to my interests.

The VP cards are a cute idea, too, although one that I think is fatally flawed in the final analysis (in the absence of letting the cards do something else). While it makes the transition from income and infrastructure to scoring more difficult, having your deck spammed is less fun, and it makes the one point VP cards almost as distasteful as the -1 VP Curse cards.

Ingenuity aside, however, Dominion is gaming junk food – highly addictive in the moment, but an empty experience that leaves me dissatisfied, even a little hung over, almost immediately after I stop. In particular, I find the lack of continuity between hands really dissatisfying. There is no building of infrastructure and the deckbuilding element, which should offer some feeling of continuity, is undercut by the absence of hand management imposed by having to discard the remnants of your hand (and drawing a fresh hand) at the end of each of your turns. There is almost nothing tying one hand together to the next, and I find this makes for a hollow gaming experience. Even something as light as Lost Cities offers more in this area.

This is augmented by how the structure of the game places the only meaty decision right at the start of play. Once the array of cards is selected for the game, there is a bit of time spent analyzing what cards and combinations are available, and then picking out what you think the best available strategy is. After that, most decisions are dictated by what cards you draw, and are trivial. Some thought has to be given to when to switch form building your deck over to focusing on buying VPs, but this is mostly a matter of when you can buy Provinces with reasonable consistency.

I also find the fact that just buying money, ignoring the action cards, is a strong (and sometimes even the strongest) strategy a bit weird. While experienced players won't choose this path a lot, and the Thief decimates it, playing it is not a stupid move, but more or less destroys the middlegame for the person playing it. It also ignores the most interesting element of the game: the cool powers the cards offer.

People who (wrongly) argue that Race for the Galaxy and Princes of Florence are multiplayer solitaire really need to get a load of Dominion.

Oh, that's right. They probably love it because of all the take that cards. Unfortunately, I find take that games (Citadels or Inn-Fighting, for instance) anywhere from boring to distasteful, and Dominion is no exception. Fortunately it is possible to leave those cards out, but at that point the only effect players have on each other is depleting the card tableau, which times the end of the game.

Finally, there are games when one or more of the players get major combo engines rolling – endless streams of Villages and Festivals granting a dozen actions and a batch of purchases. In these games, one of the few real assets on Dominion's side, its pace of play, is inverted and the experience can be excruciating. These combo engines are shiny, and tend to draw in new players more than experienced players.

So, yeah. Dominion. Not my thing, really.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I eventually realized why all the card powers are so simple in Dominion. It's because your "tableau" is whatever cards you happen to hold and draw over the course of a turn. Since there's no guarantee you can connect card X to card Y, a card's combo-power has to be extremely basic or it would never be useful. So the result is that [b]the very thing which makes the game novel[/b] (i.e. the deckbuilding) is what drags it down.

RATING: 8
Despite the lack of theme and that I feel there are too many turns spent buying silver (yes I know how much silver you should buy changes with the cards available, but there are too many turns spent buying silver in general), even a single card stack change can dramatically affect the gameplay, causing you to have to constantly adopt your strategy and adding a huge amount of variety. I disagree with people who consider this game being basically a solitaire experience, as you have to keep track of how fast the stacks are running out and what other people are buying in order to perform successfully, notwithstanding some (albeit small) interaction with attack cards.

EDIT: I've now played many other deckbuilders: Legendary both Marvel and Encounters, Shadowrift, Ascension, Thunderstone, Paperback, Star Realms, Magecraft, Friday, Hyperborea, Mage Knight, Trains, Xenoshyft, Automobiles, Flip City, Valley of the Kings. While the lack of theme and low level of interaction of Dominion means I think many other deck builders have a niche, I still think Dominion is the best deck builder out there. 

Firstly, this is because I think most of the other deck builders do not have as balanced cards as Dominion. There are only a couple of cards in Dominion that are very swingy (e.g Thief), and it is possible to mitigate against those cards by building your deck accordingly. Also, while there are definitely cards that are more useful in more situations, besides maybe Adventurer almost every card can be an all-star in the right situation. Meanwhile, in Thunderstone how your level 3 heroes clump together can make or break the game for you, in Xenoshyft the order of the monsters that you have very little control over can really screw you over, etc.. Also, there are cards in Trains, Thunderstone, that you never buy. There are also not of many cards that get out of hand (well quite a few in the last few expansions, but they can be diluted to weaken their combos), whilst in Legendary there are cards that at times are just terrible and other times 

Secondly, most games do not have as nuanced cards as Dominion (e.g. Library: draw back up to 7 to counter Militia: discard down to 3). Changing even one of the card stacks can totally change up your play style, whereas for most other games I feel like there are a few obviously strong cards and you try to build around those each game. I think Dominion is also helped by the one buy, one action aspect per turn. While some people may feel this is restrictive, it makes it harder to spam cards, and I feel like requires more careful deck building. While Smithy is just +3 cards, the lack of actions afterwards and need of buys to take advantage of the potentially large money hand you are about to get means you have to purchase other cards too. Meanwhile, Control Room in Trains (also +3 cards) feels like a really bland card because it just lets you do more of what you already can do.

Thirdly, for some other deck builders, the deck building aspect is kind of just pushed to the side and used as a tool, making the engine building feel much weaker (Paperback, Mage Knight, and while I haven't played it, I suspect Baseball Highlights 2045).

Fourthly, Dominion's VP mechanism makes it harder for runaway leader, or if there is one the game is almost over anyways. In contrast, the rewards for defeating enemies and not putting the monsters in your deck in Legendary means it actually promotes runaway leader, and Star Realms is so reliant on card combos that things can snowball like crazy.

Finally, Dominion is simple enough for new gamers, yet with it's different puzzle every game can keep experienced gamers engaged.

As for the base game, while some may think it is bland (and I certainly agree with the beginner setup unless you are playing with nongamers), I really like how the cards are so simple yet have all these subtle combos with each other. It creates a sort of elegance within the game.

feel like a solitary game..

played some more games, wouldn''t say i''m addicted to it but always think about it :>
its fun to use different combos, but it gets a bit confusing and boring towards the end (+ 2 action, +2 cards x 8 times...... my opponent literally started her next turn while waiting for me)... also don''t know when to stop the game to win...

Comments entered on 23 Dec 2009:

Dominion was released in October 2008. This was a game that appeared on some of the hot lists for Boardgamegeek rather suddenly. I may have missed some of the initial buzz but the time from when I first heard about the game to the time when I played my first game was less than a month. This is rare as most games get months of buzz before release.

I have been able to play this on many occasions already, and it is very rare to only play one game when it does get played. I have taught probably 8-10 people how to play, and a couple of them even purchased their own copies of the game after playing. However, I taught my friend, John, who was a die-hard Magic player how to play, and he actually did not enjoy the game very much.

I get the hype, now. My wife can shop, and I can hunt, perfect. Also known as 'The Shuffling Game'. I'm happy to have this game especially considering that Dale Yu is one of my favorite people on BGG.

The game for me will always lose a point because of the card backs not being a particular side up. This makes all of the shuffling that much more difficult, especially with the cards in sleeves.

I have gotten complaints regarding the card text's masculine-only gender usage. Magic The Gathering has gotten this right since 1993, I don't see why Dominion couldn't do as well in 2009. For each time I hear complaints about the strict usage of "He" and "His" on the card text... the game will never rate higher than an '8' with me.

I was relatively new to modern boardgames when I learned Dominion but my teacher was not.  And he was quite a stickler for the rules nearly restarting the game when I placed a card in the wrong pile.

This game offers a lot of what I want in a game.  It's quick while requiring some interesting decisions.  It also provides that occasional "Ah-Ha" moment when you discover a clever combination.  All of that with a simple ruleset.

Granted, I've only played three times, so my rating might go down if it lacks staying power, but right now, I'm impressed.

UPDATE:  I've lowered my rating on this, more from deck-building fatigue than anything else.  Frankly, I'm not too thrilled that the boardgame industry has moved in the direction of pumping out as many deck-building games as possible.  I'm concerned that this move is caused, in part, by a lack of ingenuity in the industry, which may not bode well for its future.  Just ten to fifteen years ago, the boardgame hobby seemed to offer a much more diverse universe of games and gaming experiences.

Dominion is not to blame for this, but I do think that the ubiquity of its deck-building mechanic is a symptom of other problems in the boardgame industry, namely euro-fatigue and the lack of design focus it brings, amateurism in design and publishing, and the economics of the industry which has curtailed the very important role of game development and other processes integral to the publication of high-quality games (proofing comes to mind).

A lot of people say that this isn't a CCG replacement, and I won't say that it is.  However, it does scratch that itch the same way that Jambo and Blue Moon did, probably a little better.  Deck drafting as in-game strategy is ingenious, and the fact that it takes less than five minutes to set up and less than five minutes to teach (even to non-gamers) but still has depth and replayability abound is what sells this game.

I was very excited to get and play this game.  The idea of a game with deck building being a central mechanic was intriguing.  The theme was definitely one I could get behind. 

After a few plays, Dominion has been a colossal disappointment.  I really, really wanted to love it, and I tried, but in the end, it's just not that compelling of a game.   Boring, dry, repetitive.  Virtually no interaction at all.  

I found myself calling out my plays to my opponent  (okay, playing a Village, drawing one, playing a Smithy, one action left, etc.) and realized that the only reason I was doing it was to keep us both involved in what was going on.  Otherwise, we were oblivious to what the other was doing. 

There are many games that I don't care for that are highly regarded by the BGG community, but usually I can at least appreciate why they are so esteemed.  I'm drawing a blank on this one, though.  I can not, for the life of me, understand why this is ranked #6.

Innovative and slick game of deck building to score points.  With many cards and only 10 in each game, there is an immense replay value, though some cards do tend to dominate, leaving others by the way-side.  Set-up is a bit of a pain, but it lends itself well to multiple games at a sitting, thus easing that issue.  It does have some depth to it too, the way you see the game progress changes as your experience with it increases.  Reading the environment is key - some games will be a race to get to 8 gold and others will be more about setting yourself up for the long game.  A good game because it is satisfying without being too long.  But despite the immense replay value of so many different cards (and more and more with expansions) I don't see this as a great game, that certain cards will come to dominate a set-up.  I am happy with owning it and will play it regularly, but don't feel any great need to pursue the expansions.
UPDATE (somewhat belated): I held with that view until Prosperity and I got to try it out. Altered the dynamics so much I added it to my collection and then Seaside too. But really done with it now. Looking at the new previews, the cards are getting more and more convoluted and that is not what I want from this game.

I admit, I didn't get it at first. That's it? I'd ask myself.  But gradually, it's grown on me, especially with the addition of the expansions, and Seaside in particular.  Now it feels like a very rich sort of puzzle, and the replayability is just incredible... there's a simple sort of genius at work.  Though I still don't really grasp the point of Chancellor.  Never bought it, and probably never will. --12.29.10

This game is more than just easy to get into and lots of fun - it also feels sort of like the "logical next step" after CCGs. If you're at all familiar with Magic, etc., playing Dominion will feel to you something like the way that Settlers or Tactics must have felt to a generation of Americans bored with endless, tedious rounds of Clue and Monopoly. 

Ultimately, it doesn't quite hit my sweet spot, because although the card art is uniformly impressive, the game is pretty themeless. After a few plays the cards really might as well just have numbers and abstract symbols on them. But that doesn't detract too much from the sheer innovative genius of the design.

I think Dominion plays best on a computer. The phyiscal version is fun but takes too long to set up given the length of the game and certain card combos can get confusing. King's Courting cards can result in you cycling through your deck leading to a huge amount of book keeping. In a digital format this is done automatically and keeps play quick. The physical version, however, grinds to a halt as each player has to calculate how many actions, buys, money, price reductions etc they have at each stage of a long combo of card plays. I'd rate the computer version of Dominion an 8 or a 9 and the physical version more like a 7.

Brilliant game that completely re-energized the entire card game market today. Innovative and is the perfect solution to all the problems I have with collectible card games like Magic where your strength as a player is more decided by the amount of money you have poured into your decks than anything else. You still get to cleverly build your own deck based strategies, but everyone here starts off on an equal footing and has the same chance to win as everyone else.

Saying that this is THE worst deck building game ever, is an understatement. What really makes me hate this game is what happens when you buy victory point cards. In a game like Ascension, when you get victory points (honor points), they just go in your pool of points. But in Dominion, they go into your discard pile, which means on subsequent turns, you will surely draw useless victory point cards. This effectively dilutes your deck, which basically goes against the whole concept of deck building. I've lost count of how many games I lost because I went on for 2-3 turns without drawing anything but victory point cards. This got old and frustrating really fast.

If you want a DBG that's well designed and leaves you with a good, positive and long lasting experience, then play Ascension. Hell, even selling your organs to buy that extra CCG booster pack to play a game like Pokémon or MTG is a better alternative to Dominion.

I love Dominion if only for the ease of play and variety of cards. Even the base set of the game comes with enough replay value to keep things going for a long time. Yes, it's a little bland. Yes, the artwork doesn't always match up. But what you get for your money is a neat game that spawned a generation of new deck builders for us to enjoy.

This game changed how I look at board games. I played it with some friends and was hooked. It's a little intimidating, but dive in and play, you'll figure out the rules as you go along. the more you play the more you become familiar with thee cards, which makes using the cards to benefit much easier. The expansions aren't necessary, but fun to have if you plan on playing alot.

I think the cards are coated with an addictive substance, like cocaine.  Once you start, you can't stop.  The substance gets through the card sleeves too.

Edit: Looking back, the base game itself would get old after enough plays.  The expansions introduce the variety in the number of
"machines" -> $ -> land and attack cards to slow others down keeps the game as interesting as when I first played the base game.

86% of the folks polled (on a small poll) indicated that it is better to start with the basic dominion set (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/460334/which-dominion-should-i-buy). The basic game seems to be a better gateway game. The majority of folks who prefer Intrigue are those who have played the basic game to death (i.e., hundreds of plays).

Instant hit. Works great as a nonconfrontational couples game.

Also plays great with up to four. The extended family loves it, which is key for me.

I like that strategic play can typically win, but that in the right circumstances, luck can play a role.

Edit: The vast majority of my plays are two-player with the same opponent. We have played hundreds of times with a variety of expansions.  Games are often close, except when we use colonies (which tend to lead to more disparate scores).  Still great fun. And unless we use really action heavy card set-ups we can normally play a game in 20-30 minutes, which is a plus.

RATING: 7
8/2008 Finally someting NEW among the masses of released games.  It's all about building a deck of cards.  You start out with 10 cards - 7 coins and 3 VPs.  Then on each turn you draw 5 cards; play action card and purchase new cards: coins, actions or VPs.  Throughout the game one has to balance the deck content and toward the end focus on having the most VP cards in your deck.  
The basic game contains 500 card, but only 25 different action cards.  This will be the games downfall quickly becoming booring and repetitive.  My initial rating will probably drop fast with further play.

2/2010 My prediction has been all wrong so far.  With the continued output of new expansions the initial 25 kingdom cards is no longer a limitation.  I'm changing the base game rating down to 8 from 9, only to give the Intrigue expansion a 9er as it is rather more interesting with added options.

5/2010 Further play haven't shown further depth.  The game consept is too solitare, and the little interaction is mostly one-way and not inter-active nor subtle enough.  Intrigue is the better box at 8 while basic Dominion is a 7 at best.

Occasionly a frustrating or too-slow game results from a poor selection of cards. 

Other than that, a brilliant design, with huge variety from simple rules, and interesting strategy choices, which have to vary game-to-game.  Plus, it's short and light enough that you can afford to experiment with cards you haven't used before, and just have fun with it (which can't be said of the unloved buildings of PR for example).

Really very clever design indeed, with cards nicely balanced and everything flowing very smoothly.
Simple, clean, addictive fun.

Have invested in several expansions (avoiding the duffers Alchemy and Seaside) and it really does increase the variety and the options. It's more of the same, but the game is all about the available combos, and making good use of them, so this is one game where expansions work.

First impression: Felt very low on interaction. Deckbuilding element appeals to an old TCGer.

Update after several plays: There is interaction after all (witch, thief, militia, spy, bureaucrat) but none of it is directed. So you can't hit the leader. You can win this game while completely ignoring what the other players do. Furthermore if you draw your copper 3-4 in the first two rounds, you are at a significant disadvantage against other players that were able to buy a 5 cost card, that is very likely to come up soon, since their deck is small. Finally the theme doesn't feel very well integrated in the game, likely a paste-on.

more updates: A thing I overlooked, that leads me to correct my rating upwards, is that Dominion is a nice filler due to the short playing time and good replayability.

PROs:
-) Simple basic concept that yet leads to several possible strategies. 
-) Nice blending of deckbuilding in the gameplay.
-) Good variety (and potential for expansions).
-) Short (ideal to tinker with different setups).
-) Addictive.
-) Easily expanded.

CONs:
-) Some cards seem clearly more important (powerful) than others.
-) Luck of the draw is far from negligible. 
-) Tiebreaker is not enough of a compensation for the advantage of playing first.
-) Annoying costant (re)shuffling.
-) The important info on the cards could have been printed more clearly.
-) The artwork is unimpressive, when not downright bad.
-) It'll have multiple expansions.

The game that started it all. Deck building I mean. I still enjoy the game as I haven't played it too much. It's a quite fast game (setup takes a bit of time), but the theme is a bit thin. I like [b]Rune Age[/b] better.

Fabulous game.  Once players understand the basic concept games fly by with little down time between turns.  Lots of variability (I like games with variability a lot) and lots of replay ability.  If the game become stale there are a truck load of expansions.
Streamlined. Elegant. Not fussy or fiddly at all. Good clean well designed deck builder.

Dominion is a brilliant deck builder. The core set gives you everything you need to enjoy it. It is a good way to get a newcomer into the style of game as it is lovely presented, well illustrated and all explained well. Randomising  the cards for purchase adds a good amount of variation straight out of the box. A good amount of replayability. Possibly a must for any collection.

The ranking can go up or down after more plays. For now it looks like one of my favourites with nice strategy - tactics ballance, many possible set up positions, and quick play. I always think of other possibilities of constructing my deck and "one more time" feel is omnipresent after the game.

This fits the gap that quitting Magic left in my life as a gamer nicely (deck-building! combo-hunting!) while being much more accessible.
After nearly three months, I'm still playing this very often (on BSW) without getting bored, and with expansions on the horizon and I think it will keep its appeal for many many years!

RATING: 9
Brilliantly elegant mechanics give a simple deck building game rules wise with massive strategic variance due to the way difference cards combo. The base game is a little dull  and only gets a 9 for introducing the game. It's when you have 2 or three expansions that it really flowers. The Amazon Big Box is the best place to start, giving 3 expansions off the bat. Best as a 2 player game, but works ok as 3-4 player; start player has a bigger advantage there but as the game is so short it's not really an issue.

I kept seeing this in the Top 10 listing and the Hotness, and eventually took the plunge.  So glad I did, this is a brilliant game.  Strategies change with each different game, and even within a game if your opponent(s) starts messing with you.  Build your own deck as you go and try to get the most Victory points by the end of the game.

The idea for this game is great -- very appealing. The cards see a lot of handling, so I'd suggest sleeves right off the bat. Standard Euro sleeves work fine. Playing well requires an ability to analyze the interaction between the cards. The game continues to grow on me. We have played many of the expansions to this game, but we don't like the expansions that add new rules: Alchemy & Seaside in particular. We like Dominion for it's plain and simple rules, but we like a variety of cards as well. Both of our kids own this game. Favorite expansions in order: Hinterlands Prosperity, Intrigue. That's all you really need.

I acknowledge that it's a really good game, but I'm just not as into it as a lot of my friends. So I haven't bothered with the piles of expansions and all, which might be part of why I never got as into it? Hard to say. I'd definitely recommend it to most people, though, as it is a very good game.

I'm currently reconsidering my rating of this game. It had me spellbound for the first 10-15 plays, but once I realized that you actually only need 4-5 action cards to win the game, it kind of died out on me. All the interesting choices I felt I had, was all but a mirage.

This is a deck building game, and it's incredibly fun and easy to learn.  Setup takes a bit, but once you're past that play goes very quickly even for inexperienced players.

RATING: 10
Added to my collection in December 2008. First played in April 2009.

Very interesting game that seems to have a lot of depth. As a long time Magic player, many of the priciples of deck construction from that game hold true while playing Dominion. Highly recommended.

Ratings update December 2010. I initially rated this game as an 8 but as Dominion and the expansions are some of the most played games I own and everyone loves them, I have to upgrade the game from 8 to 10. It is unusual to rate a game a 10 but I feel that Dominion deserves it. Dominion has opened up new design space for board games and much like Magic, my other 10, it is an absolute classic.

In Dominion, each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards. In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can "buy" as they can afford them. Through their selection of cards to buy, and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end.

The base game of Dominion is great, but has a limited shelf life.  Add in just one expansion and it just explodes with possibilities.  

One of my favorite things about Dominion is you plot out what you plan to do in the game based on the cards available at the start.  Once the game starts, it is all about tactically managing your deck.  You have to keep in mind what you've purchased & how many of each so you can keep your deck balanced with the plan you set out to do at the start of the game.  

Once you start to add in an expansion (or more!), the game play starts to become quite deep.  Yet, the rules are simple.  Great combination!

I love combos!

Most of my friends and even my family love to play this game. The only drawback for me is the limited player interactions. While you have to watch your opponents moves it is not that critical and in some cases seems like a solitaire race for the provinces (not the case with every set of cards). But that could be also one of the plus points for this game, because it just flows. Its quick and easy has a TON of variety with thousands of strategies. Love it.

RATING: 4
Great for fast games online, not sure if I would like it in person, though.  It would probably drag.  There are some strong strategies, I think players of equal skill would be highly dependent on luck.

Four players really drags, two and three is preferred.

In real life, the book keeping of +action cards is a little annoying.

Okay, approaching 200 plays and the thrill is gone.  Figuring out the combos was my favorite part, now it mostly comes down to the skill of the players and the luck of the cards.  When the skill of the players is similar, the entire game boils down to who happens to draw the bets card combos turn-to-turn, which is just not fun for me.  I will probably play this a few more times, but I'm pretty much done now.

RATING: 5
Meh.  So, there's a lot of important decisions that go into optimizing a deck.  But the fact that it requires a lot of thought doesn't make it enjoyable.  It's like the Su Doku of games--you can almost mindlessly play it over and over and get really good at the strategies, with the different combos keeping it interesting for longer than the mechanic really deserves.  Top it all off with a heavy dose of randomness, and I don't see myself coming back to this.  (And on the subject of interaction, I don't think there is any.  Sure, some cards affect other plays, but in the manner of an annoying and arbitrary random event, not in a strategic manner.)  I don't see myself ever requesting this, and I'm on the verge of actively avoiding it.

Nice deck-building game, easy to learn/teach, plenty of replayability, many strategic choices.
Playing with 4 players may increase the downtime considerably, so I think 2-3 is the best.

Setting up, especially if you own a couple of expansions can be a pain in the ass... At least, there are some great apps for android/iOS to pick random starting kingdoms from whichever exp you want, instead of shuffling all the cards together everytime.

Absolutely brilliant game for card lovers like me. Every turn you can buy one (sometimes more) cards to go into your own private deck. There are three kinds of cards you can buy: victory points, money, and special actions. You try to build a deck that allows you to buy the victory cards faster. Fast, easy and fun, but strategy is subtle. Best with 2-4 players.

This is an amazing game.  Building a CCG-engine deck that you use throughout the game...it's just staggeringly brilliant.  

The use of only a set number of different Kingdom card types in any one game seems like it will keep the game fresh for quite awhile.  Currently, with D, D:I, D;S, D:A, D;P, D:C, D:H, D;DA, D:G, D:Adv and the (5) promo cards, there are 235 Kingdom cards to mix and match.

Wow.

-- Platinum & Colony come in if the first card drawn from the Randomizers is from Prosperity, or if at least 3 kingdom cards are from Prosperity
-- Shelters come in if the last card drawn from the Randomizers is from Dark Ages, or if at least 3 kingdom cards are from Dark Ages
-- We've finally figured out the number of cards we like best for 2p:  8 each for Victory Cards, 6 each for other Kingdom Cards, and 10 each for Curses.  Treasure supply piles stay unchanged.  This is a good balance for 2p.

This is one of our favorite games to play.  It has more depth to it than lost cities, but is still quick to play and you can get through a game in about thirty minutes.  The rulebook was confusing at first though, read through the entire thing before giving it a go - there was one section of the rules where it told you to put kingdom cards on the table, but didn't tell you how to choose which kingdom cards until later in the rulebook.

Excellent building game with only cards in an original concept. It has money cards, building(=action=kingdom) cards and victory point cards, yet there isn't even a seperate building area! The thing you are building is your deck of cards, which you recycle continuously to buy more buildings and victory points.

The deckbuilding aspect somewhat resembles the deckbuilding in Magic(CCG). There too you have to find a delicate balance: not too much mana, not too little, not too many low-cost spells, not too many. In Dominion the trade-off is between Victory cards, which only pollute your deck, and money/building cards, which improve your deck but don't make you win by themselves.

A game that's very fresh and innovative when first played, but after numerous plays, it comes down to a number crunching system. This loses the game's appeal quickly, and with a gaming group that's good in math, this becomes a quick run of maximizing your points.

RATING: 7.7
This was our introduction to deck-building (one of our favorite mechanisms), and it's an excellent game. We decided to trade it because we've moved on to deck-builders that we like much better, and we were just never going to choose to play Dominion over those other games.

We had two problems with Dominion. My husband didn't like that all the cards were laid out right from the beginning. He likes the more limited options of the Ascension-style purchase row. 

I didn't love how dry the game was. In my opinion, a game can be "themeless" and still not be "dry" if the mechanisms are interesting enough. In Dominion, the cards didn't feel unique to me. It was all about making sure that you got to play as many cards on a turn as possible, while at the same time making sure you got as many extra buys as possible.

Outstanding blend of CCG offline deckbuilding with Euro game sensibilities about elegance and strategy during the game itself. I suspect your reaction to this one may have something to do with your CCG experience, but perhaps not. I was a Magic:the Gathering player, always loved the game, but didn't love the all-consuming nature of CCGs. You can "dabble" with Dominion (and buy the entire standalone game for one fair price), unlike the CCGs I remember.

The first, and in my opinion, best deck-builder game I have played. All players start on an equal footing, and good decisions with the right combinations can ensure strategic success. Clever design and an elegant mechanic make this a firm favourite. Just be weary of the players who like to load up with multiple cards that have extra actions and extra card draws. You will watch them cycle through their whole deck before it's your turn! Being able to do this is great, but just remember you need that Gold too!

11/30/08: Tentative rating of 8 after one play.  I would say that this is Fluxx on steroids, but I don't want people to get the wrong idea.  This is an excellent game, whereas Fluxx is almost as far from excellence as one can get before coming back from the other side.  Planning the buys, balancing VP cards with useful cards so you don't get hands of crap often, it's all very cool.  I look forward to more plays.

Why is this game number 6 on BGG?  It's a card game! Anyway, a very over rated game it would seem.  I like the general idea, and in particular the fact that, unlike CCG's such as Magic: The Gathering there is no need to buy thousands of cards to play.  However, it actually suffers all the same problems that affect MtG: any experienced player will immediately spot that from all the kingdoms played there are only a few that are any use in a given game, and it's often the same cards that are powerful in any given game.  Thus gameplay is distilled into a grab for the right cards, in the smallest decks, so players can drill through the cards and grab victory cards.  After a few games you realise there aren't enough kingdoms in the base game to keep things fresh for long and guess what, you need to be expansions to freshen things up.  It *is* in fact a collectable card game after all.  Spent far too much money on MtG to be suckered into another CCG.  Perhaps, for somebody who has never played MtG there is fun to be had, but my group of players got little from this game.

Dominion is 75% of what I love about CCGs (deck building, taking advantage of good luck while overcoming bad luck, competition) without the 99% of what I hate about them (collectability) -- it rocks on toast with a cherry on top, and I would like more, please.

From starting on a level playing field to the pacing and overall feel of the game, Dominion is just a blast. It's easier for CCG players to grok, but also accessible to folks who've never played a CCG before. And like Pandemic, finishing a game makes me want to play again immediately.

Despite the fact that multiple plays have proven that my CCG brain doesn't mesh well with the skillset Dominion needs -- the ability to instantly assess the relative value of a set of 10 random cards and how they interact with one another (whereas I did my best at CCGs when I had a chance to hone a deck over a long period) -- I love losing at this game. When a game is fun to lose at repeatedly, it's a keeper.

I agonized over whether or not this needed to be sleeved, and decided (after much reading here) that it did. After seeing how much shuffling is involved in just one game, sleeving is a must.

---

Man, I used to love Dominion. Three things knocked it off my interest list and out of my collection.

First, I went big with it, and it collapsed under its own weight: I bundled multiple sets and expansions in a box with custom, labeled dividers, and sleeved every card. It became a production to play.

Second, my group's meta -- they were most interested in games without curses (and similar mechanics), and with an even spread of card costs, which made the game a) not essentially Dominion, and b) kind of same-y every time.

Third, it got fiddly -- especially when I contrast it with Ascension. Playing involved setup with a randomizer app, and then a discussion (see meta above), and then a fussy teardown after the game.

I'm sad to see it go, though, and I wish I'd stuck to just the base set, Seaside, and Intrigue from the outset. Re-rated from an 8 to a 7 (a long ways from its one-time height of 10!) and sold. I'd happily play it using someone else's copy, and without restrictions on the card selection.

---

After a few plays of just the core set, no expansions or fancy storage, re-rating from a 7 to an 8. I can see buying this again and not expanding it. The core gameplay is just so good.

Appeals to the gamer that just loves building stuff. It's a game that just feels good; planning that perfect combination of cards and then seeing it all come together, getting ever closer to that perfect combo you strive for, "but oh, you can do better!" you think, "how about just one more of these! And these!", before suddenly your opponent is satisfied and takes off and forces you to either follow him or take the chance and build further upon your deck! The game is low on interactivity between the players, but that's because this is more like a game of building, say, a rocket that's JUST good enough to get you to the moon before the other guys do. You could build the greatest rocket ever build, but if your opponents land on the moon before you, it's all been for nothing. Get the analogy? No? Oh well, just buy it anyway!

Played a partial game while I was sick...then I got too spaced out to finish.  It seemed like it had some good potential once you get to know the cards and what they do.  I see us quickly progressing to using a random assortment of cards.  Some reviews have also mentioned play stagnating once you start implementing a basic card accumulation strategy.  It may also get frustrating for Lawrence because there's an element of luck in the card shuffling/drawing.

The first two strategy games I played were Carcassonne and Dominion, and out of the two, Dominion was far and way the more compelling game. That said, the excitement wore off quite fast. I will play this game if someone requests it, but I don't think I will request it myself, not with all the better games available. In fact, after multiple plays of each, I think I prefer Carcassonne (with the expansions of course).

Update 3/3/14:

I still really like this game. I added two new promo cards to try and rejuvenate it a bit. I think it helped some, but I still get burnt out on this one fast. What really bothers me is the last couple of turns, when the game is on the line, there is just too much randomness. You might draw 11 money, or you might come up empty. When you lose, it leaves you feeling cold. When you win, it leaves you feeling very fortunate.

RATING: 7
the grand daddy deckbuilding game. The theme is kinda weak, but the combos you can pull off during this game make it really fun and entertaining. i like this best with three players, as you have some down time for shuffling in between rounds, since this is a very shuffle heavy game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A must-have game for anyone who's into CCGs.  The game itself is a stroke of brilliance (and has spawned myriad derivatives). The only drawback to Dominion is usually the other players.

EDIT: 12/10/2012 - You know, I actually like Dominion the more that I play it.  I'm typically opposed to card games, but I am starting to enjoy the game more and more.  Also, the two-player game takes much longer than one would expect.

Edit 04/19/14: Dominion is overrated, and it is only the expansions which redeem this. The base game is a solid 'meh' for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
2 / 5 - Fair.

Final verdict time. This is yet another low-interaction optimization/efficiency game. It's novel, short and manages to squeeze an awful lot of game play out of some very simple rules which makes it either ideal filler for efficiency gamers, or an efficiency game for the rest of us. But it's still the same old maximise-the-efficiency-engine sort of game that's become so tediously familiar over the last few years. It'd probably be worth another point of rating played with 4 - there is a *bit* more interaction and the extra downtime gives you space in which to shuffle properly! Theme is wafer thin. After ten plays or so, I just feel ... meh. See my review for more details: http://fortressat.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=821&Itemid=318

RATING: 9
A game very easy to learn but rather hard to get good at. There's tons of strategies you can play and I find myself changing strategy all the time, which makes me lose.

Millions of different combinations if you put an expansion in there, so there's not a chance in hell you'll get the same game twice ever if you play with random cards.

Even when drunk this game is fun. Played it a few times before going out and everyone's had a blast.

A great deck-building game. Dominion plays fast and it's fun! What's great is being able to mix and match cards from different expansions. The game still feels fresh as long as you fully randomize the cards. Only downside: So much shuffling! Solution: You can play online at goko.com! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.01
I'm terrible at this game.

Despite its four pages of rules and weight rating it is far deeper than a number of games with 40+ pages of rules and vastly higher weights.

This will eventually fall into the category of something that I tip my hat at the design aspect, but the abstract nature of the game and the endlessly shifting strategies for it makes me wonder if it will ever be actually fun. I feel like I'm grasping at straws playing, ie "so wait, how many Woodcutters am I suppose to grab?"

Deck building doesn't really cure the issue of a bad draw. It merely evens out the starting point and levels the playing field in terms of what players can add to their deck. Neither does being required to discard your whole hand in order to draw up to your max hand size every turn. Maybe I actually wanted to keep a card that I wasn't able to play and now I have to wait for it to come back up again and hopefully at the right time.

Ratings potential: 7. This seems fairly set for now.

Update after 13 plays: And it is dead. Murdered not by one game, but a host of others. This is one granddaddy of a genre that didn't hold up as others came out after it. I respect the hell out of the design, but this is merely an exercise in a mechanic. A great mechanic, but other games can offer that and add to it. Might be salvageable with certain expansion combos, but that it's it.

Received for Christmas 2008
Played twice with 2-players and I must say...I like it. Dominion was not a game on my wishlist but my wife got me a copy for Christmas thinking I'd like it.  I'm not one to normally like card-based games with lots of text but this game is really manageable.  After only two plays (with the recommended 'starting play' action cards) I'm ready to start branching out.  Pretty neat game and looking forward to playing with more people.

I was excited when i got it... 

i'm less excited now.

It's clever, but so thoroughly multiplayer-solitaire that it's final rating is a resounding "meh".

FUN: building your deck can feel so very rewarding when you churn out combination after combination and rake in the points.

UNIQUE: although it's now been done to death, this the game that put deck-building on the map (even if it was not the first game to use the mechanic).

NEGATIVES: these days I prefer many other deckbuilders to this as they usually feel less mechanical.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Very clever game design. The constant shuffling can be annoying, but the game plays really fast and is very interesting. It's also easy to explain and introduce while still offering lots of different strategies for more advanced players.

RATING: 8
Played 100+ times.

Update II: After 88 games, I lower this from a 10 to an 8. This game was groundbreaking and we´ve had lots of fun with it, but now I find it rather dry. Deckbuilding is best when combined with other mechanics or with a theme.
- - - 
Update: After 14 games, I´m giving this my second `10´ ever (after Aton). I don´t win very often, but I enjoy every minute.

This was the first game I bought after doing much research. I love that this game can be played in 30 minutes. I enjoy trying and finding new combos and strategies to play and with the expansions those combos are endless! If I had one complaint, it would be that certain strategies are kinda overpowered but this is alleviated by some of the cards in subsequent expansions.

Great concept! Played a couple times, and loved it. Played a few more times, and I started to see some issues. Played a few more times, and I started to hate it. This is one of the shallowest games I've ever played. Very addicting at first, but eventually the monotonous gameplay will wear on any serious strategy gamer.

I'm not getting rid of my copy, but the only way I'd play this again is as a gateway game for non-gamer friends and family.

I loved this game at first but with more experience it became pretty dry optimization exercise and so started to feel like work if you wanted to win. I'm up for a game with other casual players every now and then but mostly I'm very burned out. Deckbuilding is a great innovation though.

2-Player Comment:

I never wanted this game because so many compared it to CCG's (I personally dislike CCG's). Other than being composed entirely of cards, I see little in common with CCG's. I bought this after a demo: I like it because you are trying to build a self-sustaining economic engine. Comparing Dominion in any way to a CCG does it a disservice. BUT...Thunderstone is WAY better.

Got the free iOS app; tried it out to see what all the fuss was about. Tried it, ooh, 10 times but found it boring and repetitive. There must be a game here somewhere, but it's hopelessly dislocated from the theme, and is the exact sort of iterative optimization game that rewards intimate knowledge of arbitrary information that I just don't seem to like. Deleted from iPad with no regrets; glad I didn't buy the real thing. Exceedingly happy to discover that I find the deck-building mechanic boring; will doubtless save me much money...

Played 2-player game a couple times, the first two suggested games.  I'm trying to be open minded, but I don't see what the fuss is about.  It's a rush to get the province cards and that's about all.  Both times I couldn't wait for it to be over because it was getting old waiting to get 8 points so I could buy the last province card; I didn't want any more action cards because they weren't very helpful.  I like the idea though of the ever-growing deck of cards, but it didn't make it better than a repetitive exercise of playing cards that seemed largely similar to one another.  I'll still try the other setups, but what am I missing here?  Is it better with more players?  I kept looking at the action cards and thinking 'why would I want this' (e.g., chapel)?  I simply don't see why people like this game so much.

Amazing game.  I was part of a play-test group and played the heck out of the base game before it was even released.  I haven't had a chance to play with the expansions almost at all (though I own them all).  Online play spoiled this game somewhat as face-to-face play now feels slow, what with the shuffling.  I'm treating this like a living card game with each expansion being a cause to pull it out and rediscover the game.  Recently I got the Droid App and have played the living daylights out of it on my commute - great!

I love the fact that it is "collectible" but doesn't require busting open boosters or trading for singles.  I absolutely appreciate the amount of time and effort that is put into playtesting each card, which is why I love all the expansions.  This is one of my favorite board games of all time.  My only negative for this game is that the number of expansions makes this game very difficult to transport.

Good game. Quick and enjoyable, but severely lacking on player interactions, unless you get the expansions, but then you sacrifice control of your deck building for interaction and don't feel that you truly "own" your deck. I'm gonna stick with the basic game. $40 for a set of cards is a lot... let alone $40 for expansions.

Plays different every time.  Perfect for 3 to 4 players.  You can combine with other sets to play with 5 or 6 players, but I find 3 to 4 is optimal.  2 players is still good as well.  The expansions add a lot of depth to the game that can be overwhelming for new players, but still interesting as they try to copy what experienced players do.  The original is simple and fun.

RATING: 6.5
Estimate about 50-100 games played, in person, on isotropic, and against Androdominion AI.

= My standard for judging deckbuilders.
+ Nostalgia for being my first deckbuilder.
+ Variety of card abilities and combos (with sufficient expansions)
- A bit lacking in player interaction. On the other hand whenever I play, I'm happier when I don't see attack cards in the set.
- Big Money strategy feels a bit too dominant.

Revised down from 8 to 6.5. These days, I'd usually rather play something else than Dominion. Main factor is the setup/teardown takes longer than I feel like tolerating.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.3
Played this a few times online. Maybe it's not that representative as in playing face-to-face. It reminds me a lot of Puzzle Strike, but then another theme and a bit less interaction between players. Deckbuilding isn't my type of game: rating can go down or up, but I want to play this a few times more in 'real life' before I give my final rating.

I'd like to try out the different cards, etc. But you don't really have the time to do that (you'll be hopelessly behind in VPs), so it becomes (as in Puzzle Strike) building up credits/dollars/whatever buy-mechanism and buying the best chips/cards (VPs or cards that give you the fastest VPs)...

edit: played it with a friend: this is much better than the internet! It's a nice filler. I won't play it back to back: that makes it boring.

edit2: Dominion is not really my type of game. I have no fun in playing it. Everything you want to just 'try' (odd cards, combos, etc.) sets you up to loose... The only fun I have is the 'sitting around the table with friends' fun.

Brilliant game worthy of a Spiel des Jahres and a top spot within my favorite games! Although I bought this set after Intrigue and Prosperity still I find it very powerful in comparison, with nicer artworks also and a lot of variety added to the title, the gameplay is fast paced, it has easy rules and almost no downtime, setup and put away time can be long though. The replay value of Dominion is high but you'll be soon claiming for some expansions.

Only reason I still play some CCGs is the draft.

This used to make me feel like drafting, but once you decided on a strategy you would be in auto play. One could just almost put the card set choose the buy priorities and let the computer see who wins.

Ascension gives the draft variety that I want in a deck building game.

I understand this games place in the annals of modern boardgaming – but I just don’t like it very much.  I appreciate the design and other’s enjoyment of it, but for me its somewhat painful to play.  I feel compelled to spend 15 minutes at the start of a game constructing the proper strategy/approach (complete with contingencies) and then just go to executing it.  But of course that isn’t good form.  Turns also take (potentially) too long and the amount of interaction is too low for my taste.  Far too focused on optimization for my liking.

RATING: 8
A deck-building game where you start with the same cards and put together a machine that takes you to victory (or defeat).  All the cards are there for your purchase, but first you need to put together enough income generation to fund the exercise.  Once your deck is working smoothly, you should concentrate on getting VPs because (though these cards are useless for all other circumstances) that's the only thing that decides victory in the end.  A good game - very clever and quite innovative.

It is fun to discover a new aspect of gaming, it gave me hope to have a game that can stretch my M:TG itch a bit.

Felt easy to understand the desk building tactics. Not sure if non-gamers could "get it" quickly or not. Too busy shuffling the desk, discarding and drawing, especially when you are playing with three experienced players the turnover time is stressfully short.

A very neat card game which leaves you wanting more.  There has been a lot of hype for this game and it certainly doesn't disappoint.

Very few games over the past few years have left me wanting to play them back to back.  Dominion leaves you with that feeling.  Three games in and I haven't even come close to scratching the surface.  

All the talk about a million of combos is probably true, but I still wish more action cards would have been included in the base set.

I expect the expansions to cost a small fortune in comparison to the base game.  10 bucks for a single group of 10 identical cards is way too much in my opinion.

Probably the best feature of Dominion is trying to solve the puzzle in each game.  There isn't a lot of interaction unfortunately.  The second best feature is the lack of downtime.  The game plays fast even with a slow thinking bunch.

11/18/08 Four-player game using the "new player" set of kingdom cards. The game was better than I expected, After reading beforehand it was somewhat like a CCG, which made me enter into it with much trepidation. Still, a heck of a lot of shuffling. 12/21/08 Three-player game using the Size Distortion set of cards. 02/03/09 Three-player game using the Big Money card set. 04/04/09 Three-player game using a random kingdown deck, including the new Black Market and Envoy cards. 05/19/09 A four-player game that seemed endless as it took two hours and 21 minutes. Dominion is fairly good when it last less than 90 minutes. at 2.3 hours it wears out its welcome.

Like Catan and Carcassone, this is one the genre godfathers. There are other deck-builders out there with plenty of compelling design choices or gimmicks, but Dominion is worth at least checking out.

It really grates with me that, once a player's deck is expended, you then re-shuffle all the cards you've collected, including all the money you've already spent. Wait, what...? I get back the money I spent, having profited from spending it? And further, if I don't spend it, I still have to discard it. There is no incentive not to spend as much money as you can.

Other than this, it's a decent enough filler, but the illogical nature of spending cash really annoys me. I can't understand why it's so highly rated, though. I mean, as I said, it's decent, but it's not great.

I came to Dominion late and with a shrug and like with other huge hobby-altering games it is hard to say anything new.  I certainly appreciate the door it threw wide open for designers, so it has more than earned it's seat in the pantheon.

The game that started the deck building style bonanza. 

Clever and intriguing card game where players start with identical decks used to purchase cards from common stocks to add to their own decks. Used and purchased card are placed in a personal discard pile which becomes the new draw pile when it is empty. Relatively quick games (30-60 minutes with four players), very low degree of player interaction (there are some cards which interacts with other players, but these are few and aren't very likely to be part of a game set-up), virtually a multi-player solitaire where each players tries to create an economic engine. Manages to be fun, stimulating and enthralling in spite of this. 

Update: decreased my score. After more plays the game simply isn't very fun. The card effects and themes seems arbitrarily combined, the mechanics isn't very interesting, too much time is spend shuffling cards, and you can play the game without really paying any attention at all to your co-players. Perhaps an intriguing mechanics but makes for a very dull social exchange and time. 

If you're looking for a game of the kind I much more recommend Quarriors!, which has a very similar but infinitely improved mechanics with some direct player interaction.

I'd never played a deck-building game before this one and I'm still working on getting familiar with many of the strategies, but I'm really, really enjoying playing.  Every game is different with the large selection of possible cards.  I greatly enjoy planning out my deck and watching it come to life.  It's also fun to track the performance of my opponents and try to counteract their strategies.  While we haven't been having as much fun with this game as we have with Race for the Galaxy, we're still  getting a ton of enjoyment out of it, and I doubt that'll change any time soon.

I jumped on the Dominion wagon pretty late (early 2012) and have been thoroughly enjoying it.  I love the quick play, variety of cards with each game, and fairly simple rules for introducing new players.  This has jumped to one of my most-played games very quickly and I don't see that changing any time too soon.  And the fact that my 8-year-old can play it and enjoys it certainly helps.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
My interest in this game started off strong, but it has waned as of late.  I really enjoy finding new strategies and ways to win with different cards.  I think the turn-off for me is too much set-up and upkeep without enough decision-making.  Don't get me wrong, there's definitely thinking involved in card purchases, and sometimes in what to play, but that still is less than 25% of the time you're playing.

*Edit 12/19/11- I have a better opinion of Dominion now that I've mixed in Seaside and Prosperity.  The variety is better, and the different abilities and cards and mechanics in the new set flesh out the experience.  It also helps that I'm not playing it every day, or even every week.

This is the Deck Builder that started it all, and we should all be grateful. 
However, like most games that introduce the genre, nearly every game since has improved on its mechanics. 
Maybe this game is better with the right expansions, but the base game is horribly flawed. 
I will stick to other Deck Builders out there that have better mechanics, better art, and way cooler themes.

RATING: 8
Fantastic card game. It was easy to explain, quick, fun, and rewarding to play.

The card draw over the first few hands can make or break a game depending on the available cards. This has greatly reduced my rating for now. I am considering a variant where each player chooses their cards for the first 2 hands to help alleviate this problem. This is a game breaker in a snowball type of game such as this when the cost of the "Good" cards is such that a bad first hand can put you multiple of the "good" cards behind.

As mentioned in other comments, I don't really like deck builders anymore. Although, Legendary: Aliens looks interesting.

Dominion, while the first of the deck builders, is also the one with no theme. This makes playing it really bland.

I've only ever played this on my computer. As a mindless game in the vein of whatever is your mobile "poison" of choice, this one is certainly better than most (dreck such as CandyCrush etc)! However, I'm not sure I'd ever want to play it in the physical realm... shuffling, people thinking, bah - this is not that kind of game for me - auto-shuffle, play treasures, follow whatever plan you wanted to try out this time, repeat... Win or lose, it's fine, time goes by, no frustration - only the slight "weeeee" as your malleable card-engine does what you want it to! For a physical game, Kingdom builder is my choice every time over this - the same puzzle type of game - only spatial and thus more fun for me.

Maybe expansions will change my opinion, add a bit more spice than just the base set, but meh, can't be bothered unless put in front of me by someone (at which point sure, I'd play).

A fine game.

Rated 9 after one play. I could see this going to a ten or an eight after a dozen or so plays. There seems to be an enormous amount of replay (much like Race or Agricola with the abundance of cards).

Seems strong, well balanced and well playtested. There is a small amount of tediousness with the shuffling, but doesn't detract from the game.

Pretty f'n good.

Update after 20 plays. I'm kind of cooling on this one. It's still fun, but there are other games I'd rather play. I'm putting this down to a safe 7.5.

RATING: 7.5
Game in a Nutshell: Each player attempts to snowball their own small deck of cards into a bigger one that contains the highest total victory points.

Played as: 2,3,4 player

Played with: Base game alone and mixed with Intrigue.

Pros: The rules seem pretty simple to grasp for any type of person and shouldn't take much more than five minutes to explain. I like the fast pace of the game; it seems you're always doing something whether is playing your turn, analyzing your next moves or simply shuffling in between. It all flows so well. There's a great sense of satisfaction in watching your deck grow as the game progresses. And finally, the box insert is simply the best ever.

Cons: With so many different ways to mix the decks, it's inevitable you'll have some dud games. And sure you have a selection of 10 different Action cards to choose from but it seems to me at this point you'll likely pick 3 or so to build your deck with and largely ignore the rest. With two-players, the game seems to end anti-climatically since you know how many victory cards your opponent has bought and at a certain point the results seem inevitable. All the shuffling you'll be doing is going to require card-sleeves if you want it to last.

Other: I wouldn't play this game with two unless I specifically want to have a Dominion fix and that's all the players I have available. There's just better two player experiences out there (Carc, San Juan, etc).

Best Use: An easy to grasp, high-variety card game for 3-4 people.

My penchant for all types of villages and accumulating as many actions as possible has driven by wife and the others that I play with a little batty.  Card combinations and strategy were easy to pick up on given my teenage years playing Magic.

RATING: 9
A simple, yet fun and challenging game. There is some luck with your card shuffles, however it really isn't a significant factor. I like that there really isn't a dominant strategy and one can for the most part counter another's strategy pretty effectively. Adding expansions is the way to go though because they add so many different options and variations to gameplay.

EDIT: Game's rating is a 10 instead of a 9. With the amount of variability in strategies and how light, simple, and good the game is, I feel it deserves the rating considering my non-gamer friends enjoy it (as do I a lot).

I finally got a chance to play this and really like the mechanics and the way the game flows. While I had my butt handed to me, I enjoyed the interaction, the limited downtime (due to fairly fast rounds and some interactive cards) and the surprisingly intricate strategy. It is not a heavy game by any means, and you don't need to know all about the cards to play effectively. Family liked this much more than I thought they would.

Rating for: Base with Seaside, Adventures, Prosperity, Intrigue

Genius mechanics. Great replayability. The expansions add each interesting mechanics each. Very elegant design: Price and effect of cards just feel so balanced. The scoring mechanic is genius: Buy points, but they clutter up your deck - this already made me lose before by choosing the wrong moment to buy points. Wins are so statisfying. Prefer it with 2 or 3. Sometimes feels to solitaire, although during the game you wouldn't notice as you are always busy to think about what to buy or play next.

Good game.  The deck building is very similar to Magic, but instead of people having cards that blow yours out of the water, everyone starts with the same possibilities for a good deck.  The combinations are sure to keep the game interesting for some time.  Please note that I hate the Thief :-)  

Its been a number of years now and at this point Dominion doesn't make the table very often.  It got played out for a time so its the kind of thing I bring back only once in a while.  People have fun when we play but nobody requests it any more

I got a real distaste for this game on the first playthrough. I felt like everyone was zooming through and I was just making one mistake after another. On my second playthrough I won the game, but it didn't win my heart, nor did the genre (I did try a few other deckbuilders). I have to be in a really generous mood to agree to play this game ever again.

Not enough player interaction for me. If the + action + buy + cards + action + action + cards lead to something I would be much happier with the game, but without it I don't really care what my opponents do on their turn other than keeping an eye out for Witch or piles of cards running out.

The game is fun, but there is just something missing for me.

This game sucker punched me, and I'm still angry at it! I thought it was okay and maybe even innovative the first time I played it. But then I played it again.

Jesus, how dull it is once the novelty wears off. The actions are so generic, and playing your turn starts to just feel mechanical after a couple turns. There's so little interaction that I'm not even tempted to talk. It's sort of an antisocial game in that sense: Nothing happens that makes me want to interact with other players.

It's just...dull, dull, dull. I can't believe I thought for even one minute that this was "innovative" or "interesting." Shame on me. It's a freakin' Euro. 'Nuff said.

We've had this for years now and it still sees frequent play. There's a lot of interesting combinations of cards, and some good interaction. It can have issues with low interaction with some card sets. More recent deck building game designs have veered away from the "blank cards" idea, where the VP points water down your deck. While I like the idea that it helps reduce the gap between the leader and other players, dead hands suck.

This is actually my rating for the Dominion series, as I think it's greater than the sum of its parts.  If I were to rate the Original set on it's own, it would be an 8.

Easily our most played game, and definitely our favourite series.  Almost everyone we teach it to loves it.  It often won't 'click' for people until the end of their first game but after that it's simple enough for nearly anyone.  There's a good amount of replayability in it, even if you only have the base game.  If you swap expansions in and out, the replayability is very high.

A compelling "sight reading" game where figuring out the strategy for the particular Kingdom (ie, set of cards) being used is a lot of the game.  Plays fast and is very addictive.  100 plays later and it remains a winner.

Also, it plays shockingly well with my 6-year-old; the ability to play with essentially open hands helps, but the mechanics are not that complex when it comes down to it.

RATING: 7
Night one.  "Want to play Dominion?"  "Of course, this is a really fun game."  Night two.  "Want to play Dominion?"  "Absolutely."  Night three.  "Want to play Dominion?"  "Maybe we could play something else."  "You don't like Dominion, do you?"  We've all been there.  You really like a game, but your game gaming companion likes it even more and doesn't want to play anything else.  They end up feeling hurt and betrayed if you say no and decide you must never want to play the game again.  It is a testament though to just how addictive Dominion is.  The cards have so much variety, with a never ending supply of highly rated expansions.  I enjoy exploring the different cards, because they all seem to offer an advantage if you experiment enough.  The first time I discovered trashing all your cards once you have enough gold, the game was over in a flash and was a landslide.  Try this again though and your competitor may thief you into an obsolescent hand and inescapable poverty.  Changing the cards you use completely changes the nature of the game.  Some of the hands are downright vicious.  Others give you so many victory points you feel like you are in the top 2% of the wealthiest Americans.  Another benefit is that this game is very accessible to non-gamers.  Highly recommended for your slightly less dorky friends.

Update:  Moved back into top 10 with a little help from the under one hour game bump.  That is all we play now!

Have played 50 or 60 games at BSW.  Also have a friend who is addicted to it and have played many with him.

It lacks replayability to me.  Random games see many cards not being used.  I can see the charm, but it isn't high on my list.

Update: I actually got burnt out on dominion because we played so much. It came out every time my family got together (weekly). After about 50 or so plays in a row I finally had to shelf it for a bit. Six months later, I find that I really enjoy pulling this out for a quick 2 player game.

This is our first "boardgame" played with cards. In the beginning we played it several times a day. We never say no to a match, but we seldom choose it ourselves but every time we do we have to play several matches. Dominion is still our most well played game in our gaming evenings. We have played it with 8 persons (even if we think it is best with 3) and had a blast, even though we needed cards from an expansion.

We own every expansion and promo cards that have appeared in finnish thus far. We like this game but it gets boring if you don't get expansions. Basic game has only so much variety so expansion adds to it quite a bit. No game is the same when the action cards change. 

Every table needs to be well thought out before it is played because strategy changes with the table. Experienced gamer sees immidiately how to play to win as his experience with cards and how they interact in the game gives him the advantage in seeing how the game behaves. Sometimes the game is all about money, other times you need to keep on acguiring those action cards. 

When we first got this game, we would have given it 9,5 but we have played it for so long and it's getting boring. It is an easy game to be taught to beginners and old timers still feel the fun in this game.

We have played this with several people and only one hasn't liked it but she doesn't like any other game then Alias...

Cool, new concept. I really like building my engine and seeing my combos "go off" (or not). Some games can be more repetitive than others, depending on length. I think that the victory points are miscosted (6vps should only really be 4vps for 8$), but that's pretty minor. Very difficult to resist saying 'let's play one more, but this time, replacing this card with that other card' - which is the sign of a great game. 
Update: Raised rating fro 7.5 to 8 after 20+ plays... deliciously short, simple and *addictive*

Great game. After dozens of plays still want to play it and willing to infect newcomers at all times. Though it tires out a bit if you play it too many times in a row always with new people. ;)

Everyone starts with the same set of ten cards and through the course of the game builds a larger/stronger deck of cards with various actions/abilities with which to gain the ever popular victory points.  Most points wins.

It's easy to teach and play.  Play time is relatively short: 20 to 40 minutes depending on the number of players and how familiar everyone is with the game.  The variability is fantastic.  The game comes with 25 sets of main cards of which you use only 10 per game.  Familiarizing yourself with each individual card is the "hardest" part of the game.  And there are numerous expansion all adding variety and additional combinations of cards.

There are some aspects that may or may not be good depending on your perspective.  When using the base set alone, there is very little player interactivity.  Only two or three cards directly affect the other player(s).  Other expansions (see Dominion Intrigue below) offer more of this.  And the theme is fairly non-existent; it's mostly a numbers game, but not mathy.

With its low complexity, quick play time, and seemingly infinite (especially with expansions) variety, this is an easy choice to pick up and enjoy.

[u]24-01-2014[/u]:  This is another game that hasn't been hitting the table in recent months.  My daughter and I still really like it, but my collection just has too many options these days, I suppose.  I still think it's a very good game that really pioneered the deckbuilding genre.  Very light on theme but smooth playing and lots of variability.

Dominion is one of those games where I recognize the effort that went into the design and I acknowledge that it may be a great game.  It just doesn't do anything for me. Thought about adding the base game to my collection to play with my family, but I feel the money would be better spent elsewhere.

Changed my rating to reflect my lack of enthusiasm for the game.

RATING: 7
I got into the deck building genre a little late, so while Dominion does hold its own and has aged pretty well, there are a lot of more specialized deck builders out there to suit your taste. Dominion is still flexible enough with expansions to hold its own, but I guess I'm just not a big fan of the deck-building genre.  Would play when in the mood.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
We like Dominion - scales equally well with 2, 3 or 4.  At 8 years old it's still a great series, but lack of overall theme and other games now in this genre, it is no longer our go-to deck builder.  

The cards are ok, but they're not card-art that make you just stare in appreciation.  It's well done, but not great.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Was afraid this would be another Race to the Galaxy type game but instead I found something quite unique.  It's a deck-building game and it's quite fun.  I'm not a fan of traditional CCG deck-building but here it happens real time.  You're playing cards from your hand which give you actions, etc. then buying new cards which go to your discard pile.  When your turn is over any cards played or unplayed (from you hand) go to the discard pile.  The pile is then shuffled when your deck runs out.  Note: lots of shuffling!  

The most important decision of the game is when to stop building your engine and use it to start collecting VPs.  Often this may be decided by another player who starts the VP grab but timing is important since VP cards go into your deck too and gum-up your hand.  

There are a number of "kingdom" decks that can be used (10 of 25 used in a game) and I was pleasantly surprised how different the game felt with the various combinations that I've tried.

RATING: 7
The original incarnation of the deck-building mechanic that became so popular.  Card-based approach so reminiscent of CCGs -- gets the M:tG fanboys out of the wood work.  I thoroughly enjoy playing this through, however I sometimes get the feeling that the people who get hard core into this are a bit like the dedicated RftG folks -- concentrate too much on one thing they like (i.e. card games).  Like to play (with all the expansions), but would not want to own.

*************** Update July 2010

Thunderstone probably has Dominion beat in fun factor terms, but Dominion is still a decent game.  I think I have about played this out, but will revisit from time-to-time.  After playing this and Thunderstone a couple of times, I have gained more of an appreciation for how Magic in a limited format plays.  Magic drafts, especially cube drafts, are more entertaining/challenging.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
[b]First play:[/b] Oh yeah. Very compelling; I wish I could have played six or seven more times. Very quick for an "engine" game, so there's that adjustment to be made. And there's weird tactics like throwing victory points in the trash that you don't see anywhere else. But more than that, the quickness ensures that there is not one over-arching strategy, that you really do have to adapt to the particular cards in play. This in turn entails a steeper learning curve. I'm in. [But I like Race better.]


...a year later, in which I've spent a large fraction of my gaming time playing Dominion, (and learned essentially nothing) I'm raising my rating to 10. I really feel sorry for folks who feel that they can only give one game a 10 - I think Dominion is great; if I like Race better, that doesn't change anything. Of course, the game is broken, as there is a killer strategy: don't make suboptimal moves! Oh, that's genius! Why didn't I think of that?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Played it several times. It is fun but it seems to depend a lot on the cards that you allow into the game. I have been thinking about buying it but it didn't convince me that much to pay the full price for it. Maybe one day, when i'm less picky or more rich. :)

Update: Kingdom Dominion is ideal solution for me!

RATING: 7
I'm a bit tired of the need for earning more actions and buys. Also the static availability of the 10 stacks is somewhat boring, once people know the basic strategies. Ascension is way more fun (and way more addictive) with random availability of only six cards and being allowed to play and buy as much as I want.

Also, putting victory points in your deck is a clever constraint. Unfortunately it is also frustrating since one would rather have a sleek and powerful deck.

This game is bar-none an absolute classic. What I look for in a 10 game is one that I can see myself in 10, 15, 20 years breaking out and playing with my future kids. This is a game that scratches that CCG itch that I have had for years and also is incredibly diverse and easy to pick up for new players. The game plays great with 2 and scales great up to 6 (with expansion). The card drafting renaissance owes it's relevance to Dominion. Great idea. Great game.

The one that started the craze, and still better than its expansions due to the simplicity.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great idea. Although I would like either more interaction, or more simultaneous thinking... the fact I will receive many cards during my turn (using Village, Smithy, Council room etc.) prevents me from planning my turn while others are playing, and as there is not too much interaction, I just have to wait while others are playing their own game...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Played it a couple of times and enjoyed it. It's fun and it plays fast. However I agree with what Sam Healy said in the Top Ten Overrated games the dice tower did: it's not THAT good.

On the other hand, I disagree with them (and a lot of people, apparently) regarding the theme: I think it's there; the deck you build is the realm, the victory points being the prestige or fame or whatever, and the buildings being... buildings :P and they do feel flavorful: the village or whatever it was called giving you extra cards represents that the more people in your kingdom, more stuff you can do (or faser), the festival giving you an extra purchase and gold and action represents the positive effects those had (and still do) for the place that implements them, etc
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Awesome game. Works well with any number of players. Lacks a bit in player interaction sometimes depending on which cards are in use, this becomes a non-issue when played with one or more expansion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a great fast paced game.  I normally don't like the amount of luck in card games, so when I saw the components for this was 500 cards I was put off.  Needless to say, it took me a while to finally buy it.  I really enjoyed my first play through, and after my second I was hooked.

The game starts everybody off with 10 cards, 7 treasure cards, called copper, and 3 victory point cards, called estates.  You are trying to build up your kingdom to be the winner.  You have 25 different kingdom cards, or action cards, to choose from.  Of those 25 each game will use 10.  There are a few defined sets in the rules, the first one being a beginners set that introduces you to most of the types of cards, or you can pick your favorite 10, or you can randomly pick the 10 to use, or any other mechanism you want to choose the 10 kingdom cards to play with.  You then start using your money to buy cards, hopefully you are buying cards that make your deck stronger.  The actions will help you play more actions(so you can chain actions), draw more cards, have extra money to spend, attack other players, etc.  The ultimate goal is to get a deck good enough so you can buy the big victory point cards, called provinces.  When the provinces run out, or any other 3 stacks of cards, the game ends and you count up your points.

I really enjoyed this when I first got it.  We were playing a lot though, so I kind of got burned out.  I still love to play it, but I'm not playing 5+ games a day now like I was at first.  I gave this an 8 because I think I'll be able to pick this game up about any time and play it, plus it is easy to teach, and gamers and non-gamers a like enjoy playing this.  At work on our lunch break we can easily get in 3 games and a lot of times we play 4 in the hour.  This is a classic and I can't wait for the first expansion, Intrigue.

Hmmmm I like the mechanics. But not sure I like the gameplay... not enough interaction but the interactive cards slow down the game and make it fiddly. 

The game  seems to go on way too long (noob talking) and the graphics are poor IMO. Why on earth do cooper, silver and gold not have different images or colours at the least!?!?

Frankly, as with other card games, I just don't get the hype. I like the mechanics but don't feel as if the game does justice to them.

May the most efficient VP engine win.  Strangely addictive for a game in which the primary mechanic is card drafting... and building up the best deck.

Setting the game up takes a little too much time considering how fast the game plays. It feels like your setting it up half of the time. Usually, there are several very popular cards and a few possible strategies, while several cards just lie unused.

It's rather accessible, which can make it useful among casual gamers, but I think it's more than a bit overrated. With hardcore gamers I prefer other games.

It seems appropriate that they made a f2p version, since buying gold is the key to winning.

As a game you can "learn" and improve at it's terrible. Have fun reading and memorizing card combos on strategy guides. That's the real game. Also learn how to keep track of the score either in your head (super fun with 4 players) or with notes. If you don't, you'll lose. Why that's kept "secret" is beyond me, as without knowing the score there's no real strategy.

Yes and no. Dominion is quick and enjoyable, and my kids often request this. 

But .... 
1) choices are just choices not dilemma's (as in what I consider good games).

RATING: 9
Rating applies to my Dominion collection (everything but Alchemy).  

Card flow is fun.  Down time is minimal.  Thinkiness is medium-light.  Enough to think, but not so much that I'd ever feel too mentally tired to play.

Really, it's the card flow that mostly does it for me.  But of the deck building style games I've played, this feels far more polished than the others.  It can bog down with slow games, but also bogs down less than the others I've played.

This game is nearly perfect.  This is the nit-picky part where I talk about what could be changed to push this game from great to absolutely fantastically super amazing awesomeness.  It's missing interaction, and interesting decisions.  

Interaction is partially accomplished by attack and reaction cards; but more so by the race for VP feel.  It could use more interesting reactions on other peoples turns.  

There's a fair amount of decision making in the buy phase, though maybe more ways to attain victory would spice this up.  Where interesting decisions is typically lacking is the action phase.  Most of the time, there's really only one obvious best way to play your cards.  However, each expansion improved upon this, giving you multiple different choices to make, and positive rewards for building variety into your deck.  

One amazing thing about Dominion is how easy it is to add your own fan content to the game to steer in more in the direction of what makes the experience fun for you.

Dominion-Vanilla (base game) = good
Dominion-Intrigue = good
Dominion-Seaside = AMAZING!
Dominion-Prosperity = Great
Dominion-Alchemy = Overall bad (but with 1 great card)
Dominion-Cornocopia = Great
Dominion-Hinterlands = Great
Dominion-Dark Ages = Great
Dominion-Adventures = AMAZING!!

At first I liked Prosperity most, and we always played with Colony/Platinum.  But after playing more and more games, I am on the fence as to if the game is better for high level play with or without them.  I used to thing they were hands down better, but honestly they are not.

A truly innovative and inspiring game. Many people thank Dominion for its contribution but have since replaced it with his progeny. I still think it's the best. The focus is on the engine, the perfect deck, not theme or chance or tactics or monsters. The expansions offer near-infinite permutations of kingdom cards, both supplying replayability and forcing players to develop new strategies on the fly for each combination. Perhaps not everyone needs to own it, but everyone should play it.

My first foray into a card-drafting game.  Loved it.  Enjoyed Magic the Gathering as a kid, but then came to loathe the mechanic of "he who buys the more real-world-expensive card wins".  Card drafters get around that nicely - everyone playing off the one set.

Dominion is a deck-building game. Players start out with an identical set of 10 cards, and draw 5 of them. They then can buy a series of Kingdom Cards (10 types per game), Currency (Copper, Silver and Gold) and finally Victory Cards (Estate, Duchy and Province). They then take turns buying, shuffling, buying, shuffling, and so on. 

Who knew a game sounding so monotonous could be so fun, but it is! What makes it fun is as the game progresses, the players begin to have more and more distinct decks. Soon you'll have cards that play (or combo) off of other cards and one turn you'll end up playing 7+ cards, often gaining multiple kingdom cards or money, or if lucky the treasured Province cards.

I recommend this game to even the most unseasoned board game player.

You won't see another game in my "Previously Owned" section with half as many plays as this sacred cow of BGG, and it even surprised me a little that I was able to cull it from my collection.  I think many games do owe this a debt of gratitude, because deckbuilding (whether it be cards, dice, or whatever) has become a favorite mechanic of many a designer.  What I realized was that I enjoyed it as one of [i]several[/i] aspects to a game, rather than the featured performer.  So off this went.

Overall a good game. Nice components, although I'm not sure how much replayability there is, despite the different combinations of cards that are possible each time you play it. I suppose that I'll have to play it more than once to see if it's good enough to play more than once. I liked it more the second time, but after three plays, I'm finding I don't like it all that much. It just doesn't seem all that exciting or have much depth to it.

I like this game because it is relatively short and has very simple turns (players draw five cards, get one action, and one purchase) yet still manages to be a fairly complicated strategic/tactical game.  Players all start the game with identical hands, drawing five cards from their draw pile at the start of each turn.  On each turn players choose which cards they want to buy; bought cards get added to their discard pile, which quickly gets reshuffled into their draw pile.  Thus, players get to build their own custom decks, and then use them (and continue adding cards to them) in the same game over and over.  I love the idea!

The game is customizable by having different sets of cards that can be bought; the different sets of cards drastically change the feel of the game.  I didn't like the interactive set, though, as the one game I played of that slowed to a crawl.

There is definitely an element of luck to the game, though, as especially near the end of the game the order a player's cards are drawn in will dictate what they can do.  But given the speed with which the game goes by in, that's OK.

Card game where you build your deck as the game progresses.  Involves strategic choices, but can be played in half an hour.  Different kingdom cards can be used in separate games to give variations almost equal in number to Cosmic Encounter.  Should play with at least one attack card set in the mix to avoid multi-player solitaire.

RATING: 8
Draft and play cards to improve your deck and collect victory cards for most points.

Plays: More than 500, counting online play against humans and AI.
Type: VP engine = a game where you build an engine to collect victory points most efficiently.
Complexity: Light.
# of players: 2-4.
Playing time: 45 mins.
Player interaction: Competition for scarce resources – action and victory cards. Sometimes conflict, which always affects all opponents equally.
Randomness: Low – card draw, but you decide what cards make up your deck.

Replayability: Very high. Often everyone wants to play again immediately. There are millions of variations because the design is modular, so no game is exactly the same. There is also depth to explore.
Fun: High. Making high value hands is fun. Drawing your entire deck with action cards is even more fun. The endless shuffling is not so fun.
Memorability: High, you’ll remember the wicked combo that you managed to get off that one time to buy three Provinces and a Duchy. You’ll start remembering the less spectacular ones as well after a while, hoping for your pet cards to appear in the Kingdom next time.

Thematic integration: Strained.
Components: Not so good unfortunately. Cards are good quality, but the art is bland.
Expansions: Expansions in order of increasing complexity/fiddlyness: Hinterlands, Cornucopia, Seaside, Prosperity, Dark Ages, Alchemy. Get Hinterlands first.

Who will like this: Family gamers that want to do a bit more thinking.

A game that almost everyone in my groups loves but I abhor. It's themeless, dry work putting together the best part of most CCGs (engine building) and then never getting to turn the key to see how it runs. Most later deck-builders do it far better, in my opinion.

One of the best games I've ever played.  Addictive.  Very fun.  Highly Recommended.

House Rules for those with all the expansions:

Play one round.  After that round each person replaces one of the stacks with one from any expansion.  Only cannot replace stack just placed by another person.

I would consider Dominion to be another 'Gateway Game'. While it serves as a great gateway to the hobby itself, it also stands as a gateway to deckbuilders, a genre of boardgames.

Deckbuilders allow players to gain cards from communal sources, adding these new cards to their own personal deck of cards. You are effectively building your own deck. 

Dominion is immensely replayable, as a result of its almost endless combinations of cards. 

I wish there were a little more player interaction, but it's otherwise an interesting game with a wide variety of options.

Great deck-builder (as many will testify).  Setup is quite fiddly, though, compared to some.  Theme is pretty much absent. The variable setup is a double-edged sword- adds a ton of replayability, but also makes it so the game is pretty much decided at the beginning when you think through the best combos with this particular set, and then play the game on autopilot. But can still be fun as long as I don't play too often.

Quick, tactical and strategic. A lot of fun for a half hour game. Looking forward to some of the expansions. Update: Got the Prosperity expansion, lifts Dominion to a 9. I play mostly with my wife - we haven't tried any of the other expansions, but Prosperity expands and enhances the overall experience. Since adding the expansion I think this will be our goto card game for a while.

Update: THE best game you can play in a half hour. I now have the Prosperity and Seaside expansions. This is probably our most played game. It's not the deepest game, but there is strategy, and it's action, action, action! With only two players it moves right along, always engaging, never a lull. It's card game crack and I love it.

Update: Prefer Thunderstone.

RATING: 10
So far I find the game mechanics more interesting and impressive than fun. The jury is still out.

After a few more plays I've warmed to it a bit. It's not boner of the month or anything, but it's a solid 7 for me.

Dominion has been steadily growing on me. Intrigue helped a lot.

80 plays later, maybe it IS boner of the month.

I really prefer Dominion as a 2-player game with expansions. It's quick and focused, and my rating is for the 2p game. Adding more players increases the playing time, but doesn't really add anything good.

Why can't I quit you? Dominion is now a 10. The 10 rating is for the game system, not the base game by itself.

Less than impressed at first, [i]Dominion[/i] grew on me significantly as I played more and more games (mostly two-player). It definitely has that "let's play another" quality; it's not unusual for us to play five or six times in a row. The Action-Attack cards make the game more fun, whether or not there's a blue defensive card in play. Favorite kingdom cards from the base game: Adventurer, Bureaucrat, Chapel, Militia, Mine, Moneylender, Throne Room, Witch. [154 total plays, including many using expansion cards from [i]Intrigue, Seaside, Prosperity,[/i] and promos (own all but [i]Seaside[/i])]

RATING: 5
An interesting game with some quirky card buy mechanics. The real strength, however, seems to come in figuring out how to build one's deck so that during one's turn, a chain-reaction of card playing is triggered. I think at one point during my first game, I played through every single card in my deck, and had somewhere around 20+ in money for card buys.

Ok. After 30 plays, the majority of which are IRL (since I get annoyed by the LACK of interaction, tabletalk, and metagaming on BSW) I have to admit I am fully and completely hooked. This is currently my preferred game and I am suggesting it above any other game - it fits the sweet spot - plays in under 30 minutes (and about half the time under fifteen), is strategic, there are plenty of difficult and interesting choices, and lots of chances to mess with others (indeed I am now at a point where I can specialize my decks specifically to mess with others and when done right, I can even still pull off a victory at the same time.)

Edit: a ratings bump after introducing it to my wife. "Hey, I actually really like this game. So there are more action cards we can play with? I totally would play this again!"

---------

This game is losing it's shine after 60+ plays. It feels rote. I have plumbed the depths of the various strategies presented by particular kingdom cards (and the combos they make available), and win about 90% of the games as a result. It's stopped being fun somewhere along the way, and I've definitely stopped thinking during game play - my choices are almost tacit.

I realize the expansion would probably infuse some new life into this situation, but why should I invest in such an expansion only for this to happen again.

It's still a good game, but it's lack of staying power keeps it from being a great game.

----------------------

Having now played the recent expansion I can say without reservation that this is essentially a ccg. As such it will only stay fresh with the expansions. Even then, I have not lost a game of it in three months because the best and fastest path to victory is always the same. It's a pity because the mechanics are genius. But in the end, I refuse to buy expansions. I REFUSE. And so the game, I suspect, will continue to fade.

-----------------------

Uh, ok. So both my mom and my dad like this. Seriously. And it wasn't me who first taught them how to play it - it was my brother-in-law (who I taught.) Go ye therefore and teach all men. Go figure.

-----------------------

Without continuing to buy expansion after expansion of this, it starts to feel really rote and uninteresting. It's basically Deck: The Shuffling.

No question for me that it's great fun to play. I've upgraded my rating because of the novelty of the system design. There is great potential here.

I like dominion, I genuinely do but we've found if you simply buy silver coins each round until it's starts popping up in your hand, then do the same with gold, then buy up province after province it's an easy win. The occasional thief card slows this down but it doesn't stop it. For me the option to buy game currency is a bit silly as it negates the use of a lot of the kingdom cards. A fun game let down by a very basic gaming mechanic. 

Upgraded half a point to an 8. In time after playing many other deck builders you realize just how influential Dominion is. Yes I still stand by my buy silver/gold/province claim (I avoid this tactic to make it fun) but the positives of this game far exceed the negatives. Simple, elegant (getting tired of 'fiddly' games now) and engaging from start to finish, Dominion has to be respected and admired.

At first this card game looks intimidating because it has 500 cards.  Didn't understand what the randomizer cards were at first because the instructions don't describe it well and first thought cards were missing (but did figure it out thanks to BoardGameGeek). Once my fiance' and I got past all the cards and into the mechanics it was easy to understand, yet challenging to play without being intimidating.  Would definitely play again.

After playing Dominion nearly 200 times, I was about ready to rate it a 4 (I really did have to be talked into it), but I left it at a 6 in honor of all the prior plays it had gotten. Games had gotten stale, pretty much a quick puzzle of picking one or two cards that would help get me to Gold (and then Provinces) the fastest, then waiting around while others fiddled with their decks, stringing together long chains of cards (that got increasingly insane with every expansion). I'd still win at least half the time. I really thought I was pretty much done with Dominion.

But here we are, a few years later, and I have rediscovered the game! Not only has Big Money weakened as more expansions came out, it's not even the optimal strategy on the very first game most people play. I threw down an additional 100 plays trying to build engines and work combos I'd never before considered. The game is newly challenging and even after 300 logged plays (see Intrigue), I still want more! Phenomenal.

As for the original set itself, many of these cards remain essential, if a little bland, with Chapel and Gardens probably being the most exciting. I've redistributed most of these cards into homebrew variants of the expansions, but a considerable chunk of these cards have been consigned to a special set ("Dominion: Purgatory") that will get played rarely. Even though all that averages out to ~7 in terms of my willingness to play these cards in the future, I can't deny the hours upon hours of enjoyment I've gotten from them in the past, so I'm going to leave my rating at an 8.

[i]Note: Between this and Alchemy, I've logged an even 200 plays. Hereafter, I'm recording all further plays under Intrigue. Peace out.[/i]

It's fun building a little perpetual motion machine.  The theme seems pasted on, and isn't that evocative to me.  There is plenty of replay value because of the combination of cards.

From incidental comments, I expected this to be like Race for the Galaxy, but upon finally trying it, it's not. They're both card games, where each player works on an individual tableau, but if anything, Dominion's CCG-style deck building makes a lot more like a version of Saint Petersburg where only 5 of your cards are active at a time.

You use (not really spend) your money/income cards to buy new action, money, or VP cards which get shuffled into your deck. Since the cards only come up 5 at a time, it's more important that your collection of cards be efficient than large. The other interesting tradeoff is that VP cards take up space in your deck, stealing valuable hand space from income and actions if too many are acquired too early.

Great game, but the cards get old real quick and strategys are hard to pull yourself away from if it is winning. Does not force you into taking different paths.

If you went first and take the last Province, you immediately end the game......that seems lame to me.

I still suck at dominion to the point that I'd probably do better sticking with Big Money strategy (only taking money and victory points). But the deckbuilding and card interactions are interesting and satisfying enough for me to forget that.

The expansions are crucial to making dominion its best, with cards that interact in crazy ways and provide more decisions. Lack of player interaction might be a problem for some but at least at higher level play, player interaction is huge.

I love this game. Very clever. I've played many games with varied set-up options, or game changing mechanisms that purport to make 'every playing different', but none have done so as cleverly as this one. 

Downgraded to a 7. Repeated plays has significantly decreased its attraction.

The original deck-builder. A solid beginning. I see the resemblance to other favorites, but there's something to be said for its purity. And I think when people say it's themeless, they're selling it short. It's not the strongest in the world, but it's there.

The original deck builder that is pure genius in its simplicity and in its execution.  Play balance is almost guaranteed, as every player has the same cards to choose from. It is so engaging to build an engine and watch it pay off.   Card synergies are fun to find and execute, as are new mechanics introduced by the expansions.  Can feel very different from game to game depending on the kingdom cards used.

In the fall of 2012, I joined some folks at work playing Dominion during lunch.  This is how I was introduced to modern hobby boardgames. I loved Dominion and played many times before I started recording plays here.  It is an excellent design.  It plays fast and when you see other players scooping up the high-victory point cards, it creates a great feeling of tension.   In the end, Dominion is a bit of a one-trick pony, but it is an awfully good trick!

The game to end all games.  Dominion started the entire Deckbuilding Genre as far as I'm concerned, and it's still one of the Top3.

I've played a lot of dominion.  Alot.  I have it on my phone.  It's a great game for getting people into the hobby.  But Dominion has a flaw.

There is almost NO player interaction. None.  Each player does their own thing, building little Utopian worlds, while ignoring the other players.  Even the attacks- where the interaction should be don't really give meaningful choices.  It took me a long time to come to this conclusion... I'd say 20 game hours, at least, probably more.  But for me, unless I'm Gateway drugging people into board gaming, I probably won't play dominion of my own volition ever again.  I feel like everyone involved just plays solitaire for 10-20 minutes and then reports who won quickest.

This game system is just plain fun- easy to learn and the fact that the card mix is different every time helps prevent "killer strategies."  I'm sure if you play it enough, those will develop anyway, but so far that hasn't happened with our group.

I loved Dominion, and then I didn't like it as much and now I find that I like it pretty well.  (Specific aren't I?)  I loved the card drafting mechanic and thought the possibilities were endless because of all the card choices but I think the dry theme turned me off a bit.  I still enjoy the game and I think about purchasing some expansions to see if I can enliven it somewhat but at this point I would rather play Legendary.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I love this game most as a two player game. It is a race to end the game in a leading position. Endless variations of the decks that are in use bring replayability beyond my wildest dreams. Plus that, with all the expansions this just keeps going and going and going.

De valahogy nekem nincs kedvem eljutni idáig.

A great game without doubts. However, having the online version spoiled it for us =(
More precisely, we find the setup (choosing of the 10 cards) and setdown (dividing all the played cards into the original stacks) is overly long compared to the duration of one match. Especially if you want to change the 10 cards that get laid on the table between one match and the other.

Even though these kind of mechanics are kind of overused nowadays, Dominion keeps entertaining. Game just flows really well and it's a good gateway game to deck building games.

UPDATE: Ugh! Far too long for what it is, insular, and just boring. You can't pay me to care about what the otherr players are doing, so the game just devolves into multiplayer solitaire without anything even being on the board. Yes, some random player effects hit you, but so what? Will actively avoid from now on.

Neat, innovative game, but I don't understand the hype.  I'm sure I need to play more, but it's yet another Euro that throws obstacles in your way and then gives you cards to get rid of them.  I don't actually feel like I'm building anything here. More plays will tell.

Have played three times, and I'm still not entirely convinced.  Seems like at least 75% of the time the best move is to buy money (early) or buy victory points (late).  Action cards are not powerful enough in my book.  Trying to keep an open mind...

RATING: 8
Overall, I enjoy the base Dominion game.  The games go relatively quickly, it's easy enough for non-gamers to pick up, and there's enough strategic depth there to keep me interested.

My only knock against the game is that while the first 3/4 of each game -- the engine-building/optimizing part -- was always great fun, after not too many plays the end game province rush started to feel stale.  There just weren't many decisions to make at that point: if treasure > 8, buy province; if treasure > 5, buy duchy.  Prosperity fixed this for me.

The classic deck builder that started this genre of games and as such deserves to be as iconic as Magic: The Gathering.

Essentially players are trying to win as many VPs as they can but to reach the higher valued VP (Province) cards they will need to build there deck with higher valued gold cards and acquire other cards from the many on offer to make use of special actions and powers.

What sets Dominion apart is the variety of cards available in the game and each expansion. 

Not all card sets are used with each play so the game offer loads of re-playability and the fun is really in exploring the card sets and finding the combos.

Easy to learn, pretty thematic neutral and tends to appeal to both genders where other like titles such as Ascension and Thunderstone may not.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very fun game if you dont play other collectable card game such as Magic the Gather, World of Warcraft TCG, Yugioh etc. Otherwise, this game becomes very repeatitive as experienced players know which cards to get right from the setup.. eventually it will turn into a battle to see who can get the most of those 1 or 2 piles of cards. Only recommend for people that wants a refresher on card games, but if you already are playing a TCG game.. give this one a pass.

Игра очень интересная, и очень умная. Конечно, взаимодействия маловато. Реиграбельность огромная. Самый большой недостаток — игра черезчур абстрактна, картинки слабо вяжуться со свойствами карт.

Everybody I've introduced this game to has enjoyed it, and most of them have wanted to play again immediately.

I would wonder if it would be improved if more hands had "play" to them (tactical decisions to be made during the action phase), but on the other hand, it might just make the game heavier and less likely to hit the table.  Perhaps we'll see when Intrigue is released.

Update 26/8/2017: (920 games played). Each expansion adds something significant and makes the game even better for me. My favorite expansion is Empires. 

This game is seriously addictive. I keep playing and playing.This is currently, by far my, favorite game. 
The more I play the more I realize how well designed this game is and how carefully the expansions have been planned and implemented. 
You can custumize this game according to your preferences. It can be from very simple to quite complex. You can choose a completele random setup using all the expansions, or carefully choose the expansions and additional rules that you prefer. 
The more I play this game the more I appreciate its beuty.

Spiel des Jahres 2009

First play was a little long as we had to learn the cards and basic mechanism. The game starts slowly but really accelerates as you build your engine. This was very enjoyable and I look forward to try different combinations and mixing in expansions.

Multiple plays on iOS. This game is very addictive despite its extremely "mechanic" nature.

The de facto "deck builder". I really like the game and enjoy deck builders. My wife is not a huge fan of deck builders so we'll see how much action this game gets over the years. I very much enjoy the game. It's simple to teach and learn and plays quickly.

Nice card game, something new to play for a few games. Quick game, very dynamic and addicted. I enjoy to play it, but i don't like the constant card shuffle. Very nice box insert for all the cards.

My game is open, but the cards are yet in shrink.

I will trade this one for any edition of Dune or Prophecy - Traded.

Update (30/12/11): Have played this a lot now - immensely replayable, and really fun, and only 45 mins per game. Has a tension to it - plays fast and has tremendous variation. All gamers should own a copy.

Ordered October 31st, 2008

Now that I've played this game 30+ times, I just can't get enough of it.  This game will give Race to the Galaxy a run for it's money, as it seems now the board game world is having a run of card games (i.e RttG, Dominion, Keltis)  This game is not to be compared with RttG, as it's a totally different game.  This reminds me more of St. Petersburg than anything, but with a higher replay factor.
The 25 different cards are what give this game a new experience every time.  One game you could score 49 points, the next -6.  This game is hot and is only going to continue to rise.  I see it being a top 10 in a few months time.
My fan favorite has to be the witch.  I love dealing out curses, (or in German Fluch).

I'm usually not a friend of deck building games, since they often boil down to who knows the different cards and combinations best. However, Dominion was a pleasant surprise for several reasons:

1. The card types used in every game are limited and known to all players.
2. The card effects are simple and clearly written.
3. The turns are quick and the games are short.
4. Yoy can play both tactically (how do I play my current hand best) and strategically (how should I build my deck to get the hand I want).
5. You do get "big" moments as you play out powerful combinations.

The less good things are still acceptable.

1. Non-existent theme, (Oh, we were playing Kings?)
2. A lot of shuffling (but between turns).
3. Enough cards for all players, limiting interaction limited to occasional card stealing.

A good filler game but nothing I would devote an entire game evening to.

我的第一款桌遊!好玩的建立牌庫遊戲!建立自已的王國用的是手牌建構，而非一般地圖擺放圖版的方式來建立王國，令人耳目一新，分數卡、計策卡、金幣卡的設置，很有用謀略建立王國的策士精神，卡牌套用建設國家的主題恰如其分。例如行動卡就好像是執政者利用各式各樣的人士參與決策或工作，或進行重大公共設施或政策的推行。金幣簡單說就是國家的經濟力，國家經濟力越強越有能力推行重大建設或聘請有力人士。最後國家的整體實力，就是遊戲過程中購買外匯(分數卡)的表現。

RATING: 8
I remember this being a lot more interesting with some of the expansions mixed in, as it can get stale rather quickly with just the base cards. Best played quickly, as most of the choices are made at the beginning deciding which cards you will buy, and then adjusted on the fly as you see how the reality compares to the plan (along with how your card draw works out). Interaction is minimal, although in some setups you will be forced to react to the attack cards your opponents are buying. 1-3-13

I play this game with the whole family. It was my favorite game for a long time, but we overplayed it and I'm taking a bit of a break. Ended up buying the master game and all the expansions at once, which saved a ton of dough.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A wonderful game, open to infinite combinations of starting cards and striking a wonderful balance of luck and skill, allowing a decent player to tip the odds in their favour while still being susceptible to the vicissitudes of fate.  Quick play is a bonus, and, with this quality, it has racked up many plays in our house.

Expanded in 2013 to include Prosperity gives the game much more scope than the slightly restricted base set.  Bigger money and more varied powers along with Colonies alter the balance of the game, and the random setup makes for a different feel each time.

Expanded in 2014 to include Intrigue.

I'm conflicted about this game. I know it's good, but I just can't figure it out. The deckbuilding feels strange to me. Often when I lose, I have no idea what I did wrong or could have improved and that makes it frustrating to learn. I think I would prefer to play 7 Wonders instead of this.

RATING: 7.5
Dominion a vraiment réussi à devenir un incontournable des jeux que nous possédons. La rejouabilité est à la fois pratiquement illimitée et beaucoup moins dispendieuse que d'autres types de jeux "deck building" tel, bien sûr, Magic.

Longue vie à Dominion et à ses expansions!

2014-04 EDIT: L'envie d'y jouer s'est estompée depuis plus d'un an, et ma note initiale (8.2) a été revue à la baisse: 7,7 en décembre 2013, puis 7,5.

2015-06 EDIT: Beaucoup de parties jouées depuis décembre 2014, ce qui vient contredire le précédent "edit". Ayant revu plusieurs de mes ratings à la baisse, je donnerais un gros 8,5 à Dominion pour l'importance que ce jeu a pris (et continue de prendre) dans l'univers des jeux - particulièrement des decks building. 

Toutefois, il est clair à mes yeux que le seul jeu de base n'est pas suffisant pour rester un très bon jeu après quelques parties. La rejouabilité de Dominion Base est questionnable, tant Big Money a de l'importance et tant plusieurs setup donnent des parties assez drabes. On dirait que la grande majorité des parties doivent passer par quelques incontournables (Chapel, Smithy, Laboratory, Witch) et qu'un trop grand nombre de Kingdom Card ne sont pas clairement supérieures à Silver dans de nombreuses situations - d'ailleurs plusieurs cartes ont été "améliorées" dans d'autres expansions.

En fait, je conseillerais à un joueur désireux de se lancer dans l'acquisition de Dominion d'acquérir dès le départ deux expansions (Intrigue puis au choix Hinterlands, Seaside, Prosperity, Alchemy, Guilds ou Cornucopia - mais peut-être pas Dark Ages ou Adventures dès le départ). Et s'il me posait la question: "Et Dominion Base?", je ne suis pas certain de ce que je lui réponderais. 

J'attribue donc 7,75 à Dominion Base (contrairement à 8 pour la plupart des autres expansions).

2016-12 EDIT: Si l'intérêt général pour Dominion connait des hauts et quelques bas, je constate que même lorsque j'ai envie d'y jouer, je n'ai pas envie de sortir la boite de base. 7,75 -->7.

RATING: 7
The deck builder that started them all.  Innovative mechanics, lovely art, very abstract theme (possibly too abstract), and unfortunately has now been eclipsed by many other deck builders that came later.

Still a wicked, strategic filler game, and looks good to boot.

UPDATE 01/02/14

Sam properly kicked my arse at this.
I’ve still got tons of respect for it as the daddy of Deck Building Games.  But it feels like most other DBGs have improved dramatically on the design since.  This feeling might be mitigated with expansions, but why bother doing that when you can build on better DBGs already instead?  And there are so many Dominion expansions I’m not sure I’d know, or care, where to start.

That said, it’s a good, fast playing game, with occasional minor confrontation thrown in with certain cards in the random set up, like Militias and Thieves.  Again I like the card art in this game, which I’m a sucker for, though the box art is bafflingly rubbish – seems like a missed opportunity there, but certainly didn’t hurt its sales figures!  I don’t really get the feeling of building my city, but then I don’t really get much thematic satisfaction from deck builders, because everything you build or develop quickly disappears into your big stack of cards.  I think Mage Knight (or even Pathfinder) handles this deck building implementation more ‘thematically’ by making it a set of spells, items and actions you have available, instead of buildings or people that occasionally pop up, depending on what hand you’re dealt.

I’m developing this deck building mechanic as one element for my horror game Blackmoor, where your deck is a set of emotions your hero has.  Playing emotions drives the actions available to you, and as you explore the game, your more placid emotions are gradually replaced with more extreme anxieties, fears and rages, as your hero starts to gradually lose it from the events he’s witnessing.  So, for example, if you see flitting shadows in a darkened room you might get an anxiety card, but if you see a massive rearing tentacled beastie you get a terror card.  An anxiety card might help you to run away from something, but a terror card is less likely to help you, it might even drive you to do something crazy to get rid of it, like murdering an ally or stranger.  And of course if you don’t get rid of that terror card, and it’s still in your deck come the endgame, well, then really bad things are going to happen to you...  Since deck-building decks are constantly in flux I think mechanically it fits nicely with how a person’s emotions are constantly in flux, whereas more fixed game elements, like items or people will stay out in play independently of the deck building aspect of the game.

Anyway, rambling aside, Dominion am good, but not as fun as the other DBGs.

(After 33 Plays) 10/12/16: Dominion is fantastic. This is one of the games I have played the most. This introduced me to one of my favorite genres in deckbuilders. I still believe it is the best deckbuilder as it is so simple. Other games try and add in too many other mechanics (some later Dominion expansions have tried to start this), but Dominion is just pure. I love how many kingdom cards there are. I cant imagine ever getting tired of this one with all the cards available for the game.

RATING: 9
I think of it as the granddaddy of the deck building games (much like Magic is to CCGs).  So many cards and combinations make this one a new experience every time it hits the table.  Expansions just make it better and more varied.  Has appeal for gamers and non-gamers alike.

The founding father of all deckbuilders. A study in mechanics above all, as the theme is essentially irrelevant and the player interaction minimal without some specific card sets (witch, etc.) Largely irrelevant at this point as many other titles have extirpated the mechanics and applied them to more sophisticated & thematically sound games. But I guess you can't get more pure deckbuilding than Dominion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
In this card game, one starts with a 10 card deck, consisting of seven copper cards and three 1VP cards. You always deal out five cards, perform actions, buy new cards, discard and draw five new cards. In the middle of the table are 10 different cards, with a quantity of 10, which you can buy. The game has 25 of these cards, and every game, 10 of these are in play. These cards are the heart of the game, which gives you bonuses in buying, getting more actions, etc. Also available for purchase are more copper, silver, gold,  1 VP cards, 3 VP cards and 6 VP cards. The game ends when the 6 VP cards are exhausted, or any other three stacks are depleted. 

This is a good card game with a lot of variety. There are many possibilities, different games, and they all clock in very fast.  It's also a lot of fun, though after repeated playings, it has lost a bit of the shine, though. I really enjoyed it initially, and liked the game design, but there needs to be a way to equalize player order.

This is a great "all in the box" card game. It's kind of what I wish M:tG was. The only downside is that I wish we could play with more cards in the middle. There are so many options available with the expansions. I love the game, but I wish I could make use of more card options in the center with each expansion.

RATING: 7
Deck building is interesting although not my favorite mechanism. Finding interesting combinations is rewarding and the game really turns on knowing when to start filling you deck with otherwise useless victory points hurting your engine. Variability seems good early on but gets predictable once one figures out the strong combos in the base game without expansions.

A mechanism is not a full game.
Watch Ricky Royal play the game solo on YouTube. The robot strategy he assigns to the dummy player cannot be beaten, which kills the game for me.

This is probably the best deck-building game ever.  For that matter, I think it is the original deck-building game.  Every time you play is possibly different than the last time depending on which cards you choose to use.  Buying expansions increases the possibilities.  This is a must-have addition to anyone who enjoys card games.

It is fun. It spawned a whole sub-type of game, which really makes the game speak for itself.

The only reason it is not rated higher: The birth of my shadowrun crossfire character, where I can level him up from game to game as opposed to starting over with dominion.

Rewards long-term strategic planning, leading to an end-game that feels personal.  I can understand the complaints about thin theme, as the relationship between card name and action, along with a limited random selection of them, means there's nothing cohesive going on.  It's a deck-builder, and that's about it.  For theme I'll go with Trains.

I have played Dominion several times and still have yet to see what the fuss is about. While I love the design, and think the endless deck and scenario possibilities are a great way to make a game that is playable over and over again, while playing it I have never felt engaged the way I feel with other games. I'm not entirely sure why that is, so unfortunately no constructive criticism to be found here. Apologies.

Dominion is one of the best card games on the market. It is one of the very rare games that accomplishes simplicity of gameplay yet has some deep strategy. Games are quick, teaching new players is easy as icons and texts are very intuitive. Simply, Dominion is a deck building game. Ten variable ‘kingdom’ cards are placed out on the table, of which players use treasure cards to buy them, in order to build a deck to most effectively reach the high end victory point cards. As those ten kingdom cards change each game, there is lots of replay value and based on the theme of the cards added the game can change quite dramatically (which is where the expansions come in and shine!). 

A very fun game, being a favourite for many. Easy to learn but hard to master!

Some post thoughts:
-Would be good to see some curse markers opposed to cards. Too many curse cards in the deck ruin the fun factor of the game and make it much longer than necessary. Thus I tend to avoid curse driven games, which limits card choices.
-Some treasure cards with reactions on them, i.e. bribe the Militia? Current reaction cards could be better / useful other than the reaction component. Once again, attack cards can be annoying when you have played 500+ games. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I dislike the shuffling or dryness. I think the replayability will slow down considerably around 20 or so games with the base game, and I think I dislike how little interaction there is without attack cards.

I do however like how the deckbuilding represents an investment over time in your kingdom, how balanced the game is and how many different strategies work. I wish it came as chits and with more variation of cards though.

Plays: 10+

Replayed after a long break and liked the speed, simplicity, huge variety with expansion cards and sifferent strategies and openness to beginners. Still despise shuffling though. Its a good game otherwise though.

I think if this game came with the best two or three expansions, Id love to buy it.

Played more times and all the expansions up to Dark Ages almost minus ine or two. The strength of the game is definitely the variety and purity of the game and its expansions.its very costly and time consuming to sleeve so you can shuffle more easily but enjoyabke. Plays pretty quick and no major issues either once you getpast replay. I think I may one day get the full set, maybe, depending on how my tastes evolve. Its still just good though and not truly great imo...

EDIT: Okay, I've played the app a lot with the various expansions and REALLY like the addictiveness and variety. I think it NEEDS expansions but with them, its probably a great game that has super high replaybility and variability. Its so pure but almost always plays within an hour while being a classic deckbuilder with lots of interesting decision points, despite the lack of player interaction/attention to others. The only issue is needing SO MANY expansions since the base game itself is only decent-good ish.

Brilliant game, played about 400-600 hundred games (at least 250 recorded, and about a quarter of them online). Game play becomes very luck dependend with 3 and 4 players. Best to play with 2 experienced ones.

Too slow for what it is - a fairly luck-driven card game. I do like the deck-building aspect, moreso than MtG - and I certainly appreciate that there's not hundreds of different cards with variable powers and possible combinations to learn and remember thus alleviating the thing I disliked with Magic that you needed to dedicate yourself immensly to the game if you at all wanted to compete. Dominion is a good game, and certainly a good gateway game - yet it falls short of a great card game - there's not enough control to be a great strategy game and not enough luck to be a great push your luck card game.

A solid game with high replayability, though I've replayed all the replayability out of it. When I first got this game, we would play 10ish games in a row at gaming nights and little else. Due to the game's modular nature as well as its deck-building mechanics, every game is truly different.

The game was unique enough at the time to spawn a whole genre of boardgames. Definitely a classic.

For me, Dominion is an okay game and I'll play it willingly as my girlfriend really enjoys it. I do find that I'm liking it less and less the more the expansions are added.

Wow, this turned out to be a wonderful game and my gaming group loved it.  Simple game mechanics with a whole bunch of strategy and depth.

However, as we started to mix things up a bit, it got pretty interesting and fun.

Card games and I don't often get along, and I think randomness is to blame. Card drafting games are still card games, but they at least offer probability manipulation as their core mechanic.

Approved.

The deck building game that started it all.  The base game has great components, nice artwork and a good instruction book.  The starting kingdom card suggestions work well to get games going.  There isn't a lot of player interaction in this game so there can be some downtime.  All in all an elegantly designed game that deserves its accolades.

I played this yesterday with 4 players, and it really puts Ascension (the only other deckbuilder I've played) to shame. 

Having to decide when to buy victory points cards, and determining what combination of cards you need in order to build an efficient engine of cards is really nice. I like that this game doesn't give you points for actions cards like Ascension does, it makes the decision between additional actions or victory points cards somewhat difficult.

I also like the fact that the action cards remain the same throughout the entire game, again, emphasizing the fact that you need to determine what cards are best for building a good engine.

When this game first came out, I read the articles written about it and thought "how can this game possibly be any fun?" Now, years and years later... and boatloads of deckbuilding games later, this game still gets played.

I will probably be playing this one for a long time.

I like this game as it has an almost therapeutic feel. I think it is best played with 3 players but works well with 2 or 4 as well.

I love analyzing the 10 sets of cards at the start of the game and then trying to see what combinations will be fun to use.

Your long term strategies always have to adapt if you are playing with good players as they will take advantage of the weaknesses in your deck.

This is one of the staples in my collection since I have gotten so many plays out of this and have successfully introduced it to so many people.

RATING: 7
I got a feel this game can be as addictive as Race for the Galaxy but with less variety.  It doesn't feel like any other game though, a slight comparison perhaps to some mechanics of A Game of Thrones CCG but overall it is in its own category.  Quick gameplay and the possibility of huge combos.  Very interesting mechanics, shame it only serves 2-4 people but for a game this fast that's not necessarily a bad thing.

Update 1:  The goal of the game is to make the most "broken" card combo, so the theme is irrelevant.  I much prefer other deckbuilders but to each their own.  However, Dominion is to be respected as the one that started the whole deckbuilding frenzy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I honestly can't decide what I think of this game.  Feels entirely too random and chaotic at times, as the exact same strategy will work one game and fail miserably the next, even with the same action cards in play.  Although I enjoy it, I'm never too sure how much I like it.  It's main strengths, in my opinion, are its lightness, it's ease to teach, and the speed in which it can be played.  Has more of a feel of strategy than actual strategy.

One of only three games in my collection that deserves the perfect '10'!

In one fell swoop, Dominion created a new genre of games and threw CCGs out the window. Impressive!

The game comes with 25 sets of cards, and you use 10 each time you play. The variation is basically endless, you'll never play the same game twice! From these 10 sets, you build you deck as you play, trying to score more Victory Points than the other players.
The cards might be a tad simplistic, but it is the base game after all. However, I don't think I've ever had this much fun with only the base game with any other game before!

Ok, I'm playing this one all the time, so:
Increased the score: 9 --> 10!

Very ADDICTIVE fast paced game.  Just got our copy tonight and already played 10 games.  Very easy to learn and tons of different strategies for winning. Fun game to experiment with different tactics.  With 25 different sets of Action/Attack cards and you only use 10 sets a game, this game has endless replayability.

While not as horribly tedious as Race for the Galaxy, it is still seems like the gaming version of short-stroking.

You sit there and fiddle with your little 'realm', while everyone else sits around and fiddles with theirs. Same kind of race-to-resources thing as RftG.

Not impressed, but I'd play it again...if I had to.

RATING: 5
While I will usually play Dominion if someone wants to, and I appreciate that it started the deck building genre, I just don't like it that much.

As a deckbuilder, it maintains the old problem that, in order to win, I have to glut my deck with useless cards which often means that my hands become LESS fun as the game progresses.

Further, I don't like that the cards seem like they should be thematic, but only loosely are.  On many turns, I can't figure out exactly what it is that I did (narratively speaking), and I normally feel like I can do this in even the driest of Euros.

Finally, I feel like in the majority of the games, we set out 10 piles of cards (in addition to the 3 coin types and 3 victory point types), but only about a third of those 10 card types are used each game as experienced players quickly zero in on the best strategy and engage it.

I was late to the Dominion scene and by then I'd played a myriad of other deck building games. Was I right to assume that I'd already seen everything Dominion had to offer? Yes and no.

I found Dominion to be a really stripped down version of a DBG ,(it was the first after all). What I didn't expect was how refreshingly quick and enjoyable this made play. The lack of frills made for streamlined mechanics and focused play despite its rather themeless nature.

Great deck-building game for 2-4 players.  Everyone starts with the same deck of 10 cards and as the rounds go you buy more cards for your deck until one of the end conditions is met.

You only use 10 cards per game and it comes with 25 so the combinations of different games is quite endless.

Best part of this games is its easy to teach and lasts 30-45 mins.

I am a sucker for Dominion. This is the first game after Settlers of Catan that truly grabbed me and made me feel like I should play every day. The deck building mechanic is elegant and fair, and many cards provide many exciting combinations. That said, the base set can wear out fairly quickly. There are many cards that I don't personally find interesting or useful (though I am sure some experts would disagree). Having Prosperity and Intrigue has really kept my interest strong. The only other gripe I have with the game is that there isn't a real theme here. 

Edit: Still love it! Isotropic really spoils me. When that goes down, it will effect my desire to play greatly. I hope the official app can be half as good as Isotropic.

"Reverse-Magic".

I've been recommending this game to parents whose children are interested in collectible card games but haven't actually gotten hooked on any yet: It fills the deck-construction ya-yas without forcing folks to spend billions of dollars just to keep up with the Joneses.

Also, it's crack for aspiring young game designers, as the "pick 10" rule triggers the creative spark for how games work.  I wouldn't be surprised if this game is cited by folks years from now as that game that got them to start designing.

The game has become a little more interesting now that I understand basic strategy.  It's the textbook definition of a light-weight, between-game filler and gets used as a stopgap between two game groups before the second major game of the evening happens.  Also, family.

I can't believe I'm saying this, because it goes against my principles, but it's also as true as the wheel: This game improves exponentially with expansions.  The alternatives force you out of comfortable strategies, and random draws ensure a fresh combo for you.  Yes, you'll get the inevitable "wha? really?" card in your mix.  Play anyway.  And yes, play with "attack card means at least one defense card".

I think I begin to understand the love this game gets.  Easy to learn, quick to play, expandable, lots of approaches with with to experiment, plays well with 2.  If you enjoyed putting together CCG decks, you'll probably like this.  If you like creating your own luck, you'll probably like this.

If you don't mind losing, there are virtually unlimited possibilities for strategic exploration.

It is obvious to me that the creators have thoroughly tested the card cost vs. return structures.  I would not be surprised to find there are multiple equally good strategies for each combination of cards used.

Why this is not a 10:
-> I enjoy variety in my gaming.
-> After a few plays, it starts to feel the same
-> This sure is a lot of work for the amount of game!

Fantastic, elegant design which popularized a genre.  Not without its problems.

The theme is bland, and there is too much shuffling.  It feels like the game should include something to organize the cards on the table at its MSRP and given the box size.

Beyond that, the base game is not well-balanced. Your engine is either going to be straight Laboratories OR Village/Festival + card draw, or you will simply lose.  In the absence of those cards being availabe it's hard to beat straight money plus a couple +card draws.  Haven't played with expansions yet except a little bit of Intrigue, I suspect the game improves substantially with more card variety so that the metagame isn't so limited.

It may sound like I'm ragging on the game, but despite all these problems I've played it dozens of times and I think the core gameplay mechanics are nearly perfect.  The choices are so clear-cut yet so meaningful; the randomness is enough to make every game different and keep one player from always winning, but the more skilled player will still win a significant majority of games.  It's easy to teach but has plenty of depth.  Setup can be customizable through card drafting or randomly different each game.

RATING: 8
Dominion is great in that it has great variability. Each game is about determining the best set of cards to use among what's provided. All the expansions give different flavors to the game. The base game is bare bones, just the core mechanics. Intrigue gives players choices to make with each card. Seaside introduces cards that stay around and affect future turns. Prosperity brings higher value money and cards into the mix, giving players the option of trying to max out scores, or cash out quickly and end the game before others have their high price engines running. Guilds brings coins into the game, which allow you to bank some of your money for future use. All of these expansions provides something unique to the base game, and the mixture of all of them gives every game a unique feeling. I really enjoy this game and have played it with all levels of players. The core mechanics are relatively easy and approachable, and once new players have them down it's not too difficult to bring in the expansions.

RATING: 9
I'm very impressed by the "deck building" mechanic of Dominion. The game feels very unique because of this and I like the CCG feeling of it. Trying to get working combos and therefore an edge againts other players. I really like how the deck evolves during the game. On the other hand the the way the game ends and purchasing of victory points feels "too simple" way to determine the winner. Especially because the players have hardly any interaction between them. 

The game isn't totally without interaction. Naturally you should follow how much others have invested in points and how close the game is to finish but there are only a few cards that enable any direct interaction between players. Normally this doesn't matter too much to me but in Dominion it felt almost too much of solitaire gaming. Perhaps because of this it can be annoing when you get couple of bad draws and others are luckier. Naturally you should try minimize the risk of this happening by being clever when buying cards.

I would've liked the cards more if at least those main things (actions, buyings, etc.) would have been iconized instead of text. They would've been easier to spot from the pool. When cards are in hand this doesn't matter at all. This is less of a problem once you know all the cards.

Anyway, Dominion is a good game for sure and because one game uses only a part of the cards there is plenty of replay value. Even if it is a bit of solitaire, at least it's a really good multiplayer solitaire!

Roughly played 300 games between 2010-2015. Varying numbers of players. Like it best with 2 or 3 players, and 4 is ok but takes a bit longer. Played it a few times with 6 but won't do that again, game drags then.

Like it best with at least one expansion mixed through.
Always use random selection and don't change any selected piles but play as is (as this forces you to think of new strategies).

Love that a game can last from anywhere between 10-40 minutes which means you can play and try many games on a single evening. Especially for trying out various combinations of cards it is great a game can be very quick. And even with the same kingdom each game can be completely different.

RATING: 9
The game of constant shuffling. Moves very quickly, though. Very addictive. Works for both gamers and laymen.

The card layout is not very good: Because the money cards have their value marked on the top left corner only, I find myself constantly turning my cards the right side up, in order to see how much money I have. For trashing purposes, the VP cards should also have values in their corners.

Too bad they chose to use these flimsy and narrow  cards. And the card backs are hideous, as is the box. The cards seem to be surprisingly durable anyway; After 60+ games, there are no marked cards, and all the cards look like they have seen pretty much the same amount of use.

One of the few CCG-like games that I'll actually play.  Yes, folks, it IS a CCG, just that instead of buying cards a pack at a time, you buy expansion sets where every player gets the same card mix as everyone else.  No "rares" or whatever here.  In my opinion, this is a much more reasonable way to market a CCG.

The game itself is well-balanced and encourages some speedy play, which is nice too. Overall, I'll probably keep buying expansions for a while too, at least until the sheer number of expansions crosses from reasonable to ridiculous.

It's one of those games that soon gets its hooks into you. With a plethora of cards to play with and a short playing time I can imagine saying "Just one more game" as you want to hone your strategy, but also explore new cards and combinations. Do I like it? For the most part, yes, however, I'm disappointed by the low level of interaction and I'm not sure the strategies are particularly deep. I do want to play some more so it's going to get some table time.

Update: It does get it hooks into you. There is more here that I first thought and although you spend a fair chunk of the game looking at your own hand you need to consider other peoples strategies. 

Beware - this game gets much better as you add more expansions. In fact I would say the base game is rather limited and gets stale quickly, but with two or preferably five or six expansions this is great. I'd rate it a 7 on it's own and 9 or 9.5 with all the expansions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

I'll play it given almost any opportunity, which is my definition of a "9" rating.  I do wish there were more interactive cards; I'm really looking forward to the expansion to see what it adds to the game.

RATING: 9
Dominion is a very concise adaptation of a collectable card game into a more family-friendly format. Between two and four players start with a little amount of money cards and victory point cards and have to use the money cards to slowly build a deck with action cards (that can allow them longer turns, bigger hands and better purchases), more victory point cards (to win, of course) and more money cards to keep the engine running. The game mechanics are very clean: each turn a player gets a hand of five cards and has to make the best use of it (they get more cards if the right action cards pop up). This means it's important to get a good draw at the right time (but... being able to control the quality and size of your own deck during the game, can you really call a bad draw bad luck?). Here a nice aspect of the game comes to the fore - victory point cards might bring you closer to winning, but they allow fewer options during a hand. Thus, good timing to buy the victory point cards is required.

Two issues arise when reading the rules: first, a setup (ten different sorts of cards out of twenty-five available) can be explored in a limited amount of plays; second, a strategy of buying only money cards and then buying the biggest victory point cards ("provinces") seems to be very hard to beat. These doubts vanish after a dozen of plays the latest: precisely the slight luck of the draw keeps games fresh, and even though some cards are definitely weaker than others varied strategies can be found even for one single setup (let alone the possible combinations of cards). Concerning the money strategy: relying only on money is not enough against tougher players. Without any actions in the pack hands can get trimmed without any defense or counterattack, so that buying provinces is far less easy. Two purchases in one turn or extra money (i.e. actions) always come handy, actually.

Semplice, veloce, un bel gioco!
Adatto a chi non ama regolamenti troppo complessi. Fondamentalmente è un gioco di carte (assurde le dimensioni enormi delle scatole), ma con profondità maggiore della norma. Interessante anche in partite a due giocatori; le meccaniche sono semplici e quindi un po' ripetitive, ma la possibilità di cambiare i mazzi con cui giocare lo rendono sempre diverso.

RATING: 9.5
My rating on Dominion is dickering back and forth, but I still don't see it as a genuine Top 10 game. The mechanics are nothing we haven't seen a dozen times before, the artwork is nothing special, and there's little to be gained in the 3-player or 4-player versions except a whole bunch more downtime. It's easy to spend more time on faffy admin tasks than actually playing the damn thing, too. Holds up well because the gameplay will take violently (and surprisingly) different directions depending on which kingdom cards you use. I still maintain that Treasure decks are under-rated, though.

Further Thoughts - if nothing else, the game is becoming horrendously addictive, even with the mediocre cards in Intrigue, but it still concerns me that the whole thing seems to be a case of 'Race For The Provinces'. Bad draws after a carefully-built deck are very demoralising, too. Downgraded from an 8 to a 7.

More Further Thoughts - my God, it's easy to clock up plays with this one. It's clear that the central mechanics and the random layout work tremendously well. And I don't even mind losing. But now there are groans whenever certain cards (Chapel, Festival, Gardens) hit the layout, because we know they are going to dominate the strategy in advance. Still a 7, but for different reasons.

[i]Logging Plays - Since buying Dark Ages, we have tended to stick to 2-3 boxes per game, for richer layouts and so as not to marginalise Alchemy cards, so a play of each box is noted.[/i]

Dominion is much simpler than Race, so it's easier to get sucked in. On the other hand, I think the dynamics of strategy go much deeper in Dominion because the timing of your transition to VP production is much more critical and much more difficult to get right.

Great two-player game with fast setup and quick play.  The base game comes with enough different decks to keep most people occupied for a long time, but buying all the expansions is almost too irresistible because the various combinations are just so much fun to experiment with.

Very nice deck building game. Really enjoy playing it, but just haven't done it in a while, because we used to play it A LOT when we got it. 
I also seem to be over deckbuilding for the sake of deckbuiling a little. 
I now tend to like more games, where deckbuilding is incorporated into the overall gameplay and it's not the only thing. 
It plays very fast though also compared to other deckbuilders so it's fun enough and doesn't outstay its welcome.

Every bit as good as the hype. A real hit with most players. Quick to teach, and much replay value.

I strongly prefer the four player version because it makes the "big money" much less likely. I find Big Money boring (although The Witch and Militia are hilarious to play against Big Money adherents).

Great game, with the expansion(s) it gets better. Phenomenal game with people who are quick.

RATING: 7.8
A great game for 2-3 players.  With 4 it gets a little prolonged.  Basic rules are very simple: play an action card, buy a new card.  The most important decisions appear to be what cards to buy and when to buy them.  Deciding which card to use as your action is usually straight forward.

Depending on the choice of Kingdom Cards, this game plays a little differently everytime.  There usually isn't a lot of direct interaction between players as each is doing their own thing.  However, you do have to keep your eye on the other players carefully to gauge how soon the game is going to end and whether you want it to end sooner or later.

I rate the game highly, but only if you are playing with at least one other set of Kingdom Cards.  The cards included in this set are just a little too plain.

Fun card "collecting" game where you try to buy cards and build a deck that is a good engine for buying points later in the game. Biased to previous players, some very unbalanced cards that dominate, and, depending on choice, limited player interaction. I feel like I have played every possible combination so the gameplay is not always innovative and players tend to lean towards cards they know well that work rather than interesting combinations. 25-60+ minutes

RATING: 8
The principle of the game to build your own optimal deck during the game where points, money and special cards are perfectly balanced is what makes this game so much fun. Even better is that you use only 1 special cards, where there are approximately 25 different cards available. This way, each game can be different since there are different combinations of cards in the game. It is easy to learn and fast to start playing. I played with different types of players and the game was a succes in every group I tried untill now.

Almost everyone I've introduced this game to has replied "Meh" or "Blech". The only people that will play this game with me are people that already own the game, so I really shouldn't even have my own copy.

Edit: I still don't own my own copy, but the people to whom I introduced this game at work really liked it.

RATING: 8.5
After one play with a mega-set (all the expansions).  We played with Cornucopia and something else.  I liked the game.  Not sure how much I would like to keep playing it.  It has an interesting mechanic.  I won a 4p game with 2 new (myself as one) and 2 experienced players.  I went the route of cycling my deck as fast as possible to get my big cards in play.  And eschewed getting many low value cards.

For the novice player BSW is not the best.  The interface is more intuitive than other games on BSW but without the card text always available games take a while.  No shuffling but miss the shuffling and the visual cues that get from a live in-person game.

Quite addictive.  Not sure how long it will last.

I think this is one I'll enjoy - and be appalling at. One of the reasons (aside from spiralling costs) I stopped playing MTG was because I just couldn't construct good decks - and thats exactly what this game is about. Buy the best cards (including more money) to generate income and as the game progesses buy victory point cards too. Very good stuff.

FIRST ENTRY 01/2010:
Indeed: This one was a good choice for 2009's Spiel des Jahres award. I'm so impressed by its speed, the innovative design, the replayability... I can hardly wait for the next sessions! 

Having known only few card games (besides traditional ones), and having had my difficulties with this kind of mechanism, I may add that I was quite a little bit sceptical about Dominion, but I'm glad I brought myself to trying it. The term may be overused on BGG, but this game is truely "elegant". It immediately found its way into my personal Top 10 games.

UPDATE 05/2010
Not as replayable as I thought. Money-buy strategy dominates in many games. There were complaints about the game being not interactive enough. I tend to agree. Dropped the rating by 2.

UPDATE 11/2010
Find it rather boring now, and even feel a little bit cheated by the poor implementation of the theme. Dropped by 1 again and decided to put it onto the for trade list.

[b]Dominion[/b] was traded away for Ticket to Ride (3/3/14).
Received in a trade for Innovation (Iello version) 1/21/14.

[i]Wow, I have been looking forward to trying this one and now that I have I am not impressed. I find it extremely dry and all about the mechanics. There is no theme at all, the cards simply state what the action is, no fluff or flavor at all. This game has made me appreciate Legendary and eminent domain even more. I am surprised at how much the lack of theme really bothers me with this game, but I am uninterested in playing again.

After a 2-player game of Dominion, I don't understand why the game is so highly rated. In our game there was little to none player interaction and the constant card shuffling got a little bit annoying over time. Although the players are able to develop and execute a strategy to win the play, they do so more in a solitaire-style, rather than direct competition. The outcome of the game and strategy is not known until the game is over and then again, it is a lot of card and victory point counting. Just average for me, sorry.

This is an awesome game.  Although it is listed as a Board Game, it's really a card game.  As a huge fan of MtG (until the late 90's when the rules got 'dumbed down'), Dominion has all the most attractive elements of Magic.
The concept of Deck Building and Deck Tuning are an integral part of the game.
From the very beginning (with only 10 cards) you are simultaneously building and playing your deck.  As with so many of my favorite games, the resources available to 'purchase' improvements always feel like not-quite-enough.
The game is well balanced and plays EXTREMELY well with any number of players.
You have numerous alternatives for initial setup and for strategies to play during the game.  Although if you try to switch your strategy too late in the game you will fall far behind.

I think Dominion is still a very good game. I think in some ways it has been surpassed by other deck builders but it still keeps a place in my collection because of its accessibility and variety. Also I've managed to get all of my Dominion cards into one box so it doesn't take up a lot of space. I did remove the base game cards because I was finding we almost always would replace them with expansion cards anyway.

RATING: 7
Dominion is just the sort of game to appeal to an obsessive-compulsive bean counter type like myself.  Even when playing with others, you are basically in your own little world. Working away to amass victory points through the carefully balanced collection of action cards and coin is challenging and absorbing.  So many decisions to be made, and in such a short amount of time!  I also love the way that playing the right combination of cards can trigger an avalanche of branching effects.  And I almost forgot to mention--the artwork on the cards is really beautiful!  For all these reasons this game, though stressful, is also strangely soothing.

RATING: 5
The rules are a bit bewildering at first (never quite sure with Rio Grande games whether it's the writing or the translation), but once I got going, the game does play fast and it's obvious that are innumerable paths to victory, given the sheer number and types of cards. Also, it seems to take longer to play than what I've read. 

I'm not sure what all the hub-bub is about this game. I played it solo and with my 10-year-old son, and neither of us felt the urge to keep on playing, as so many others have reported. I really wanted to like it, and he really gave it a shot, but we agreed we could both let it go, so I sold my copy. 

Also, the game seems pricey, given that it's all (of 500) cards, but the cards are high-quality and have beautiful artwork on them. 

Purchased late April 2009, swayed by all the hype, but ultimately puzzled why others are so excited about it. But, to each his or her own.

Awesome game! Dominion makes me think of a highly evolved version of To Court the King! But that's not all...it's quick to play, simple rules and easy to remember, grand replayability, and interesting strategic possibilities! Begin with a starting hand of 3 estates and 7 coppers! Build your Dominion by purchasing kingdom cards to improve your property! Try not to clog your hand of cards with victory points too early in the game...but...you need them to win! Create a balance of cards to help you achieve victory! So good! 

And now with the Intrigue and Seaside expansions replay ability is vastly increased. Select your own personal card combo, pick a random selection, or play one of the suggested starter card sets...it's all good! Some complain that you can create a combo that will not work, but so far that hasn't been the case for us! In one game, everyone was reduced to zero money in our hands, but it just created a new strategy for us all!

It's a clever system and I can see why people like it so much. I was somewhat afraid I'd think the same of it as race for the galaxy, namely that it lacked interaction so much that I wouldn't enjoy it. 

While there is relatively little interaction it doesn't bother me as much in Dominion. I'm not convinced there is nearly as much replayability as people seem to claim. I think it will pall on me relatively quickly.

Relatively easy game to learn.  Slowest part of the game is figuring out which cards do what if you don't play regularly.  Honestly, while I want to win, I have just as much fun trying out card combinations.  "What will happen if I purchase this card, and this card, and this card and play them all together....  Oh, that was cool!"

This is a rating subject to change--2 plays 2-player with my wife.

It's pretty fun.  We played the starter game and the Big Money suggested set-up.  They played very differently, but were both fun.  The game doesn't blow me away yet.  It also got repetitive the last 1/3 of the game both times, even though the 2nd game went much faster.  It seems like you've got most of the cards you're going to use and are just hoping you get fortunate combinations from your deck.

RATING: 7
This is great. Dominion is simple but deep, and easy to learn. It is good as a long filler (typically 20-35 mins - you can vary it by which cards you put in) or it can be played back to back 2,3, maybe 4 times as it is different every time (I am normally a person who will never play the same game twice back to back if I can help it). 

There is some luck, but not too much - if you draw bad cards now, it means you are going to draw good cards later. There is also a nice mix of strategy and tactics. Some cards work better with others, and the skill is in choosing which cards to put into your deck (strategy), but also in analysing which cards to execute once they are in hand (tactics), though the tactical decisions are often automatic. 

It helps to have a good sense of pacing as this is an economic/VP engine building game that can end before you are ready. Having a good idea of what you've bought and in what ratios is helpful, so it is vital to pay attention to what you are doing. The interaction level can vary too, according to the number of attack cards available and whether or not people are buying them. If they are, then you need to pay attention as it can affect your purchasing decisions.

Dominion is elegant, deep and concise - a meaty game that plays quickly (like Puerto Rico) whilst being simple to learn (like Ticket to Ride).

Well designed strategic game. There is luck, but much less than you think initially. Shuffling also is less boring than it appears to newbies. Stuff for gamers and nongamers.

Base game is more than enough for years of fun. They are expanding too quick. Intrigue is bad. But Seaside is great, and I'm enjoying base + Seaside a lot.

The father of all deckbuilding games - a good game but very dry and I am finding that I like the other games in this genre (Thunderstone, Ascension) more for that reason.  Also, the lack of any real need to interact with the other player beyond a few cards (spy, etc) makes the down time pretty boring. 

I felt it was improved with Intrigue, and again with Prosperity, but for right now it's solid but not overwhelmingly awesome for me.

This my Go-To game for anyone and everyone at any time! Have at least some 50+ plays on this Game too many to keep track. Gave this a 9 because it is enjoyable for a broad group of players. This Set is essential in that it has all the base connector cards. Introduce new players using 4 players or less with some experienced players to walk them through the turns and you will easily have a new board game convert. Maybe I will start keeping track soon....

50+ plays. It doesn’t come out as much these days because it’s time-consuming to setup and pack away compared to other games in its lightweight niche. But it does provide a sense of satisfaction re determining a theory at the start of game on what the best card combos might be in the given random setup, and then coming up with and executing a plan to see how it works in practice. The limited interaction can be appealing, especially when playing with loved ones, but it therefore has the consequent sandbox downsides as well. It has the bonus of being relatively family friendly on top of being attractive to gamers as an opener or closer, so it’s no surprise it’s been so successful. Especially when you can pick and choose expansions to tailor it to your group’s preferred style.

The classic deck builder.  Light and fun.  We have 100% success with it as a gateway game.  If the person likes games with regular playing cars, this is an easy transition.  Get the seaside and prosperity expansions first.  Those are must-haves.  More decks are better with this game.

I love Dominion. I rate the base set on its own a 7 because it's a bit simple; I view it as a good introduction to the game that brings a lot more to the table when it's mixed with expansions... this is where the game really shines. 
Prosperity, Seaside, Dark Ages and Adventures really bring Dominion to life. With these expansions Dominion is one of my favourite games and i'd have no problem giving it a 10.

Dominion is the first deck-building game and arguably the only pure one.  It is one of my favourites (if not THE favourite) game and keeps making it's way back into my suggested games to play even after playing it hundreds of times.

One of my favourite thing about Dominion is the simplicity of the setup and the fairness throughout the game.  From the very beginning, all players start with the same cards and have access to the same "market" until the end of the game.  Rarely someone is able to blame losing on "bad luck", given the size and how many times you reshuffle your deck.  A bad hand is almost bound to be followed by a better one unless another player's actions interfere with this probability.

At first, I was passionate about building engines and combos and became disenchanted by the fact that they're most often inefficient.  But in the end, it was a real eye-opener to start seeing this game, as with many other pool/deck building games, as one of probability management rather than engine building.  After all, you rarely know for sure what actions will be available next turn.

Beginners and abstraction inept gamers are often intimidated or amazed at the possibilities in front of them.  That's why, unlike many others out there, I highly recommend the base game.

The base game was designed to introduce gamers to the genre, the basic mechanics and flow of the game before new expansions add to that.  Like every expansion afterwards, it contains recommended setups for introducing players to different possible deck types, card types and strategic elements.

For example, Village (+1 Card, +2 Actions) is the first of many "Village" type cards opening the possibility for engine type decks (decks focused on playing multiple actions).

Witch (+2 Cards, each other player gains a curse) in a great introduction to the burden of curses.

Chapel (You may trash up to 4 cards from your hand) is another great introduction, and one of the most famous cards, for getting rid of unwanted cards that you start with; effectively thining down your deck.

Market (+1 Card, +1 Action, +1 Buy, +1$) introduces the power cantrip (+1 Card, +1 Action) cards can have; virtually having no negative effect on draw/usage probabilities of other cards.

Moat (+2 Cards, When another player plays an attack card, you may first reveal this from your hand and be unaffected by it) introduces players to reaction cards.

Even if you're an experienced gamer, quite confident you don't need such an introduction, I still recommend getting a copy.  Cards like Chapel, Festival, Moat, Throne Room, Laboratory and Market can be appreciated when they come out during a shuffle.

Don't miss out on the simpleness and endless replay value of this game.

RATING: 8.6
Nice deck building game that can be easy to learn and play. It's a lot of fun when u get to spend up your money and use up your card's special abilities. Very good when everyone is of the same level otherwise you can have some blowouts with more experienced plyrs vs lesser lights esp if they have the killer instinct (not much fun in that). Lots of different cards/abilities to mix up the games but mechanics stay very simple. Good game.

RATING: 8
I feel this is a better game when it is played with one of its expansions.  The base set was very very important for me to learn the deck-building mechanic. But soon, I got bored with the base set by itself. The expansions give life to the base, really increasing the combo potential factor, turning up strategies a few notches, and working on old or bringing in new features that don't complicate the game but rather give the game its true charm.

I love the renaissance feel which comes through the cards and the artwork.

RATING: 7
What I like:
- Classic deck management
- Pretty easy to learn and teach
- Replayability with a variety of cards
- You *must* pay attention to your opponents to do well

What I don't like:
- Attack cards, and endless chains in a turn
- Dated deck management compared to newer games
- I dislike all the expansions I have tried
- Shuffling

I didn't expect to like it at all, but my first game was a pleasant surprise. 

However, the set of available cards really shapes how much fun it is (for me). At its worst, it's pretty miserable. Here are my ratings with some combos:
- 3 Militia/No Moat
- 4 Militia/Moat
- 4 Witch/No Moat or Trashing
- 5 Witch/Moat or Trashing
- 5 Garden

I think the voted 2.4 weight is a bit high for the base game, since those cards are not too complex and you only have to understand 10 of them at a time. I would give it a 2.2, slightly lighter than San Juan.

Great game. By far simpler then I had anticipated. It's cool that there are so many different card types that can be combined and used to provide different strategies and a very long replayability. THe hype around the game though made it seem much more then it actually is. and the size of the box is definitely misleading, there is no need for such a box, but ok, I'll keep it.

RATING: 5
Bleh Dominion.  Depending on the card piles used, you're basically playing a deck building game by yourself then comparing your solitaire score at the end to see who won.  many cards are dramatically more desirable than others meaning that they dictate what the games strategy will be more so than how you react to changes in the game.  When players are playing hostile cards against each other, you're not likely to even have the option to add a defensive card to your deck, making the game devolve into a lopsided arms race.  Also, the early game draws can really screw you for the rest of the game.

Collectively, Dominion ranks as a 10. When Isotropic hosted it, I'd say it was an 11. Getting in a 2-player game in 5 - 10 minutes, if not less, was heavenly. Even when I was not playing the game in person, I would buy the cards whenever they came out -- in fact, many of the physical cards in my boxes have never been used. I bought them to support Dominion and because it felt right to do so -- buy in reality, play for free online. Alas, those days have vanished.

12/18/10 - I played a three player game and took my time familiarizing myself with the cards before starting. We played the "first game" setup and I was disappointed from the start. I prefer a little interaction and I got nothing from this game. I rated it a 5.

1/12/11 - I am giving this another go. I keep reading all the positive reviews, so I started playing it online. The game gives me the same sterile feeling I had originally. The cards I liked the best are the ones that influence your opponents cards (witch or militia) as it reminds me of my MtG days. I bumped the rating to a 6.

This is a game where you have to create your card deck and ensure to be as efficient as possible. You start with 5 cards (bad ones) and turn by turn add more money and better actions to your deck. You need to ensure every card is used to the best of its ability since the cards keep coming back to your hand. A great game of thought and watching what your opponents are doing. There is not a lot of direct interaction, but the flow is great and if you just ignore others, you may be in for a surprise. Great game, good at two also.

Finally got a chance to play this. Was decent and if it got cracked out every now and again I would not be adverse to a game but there's little appeal here for playing this game frequently. As a CCG aficionado games of Dominion's ilk appeal to me and appear far to infrequently. I like the deck construction aspect from a common and fixed pool. I think Scarab Lords is the only other game I'm familiar with that has this concept and they let people experience the best part of CCGs for far less money. The game has nowhere near the depth I could find in a game of NetRunner or Shadowfist, however, and I have little need for filler games. The upcoming Warhammer: Invasion and it's drafting system will take the part of Dominion's I enjoyed most and put in a system with some more meat on it (at least from the games I played at GenCon). Still, a decent game and I hope it's success heralds more games in this underrepresented genre.

For the first 10 games it was ok and funny, since it's a totally new concept for me, who has not been playing so much.

After that, you can quite easily get to the base strategies where money matters, of course there's the "fun and not so interactive element" of building your deck huge with combined action cards, but they dont lead much to winning the game, since it's the money that matters. This is of course for the first game, and Intrique has improved that a bit, but I still get the feeling of "multiplayer solitaire in single player mode"...

If you miss the interaction and total screwage between players, full strategies and tight battle against each other till the bitter end, I suggest you check out Evolution Earth: Cataclysm.

RATING: 8
Our favorite game. Most plays have been with 4. People complain about the game with 5 but we still like it, assuming that you don't get a wild kingdom that drags and takes forever. I particularly enjoy how larger player counts make certain cards more or less useful (pirate ship for example). My analysis of the expansions:

Intrigue: Excellent. Some fascinating cards and combos.

Seaside: Could be my favorite. I love the duration cards in this set much more than the ones in Adventures. Also contains some of my favorite attack and trashing cards.

Alchemy: Really dislike the potions. Have barely played with this one.

Prosperity: Truth be told, I dislike the platinum and colonies. On the other hand, I love the other new treasure cards and the cards that give the victory tokens. Grand Market may be one of my favorite cards.

Cornucopia: I suppose that I would consider this one good. I don't particularly like the tournament, but the cards that give more benefit for having a diverse deck are fun and often quite powerful.

Hinterlands: So many fun cards in this one. I love Fools' Gold, Tunnel, Trader, Ill Gotten Gains...maybe the only card I don't like is Oracle because it drags the game so much with more players.

Dark Ages: I need to play this one more. I didn't ease my group into it and they had a bad impression. Most of them like games with lots of easy money and powerful cards, not ones where they are scraping by or being forced to use oddball trashing or attacking strategies.

Guilds: Extremely fun. I quite enjoy the use of the coin tokens for extra one-shot money.

Adventures: My opinion is mixed on this one. The components are horrible, and I dislike the addition of all the different tokens and their associated cards. On the other hand, Events are one of my favorite additions thus far, and more duration cards are awesome!

Empires: Only played a few times, but I love Landmarks even more than Events. Castles are very cool but of questionable use in a 4+ player game. Brings back the victory tokens which I love. Still uncertain on debt and I don't really love the dual piles feature. There just doesn't seem to be any point to it.

2nd Edition: Haven't played with the new cards yet, but they look great! Most of the cards they replaced we never bought if they showed up in the kingdom.

2 players: There are better but my wife loves it so we still play frequently.
3 players: Ideal.
4 players: Great.
5 players: This is a controversial opinion, but I still like it at 5.
6 players: I'll do it but it becomes a but much.

What more is there to say about Dominion that hasn't already been said?  It's the foundation upon which all other "deckbuilding" games (I don't like calling them that, but I digress) have been built, and I honestly believe it hasn't been surpassed.  Others are more thematic, or more "exciting", but none have the same delicate balance between strategy and tactics that Dominion sports.

I really enjoy this game, but I've now reached a point that I tend to end up playing against 2 sets of people: those that own lots of sets and play the game a LOT, I tend to get slaughtered by these people. Then I'll try and introduce it to people who haven't played and they seem to struggle with the concept and the amount of writing on the myriad of different cards and they then tend to shy away from it.

Well, this is my most played game ever.  I really like the variability, and the feeling at the start of each game when you look over the ten cards and try to work out what your strategy is going to be this time.  I don't think this is the best game ever, but its variability, short playing time and scalability between two and four players will keep me interested for a long time.  I really would find it hard to turn down a game.

Great game. Not the most strategic game as you are always at the whim of shuffle luck, but is fun, fast, and easy to learn. The replay-ability is great as you can play with a different set of cards each time and some cards get a whole lot better when certain other cards are in the mix. Biggest draw back is that it only plays four without the an large expansion.

RATING: 9
This was my favorite game for several years.  I was active on Isotropic while that was still going.  It's fallen for me just a bit because I haven't taught someone the game well enough to be super-competitive with me in my current game group.  To be fair, I haven't played a lot of the other deck builders out there, but I love the puzzle nature of looking at the ten kingdom cards and figuring out how to optimize my hand.  Add the ever shifting tactics as you watch what your opponent is doing and it hits a lot of the right buttons for me.  I like the level of interaction as well.  You can do your own thing, but you have to account for the other player otherwise you'll be left in the lurch at the end.

This game is very unique, I haven't played anything like it before.  It's very much a multiplayer solitaire affair (even with the "interactive" cards), and it often seems like for any given price, there's one card you'd want to buy to the exclusion of all the other choices.  Great as a light filler, but I'm not sure that there's much depth here.  Oh, and there is a crazy amount of shuffling in this game.

Played out the base set pretty quickly. Game gets better with expansions, particularly Seaside, which seems to change the game the most. 9-21-12 Now have many many plays, and isotropic games. Intrigue is excellent, everyone likes Seaside orange cards, Prosperity is great too. Added Cornucopia, it will hopefully help my play style (lots of action cards of different types).

This game really benefits from multiple plays. It starts out as you always trying to get the most money and winning that way [aka Big Money Strategy]. But as you play, learning how the action cards interact and how to manipulate your deck takes precedence. You can win essentially every time over new players playing that way. The base game gets stale after a while, but adding in even one or two expansions brings this game up to a 10.

Includes Black Market, Envoy, Governor, Prince, Stash and Walled Village Promos. I also have the upgrade pack which brings it up to 2nd edition. Removed the different cards.

My favorite deck-building game. Lots of combinations, very quick, though the base game misses on one point: after you identify the killing combo, you just have to execute it on auto-pilot. Apart from a few "military" cards, the game is deduced to multiplayer solitare, for me.

I'm not all that impressed at the moment, so I rate it as 8. Maybe my slightly negative impressions are due to my love for Race for the Galaxy...that is something we will see in the future after some more games under my belt.

It's not bad or anything...Race for the Galaxy is just better and fills nicely my "fast card game" slot. Somehow Dominion feels like an abstract card game with a paste on theme, whereas Race for the Galaxy does not (for reasons unknown).

The more I try new deckbuilders, the more I respect Dominion. Not only it was the first, but also the one that really explored this system.

The more I play Dominion, the less I like it. You figure out the ideal cards at the beggining, then play half an hour of easy choices. Its so repetitive it just makes me feel like a robot!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I love this game, it's fast, easy to learn, and really fun. The number of cards make each game new and you have to have different strategies for each time you play.
The deck-building mechanic is perfect, and in my group anyone can win.
I recommend that you buy sleeves to this game, you'll shuffle the cards a lot.

The game have two downsides though.
Depending on what cards you play with, there can be times where there is no interaction at all. Player A has his turn, then it's B, then it's C and then it's D. Whatever anyone did it had NO impact on someone else.
The other thing is that I find it hard to introduce this to new players, even if I want to. The reason is that someone who has played this before will kick the newbie's ass everytime, unless you play nice of course. So "casuals" (if you can call them that) might not like the game because of that.

I can not say enough about this game. For me personally, this is one of the greatest games I've ever played, and I've never introduced it to someone who didn't love it as well. This game has so many expansions, which add a lot of new cards and guarantee you will NEVER play the same game twice. There's multiple strategies you'll be able to do depending on which cards are in play, turns begin to go by really quick when you play with people who know how to play the game, and you can use cards that attack other players, or choose to take them out and play a game where you're just trying to earn more points than your opponents. This is my favorite card game and possibly my favorite game of all time, I can't recommend it enough.

What a cool idea for a game! It's a card game where you build your deck at the same time that you play it. 

In the early game you need money and cards that will allow you to make more actions and buy more stuff. In the end game you're trying to get rid of those cards and buy the ones that are worth points. Somewhere in the middle you have to make the shift from money to points.

It's quick, addictive and the deck building as you go mechanic really works well. It's also very suitable for online, because of all the shuffling of the decks. 

It's not thematic and doesn't score many points in the player interaction department but that's fine with me. 

After one's familiar with the mechanics and the cards, playing dominion is like driving a car: you do it without thinking and while chatting with the other players. Not thet it's bad, but it isn't a challenge, an immersive experience or a big mental exercise. It's just something pleasant and harmless to do when you need to kill some time.

Perfect for BSW!

 My wife is indifferent to Dominion and other deck building games, but I seem to love them for some reason.

I really enjoy the combos, variety, and euro feel to this game. Trying to build that optimal victory point engine, and doing it better than your opponent with the available resources, is something I enjoy. Of course some people are going to hate that. However Dominion seems to do it in a way that manages to hold appeal for most people. 

The balance in Dominion is such that even new players can do well. Experienced players (especially with the expansions) will win more often than not.

Interaction is low, but that changes with the expansions.

edit: Play with all the expansions with intelligent randomizing. Still greatly enjoy this game. It's a classic family game. Moved Dominion up to a 10. Many plays and many more to go.

8: So far so good. Nice and fun game. You can scale the level of interaction from it being close to solitaire to something somewhat similar to MtG. I can see the game getting boring after a few dozen plays, though, when all the options have been explored. Hopefully the expansions can spice it up. I'm kinda wishing there was something extra to make it more like MtG, but without the annoying money spending.

Big fan of Dominion - this was my true "gateway game." It's so simple to learn, and so adaptable. Thanks, Dice Tower.

I've played it a lot, but not enough to figure out how to use Chancellor. Even the Androminion app makes for a nice puzzle. 

A lot of complaints from pundits about this game have been that a) they played it too many times, b) other people in their gaming groups would rather play Dominion than whatever new game introduced by the podcaster, c) doubts about whether the next expansion can add as much to the game as the previous six, or d) it plays too much like multiplayer solitaire. The solitaire complaint is poor logic (the level of interaction depends on the cards that show up, with games of less interaction turning out to be very fast plays), and the other three seem to be advertisements for Dominion rather than valid criticisms. Nonetheless, a lot of these criticisms have been rather useful when I've been considering which expansions to look into. 
 
There's plenty of ways to balance the game with kids or beginners, by letting them tell you what to buy the first turn or two. That being said, I'd put it at a "medium" weight - one more than cribbage and poker, for me - due to the variety of situations and strategies contained within the base game.

As for the expansions, Prosperity has been great, and my experience with the others would seem to put Seaside and Hinterlands in a presumptive "to get" category, Cornucopia and Alchemy in the "pass" category (to say nothing for the promo cards), and Intrigue somewhere in between.

So simple yet innovative idea! Game lenght is precisely correct. Half an hour is short as a period of time but inside the game that time offers an rich experience with lots of options. 
I've really enjoyed every moment in my games and look eagerly forward to play some more.

A brilliand concept. Add-ons are easy to include and the games vary. There is a different strategy every time a new game is played. The only downside to me is that the box is way too large for the game. Well, I just hope that it means A LOT OF new expansions coming.

To summarize: totally awesome!

RATING: 7
So far I've enjoyed this game a lot, but it's starting to feel very repetitive. Even with the variation in cards, it seems that running for gold as fast as possible is very often the best strategy. Given that one of the game's main virtues is its fast pace, it's unfortunate that all the player interaction in the game has the essential effect of slowing the game down. Still, I like how easy the game is to teach, and really like the novel game mechanic. I'm looking forward to the expansions to this game and to the next step from here.

Update: To my surprise, this recently proved to be a fantastic family game. My siblings, mom, and 8 year old nephew all loved it and were able to play well. 

Update 2: You know what, I'm starting to enjoy this one more again. Interesting.

It's fast paced and different enough. A fun filler. Rather addictive as several others already experienced. But I wasn't blown away by it. The theme and cards are bland and after having seen the alternative fan made chit based design one wonders why oh why the game wasn't designed like this in the first place.

*update* 

This is the perfect "*shrug* okay"-game: I'll play it and get some enjoyment out of it if it's suggested, but it doesn't really grab me.

My current favourite. The mechanic is so unusual and interesting, it is short and scales well from 2 players. Very enjoyable game, and the one I'm always trying to bring to the table.
Upgraded from 9.5 to 10 2013. Still my favourite, with the addition of a couple of expansions. A few recent plays with newbies using just the base set reminded me that it really needs more than the 25 base action cards before it hits that magic stage where every game feels unique.

played a few times on BSW as well, I get what the hype is all about... 

We usually play two games in a row, using the blue bordered cards to randomly select 2 groups of 10 cards, which makes for nice variation. 

This has become one of our go to gateway games. The only people that didn't like it, wouldn't play because they saw the box and said it looked like a war game.

Dominion used to dominate our games nights but expansionitis and burnout have caused it's popularity to wane, for me at least. Still enjoy playing from time to time but no longer the main event it once was.

I think base game + Intrigue was the best mix, all the added stuff from Seaside & Prosperity mostly just bog it down.

We've only begun to scratch the surface of the deck combinations possible on this game.  This has all the benefits of deck-building games, without the misery of requiring real-world collecting.  The built-in limitations on the number of card-types per game are an ideal way to focus the game on a few strategies at a time.  There are a lot of great card-interactions to be explored, and each set of 10 action cards makes each game so different.

My SO's other favorite game, and she's quite good at it. Overwhelmed by the quantity of expansions, I only have the base game and it's 2nd edition update pack and the intrigue 1st edition.

It is a really fun, quick game/race of finding out a strategy quicker than the other players in order to get VPs first. Elegant, well balanced, replayabilty is really high since there's a lot of different combinations of cards. Strategies will vary from one game to the other.

Long story short my brother and sister-in-law stopped playing with us and I read too much strategy guides and that made it not fun to play vs my fiancee 2-player. After a long hiatus I've bitten the bullet and sold it for $100 to a fellow BGG geek.

RATING: 8
The 8.0 rating is for Base Dominion, not for any expansions or alterations.

I really like the base set and don't enjoy playing with attack cards. I tried expansions but am not sure that the game has sufficient structure to merit turning it into a heavier game. 

The fun of the game is that it's an engine-building race, and the more "extra-move" cards you get, the more extended and crazy your moves become, but if you focus on only powers & extra-move cards, you never get enough money to do anything substantial, so you have to balance money and extra-moves acquisition to get your engine revving to critical power before your opponent so you can acquire more of the highest-point cards.

I think it would behoove the publisher to publish a list of tested game decks, because some combinations play better than others and some combinations produce slow lumpy games that struggle to build momentum. 

At its best, Dominion is fast and almost addictive. At its worst, it's a weird slog to the finish. Almost any combination of the original base-set that goes light on attack cards or avoids them entirely leads to a rockin'good time. But blending in expansions is a special kind of alchemy. I suppose if a person were really into Dominion, that the creative process of creating fun balanced game scenarios would be a rewarding part of the game. But for the casual Dominion player, guidance in game construction from expansions is almost mandatory if you don't want to have a lot of "dud" games that leave you trying to remember which cards don't fit well together.

Classic game. Quick to play with a ton of options. Unfortunately, I seem to have a tendancy to put out Kingdom cards that don't combo well together. When that happens the game can be a boring slog.

[after 4 plays]: So far, the immediate response to finishing a game of Dominion is, "let's go again." I've only played two player so far and that has been a good experience. I'm looking forward to finding out how deep a game this may actually be. Definitely worth trying.
[after 20+ plays]: There is still lots of life left in this game for me. I'm looking forward to trying a campaign style game (see variants) to get through all the cards in one evening. Even using the same set-up there always seems to be another way to go for the win. I've also played up to five players and the game scales well but also changes so there are new possibilities opening up with different numbers of players. Great game.
[after 200+ plays and six expansions] Still lots of life in this game. I prefer it with two or three players but will play it with four. I would no longer really consider it with five.

It's a likeable, quick card game with an interesting mechanic of upgrading and refining your hand.

RATING: 8
A nice easy game to learn and get into. Accessible and yet sufficiently strategic to keep more serious players engaged. Extremely customizable set up allows to to play again and again with different strategies.
The game is essentially knowing when to "change gear" between acquiring more money, turn cards and the final victory point cards. Timing, counting the card odds in your deck and a good dose of luck are the essence of the game. I have a feeling that luck is the only drawback of this game, since games tend to finish with 1-2 victory points difference at the end despite different start off strategies.

I really think this is the one game I have that can be enjoyed by newcomers and experts alike.

A very neat little game lots of tricky interactions going on and lots of thought for the 20 minute playing tme.  As a game I really like this one as it scratches the old MtG itch without costing me the eart at the same time.  
So why only a 7?  Simply the quality of the cardstock, black borders and the daft sizing means that you have very easily damaged cards (especially if your friends can only manager a cack-handed overhand shuffle) that cannot be protected in a standard deck sleeve. Give me a 2nd edition with standard MtG sized cards or a white bordered linen finish and this is a straight 9, as I would certainly never refuse a game. 
BSW ftw! :)

In the card game Dominion, players try to acquire wealth, land, influence, and power in order to turn their modest kingdom into a fabulous dominion. Players spend the entire game building their own deck of action cards, treasure cards, and victory cards. Action cards provide a variety of bonuses such as extra actions, extra treasure, drawing more cards, and attacks against other players (although the interaction with other players is minimal). Treasure cards allow you to buy additional cards for your deck, and victory cards give you the points you need to win the game.

The rules are quite easy; each turn, you play a card, buy a card, and then draw a new hand. The strategy of the game is what you decide to add to your deck. You only have five cards in your hand each turn (usually), so you need to manage the balance between the three types of cards. Too many of any one kind can slow you down. Dominion contains 25 types of action cards, but you only use 10 of them each game. The varying combinations of action cards provide a slightly different playing experience each time.

With simple rules and mechanics, fast play, a variable supply of cards, and a reasonable balance of strategy and luck of the draw, it's easy to see why this game has been so popular. Dominion is designed for two to four players ages 8 and up. Several expansions are available to add more card variety, more choices, and more strategy. The Intrigue expansion also provides cards for more players to join in the fun. 

I was introduced to this game after a trip to the mall up north and noticed one of those board game stores in the corner by the food court.  One of the guys in there told me they were about to start a game of Dominion and that I should join.  Well I joined and must say that I really enjoyed the game.  I ended up buying it from the store and took it home and my wife loves it!

An addictive, fast-paced, deck-building game. You and your opponent start with a deck composed of some low-value money and low-value VP cards. From this humble begginings you have to amass as much VP cards as you can. In order to do, both action cards and money cards are essential.

In fact, the touch of genius in this game is that while getting more VP cards than your opponents is  the goal of the game, VP cards are actually dead weight *during* the game. You are only allowed to have 5 cards in your hand during most of the game, meaning VP cards take up precious space - as they do nothing apart from scoring at the end of the game. So you'll have to carefully balance the composition of your deck.

As in all card games, there's a bit of luck involved. Yet, it can be tamed with a well-constructed deck. 

The theme feels a bit pasted on, but the mechanics are as simple as they are solid - and fun. A highly recommended game.

Still in the "always want to play it" stage. I've been playing purely random card assortments for a bit and each combination requires a rethink of strategy to fit the mix. Excellent game. Although I will pick up expansions, I think that the current set will have a lot of replay value for quite a while.

There is a lot to this game.  The deck building from the ground up is fun, but there's definitely a learning curve to be concerned with.  After a while, there become some strategies that just are better than others, but it's still fun to have to decide what to do on clutch turns early and late in the game.  Luck keeps it replayable, but skill will define the better player.

Dominion has shown that eurogames still have future.

After ~50 games upgraded to 9.

9 is for whole Dominion system. I would rate this set alone 8.

RATING: 8
Quite a unique card game, the way you gradually choose & acquire cards to add to your deck. Plenty of scope for trying different strategies, especially given the subset of 10 card types out of 25 used in any given game.

Not too demanding on the brain. There's a fair amount of luck in the way the cards cycle into your hand, and many actual plays are obvious, but the card drafting is where the interest and replayability lies.

The card actions and variety may become stale with time - I guess this is where the exansions will come in, but if they are priced and sized similarly to the base game (and it sounds like this is to be the case) then I'm not sure they will be worth the expense or storage space.

Plays well with 2 players.

Theme is fairly irrelevant.

Card quality is fine. Sleeving is tempting especially given black borders, but probably not worthwhile given the number of cards. The box is WAY TOO BIG, even for 500 cards!

So fun! I'm so glad I came across this game. It combines my love for CCG and board game in one with the unique idea of deck building. I can't wait to get all the expansions, and it's something easy to show others that they all love too.

RATING: 9.75
An innovative (and now much-copied) mechanism of play, deck-building just seemed boring when I first read about it.  Thankfully a friend got a copy and I gave it a shot.  Greatly enjoy this game.  I've played several other "better" deck builders that have come along since then and haven't liked them nearly as much.

Played base Dominion and found it very dull and boring. Understand how the system can get better with a different expansion of cards, but really lacks player interaction and feels like you are playing a game of solitaire.

A very fun, quick game.  Lots of replayability as each different set of Kingdom cards leads to different strategies.  A lot of fun to try out different combinations to see if they work.  Very addictive.

RATING: 8.3
First play: I'm really not struck on this, but I'm eager to play more games to see if it will improve.

Ok, we've now played it much more with some expansions too.  It is much better than I first thought.  However, with a random setup it often seems more like a puzzle game, where the there is an optimal 'solution' with the cards available and the winner being the player who can get closest to that.  It is also quite unforgiving if your strategy isn't working compared to your fellow players.

Do you have enough to buy a provence? No, then buy gold.

I just wish money wasn't so powerful compared to the other cards. To be fair I've never bothered with any of the expansions. 

I like every other deck builder better than this. 

That said, there's so much of it, I would consider it if I could only play one game, because there must be replayability.

Despite being regarded as the best and original deck builder, there are just more interesting games out. Having played Dominion after a lot of the newer deckbuilders, it felt a bit basic. I imagine the multiple expansions take care of this, but still. I don't think I would frequently turn a game down, but I also don't feel the need to add it to my collection. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This one is very easy to teach and understand so you start playing right away. There are definitely deckbuilders with a richer theme but I would say this is tops for introducing some one to deckbuilding and a great choice if you just want to start and don't want to spend a lot of time going over rules.

RATING: 8
Medium complexity, deck building card game, expansions do add more complexity & options.  I prefer "Ascension" as being more compact, easier to set up & pack up, & having more options.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Update: No, recent play of expansions has dimished the desire to play this game, player turns expand and become too confusing to maintain my interest.

For card counters, especially for the interesting aspect of trying to force a desired card into your hand, this is Nirvana, as there are cards that allow you to dig deeper as well as the means to purchase more of the desired cards. I like this aspect but Dominion fails to push me to the dizzy heights, mainly due to experience that as the game progresses player turns can expand beyond the 1 action and 1 buy at face value, so it can be a little heady to follow and monitor, but this feeling is from one play only. But would I play it again? Maybe, as I like to exercise the skill of tightening the deck contents. However the real problem is I would need to follow my opponent(s) collection of vps (in order to get a sense of a tense race) and this would be too much.

Great game of deck building. It's about the variety of play when the collection is large for me. Some cards can dominate a play, but if the set is large, that's one of the variety for how a game may play out. Fun for real gamers, but a pretty decent game for entry level gamers too.

[i]Nov. 2012 : I upgraded my rating from 1 to 2.[/i]

The [b]Tetris[/b] of card gaming : very mechanical, addictive, but void of any substance and human interaction. And therefore, a complete waste of time.

This game is dull and does not even work properly. You’re supposed to build the most efficient deck from a set of ten actions cards. Good concept, but it fails in execution. Because of randomness, you are never certain to win even if you find the best theoretical deck (in fact you could be beaten by the most basic heavy money deck). My opinion is that an abstract game for 2 players where the most basic strategy can beat the statistically most efficient is simply broken.

Designer's response for the huge impact of the luck of the draw : [q]http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/2974072#2974072
“The game has a lot of luck; turn order isn't even the biggest dollop of it. And the amount of luck it has is a good amount; I don't know anyone who likes to play games where the best player always wins. Well except when they're that player”[/q]
So, a lot of luck is a good amount of luck. His game is a fest of luck and he mocks the one billion players of Xiang Qi (the chinese chess) and the players of Go who are almost as many.

Dominion is a awesome card game. I love the interesting concept about how you create your own deck and forces you to not get mad at your deck because you are the one creating it. The combinations of cards that can be made while playing this game is practically endless in variety and makes the atmosphere exciting and intense as all the players try to reach their goal: The Provinces. The only critic that I have with this game is that sometimes with a mass amount of players, cards become short when trying to compile your deck. Other than that, (and on a personal note) my family and I are in love with this game, with me fighting against my mother for first place, while my father is lingering behind in the background. My sister is a completely different matter, with her hoarding all the Moats in order to be "protected from all the evil cards", even though she still gets caught out.Very good game.

Kártya alapú birodalomépítős játék, ami méltán nyerte el 2009-ben az Év játéka díjat Németországban.
10 lappal indulunk (7 db. 1 érmés kártya, és 3 db. Győzelmi pontot érő kártya), amiből keverés után öt lapból akciózunk és vásárolunk. Amiket "elhasználtunk", azt a saját dobópaklinkra helyezzük. Ha elfogy a húzópakli, akkor megkeverjük a dobópaklit, majd "újrahasznosítjuk", mint húzópakli. Ez így megy a végtelenségig, akarom mondani a játék végéig.
Hogy miből vásárolhatunk? A játék elején véletlenszerűen kiválasztunk 10 félét az akciókártyák közül, így a játék újrajátszhatósága hatalmas.
Szerintem egy remek játék, mindenkinek csak ajánlani tudom!
A szabály sem bonyolult, de ha mégse értené az új játékos, akkor az első kör után már biztos gyorsan fog pörögni a lap.

Basically a game about shuffling cards. I don't understand the hype about it. Own all the expansions and the game is not better with them - just more colorful.

Good game, although I didn't understand it at the beginning. Now it attracts me a bit more. Interesting mechanics, but Big Money + 1 or 2 cards wins with most of the setups. Becomes repetitive quickly! People say that adding expansion improves it, but I have not had a chance to try ...

RATING: 7
This game met my expectations, which means it is average. There was definitely a start player advantage as in one game the start player went first and last, and won by 3 points (and bought a 6pt card as his last action). Maybe I wasn't getting the card combinations but it did seem like a case where the player who got the luckiest draws won with advantage going to the start player. 

It was fun trying to work out card combos and figuring out how to improve the content of one's deck. And for a short game, a fun filler, Dominion fills the niche well. I'm not sure why it is like #27 on BGG though.

Edit: Initial reaction--this game is average. Revised impression--this game is neat. Current impression--this game sucks. There's just not enough here and there are too many setups with only one real viable strategy. The vast majority of play time is dedicated to non-decisions and shuffling. Good for passing the time with though, if Race for the Galaxy is not within reach.

Yet another game with poorly written instructions. I had to learn from utube videos. When I could play the game I went back and re-read the instructions and.... boy are they poorly written, not in the sense that they are wrong, but several things seem to have been missed.

Fun fast paces game that's a little different every time.  I've gotten hours and hours of fun from it and I have only played the base game but could see it getting stale if I played it much more.

Depending on the board sometimes there is no player interaction at all so it is like everyone is playing a one player game at the same time

I like the idea of building a deck of cards that represents your kingdom. Beyond that, it's another 'victory point engine'. Maybe I just need a couple more games to get into it. Maybe.

RATING: 9
This game plays fast, is pretty easy to learn, has good artwork, has some interesting deck-building strategy, but most importantly, it has a ton of diversity. It's quick enough that it's easy to play a series of games, and they can play very differently. I played one game that was treasure poor, and one that was overflowing with treasure. You can have a lot of cut-throat interaction, or almost none at all. Overall it's a blast to play. The box is a bit big, but the insert does a good job of holding all the cards in seperate groups, which makes setting up a lot easier.

A pretty fun deck-building game that feels a bit incomplete. There is some interesting engine-building and it is pretty easy to jump into and grasp everything that is going on, but there is not much else to the game to support the engine-building. It feels like you just decide on a large-scale strategy when you first look over the card set, and then you often don't have many interesting decisions to make when you play the individual hands. You can play most of the game on auto-pilot, which I don't really like.

Dominion almost feels like a really cleanly built tech demo more than a full game. It's a fascinating mechanic that has been incorporated into many other games since, but some of those later games have done it better. In particular, Trains is very similar to Dominion, but the addition of the board and more player interaction means that I would always rather play Trains.

Initially quite addictive due to novel game mechanics. After a few plays one finds the enjoyment is dependent on the other players playing at the same pace - which is rarely the case as some play much more than me and others much less. So, I've broken the addiction and it's now shelfware.

Dominion. I succumbed to the hype and bought it one day, and, being a fan of card games, I was expecting an excellent game. Was it excellent? Nah. Don't get me wrong, it's a good game and it's well designed, but it lacks a lot of the elements that make gaming fun for me, and has a lot of the elements that make gaming dull. For example, you spend most of the game shuffling cards and watching other people take their turns, and there is very little player interaction to speak of. On the plus side, it (usually) plays quickly and there are a lot of interesting card combos that can be used, and I like the idea of building your own little deck from scratch. But the novelty wears off after a while and you spend most of your turns making sure you play the cards you just picked up in the right order... the only real decision making comes from deciding which cards you want to buy. And that's it really. A couple of my friends really enjoy the game though, so I'm quite happy to play it with them. But there are a lot of other games out there I'd much rather spend my time playing.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Grossly over-rated. And if you must buy expansions to 'improve' the game... then down-rated for crass marketing.

I'm not much of a fan of card combination/optimization games. It is fast and the rules easy to understand. The question is: is it worth the thought/study needed to play well? And will study actually result in a strategy that isn't mostly dominated by the card draws? And will that final strategy just be Big Money with 1 or 2 Action card buys?

There are some card deals are dull and frequently individual cards have no value. It also looks like a Deck-Thinning/Money/Province strategy could work in many cases which make the majority of the deal unused. This essentially breaks the game.

A 5 rating is GENEROUS because of the above with the POSSIBILITY that some initial deals aren't so broken. I think we are done with this game. (If buying ONLY Ag then Au then Duchy/Provinces works then this is a solid 1. With that in mind I'll take and average.. so a 3!)

Der Deckbuilder schlechthin in seiner klaren und auf den Mechanismus reduzierten Art ist einer der großen Klassiker. Ein anderes Set der Karten ergibt ein anderes Spielgefühl und erfordernd andere Entscheidungen - was will man mehr an Variabilität. Das abstrakte Optimieren eines Kartendecks erfordert ein gewisses Abstraktionsvermögen, stellt aber auch immer wieder eine spielerische Herausforderung dar.

Very good game of skill.  It is addictive and dynamic - you need to change your card buying decisions as the game progresses.

Variable playing time dependant on the Kingdom card mix and whether other players are familiar with the game, but usually quite fast.

Recommend that card sleeves are used because of the high level of card shuffling.  Also note that you only need either the original Dominion or the follow-on Dominion: Intrigue as the base game.  All expansions work with either base game.

Played a 4-player game where the winner only had 11 points, I had 6 VP and the others had 4 VP and 1 VP - this game finished with all Curses, Witches and Villages in play.

Meh,
A low interaction acquire cards game. 
Not a bad game but not that interesting either. You build your efficiency engine, to get additional draws and money to be able to purchase the more valuable 
So your play is figure out what card to purchase works best given the money you have on this round. pick it, draw the next set of cards - rinse, repeat. Run out of cards shuffle new draw deck, rinse, repeat.

Fine game for online play since having opponents in the game doesn't really matter.
Yes the different sets introduce different cards, too bad it all feels the same - and to me the feeling is DULL.

Having had the chance to play the cards in multiple combinations, I'd highly recommend this game.  It's definately on the lighter side so it may be a better filler game before or after a heavier game.  However, it does have the potential to be a "main game", especially if a 10-15 action card expansion is released to provide even further complexity and variations to the base game.

RATING: 8
This is a fun card set-collection game where players try to earn the most points.  Throughout the game players try to decide which cards should be purchased to give them the most benefit.  Early in the game players will buy action cards and later in the game (crunch time!) players will race to purchase victory point cards.  When to make that transition is often the key to success.

Rating based on play of finalized prototype. Bland, tit-for-tat action. I'll give it a few more tries in the hopes of finding something more to it since the basic idea of building your deck as you play is a good one. I suspect it may take another game that further develops this mechanism to truly interest me though.

We enjoy and play a lot this incredibly simple game with only cards, loads of cards.
Different strategies can be applied about what cards to buy at every moment (you are choosing all game long whether to buy action cards, money cards or VP cards)
It's got huge replayability: there are so many possible action card combinations within the basic 25 types that we don't feel the need of getting any expansion.
Our younger daughter, aged 10, loves it and she's perfectly able to go for her own combos.
And yes, frequently shuffling is needed, but it's not that hard.

There is some strategy in trying to find the best card combinations in order not polute your deck. You also have to know when to switch from building you deck to acquiring VP cards.

Un jeu à avoir. Un très bon jeu de ''deck building''. Les règles sont simples et les actions sur les cartes sont bien décrites. Les cartes sont superbes. Le jeu se joue relativement rapidement. Il y a de la stratégie car vous devez essayer de trouver les meilleurs combinaisons de cartes dans le but de ne pas polluer son ''deck''. Vous devez également savoir quand arrêter de bâtir votre main et commencer à acquérir des points de victoire

A very good game, but can sometimes lack interaction between players depending on the Kingdom cards out.

I've seen some more recent reviews now taking the perspective of viewing Dominion as the now out-classed grandfather of deck building games.

I have to admit, I haven't played the newer ones - but whenever I see reviews or watch youTubes of them, I don't see enough new ideas in them to want to invest the cash to replace Dominion yet.

RATING: 7.5
After all the hype, I found the base set to be kind of bland. Still, this game has done a lot of the medium, and the expansions look like they have awesome cards. Without having played anything except the base set, I would recommend starting with Intrigue first. After playing with the base set, those cards feel like they'd be more interesting.

Update: I played some more and finally 'got' it. There actually is interactivity in the pacing of your deck and variance control, and while the game is still somewhat about finding the best combos, there's enough variety here to last forever. It really helped that I played with my friend's copy of the expansions though, the base game is still bland.

Edit: Sold base game to a friend starting his gaming collection. Dominion was good for me while I had it, but ultimately I had to make a decision: buy a bunch of expansions, or maintain a version of the game that people aren't talking about/devising strategies for/excited to play anymore. This game was destined for online play from the very beginning; soon, that will be the best way to play.

I played Intrigue before I played base set... and I must say that I like Intrigue better.  The base set is just "blah"... Intrigue adds a lot more spice that really makes it zing for me.

I played it a bunch when it first came out... liked it but wasn't hooked. Then the more I played it the more I didn't really like it. I liked other games better. Now I played it a few more times recently and it seems to be growing on me again.

I still don't love it, but since it's pretty quick and a decent amount of strategy for a quick game, and it's very replayable it's getting up there. It helps that it's basically a classic at this point and classic replayable games usually get higher ratings for me.

Played the standard setup and it was a good game.  I don't know if I'd purchase it because of all the variable setups and extra cards in the deck.  I'm not a fan of alternate versions / supplements to games and to throw them all in one box just sets up a situation where different game groups across the country have different ideas of the very best card mix to play the game with.  I prefer standard constructions in my games.

Dominion has surprised me in many different ways. The replayability of this is outstanding because there are so many roles. This game can easily be expanded by just printing new roles. The game also appeals to CCG players as it is a drafting mechanic and trying to figure out the most optimal play. It's a fairly balanced game and none of the roles are too extreme in suckage or in overpowered. I expect this game to be in the top 50 for a long time, if not top 10.

I'll say a few things about Dominion, none particularly insightful. The first few times I played it I liked it: it was breezy, it was simple, it was clever. But it very slowly started to feel like Pre-Game to me over time. It also just started to feel dry and unexciting: scan the market for cards that synergize, form a strategy, buy the individual parts of your engine, then see if it succeeds faster than your opponent(s). I can see the draw in how strategically-focused it is, but for me, it felt like a weird engine-building game where you're just hoping that synergizing parts of your engine get drawn into your hand each turn. 

If I want to build an engine, then I want to see if I can build an engine. I don't want to select engine parts and have them handed to me 5 at a time and hope that they can be assembled in the sequence in which I'm given them.

So far everyone loves this game, and everyone wants to play multiple times.  That's the definition of a great game, isn't it? I stopped short of 10 because of the rare times when a random spread produces a slow, plodding game with no opportunities for exciting turns.  I've seen that happen twice out of 20+ plays though, so I'm not too worried about it.

Also, it's not just a game, it's a game system.  I anticipate many, many cards being printed in the near future.

17/02/2013: Played it twice at a board gaming meetup. Seems too cumbersome to play, given the need to shuffle the discard pile so many times throughout the entire game. Almost felt like multi-player solitaire if not for the attack cards, and understanding the various combo options is key to winning the game. It was a good experience trying out this highly-rated game, though the BGG rating is one which I would disagree with.

I own every card from Dominion, and I don't regret any of it, even Alchemy. The deckbuilding mechanics of Dominion are ridiculously well-refined, even if some of the cards aren't, and gameplay has only gotten better with more expansions.

RATING: 4.5
Finally got around to play it and am a bit disappointed. For a boardgame, it is not very interactive and every player is kind of brewing his own soup and you can pretty much play the game while ignoring the other players. Especially with experienced players / seasoned players, the game plays very fast and more like a quick game of cards (without any bluffing/betting etc), rendering the in-game communication to a minimum. The theme is quite generic and I would have prefered a more gritty setting, dark ages instead of medieval. I quite like the idea of a new and random set up of cards each time you play, but overall. the player-player interactivity is way too limited for a boardgame.

EDIT: I had the chance to play it again with three out of four players (including me) being newbies and inexperienced and I had more fun this time. I actually noticed what was going on and at least attempted to think of something which remotely resembled a strategy. I reckon if I would play this game with a bunch of new players who play this game SLOWLY (what is it with some geeks, going for the speed record, how fast can I play the game?), I would enjoy it more. I think Dominion can be played fast, but I would rather play it with people that take longer to make their move and give me more time doing mine. Anyway, I like it better than the first time and I will play it again, but I am still not convinced it is such a great game. HX

RATING: 5.5
A dexterity game where the player who shuffles the slowest loses.  And that's only partly in jest.  It's amazing how antsy experienced players get when they have to wait for the novice to read his cards.

This is an okay game.  Players start out with a set deck of cards.  On a turn, players play what cards they can and discard the rest.  Cards provide points, money and other types of powers.  Throughout the game players use their existing cards to acquire new ones.  If properly chosen the new cards will combine to produce additional fun combinations of card play and more points.

Game play is simple to the point of being simplistic.  It's the card combos that add what spice there is to the game.  There's a few "screw your neighbor" cards, but mostly players will be racing to get the desirable cards into their deck as fast as possible.

Basically this is your standard Efficiency Engine game built around a novel deck building mechanism.  For me, a novel mechanism does not a good game make.  On one hand the game is light and fluffy and takes hardly any time at all to play.  On the other it strives for complexity in the card combos.  It goes by too fast to enjoy what complexity there is, while being too fiddly and full of pieces to justify the quick playing time.  It's sort of like listening to Beethoven's fifth sped up to twice the normal speed.

Maybe if I played it enough so that I could process the card combos and endless shuffling without thinking, thus freeing me to observe what my opponents are doing, the game would become more interesting.  But its not inspiring enough to devote that kind of time to.

It desperately needs card protectors since some cards will get worn out much faster than others.  The graphic design of the cards leave much to be desired.  The card backs are atrocious and the art, while not bad, is just generic fantasy and I'm sick of generic fantasy.

I suspect the number of expansions for this game will make its fans groan beneath the financial burden of trying to acquire them all.

Kind of has that awkward time slot where its between a filler and a full game. Interesting. Kind of hard to lug it around for what it feels like too. This game doesn't overstay its welcome, has good mechanics, very straightforward (with good strategy), and has little downtime between turns. The main problem I have with this is that it has very little player interaction. We find ourselves talking anyways, but it feels like a lot of the things that other people do don't affect your actions (my friends thought the same way too). The artwork is also kinda lacking. It has a great insert though!

I have got to admit:  THIS GAME IS GOOD!  It is a fast playing game that is just fun. 

Downgraded to 7.  The game is too anti-social.  It is good, but way too much shuffling 02/12/12 [7]

I understand the "it plays itself" complaints. We still have quite a few kingdom cards to try, but it's taking more and more effort to pull this one off the shelf.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I was tempted to increase my rating after deciding to never play the game with random kingdom cards, only predetermined sets, but I decided I still need to be talked into playing it for these reasons:

1. My biggest complaint is waiting for what feels like 10 minutes or more while someone takes their turn, drawing and reshuffling and drawing and on and on with some of the combo cards.

2. I also get bored with the constant shuffling myself.

3. It never comes out when playing with regular board gamers. It's always with children and beginners. If my regular group wants to play something competitive we go with heavier games where we can plan out our moves, if we want something lighter we go for a game with less waiting between turns.

All that being said, I've played the game about 80 times, (and I finally bought a copy if you're reading this Dale). It seemed like a game that I needed in my Library now that my nephews can play it. But I still don't understand the Dominion fanboys.

This is not my kind of game; I don't like economic engine games. At least it's over in less than half an hour.

There are two things I don't like about economic engine games: [1] Lack of player interaction and [2] The emphasis on figuring out which combination of special powers works best.

Dominion emphasizes this combination, which most people find appealing (but unfortunately I don't). You typical economic engine/role selection game has some kind of mechanism that rewards or forces players to pick different special powers or roles. In Dominion, you can freely choose which special power you want (as long as you can afford it). So basically the key to winning Dominion is to figure out one, and only one, problem: [b]Which combination of special powers will win me the game?[/b] There are no sneaky role stealing tactics as in other economic engine games or any reason to pay attention to what your opponents are up to. If you're the first one to figure that problem out (and you're lucky enough to get lots of money early in the game), you've won.

Personally, I don't care for games that are about assembling combos of special powers. However, the majority of the board gaming world thinks the opposite, which probably explains the high ratings for the game.

=====

On an unrelated note, stay away from this game if you have carpal tunnel syndrome; the frequent shuffling will trigger its symptoms.

Dominion is a tiring game. It is a good game, however, if you don't mix the expansions, the base game is very limited. It is fast, though, and can be explained easily to anyone just approaching board games. I wouldn't recommend it to hard gamers.

First true deck building game. Simple, easy to learn game with plenty of replay value even with the base but I do see purchasing expansions in the future. Enjoy trying to figure out the best combo with the given cards. After 4 plays this game becomes a top 5.

RATING: 8.25
This can be an enjoyable game depending on which ten (10) cards are pulled from the set to make your game.  You start by laying out on the table all the Money decks (3), Point decks (3) and the trash card (1).  The rest of the table is made up of ten (10) cards randomly drawn from the base set (and or expansions).  These ten mini decks will be used to play the game.  Players start with ten cards six (6) copper and four (4) 1 point.  Shuffle your ten (10) cards and draw five.  Your turn sequence consists of one (1) action and one (1) buy.  You buy from the mini decks on the table.  All the cards played including newly purched are put in the discard pile.  Draw five and follow sequence.  When you run out of cards shuffle your discard deck and finish drawing again.  Game ends when three piles run empty or all the Province cards are drawn.  Winner is the person with the most points.

Great intro into deck-building. We haven't bought any expansions but the base game alone is great. Nothing bad to say about the game but we have adjusted one rule to make the game play better for us. We adjust the cost of the VP cards by three dollars each and this extends the length of the game and encourages the use of action cards.

I could play it cool, and say that there was WAY too much hype for this game, and it isn't all that, but damn!  I can't remember being so surprised by a game as this one.  
I'd almost given up on BGG recommendations, after being disappointed by almost every game in the past couple years that has had hype, but this game is truly a revelation. How someone can come up with such a unique mechanic as shared decks but customized deck construction is brilliant.
Not only is the mechanic brand-new to gaming, it seems balanced and eminently replayable due to so many cards and combinations and gamestyles.
I will look to get in more games to try this out more.

A Deck-Drafting/Resource management game that is surprisingly quick to setup/down (thanks to the already included divider) and swift to play. The base game for novices has clear cut strategies, but as you get into the variants the real ability to play the long macro-game reveals itself.

Fans of San Juan and Race for the Galaxy will find more of the same to like here, I liked it, although I want to spend more time with the rulebook to be sure that the game can run away just as fast as one player managed to do in my first play.  If you can, Then the game simply is just a matter of memorizing the effects of the cards and using that information, Sort of like role choosing in San Juan is.

Playing online, it is really frustrating that while I know the cards, I don't yet know how they all best work together, and some people have obviously dedicated their every waking thought to that endeavor.  Sucked the fun right out of it.

I remember playing Dominion a few years back and not really enjoying it. Perhaps it was the company or maybe I wasn't in the mood, because it has absolutely skyrocketed to the top of the charts in the last few months. Like Battlelore, Dominion offers the gameplay of a CCG without the heavy financial investment. It's reasonably easy to teach, even easier to play, and plays quickly enough for my gaming group to go for several rounds in a single gaming session. My gaming group's obsession might possibly die out someday, but it certainly won't be any time soon.

RATING: 10
We simply love it. Every game brings new, interesting card combinations and strategies and after about twenty plays we still think we're just scratching the surface. Ultimately there's a finite number of efficient strategies, but the base set alone provides many fun, fast paced and exciting games. And while experienced players will fare better, it's very easy to grasp even for newcomers.

UPDATE: After multiple plays I feel I really should bump it up to 10, because I can never get enough of it. One of the games I'd consider for the holidays on a desert island. Mind you, the rating is for the entire "Dominion" series; the base game alone doesn't provide enough replayability.

One minor complaint: the money strategy is too powerful. NOT unbeatable, but too powerful for what it is.

Granddaddy of the deck-building genre. Once you get the concept/mechanic down, it plays very quickly. The expansions help to provide variety, but now there is expansion overload.

Really very fun. Build a deck of cards by "buying" them with money cards, create a deck to unleash killer card combos and buy land (victory point) cards. I like it because it is deep, highly replayable and most importantly: [i]fun[/i].

Repeated plays show just how deep Dominion really is. We play almost exclusively with just the base set and we're STILL finding new combinations or ways to approach the use of the various cards.

Also of note Dominion is the granddaddy of the deck building genre, a big claim to fame.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Get it. It's perfect. With expansions it has endless replayability. Once you get tired of the pre-made sets, just randomize. You have to think of strategies on the fly. Sure there are overall strategies, but how you achieve them changes from play to play. And occasionally some set of 10 comes along where you have a stroke of genius and come up with something totally unique.

Ranking* of expansions:
1) Prosperity
2) Dark Ages
3) Guilds
4) Seaside
5) Hinterlands
6) Intrigue
7) Cornucopia
8) Alchemy

*Relative to other Dominion sets. Honestly they're all 10's (except maybe Cornucopia and Alchemy).

WOW! Just came back from Spill-o-rama in Stavanger, Norway, where a nice dane :-) had brought a prototype of this game. And what a game! This might very well become a new classic - a brilliant deck building mechanism, very well balanced and varied cards and so beautifully quick to play. I can't wait to get my hands on a published copy. Thanks, Donald, for giving me a new favourite card game, whoever you are!

RATING: 8
Interesting in-game deck building mechanic.  The coolest thing about the game is the infinite replayability in that you choose 10 card types out of 25 possible to play with.  That's over 3 million different game configurations. You have a slightly better chance of playing the same game twice than you do of winning the lottery.  Some game configurations are more tense than others, but so far, it's always been fun!  

Update: the more I play it, the higher my rating goes.  After my initial two plays, I rated it a 7, three more a 7.5, three more after that an 8.  I'm getting hooked quick!  
Ok, I've upgraded to an 8.5 because I play it way more than anything else and I'm not close to getting tired of it yet.  It's an addiction.

We love this game.  It takes about three run throughs to really understand how to play, but once you get your third game in, even new players can beat seasoned vets (provided you have a decent strategy).  I've always liked card games like "Magic: The gathering." but hated how expensive it was to build a deck.  Well with this brilliant little ditty, the pain of buying the cards becomes the fun part of the game. The game comes with all the cards you need to play close to a million different combinations without ever buying an expansion pack.  And it's simple enough that you can play with multi-lingual crowds without having to explain too much.

There is a bit of meta-strategy to the game.  There are pretty much three major ways to play with minor variants to each strategy depending on what's out and who's playing with you, however, these strategies counter each other quite well.  The one downside is that if your strategy is failing the game doesn't allow for the flexibility to change strategy mid-game (unless you've got the chapel) and it can be a rather slow death.  However, game-play is so fast that you can try out two or three different methods in a night and quickly figure out what you did wrong in games previous.

Great game.

Never got into this game. First, I could only partly grasp the deck-building concept when I first got it. Second: I think the manual is poorly laid out and written. Third: personal circumstances I guess (didn’t have experienced people to show me how it worked). 

Finally understood the concept of deck-building when playing Tanto Cuore on the iPad. Now, I can’t go back to the idea of constant shuffling. Gameplay on a computer, + over a network suits me better.

Even if I return to this game once in a while (online version), imo it has some problems:

1. Scaling - not present. If one player is better, you can tell she/he is better after 30% of the game. No fun.

2. Price - it's is overpriced comparing to other card games like Race for the Galaxy or LCGs (Arkham, LotR etc.), they have more variety of cards and strategies = and more fun.

3. Too simple, too little pieces, no variety - some cards are good, the others are not. If you choose bad ones or bad combos or have too many cards, you lose. The whole idea of the game is being able to recognize which cards/combos are good, and which are not. After 20-30 plays (which are short) you kind of know, and then the game can easily become boring (too little, too simple).

I was going to rank this an 8, but then I saw BGG's caption for 9 was "Excellent - very much enjoy playing," which perfectly describes how I feel about Dominion. It's actually possible that I will rank this game a 10 after some more plays. I played it for the first time ever at PAX Unplugged 2017, and since then I have not been able to stop thinking about it. I must have played 50 games of it online in the last two weeks alone. I'm reading Dominion Strategy constantly ... in short, I am becoming obsessed. I really enjoy this game. I do worry that once I become familiar with all the cards, it will start to lose some of its luster, but I guess that's what the expansions are for.

Update

I revised my rating from an eight to a nine after getting Seaside.  The options and interactions available in this game system are so varied and interesting that Dominion has become an indispensable game.  The expansions change the utility of the cards in the base game, which changes the way the game plays in a very positive manner.  Each card gives me something new to think about when compared to each other card.  Even with only using ten cards every game, each player will see different advantages in the available options meaning that people who often play together can shape each other's strategies.  Dominion has become a game that builds upon itself.  It's addictive because each expansion seems to offer the options of the previous game and more options that have yet to be explored!

Played one game with the "First play" card-set, and knew that my family would love this game, especially my wife.  We got it, and both my wife and daughter (age 11) enjoy playing.  Now my son (age 9) plays too.  I can almost always find somebody that will play me.

This game was my first exposure to a non-collectible deck building game. The problem that I have with this game is the lack of theme. It just doesn't feel like I'm a monarch trying to build a larger kingdom. I love how the cards can combo together and how every player can go a different path and still have a chance to win. I'll still play the game as a two player game with my wife and as a gateway game to get someone ready for Thunderstone.

Update: I finally played the game using the randomizer cards. Playing with the new cards definitely made the game more interesting for me. Looking forward to my next play.

RATING: 5
I don't see where the hype came from. It is just one mechanic over and over again. Bleh... . You can deal a different starting cards and you would have a different strategic puzzle to solve but it is not interesting for me. Games plays automatically 90% of the time and you have to shuffle cards all the time. 

Theme, or rather lack of it as some may say, doesn't bother me at all. I'm not really hard into theme so if you are you may consider it as another problem with the game.  

I will never suggest it and would rather play something else. However i would pick it over doing something alone in a corner so there goes the rating.

Wow, the different strategies are endless... love this game. It took me about 20 plays to understand how to play this game... yes I know you buy and draw cards blah blah blah, but I thought that the game was pretty random.  Now I see that players need to control their deck in such a way that would give a jealous lover a run for their money.

Note to self (My number of plays reflects every game of dominion with all expansions included. )

RATING: 7.25
Awesome game.  Plays differently depending on which action cards are available.  Lots of depth and interactive feel.  Different than Race for the Galaxy, but adds depth to the genre.  The open-ended expansions add potential, but it also makes this more like MtG.  The downsize of MtG also appears in repetitive/killer combos from people who obsessively play the game too much and take the fun out of it.  Also, the game seems to suffer from nearly optimized strategies as people overplay the game.  As the game matures, it starts to feel like Magic, but with fixed (and optimized) decks.

A true worthy challenger to Race for the Galaxy's throne as the perfect 30 minute card game.  Love the unique mechanic of building your deck as part of the gameplay.  The deck variations make for a highly replayable game, although some random combinations can be less satisfying than others.

Deck-building game, with a tacked on and weak theme, but the mechanic is what makes this game great. 
I don't agree with those who come with the infinite replayablity of the base-game, but with the expansions on the horizont the game has much promise. 
Because of the short playing time there is always time for "one more round".

Strategy is deeper than it appears and not as intuitive as one would think.  I tend to get frustrated by games where there is a statistical best strategy with little player interaction. Shuffling constantly is a bit annoying.  Would love to high quality sleeve it but would be too expensive.

Dominion grew on me. Usually I prefer longer games, with some long development arc of strategy or tactics. But Dominion is addictive, and there certainly is strategy to it. The base game is very playable on its own, and each expansion has added interest and variety. We especially enjoy the Seaside and Prosperity expansions; Alchemy, not so much.

RATING: 7.5
The first deck-building game I've played. Even though I've played this at least 40 times, I still don't win at it very often. The attacks and curses piss me off and I like playing without those available. In the end, this is just a card game that I grew tired of. I would rather play Trains over this.

The more I play this game, the more I like it.  Kinda scratches the old Magic CCG itch without the billions of dollars Magic requires..... well.. at least until the expansions come out.

Update 3/6/10 :  I was rereading my comments and felt I did this game a slight disservice by giving it a 2 sentence review.  I like Dominion because of its speed of play, its variability between games due to the different cards, and the completeness of its rules.  If you come upon a question in the game, chances are it is answered in the index - if only all games were this water tight.

The speed of the game allows multiple plays at each session which is a big plus for me - as much as I would like to sit down and burn 5 hours playing games those days are - for the most part - gone.  Dominion is easy to get in a quick game here and there.

Looking forward to more cards over time.

It's like McDonald's food: it's easy and everyone loves it, but it's bad for you and the difference is just illusion - all the food comes out of a vat at the back. I can see how recovering Magic:tG addicts might like it, but please don't share your needle with me!  I think this and many modern boardgames are inspired by a trope or mindset in net-based computer gaming where the underlying game is not really that interesting but people hang on to see what trick the next level brings (in the hope that it will make the game more interesting). The trick here is of course that each game can include a different set of cards yielding possible new killer combos.

Still the best deck builder out there IMO. It was also one of, if not THE, first of its kind. The theme is kind of tacked on, sure, but the mechanics are very solid.

While the game is a great intro game for new people, I find Dominion very simple and non-surprising after several plays.  Literally all you do in the game is use cards to get enough money and then use the money to buy victory point cards in order to end the game.  Nothing more strategic or cut-throat than that.

This was one of the first games I experienced in the new generation of board games.  Even prior to Pandemic.  I purchased this game soon after Pandemic (a few weeks later) and have found this game to be sooooo satisfying.

The diversity in replay value is so strong because you'll quite literally never play the same game twice.  I have several expansions and it's all just amazing.  I know there are some people who think Dominion has overstayed it's welcome.  Not here.  I look forward to getting more and more expansions.

My brother said this was like a collectible card game without the 'collectible' part.  With so many 'expansions' out I'm beginning to doubt this.

However, this is a fun game with a good amount of of strategy and re-playability.  There's some luck involved, but when you are the one building your own deck, it is somewhat your own fault if you draw a bad hand.  If you weren't constantly shuffling the cards I think I'd like it more.

RATING: 8.5
It scratches the same itch as Magic: The Gathering. I've taught countless people to play the game so far, and I've found no-one who doesn't like it.
It does get progressively more complex with the expansions, and if you do start collecting them inoovative storage is required!
Although I really like the game, I'm a little burned out on it at the moment.

RATING: 6
A smooth but repetitive deckbuilder classic.

There's huge variety during set-up, especially if you have its expansions. So it's interesting deciding your strategy at the start depending on what decks are being made available.

However, after that you'll tend to be going around and around in circles doing similar actions all game. 

You'll still need to be clever to play this game well. Good judgement is key. It's just a shame that the amount of thinking is dwarfed by the hundreds of times you'll be moving cards around.

After about 40 games vs computer AI (using two of the expansions) and 2 vs real people, my concern is that it has a much less interesting 'balancing act' than deckbuilders like Star Realms or Ascension. In Dominion growth is quite linear: the endgame happens when your deck becomes rich enough to start buying good victory point cards, and it's clearly signposted when your opponent starts doing the same. In Star Realms there's a longer transition between the two stages that is more 'push your luck' and less signposted, adding fun tension. But Dominion is infinitely more interesting when you begin the game, thanks to its endless combinations of decks.

Edit: For awhile I resisted Dominion, because of its "multiplayer solitaire" reputation and lack of theme (along with its mediocre to horrible art). I didn't have a whole lot of fun playing this with 4 players, though I appreciated the mechanic. But, I got this in the Unity auction (and traded for Seaside and Intrigue), and we're really enjoying this as a two-player game. I haven't won yet. It's fun to do a post mortem and see what went wrong, and how you could have been more effective.

I still don't love the end game / province rush (which was a disappointing denouement with 4 players), but I'm looking forward to seeing Prosperity's effect on this. I'm also looking forward to new combinations with the other expansions I picked up.

The archetype deck building game. I quite enjoy that Dominion is reduced/focused on only this mechanism. There are a few cons, as the little advantage for the start player and the absence of theme.

We play w/ 2 with the recommended decks for the first game.  Very fun a first than it dragged a bit and it felt as if we where trying to move quicker to end this.  The starting recommendation must be pretty vanilla compared to some of the other decks.  Fun and different but not sure I've seen it in its best.  Will give in another try at some point. 
Edit: play two more times with the other recommended combos:  this game grows on you and is quite fun.  Raised my rating.  definitely looking forward to playing again.

Great game both on BSW (real fast game.... 4 games in 30 minutes) and face-to-face (around 30 minutes per game).  Love the deck building idea.  Great with non-gamers.  Wife loves it.  You can decide (through picking your 10 cards) whether you want the game to be confrontational or not.

Update (Feb.'09): It's been 4 or 5 months and this game has not lost any steam.  Study hall kids love it and I've played around 200 games online.  I don't play face to face too much (Agricola, Crokinole, or something else instead).

I've played this a bunch of times with my wife and a few with my parents when they were visiting. Fun game that everyone has enjoyed. 

I'm still a novice, but have had fun experimenting with different cards and combos to see what will work. I think it helps to play this game with people of a similar skill level - I would likely get steamrolled by a good player and not really get much of a feel for what would work. I suppose I'd learn from watching what he or she did, however!

Have played a dozen or so times now and is starting to grow on me.  Four players definitely better than two.  Like to include the witch and gardens to avoid straight race for the provinces scenario.  Probably need to consider getting expansion to add variety.  Everyone else I play with seems to like it more than me.    

Oct 14 - despite being one of my most played games, and despite all the dosh I've sunk on expansions, I'm still not overly sold on Dominion, although I do seem to win more than just about any other game - buy gold and silver a lot, only buy a few actions, and race others to get the most 6 point cards.....hence can get a little tedious. The expansions no doubt add more variety so we need to explore them more to avert this problem.

RATING: 8.55
Dominion is a CCG, but a CCG with a difference. Where-as 90% of the time in most CCGs is anti-social, spent constructing your deck alone, here you build the deck as you play. Each turn you add to your deck, based on the resources drawn from your deck. If you add more resources you can do more in the future, if you add victory cards you increase your chance of winning but your deck will have less useful cards.

The game works very quickly and very elegantly, presenting enough choices to be challenging but not so many as to paralyze player. If it has a flaw it is that much strategy can probably be plotted out in advance.

A great game for a small group of friends.  I suggest the full 4 players for the best games, though 3 is still pretty good.

Its pretty easy to learn and fast to play, though can take awhile to 'master'.  With the 500 some cards in the base set and the different possible setups, this has a LOT of replay value.

RATING: 9
A fantastic, fast paced game.  It's so surprising to find a game with so much replayability and strategy, with such a short game length.  In many ways, it's almost a collectible card game, only no one has to collect anything.  The only flaws I see are that sleeves are not included (would've been nice), and that since many of the cards are similar, so the possibilities aren't quite as unlimited as they suggest.  Regardless, the replayability is fantastic.

Dominion, while being a very popular game, is a
very poorly designed game.

If you simply want action Dominion will fit the bill;
however, depending upon the card decks randomly
assigned for that game, there are a number of things
which can go wrong to ruin the game:

1 The game often will end prematurely before many
Interesting strategies can come into play.

2 Because the costs of many cards were not 
competently Assigned you may get cards such as: 
Ironworks costing only 4, giving you a free 4 cost
card every turn it comes up.
These cards (and there are many of them) tend to
wipe out many of the lower card decks early and
Thus end the game prematurely, before any
Interesting strategies can be developed.

3 Conversely, there are many cards which are
Overpriced, and thus tend not to play a valuable
role in the game.

4 There are a number of cards which literally just
Ruin the game, such as Possession; where there
is no defense and repeatedly one can take turns
away from an opponent to one's side, and if he
in turn has a Possession card, a chain reaction 
can occur with one player possessing and gaining
the benefits from every other player's turn around 
the table.

If the designers had put any shred of competent
Effort into evaluating the costs of cards and assigning
Powers to cards that maintained some game balance,
Dominion could have been a solid game. They did not.

As it is, Dominion merely gives action to players in
a short game without any concern for solid or balanced
game Design nor often allowing players the possibility
of interesting development of strategies.

This is a game for the ADD crowd not for anyone with
an attention span.

The mother of all deck-building games (even though the game itself in a way pays hommage to Magic: The Gathering). The first time I played this game (Noorderspel 2010) I was fairly unimpressed. +card, +action, +buy, etc. This game didn't have a lot of depth, for sure. Well, I was definitely wrong. I gave it a second try and started liking it more and more. After having played about 50-100 games, I got into a new phase of disappointment. I had developed a clear preference for certain patterns, and games often tended to go in a similar way. When I started playing against AI, I noticed that somehow it would buy cards I hadn't even looked at twice, and with great success at that! From then on I started to check out every possible card and would try to see if I could incorporate them in a strategy. To my surprise literally every card has some use in some setups. Even a card like woodcutter, which is not much more than a silver that requires an action is something worthwhile, because it gives you a +buy, which is a GREAT help if you've got let's say 16 money to spend.
I now regularly play Dominion and must say that will all the expansions out, the base game still holds its own quite nicely. Cards like laboratory and festival are still some of my favourites.
The greatest perk of this game though is that with experienced players, you can easily play a game under 30 minutes, regardless with how many players.

better than expected after all the hype it received. I like it. Very replayable, very dependent on experience with this game, but open for surprising combinations. Good for introducing people in boardgames, without frustrating them with too many rules, as you seem to learn this game while playing.
Has a pleasant chance factor that doesn't frustrate as often as you would expect in a card game.

I fell in love with Dominion shortly after our first few games way back in the spring of 2011, shortly after getting into gaming, and it has remained one of my favourite games ever since. It really shines when all of the expansions are included, and the kingdom cards chosen at random - in hindsight, looking back at just the base set now, it does seem rather limited in scope. But this is not how it seemed when we were first discovering it, so even just base dominion still deserves to have one of my few 10 ratings.

Action. Buy....Shuffle, repeat. Can feel a bit repetitive, but a fun little game. 

I've dropped this a 6. The problem? Unless you plan on getting all the expansions, the play becomes mindless...meaning your actual turn is on auto-pilot...the tactical choices are obvious to anyone that's played several rounds of this game. This leave the only interesting decision being the timing and mix of cards to buy into your deck.

(12/08/2008) - This may make me a terrible person, but I will admit I purchased this game after only reading the description and some reviews on BGG. The concept interested me and the glowing reviews sold me on the game.

(01/16/2008) - [9] - Believe it or not, the hype is accurate for this game. I have 6 plays under my belt and I am a believer. I had never encountered the deck-building mechanic prior to this game, so perhaps some of the novelty for it artificially inflates my opinion of the game. That being said, I am giving this a solid 9 and would not be surprised for this to change to a 10 after a few more plays. In terms of raw value alone, you are getting plenty of bang for your buck with the huge pile of cards you get with the game. My only complaint is that I will need to acquire card sleeves for this before my copy gets too beat up.

(09/21/2014) - [7] - I think I've just burnt out on Dominion a bit. I went crazy with expansions and now find myself unwilling to play this a good portion of the time.

+ Can be played during a short lunch break at work easily
+ Different play styles are encouraged by changing the available cards each game which adds to the replayability 
+ Easy enough to track every player's victory points in your head by simply watching Province purchases, which adds to the strategy unlike heavy point salad games which tend to be a dice roll at the end

- Theme isn't really there but I still prefer it more than Ascension visually. 7 Wonders has more theme if that's what you're after in a light card drafting game (although I wouldn't call this a pure drafting game like 7 Wonders)

The only thing wrong with Dominion is that I win every time we play.   :P

Also, maybe the price could go down a little by now yea? 

Third, its kinda boring after a year if you dont get the expansions. And it often feels like no one else is playing even when they attack you lol.

We wanted to play in a tournament at UCON 2012 but with all the new versions and expansions, and their super high prices, we are not familiar with the new cards and mechanics.

I guess Dominion is going the way of MTG: a constant yearly or monthly upkeep cost and if you dont pay for new games you get out of the loop.

That was one possibility, so I accept that its what happened. I was hoping for the other: that 2 or 3 versions come out and they leave it at that, and the game goes down in history and we all love it and cherish it forever.

Oh well, still a fantastic game. Dominion is not a 10, but it is great, no questions asked, period. Anyone who thinks otherwise is being stupid or is stupid.

Intriguing game. We are enjoying getting to know this one. We've only played a couple of two-player games but it has been decent. Interesting mechanics allows you to build your own deck of interactive cards to gain prestige points. A bit fiddly with all of the shuffling but it kind of gives you something to do as you're waiting and thinking. Rating will probably go up.

Update - after more plays, we really don't enjoy it that much. We kept thinking we were "missing" something but really I guess it's a game that just isn't for us. For us, it seemed sort of "samey" each time and we really didn't care what the other was doing too much. More like another version of solitaire. 3-4 player games are much more interesting in our opinion but the game just hasn't had the staying power in our gaming circles.

Die Mutter aller Deckbuilding-Games, inzwischen durch mehrere Expansions ergänzt. Positiv: Es gibt nahezu unendlich viele umstrittene, diskutable, jedenfalls gangbare und in der Regel nie unschlagbare Kartencombos, was den Wiederspielwert erhöht und die Experimentierfreude beflügelt. Negativ: Thematisch-atmosphärisch ist das Spiel leider nicht. Und jeder Spieler spielt für sich allein.

I'll admit I didn't care for the game that much at first, but it's really grown on me. Even with the basic game, there are lots of combinations and it plays differently every time out. The base game hits a sweet spot with the right mix of cards such that the game is just about the right length for the depth. Most of the interesting decisions center around which card to buy when, and manging your deck.

I noticed I did not have any comments for dominion.  I guess it is because while I enjoy it I'm not sure why I don't enjoy it even more, based on theme and quickness of play.   Partly I think it is because it can be very different game depending on who is playing.  Sometimes it is a nasty screw people game other times it is pleasant game of building.   I think what happens for me is it becomes mechanical but I'll keep trying ant that is why it'll stay an eight for now.

This game is like a bad ex. I don't really respect it, and I don't really respect myself for liking it, but I can't really help the fact that I want to play again.

Or: it's kind of like Taco Bell. Successfully engineered to push all my addiction buttons, but without any kind of the subtle, supple depth that deeply interactive games have.

I once played a game of this back-to-back with a game of Ra, after which I sort of stepped back and saw the shallowness of the Dominion experience. I mean: it's an interesting puzzle. But that thing that happens in games where you carefully try to figure out what the other people's plans are and try to become telepathic and subtly manipulate the game in your favor... it doesn't really have that very much.

BUT: it is a brilliant new mechanic, it is slick, it does act on the brain like crack, and I eagerly wait the coming of a genuinely beautiful, thoughtful, supple game built on the cold skeleton of this machine.

UPDATE: Over it. Don't want to play it again.

its addictive...but it's not actually that good.

it gives us a new mechanic which is nice but i hope other game use it better

whenever i play i feel there's a really good game in there somewhere but the expansions just lead me to believe the 'development' of this is going in the wrong way

also the pure cash strategy is just too powerful. the values of all the cards need changing to stop this. unfortunately instead of rectifying this they chose just to produce more and more cards

pity

update - thinking and playing more this games greatest failing is a lack of thoroughness in its desgin - so many random sets can be unenjoyable and the designer should have avoided this by testing what sets actually work and giving strick guideline to set creation - they didnt so half the game u will play will suck

Those aspects right there, keep me coming back for more. I enjoy all the cards in all the various combinations with the filthy Bureacrat being my favorite card.

I am so tempted to call this FLUXX done right.  In FLUXX you start with a simple rule (Draw 1, Play 1) and the cards change all that until the goal is reached.  Here it is Play 1 Action, Buy 1 Card and the cards change all that until the goal is reached.  Of course, there are key differences, FLUXX is random with a blind draw.  Here the options are open and players manage their hands, decks, and card play to work toward the goal.  Relatively simple rules, but the key is in the interaction of the cards in hand to drive towards the goal of most VPs.  

Speedy play, some interaction makes this a fun game to add to any collection.  And having played all my games F2F - I can state, the "worry" about constant shuffling is not a bother as the next person can start playing while the previous person is "cleaning-up" without delaying the game...

 One of the few games that as soon as one play is over, folks are asking to play again.  As an added benefit, game also plays well with kids.  My 10yo daughter likes the game and has asked to play the game again and again.

A good deal of variety in the box with 25 possible decks (of which only 10 are used per game) adding to replay value, though even the basic set can be played a few times without the game getting dull.

RATING: 4
Much as I like card games, I found this not very interactive, apart from the Militia, and it had too much shuffling, not to mention card text (though I've known a lot worse) in a very small font. At least we were spared the iconographical snowstorm of RftG. The thematic relevence is also very low and I had my doubts about whether some of the cards were ever worth buying.  But it goes along at a nice pace, so I'm happy to play again; but I won't be buying.

**Update** Rating down from original 6.5

This game restored my faith in the possibility of creating new genres of games, rather than just variations and rehashes of old ideas.

Then, the stream of uncreative clones smashed that faith.  But I don't blame Dominion for being better than most of its successors.

Dominion has its problems, and I forgive them.  Especially since the later expansions help a lot to fix them.

RATING: 7.5
Rating likely to go up slightly after more play.  Innovative design.  Really rather unfortunate graphics throughout: small type in largely unused text boxes, ugly card backs, unbelievably useless and confusing cards to mark the end of each stack, forgettable pictures.  In spite of this, the gameplay was fun enough, though not nearly as quick as I'd been led to believe.
----------
EDIT: Rating likely to hover around here or float slightly down.  Kinda samey, and VERY little fun interaction.  Still a neat mechanism, but it's no RftG.  The poker chip version is a genius idea and will play better than shuffling thirty times a game.
----------
EDIT: As predicted, down a hair.  Just not that thrilling.
----------
EDIT: Rating down more.  Repetitive and boring.  Luckily it's also harmless and short, so I won't pitch a fit when it's brought out, but I'll always prefer a game of Race for the Galaxy, and I certainly won't want to play it more than once in a row.
----------
EDIT: Down again.  Probably as low as it can go.  I just don't find it fun enough to do the thinking about it I'd need to do to get good at it.  
----------
EDIT: No explanation for it, but I've enjoyed it well enough these last couple of times, so I bumped the rating a bit
----------
EDIT: Just added another point.  Perhaps I'm just in the mood for slightly more "autopilot" sorts of games now?

The game is okay, but Euros aren't my thing generally. I've played this with the family at Christmas and it's enjoyable. But the reality is that it's basically multi-player solitaire. I prefer games with much more player interaction.

I love card games, but I felt like this was a little too formulaic for my tastes.

I never really cared for playing with or against combo oriented decks in MtG. This basically pits one combo deck against another so for me this is a boring snooze fest that I will do my best to avoid playing...

Take everything that is broken about trading card games, and make a game out of it.  That's Dominion.  Good points are it can be fun and fast.  Bad points are the rich get richer and tend to run away with the game.  There are lots of expansions which can be great, but if you're unfamiliar with them, you'll spend too much time reading the cards, and you may not be able to exploit card combinations before your opponents get too far ahead.

Excellent game. I was a diehard MTG fan - now I'm a diehard Dominion fan. Though now that I have played a bunch of Dominion, it makes me want to try out the other deck building games that have more player interaction.

Surprisingly cool game!  The fun of deck-building without the off-putting collectible nonsense.  The central game mechanic is clever and elegant - play an action, buy a new card, discard your remaining hand, and draw 5 new cards.  The couple dozen different types of cards that come with the game are all interesting.  Play with 10 random sets of them, and every game is truly interestingly different.  It really has that "That was cool, let's play again!" quality.  (Partly that is due to the cumbersomeness of setting up and putting away, though... as long as it's out, let's play again!)

As a longtime CCG player, I personally love this game and wonder why nobody ever thought of it before.  I have taught this to gamers and non-gamers with ease.  Even people who were predisposed *not* to like it have enjoyed the experience.  It is indeed addictive.

UPGRADED from 8 to 10.  Our family now plays this more than "Settlers," often 3 times in a row.  If Settlers is a "10" and we play this more often, it must also be a "10"!

Cards you say, no, seriously, only cards, no tokens no nothing? I could not make up my mind to buy this game or not, but, needless to say, I bought the base game. After 2 days I bought Intrigue and after a few more, I bought Seaside. This is one hell of a good game. Yes, it is only cards and there is A LOT of them which makes this game replayable over and over again. One of those games which I would suggest buying for new gamers. YEAR 2011 - still sick with it and still buying expansions mhuahahaha :P YEAR 2012 - brake. YEAR 2013 - I'm back baby haha :) BUY BUY BUY. YEAR 2014 - the best deck builder ever made :)

I absolutly love this game, only three games played so far but every single game was so enjoyable, great variety, great replay value.

Can't wait to buy the other expansions and play with the ones I have.

One of the biggest strengths that I like about the game is the play time, and the fact that every game it challenges you to find the best combinations with the available cards that are dealt.

And Everyone's strategy is different.

Just plain old fantastic game.  

Update:

Played with attack and curse cards tonight.  Adds some nastiness to the game.  Opponent didn't like curses too much (cost him 4 points, me 0 points) - He should have bought attack cards and payed me back =)

I loved the attack cards and curse cards, it adds the much needed interaction and flavor to the game.  Without them I don't think I would play this game as much.

Probably one of the three most popular card games along with Magic and Netrunner. Base game cards have a medieval village theme. Players take turns adding cards to or removing cards from their deck in order to implement a wide variety of strategies. Players then use these strategies to add victory point cards to their deck. Whoever has the most victory points at the end, wins. Simple to play but really deep with strategy. The good players know how to adjust to the other players on the fly as the game progresses which is vital. I don't think any two games will ever play out the same way.

This was my "gateway" game into DBGs.  I loved it and have since become quite the DBG addict!  I love the variability this has with all the different cards.  We actually bought an app that allows to put in what versions we want to use and then randomize the game.  This is especially important because we usually play two player.  If you are teaching, picking the cards is best as it allows the most control (or use one of their suggested lists), but for experienced players, the random approach makes it more fun and harder. (JW)

----------

I have mixed feelings about the game... sometimes I really enjoy it, and other times I'm turned off because, even though you can mix the 25 different cards into so many different 10-card combos, the gameplay and choices are still pretty much the same. 

Once you have picked a strategy, the game plays on auto-pilot.  It's just not that appealing to me -- if I wanted a light card game, I'd rather play Battle Line or Glory to Rome

RATING: 5
This is a classic game where players buy cards to put into their deck. The cards add more money or actions or buy victory points which can take up spaces in your deck but are required to win the game. The most victory points wins the game. 

Pros:easy and fun card play, fast playing time. Many different card options adding to tremendous amount of replay ability, different game every time you play.Easy setup

Cons:Not very strategic, large amount of luck,no real theme to the game

Favorite thing to say during this game is "It takes a village" whenever I play the Village card.  This game is fun, but I feel like it has grown stale with me over time.  Maybe it's the fact that it's too basic in it's gameplay, all you use it cards.  I imagine the expansions give the game more life.  If you want something super easy to set up and quick to play, this works well.

--Nov2008-- Yeah; there's lots of shuffling.  But I didn't find that I minded at all.  The game is pretty nice - though I'm not sure I get the "CCG Deck Construction" metaphor quite as strongly as I might have expected from the descriptions I'd read.  It's certainly true there's some "deck construction":  but I've never attempted to construct a Magic deck quite so iteratively, nor under anything resembling the constraints of _Dominion_.  The game stands on it's own; it's worth buying.
--Dec2008-- Gift from 2008 Secret Santa - Thanks!
--Dec2009-- Ended up trading copy to youngest son (the biggest Dominion fan in the house, and owner of both the expansions) in exchange for his copy of Kingsburg (that he didn't like.)  Not sure it was a good trade for me, but it made him happy :)

A great engine building game.  The best aspect of this title for me is the length of play.  This is easily a lunch hour candidate and on top of that it's very easy and quick to get new players in.  Right now the special cards are a bit vanilla, so I'm eager to see what is yet to come...  This game is very expandable and I expect it to have serious legs.

I used to play a *lot* of Dominion, so much so that I got burned out on it, and tired of the fact that 90% of the strategy of the game was decided before the first card was played, and from then on out it was simply a matter of whose deck randomly let them implement their strategy (or, in most cases, "the one prevalent optimal strategy for the collection of cards") the best.

I have also come to realize that I prefer rotating-supply DB games like Ascension or Star Realms, or ones with other mechanics like Eminent Domain, to static-supply games like Dominion.

(Update: rating went up- my 11-year-old simply loves this game!)

Family-friendly card game with original concept. Despite zillion possibilities to choose 10 out of 25 action cards, there's less variety than you would expect. Not much interaction- even the "evil" cards like curse, thief, witch etc. are only mildly annoying, thus adding to the family-friendliness. Decent, but a bit repetitive.

This hasn't clicked for me yet, even though it seems like something I should enjoy. This is one of those games where going for the win has to be timed correctly because the act of doing so is harmful. In this case, the victory points clog up your deck.

I've played three times, but each time I'm teaching it, so we're playing the intro 10 cards each time, which don't really grab me. I will have to play this one day with a random setup to get a better feel.

When we first got it this game just kept coming out again and again - start and end of evening, anytime we needed to kill 10 minutes, or even just when we fancy a game!  I played it more in the first month of owning it than any other game I had done before then.  Of course since then, deckbuilders are everywhere, and although it's still one of my favourites, it has many more similar games to compete with now, so doesn't get nearly as much play.

RATING: 9
Fura kettősség munkál a játékkal kapcsolatban bennem. Tisztában vagyok vele, hogy korszakalkotó alkotás, ugyanakkor több hibája mellett nem tudok elmenni szó nélkül.
Igaz, hogy helyenként pasziánsz jelleget tud ölteni a játékmenet, hiszen viszonylag kevés az interakció. Remélem ezen pl. az Intrika jelentőset változtat.
Nagyon jó, hogy a saját paklinkat építgetjük, és, hogy nem kell agyégető, játékon átívelő stratégiákat felépítenünk. Maga a kombózgatás bejön, de már pár játék után túlságosnak sablonosnak érzem (lehet, hogy tévedek, és tudom szerezzem be a kiegeket stb.).
Eléggé érzem az egészben, hogy kitaláltak egy merőben új mechanikát, és nem igazán sikerült felöltöztetni a dolgot. Gyakorlatilag a grafika és a "történet" nekem semmi pluszt nem ad hozzá.
A megvalósítás minősége (az ár függvényében különösen) sem nyűgöz le. Nem tudom, ennyi pénzért miért nem lehet műanyag kártyákat tenni a dobozba (főleg olyat, aminek mondjuk nem fekete a pereme).

Very good game. I don't really see what all the hype about it is. Its easy to teach and fast to play, which is nice. It has a weakness in lack of player interaction, which is an odd complaint from me because I usually don't care. But when another player can be across the room and just have me tell them what is in their hand and call out what they want to do, I have to wonder.

Excellent hand management (not a big hand, 'cause you only manage a hand of five), strong balancing and quick-play make it very popular amoung our circle. The key is to keep the balance between actions, money and points. However, money-heavy strategy seems to be stronger. Whatever deck it appears, buying money usually secures you a solid place. Expansions are necessary to help balancing the game and to enhance replayability. By the way, any idea to speed up the game setup?

When I first got Dominion, I was OBSESSED to say in the least. Countless all-nighters just saying "one more game" until we fell asleep while playing.

Dominion is an important game as it defined and popularized a whole new genre but some of the mechanics are already dated.

Amazing game that started the whole deck-building concept.  Can't really add anything that hasn't been said by others, but could play this game everyday and be happy.  One thing I do appreciate is that this game is actually fairly easy to teach to non-gamers and have them be competitive in only a few plays.  Addictive!

I've only played this twice, and greatly enjoyed it both times.  Scratches the M:tG itch, plays quickly, and appeals to my irrational love of efficiency engines (c.f. Pillars of the Earth).  It also plays at a nice, quick pace.  Main con: not enough player interaction, though -- I was interested in what other players were doing on an intellectual level, but not because it was having any significant effect on my own play.

Addendum:  I've now played several more games, and think more highly of it.  There are enough player-interaction cards to make it more than multiplayer solitaire.  And even without them, I've come to think of this more like the board-game version of a running race.  Even if I can't affect the other runners, I still feel like I'm meaningfully competing against them.

Light game that's tons of fun to play, and easy to learn. However, there is a lot of shuffling involved and sometimes when playing with four people it gets a little harrying trying to wait for your turn. There's also not a whole lot of player interaction save for attack cards, but most of it is indirect.

BSW Version is rated an 7 due to the fast speed of play.  However, the real version adds a fair amount of time for shuffling, sorting, etc. and thus I only rate it a 6.  It's a good game and there was definitely an addictive quality for the first few games but it faded fairly quickly for me.

Simply ingenious new type of card game with deck construction aspect. At first it's a bit hard to get around the whole idea but very quickly the game flows very well. Also the game plays quickly and is quite good with any number of players (2-4). The only thing really lacking is interaction (only attack cards bring this to the game). This game will have many expansions coming. Look out for 'interactive' expansion soon in a FLGS near you :-)

RATING: 7
A nice card game that gains plus points from its simplicity. I've played a few games online and I don't think this is the best way to do it. I see it as more something which people can do in order to get together, drink a few beers and have a chat over, rather than as an intense gaming experience. 

UPDATE: I've dropped by rating from a 7 to a 6 as more than half of my games seem to be decided about half-way through and the rest of the game seems to be just waiting to show that I or the other player has won. This is a tad dull. A few games go right down to the line--and when they do this is really quite fun--but really this is the minority. Still, when I get to play face to face again, maybe I'll put my rating back up.

UPDATE 2: Had a chance to play a little more face to face, but it just dragged on and on.... I still always felt that it was clear who had won half way through the game.

UPDATE 3: Played Dominion with my family over Christmas: it is like Settlers in that it is very easy to introduce to non-gamers and, in my experience at least, it has an equally positive response among them. Its advantage over Settlers, however, is that there is more variability, and with the addition of new expansions, more complexity. As a result, you can smoothly move your opponents on to a deeper game once they have become familiar with the basic game. In many ways, this is a game that is a lot about the people you are playing with, and how fun it is will often depend on your relationship with them. I'm putting my rating back up to 7.

You have to buy your cards to compose your deck, but not just it, you must build your deck in a way to benefit your game flow, the way you buy victory points and other cards to help you reach a nice result.

I'm pretty much giving this a 9 for its *unique* CCG mechanics. Not only is drafting part of the game, but this is one of the few CCG's that doesn't use that tired over-copied, "rotate resource card to bring out other cards into play" mechanic. The additional point comes from this game being accessible to Eurogamers, Ameritrash gamers, and new players. This won't be the game that sits in your tote bag when you bring it to the game club! As a con, like other CCGs, exploring the card interactions is an important part of enjoying the game, so don't think you won't continue buying expansions. The expansions, however, are relatively inexpensive compared to Magic the Gethering and other CCGs, $35 per expansion per year online, less than a box of Magic cards.

***

[q="allenj82"]Please tell me if I am missing some grand strategy to this game, I really love the overall concept, but to me the game doesn't feel very different each time I play because you are always going for the province cards to end the game.[/q]

One "problem" about Dominion are the releases. The base set is just as much an introductory set. When no one played Dominion, this was a good idea -- a "good" game that's difficult to learn won't survive the market. (Arguably, this is why hobby boardgames will never make it beyond a small niche of players.)

However, only playing the simpler cards not surprisingly limits the variety of gameplay you can have with the game system, and that's what you're encountering. (This is not a hard and fast rule for all boardgames, as many Eurogamers will attest!) IMO, As a sweeping generality, the first sets (base, Intrigue, Seaside) can be won with the Big Money strategy, particularly the base set. It's not until Alchemy that Big Money is no longer a reliable default strategy. Prosperity will add a new Victory Point card (and Treasure card), which should further shake things up a bit.

So the new "problem" about Dominion is finding the expansions that best fit your play style. Some players do not like Big Money. Some players do not like "nasty" cards. Some players want a fast game. Some players want to make more decisions when playing a card. The Dominion expansions, IMO, require more research and work to make the right buying decision than other expansion sets from other games. While most expansions "patch" a game or add more options to the core game, the Dominion sets do neither. The Dominion sets merely have different varieties and complexities, which a certain CCG will tell you is a viable way to sell a game. In any case, you, as the consumer, certainly don't want to buy one expansion, only to find out you should have bought another. 

***


If you haven't played CCG's:
* Dominion
* Prosperity or Seaside
* Intrigue

If you have played CCG's
* Intrigue
* Prosperity or Seaside or Alchemy
* Dominion

Now start reading the reviews and looking for differences. Unlike Magic, each Dominion set has its own play style. As a CCG'er, you should be able to handle the complexity of Intrigue without playing the base game.

***

* Go bug a CCG'er how to shuffle with sleeves. I *far* prefer dealing the deck into two piles then sliding them together, than standard shuffling. But dealing the cards into three piles then a haphazard shuffle will do just fine.

* Yep, the Treasure and Victory Point cards *will* wear out faster. But you will have a second set with Intrigue, and you have to play the game quite a bit before you see wear. Still, I *have* seen worn cards at a game convention and do *not* want my cards in that condition.

* Your box can store sleeved cards, but not in the insert. Myself, I put each set of Kingdom cards in a baggie then pull out ten baggies randomly. This is *much* faster than using the Dominion randomizer cards then fishing for Kingdom cards. But not faster than using the iPod Dominion randomizer.

* You can use cheap penny sleeves, though not the cheapest ones. 

* Sleeves are not perfect. They will not prevent idiots from bending cards, and will not protect spills at the "top" of the sleeve. They will protect against idiots who insist on killing cards with a "90 degree bend" shuffle. So if you plan to play the game with strangers, you'll want to sleeve the cards.

* If the cards get worn, so what? Support the industry and buy another copy at the usual online discount. Heck, I've even seen copies at Borders, and Borders has 33% to 50% off coupons. Give the worn copy to a friend who's going off to college.

RATING: 5
One of the most over rated games om BGG according to me. Easy to learn, but too repetitive and too much down time between players. There are better games with similar mechanic (like Star Realms). A big downer is the victory point system where the most valuable victory point card you can by also determines when the game ends. This entails that the game always ends in an unsatisfactory way. Buy other games instead.

RATING: 6
In it's most basic form, Dominion is a game of great promise. The central mechanic of deck-building is pretty brilliant, and I love the quick game-play and the ream of decisions that seem simple, but end up making a big impact by the end. The abstractness is a problem, but I can get past it. Less easy to get past is the repetitive nature of the game. Cards feel very similar to each other, and most of them are very basic in their function. Not only that, but about 3 or 4 key strategies emerge and are hammered into the ground by the game.

It's pretty clear that this game is meant to be expanded. Because of that, the base game is in a strange position. It's the weakest of the sets so far, but it's also essential to anyone who wants to get into the game. For neophytes, buy the base game, then pick up one of the big expansions after about 100 games. That should give as much variety as any normal person needs.

*edit* I never play Dominion anymore, but it sits on the shelf, since I've invested too much in sets and sleeves to get rid of it. Still a decent game, but I'm sort of over it.

I often have a feeling that this is the best game.  It doesn't seem particularly grand in any way, other than perhaps the sheer number of cards and resulting possible boards.  What it is is a game that is mechanically perfect... not in the sense of "the most ideal game imaginable; the pinnacle of all possible games", but rather in the flawlessness with which the game runs, the beauty with which new cards can be introduced and imagined and fit perfectly into this masterpiece of design.  It's the power of a simple, robust foundation; it feels as though nothing could damage this game so long as it follows the rules set out in the beginning, as though the game is immune to ambiguity so long as its few straightforward conventions are upheld.

I'm not sure why I don't rate this game a 10.  I think I am imagining that there is some game that is perfect in that first sense, the true pinnacle, the objectively ideal game, and I am reserving the 10 for that game.  Also, the game doesn't blow my mind or create bombastic experiences like some epic 6-hour game, and I have a (probably flawed) notion that a game with a true perfect score should somehow do "everything"... but this game is, I think, flawless within reason, and playable by everyone while taking hundreds or thousands of games to master.

This game is SO much fun.  I highly recommend downloading an app to randomly select the decks for you, as it really is the most fun I've had playing the game, rather than picking good deck combos myself.

It's a great game that challenges you to come up with strategies on the fly.  Rather than studying for hours trying to come up with the best combinations, a random selection gives you a situation that you must react to.  It's all great fun, no matter how many players you have.

Update 1/1/2014: This game seriously fizzled for me.  The lack of player interaction and the fact that games always boil down to "Find a way to buy as many provinces as possible as quickly as possible" really got boring.  I still appreciate that every game is a bit different because the "engine parts" you have at your disposal are always different, but for me it just isn't interesting any more.  I probably haven't played it in about 6 months.  Will be trading it away as soon as I can.

Not a big deckbuilding fan - I like my randomness at the beginning of the engine-building process. The game feels a little entropic, too - your system, no matter how well-built, is subject to increasing randomness as your deck fills with cards. Of course, that leads to my favorite deck-building strategy - trashing everything that isn't completely awesome. Copper, estates, everything. So the best part of the game is...cleaning, I guess? Meh.

An archetype of deck building games. Can pack cards and makes for easy travel. The variety of cards allows for many types of strategies with many different feels of gameplay.

My only complaint would be that in a 2 player game focussing almost exclusively on gold and then victory cards is a dominating strategy that is tough to rival despite the best attack or actions cards. But that's a small complaint

Célunk olyan kiegyensúlyozott pakli építése újabb és újabb lapok hozzáadásával, ami gyorsan pörög és eközben tempóelőnyt ad nekünk, valamint "elbírja" a győzelmi pont kártyákat, ugyanis bár a játékban ezek semmit se érnek, a végén csak ezek határozzák meg a győztes kilétét.
Három féle kártyád van: akciólap, pénz, és győzelmi pont. Minden kört öt lappal kezdesz, majd végrehajthatsz egy akciót és várásolhatsz egy lapot a kezedben lévő pénzen. A lényeg persze az akciók kombinálása, mert azok újabb akciókat, laphúzást, plusz pénzt és vásárlást jelnethetnek. Nem mellékesen a már nem kellő lapokat érdemes egy-egy akcióval kitenni, ami által "sűrűbb" lesz a pakli és nem minden 4 rossz kézre jut egy jó, hanem akár fordítva.

I love the idea of a deck building card game where all players are on a level playing field.  It takes out the element of getting smashed by someone who spent five hundred dollars just buying up rare cards. The variety available is awesome as well.  If there is one particular card that your friend group that you play with doesn't like or considers to unbalance the game, you can just take it out.  Bored with the set you've been playing?  Just switch out a few more cards and you have a whole different game!  Not to mention the many expansions available to add any  number of other themes to plan around.  My only complaint is that there is not a lot of interaction between decks.  Nonetheless the game is still very enjoyable.  I highly recommend checking it out if you haven't already.

Usually I don't mind multi-player solitaire games, but this one feels more so than others I've played.  At least in Race for the Galaxy it feels like a race towards victory points, but because everyone has access to all the same cards and that you draw from your own deck there's no feeling of a race.  It really is just a deck building game, and while intellectually sounds interesting, the actual game play does not have enough fun for me.  12-20-2008 only two plays so far - rated 6.  We'll see what happens with more plays.

I can't decide what I think of this game. Sometimes I love it. Sometimes it's waaay too dry. This game is more interesting with 3 than it is with 2.

Constant shuffling is a joy to some, but it's not really my cup of tea. Still, a VERY simple game in terms of mechanics, and there is some depth to it. I think I've still got a lot to learn.

The base game is a good deckbuilder; I can't speak to the expansions.  I simply enjoyed Trains and Trains: Rising Sun much more.  The board really does add a lot and I appreciate the stronger connection to theme that Trains provides.  Dominion just felt too much of an abstract excercise.

I played this a year after it came out and didn't really give it a chance. I traded for this after playing and liking the ios version of Acenscion. Because of Acenscion I thought I would give deck building another chance. I have already played about 50 games of Dominion in about 3 weeks. It is my favorite game. It plays quick, changing card setups introduces new strategies, and my wife loves it too!

I'll admit that I just can't handle the lack of theme in this one and the (what I think is) boring artwork.

Slightly disappointed by the weakness of theme - some of the cards make very little sense. This aside, the cards in the base game at least lack major variety for me. 

The cards seem to be different re-writings of the same basic effects, with only minor differences between them. The expansions seem to rectify this, but I'll not be buying most of them unless they really show a marked improvement.

Enjoyable, yes, but not my favorite by far.

RATING: 8
This is a card-driven game of economy.  Each player begins the game with the same deck of cards, and has the same option of cards to buy to add to their deck.  There are 4 kind of victory point cards (-1, 1, 3, 6), 3 currency cards, and 10 cards with varying actions.  On your turn you may play an action card from your hand, then buy a card with what currency you have in your hand, then discard your hand and re-draw.  At the end of the game the player with the most victory points wins.

The game's strategic strength is in deciding how much of which cards to buy.  The game has a built-in pacing mechanic: the game ends when any 3 stacks of cards is empty.  There are 25 different action cards in the game, and only 10 are used at a time giving it plenty of replay value, and the combination that comes out each time causes players to evaluate their strategy each game.

I fail to see what everybody is so excited about. Rather simple choices overall, a single dominant strategy, not much interaction unless specific cards are drawn during set up. And I even don't mind shuffling. Doesn't hold a candle to collectible card games (of which I'm not a fan either).  Maybe it's because you don't see where you made a mistake? Not really a rewarding experience.

I understand the historical importance of Dominion in the boardgaming world in regards to introducing deck building mechanics, however I find the game to be fairly bland due to it's minimal theme, and many other deckbuilders have expanded upon the mechanic and have been significantly more fun to play.

3 Plays yet... and its very very nice. Best of it: It needs max. 10 minutes to learn (even for "non-players") and you can start, getting the details during the play. And although everyone is playing for himself and there is nearly no interaction ... you talk the whole time. You show your mates, how you played your cards so no one can call you a cheater, discuss certain cards and their powers... very well done. I´ve heard, that the designer has already 6 expantions finished. Lets hope, there will be no "Magic" or "Carcassonne" effect

A great game that uses the deck-building strategy of CCG's like of Magic: the Gathering as the actual game mechanic itself.  Players try to build a deck of cards that make you build a better deck.  Land cards are VPs and do nothing more than take up space and contribute to winning.  The game is easily taught and liked by both gamers and non-gamers alike with anywhere from 10-20 second turns.

The game, however, is a trick; it claims it is not a CCG, but as expansions are being churned out, one feels helpless to not purchase another.

Jan 2011 - My current favorite game.  For me it's perfect because even if I lose miserably I enjoy trying to pull off cool combos or frustrate other players.  A great game that plays quickly, is easy to introduce to new gamers, and offers virtually infinite replayability (to me).

Elegant and simple. You can really feel the vast playtesting time it has undergone. Amazing, Mr Vaccarino really is a great designer.  
We all know it's merit , so i just want to underline here the only flaw i think Dominion has. 
Every card game is obviously luck driven. While you can put all your effort to build a mathematic anti-luck deck you'll always have to shuffle it so you'll never be absolutely immune to absurd unlucky draws..  ATTACK cards exacerbate this. In a multiplayer game it is normal that an attack played by player X , completely destroy player Y strategy , and absolutely boost the rush to victory of player Z .  
I understand that interactions are the salt of every game but in my humble opinion  dominion's (and expansions also) interaction interfere too heavily and randomly on the game and it's overall enjoyment. Said this.. we are all free to play with the cards we like leaving aside the cards we don't, so it's not really a problem.

Kapsz egy pakli kártyát, véletlenszerűen kihúzzátok, hogy melyik speciális lapok vesznek részt a játékban majd elindul a játék. A körödben a húzópaklidból felveszel 5 kártyát, ezekből próbálsz újabb lapokat megszerezni, majd a felhasznált és esetleg megszerzett lapokat egy saját dobópaklit alkotva eldobod. Ha elfogyott a húzópaklid, akkor a már megnövekedett dobópaklid megkevered és egy új húzópaklit alkotsz belőle. Szép lassan megduzzad a paklid, egyre több dolgot tudsz megcsinálni a megszerzett kártyákkal. Óvatosan válaszd ki az új kártyákat, mert ha az elején túl sok győzelmi pont kártyát spájzolsz be, akkor azok visszafoghatnak hiszen játék közben a kezedben semmilyen akcióra nem lehet beváltani.

Well what do you know... Another game that's totally deserving of the hype it's received. 

This game is a lot of fun. The four of us wanted to immediately play again--something that rarely happens. So many cool mechanisms. And your strategy completely changes based on what's out--the Bureaucrat might suck in this game thanks to the Thief, but it's awesome in another game.

It's the best game I doubt I'll ever own. My family would never play this, and there are approximately 245 copies in our group.  So I'm good.

Dominion really surprised me.  I wasn't expecting to enjoy it as much as I do.  It moves a long so quickly that very often it's your turn again before you've finished shuffling your deck.  My gaming group keeps coming back to it even after months of playing, which for me, is the mark of an excellent game.  We usually take turns choosing cards to determine the 10 action cards to play with, so no two games have been the same.  What I find interesting is that the different combinations of cards as well as the different ways people will play will give each game a different feel.  I really love this game.

Dominion is a lot of fun as a family game.  It is easy to teach and learn, and plays quickly.  Yet, there are enough combinations to keep it interesting for adults.  My kids enjoy this, and I like having games to play with them that are interesting.  It is also a nice game to break out with non-gamers since the learning curve is so small.

I have been trying out some of the expansions.  I am surprised, but I prefer just the base game.  Prosperity extends the game a bit longer than feels right. It is ok mixing in some propsperity cards, but I really don't like the Colonies. Intrigue needs more plays but has not really wowed me yet.  I am not planning on getting any other expansions.

It has a very different mechanic to it, and has a CCG like feel without having to give WotC your paycheck every month. I'm a big fan of the deckbuilding mechanic. But, I dislike the ending. I feel like I'm playing mostly by myself, while watching how other people are doing, and the ending just feels very flat. Everyone looks around and says "well, I guess that's it." and counts up their points. There's not enough tension, I guess.

So, summary: Great mechanic, crappy end-game.  Also, wish for more player interaction.

A great game, easy to learn and jump into.  Played this recently for the first time at the FLGS game night and found that even with inexperienced players, the game moved quickly and we finished in about 1/2 hour.  

The rules are very straightforward - play an action, buy a card.  But the cards you choose to buy can allow you additional actions and buys.  From that you develop your strategy to accumulate the most victory points.

Although we played with just the basic, beginner deck it is easy to see the game has great potential for repeat plays as you have 25 decks to choose from.

As soon as the first game was done, we were ready for another.  In fact, after just two games the other players put in an order for their own copy.

Received at Oasis of Fun 2009 prize table.

This seems to be a less-interactive but less-annoying Magic:The Gathering. You build your deck as you play from a common set of cards. You win by having more victory points in your deck, but the kicker is that victory point cards don't do anything else but take up space in your hand. The game comes with 25 sets of rule-bending "kingdom cards" but you only play with 10 sets at a time, giving you lots of re-playability. This is an optimizing game: each combination of 10 probably has a best strategy regardless of your opponent strategies. This suggests that at a certain point folks will get bored. :) We'll see!

UPDATE Aug-2-2009: The girlfriend likes this one. She takes particular joy in action combos centered around the Village card.

UPDATE Jun-14-2010: Dropping to a 7.5, reflecting the fact that while Dominion is highly re-playable, the repetitiveness of the shuffling mechanic can wear on me. I like to play Dominion only after getting my game on in other ways first.

Comes close to cracking that Holy Grail of being accessible, fast-playing and yet still interesting.  The downside is that the "broken" strategy* undermines the fun, and the feeling that half the game is still missing.  But a great gateway game nevertheless,a dn perhaps an easier route into this sort of game than PR - San Juan is.

*yes, I know it isn't "broken" per se, but it is close enough.

I bought this game in the hopes it would become the filler of choice among the groups I game with the most.  It easily met and exceeded that expectation, proving a hit with numerous friends I introduced it to.  The base game strategies eventually got a little monotonous (in that they mostly converge on a race into Provinces), but it had still seen a ton of play by that point and I still strongly recommend new players start out with the base game before adding expansions.

Players were amazed that I had never played this before today 12Nov2011. I was put off by the multiple decks of cards that reminded me of Magic- the Gathering which I detest.
However, once introudced I quite enjoyed the experience. Not as great as some people seem to think.

What's left to say?  Ingeniously combines the deckbuilding and deckplaying phases of CCGs, but subject to the same limitations (development of powerdecks leads to a certain sameness).  Haven't gotten tired of it yet.

RATING: 3
Dominion is a dry, boring exercise in analyzing the best way to get more money faster with virtually no tactical play or player interaction, uninteresting engine building, and few interesting trade offs. The victory conditions are unsatisfying, the strategies are too similar, and the card abilities tend to be bland. Money is the be all and end all of the game 95+% of the time. 

I enjoyed Dominion when I first played it, but the more I've played it, the more problems I've had with it. At this point I'd go so far as to say it's a poorly designed game with less strategy and replayability than it's proponents claim.

I much prefer Ascension, Eminent Domain, Core Worlds, Friday, Mage Knight, and Puzzle Strike. Puzzle Strike does everything right where Dominion does it wrong, and it fixed every problem I had with Dominion.

RATING: 4
I acknowledge Dominion as the game that started the deck-building genre and it serves its place in board game history for that. It's an excellent base standard model for the deck-building mechanics which really is a brilliant in-game concept. 

The mechanics of Dominion plays solidly, but that's all there is to Dominion. There really is no game apart from continually shuffling and building your deck. I'd rather spend my time deck-building and shuffling a deck I can actually use as part of a larger game. But the simplicity of the game and light theme also makes it a very approachable gateway game to introduce to casual and non-gamers.

I've only played the base game which is what this rating reflects. I hear expansions add more depth to the game, so Dominions: Intrigue or additional expansions should be considered if you want to get into this game.

So far I like it better with 2 players - much like RftG and M:tG.

Also, I didn't realize how fiddly it is to have to deal with all those decks of cards. During the game it's not so bad, but setup and cleanup is pretty annoying for a 'quick card game'. I suspect this is much better on BSW where the computer does all that, as well as shuffling your 5 card deck for you.

After having avoided this game for a few years, I was amazed at how much I liked it after just one play. The second game introduced the aspect of variation due to the deck selection, and by the third game I understood the competing impulses of wanting to try another round with the same cards, now understood, and wanting to see how a different deck selection will turn out.

As a benefit to new players, the game never induces a sense of any player doing poorly, until measured against the progress made by his competitors. The game allows a gratifying learning experience before requiring a focus on competition.

Given the design pedigree, I decided to buy Puzzle Strike.

Love the concept and mechanics. Cards are fun and varied. Theme feels tacked on, but who really cares?

Few problems though. Many cards are useless/never bought, shuffling every 2 seconds, and a lot of downtime for a fast paced game. (Ever had to wait for 3 people's turns just to buy 1 card without any actions?)

Many of these problems are fixed with BSW, and in fact I kind of like playing on there more.

8 rating after one play. Can't wait to play again. Very fun and wondering if you need 40% treasure like 40% land in a Magic deck. Going to take me a while to make my deck building efficient. The first game I was just like ... not getting enough money ... guess I need to buy more. I was reactive and am betting pro-active is more efficient and gives me a better chance of winning. Intrigue expansion has been ordered from CSI. Which of course means I needed to get to 100$ for free shipping so sleeves for Agricola and Stone Age ordered, new Smallworld expansion and promos ordered, a Resistance expansion ordered ... Yay, I leveled up! Now level 7 and 3% off every purchase. They have me so hooked! Bastages!

RATING: 4
2-4 player filler-length game, that is a good embodiment of Euro design principles, so it's suitable to introduce to curious players.

It's okay. Original design, and does barely scratch the CCG itch, but gameplay is zzz dry. You barely have to care what other people are doing. The only player interaction is whether they'll end the race, and all player interaction through cards is forced. Decisions are almost completely automatic after you decide what to do at the start of the game, and everything that comes after is luck of the card draw and zzz. You just decide what to do at the start of the game, and then you become the shuffle bitch of the God of card draws and make decisions that make you feel good, but really are just automatic. At least it plays quickly enough, that it's an option for short games.

Game balance is a problem. Nearly every setup involving a Chapel only contains a single dominant strategy. The turn order is completely broken: letting players with fewer turns win the tiebreaker in no way justifies the advantage of going first and the potential to get more turns (the tiebreaker is moot, because any good start player can ensure ties are rare). 

People rave about the variability of game setups, but realistically, you get a handle on every single strategy there is after about 20-25 plays. That is way less than most other board games out there. In other board games, the way people behave differently can add almost unlimited replayability to a game, so the forced interaction in Dominion (plus obvious dominant strategies like Chapel) really hurts in this regard. In this game more so than others, sticking to a few well-learned rule-of-thumbs can guarantee victory without breaking a sweat at all (while you will get countered in other games if you always do the same thing). The learning curve is sloped gently, but very, very shallow, and once you reach its top, it's all luck.

You know a game defines mediocrity when the online implementation is actually more enjoyable than playing in real life, and when it needs cards upon expansion cards to add variability to a game that inherently has none.

Good original idea, but a work in progress.

By the way, seems like Dominion has the biggest contingent of passionate/hardcore fans, the kind who go "OMG?! YOU DON'T LIKE THIS GAME! NOZZZ WTF IS WRONG WIF YOU. YOU DON'T GET IT."

One of my favorite games as well as a favorite among several in my gaming groups. Used to get played more frequently than it had.

I would rather eat my own pancreas than play this MTG rip-off.  The theme sounds cool, but is poorly implemented.  I don't feel like I'm building anything, except my tolerance for pain.  I'd rather play a really long game of Give Me a Bunch of Paper Cuts on My Eye and Pour Lemon Juice All Over My Face.

Ok,ok.  I'm going to try to give this game another chance.  I think the fact that I was still new in the gaming hobby may have colored my opinion of this.  I've upped my rating, but I still find some of the endless combos annoying and highly reminiscent of the things I disliked about Magic.  The downtime while someone is playing out their entire deck each hand is totally a drag.  I give it a 5 and that's the end of it.  One last thing - Dominion can't carry Ascension's jockstrap.

So, I've tried it yet again, and whaddya know?  I get it now.  The uber-combos still bug me, but I now enjoy it.

And now, not only do I enjoy it, but I love it.  Ridiculous, I know.

This was game that really surprised me.  When it was initially released, I was not all that interested in the game.  It just didn't sound like something I would be interested in.  In fact, I didn't even plan on giving it a single play just to try it out.

Then I actually played the game and was immediately hooked.  I am not sure what it is about the game, but I find that I want to play it over and over again.  Granted, I don't have the massive number of plays that some out there have, but what I have played is a lot for me on a single game.  

I am still not all that sure what it is that I find inticing about the game.  I suppose has a little to do with the deck-building aspects of the game.  I imagine that it is the efficiency aspects that really appeal to me.  That and playing with cards, and exploring the decision space.  Well, I'm still not sure.

Still, I am happy to have the game and now am looking forward to the expansions as well. [04/07/2009] 8

my wife and I are having fun with this one. The core mechanic is easy to understand, and the feel of the game evolves as you play and you deck starts to work for you. We switched out some of the cards for our last game, and it did give things a very different feel, so I think it has decent replayability value. It's fun to see your combos go off and plunge through a huge number of cards in one turn. Despite there being a few cards that affect the other players' game, it is basically a race between players who are each involved in building and running their own decks. It might be a good way to introduce people to CCGs and some of their basic concepts.

Tried it online. Didn't get it. 
4 years later - borrowed a copy, didn't get it. 
Tried Thunderstone - that one I did get. 

Problem: theme has no function whatsoever - it could for instance help you grasp the counterintuitive gameplay and card interaction (like this was accomplished in Thunderstone). I realised I just can't be bothered to play themeless games and here it's also the learning curve - I'm guessing that one must invest into a game to learn to see the subtle connection between cards, but I just don't see any reward in doing this. I play a card to play another card which lets me draw another card so I can play another card - you must be joking. Also the "auto pilot" style of playing makes no sense multiplayer (you make decisions automatically, mostly before the game). It actually lacks tactical decision process. Additional attacking (intrigue) doesn't save the game, but only hinders it - for me adding take-that elements onto a MPS is never really welcome, I want the game to be either richly interactive or solitaire (but only IF it has a theme).

Juegazo de cartas. Muy adictivo y rejugable.
Muchas variables posibles gracias a las 25 cartas diferentes que tiene (en cada partida, se usan 10) y a como interactuan entre sí. Nunca 2 partidas son iguales.
Desde Magic, que nunca me había viciado tanto a un juego de cartas. La ventaja de este, es que no tienes que estar comprando cartas cada dos por tres. Aparte que pueden jugar de 2 a 4 personas sin perder ni un ápice de diversión.

P.D: En las partidas jugadas solo apunto las que juego con el juego físico. En la BSW tengo mas de 70 partidas.

Añadidos el Dominion Intriga, Terramar y Alquimia. Todas las partidas que haré a partir de esa fecha, serán con las cartas mezcladas de todos los dominion y las apuntaré en el juego original.

I think I have still only scratched the surface of this game. Mainly we have played with the recommended starting set with just minor changes. For me the game feels best with 3 players, unfortunately that is the least common number of players for my gaming.
2010-10-17 The game finally sees some table time as my children (7 & 9 now) learned to play. Today we had a heavy attack game where I was defeated by them for the first time, my daughter defeated my son by 2 points and me by 3 points. Unfortunately, I've discovered that most of the time the game doesn't provide many fun decisions to be done, you usually set the plan based on the available cards and sometimes just tweak it a bit due to the situation.

The granddaddy of deck-builders. Dominion is deck-building at its purest - simple, streamlined and with a painfully boring theme. As the cards are largely vanilla, the majority of decisions can be made on autopilot. The attack cards also seem like an artifical way to force player interaction.

This appeals to the little kid in me that collected Pokemon cards, but hated the feeling of opening a booster pack full of energy cards. I LOVE the game, but this never makes it to the table since it isn't really a hit in my friend group. 
Edit: This has been getting a lot more plays recently, which is terrific.  The base set has lost some of its appeal, as I much prefer the Seaside, Dark Ages, and Prosperity cards.

Rating reflects all the expansions I own as well, which I rank in the following order:

3. Prosperity (big money is always fun)

Great game in all aspects.  Skill is necessary to build a deck that relies the least on chance.  With only 10 kingdom cards in play each game is different in the strategy necessary.  The player who builds the best deck will win in almost every occasion.  This game is great for only 2 players and also for 4.  It's also quick and easy to set up.

Myriads of choices and replayability allow different, well-balanced strategies. This is a game of pure "enginge-building" - no theme appearent. But it does not need a theme to be intriguing.
However, it can turn out to be a excersize of shuffling and waiting on your turn when playing with 4 players.
I also feel that some cards from expansions unnecesarily lenghten gameplay and make it too fiddly. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
[126 plays] Boy this is fun! If I get sick of this after 500 games, I don't care, because those first 499 games will have been worth the ride.

I like efficiency/economic games, and this is a clever little beast which plays quite quickly after you have a couple of games under your belt. Building your deck and getting your engine running, then converting from money to victory points at the right time reminds me of St. Pete and San Juan to some degree, but the gameplay is unique and fascinating. Some deck combinations will have more interaction, while others may have little, but you always will need to watch what other players are doing and how fast the clock is ticking.

The cards are nicely made, the artwork is pleasant, and the infinite combinations will last a long time before anyone truly needs the inevitable expansion decks. I am very pleased to own this new classic.

#13 on my Top 100 Games of All Time (2015)

Dominion was my first experience with deck-building, and it's still one of my favorites. I own each one of the expansions and most of the promos. I keep them all together in the Hobby Lobby wooden artists case. I admit that I don't play this one as much as I used to, but I still think highly of it and would not turn down an invitation to play. I've only played less due to my exposure to more and more amazing games- I'm a card carrying member of Cult of the New. Dominion is a classic- it's easy to learn, but a bit harder to play well. My favorite expansion is Prosperity cause I love big money!

RATING: 9
Right. I like it.

It scratches the MtG itch, it's easier to teach and get started than RftG and it plays in 30-45 minutes.

Players start off with 10 cards and slowly use that to buy more cards in order to create a deck (engine) to generate money to buy VP cards. The 25 different cards offers much variability and strategy.

It's almost like reverse-MtG where players have access to a pool of common cards and are drafting the best decks. The 'mana' problem is fixed by having common money for everything.

Neat game that offers much replayability. Can't wait for expansions.

Best game for me to play with non-gamers. My big gripe with it however is the lack of interaction between players; if you don't have any "attack" cards its like playing solitare at a table with other people, trying to be the first to finish.  Perhaps I'm just spoiled by games like Game of Thrones, which is full of bickering, alliances, backstabbing, and second-guessing...

Will always hold a special place in my heart as our gateway board game. The deck building is done almost perfectly in that you always have difficult decisions on what cards you want to buy because you don't want to start clogging your deck with victory cards too early, but you also can't afford to fall too far behind in the province race. After getting the game set up a two player game can be done in twenty minutes, and even when a person loses they can feel good knowing that it was just because the other person managed to build a slightly more efficient engine.

I've only played this a couple of times, and (I think) with the base game. There were a few combination cards - are those expansion cards?

RATING: 6
The granddaddy of deck builders, Dominon has waned in popularity in our group in the face of more meaty deck builders like Core Worlds, Barbarossa, and Trains. 

The barely-there theme also fails to maintain interest in the simple deck building mechanics.  Deeper theme (Barbarossa) or tweaked mechanics (Trains, Core Worlds) are needed to keep my interest. 

When new, deck building alone was enough to sustain my interest in this game, but now, I find myself wanting to do more with the combos I build than just buy more cards.

This is a fun, fast-paced, accessible game with a great deal of replay-ability.  The game is basically dynamic deck-building.  Although my least favorite aspect of collectible card games is deck-building, this game turns it into an exciting and rewarding process.  Fun for new players and addictive for the experienced.  Also, great value for money -- over 500 cards in the base set.  Definitely print out the storage label from BGG, it saves a great deal of setup/cleanup time.

With more than 3 players it's boooooooring. Also I've overplayed it a little, but it's a good game nontheless.

Rating this an "8" based on what's in the basic game box alone, not on Dominion as a whole. Even Donald X. seems to have admitted the game is somewhat incomplete with only the original 25 cards. I'd recommend anyone who plays this and says "It's good, but..." to try Seaside or Intrigue. Dominion becomes a more complete game with each expansion you add, I've found. The downside is that it can be deceptively expensive as you scoop up more expansions.

An OK game, but seemed to go on longer than required.  A lot of it is luck, even if it's your own luck.

Works much better once people know the cards and it's run without much faffing.

One has to like Dominion. The variation that the different cards give keeps the game fresh for a long, long time. The rules are easy to learn and fundamentally very simple, yet elegant. Some expansions can make Dominion more complicated and/or cumbersome though.

A really good idea was the way in which victory points hamper your deck, but are the only way to win the game. One thing I quite dislike is the possibility for the "village idiot" -strategy. Man that gets old quick.

Dominion grabbed my attention from the very first time I played it. It was the first deck building game I had played and the idea of starting with 10 cards and building my way up to a full deck fascinated me. My only complaint would be that some cards seem so much better than others, making the others almost obsolete.

I didn't think a card-driven game could be much fun, but this is a brilliant design.  You're still at the mercy of your shuffle, but you can make a lot of helpful decisions.  The game plays very quickly, but beware of opponents who whirl through their turn to keep you from noticing what they are buying.

Play this all the time, although it is not actually my favourite.  What it does do very well is to "work" in numerous scenarios - eg 2, 3 or 4 players; regular gamers but also liked by non-gamers; played seriously or played casually with the TV on in the background.  Playing time (say 20 mins average per game) also increases the replay value.

[BGCOLOR=#FFFF00][COLOR=#000000]Family.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] 2-4p, 30m.

Card. Picked up at BGGcon on description and advanced buzz. Fantastic game - my entire group likes it quite a bit. It scratches a lot of itches, yet is mechanically simple. Mixing up the kingdom cards refreshes the feel of the game. Virtually nonexistent downtime in a 15-30 minute game that is just pure fun to play.

Update: passing 25 plays now, I've upgraded this to a full 10. I just really enjoy this game and doubt this will ever change. The forthcoming addition of new cards, and the ability to make up your own cards for kicks, will likely keep this fresh for me for a long time, too. Awesome.

After many games of Dominion with different groups of people, it's become one of those games I'd play if a group wanted to, but don't feel like I need to own a copy of. It's a neat game. You are gradually building the deck with which you are playing the game. So as the composition of your deck changes, the gameplay changes. Dominion gives players extensive feedback as to how well they are playing, and I like this about the game. What I'm not so keen on is the pride of place given to efficiency. I don't not mean to compare Dominion to Race for the Galaxy, because in most ways they aren't comparable - but imagine if Race for the Galaxy only had a single method to ending the game (victory point depletion) and only a single winning condition (most victory points earned through consumption). If this were so, I wouldn't enjoy Race nearly so much because the game would have been reduced to efficiency at this single task. And that's how Dominion feels to me. Yes, every blend of cards lends itself to slightly different strategies. But the end is always the same. Tightest deck wins. I do think it is a pretty darn good game. It's just that whenever we're talking about what to play and Dominion comes up, the feeling is always "meh".

Dominion is a game consisting of nothing more than its core deckbuilding mechanic, with a pasted on theme. With a given set of Kingdom Cards, there always seems to be a dominant strategy, so you better play with random cards all the time. However, especially with the base set alone, this quickly became boring after only a couple of plays. Sold this as I now have Mage Knight, which is a much more engaging game with a similar deckbuilding mechanic.

Wife and I love it.  Get's better with expansions.  Hard for me to say how much life the base only has as we loved it so much that we started buying expansions relatively quickly.

Light and quick game, but reveals depth with time which is a great combo.  Just play someone online at isotropic that is rated >40 if you think this game is simple and you have it all figured out :)

Don't record plays unless they are played face to face.  Games on isotropic and androminion would probably total a few thousand.

With all expansions mixed in this game could maybe be a 10 for us probably.

Many deckbuilders have come, many deckbuilders have gone, and I still find myself coming back for some Dominion. While the newer games have gone for the less deliberate, more fun approach, Dominion is the staunch defender of the strategy approach to deckbuilding. 

Is this the right time to start buying VPs? Will putting this card in my deck make it run smoother or will it be the monkey wrench in the cogs of a well-oiled machine. These are the questions you will be asking yourself during each turn of Dominion. If you don't know the game well, this can end in many wasted turns and an overall aggravating experience. But if you learn to navigate the meanders of Dominion's strategy, you will get one of the most interesting games the deckbuilding mechanics has to offer.

Deserves the praise it gets for creating the genre. As time goes by the base game loses some of it's magic, and you'd have to suggest that newer games have trumped this original set. That isn't to say that with all the expansions around Dominion isn't still incredibly relevant, but if you had to recommend a single game without expansions I'd hesitate to say Dominion.

Which all makes it quite hard to rate. It is a beautiful design, and only because others have stood on its shoulders does it start to lose some of its glamour. Seven feels too little and eight means I'd have to give others a higher score. I'll go with seven.

BGG top játék, de valahogy nálam még mindig nincs meg a hatása. A sok kártyából adódó nagyon sokfajta, különböző játék lehet ennek a társasnak a sikere. De ha valaki a Race for the Galaxy-ra azt mondja, hogy unalmas pasziánsz, akkor vajon erről miért nem ugyanaz a véleménye? Mert számomra ez a játék az unalmas pasziánsz. Egy-egy leosztás esetében valahogy mindig úgy éreztem, hogy van egy nyerő stratégia és aki azt megtalálja az mindig nyeri ezt a fajta leosztást. Valószínűleg nincs így, de mégis számomra nagyon automatikus a játék. Nem igazán éreztem egyszer sem izgalmat a játék közben. Egyértelműen jobbnak találom többen játszani mint ketten, de még így sem tudok neki 6-nál több pontot adni.

Having been a card game fan for a long time, I got introduced to this game and was instantly hooked - it is so engaging and such a well designed system.. 

100% recommend this game + a couple of simple expansions + a few really good mates that enjoy board/card games; this game is by far the most played game of our group.

RATING: 9
So this game is super addicting and plays just great with 2-3 players. The learning curve and sometimes long turns make this not always play as well with 4+ players unless everyone kind of knows what they are doing. The rules were simple enough to also make this a pretty good "Gateway Game" to introduce people into the hobby game world with. I have noticed that currently a lot of the decks seem to be reoccurring because the set itself is pretty vanilla overall between cards. Picked up Seaside, which added a TON of depth to the game. Definitely made it more interesting. I also now have hinterlands and dark ages. It only gets better with each addition. This rating is for Dominion as a whole.

Excellent presentation and components. Rules are very easy to understand and to be taught to new players. The surprisingly simple mechanics provide fluent gameplay, while the nicely illustrated cards add atmosphere. Good balance between luck and strategy, so that even first time players can win the game (if not up against hardcore gamers, of course).
Only drawback: With only the core rules interaction between the players is lacking. Therefore adding one or more of the expansions is highly recommended.

Summary: One of my all time favourites!

Not enough player interaction, the card effects in the base game are too tame for my tastes, and almost zero tactical play. "Gameplay" basically consists of players testing their preset strategies against each other and seeing which one comes out on top. This is improved only slightly in expansions. Can still be a fun relaxing game to play though, but it feels more like a nice, satisfying stretch of my arms than an absorbing game. And still better than most of the copycats.

I use a reverse drafting system for setup using the blue random card setup deck.
1> Deal each player 6 of the blue cards
2> Randomly draw additional card(s) face up in the middle. 1 card for a 3 player game and 2 cards for a 4 player game.
3> Each player will look at the 6 cards and pick one to remove from the game then pass their remaining hand to the person to the left.
4> Repeat until each person has 3 cards remaining in a 3 player game or 2 cards remaining in a 4 player game.
5> Everyone reveals whats remaining and that should be the 10 card sets you should be using for the game.

Rating the complete Dominion with expansions: Excellent, near-infinite variation; tightly-balanced gameplay; non-direct but certainly relevant player interactions.  Everything I always wanted CCG games to be.  A gem of a game that will be remembered among the all-time classics.  (Update: still going strong in 2017.  New expansions continue to add depth with new mechanics such as Events and Landmarks that can totally change the game.  It's my all-time #1 game and nothing else comes close.)

THE deck builder. It plays quickly, is simple to understand, and offers tons of variability. The unfortunate side is that the theme is extremely bland so it's tough to get others into it without forcing them to experience the game first. More thematic, lesser deck builders are easier to get to the table.

This rating is after my first impression, first rating is a 8, but it has the potential to move up further to 9.5 or even 10.

This is a crack game.  The design is totally obsession making.  

I know that this is a strange comparison, but this has all the joy of trying to manage your deck in Paths of Glory in a fraction of the time.

I'm not too big on CCGs, but this is all about finding combos in a manageable system.  Sometimes you will just spin your wheels waiting for things to go your way, but in an engine game, getting behind can be devastating.

Update: Rating only going up...

Completely fresh gameplay really gives Dominion a boost.  Fans of deck-building CCGs will really find something comfortable here.  The repeated shuffling is problematic but unavoidable.

Dominion immediately comes across as a great game, but also exudes an enormous feeling of "flash-in-the-pan" success.  It feels like a game that you will play a lot for a week and then never touch again.  The counter for this, however, is the near infinite possiblity for expansion.

I love this game for many reasons, and hope to defend my high score here.  For one, I love deck building games.  For two, even non-gamers love this game.  For three, it isn't so serious that everyone around the table is concentrating to the point of ignoring everyone else and not talking amongst themselves.  Quite the opposite in fact.  You can hang out, have fun, and carry on conversations with people without interrupting the flow of the game.

Easy to learn, but hard to master.  Numerous card combination possibilities and personal strategies.  Very good game!

Now that I have played a LOT, I find that the game with just the base set has finally (after playing literally hundreds of times) gotten a bit stale.  This is no criticism of the game, in fact it's a testimonial to how good it is.  But I have reached the point where I need to throw in Intrigue for it to still be totally fun.  Intrigue, mind you; I haven't even begun to plumb the depths of enjoyment of the other expansions.

RATING: 5
Not the best game ever, but certainly the one I have played the most. It's extremely replayable, has just the right amount of luck, and I can fit at least two games into a lunch hour.

Dropped 10->8. Still a great game, but substitutes obnoxious "take that" mechanics for real interaction. Attacking other players not only hurts their score (which is fine), but also makes the game more boring by robbing them of meaningful decisions (which sucks). Loses a little steam every time I play it.

Hint for people looking to make another deck-building game: instead of tacking on chrome and lame new currency types (like Thunderstone), how about improving the interaction a bit? Think of some cards that will encourage players to work together for a while before stabbing each other in the back. I'm convinced that it can be done.

Dropped again to a 7. An average game with some nice advantages and irritating disadvantages. Certainly got my money's worth out of it, but I won't be pulling it out very often.

The plummet continues, after a long session of flipping curses and waiting ten minutes for my chance to flip a few more. This game can really suck. If everyone draws 4/3 at the start and buys a militia, I'd rather be playing Monopoly. It's really that boring.

This game is great for ex Magic: the gathering players that have become frustrated by WOTC because of how broken the game has become.

RATING: 5
Base game only

Good things first: I like the idea of building your deck while playing and I don't mind the shuffling at all. It's a fast game too, which I like.

The bad: I think the theme is pretty weak. I never feel like i'm building a dominion. How can a bunch of Smithy's, villages, thiefs and a lot of gold constitute the strongest dominion? And buying estates, dutches and Provinces never feels like buying land, but just VP's (besides, who wants to BUY land? I want to conquer it)

I know that most games can be boiled down to getting the most VP, but a good game (in my opinion) hides this simple fact behind a great theme and storytelling. Dominion, at this point, fails to do that. 

Also, there is almost no player interaction. Just a couple of cards in the entire base-set can directly affect you opponents hand or deck, but most of the time it doesn't matter what the other players do. You just have to watch what cards are bought. Very much a solitare game

Look, it's no secret that there's no real theme in here, and that's something I usually like. But I've found that in quick playing card games, I don't really care. This game is all about the combos and synergies (and possibly trying to counter others' plans). Although I know I'm not that good at this game, I still find the variable set up to be a real draw. And if you can't handle all of the shuffling, the nursing home's got your arthritis medication in the little paper cup. Gabe has.

I love the speed of the game (by the time you've cleaned-up your play area or shuffled your cards it's usually already your turn again) and I love the depth of the strategies you can find with different card combinations. Great card game that's worth every penny I paid for it.

Tremendous lot of fun with lots of variety in game play due to all the possible combinations of the various decks. Players need to have flexibility in thinking because the changing way the different game decks interact with each other may require quite different strategies to win each new game.

Once upon a time in the BGG forums I was told "not to listen when people water it down to a 'deck-building game'" and rather that Dominion is "really an amazing study in probability and risk-reward."

Garbage. Dominion is a game where you build a deck. You never actually get to play your deck - not in an interactive CCG sense, at least - but you have ample time to refine the snot out of it. Then the game is over.

I think it's a brilliant mechanic, but there's so much more that could've been done here. The theme, which begins and ends with some medieval-y artwork on the cards, is laughably blase and arguably nonexistant; there's nothing to disguise Dominion as anything other than a race for victory points. Moreover, there's almost no player interaction involved, and the few cards that affect other players' hands have a minimal net effect on the game. I simply can't see how people are catching the CCG vibe here as basically every CCG I've every played or read about involves sustained direct confrontation between players. Yeah, you build a deck. So what?

Come on, Dominion. You can do better than this!

not a big fan but online play dramatically improves the speed and feel of the game, especially by getting rid of the tedium of constant shuffling.  I'd give the online experience at least a 5, which makes it a viable game for me though far from my first choice.  7 Wonders and Race For The Galaxy (especially) feel far richer as card games.

If we are talking the Dominion base set on its own, it would get about a 7. It alone gets stale very quick, and the cards in it are not my favorites.

No fun with more than 2 or maybe 3 (if they are quick/experienced) people, though.

My biggest issue is that there's very little player interaction--an issue that could easily be fixed with an expansion that focused solely on battle cards.  There are cards that can "harm" other players, but there's no reason not to play them.  Some elements of risk need to be introduced into the system before it can truly be considered a great game.
UPDATE:  After 40 plays, I'll amend my comments to say that this is actually a great game, but that it could be improved by better attack dynamics.  I haven't played Intrigue or Seaside, but I look forward to checking them out.

+ Dominion : Intrigue
The Granddaddy of all deck-builders. I was also surprised by this one. Simple, and the "theme" (or lack-of) will please the casual gamers who are turned off by sci-fi, cyberpunk, superheroes and fantasy (Star Realms, Shadowrun Crossfire, Legendary Marvel and Pathfinder)

Quick and fun, but deceptively deep.  Seeing how the various cards work together is far more important that seeing what they do individually, and since the available combinations can change each game, the replay potential is huge.

I bought this looking for another quick filler game, something to play in 30 mins or less.  It's not, because you always wind up playing four games in a row.

Mayday Euro Game Card Sleeves should just ship standard with this game.  They make the shuffling a breeze.

Shuffle, shuffle and shuffle some more.
All the shuffling isn't worth playing the game, which consists of deciding what cards you want in your deck at the start of the game and then just going through the motions.

Another card game that has become all the rage.  On the plus side, it's much simpler than Race for the Galaxy, so the learning curve is much, much less steep.  Still, it's just one of those card games where you're amassing cards and playing them over and over again.  Just not my style.

UPDATE: After another play, I'm enjoying this more, although it still is not my style.

UPDATE #2: It continues to grow on me, although I can't say that I'll ever like it a whole bunch.

UPDATE #3: I think Seaside is decent, although I still prefer other games in this space.

Awesome idea. Plays so fast, we never need the 30 minutes. One of the best games ever! So fast and still so tactical/strategical! For the expansions: You hardly need to read/learn/remember any new rules, everything's on the cards.
Dominion is perfectly expandable. Promos and expansions are really useful unlike many expansions for other games.

I applaud Dominion for pioneering the deck building mechanic, however I really did not enjoy this game (whereas I enjoy other deck building games). The theme is generally one I would take to but the card art is so hideously uninspiring and the game play is dry.

RATING: 7
The pioneer in the deck building and drafting genre, it is unfortunately becoming dated as the field of similar games is continually refined and updated. While still fun to dust off and play occasionally, it does suffer from the fact there are a few very core strategies that will win you the game a majority of the time. 

In a group of experienced Dominion players, it largely comes down to draw luck and a race to the finish. That plus its lack of engaging player interaction really holds this title back from achieving a timeless status.

Unfortunately it has largely joined the ranks of Munchkin and Catan for our group: beloved classics and valuable introductions to the board game culture, but too tired and dated to see continual play in a modern field of game choices.

Fast and fun. Everyone I introduce it to enjoys it. It's less a game and more of a system, which means you'll be buying expansions. That said, the base set is the best way to learn. On its own, it's fun, but replayability increases with each expansion. Admittedly, there's not a lot of interaction, and that hurts the game somewhat, but I like it anyway. 

Puzzle Strike is the better deck-builder, but Dominion is (ironically) more of a puzzle, and that works better for people who prefer to do their own thing unimpeded by direct interference. I play with enough people like that to keep it around.

Brilliant deck building card game. Simple and fast to play with considerable strategic elements to consider due to the many different cards and combinations. The transition from play building to points collection is key and it can be very easy to misjudge or have a poor choice of disparate actions, with a corresponding crash'n'burn result. Fast game and my wife likes it. Expansions keep it fresh.

Very enjoyable game. I noticed my sister-in-law's disinterest as well as my wife's when we first got it.  They had no idea of why they were not interested.  I decided it was the name and we decided to call it "sunflowers".  My wife gave it a try and really likes it.  She and my son have been known to play a couple 2-player every day (less now).  With 6 expansions, we have a lot of variation.  We usually use random setups (from an ipad app).  The play count will become off since- what game do I put it under?  I have been going with the most latest of expansions but now it looks like that first expansion isn't played anymore.  We usually have to play a setup twice.  The first time I have a chance, but by the second play through, the others kick my butt.

RATING: 7
Should be required playing for everyone in the hobby.  Endless expansions and large variance within even the same set from game-to-game increase replayability.  Ultimately suffers heavily from the standard Euro drawbacks of "themeless" and "multiplayer solitaire".  A great puzzle to figure out each time but, ultimately, you'll tire of the package.

Got Hinterlands as a gift. Having more card types to choose from does help a bit. I suspect this one may be fading in popularity with my wife as she rarely wins.

Having an expansion has definitely breathed new life into this game. Also, C seems to have gotten a second wind as I seem to be losing more than winning. 4/2017

I played a few games face-to-face, then some games online (Brettspielwelt). It's an interesting game, primarily because it scratches the CCG-deck-building-itch, but the constant shuffling got a wee bit annoying. That, and having to keep track of how many actions and buys people were accumulating with each card played, are MUCH simpler online -- I'm pretty sure I'd rather play on BSW than face to face! Even if you get a mix of cards that slows the game down, it's pretty darn fast on BSW!

RATING: 9.8
Very, very good. I like to plan, this rewards planing and good timeing. I don't like the timeing so much, I'd rather ... a set number of turn maybe. But people keep talking about Dominion 'clones' -- like they are just a re-theme of this game. NO! Noting is as good as this, this is pure. There is a trade off you see, more points in hand means fewer 'useful' cards in hand, forcing one to time the ending tightly, or loose. The close add ... junk. A board, and you can have points on the board, but then there is no strategic trade off, so the game is not as good. Dominion, very good ... but the theme is lacking, I wish there were 'clones' I'd probably like them. Though the theme doesn't really matter.

A solid game. For its genre very original and I like it being out there. After a few plays it wasn't a thing I would go to regularly, but that's mostly because I don't really get into these deck building games. I tend to count cards in my stack and count probabilities and it's more of a math exercise for me. Still fun to play though. Just not fully my cup of tea.

Innovative game.  The whole game is about adding to your deck as you play, trying to get the right balance of engine cards and victory cards.  Replay value is huge, due to the gazillion different permutations of which cards are available each game.  CCG-like in mechanics but not nearly as thematic as a good CCG.

Ahhh, dominion, like an icy cold beverage on a hot summer day, it always satisfies. This game is flat out brilliant in structure and design. Flawless I would even suggest, if I were the type of person who suggested stuff. And I am , so I suggest you go out and buy this deck building game extrodinar! I also suggest that you play this son of a bitch till your fingers bleed!!! And then I suggest you bandage your hands so that you don't soil the game cards with your shamefully unworthy blood. And why do your hands bleed so easily anyway? I mean hemorrhaging just from playing a card game , albeit an exceedingly awesome card game, isn't really normal is it? I suggest you get that checked out, pronto, but not before you've played at least 17 games of the easy, yet immensely clever and entertaining dominion. One of my favorite games of all times! I suggest you try it yourself

Okay, I promised to restrain myself on buying games.    After my first play, I kept thinking about it that night, the next day, etc.  Then I arrived at a game session where Dominion was already underway and I had fun just watching it.  Did my FLGS have it in stock already???  Maybe I'll just check.  Alright, that's my last purchase for a while.  I promise!  I love card games with different combinations, and here the possibilities are endless.  In a strange way, it reminds me of my favorite game, St. Pete, in the sense that it's a good idea to build up your income early then go crazy buying victory points.  Update: I'm beginning to think it's my third favorite game of all-time, trailing only St. Pete and Superstar Baseball.  Bumping it up to a ten!

This is the game that got me into modern designer board games.  I played at a friend's board game birthday party and absolutely loved it so I picked up the big box which included Prosperity and Alchemy the next day.  This is a great introductory game to get others into other, more complicated, designer board games.

Like 7 Wonders, leaving some time in between plays makes this game a sweeter play, that's probably true for most board games though.  Also, once we started randomly selecting kingdoms instead of just using the recommended setups in the instruction book the variety made the game more attractive as well.

I like it better than Race for the Galaxy but still don't understand the hype. A good game though.

07/11/2008
Played with four players in a medium scenario. It worked well although some of the cards with similar prices were way much better than others wich I guess it's normal. I've found it odd.
I still think this is a good game, easy to play, difficult to master (I don't intend to master this game because I really hate having to know all cards and combos in order to play it right). A bit boring at some point. A seven is good enough for now.

03/01/09
Pushed the rate down to a five because this game is becoming obsolete after playing it not more than half a dozen times. Its hype doesn't make sense, the game is boring at some point. You could also play it without even looking at what you're doing and you may win!

Final edit:
And the winner is.... the player who can get 8 coins more often. It's not about building your deck or anything like it's all about getting those coins! 

This game has nice ideas but all in all it doesn't work for me. Plus I don't think that it deserves such a hype. 

PS: One of the things I hate to do is shuffling cards. A game that makes me do that all the time doesn't diserve much of my attention.

An interesting game - it has hundreds of cards compared to other games (500 to be precise!). I purchase the "Big Box" version which included alchemy and prosperity in it as well. I was surprised excited when I opened the book due to the sheer amount of cards found in it.

The game overall is simply a deck building game without you having to go to the store and buying booster packs to build your deck. However like many card games (take Magic The Gathering for example as it was based off that game), many cards seem slightly ... ridiculous. While I do like how the game allowing you "randomize" which 10 kingdom cards that will be part of the game - it seems some cards are a bit too strong once you've figured out how to chain it with other cards.

Cards, particularly ones that let you give more actions seem to allow many players to constantly chain their actions, making them able to play a ridiculous amount of cards in one turn. While some people argue that all the cards are of equal power (call me n00b if you wish), I find some cards a bit too strong.

What I do like is the overall idea of the game, you are building your deck (kingdom) in a simple manner. The game can easily be taught almost instantaneously (explain the "ABC" rule - action, buy, and cleanup phases). The game is much easier to learn as compared to 7 Wonders in my opinion (and easier to explain!) however I still greatly prefer 7 Wonders over this.

Worst part of the game? The constant shuffling you have to do which will require you to buy plastic sleeves :(

Picked this up because of how high it ranks on BGG.  Played a dozen or so hands of fake Dominion on my iPhone, and at this point I'm not sure if this game is for me.

7/23/11 - my only experience has still been limited to playing Battle of Gundabad, but I'm getting more into the game as a result.  Ascension is sort of losing my interest, and Dominion/BoG seems to offer a bit more complexity.

January 2012 -- FINALLY brought this to the table with two friends, and they both love the game.  Definitely much more fun with the "screw you" attack decks in the mix.

February 2012 -- Been playing once or twice a week for the past few weeks with the same two buddies.  We're really getting into it, going for a (mostly) random draw from the four sets I currently own.  Having a great time.

The godmother of deck-building, actually not sure if it was the first but it was the "Spiel des Jahres" and it definitely created the hype. Finally I got to play it! I love deck-builidng, next to route planning one of the game mechanisms I favor the most and it should be hard to disappoint me with a game of this type. Compared to the comic D-Bs I have played this is more straight forward and less thematic, therefor a bit easier to jump into.
I believe it deserves its reputation and am eager to try expansions.

RATING: 7
Brilliant game design. Prefer to St juan/RFTG. Perfect 30 minutes game. Balanced, very difficult to know when to 'go', how to play the others at table. Feels like drafting at magic without the boring bit - having to play afterwards! 

V addictive game. I prefer 2 players - just so the turn comes round to me quickly  Despite the millions of card permutations i think it is going to feel repetitive before too long. Edit - after 42 games not bored yet.
Stopped logging plays on BSW - over 150 i think.

Need an expansion. yep its great - it's multiplayer patience.Also the crack cocaine of games - the pleasure fades but you can't stop playing.

Sick to death of Dominion. In the top 10 on  the Geek? Ugh - might as well startplaying MtG again.....

May 2009. It's Ok a s a one off evening ender. Rating back up to  7

Now an 8 - with expansions. Its a brilliant game

RATING: 6
Nice game.  Plays quick, is easy to learn.  Seems like a filler to me more than anything.  While I enjoy the game, it is overhyped/overrated in my opinion.  This could just be because I never really got into CCG's, and I see the appeal amongst those who did.  Let's be honest with ourselves here, is this really a top ten game?  I think not.    Absolutely need the interactive cards or you are just playing multiplayer solitaire.  WARNING!  Horrible as a 6 player game!

Solid light, quick game.  I think I'll tweak it, but it's really fine the way it is.

Actually, the rating just dropped because of the formula, "With six coins, always buy gold.  With eight coins, always buy a province."  These become automatic actions, reducing choices, reducing pleasure.

Another drop: hasn't hit the table in months - no one's asked for it; I haven't felt like proposing it myself.

RATING: 7
Played about 50 games on BSW.  Usually I don't play board games online, I find it ruins them. This one is an exception.  It plays fast and, with my opponent in the same room, I get the social interaction without the shuffling. We found it very easy to learn. I agree that this would work as a gateway game for some new gamers.
I rate Dominion a 7.5 because although it's a good game I'm usually happy to play, I'm not as wild about it as others.  After 50 games, a play feels either samey or that I should "try a strategy for the heck of it".  Some random sets prove interesting, others not, but playing the same sets more than twice doesn't seem rewarding.
The game now feels like a filler, and doesn't rate as one of my top games - I like'em a bit meatier, like  Race for the Galaxy, or a bit more varied in activity, like Yspahan, or a bit more brain-burning, like Zertz.

If games were measured by how much they live up to their hype, I would hereby nominate Dominion for being the worst game in existence. I just don't understand why many people think this game is awesome. I find the deck-building concept quite interesting and appealing, but unfortunately that is all there is. Dominion feels like an idea to base a game on, rather than a complete game. It does play smooth and fast, and I don't even really mind the notorious shuffling all that much, but those traits only really matter when you actually want to play it. Which I don't. Dominion is by far the most disappointing game I've played.

2008/10/24: I've only played on BSW. Seems like a good game, but not great. The massive amounts of shuffling seem like they would get old in person, but I'm only guessing at this point. I'm happy to play it for an hour or two online though.

2008/10/29: Getting addicted to this now. Played 25 times over 5 days! I find myself trying one strategy with a group of cards and wondering how a different strategy with that set might work. The card play isn't where the choices are, rather it is what you purchase with the money you have this turn and what cards you add to your deck.

Come on, how bad is this ?

Another collectable card game, hidden in a board game box. Comes with a massive starter and an even more massive booster (Intrigue).
Watch out for umpteenth "boosters" and giveaways pouring into the market...
German board game of the year? What the heck !!!
Don't get me wrong, no bad game, but...
And I don't dare to try to play letting the action cards go by, only drafting money cards and buying point cards and do a runaway victory - crueling!

If it would be possible this game would get ZERO points.
So 1 point is for a mediocre game and 1 point for card quality and graphics...

You wonder why I keep and play it and bought the expansions? My 3 sons love it, and as I love my sons and to play with them, I have to "bite the bullet" from time to time..."

After several dozen plays, I'm going to adjust my rating to a 10. It's still amazingly replayable and addictive, and doesn't seem to get stale. More variety (with Intrigue) is of course better, but even with only 25 kingdom cards, I can't see myself tiring of Dominion any time soon.
------------------------

Pretty addictive, especially on BSW, where you don't need to shuffle. I prefer the random setup, where you have to find a different combo each time to win. There are lots of combos to explore, but I have the feeling that only a few are really effective. So for the long term, I fear that players of equal (high) experience will tend to make the same choices which cards to buy, so that the shuffle will to a high extent will determine the winner. But I'm happy to be proven wrong. In any case, that's not a stage I have come close to yet.

People keep comparing this with Race for the Galaxy. I can see why, but Dominion doesn't come close to Race in terms of variabilty, versatility and replayability.

This was one of the first games we got when we got into the hobby -- we loved how unique and different it was, but it wore out its welcome relatively quickly.  I've heard it described as a mechanic without a game, and I have to kind of agree.  There's zero theme (and we're pretty forgiving about lack of theme), and no player interaction (yes, there are the attack cards, but we don't like that dynamic -- they might give you a little boost in one turn, but overall I don't think they really add to the game, and are just generally nasty to play).  Trains: Rising Sun takes Dominion and turns it into a more interesting, more interactive, more thematic, fuller and therefore more fun game.

As the original deck-builder, all new iterations of the genre will be compared to Dominion, and while some bring new ideas to the genre, this game still stands the test of time.  That being said, as with most builders, there is an optimal strategy for churning cards into resources, into points, and the novelty of the game eventually relies on obtaining new expansions to add the base game.  I have few enough plays of this game, so using different combinations of cards in the offer is still unique, but I don't know how often this will make it to the game table.

This is my favorite game and the one that introduced me to the world of "designer games".

The good: highly flexible system with many potential routes to victory and wildly variable starting cards.  The rapidity with which you go through your deck mitigates many luck of the draw issues (really the "feel" of the luck, since that luck will often make the win difference since the scores between competent players will be so close).  Every expansion builds tremendously on the possibilities.

The bad: it is mostly solitaire in that you do not play specifically to thwart the other players.  For instance if you had a better card to play to help your progress, you wouldn't choose to not play it in order to play a militia card, simply because you saw two players use their moats for card draws during the same round already.

Could be a 9 (or maybe even a 10) if it weren't for all that damn shuffling!  The shuffling becomes a chore after a few plays--especially early where cards are few and decks run out quick.  If it only came with an auto-shuffler...

Played this several years ago shortly after it came out. It stuck in my memory as good, but not up to the hype at the time. I got a copy through a math trade and it's about how I remember it. Glad I picked it up, but also glad I traded instead of bought.

It's shorter than most of my other games, which is good because we have an abundance of long games in the house. The fact that it's different every time you play is nice, but some of the less strategic players aren't as adaptable. I'm thinking we'll probably just use the suggested decks most of the time...

Expansions... maybe pick up one of the big expansions, but I see this going to way of Munchkin: too many expansions ruins the game.

**EDIT** I'm bumping this to an 8, based on how it has stood up over time. People still want to pull this out, even though "Joe always wins" (totally not true).

Wow!!  I'm really very shocked on 2 accounts: this is a card game that I actually enjoy, and all the BGG hype is actually warranted!  I played this game for the first time VERY reluctantly, but after I played once I didn't want to stop!  I just hope that the enjoyment holds up to repeat plays, but judging by the nearly endless combination of cards that can be played, I don't expect this to be much of a problem.  Sure it's not perfect - the artwork on the cards is only mildly interesting, the user-created disks look much more practical than the constant shuffling, and the box seems rather huge for a card game (even if it does have 500 cards), - but it's fun game that has obviously been very extensively playtested, and my wife loves it.  All in all, my first "deck building" game was definitely a success!  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 2.5/5  Total: 6.5/10

RATING: 7
Note that these comments refer to Dominion as a whole -- my understanding is that the cards were designed at the same time but rationed out as "expansions" for commercial reasons. There are some additional comments under specific expansions. Rating for the base game alone is perhaps 6/10 or lower. These comments also refer to Dominion as played very quickly: it is best in electronic form and best if games take less than 15 minutes. Rating for play with a physical copy at the time listed on the box is closer to 2/10.

It's a truly amazing design. It's one of those elegant games that just seems so streamlined and perfect that it deserves to be a classic -- a game that will still be played in a hundred years. It's varied and quick; luck of the draw matters, but can be mitigated by deck management. There are clear strategies. It's easily expandable and the expansions make it more interesting. 

The more I play it, the more I appreciate the way different card sets require subtly different strategies -- one strategy that is dominant with one set is ruined by a counter present in another.

It's a curious sort of design, too. In the context of recent discussions over the brokenness of A Few Acres of Snow, it struck me that Dominion is basically broken by design: many Kingdom sets have a dominant strategy; the "game" is in recognizing and executing that strategy. But while many individual games of Dominion may be grossly unbalanced, the variety makes it forgivable.

The real issue is that it strikes a very poor balance been depth and time commitment. It should be a tremendous filler, but setup time is far, far too long and fiddly. Some pathological setups (particularly involving many attack cards) are guaranteed to drag on long after the fun has worn off. Even slight AP is crippling -- if a player takes more than 2 seconds of their turn to think then they are doing it wrong.

The various electronic versions (isotropic, Androminion etc.) are far superior; even an electronic version against an AI is better than playing in person.

I want to rate it higher, but I can't, because I have no interest in playing a physical copy ever again. The ratio between decisions and the physical manipulation of components (drafting, shuffling etc.) is too skewed towards the part that feels like work.

Ratings history: 6 -> 7

RATING: 6.5
Ok game, it's quick, fun and easy to grasp in a few games, although realizing the card synergies takes a while more; and it doesn't overstay its welcome. That said, I am not sure I would like to play more than once in a while because it is a bit too abstract for my liking. I am usually a sucker for expansions, but I feel for a casual approach the base game is enough for me.

Also, I prefer the more random approach of Ascension, in which you don't know in advance what cards will be available, this helps the game feel less scripted and more open.

After having our first child my wife and I needed a game that lived in the 40-60 minute range, was quick to pick up and had endless replay-ability. This fit wonderfully.

RATING: 10
This is still my favorite game. I love mulling over the cards at the beginning and then trying to execute my strategy. While just the base game is fun, Dominion really shines with an expansion thrown in. It almost doesn't matter which one you get. The only downside to the game is the large amount of shuffling.

One of favourites. Lost count how many times we've played this (+ expansions) probably over 60. Fairly quick gameplay (although not as quick as some imply, especially factoring in setup time). Curiously our friends have yet to be taken by it. I guess it's because the mechanics are quite unusual for non-gamers and it takes 2-3 plays to "get it".

Tried getting my parents to play but Dad took one look at all the text on the cards and just wanted to play Euchre!

Being a Magic player, this one was a bit too easy to "break."  I had a big multi-card combo going 5 turns into my first time playing, much to the shock of the people I was playing with.  I'd say for the CCG crowd, avoid buying... for the casual board game crowd, it's a lot of fun!

[2 plays] Initial reaction rating.  I enjoyed getting to try out this game.  It was not hard to catch on.  I have played with basic setup and random setup.  I think it is cool that you can swap out the action decks to make the game different from play to play.  It is a good fast, interesting filler game.  This game does not quite have the appeal to me as some of the longer, more complex games do, but it is good variety to mix in.  I would be happy to play and learn this game more.

A quick, easy to learn deck building game. There is some strategy to how you set up your deck and a lot of re-playability.  The flaw is that there isn't a lot of direct confrontation and strategy depends on the luck of connecting cards' abilities.  When I am finished with a game I am left wanting a little more strategy and feeling something is missing.

[RGG 2009 edition] {Medieval; deck-building; scalable} There is so much hype about Dominion that I can't help getting it.  Its core mechanic is unique -- building decks during the game.  It allows both tactical and strategic plays.  Luck is not very strong.  It's more essential to manage the hand properly.  Replayability is very good due to the different combination of kingdom cards.  I am a little bit concerned about the balance of cards.  Depends on card combination, player interaction may be weak.  Keep on shuffling the cards is quite tiresome.  Nonetheless, it's a good and solid game.

The artwork of the game scares me.  It's ugly!  Why gold is not gold, silver is not silver and copper is not copper.  Using dull number on the cards is scary.

This is very great attempt for first-time designer.  Keep up the good work, Donald!

RATING: 9
Great.  Nearly endless variety of games based on combinations of cards that can be chosen for set.  On the app, this is a quick game.  In person, it can drag on quite a bit if you have some slower plays due to sequential nature of play, action stacking, and constant reshuffling.

I've been lucky enough to be in on some of the later, near-final-build playtesting (read: playing and going "I really don't have any complaints except that I can't buy it yet") of this game, and I predict it will be an incredibly hot item toward the end of the year.  If you take attempting to build a really good deck for a CCG, and make an awesome game around that feeling, you get Dominion.  I've only played three-player games of it, but I assume that two and four work just as well.  Plays in about 20-30 minutes, generally, except that you can never play just one game of it.  Not quite a 10 in my book yet, I'm reserving final judgment for when I've played the final build, but for right now I'm incredibly impressed with it.

The first deck builder i know of, and probably the first ever.

Even if it isn't i'm sure that it has set the trend and paved the road for all others.

This base game only, has some unbalanced cards, but with only 1 ban (smithy) the game is pretty enjoyable.

I really love the fact that you need to balance every little thing in the deck you build, that being:
1. how much cards you have
2. how many actions you are left in each hand
3. how much gold you have
4. how many victory cards you have
5. 1-4 at approximate time of finishing the game :D

That all makes your head explode, and you can always blame it on the luck :D so all in all it is very interesting

I have played a fair amount of the Dominion base set and less of the various expansions, so my rating is for the base game only (my friends who love the game insist it's much better as you add in more expansion cards). I'll give this game a ton of credit for the deckbuilding mechanic which I love, but the base set has a ton of problems once you start to get better at it. Certain cards are too good for their costs and certain kingdoms have fairly degenerate strategies.

I don't really want to spend $200 to get all the expansions and everything that allegedly improve on my complaints so I wish somebody would put together a "greatest hits" version of the game or something that results in the best experience for a reasonable price.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The deckbuilding game.

I've marked it down because there are certain cards (village and chapel for example) that are just too strong for what they cost and you should get as many in your deck as you can.  

In addition to this the cost of cards is very important, which forces you to never have too many 5 and 6 cost cards avaialbe each game.  This basically means that the replayability isn't as high as it would seem.

It's a good game and I've played it a lot.

Ideally, a game should strive for players to describe it as "easy to learn, lifetime to master". Dominion's brilliantly streamlined deck-building and plentiful expansions bring it as close to embodying that description as any game ever designed.

Having said that, I wouldn't start with the base game. I would advise new players to get Intrigue first, and expand from there.

Seconds to explain, 30 mins to play, and with the random supply decks, each game seems to have its own shape and requires a different approach from players.

Rating raised after 10 plays.

Rating dropped after adding Intrigue - I enjoy the original Dominion less when elements of Intrigue are added. I'm less likely to suggest the game now because other people will then suggest mixing it with Intrigue.

The best part of Magic: The Gathering was drafting. This is a drafting card game, and the first game using this mechanic that I played.  I wouldn't mind picking up a couple more sets someday, but right now A:NR is about the only card game I want to play. Slightly low score because 'fun' strategies are just not that competitive and I find just playing lean and mean to be hard to beat.

I like the way that this game gives you lots of options for how to play, but if you want to win you need to focus down onto a strategy and follow it through.

Over a year ago I tried to introduce my 8 year old son to Thunderstone because I thought he would like the theme.  I tried to explain what the game was about and he wasn't interested in trying a card game.  He wanted a game with mini's!

My wife wanted to play Dominion and even though it is the most popular game at our meet up's, she couldn't get into a game.  I played it and after the game I wasn't sure what the big deal was.  I felt that if I never played Dominion again I wouldn't miss it.

I was able to trade for a copy of the game for my wife to try.  It's short and I will play just about any game if my wife likes it.  

Surprise, surprise,  not only did my wife like it but my Zombicide loving son really liked it.  It appeals to his capitalist nature.  After a few more plays I  like it too.  It is fun to look at all of the cards and try to create a strategy to get your engine going.  

After about 10 plays I was kind of bored but Dominion does have a lot of expansion to increase variety.

The basic mechanic is innovative and promising. While luck can be a big factor, victory is usually achieved by the player who came up with the best idea of what to do with the available kingdom cards.
Sometimes the set of kingdom cards (randomly) chosen for a game can be rather one-sided. Some card combinations are obvious strategies while others are hardly good in combination with the other available cards.
It's a great game overall though!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A good strategy game with excellent depth. It has a few flaws: you need the expansions to make the game really shine, and a lot of the cards in the base set could have been made stronger. Despite that, Dominion is an excellent expandable game that I could play over and over again. It's really most of the fun of a CCG, squeezed into a eurogame box. 

Note: Rating is for the entire system, not the base game. I find that Intrigue and Seaside have more interesting cards overall - you can actually skip the base game.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Seemed bland at first, but it grew on me. Its fast moving, and different combinations of cards present different challenges.  I really like that they give you the 1 extra of each card to randomize card mixes.  I don't like that sometimes you essentially lose a game in the early draws and just spend many turns buying nothing more than a cellar and waiting for the end to come.

I used to rate Dominion an 8, but I've been forced to drop that because the game now bores me to tears.  There is almost nothing to do when it's not your turn unless there are a lot of attacks in play.  When those are in play, they make the game unnecessarily long.  Add that up and it just ruins the game for me.  Don't even get me started on curses.  It's just too long for what it is.

The granddaddy of the deck builders! This game is easy to pick up. Play one action, buy one card. Until you buy a card that gives you another action, or a buy, or lets you draw another card, which might give you another action, or another coin (you see where this is going.) The rotating cards in the base set alone allow for amazing replayability. Start adding expansions and you will never play the same game twice unless you choose to do so.

I cant see why some people are so entusiastic about this game. The mechanic is pretty dull, and the special cards dont add much to make the mechanic any more interesting.

I'm not saying there is not a game to be played, but one doesn't seem to have been on a Gaming Journey after playing it.

A well thought out game. It offers the player numerous decisions and there are several strategies that can be adopted. There's also a lot of variety here due mainly to the different card combinations that the game offers (this will increase greatly with future expansions providing the game with a huge amount of replay value) and virtualy every game is different. I personally don't feel as though I interact with this game quite as much as other similar games (i.e. card based) but there's a real simplicity to the gameplay, which means that it can be used as an excellent gateway game for novice gamers. The one problem I have with it however is the amount of randomness generated by continually having to discard your hand and re-draw cards. Personally I prefer games it which you have a little more control over the decisions you're faced with.

Played 30+ times. What a neat game.  It plays fast and has plenty of decisions.  Most of the decisions are in what to buy and when to switch from money to collecting vps.  It's a little repetitive turn to turn, but I enjoy watching the deck I build come together.  Also I could certainly see the freshness of the game wearing off, but with only using 10/25 cards that should take a while and be easily fixed with expansions.  **UPDATE** Dominion is awesome!  It plays quickly, and I really enjoy the experience.  The deck construction plan, slow execution and tweaking, as well as watching it play out hand to hand is just delicious. 
**UPDATE** On it's way to my most played game of all time and firmly in my top 10. 2009/05/01

Seems complex, but actually isn't that much of a hassle. Once you get a grip on the rules the game can become very fast-paced. Do buy sleeves for the cards (500!) because you're in for a LOT of shuffling.

This is my current, all-time favorite game. I only own 3 expansions but still find the game to be amazing. The premiere, pure deck building experience. More and more competition every year but Dominion is still the king. Actual score 9.95

RATING: 9
Everytime I play this I feel like I am building a deck to get ready to play Magic: The Gathering, but the game is about the building of deck on the fly. Instead of about the perfecting of a set deck to take to a tournament. Which is refreshing and everyone has the same set of cards to work with, but from a communal pool that limits the amount. Neat concept overall.

RATING: N/A
A very good game. It is a quick card game, where the most choices (but not all) are: "which card should I buy?". Still, it is the game where you need to adapt to the set of random cards, observe other players and very strictly plan your card deck. Very addicting. However, after 50+ plays, I'm a little bored with it.

Number of plays: more than 50.

Maybe there is too little player interaction, but once you get the hang of the strategy it's interesting to see how you can curve statistics in your favor.

I play this 2-player only and a turn takes about 20 seconds if you really think it over.
Compared to many other games out there there is very little tendency for analysis paralysis, because you usually make a plan to begin with and stick to it.

It's a good game, although a little light compared to Race for the Galaxy and Call of Cthulhu, but its ease of play is a big plus when you can't muster the mental resources for an hour of brain burning and just want a game where you slap some cards on the table.

This quickly became one of my favorite games.  The base set is pretty vanilla, but the expansions are fantastic.  

The game is mostly strategical with just the right amount of luck tossed in.  It scales great from 2 to 4 players, but more than that and the game can take too long.  Most games I play finish within 30 mins, which means it makes several appearances each game night.

Huge crush on Dominion right now. Admittedly, if I sat down with just one set of 10 cards, I'd complain that this game was boring after about three plays. But since the possible cards are always changing, this is never a problem.

In fact, the joy of the game is that you're constantly learning something new, not really that the game itself is brilliant. It's like cracking open a new box every single time and playing a brand new game. Love it.

This rating could go down to 7ish if I lose that constant new game feel, but up to 10 if it sticks around for 15 or so more plays.

Fantastic, innovative (original?) deck building mechanic. The rest of the choices made in developing this game are just bad. The theme what is it? I dunno something vaguely medieval. Victory pts? Blech! Even worse having this tableau of cards face up, so everyone knows what you're doing and its a race to do it. Not enuf cards at the start; shuffling 10 cards is lame. The worst is the default strategy of buying Province when possible, then Gold when possible, then silver. On the good side; does not overstay it's welcome, provides a nice social setting, it's fun. I hate this game mainly for it's poor development choices; on the creative side it has one Great mechanic. So I am torn.

Great game that fed our love for creating nifty card combos, but we played this to DEATH initially over the 2008 holidays (our gateway game), and we burnt out quickly (partly due to the competition it received as more new games came into the house). Still a terrific game though.

It's ok. However, I've found that Thunderstone is just a far superior game both in theme and in mechanics. While I haven't played with any of the expansions the disparity between the quality of certain cards prevents this from having too many replays as the strategy is pretty much "Is the village in play, buy villages!"

Over 450 plays for this now (not counting electronic versions).  You need to add Dominion and Intrigue together to get my total plays.  I have all the expansions through Guilds and play with random sets of cards.  Every game is different.  I love this game!  So excited with the announcement another expansion is coming.

I love the challenge of looking at each set of 10 Kingdom cards and working out the best strategy.  Even with over 200 different cards now available - the rules are simple enough for anyone to grasp.

The original "Deckbuilding" game. Wow. It's great! This is a definite keeper. I'm writing this 8 years after I received this (from myself) for Christmas..... and it really is still great.

- Deck building strategy game that even my girlfriend seem to enjoy at some extent. It has a medieval theme but the mechanicas of the game I would uess could fit into any theme really.
- Simple fun, it takes about 30 min to get a victory and you have so many ways to build up your deck with different cards that basically any game will be different in some way.
- Multitude, Dominion comes with loads of different types of cards and they can all be combined in any way to make the playing field. And of course you also have several expansions to choose from to ass more mechanics into the gaming experience.

tl;dr: holds up

I've never been one to go all in on Dominion. I like the concept, but I also felt like it was something that would be enjoyed best when not played to death. I also never got any other boxes but the base set. I don't play it a lot, but I recently got to play it again after a 7 year period of not playing it. And it still holds up. The base mechanism is just so rock solid it's not surprising it has been copied so many times. With all the variety of cards in the base set, there is already a lot of play value there, and I don't need to own every single card available.
I'm personally not a fan of the attack cards, I feel like most of them just make the game longer and this game is best when it takes about 30 to 45 minutes.
I will be enjoying this game for years to come, just very sparingly :)

One of, if not the first deck-building game. Coming from having played other deckbuilding games first, this base set seemed pretty boring with not a lot of realistic choices on what to buy in a given turn. The other Dominion base (Intrigue) and all of the other expansions are more interesting than this set.

The game often more or less plays itself, there are really only two strategies ("gardens+lots of copper" or "gold+provinces"). Shuffling the deck again and again keeps it too random for my taste. Nevertheless it's quite enjoyable and recommended to play with non-gamers as well.

I played collectible card games before and therefore am familiar with the concept of deck-building. Finding the deck-building process turned into a game on its own was a nice idea - and actually a wonder nobody thought of that before.
The game works very well and I enjoy playing it relatively regularly - but for a higher rating, it needs far more player interaction.
Player interaction is an important component in collectible card games, and it's a shame you don't see that much of it in Dominion.

I don't think I'm quite as enamored with this as some people around me are.  Mostly to me, it seems like a race to the province cards.  Build an engine that lets you usually buy one of those a turn, and repeat until they are gone, see if you won.  More plays would probably flesh this out, but most strategies basically seem to be variants as to the best way to get 8 gold in your hand a turn.

I agree with Marshall, I thought my group needed a copy, so I got it, but I really wish "someone else" owned it.

Edit: In the end, I got rid of it.  Not because everyone in the group started to not like it, but because I didn't want to play the game, and if it was on the shelf, people would suggest it.  Now, if they want to play it, they can get a copy.

- heavily card-based (sleeves necessary)

Minél kevesebb kell belőle, és inkább pénzt kell csak szerezni, amint lehet ezüstöt majd aranyat (így a saját pakliban kevés akció lap lesz és aránylag sok ezüst és arany, így könnyen összejöhet 5 lapból is a 8) és mehet is a Tartomány... Így nem valami izgalmas.

A fun and easy-to-learn kingdom building game. Everyone starts off with the same amount of money, but each kingdom can progress differently. There are many cards to buy and ways to achieve the winning goal. Each game will use 10 Kingdom decks, and the base game has 25 Kingdom decks to use. So each game will require a different approach to winning.

I know a lot of people are burned out on Dominion (or maybe burned out on buying all the expansions), but this is a great game.  The basic gameplay is easy and quick to explain, and you can even start playing before you finish explaining the rules -- the first round can be played with an open hand without breaking the gameplay.

Dominion is fine, if sometimes unexciting. Interaction is low, but you're engrossed in the pistons of your card engine. I haven't seen another deckbuilder perform much better, anyway - despite that other deckbuilders are addicted to superfluous rules.

When I first played Dominion, I intensely hated it. I felt like the other players were not helping me learn the game, and were using that against me to win.  Years later from that experience, I am SO happy I went back to this game.  It is likely my favorite all time game.  

Dominion is a 'deck-building' game. Your goal is to buy cards to put into your deck that allow you to more effectively buy point cards.  The game mechanics are remarkably basic, and can be taught in seconds.  The depth of play has to do with how different cards augment the basic things you can do with your cards.  The rules are so wildly varied and dynamic that it is possible to play this game hundreds of times without playing with the same set of 10 action cards.  There is some player interaction with cards that do things to other players, but for the most part it is a race to the highest score.  If you like very high player interaction, this game is not the best.  That being said.........

Play this game!  As a base set, the cards in this box are simple and straightforward.  They are great to start playing with, and don't take a lot to figure out.  The expansions add that depth once you are used to the mechanics and basic interactions of the game.  Things never feel old and you can fit 2-3 rounds of Dominion comfortably in an evening of play.  In my opinion, the game itself plays best with 3 players, but plays refreshingly fast with 2 players and has more opportunity with interaction with 4 players.  

Why did I give this a 9 and other Dominion sets 10?  Simply put, the expansion sets make this game.  The card interactions are simply mind boggling and endlessly entertaining.  This set is a simple starter kit to get you ready for the delicious variety that comes with the greater scope of the game.

19-Nov-08: Can see why this appeals to Magic players who are into Deck Construction. It took a while for the card actions to sink in, and I still find it hard to find synergies with the cards, apart from the simple 'Get cards that give you more Gold and Actions'. So far, I feel it's a game where you try to better your chances to draw 8+ gold with 5 cards. Provinces cost 8 Gold, so if you're the first to get to the point where you can buy at least 1 Province per turn, you've effectively won the game.

Still need more plays before I can give a definitive review. I only have the base set, but I've enjoyed it when I play it. I don't usually like to suggest it, though, because it seems like it takes a long while to set up and tear down. Would rather play something quicker like Ascension or Hero/Star Realms.

One thing that I really appreciate is the victory point mechanic, wherein victory points are added to the player deck, thus diluting it with important but inert cards. It's a clever way to slow down the first place player, and discourages one person from snapping up all of the cheap VPs.

A great, easy-to-play game. Shows, in contrast to Race for the Galaxy, that complexity doesn't have to be accompanied by confusion. Vaguely reminds me of Goa, due to the advantage of multiple actions. Very replayable.

It seems like a majority of games need the same tactic. Buy a province, gold, or silver if you can. Rinse, repeat. Some cards make you change that tactic, but not that many in the basic set--many in the expansions.

An absolutely [b]superb[/b] box tray! A place for every deck of cards, stored vertically so they're easy to grab and can't slid out with the box top on. (Still, once you get a couple expansions, you're looking for something more compact. Best solution I've seen: every deck in a bag.)

But why in the world aren't gold cards gold, silver cards silver, and copper cards copper????

One of the original deck builders, good, innovative, and fun.  Building a deck and having a magic like ccg feel in a living card game style really is a winning combo for this game.  The theme is alright, perhaps dry and generic, but this game has always been more about the mechanics of deck building anyhow.  The number of decisions and yet simplicity of rules make for a very dense amount of strategy in a simple to explain game.

One thing I would mention is to not play this with experienced players or play it with lots of players, both are extremely painful.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I was starting to worry some of my regular gamers were going to start grinding up the cards and shooting them up intravenously.  It's a unique take on deck building, which is oddly the actual mechanic of the game.  Dominion's play is a unique look at constructing a deck of cards that actually works quite well and inspires some nostalgia of CCG days in my youth.  I love the design and system as well as the choice making nature of it.  I'm also quite fond of the the replayability through various selections of card types and the fact that it seems well balanced.

No two games of Dominion are the same. By itself there are hundreds of possible combinations (this estimate feels correct, there are 25-30 different action cards, and 10 cards are played in a game) Now with the Intrigue expansion out, it has taken things to a new level. Either game could be played 20-30 times in a short period, and still not exhaust the possible alternate combos, But adding them together is just perfect.

While I think it is fun, it is better once it begins to move faster.  This is one that I would have said maybe 6.5 the first six plays, 7 the next six and on.  It offers a surprising amount of variety, and I've gotten non-gamers to enjoy this. It doesn't, however, have real long-term staying power. I played it lots and with lots of different groups for about three years off-and-on. Less after that. Almost never now (haven't in at least three years). I would play it again (I'll have forgotten enough that it won't be obvious from the setup what everyone will do), but it will never be a weekly thing like it could have been in 2008/2009. I probably won't get rid of it, though. Well, not yet.

SEPT 2014 - NOTE: My rating is for the BASE game ONLY. I have ALL the expansions and a custom wood box. It needs it when you have everything. My rating for Dominion overall with ALL expansions together is probably 8.5 - I still haven't gotten tired of it with all the possible combinations of different cards. I'm guessing I *still* haven't played EVERY card available, but I'm not sure.

My son has been very active in wanting to play Dominion lately and I haven't balked at all!
-----------------------------
APR 2009 - Played the Black Market and Envoy promo cards. I like both cards. Black Market adds the ability to get a card that the other person won't be able to get which is great. Envoy lets you draw 4 more cards into your hand. Both are powerful to a point, but not overwhelmingly so as I first thought they would be. 
------------------------------
APR 2009 - Played with my 8 yr old daughter and she really liked it. However, she didn't quite get the idea of chaining cards together initially. After explaining it a couple of times I think she'll really get it soon. I still enjoyed playing and am looking forward to trying some of the other Kingdoms.
------------------------------------------------
JAN 2009 - First time playing this I really had a great time. The person I played with wasn't initially confrontational with the basic setup kingdom cards. So, when I started playing Militia and he didn't have any moats, it really started hurting his hands. He still was initially successful at getting many VP cards including Province cards, but I made a strong comeback and nearly won.

I love the ability to chain cards together - this is a feature similar to what you can do in Pillars of the Earth which I also really liked.

The game is fun, but in any one game between two similarly skilled players, luck will determine who wins in a big way.

You know what really turns me off this game?  I really like games that have lots of cards which give you interesting powers, which this has, but too often the optimal strategy in a given setup is to buy 1 or 2 action cards.  Combos are fun, but rarely do they win against a streamlined strategy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Really an interesting and unique system. Multiple sets of cards which players will slowly "draft" - incorporating into their individual decks. Each deck evolves until the player is able to use their deck for scoring. Quick playing (though slow to setup and pickup). A good variety of cards makes each game unique and each has a slightly different flavor.

UPDATE: After playing the "successor" to this style of game - Thunderstone - I'm dropping my rating of Dominion. Yes, the mechanic is unique, but ultimately this game is pretty boring. It is a build an economic engine game - the choices each turn are fairly limited and repetitive.

Solid game of deck building that I still find clever. A bit too solitaire-ish for my tastes overall, and the "just grab money" strategy is a bit too inviting with the basic set. On the other hand, with the expansions, I have a problem with the elaborate, often beautiful combinations that experienced players string together. As with many recent games that offer a lot of different cards (or tiles, or buildings, or powers, etc.), I have the suspicion that I'd be better off studying everything ahead of time -- but the game nonetheless forces me to search for combinations on the fly. This is the nature of deck building games, but it's not an experience that will ever appeal to me in more than a passing way. Compare to Magic, for example, where everyone constructs a deck ahead of time, and has the opportunity to complete most of the "work" ahead of time. Play then becomes mostly about creative use of cards. That said, I still find the basic Dominion set an enjoyable game from time to time, especially with more casual players.

This game had a very loud buzz coming out of Essen 2008, and for good reason.  The deck building is a lot of fun, as you try to make your deck more efficient than the other players'.

A high rating because it pioneered a genre and has a lot of variability.  I find that the base game gets boring after about 5 plays while many of the cards in the expansion are too wordy/complicated for new players.  I dislike a lot of the attack cards, but at the same time if there are no attack cards it becomes too multiplayer solitaire.  I can objectively say this is a good game, but it's not a game I want to play often.

The idea that we, as players, are recruiting agents of dominance into our repertoire whether it be militia, certain types of buildings and establishments, members of the occult, even simply money, all of which we are using as a selection of cronies to do our bidding and win dominance over the land oozes forth through the gameplay. The game moves quickly, the mechanics are brilliantly strategic and luck can be fairly well mitigated as you streamline your deck (engine). It is a closed system, making gameplay fair. There is a minor balancing issue in terms of advantage for first player, and possibly the game should be split into rounds (and therefore the game only ends at the end of a round once conditions have been met) but still, it can be pretty tight. A marvel to study strategically, much like Chess in it's variation yet tightness as a closed system.

After playing so many different games these past years, I was surprised that some game can really make an impression with a new and clever mechanism. Dominion did that. Really good. There's quite a bit of luck in the draws, do the 3's and 2's you bought come up at same time so that you can buy one of the bigger value cards or money card or points. It's deck-building, yeah, and you should optimize your deck to the best you can - but there's still luck, say what you will. Still, Dominion is enjoyable little romp I can play whenever suggested.

Gift form Sam before he moved out.

Have friends who love it but I always just thought it was ok. Doesn't help that now they've played a bazzilion times online they just flatten us every time now if we play in person. I now only play with them if they let me choose the kindom cards, otherwise they just go for a hand optimising strategy of trashing cards, getting extra actions and drawing extra cards, so that a few rounds into the game and they have their entire hand on the table every turn. Makes it a little less fun for the non-diehard of us!

I was first introduced to Dominion a year ago by my college fairing younger brother. Since then, Dominion and its expansions have been a family favorite and go to game. My children (ages 8 and 9) love playing and my wife is always in a competitive mood to play.

We now own the base game and 2 expansions (Alchemy and Seaside) and we play them often (usually 3-4 times a month). As far as re-playability, this game has kept our interest for a year.

This is also a great game for anyone wanting to get into deck builders.

A friend of mine ended up bringing this to a board game night that we host, and we all loved it, especially after playing multiple games of 7 Wonders.
Overall I find it to be a very good drafting economy game, and it seems to have high replay value.

RATING: 8.9
This game seemed to divide our group, with opinions ranging from "it's too random which cards you draw when", through "it's not bad, but I don't get what all the hype is about", right up to "this is awesome". I fall into the latter camp, though I haven't played it nearly enough to judge it properly, especially given the fact that every play is completely different.

Edit: Finally got another game of this in after a long absence, and it seems to be catching on a bit more with our group now. I love the way that every game of it is different. This recent play was rather dominated by the Militia card, with rarely a round played that we weren't mostly down to three cards.

Edit: This has become a firm favourite now, even eclipsing 7 Wonders as our lunchtime game of choice. We've played several games of it in the last few weeks, and I'm beginning to get more of an idea of strategy. I love the game so much, I've even ordered one of the expansions, and our group has bought another. I look forward to finding out how all the new cards affect play.

Edit: Having played this extensively on Isotropic, and subsequently on Goko since Isotropic's untimely demise, this has become more of an addiction than a game to me. The online versions, while lacking some of the fun of handling the real physical cards, have the advantage of removing one of the few downsides of this game - the amount of time it takes to set up and pack away all the cards. The ability to play a deeply skilful and strategic game in something like 10-15 minutes makes this one of my favourite games ever.

A multi-player solitaire game.  Little player interaction.  Play depends highly on the cards in your hand, and your choice of what to do is obvious much of the time.  Determination of when the game ends (depletion of 3 piles of cards or the pile of Province cards) seems more arbitrary than strategic.

RATING: 10
I would not have purchased the expansions for this game if it weren't for the base game. There is simply no better card game that starts everyone on equal footing and provides a slight level of variation (luck) to give everyone a chance at winning. There are a few dud cards in this game but it takes an extensive number of plays to generalize and requires a high level of thinking to master.

I haven't try the expansions yet, but most of the people said the game with the expansions was more exciting. For beginners maybe a bit hard to understand at first, but if you understand it helped you to know more difficult game rules too.

Hand management, or rather deck management at its finest. Theme is one of the most pasted-on in existence, to the point where I'd almost prefer this as an abstract card game. Great artwork though. I'd imagine it's very fast-paced once you get the hang of it, and the number of different decks (25) should offer great replayability.

Interesting game mechanic, but after many games i dont see the fun anymore. The game doesnt answer "why am i playing this" very well.  There's no purpose. Its a filler that takes too long to set up.  Thunderstone does this game much better.

RATING: 9
Pros: Fast and enjoyable.
Deep strategy.
Nice card variety.

Cons: Lighter cardstock.
Artwork not as good as it can be.
Base cards will eventually wear.

Conclusion: The base game of Dominion is a fantastic deckbuilding game that gets played often in my circles.  There is enough interaction with other players to make it much more than a solataire game.  I'm excited to see the expansions that are coming out and how they will work with the base card set.  This game deserves the "Game of the Year" honors it is getting.  Fantastic!

After the first game, my wife said "it was ok" but then asked to play again the next day.  Can't remember the last time that happened, so that alone gets extra rating points.  Really like the gameplay, and building decks.  Never played Magic, so a new mechanic for me.

Moves quickly and has plenty of replay value. It's a card game with all the luck that invariably invites, but there's plenty of room for strategy to pay off, as well.

RATING: 10
Great game. Instantly went on my short list of top favorites. Long-term replayability? Time will tell, but it looks promising.

If you like lighter euro games, this is a must-have. If you like multi-player solitaire or non-confrontational games, this game works well that way too; just don't play using Attack cards.

At first glance, the game appears way overpriced, if you look only at what you get for components. $30 street price for a little stack of cards? But if you consider enjoyment per dollar, this game is a great buy.

[Updated] After several more plays, my rating goes from 9 to 10. Amazingly good game. Every game is different - even changing out just one of the 10 action cards gives it a different dynamic. The expansions add even more great variety into the mix.

Fast to explain. Fast to play. Every game can be different, just tweak the card selection (or number of cards of some type available!). This never gets old, and is one of the easier games for beginners, yet stays deeply strategic . . . Perfection.

RATING: 6
Interesting and addictive game.  I think one thing about it that I don't like is that all players don't get the same number of turns, giving players earlier in the round a significant advantage, esp near the end of the game when decks are more powerful.

This game is pretty good, but I'm starting to get a little burned out on it.  Then again, 23 plays in one week is still an impressive number of plays!

(Later)Yeah, I'm not that interested in playing much more.  The variability of the cards plus the fact that the game is so short means that there is very little meaningful long-term strategy planning in the game (beyond the randomness of the cards, of course).  Maybe if we played with the same 10 cards repeatedly this wouldn't be an issue, but with switching cards out all of the time, I can't say that I'm all that interested in playing much more.

(Even later)  Played for the first time on BSW yesterday, and I have to say that that's the best way to play the game.  The constant shuffling is avoided, and the game is just smoother that way.  Like it much better on BSW than F2F, though I admit that it's making me interested in playing more F2F, too.

Dominion blends the mood of Magic with a single 500-card set that prevents fans from buying their way to victory with expansion packs.  It is one of the most efficient machine-building games I've ever played.  Dominion plays with alacrity, and even Dad likes it!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
:thumbsup: There are great games out there that use deck building to good effect, but if you focus just on the mechanic itself, no other game I know does it better than Dominion. Dominion distills deck building to its purest form and takes it very seriously.
:thumbsup: Fantastic with 2 players. There's little to no downtime with another experienced player.
:thumbsup: The essence of the game is the random setup. Before the game starts, you will evaluate the 10 kingdom cards that players will be able to buy this game, look for synergies, and make a plan how to build the best deck with these cards. It takes the best parts from CCG/LCG deck construction (creativity, variety, card synergy) and condenses it to a much smaller card pool and time frame.
:thumbsup: You get a sense of achievement from building your deck and seeing how you can have progressively stronger turns.
:thumbsup: There's a turning point where you need to decide to stop primarily improving your deck and focus on buying victory point cards. It usually depends on both the strength of your deck and your opponent's deck. It's a fine line, and if you go for victory points too early, you might clog up your deck and be unable to finish the game quickly.
:thumbsup: I love how every additional expansion exponentially increases the overall replayability of the game.
:thumbsup: The variety of different card effects across the expansions is tremendous, and yet everything fits into the gameplay nicely.
:thumbsup: One of the less obvious advantages of Dominion over a CCG/LCG is that as you card pool and options grow, the amount of time and effort required to play the game stays low. You don't need to know and analyze 500 different cards you own to be able to build a deck. You only ever need to consider 10 cards in isolation, and what combination of these particular cards can win you the game.

:?block: Artwork style varies and can be a little inconsistent. And although some artwork is really not that great, I think I came to appreciate the scope and variety of different illustrations – there are professions, landscapes, structures, buildings, rooms, people and places. There's also some card art that I like a lot!
:?block: The theme of the game is rather abstracted, but I do like how many cards have names and artwork that capture thematically what the card does in the game.
:?block: There's a lot of shuffling in Dominion, and there's just too many cards for me to be willing to sleeve the entire game and use a faster mash shuffle.
:!block: It can be hard for new players to figure out how to play well, or what playing well even means. It may also take many plays with some expansions to start to fully appreciate Dominion.

Szerintem ez egy szuper deckbuilding, mert imádok kombózni a lapokkal. Kiteszem ezt amiért kitehetem emezt, húzok 2 lapot, most kiteszem azt meg amazt. Nagyon jó az újrajátszhatósága, mivel nem egyszerre az összes fajta lap játszik. Amikor a játék végén elkezded victorys lapokkal higítani a paklidat is jól működik és pont akkor ér véget amikor kell, nagyon jól ki van találva a 2 játék végét jelentő kondíció. Viszont legalább 3 fő szükséges hozzá. Kicsit kevésnek érzem a lehetőségeimet a védekezésre amikor sok attackos lap kerül játékba.

Played at Essen Spiel 2009. It was fun and we bought it, although it was immediately obvious that it is multiplayer solitaire with just a few interactive cards.

RATING: 5
Downtime is high. Playing with slower people can be frustrating. Some combos run on forever. When running a combo, decisions won't be placed until you actually draw your cards from the combo. Shuffling takes forever and it's too hard to regulate everyone to shuffle completely. At some point, there's no turning back from a dead strategy and you're milling around till the game ends. Despite all this, I still like it. I have a history of being a MtG deckbuilder. I would build all kinds of funky decks to see how they would come out working. A game based on variably building an efficient deck with a goal to morph it to a totally inefficient slab of points by the time the game ends (which is variable) still has me coming back for more despite the downtime.

Update: Downtime wins. I lose. Not enough thinking past initial setup w/ planned branching. Ends up being a select a strategy then see what happens game. Would rather play many other games at this point.

It's a beautifully designed game.  The custom deck-building from a common pool of cards is my favorite part.  Everyone starts with the same options and has more-or-less, equal access to them, which makes thing competitively balanced.  It also has a well-balanced luck/skill ratio, especially with the discarding options, which let you really specialize your deck, and make it very predictable if you want.  It definitely works best with 2-3 players.

RATING: 6
Deck building and combining card effects much like CCGs, without all the time and money. Not extremely thematic, but it has all the fun of coming up with a deck concept and trying it out (the thing that drew me to Magic) without the same expense and competitive environment.

I'm beginning to think that most of the expansions aren't necessary. After several years, we only play with the base game, Prosperity, and Seaside.

Plays include all owned expansions at the time of the play.

RATING: 7
I figured that this would be a decent enough game, and one that might wife might like.  She loves it.  Which translates into a sure keeper.

Though I can see how the game might grow a little too mechanical and programmed over many playings, I don't figure to have that problem, as I don't figure to play the game over and over hundreds of times.  I am drifting into the "Hates any game that involves castles" category, as I have just played too many games that involve castles.  And though this game is marginally about castles and kingdom building, it is thoroughly engaging.  

Sleeving the game is another problem.  The cards are OK, though they don't have the longer lasting linen finish.  $45 retail for 500 cards seems a little steep, but I suppose that when you compare that to what it'd cost to really get into a CCG, it's not bad.  Still, I guess I would've liked to have seen a bit more put into the finish on the cards, at least to protect from a bit of wear.

Easily one of my favorite deck-building games. Tons of replay value and strategy. Dominion only seems to stagnate when players expect a fast paced battle simulator instead of the  slow and steady building of resources and economies. It can be said that the player interaction to one another is very limited. It grounds itself in its ability to make you feel competitive without directly screwing others over (usually).

I don't quite get the hype about this game. It does run pretty smoothly but that's all. No feeling of immersion whatsoever - you just mechanically calculate your moves which have nothing to do with the "medievel" theme.

The first deck-builder I've ever played, quite by accident, as it turns out. Ran across this game on Amazon and after a quick look, put it low on my Christmas list based mostly on theme. Was sorely disappointed upon going through the box to discover there was no game board and that this was more of card game, along the lines of Magic. Read up on the rules and decided to give it a try with my wife, though I had low expectations. The first game or two were just okay. However, once my wife and I played through all of the recommended sets of cards in the base game and read up on some basic strategies, the game really came alive for us. 

The strategic depth is fantastic, mainly because there are so many various paths to victory in any given game. It's also quite entertaining to observe players adopt various approaches to building their decks and countering the decks of others. The number of completely unique decks which can be built from the same 10 action cards in any given game is quite surprising. The replayability is extremely high, as the number of unique combinations of 10 action cards available per game is simply incredible, and that's just within the base game. I have not played any of the myriad expansions available but they can only serve to increase the appeal and replayability of this game by adding more cards to the, er, shuffle. This game plays fantastically well with 2P, with games lasting about 30 minutes, perfect for an after-supper game or two between my wife and I. I've played several 4P games and they are just as fun, though they can last close to an hour.

The one criticism of the game which I have heard is that players can sometimes feel as if they are simply playing solitaire. My wife and I haven't found this to be a major issue, as the choices one makes when building one's deck often hinge upon the choices of other players. For example, if one or more of my opponents are pursuing a big money strategy and are filling their decks with Silvers and Golds, I would be well served to pick up a Thief or two to take advantage. There are many, many scenarios like this present in the game, to the extent that I have never felt as if I was simply playing solitaire. The one criticism of the game that I do agree with is that there is a lot of shuffling involved, especially early in the game. I would imagine this is true of all DBG's, though.

Since none of us had played this before, it took a couple of minutes to get how it all worked together.  What suprised us was just how solitaire this game was.  When someone was cleaning up, the others were getting started, or meking decisions.  Only when attack cards come out, or Provinces bought, was much attention payed to the current player.

Overall we all really enjoyed it and are looking forward to playing it again.

Logging all Dominion plays under this entry.

It's great, and the expansions add an incredible amount of variety.

Update: I would rate the base game about an 8, but as a whole, Dominion is a 10. I've now played most of the major deck-building contenders (DC, Marvel, Ascension, Thunderstone, Trains) and Dominion is still easily the best. Dominion has explored almost every conceivable facet of the deckbuilding genre at this point and I don't see many ways it could be improved. I like that some of those other games let you play all of your cards on a turn, but it's usually easy enough to get extra action in Dominion. Great game, still the best in class.

First deck-builder I'd ever played, and still basically the go-to game in the genre.  For some reason I find this game bogs down far more often than it should (seeing as basically each hand can almost be played on autopilot), but a decent game if it keeps moving.

This game is a blast...the cards are balanced, but randomly picking 10 decks for a game provides so many variations and after one learning game it cruises along very quickly... very portable when you just put the cards in a box that isn't so bulky.

I have all (through Guilds and one fan expansion) sleeved in two 1600-count card boxes, with dividers for each kingdom set.  Similar to what many have done here.

RATING: 3
Despite all of the acclaim and praise this game receives I just don't find myself enjoying it. In my mind it is the definition of multiple player solitaire that requires memorization of card numbers in your deck.

After playing Puzzle Strike, I have lowered my rating on this game and honestly have zero desire to ever play again. Puzzle Strike proved to me that deckbuilding games can allow for player interaction in a fun and meaningful way. Dominion is merely a thought exercise at the beginning (What cards should I buy) and then hoping luck works out in your favor.

Dull and very repetitive; massive advantage to experienced players as the winner is largely dictated by who can spot the best combos in the card selection before play even begins.

Besides that fact that this is a great game to introduce deck building to non gamers; it's also a great game.  Theme is a little bland but the mechanics are rock solid and keep me wanting more.  I enjoy the simplicity and fluid motion of building my deck as I read my opponents every move.  My group continues to chant EXPANSION EXPANSION EXPANSION!!! as I walk in the room and recommend a play.  Oh and by the way there are plenty of expansions for some reason my submit button never works when I have them in the cart.  LOL...

For the past year, I've struggled to get my family into my new gaming hobby. For me Dominion has been the answer for several of my most stubborn siblings. A few things make it a spectacular gateway game: 

1. No large, intimidating board or components. 
2. You can sell it as "just a card game." 
3. The "click." For learners, there's usually a moment when it all "clicks" for them. This is a great moment for non-gamers. They'll love it and want it again when you approach them about another game.

Thanks, Dominion. Because of you, I have successfully hooked several members of my stubborn family.

Not sure what to say here.  This game is fantastic.  But I haven't played in awhile.  Could the haters be right?  Probably not.  The setup time is a little annoying.

Ironically, I started playing online and it kind of put me off the game.  Made me realize how much better I could be at the game, which made it less fun for me.

Need to play again and reassess.

Obviously an insanely brilliant, wonderful game. It loses a point from me purely because it at times feels very much like a single-player probability exercise; the interaction can be extremely subtle. Also, I wish there were more choices about what to do with your hand, as opposed to simply what to buy.

It's a reliable standby, and the perfect way to introduce friends to board gaming. Not as strategically deep as I'd like, and it started feeling samey years ago even with multiple expansions, but I'm still happy to play whenever a friend suggests it.

I’ve got a little burned out on Dominion. I quite like the game, but games are often decided by luck rather than strategy. The card combinations are quite fun to set up and it can be quick to play with some deck combinations. Unfortunately sometimes the game seems to go on for much longer than needed, particularly if one player is stuck with no real way to get back into the game.

One of the games that got me into the hobby. While I like Dominion a lot, it takes a bit longer to setup than other deck building games I have. I also have mixed feelings about how you typically choose a strategy before the game starts and try to play it to the end.

This ended up leaving my collection because the box was too large to store without playing regularly. These days when I want to play a deckbuilder I tend to go for Star Realms due to the ease of setup.

 What more can be said about Dominion. I used to play alot of Magic and quickly found myself looking for combinations of cards and speed wins. Some games can be not as good as others due to the randomization of the decks.

 I like this as a four player game and find the two player game not as fun.

RATING: 9
I own the Zombinion version from the files section and the 9.5 rating is for that version.

For the original Dominion I give a 7.  I am a fan of zombies and zombie games, but that is not the biggest reason why I have rated Zombinion so much higher. (I think the Galaxy Trucker theme posted in the files also works MUCH better than the original).

Dominion's theme is very, very tired.  I am no longer enthused by medieval or renaissance-aged themes set in Europe.  It...has...been...done...to...death.

Update:  Zombinion is still a 9.5 and I still would not want to play Dominion. 

I don't mind the card shuffleing half as much as the setup and take-down. I swear I would play this twice as much if it wasn't such a hassle.   

But even worse, that theme doesn't even work well in the Dominion system.  The game does feel amazingly interactive even though it does have a large solitaire component to it.  And it certainly is dynamic.  The theme should reflect this.  In my opinion the zombie theme does, the kingdom building theme doesn't.

I would much rather play a "Quick Escape" card than a "Bureaucrat" (QE and B are the same action) card.  "Hide" is actually an action and much more visceral than "Library" (same card).

The Dominion system is unique, engaging and fun, but the theme greatly detracts from the gameplay.  

Update: Downgraded to a 9.  I just dislike the setup so much.



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 2
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 4


Overall - 1.25

This game really is one of my personal gateways -- as a former magic junkie, it got me that MTG fix while showing me what modern board game designs were capable of. That said, it's largely gotten old for me... while I appreciate the variety of decks, I actually dislike that. I'd rather have a game that carefully thought through its interactions and mechanics rather than throwing things in a blender and seeing what comes out (even if what comes out is sometimes really cool in dominion). I'd rather play other things, but appreciate the brilliance of this design.

Disappointment definitely played a role in my perception of this game. After hearing so much about Dominion, its great depth and replayability, I finally got it. When I think of depth and replayability in a card game, R4tG is what comes to mind. Dominion's depth is, well, not very deep. So, if you like the "depth" and "replayability" of Lost Cities (blech!), then maybe this is for you. Don't get me wrong, I don't hate this game. I see some value in it and I will play it more in the future, but it just manages a 6 for me (I had originally rated it at 5.5. Perhaps this will go up a little more). 

I feel like most of the strategy is decided in the beginning and there aren't very many meaningful decisions during the game. I do see a lot of potential. The expansions could add a great deal. But for now, this is a good pick for non-gamers, a filler, or if you want something to play while you're watching TV. There's a little hyperbole in this, but not much.

UPDATE: OK. 12 plays now. This is very easy to teach and a game to which my brothers warmed right up. Due to the likelihood of playing semi-frequently with them and not hating it, I'm bumping this up to a 6.5. I don't think I will be needing to update this again. There's just not enough here for me.

UPDATE: I was wrong. I do need to update this. So, I've played 36 times now and I just can't shake the feeling that this game is pointless. There are several combinations of cards that are going allow you to get 4 Provinces in about 10 turns. Does that make the Chapel better than the Bureaucrat or the Smithy better than the Chapel? Unfortunately, it doesn't matter. Chance is going to take care of that, but since it's so quick, even if you lose you can just play another game! Um, how about you play for me and let me know who won?

I've enjoyed my games of Dominion and it certainly has its addictive qualities, but was not as enamored of it as some in my gaming group.  The variety of the card setup is definitely a plus, as is the quick playing time, but initially it felt like some card combos lead a player to one strategy.  That seems disappointing, when two (or three) cards showing up together means either taking the pre-ordained path or performing suboptimally.

I don't know if it's my change in playing partners or what, but I've been really enjoying the game recently.  Maybe it is the expansions that make other combos more viable or just that I'm understanding the game better after 25 plays and seeing more depth.

Awesome.  Makes me kinda wish I got into the CCG craze so I could appreciate the similarities.  From my non-CCG perspective, however, I see a really cool engine building game at work, and the ability to customize what cards can be used by all players is so cool.  Look forward to repeat plays with 3 and 4, but the 2 player game was good in its own right.

Dominion is pretty much the one game that got me into modern board games, so it's responsible for a lot of spent time and money, but brought me lots of fun times through the several years I've been doing this stuff.

:star: neat, simple ruleset makes this an easy game to teach even to completely new players
:star: keeping all cards available for purchase at all times is a much better system than the central row in games like Ascension or Legendary - it allows for far more strategy
:star: hardly any troublesome card wordings and effects to be seen, and any potential problems are excellently solved by the detailed rulebook
:star: no two games are ever the same
:star: deckbuilding is a super awesome thing, and this game lets you just deckbuild, without getting other things in the way

:nostar: I would've preferred a card layout that let me see more of the art
:nostar: some of the cards are simply unfun (fortunately, second editions are clearing that up!)

As I become exposed to more games, I find myself returning to Dominion less and less. What I enjoy about Dominion is the huge selection of unique cards. This makes each new game an exploration for me. I enjoy trying to find the ideal combos and/or the ideal hand strategy within each 10 card selection. What I don't like about Dominion is that having played with the cards in advance will put you at an extreme advantage over players unfamiliar with them. There are lines and combos that, once encountered, become obvious plays (or obvious things to avoid) - much like chess. Then the game becomes one of study and memorization while the hand plays itself. I have found that card drafting games are particularly prone to this (MTG being the biggest offender). 

I still have several cards I've not played with in my two expansions, so the game isn't dead just yet. I am likely to pick up further expansions to keep the game fresh, but I do not see this returning to my list of favorites without a significant change in taste on my part.

Considered the first of the "deck building" genre this game is alright.

I've quickly been falling in love with this game.  As a long time CCGer who hasn't played in years because the games just got to expensive and time consuming despite my enjoyment, I really feel this game feeds my love of CCGs without the same sort of continual cost of play.  It also impresses me how they made card drafting a game mechanic, when I'm accustomed to it as a meta-game aspect. Very cool!

RATING: 8
Grade: B [05-12-009].  The deck-building is effective and fun.  The variety of cards will help keep the interactions fresh, while also making the core system plenty expandable.  This game seems to be an evolution in design, but only because it game-izes deck-building, a feature of CCGs or CCG-style games that has otherwise been part of the metagame.  It does this well, but I think in a few years other games will have absorbed the Dominion deck-building mechanic.  Will "Vanilla Dominion" still be fun at that point?  Time will tell. 

Score: 8 [5-12-09].  I appreciate Dominion.  Deck-building in CCGs has been an important part of the game, but it's more like doing sprints than playing the game; it gets you in shape to finish the game effectively, but it isn't the game itself.  With Dominion Vaccarino has turned this optimization process into a part of the game itself.  It's a weird sort of backwards innovation.  It ultimately succeeds because it is quick, accessible, has virtually no downtime, includes an astronomical (and sure-to-be-ever-expanding) variety of fairly clever card combinations--all of which make it very replayable.  Optimization is such a feature of Euros that you could, perhaps, say that he has euro-ized the CCG experience (rather than just the CCG).  It works, but I'm cautious about giving it a super high score because I want to see how well it will hold up over time.  I think there's some iteration of this type of game that could be a 10 for me--I'm just not sure someone's designed it yet. For now, though, I'll surely be happy to play the game several more times.

As an old time magic the gathering player, I decided to give this a whirl.   While I like this game, it often feels like I'm playing a dumbed down version of MTG, so I usually opt for other board games.   It's interesting building your deck from scratch..but the downside for me is you're basically building your deck from the same cards your opponent.  This means less diversity, and often the same strategies.

I think I would have kept this game higher had there not been more deckbuilding games that had come out. Dominion is enjoyable and even with the base set you have plenty of options on how to set-up the game. I just think it's kind of dull once you've played it enough times.

Similar to a CCG, or LCG you do most of the thinking outside the game.
When are dealt the kingdom cards you usually know what strategy to go for.

RATING: 8
An expertly crafted game. The only thing keeping me from giving this a solid 10 is the lame theme. 

Also, you have to play with either a group full of beginner players or a group full of players that really dedicate themselves to Dominion. All it takes is one player to study the game and they can run the table at will.

OK, I'm impressed. After tens of plays this game hasn't lost its appeal. It has an amazing replayability mechanism. It seems like this game was built with replayability in mind. It's a very good game to play with just about anyone, and everyone that's been introduced to it was thrilled, from my wife and friendly non-gamer couples all the way up to my hardcore wargaming group. (it's not a wargame oc)

The game is captivating due to the excellent mechanics, flows perfectly well and is the most replayable game I've seen to date.

It is themeless however, and that is a big minus for me. After 200+ plays, after the mechanics (finally) get a bit repetitive, the lack of theme becomes ever more significant.

RATING: 7
Highly addictive card game.  The variability introduced by the different cards and the short play time combine to make either a great filler or, more frequently, invite a series of games.  I did find, however that the base game alone got a bit tired after a while (albeit maybe a hundred plays between face-to-face and BrettSpielWelt).  Despite all the cards there are only three or four viable strategies, two of which (Chapel, Gardens) are based on a single card.  The others (big money, draw as much of your deck as possible) have some variations depending on the available cards, but tend to feel the same after a while.  I have returned with renewed interest, however, after Intrigue and Seaside.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
One of the best card games I've ever played. Excellent artwork, absorbing theme, and the potential for replayability is massive. My only concern is for the long term condition of the cards under such strenuous and repetitive shuffling conditions. The best part about this game is how the cards work together to make massive combos of power. Love the witch and thief cards especially. Great for 2, 3 or 4 players.

RATING: 4.75
Notable in that it is the first deck builder. I found it very unforgiving for new players who don't grab key cards before they run out. Theme is nonexistent and gameplay is not really funner than other deck builders.

It is also a game that I cannot get my head around. I did worse in my best play of Dominion than I did in my worst play of any other deck builder. For whatever reason, I am doomed to end up in far last no matter what I do. I know that the game is about finding a core combo and riding it for buckets of points, but I just cannot do it.

When I tried to build an all around solid deck that has a nice point engine and support cards around it, my engine never came together, my support cards all clumped up and never fired, and I get beaten by an opponent who, more or less, focused on a single card.

When I tried to focus on a single card, my deck ended up an unbalanced mess.

I know that this game is about building a perfect engine and I have seen other players do it, but for whatever reason, I have a mental block around it and don't even understand what I don't understand.

The only reason that I would ever play this game again is out of shear stubbornness about the fact that I cannot be this bad at a pure deck builder.

200 plays.  Not my favorite game, but a game I love which can't help but find it way onto the table. 

My comments and ranking assume at least 2 expansions: Gaming crack.  Addicting, quick, and combos!  I am obsessed with this game currently.  Always thinking what else to do.  Play 15 on, really starting to maximize my strategy.  I have been playing back to back games with identical card sets.  This has allowed to hone strategies and realize "dead end" strategies.  It also helps mitigate the luck in the game, and I think I will be using the back to back game for future sessions.  Love it love it love it.  I have played this with hardcore gamers, family, its been a gateway.  Dominion is a good game to get played in any and all gaming situations.  Its incredible the wide appeal it has.

The base game alone would probably merit a 7, but with at least 2 expansions its an easy 10.

Based upon the card set up available, one must choose the strategy to pursue which means which actions to buy and which percentage of the deck should be actions.   It's just a fun puzzle.  There is quite a bit of luck on turns 3,4,5 which affects the rest of the game.  It is so much fun, it is easy to overlook.  

It has some ridiculous combos which I applaud.  I dislike games which have such neutered powers that they are of little benefit, so it can't be overpowering.  Dominion takes the chance that it can make balanced overpowering combos and it makes the game a lot more fun.  

I create random sets of cards for no reason other than to daydream what my strategy would be.  I need help, but this game is so addicting.

Simplicity, Elegance, Variety, enough luck to keep it interesting, enough depth to keep it interesting, expansions to keep it interesting, really everything i want to keep it interesting is here.  Each box holds 30-35 must play right now and nothing else for me, until it becomes merely a favorite.

I refuse to bring this out, unless time permits to play twice.

SOLD (8/25/11) --- I enjoyed learning Dominion on BrettspielWelt and immediately playing it 12 times in a row the first night, 16 times the second night, 21 times the third night, and 13 times the fourth night, making 62 plays in 4 days. That's saying something as it's coming from someone who generally doesn't like most card games and also someone who almost never plays any game multiple times in a row. It was surprisingly addictive, extremely addictive in fact. Still not sure how much I like it or whether I'll continue to play much down the road, but I do know that I want to keep playing over and over and over at the moment. Very odd and intriguing game...

I can kind of see the lure, and I'd probably get better at it with more plays, but I wouldn't really liken it to a CCG.  It's more a building/worker placement game where your buildings and resources are randomly available.

1/11/10 - I like this better with the expansions.  With the base game there was a distinct advantage for the experienced player (e.g. one who played for 12 hours straight) that could learn combinations.  With the expansions it's harder to just plan a deck on a subset of cards knowing the others won't interfere too much, and it makes it a much more interesting game.

I'm enjoying this game tremendously.  The variety of gameplay depending on which cards are in the kingdom is awesome.

Love it as a 2 player game, but it works really well with 3-4 as well.  Can't wait for the expansion!

This game's entry pretty much solidifies 2008 as one of the best years in gaming ever.

*UPDATE 11/29/09 - With over 40 plays logged, Dominion owns the crown for the most plays logged for me since I started recording them.  I've introduced this game to over 15 or so people, and everyone loves it.  It scales well, has practically infinite replayability, and is fun as hell.  Bumping my rating to a 10.

One of the very first games we bought due to the Spiel des Jahres award and general good reviews on BGG. The rules are simple and concise so you should not need to refer to them much as instructions are printed on the action cards. Seeing all the cards in front of you means you can plan out strategies in advance and knows what's in your deck but chance is added by the necessity of needing to shuffle your deck when you get to the end. With the amount of combinations on offer there is a ton of variety and different ways to win; indeed if you end up enjoying Dominion buying the expansions becomes very addictive; all of them can be combined with each other to produce a dizzying amount of possible card combinations. One of the more interactive card games I have played, the attack cards allow you to irritate the opposition. Only negative is in the downtime created between people's turns; this builds with more players therefore I find this game is best with two players.

Easy to teach card game.  You build your deck as you play, so it's a REALLY interesting gameplay mechanic.  You use the cards in your deck to by more cards, and you discard as you play your hand.

RATING: 7.5
(Rating remains the same as of 72 plays of my physical copy and a bunch on BSW.)

I never thought I'd decide on one favorite game, but this game has become the one.

I am loving this game - it's fun to just keep playing and playing. It's enjoyable to do what you can with the set of cards offered each time. This is a very clever design, like MTG summarized into a short complete package. I like games with lots of options and multiple ways to aim for the goal. I also like the card format. The only downside is having to sleeve nearly 500 cards and being forced to use overhand or hindu shuffle. But I've found that penny sleeves allow for easily sliding one half of your deck into the other for a smooth mix-up.

Best of all, the game is short and easy. I love games like this, and they really fit my current schedule which doesn't have windows of time to play long games.

The decisions are fun, but quick. Downtime is negligible. You shuffle and plan, and it's your turn again.

I like how close the scores can be. I had 4 2P ties in 2 days. The guys in my gaming group are always willing to play. This game has been a delight.

On top of it all, the design is very expansion-ready. I'm looking forward to the new batches of kingdom cards.

UPDATE: While I still rank this a 10 at this point, I have found that what I first loved about Dominion (simplicity, short turns) has been compromised by two things. 

First, many players have become fond of power combos (play 10 cards, shuffle, play more cards, buy 3 Provinces, etc.). This really slows down the game and spoils the fun for me.

Second, Alchemy and Prosperity have introduced layers of complexity that take away from the sweet simplicity of the original Dominion model.

As long as I only use Base + Intrigue + Seaside, and play with quick thinkers, this game is excellent!

UPDATE 5-26-2016:

I never play this game now. Ever since I discovered Star Realms, Dominion has had no place in my life. Star Realms does everything better. The whole package is more satisfying. I would play Dominion if someone really wanted to, but I never choose it now.

I still stick with only the first 3 sets. Lowered my rating from 10 to 7.5.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very good game. 2.player game takes about 10-15 minutes. I like that there are so many different cards to choose, and it really changes the game. 

Althought I like Dominion I don't know how to play it. I have won only 1 game so far, and I have played about 10 games. I have only played 2-player games, and I think that third player doesn't offer anything new in this game, mostly it would only make some downtime.

Rating would be 10, but the theme is crappy and the artwork isn't very pretty.

RATING: 7
The original deckbuilding game with very easy rules but also a lot of replayability and depth. Good gateway game. I recommend that if you like it, you should definitely get couple of expansions since they add so much more cards to play and variety. The reason why I give it only 7 is because it is quite light on strategy when you have played it a lot (experienced players usually go for the same 4-5 cards) and my group has definitely "exhausted" it with probably 50+ games (same with Carcassonne).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is a brilliant and elegant design.  Dominion is the king of the deck builders for a reason, its mechanics are pure and easy to understand.  It works as a gateway game as well as a serious strategy game.  I love it because I can play it with anyone, and it is always engaging the whole way through.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Played this game as part of a six game tournament as well as several times previous. Dominion feeds my CCG needs without the expense of a CCG. It's a simple card based resource management game that's fast to play and can vary greatly from one game to the next. Easy to teach and plenty of different play styles to try.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A fun game! I don't have anything negative to say about it. I like it a lot.  Even with a hand full of cards, it moves right along. I'm looking forward to playing it again.

(Tips: Get card sleeves for this one, as you will be handling the cards quite a bit.)

This game is so overrated in my opinion. The best thing about it is the game play -- it's quick and catchy. The less exciting? The lack of theme -- sure they try to give you one but basically you could play this game with any set of cards. There is nothing immersive about playing it; it all feels very arbitrary. And I might as well whine about the packaging to finish up -- who on earth needs such a gigantic box for what is basically a deck of cards? Fail.

(from my Xmas 2010 post) 
From my kids and wife, Daddy got Dominion. I had tried it a few months back and was really not impressed - seemed to programmed, and the drain-3-piles endgame with 2 players bothered me (why not have fewer cards per pile in 2 player games). But i wanted to try more. So i borrowed the game from the owners of the local toy/game store (Big Smiles - very nice folks), and we tried a few more games. Lo and behold, it grabbed me and i had to have it. Luckily my boy and wife were paying attention. My opinion on the programmed nature of the play boils down basically to: don't be a dolt. (my same basic reaction to Puerto Rico.) If you are playing as an optimizer i think you are missing something in the "playing" part of the game. Have fun, try different strategies and its a blast.

In the end it feels like empty time. 

I'd far prefer a trick taker, for example, THAT kind of thinking and player interaction. Playing cards rather than shuffling them.

I get it's initial appeal, I had that too. And the design is brilliant & well developed. Certainly better than the following attempts at deck building, and I admire the effort.

Undocumented plays > 30.

Good family game with the kids. Can be really fun with non-gamers and played casually, but that also needs avoidance of applying archetypal deck thinning & other disciplined gamer tropes. That starts happening and it turns into an unthinking cred machine & a lack of any drama in the cardplay or the result.

Fun deck building game.  I like the way the box separates the cards for easy storage.  The game plays well and is a race to see who can get the most points.  We play with the ten decks it recommends to start but we are ready to mix and match which is one of the great things about this game.  Looking forward to an expansion.

Played the beta version at Oasis of Fun 2008, looking forward to trying more of this.  Finally played the new release, need to play more to figure out the hierarchy.  Some cards are obviously essential to lead to growth, but which ones is not obvious. Am interested in all the upcoming expansions. (I'm unfortunately not really a big fan of deck building games.)

I have played a few games over the last couple years, but I just don't seem to like it as much as others. Not my cup of tea.

Easy to learn, fun to play.

Edit: After many, many plays(mostly unlogged) I have come to the conclusion that Dominion needs 3+ expansions to prevent it from getting stale. That many should give enough of a card mix that the games don't feel too similar.

More of a game kit - some sets of cards are awful and come down to the first move, some stay together through some reasonable flow. I'm not sure whether I want deck-thinning or not because it needs to stay short.

Probably owes much success to the psychological masking of downtime through shuffling. Setup and teardown take time.

Seems like a better app than a physical card game, with crowdsourced card sets (and cards).

The millions of different combinations thing was always clearly a red herring. Once you develop the heuristics for analysing a set-up (considering how many terminal vs. non-terminal action cards there are, how many cards offer extra buys, etc), rumination over the selected kingdom cards, originally so exciting, becomes the selection of one (or more) of four(ish) paradigms (big money, action chaining, deck thinning, attacking). This applies equally whether there are previously unseen kingdom cards in a set-up or not.

Still. There are games, and there are moments. Buying a couple of curses to end the game. Remodelling a Province into another Province as a tempo play. Many such things. Tricks which haven't occurred to me yet. These sort of things don't come every game. But they feel genuinely skillful when they do.

The diminishing return in buying new Dominion expansions is in more than the ever smaller consequence of a new card in terms of the overall card pool: I've learnt too much about this game, so broadly figuring out the impact of new mechanisms takes less time and gives less pleasure with each new set. I won't buy any more.

downside - don't always care what your opponents do

This game gives me the same feeling as playing MTG but we don't need each player to spend a large sum of money to build a deck beforehand. You can build a unique deck every time and you will because you need to adapt your strategy to what your opponents are doing as well as what is going on with the cards in random play.  The playing field is leveled and you can play with anyone.  Amazing game.  Great, deep strategy.  It's like a Magic the Gathering cube draft but faster and streamlined.

The theme is kind of pasted on and the title of a card doesn't always make sense with what the card does.  It can be humorous a lot of the time.

I once played Dominion base game with a few mates for 18 hours straight. Yes I agreed that 7-8 hours into everything sort of became automatic. With every set we could immediately identify the best strategy and counter strategy. Even with this we kept playing. Once you add expansions if it takes you 50-100+ hours to figure out a game back to front I don't think that's a bad thing. I still have many long Dominion sessions now because we haven't figured everything out and it's too easy to go round after round after round.

So far none of the games I've played have been particularly exciting, and several have been too long. The more experienced players blame all this on the 10-card sets we were using. If there are a handful of boring 10-card sets which we happened to use, then my rating might improve when I use the others. On the other hand, if there are just a few sets of cards which are actually fun to play, my rating will go down.

This one's a 10.  Rated for 2 player, primarily; probably a 10 with 3 and 9 with 4 due to downtime between turns.

This rating is slightly biased in that it accounts for expansions.  The rating is for the idea behind the game, how it plays, and so on.  However, be mindful that without expansions the longevity of the game will be much shorter and will have you wanting more. 

Each expansion exponentially boosts the value of this game and the other expansions that you buy.  Very unique concepts in this game and truly a gem.   

The only con I can really say about this game is that the boxes (with expansions) are pretty large and it can be a pain to pull them out if you want to truly randomize your games.  Then switching between cards from one game to the next can be tiring as well.

*Note, I can't at all agree with the criticisms that the game plays like solitaire.  This game so very heavily relies on you knowing what your opponents are doing and playing around it that.. it's just not true.

*UPDATE 3/6/17: Still love the game, always will.  Starting to feel that the time to set up (take cards out, put old ones away) each game is too cumbersome and preferring alternatives. Changed to a 9.  Great game, just not perfect.

This game has grown on me, largely because of the ease of play on BSW.  It started off as a curiosity, and, with additional plays (now at 154), has become a compelling game with deep strategy. 

I think of this game as an unique game with strategy but without tactics.

Technically, my 11yo daughter owns this, not me.  I've told her, though, that when she goes away to college, she can't take it. ;)

Good:
-Cool card interactions
-Amazing diversity
-So many cards
-Amazing inlay
-Quick game play
-Great expansions

Bad:
-I am a robot (must do X, Y, & Z)
-Follow the leader (Players mimics each other for the first few turns)
-Highly competitive
-Terrible theme
-The winner is too often established in the first couple of turns

Overall:
Another game that is aging poorly.  My biggest grip is that I often feel pigeonholed into certain strategies.  Experimenting typically means losing.  If you are late to the decking building bandwagon you probably want to look elsewhere as there are other deck builders that offer more interaction and/or freedom.  If you already a fan, buy some expansions as they drastically improve the base game.

Juego de cartas en el que construimos nuestro mazo de juego a medida que vamos jugando. La mecánica me ha gustado mucho y la rejugabilidad es bastante alta debido al numero de mazos posibles con los que jugar (Aunque al final siempre acabas eligiendo los que más te gustan). Además es un juego sencillo de enseñar para cuando vienen invitados.

After just one play, I can see why this is a highly regarded game. The chains that naturally develop are the most intriguing part of this game. We just played with the suggested first game setup of kingdom cards and there's so much more to explore. This will be a rabbit hole I see myself going down.

I really enjoy this game.  I like that turns are quick.  You are doing plenty while others take their turns.  You should be checking out your hand as well as watching what the other players are buying.  I feel like I have a lot of control over what happens in the game.  I have introduced this game to non-gamers many times and it always goes over well.  Most always ask, 'What else you got?'  The strategies change from game to game although there will always be strong combos, the existence of other cards add that necessary bit of flavor.  Its also fairly quick to play, at least it feels that way.

RATING: 6.5
Tentative rating after one play with three. Game lasted two hours(!) instead of the 30 minutes mentioned on the box cover, so it kind of outstayed its welcome. I am confident, however, that the game will play much faster the next time we play it, because we now understand that the game is just as much about keeping you draw pile lean and mean as it is about getting the right card combos. Overall, the game is challenging, accessible and a unique addition to my extensive collection. It is just that I would rather play a game with a board if it takes this amount of time.

I am generally not a fan of card-driven games, with the exception of Citadels. So, I am straddling the fence on Dominion. It is a good design, fast paced and short. However, I can see the game getting stale, even with expansion cards. The actions are quite repetitive. Buy cards, use cards, buy cards, use cards...etc. The saving grace for this game is that it is short. Each game can be a short as 20 min depending on the skill levels of the player. Also, the current set of cards doesn't really promote much player interaction other than messing up the hand of cards. Which is why I do like games like citadels. Lots of player interaction. Still, after several plays, I give it an above average score, but I fully expect that rating to drop with more plays.
One note: I feel like this game WAS designed for online play. The computer takes care of all the card shuffling and also the book keeping. THAT is huge especially when 8-10 cards are played in each round. It will get annoying having to shuffle every other time or to keep try of how many actions/buys/money.

After a couple more plays, I am beginning to lose some interest in Dominion. In most cases, I can see that the solitare-esque nature of the game bugs people. There are a couple of really dominant strategies in the mix of the deck and after encountering a couple of those plays, I can see why this game can get boring against novices (the chapel/laboratory combo comes to mind).

0.5 notch downwards.

12/29/08 : Finally played the actual board game version of this game and my thoughts remained the same. This game is best played online. The shuffling of the deck and keeping track of the number of actions/buys is cumbersome. The computer easily takes care of both issues. Played a 2 and 3 player rounds. I have to say this game is slowly losing its luster for me because of its repetitive nature. Giving it another 0.5 notch downward

Core idea is very original and interesting, I really appreciate the design. 

After 30+ plays, I become quite bored with the game though. I very much dislike the setup. I find myself also not that interested to really study all the nuances with different setups. Instead I find myself using pretty much the same strategies from game to game (or if I try something "clever", I usually do badly).

Star Realms fired this game for me. 

The beginning setup and the ending count of VPs all take a little too long for me to really enjoy this. 

Star Realms has none of that, and it's just a lot faster to start and play again. I give this game props for taking the combo elements in Magic the Gathering and turning it into a game. Mind you, the amount that this takes from Magic is not minor.

It still is better than the vast majority of deck builders out there, but I've had my fill and moved on. It's important to note that I'm talking about the base game only. I've never played with the expansion cards so can't say whether the experience improves or not with the expansions. I'm assuming it does.

Update 01/03/15 - Updated from a 3 to a 4 and then back down to a 3 again. I've been playing the expansions online and it's been fun! The fact that the setup is done for you makes it even better. Unfortunately there's still issues.

- Warning: Minor strategy talk ahead - 





I find big money in the base game really boring. Base game dominion is probably a 2 or 3 for me if players just play big money strategies. If all players are running the big money strategy then we might as well flip a coin and call it right there and then.

After playing with the expansions, while big money is less prevalent, it's still a big enough part of the game that I'm not fond of it.

In the 4 years since Dominion was published, it's established itself as one of the benchmark games of the hobby, and with good reason. The compact playing time and excellent accommodation of 2-4 players make this an easy pick for many occasions. But what I especially admire is how accessible the strategy of the game is, even to casual gamers. I've taught Dominion to a wide range of people, and they all "get it" within 5 minutes of sitting down. That doesn't mean they can instantly pick the optimal strategy, of course. But they know what they're supposed to be thinking about, and a lot of Euros take at least a full game to get to that point. Dominion may well be the game best suited to showing off "what the hobby is about" to the uninitiated.

That being said, I find the base game by itself to be a little dull. That's not to say that it's always easy to find the best strategy, only that the cards start feeling ho-hum after a dozen plays or so. The game becomes a lot more interesting and flavorful with the expansion sets, even if you play with only one at a time. By itself, I rate the base game an 8. Throw in an expansion or two that appeals to you and it's a 9.

This game has swallowed large, large swaths of gaming time, perhaps more than it ought.  I don't log my many Isotropic plays on BGG: if I did, Dominion would be *by far* my most-played game, exceeding even Scrabble.

I like the elegance of Dominion.

When I first played, I didn't really get what you were supposed to do.

I think it's a little funny that my husband works very hard at his strategy and I tend to play to try out combinations and have fun, and I usually win that way. Not that I don't play any strategy, especially if there are Gardens in the game.

I think it's a good time, and there is a reason it is already a classic.

My wife and I are new to gaming, so I may have been overly ambitious when I made the immediate jump from Lost Cities to Dominion. I was pleasantly surprised to see her pick up this game so easily. Very easy to explain, one drawback is the setup. While an individual game with 2 people can take 20-30 minutes, the initial setup with new treasury cards can take half that time. Android apps that randomly determine treasury cards are helpful. People will say, "just use the same setup multiple times." However, what I like most about the game is the initial random drawing of treasury cards, as I like thinking out the new strategies that come about with the new setup. Playing the game, I find that we use maybe 2/3 to 3/4 of the available cards, only going for cards that we find to be the most effective. This makes me think that the variety of cards don't actually equate to a variety of paths to victory. In 2 player dominion, I find the race for provinces to be dull and I believe it takes away from playing the different action cards, which I find to be the most fun aspect of the game. The artwork is very nice, the card quality is great, and the card text is very clear which requires basically no explanation. The game pretty much teaches itself. Overall, this is a fun game to play with my wife, which is really what matters most. Not overly confrontational, lots of different, fun cards to choose from (which unfortunately are not chosen because we usually find it better to invest in gold), but the initial setup takes too long, and while I could go down the road of just buying expansion after expansion, I would rather just play a game that focuses more on what satisfies me (the randomness of drawing cards from a pre-shuffled stack is more fun to me than choosing cards already laid out in front of me). I will never turn down a game if my wife wants to play, but something about the game makes me want to find a game that is more completely satisfying.

When it was released, a friend introduced me to Dominion and wiped me off the table. Twice. I didn’t know anything about deckbuilders and I didn’t like it much. 

Now, after playing Kingdom Builder and Trains a lot, I’d like to give it another shot.
So I bought the starter kit Het Koninkrijk Dominion to get a taste of the real deal. I rated it a 7.  

The rating of 6 for Dominion still stands from the past, until I get the chance to play it again.

RATING: 5
A very capable deck building game. One of the modern card/board games that brought me back to physical games but since playing Dominion, I have come across many more games and can safely say, although Dominion is a good game, it is no longer the sharpest tool in the shed. 

What I really like with the game is the calculated risk and even playing field. After a few pilot rounds, you can readily have a decent game strategy put together. Other than the few new mechanics put into the game, such as curses and new victory tokens, there really isn't a very big twist in any of the other expansions.

After several dozen games, I felt that the lustre of the franchise start to wear off. Strategies begin to find it's most effective and efficient form and variation slowly fades into the background. The solution? Randomize what is played, but there is no guarantee there. On occasion, some of the randomization makes for a refreshing new take on the game, but more often than not, there are no synergies and the game could just drag itself out.

In summary, this is a good game to have handy and a great way to introduce someone into the hobby. The Intrigue and Prosperity expansions are a must have in my opinion.

Pros: original deckbuilding game, highly variable initial set-up, limited card market accessible to each player equally, variable strategies, high replayability, easy-to-learn mechanics

Cons: limited player interaction depending on set-up & card availability in the market, little tactical decision-making, harsh strategic imbalances, barely thematic, steep learning curve when encountering new cards

One of my favorites for a very long time and really the game that got me hooked on the hobby. My friends and I spent hours playing this and Settlers of Catan. I own most of the expansions, and have found that the expansions both immensely increase replayability & correct imbalances in the original first edition. There can be a steep learning curve for newbies, especially as more complex cards are introduced. I've recently "grown out" of Dominion (not near as obsessed as I was), but it is still a top contender for bringing to the table on game nights.

Plays listed include any and/or all expansions plus 2nd edition cards.

Run a medieval dominion by shuffling cards. Alot. Interesting and novel game mechanism with respect to card drafting, but the game as a whole left me cold. Some of the poorest theme integration I've seen. Player interaction is minimal. While I see that the deck construction element plays on  edging your probabilities, something I usually like, the part of the game where you play through your deck felt robotic. A few strategies also appeared dominant - I can see how altering the cards would change that dominance, but then you delve in the realm of CCGs of old, where each expansion leads to *new* dominant strategies - but dominant strategies nevertheless exist. Some may argue the game's depth due to the different possibilities of cards being used from game-to-game, but I see that as more of the same - i.e. shuffling different cards. Clearly, this is not for me. Dominion, to me, is an average quick filler that I would never suggest but could play once in a blue moon if in the right mood. Dominion is in a class of recent CCG-like games with deck acrobatic mechanisms, along with San Juan & Race For The Galaxy, that appears to simply not be my thing.

Easy to pick up and understand.  Fun for a small group of players and the expansions allow for different combos and game set-up.  Sometimes combos are too powerful and there is no way to stop it in-game.  Overall, a fun deck building game that can be different every time you play it.

Somehow I managed to almost stop the game buying before MtG came out and completely missed the CCGs (shuffle).

We both want to try this.  Had it been in the stores at (shuffle) the same time we were I think we'd have it already.

Ok, it's here (shuffle).  I think we're both looking forward to a nice slow learning curve together instead of just reading all the blathering in the strategy forum.

We decided to (shuffle) start with the suggested starting game.  After each game, we retire one (shuffle) of the kingdoms, hoping to find a slowly changing landscape through which we can enjoy (shuffle) the journey.

We've started playing (shuffle) random decks now.  We still really don't know what (shuffle) we're doing but it's fun to try something and see how it works.

Oh (shuffle) yeah, I stink, no concept at all of what not to put in a deck.  (shuffle)

This one may well move up to a (shuffle) 10 despite the shuffling.

RATING: 10
Fantastic strategy game for kids 8+, and my favorite adult strategy game -- but you'll soon want to invest in at least 3 expansions: Intrigue, Seaside, and Prosperity, so it will get pricy. 

Dominion is a strategic deck-building strategy game that may be my favorite all-time board game, even though I tend to not play deck-building games. There are now several other similar games that have come out since Dominion, but I love this one and think this is the one to get; and it really builds cognitive and reasoning skills. This one's actually worth spending money on and getting all the expansions.

You choose 10 piles of cards out of over 100 (if you have all the expansions) and so no two games are ever quite the same. Some cards work more efficiently than others, and figuring out the most efficient strategy is a central part of the game. 

Get this if you want your kid to grow up to be a computer programmer or engineer: it has such emergent strategies and makes you calculate and choose among differing scenarios every game that I find it amazing. You're either going to love this game with a passion, or not like it, but give it a few tries, as I had to play a few games before I fell in love with it, unlike many other games where I'm sold on it after playing once.

Again, if you love the game, you want to get all the expansions, but to start, there are two critical expansions to get besides the base game: get Prosperity and Intrigue. Plus get the 6 stand-alone promo cards: Black Market, Envoy, Walled Village, Governor, Stash, and Prince; hopefully you can find them bundled together or at the BGG online store. Those three sets (base-game-plus-Prosperity-plus-Intrigue) and the promos will get you familiar with the game and keep you happy learning the game for months before you're ready for the rest. 

The other expansions you probably want to get in the order they were release, because the makers purposely held back the more complex cards, as the expansions increase in complexity, with Dark Ages being the most complex and confusing in that it alters the game the most. The one exception is Alchemy: avoid getting this one until dead last: don't get it unless or until you have all the other expansions, as it's my least favorite and many players exclude it, or, as I do, just add to their collection the handful of cards that don't use the extra "potion" currency unique to Alchemy. 


 If you buy that first, you may get too confused and give up on the game before you've realized how enchanting it is.

Started deck building with Eminent Domain but my friend was always upset that the game ended just as he was getting his deck to work for him. So when I saw this on sale I picked it up and we have been loving it. Long enough to get your deck really going but not too long that it gets stale. Lots of replay in the original box plus there are so many expansions.

My family, my gaming group and I love this game.  It plays quickly and stays pretty fresh due to the variety of cards, combos and strategies.  I usually play games to win, but this one is fun just to experiemtn and see what a given deck yields.  It's easy for most to pick up and seems to appeal even to non-gemers.  I've played with more than one who have later picked up copies of their won, including my ten YO nephew.  Any game that begats new gamers is a winner in my book.

Dominion is a brilliant and addictive game, expecially with the variety expansions bring. Only after playing a few different set ups do you realise how different each game can be, leading to a huge amount of variety.

Fantastic. Playing with all of the expansions makes this a game that will never get old and will most likely never be played the same way twice. If you have a smart phone, download one of the free apps that gives you a random kingdom card set, much easier than shuffling the huge randomizer deck that builds when you have all of the expansions.

RATING: 10
Dominion is a fast paced game that plays quickly but still requires thoughtful strategy. With just the base set I'd rate this a 7. It's a good game, but it tends to be a bit simple.

It's not the cards that make the game though. While a variety of cards is essential to the format, individual sets of cards can be optimized and almost "solved" but the format is brilliant. The deck building structure can house a potentially infinite number of strategies and systems within it. Potentially a game like magic could be restructured to fit the format.

The only thing wrong with the game at this point is the copyright protection. Because of the strange card size there is no easy way to make your own cards. It makes sense, but it does put a damper on the replay value since eventually there will stop being official expansions.

RATING: N/A
In Dominion, each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards. In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can "buy" as they can afford them. Through their selection of cards, and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players strive for the most efficient path to victory points.

2-4 (best 3)

I like the core idea of this game, but the execution falls flat. A Dominion clone in which the amount of text has been significantly reduced and there is no unnecessary theme and the pricepoint had been lowered, would see my money in no time. The fundamental problem with this game is that it takes too many plays to come to grips with the novellas printed on the cards, and therefore those that eventually do are only those that loved the game enough from the get-go. Make it simple, beautiful, and clear, and you have yourself a family game that could sell really well.

This game should be the #1 game of all time, in my opinion.  Almost every game I play of this is filled with interesting decisions.  

There's a lot of other games that excel with replayability, but none of them to the extent of this game.  It really feels like an entirely new game almost every time I play it.   

Even though the game doesn't boast balance, it is very clear that an enormous amount of work went into planning and tweaking the cards.  I wouldn't be surprised if more hours have been spent playtesting this game than any other game.

I have 275+ recorded plays for this game and its expansions.  I highly doubt that I'll ever have half as many plays of any other game as I do on Dominion.  I'm finally increasing my rating from 9 to 10 based on the quality of the the Prosperity expansion, and my continued eagerness to play the game after 275 plays.

I don't know. I just can't get into Dominion. I'm aware of the positive reviews. I think it's because I don't have any expansions. The base game just seems lacking to me. Additionally, I'm not crazy about deck builders. I prefer each player to start with a unique deck. Everyone starting with the same deck and building it from the same cards seems like a problem in theme. And to me theme is important and a major reason why I like games.
Draw cards, play/buy cards. That's it.

only played base game a few times, very underwhelming experience. I can see how it would have been a great new game when it came out, but having played a ton of ascension on iOs and a ton of Legendary Marvel, Dominion felt very outdated.

[-] it's slow paced (turns can take a long time for not much achieved), don't like the VP card mechanic, keeping track of how many actions/buys/gold you have is boring

I am not nearly as enthused about the game as others are, but I have made my peace with Dominion.  I acknowledge that it has a function... but that function is fairly restrictive, as it's filler for hardcore gamers.  I can't play this with people who aren't hardcore gamers, as the rules and strategy are too much, with not enough payoff.  As for playing with gamers as a real game, it's so short that it almost ends just as it gets going, and my group wants something with more depth and involvement.  Dominion is sorta like gamer junk food.  Even when I can find the right situation, I'm just as likely to ask for something else.  How about [gameid=172] or [gameid=11]?

I've played more than enough Dominion to not care if I ever try it again.  Any freshness was gone after the fifth play or so, and even the deck building mechanic that it pioneered is more satisfying in games like [gameid=69789].  At this point, it is akin to overdeveloped mush, with bland variations on the same pattern, and no amount of nicely threaded turns is going to rehabilitate it for me.  What's more, most of the game is evaluating the tableau at the beginning, and thus the "gameplay" almost feels akin to a gigantic resolution phase.

Deckbuilding is my favorite in-game mechanic, and I appreciate and respect Dominion for what it is and how much it added to hobby gaming. That said, it really does bore the heck out of me. The father of the "pure" deckbuilders (along with Ascension, Legendary, Cryptozoic's Cerberus engine games, and Thunderstone), it stops short of actually doing something with the creative mechanic: gathering estates and provinces just pales in comparison to fighting monsters and superhero/villains.

-) Addictive.
-) Easily expanded.

CONs:
-) Some cards seem clearly more important (powerful) than others.
-) Luck of the draw is far from negligible. 
-) Tiebreaker is not enough of a compensation for the advantage of playing first.
-) Annoying costant (re)shuffling.
-) The important info on the cards could have been printed more clearly.
-) The artwork is unimpressive, when not downright bad.
-) It'll have multiple expansions.

This game floored me. I normally dislike "card" games, but Dominion stands out. We were taught the game in just a few minutes, got a hang of it in 10 minutes, and then played several games. We did not want to quit. It will take new players a while to learn what benefit each card offers, but each card is not complex and is not overloaded with information. My rating will most likely go up after I purchase the game and play it more often. And buy it I will! My son loved it and I predict that my wife and daughter will love it.  
My rating went up to a 9! Great game.

Dominion without expansions gets a 7, the base game struggles with being a bit boring by itself. I just don't get excited playing it. Would generally rather play a game with deck building elements/mechanics included, vs a pure deckbuilder. Dominion + expansions (or as a game system) gets an 8.

A mai napig legjobb... vagyizé, legismertebb pakliépítő játék! Célunk olyan kiegyensúlyozott pakli építése újabb és újabb lapok hozzáadásával, ami gyorsan pörög és eközben tempóelőnyt ad nekünk, valamint "elbírja" a győzelmi pont kártyákat, ugyanis bár a játékban ezek semmit se érnek, a végén csak ezek határozzák meg a győztes kilétét.
Három féle kártyád van: akciólap, pénz, és győzelmi pont. Minden kört öt lappal kezdesz, majd végrehajthatsz egy akciót és várásolhatsz egy lapot a kezedben lévő pénzen. A lényeg persze az akciók kombinálása, mert azok újabb akciókat, laphúzást, plusz pénzt és vásárlást jelnethetnek. Nem mellékesen a már nem kellő lapokat érdemes egy-egy akcióval kitenni, ami által "sűrűbb" lesz a pakli és nem minden 4 rossz kézre jut egy jó, hanem akár fordítva.

RATING: 9
Rating is given after 50 games, and with over 20 wins the game is getting better. :)

By the rules, it is quite simple game, but each card breaking the rules, makes it more challenging and harder. The aim is to collect points and you need to build your deck in the meanwhile. Actions, money and points are all cards, you need a good combination of all in order to make your deck work and have the most points in the end. Changing the setup (and expansions) greatly affects the re-playability, which is nice. Feels like a good, balanced game.

Playable with 2, 3 or 4, so it is very flexible in that sense. With Intrigue it is possible to have 5-8 players, but the downtime gets quite high even with 5.

I have now played couple of times with the cards from the expansion mixed into this game. Really hard to say anything hard of them, but at least they give something new to the base game, extend it's life, but still don't break the feeling too much.

Updated after the 57th play (1st with Adventures): The elegance of the original Dominion gets quite lost with expansion like Adventures, but happily it is possible to choose the expansions you like. Still a good game.

Updated after 5 duels with just the base game. First two plays were a bit longer, but last three were played in 15 minutes each once the opponent learnt the rules.

Two duels with random setup, the plays are no longer because of new cards and different setups.

Three duels with random setup (same for each three), this time the setup was fast, so 15-20 minutes each. Good.

Add 10 more duels, and I decided to update the rating from 8 to 9. I was surprised how easy this was to teach to newbie and how fast she learned to properly play. The game is very fast, 10-15 minutes a play nowadays.

It's a hot game and I've always been a fan of CCGs. This takes the concept of the card environment and turns on it's head. Your card selection is constantly changing rather than MTG or L5R where your card pool slowly increases over the editions. It makes for a lot of fun decisions even if the net user interaction is rather low.

A deck building game where you try and get various combinations of cards to work best for you to gain victory points.   In some respects it has a similar feel as Race for the Galaxy, but where RFTG feels clunky to me, this game feels intuitive and plays smoothly.  A very fun game that is not hard to teach and plays fairly quickly and interactively - depending on the cards that are out, of course.  Highly recommended.

As a very lazy, uncomitted Magic: The Gathering player, this game looked like a decent way for me to do some fun deck-building stuff without having to keep spending money on heaps of cards.

I enjoyed this one a lot for the first 10 plays but have since found that 1 or 2 occasional plays satisfies me for awhile. It feels too much like I see my hand and run on autopilot. Despite this the game is challenging for me because I never have a good "feel" for my deck's composition. Excellent design and the expansions do add some cool new stuff, but it just doesn't grab me.

I prefer 2 player Dominion (less down time).

This box was so cheap. I paid only 6 € for it. (Plus 15 € for the sleeves.)

When I found Dominion from a local online second hand forum I had never played it before. I knew nothing of it other than that according to the internet it was a good game. I had not even bought any proper boardgame sleeves before.

Thus Dominion is one of the first 'adult' gateway boardgames I've bought myself. ("Myself" since my family had already gifted me for instance 'Carcassonne' and Rainer Knizia's 'Ingenius'.)

That year I played Dominion a lot. I took it on the vacations with me and made custom card separators for it. I still play it but nowadays I don't take it to the trips. It's too big to carry in a backbag on the train even though I store the cards in a smallish cardboard box that once belonged to 'Carcassonne: The Princess & the Dragon'.

Dominion has a place on my shelf because it's an easy game to intruduce to all kinds of people. : )

This is basically MTG where your hand size is 5 instead of 7 and you buy cards to fill up your deck instead of summoning monsters and..... anyway, I like it! I'm giving it a 9 for now as I've only played the basic setup. *update 12/31/08* I've played 4 of the 5 setups (all but Size Distortion) from the back of the manual. The game plays great with any number but I'm liking the two-player the best so far. I'm updating my rating to a 10. The game sets up quickly, plays fairly quickly and I like shuffling cards. *4/2/09 I'm lowering my rating to a 9. The base 25 actions is starting to grow old. The shuffling is tedious. I'm making a chip-set Dominion and the expansion is coming soon so these factors may just raise it back up to a 10.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great, modern classic. But after a few plays w/ my deck, I got a digital version and kind of burned out on it. The issue with base Dominion is that, if you're a gamer used to more complicated games, you feel a little unfulfilled with the base set after a few plays. I was in a position where I had to decide: Double-down and get a BUNCH of expansions, or sell/trade to get into a different game? 

I chose the 2nd option after buying Tanto Cuore which is basically Dominion+ for my wife and I, with a much more interesting theme.

Вобщем я не могу назвать достоинства этой игры. А недостатки - пожалуйста:

1. Много раз надо тасовать карты (я не люблю)
2. Сложно следить что делают другие. Наверное это лечиться если хорошо изучить все карты (т.е. привыкнуть к ним)
3. Сам процесс игры основанный на построении колоды я не нахожу чем-либо занимательным.
4. Новичку плохо, т.к. надо изучать карты, которые обладают не самыми простыми свойствами, и еще сложно научиться сочетать их в колоде.
5. Я вообще не нахожу карточные игры наглядными. Может быть потому что у меня не орлиное зрение, не знаю.

Race for the Galaxy мне также не нравится, но если выбирать из двух, то я бы выбрал RftG.

PERMANENT PLACE IN COLLECTION

Needs expansions to be good. The base game has three winning strategies and they're obvious on second play. Once you've discovered them, the game gets tired very quickly. It's very strategic and, thus, dull once you understand the best strategies in the set.

With expansions, this game is a 9. It's simple and quick-to-play with huge strategic depth. The card combinations and complexity increases exponentially, but the rules remain simple and elegant. A brilliant game design.

Don't buy it if you use theme to learn to play. I enjoy playing Dominion, but am learning the expanded game through teaching matches against my husband (who plays online). The game is very mechanical and the theme has no relationship to the cards. 

That said, the artwork is very pretty and the card stock is the best I've seen.

What a great game!  I suck at it, but it is a very well rounded game.  All of the strategy is in what cards you buy and WHEN you buy them.  It is smart to break up your strategy into 3 parts: Early game, mid-game and End-game.  It is also good to find cards that will combine well with others (i.e. modifiers and special cards).  The suggested sets are a good way to go.  The "randomizer deck" can make the game slower and less interesting and some cards don't work well with others.  This game is great for 2 players, it can also range up to 6 players, but the most I've played was 4.  Turns can get long, but I think this game is great.  Another thing is that the more you know the cards, the better off you will be.  Also, if you can't get into medival theme stuff, this is not for you.

Wow, this is one crazy-addictive game.  Remember that first time you played Fairy Tale, and you got that itch to play it again and again because of the drafting mechanism?  You know, where you wanted to play it again right away?  Well, say goodbye to Fairy Tale and hello to Dominion, because you may never come back to the former once you've played the latter.

Aside from being cardboard cocaine, the game also shows the multiple playtests and the amount of development put into it, so it's going to be a finely tuned machine.  There's something very satisfying about building your own deck and timing when to make the shift from money and action cards to VPs.  This game is challenging, versatile, and requires a different approach depending on what cards are in play.  It's also nicely balanced to be "just" a card game, and the number of cards and the method for choosing the cards in each game will guarantee that the game will have a long shelf life.  

I've heard complaints that the game can feel deterministic, since with each hand you draw, you'll have a single best way to play the hand, but for me, getting to the point where you can have your deck doing what you want it to do is pretty fun.  If you're not a fan of deck-building, then it won't be for you; otherwise, just get on and enjoy the ride.

Late to the party. I tried Dominion a few years after it was released and like so many other former Magic-junkies, I instantly fell in love with it. I've heard that the first phase of I ALWAYS WANT TO PLAY IT will fade and that it won't be able to hold a player's interest over a long period of time. We'll see. With all the expansions, I think it will last a long, long time. Edited 10.08.2015: The first phase did indeed pass. I have little interest in the game these days.

I had doubts about this one, but it is quickly becoming one of my favorites and a go to game. I thought the shuffling would be tedious, but it is not bad and keeps you active.

This is just a lot of fun, watching your deck build and seeing the result of the combos you created is a blast. See my review.

rated down to 9 as it gets old watching someone draw and play actions what seems forever, depends on the deck and cards in play

Dominion was our "first" and thus has a special place in our heart. However, we keep coming back to Dominion after having explored and enjoyed plenty a new mechanics and themes, and Dominion just keeps blowing our minds. So simple, so versatile, so elegant, so rewarding, so much fun. Dominion remains our absolute #1.

It's interesting, with nice mechanics and some fun. You can make a super-ultra-combo with lots of action cards, and it's nice to think ahead. The randomizer is the best thing of this game, it's never the same game (strategically). But I hate the necessity to buy victory points to win. It seems to me it should be another way to finish this game...

I will not be buying any more of the boxed expansions. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a way to acquire stacks of individual cards. Ordering promo cards is the closest thing to buying singles in Dominion. 

Decided against [gameid=125403] - looks like it encourages engine building. Alchemy, Guilds, Seaside, and (especially) Prosperity seem to over-complicate the game. I also don't like the flavour of several of their cards (e.g. Colony and Native Village). Adding tokens spoils the base game elegance of only needing cards. There are similar games, with better gameplay. However Dominion has wider appeal, especially amongst my friends who don't play games.

In Dominion, each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards. In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can "buy" as they can afford them. Through their selection of cards to buy, and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end.

Hmmm...I don't know that I love deckbuilding.  I can't seem to get a handle on how to pick up cards that work together as powerful combos.  As far as deckbuilders go, I think this offers a lot of variety with the different combinations you can make with the Kingdom supply categories.

It's addictive, and like Magic, relies on expansions to ensure its continued depth. The pattern is pretty much the same each time a new expansion is released: play some exploratory rounds, figure out which cards are viable, then degenerate into playing the same few overpowered cards each time. The game is obviously most fun in the exploratory stages, and can get pretty stale after the luster of new cards has worn off. Still, the game is amazingly fun while it "lasts," and not too bad even when you have "solved" the game. 

Unfortunately, after burning through a bunch of expansions, I'm kind of burned out on the whole thing. I'd much prefer it if the dev had spent a long time making one really good set of kingdom cards rather than a an endless array of crappy ones.

Dominion takes the deck building aspect of collectible card games and makes a game out of it. Initially, I was underwhelmed. I thought the concept was an absolute homerun, but the actual gameplay was a little dull. It almost felt like I was playing half of a game. I've built a deck...now shouldn't I do something with it? My initial lackluster feelings have improved quite a bit though, and I feel a little better with each new release of the game's fantastic expansions. They've added a lot of interactivity and many of the new cards are far more interesting than the simple +1 action, +1 gold type cards of the base set. To make a long story short, Dominion has grown into one of my favorite games and I can't wait to see how it continues to evolve.

Favorite card game so far.
Love the mechanics so much that I don't even care about the lack of strenght in the theme. Some cards just don't fit into my idea of the game theme is (like Curses, and Witches - what the fuck is wrong with realism, people? Would it kill to make Curse curds "Poverty" or "Unhappiness" cards?), but the gameplay is so fun I have to play it everytime I can. 
The expansions add a lot to the game (Seaside and Intrigue), but I don't think alchemy was a good idea. Have to check it before I judge it, though.

I do play it a lot at BSW, so I put 100 plays in the profile. Have yet to try the complete expansions (have only played with excerpts from them).

Card game favorite até agora.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great game.  Simple mechanics, fast play, but a little intimidating and an abject lack of theme.  Questionable gateway-value and accessibility.  Seems overly predictable; I may revise my rating with further plays.

EDIT: 5 plays have dropped this from 8 to 7.5.

EDIT: 30+ plays including base game and expansions have dropped this from a 7.5 to a 7.  Accesiblity and variety has increased as I pick up expansions and learn to teach it well, but that can't fully correct for the straightforward  and repetitive objective.

A deck-building mainstay. Unfortunately, it may have become too familiar and too much an exercise in solitaire. We can power through games in 20m, such that your next turn is beginning nearly as soon as you've shuffled and drawn up. Good starter or closer game.

The deck-building mechanic is genius, and I've come to appreciate this game much more after a few dozen plays now that I realize that there's not necessarily a single dominant strategy with any given set of cards (at least, not at subtournament levels). When teaching the game 3 times in 2 days recently (using the First Game suggested setup) I used 3 totally different strategies - and won all 3 games. The short playtime is also a plus. The biggest downside for me is the setup time if you're only going to be playing one game or with mass market-type gamers, but overall this is one of my favorite games.

The quintessential [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/tag/deck_builder/user/Vroenis]Deck builder[/url].
Hand management.
Medium weight for beginners, light with mastery.
Low level interaction (The Intrigue expansion increases it).
Low theme application for the most part.

One of the most fluid deck builders created. Core cards are great for new groups with fewer complex cards.
Those with mastery will have to take it easy on those just learning for at least a few turns, as veterans will maximise efficiency much quicker. Still, it's an easy game to get the hang of and develop good deck management skills.

Sometimes you'll draw five useless cards which won't be fun - it's rare, but it does happen a time or two. The good thing is the game cycles quickly so before you know it, it's your turn again. Then you may have an epic 9 card combo with two buys and score a high VP card plus something else useful. Little direct interaction can mean little banter, but you do pay attention to what everyone else is doing, their card distros (as best you can) and charismatic players will always be able to amp things as there's plenty of opportunity.

RATING: 8
Update:  I'll fess up that I've played over 500 games of Dominion online with a couple of friends.  A friend has purchased all available cards and we play with random decks.  I won't play anywhere other than online since setup is instantaneous and card rules are baked into the interface (no mistakes, no mulligans).  With experience the game has become much more cut-throat and also more varied as new approaches are regularly tried.  I really enjoy the challenge of the on-the-fly deck-building and deck-culling (if there are cards that allow it) to create snowballing combinations.  My rating is for online play.

8/14/2013:  [bgcolor=#9999FF][s][color=#9999FF]-[/color][/s][b]6[/b][s][color=#9999FF]-[/color][/s][/bgcolor] Too dang many cards to learn.  And my eyes no longer enjoy closely reading small print.  The interactions of the cards are also reminiscent of Magic the Gathering which kinda turns me off as I have totally burned out the MtG torch.

Hate building a deck in front of my opponent.

[q]I don't like how it implements the theme. I mean, you pay gold to hire these heroes and they don't show up! You get a Militia man with three torches, and a sword he can't even lift. This is a fantasy game if Dilbert's pointy-haired boss invented it.[/q]

Thanks for the review of Thunderstone, Sam and Max.

However, with Dominion, there is ZERO theme here. Nothing. Nada. Zilch. Zippo. Nothing. It is the blandest of the bland. Blank cards would be a better game than this.

Then, just as you say in TS "they don't show up." In Dominion, they don't show up either. If You get gold and victory point cards only, you can only buy stuff and end your turn. most victory points wins.. What?


[b]You literally assemble a deck and the game ends... So, you built a deck to.. Build a deck??? You don't do anything with the completed deck?? What? I have a complete deck now and you want to count victory points?

WORST GAME EVER!!![/b]

Though Dominion introduced the idea of deckbuilding games, the vanilla set relies on that system alone, and as far as I know includes no cards that require you to acknowledge the other players.

As a former [i]Magic[/i] player, I love the combo-licious appeal of [i]Dominion[/i]. Not only are you looking at each hand to see what to make of it, but just as you make control, aggressive or combo decks in [i]Magic[/i], you can create a deck in [i]Dominion[/i] that has a particular playing style.

For the first few games, you’ll be buying willy-nilly, trying things out to see what happens when you draw card X, Y or Z, but with experience you get a sense for which cards work well together, which cards to buy when, what percentage of your deck should be Treasure and which kinds, when to transition into buying Victory cards, and so on. Cards that initially seem stupid, weak or useless become must buys in later games once you realize how powerful they can be in the right circumstances – a term which is shorthand for you being on the wrong end of a thrashing.

Well lets get this straight, this is in nowhere the same league, hell not in the same universe as MTG. But neither is it probably meant to be. Bizarrely for a game with a gazillions different combinations the variety really isn't there as all the cards are of very similar ilk and do a limited number of the same things. Having said all of that its still a very good game and one I'm always happy to play just isn't the killer game it seems to be made out to be though fair kudos must be given for it inventing its own genre

Alone with just the base game it gets dull very quickly though so a few expansions are a must. I just wish all the expansions fit nicely into the game and expanded it rather than having little extra bits that kind of sit to the side without really 100% gelling with the whole

A flawed masterpiece

CCGish in ways that I dislike: fussing over exact deck proportions, finding power cards and perfect combos, and (thus) hyper-tuning a subset of an already small subset of cards. Also adds a new annoyance: crazy amounts of shuffling. And missing are some things I love about CCGs: highlander-ish making the best of bad sets, hand-management and in-play dilemmas (vs. all focus on deckbuilding), and the possibility of surprise. It really is like turning Asperger-esque Magic deck tuning into a competition.

So I should hate it, but I don't. I do wish all the above were different, but it's not fair to judge the game for what it isn't. What it is is a fairly solitaire-ish, front-loaded, programming exercise, with some hard choices around what to include and when to time the switch from building an engine to collecting points.

The base set is the worst. Several expansions open the game up more, and broader is better for this one.

Also, Big Money is annoying. Buying a couple of action cards + money is just too strong a default strategy. Even experts note that it has a non-trivial win rate, even against competent players. Also, each expansion has chipped away at BM, sometimes blatantly, which I really doubt is a coincidence (and is great for the game, but I do think it points to even the designer tacitly acknowledging that BM was a bit too strong out of the gate).

RATING: 3
Dominion was my introduction to deck-building, one of my favorite mechanisms, but even the first time I felt something was lacking. Then I played a lot against the computer and now I tried it again IRL.
Here's why I never want to play it again IRL:
- Some cards just make it very fiddly and have a long downtime while offering no interesting choices.
- Deckbuilding provides escalation and fast gameplay. Dominion sometimes does that, but not reliably. (see next point)
- Random setup in theory means infinite replayabity, but in practice means lots of horrible or at least boring setups and most of the cards are pretty similar and the ones that aren't are usually incredibly fiddly or not efficient.
- While Dominion is strategic in terms of what's available to buy, it has an insane luck of the draw aspect. Lot of the cards only work well if drawn with other cards. At some setups if your starting 2 draws are 5 and 2 money, you essentially lose a turn, and you can easily lose the game because of this disadvantage.
- But in the end buying VP cards is just such a letdown. It's fundamentally uninteresting. The part of the game I like is pulling off combo chains, but that is insanely luck-dependant and sometimes isn't even as good as just buying money cards.
- It might seem like it, but you don't really have to have some kind of balance beetween engine building and buying points. At some point you just start buying points and that's it. It's not even really a dramatic or interesting choice when to start doing that, you just start when other players do, and you'll effectively see that way whose deck is better.

I have none of the expansions and do not want any of them - if I want to have a deeper deckbuilding experience, I'd rather buy a different game than expanding this one.

Dominion was definitely an awesome experience the first time I played it. However, the deck-building mechanic has since grown stale to me. I will still play games of Dominion on occasion, but it's not the first game I am going to suggest.

You are a monarch, that wants a bigger and more pleasant kingdom,  you want more, you want a Dominion! Each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards. In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can buy. 
When you use a card it goes back into your desc, so you have to construct  your deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to victory points by end game. You select 10 of the many card types to include in any given play, making each game very different.

[i]Rating for the whole Dominion system:[/i]

If I were to limit my collection to just one game - this would be it. I can't express how much I love it. It's infinitely replayable, extremely addictive and you can tailor its complexity level to just about any type of player you happen to play with. 

I love the dynamic, fast-paced gameplay and the clean, elegant deck-building mechanism. Finding the perfect combination of cards and creating the most efficient deck is a fantastic puzzle, there's a whole world of strategies only waiting to be discovered. I could play Dominion all the time.

[i]I own the following expansions: Intrigue, Seaside, Prosperity, Cornucopia, Empires + promo cards: Envoy, Prince, Black Market, Sauna/Avanto, Governor, Walled Village.[/i]

Amazing game.  This is effectively a collectable card game without the collecting cards or the overly complex rules. Games can play very fast (sometimes) and there are so many cards that every game plays very different depending on the cards you play with.

RATING: 6
The set up time is not too bad as compared to some economic Euros and has a great deal of replay value.  Constant shuffling is a bit annoying and the endless combos can get ridiculous.

RATING: 7
Shine has pretty much come off - it's a relaxing, "autopilot"-style game.  The ability to do deck-building in-game is deceptive - once you get past initial play,  it's probably better to plan your deck-building beforehand...so really heading back to offline deckbuilding.  Not a mechanic I'm enamoured with,  but I can't deny that it is an innovative design. Can sometimes go too long for what it is (in my mind it should be a 5-10 minute filler), especially when it ends 3 card stacks being empty.

Simple rules that leads to a quick strategic game.  Pretty straightforward increasing economy/switch to VPs mechanism.  Game can drag if you end up in a situation where getting 8 gold is tough/impossible,  and you have to exhaust piles.  The shuffling is only a bit annoying in real life,  although the setup before/sorting afterwards is a bit more annoying.  

It's a little irritating to play someone who's trying a similar strategy to your own (when they're buying the same cards as you) - starts to feel that luck of the draw is more important than skill.

Actually,  it feels a bit like tuning a computer program on the fly - those "battling robots" kinds of competitions,  but with the ability to add in parts as the competition goes on.

Juego con una mecánica muy interesante, donde vas gestionando tus cartas de dinero y puntos de victoria para comprar otras cartas que agilicen tu mazo y te permitan comprar lo máximo posible en cada turno. Muy entretenido, las partidas suelen ser rápidas. Es un juego que se juega muy bien a 2 jugadores y a 3 es perfecto. Más de 3 puede hacerse un poco pesado mientras esperas tu turno.

What I Love- 
meaningful choices, building efficiency, the feel of progression as you shape your deck into a well oiled machine. Quick play time. Big turns. Near infinite variety of kingdoms and replay value now that I own all sets and expansions.Simple to teach and play, but still strategic. Skill testing, manageable luck. 

What I Dislike- 
depending on the kingdom, some waiting on other players big turns. Getting buried in curses or ruins,(you almost always have to fight fire with fire in these cases). Limited ability to change strategies mid game.(but that's always your fault when it happens)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
To my mind, one of the essential modern tabletop games, and certainly the most ingenious response to CCGs. Burnout is real -- in midlevel play it's an analytically demanding game, and early/midgame plays can seem rote -- but you can play a hundred great games without repeating yourself, which is (1) great value for $$$ and (2) an impressive feat of design.

Bonus: For a time, Dominion was one of the only games that consistently brought our *entire* friend group to the table, not just the gents. Vital!

Played the near final prototype at Gencon.  This is going to be a huge success.  I think it will appeal to the same people who like Race for the Galaxy, but it is easier to learn, and has more inherent variability.

I have heard the argument that the theme in this game is "pasted on", or thin and irrelevant.  I guess I can see this point of view, but it honestly does not detract from my enjoyment of the game.  Its a decent game for the non-gamer as well.

This is the one that really got me into boardgaming as a hobby. I'd gone to Gencon for years playing collectible card games (WWE Raw Deal in particular, also a little L5R) but in 2009 I was looking for something new to refresh my faith in gaming. Dominion was it.

I had heard in hushed whispers about the game and every other vendor booth had sleeves FOR Dominion in particular so I decided to seek out a demo. Played it and bought it and Intrigue on the spot.

Since then other deck builders have come up through the ranks (Ascension in particular) and even though Dominion has lost a bit of its luster, I still respect it for what it is: Solid game with an innovative mechanic that I can easily teach and enjoy playing for hours. Great game.

This game is not a good as some people say it is! The reason being that you collect cards to build your deck, but you don't feel that you're building a city/ civilization, which I believe is the theme here? The theme is not coming through for me. I feel like I'm collection cards with a goal, to win, I'm not collect card to have a great city or civilization.
There are much better deck builders out there! 
But all in all this is a fine light game, I think it would be great for new board gamers just to understand the deck building mechanic.

My ratings for Dominion and the expansions are for the individual games. I'll easily give it a 10 as a combination of at least three games / expansions. For me it gets better with more cards as I like figuring out new tactics more than trying to optimize something I've already played several times.

Settlers of Catan was my first non-mainstream game. This was the first non-mainstream game that I truly loved, that showed me that, yes, games can be this fun and this exciting.

It's kind of like owning an aquarium.  The level of interest in the game comes and goes.  It's really enjoyable when we play it, but we quickly forget about it when it's on the shelf.  Yet, after a number of months we return to this game.  Overall, I wouldn't trade it, as there is a smoothness to the game, and an easy-to-teach factor to it that makes it an enduring favourite (even if we forget about it sometimes!)

Update:The revised cards further sharpen the game!

The variety of cards and different strategies that can be employed makes this game quite flexible, and I've found that it appeals to a wide range of people.

Certainly enjoyable. I am never particularly good at the whole "building momentum" or whatever. So I enjoy this game and can possibly win on occasion, but I still haven't got the hang of the basic strategy. I collect VP too early but am learning the value of $$$. I like the mechanic of not actually "spending" your cash so much as discarding it... it takes me a while to get used to but it also forces me to purchase since there's no need to "save" money for later. I love the variety in this game, that makes each game different. Overall, great, lots of fun, would play again and again, but not a particular favorite.

One of my favorite games, this game is amazing. It can be extremely simple to incredibly complicated with lots of strategy mixed in. Everyone that I've taught this game to, loves it.

RATING: 7.5
This is a really fun game and great for new gamers.  While there's really only one way to get points and win, the fun comes from balancing your deck and reacting to the other players.  Turns are quick and the game doesn't take too too long, which is a big plus.  And the large number of Action cards to mix and match makes for a different experience each game.  I haven't played the expansions, but I can see how they would really add to this game.  I do feel it can get a little old after repeated play, but it's great for new gamers and a good one to pull out if you're short on time.

Build a kingdom by building a deck of cards.  This game is entirely a card game, where players all start with a weak identical little deck of 10 cards and try to build it into the best deck, Cards to buy include victory point cards, money cards, and action cards.  Some action cards attack other players or steal from time, but most just give bonuses during a players turn.  The neat feature is that victory point cards give no benefit during the game, only at the end, so picking them up early is actually to a player's disadvantage. Great game.

Well integrated theme, re-playability, fast pace, easy to teach, great artwork, expansions, storage system integrated into the packaging, custom community rules...  This game has it all.  It's at the point now where I really don't even want to play other games.

I can't wait to play 8 players when intrigue comes out.  I'm just way too excited about that expansion.  I'm also waiting anxiously for my Black Market and Envoy cards to arrive in the mail.

Artwork is dire. Looks like VHS grabs from medieval films, 'matissed' to pixellate a bit in photoshop - I'm seeing this cheapo approach quite a bit in game art now. must try this to save cash in my future designs!

RATING: 6
In my opinion this game suffers heavily from the upkeep required to play. You rarely have the ability to watch what other people are doing as they lay out 5-6 cards in a turn. Overall this game just isn't exciting for the amount of time required to play.

Nearly all of my complaints are negated by playing it online. It would jump several ratings if there was a seperate "online rating" category. I can forgive it's very few flaws online due to the 5-8 minute playing time.

RATING: 10
The variety of set ups for this game make the replayability amazing.  Each game plays completely different, and when you combine that with such a short play time 20-30 mins per game, you get a lot of play out of this game.  I like to say that it contains all my favourite elements of MtG without breaking the bank like MtG.

A classic game that's kind of lost its cool factor over the years. I bought it in 2012 when a lot of people seemed to be falling out of love with it.

I would also get Seaside for more player interaction and Prosperity for bigger stakes.

RATING: 7.4
A very decent game but pretty much themeless. It's nice that there are different cards that you play with in different games but it feels like it lacks diversity of options. Expansions would help this but I don't think I like it enough to want to spend a decent amount of money on it all. Partly because it just doesn't feel special due to lacking  meaningful theme.

Played this as a 2-player game and found it almost perfect!  It's quick with very little downtime.  It has a nice balance of luck (card draws) and strategy.  The replayability seems like it will be good, with the different sets of kingdoms you can play.  And it's fun.  The only slight criticism is there is not much interaction - unless the militia or witch card is played.

RATING: 4
Dominion is an undeniably clever card game in which players use action (“kingdom”) and money (“treasure”) cards to buy additional action cards, additional money cards, and victory point cards.  The basic idea is that newly purchased action/money/VP cards are eventually re-shuffled back into the deck; as a result, each player’s deck steadily increases in size and becomes increasingly more powerful. When the game ends, the winner is the player who has the greatest sum total of VP cards in his/her deck.

Innovations notwithstanding, my rating of Dominion is uncharitably low due to (1) the game’s reliance on a criminally insane amount of card shuffling, (2) the extremely minor extent to which players can exert any direct influence over other players’ strategies/actions, and (3) the chaotic, indiscriminate nature of the few direct-interaction cards that exist in the game. (Caveat: I haven’t seen the entire span of Dominion's game cards.)

Regardless, gamers who enjoy "parallel play" efficiency/engine games (Agricola, Race for the Galaxy) will find a lot to like in Dominion.  I have no doubt that many people will enjoy playing Dominion countless times.  For me, a couple of times was enough.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a great design. You have to build your hand from the available cards on the table. First you try to increase your deck and later try to switch from building the deck to adding victory points. With 25 decks to start with and only using 10 per game there is a lot of replay here.

RATING: 8
Had you asked me to rate this in 2010, I would have given it a 10.  This was my gateway drug and the reason why I'm into hobby board gaming today.  It taught me that one person could spend 40 bucks and play a card game with up to four people an infinite number of times, and have as much fun, if not more, than if that same  person had dumped their life savings into an ever-expanding CCG. Its deck building concept was novel then, and still holds up to this day.

The only reason I rate this a 8 these days is because I'm not always in the mood to play it.  I've expanded my horizons, and while Dominion still holds up and deserves a steady place on the shelf as a classic, I have moved on to graze in other pastures.  I will say this:  I have yet to encounter a mechanically better deck-builder.

Deckbuilding is a really interesting idea, but it feels a little pointless in this game I guess. You get cards that let you use more cards that let you draw more cards that let you use more cards (repeat a thousand times) then reshuffle every 30 seconds. Well... it felt too mechanical for me.

As a former MTG player, I miss creatures, combat and spells. Plus the fact that your only objective in the game is to put a lot of useless cards in your deck makes this game the opposite of fun for me.

If I ever want to play a deckbuilding game, I'll be happy to play Ascension or even Friday... Not Dominion.

PS: Ohhh, and for the love of god, WTF is wrong with the art of the back of the cards? Geez that's probably the worse card back art I've ever seen!

Great game for everyone willing to go a little further than classics like Monopoly and Sorry. You can quickly teach people how to play because cards are clear and rules quite simple.

Good deck building game. 

Relatively simple to teach to new players, only 3 main mechanics in the game.

I always want more player interaction in these types of games, but it just doesn't seem to happen. Deckbuilders always feel like a bunch of people playing the same game separately while taking turns. I never really care or watch what other players are doing because I can't really do anything about it.

Still holding as our #1 deck builder. (Although trains is gaining).

The mechanics are so simple, and with the insane number of kingdom cards across the expansions you can make the game as simple or insanely complex/interactive as you want.

Have played all counts from 2-6 and have more or less always enjoyed myself. Definitely the place to start if you're looking to get into deck building.

RATING: 8
Interesting mechanics, though i can't say i really liked chain constructing. My first play was very untraditional, i was making only 1 action at a time and buying points from the start and then depleted one card stack to make the game end. And i won. Also it is not very interesting to watch someone doing long chains. It is not very entertaining. Well, maybe after more plays and with more sets my opinion will change. Constant shuffling is PITA and you are forced to get sleeves for this game. After playing more sets i will give it another +1. Different strategies and tactics are interesting.

Having played Dominion twice, I don't feel like there's much more I want from this game. I now understand the mechanics, but the theme, such as it is, appears irrelevant to the game, leaving little more than a puzzle to be solved. fair enough if you like solving puzzles, but it's not for me. Some of the additional cards would keep the interest up, but not by much. It plays well and smoothly, though, and passes the time,

Good quick game with good mechanics, but sometimes feels a bit "dull" (pasted on theme?). No real tension (other than some cards interaction and being aware of the other player's strategy), as each player is busy building their own deck engine. May need to play more frequently to appreciate the different cards and expansions.

2014-12-22:  I've played many a deckbuilder since experiencing Dominion.  I still enjoy the game and would like to play with some more of the expansion cards.  I don't see myself playing this with experienced gamers anymore since there are better options.  I will still play this at home with the family as it is "just right" on the difficulty scale.

2010-02-04:  I like this game a lot the first couple times we played, but it just kind of fizzled out for me.  I would still like to try the Intrigue and Seaside, but other games keep beating them to the table.

The game is not hard to learn, but there is a noticeable skill disparity between those that have played this game a lot and those that have not. People with experience in this game can regularly crush new player without breaking a sweat.

The game has almost no direct player interaction, except for the occasional attack card or what not. I have not problems with that, but I know people who don't like playing 'multiplayer solitair', as they would describe it.

Deckbuilding is a fine idea, and I suspect the success of Dominion has more to do with this process as opposed to enthusiasm for a game that actually works. The static board is a huge problem; all the combinations and possibilities don't mean anything when there's a best strategy on the table and it's available to everyone. When you purchase Chapel and pass the turn, the next guy has exactly the same options; nothing has actually changed about the board. And if players are pretty much in agreement on the best strategy, turns tend to look very much alike. With any given pool of ten cards, once you determine the optimum build, players start the same and have the same options so is it any wonder they all do the same thing? Thus, turn order and luck of the draw becomes integral to winning.

RATING: 5.5
I don't know about this game. I like the idea, love the concept, but somehow it doesn't click with me like with others. There are a few problems with it:
1) Setup: isn't in 5 minutes 
2) Game flow: beginning goes quick, then usually becomes a drag because the game takes too long and it lacks some sort of climax at the end. It just ends, player count their points, the end.
3) It feels a bit linear to me. It suggests to be a simple game with loads of depth and variation once you play it, but it isn't. It's exactly what it is. Combo's and interaction are limited and not very interesting.

Played it quite a few times now with 3 people. I did get to like it more, but it doesn't get nowhere near the level it is on BGG :)

So i guess this is not my kind of game. Still ok and somewhat interesting to play though.

RATING: 7
One of the originals of the deck-building genre and one the original games in my collection that I have played to death. The variety, quickness of play, and the ability to interact with other players or play your own game makes this a lot of fun. While I wouldn't say that I have a strong desire to pull this game out all of the time, its not a game that I would necessarily turn down either.

Not that an expansion is necessary given the potential combinations that come in the base game, I could see myself buying an expansion down the road just to add a little more life back in to the game. I could also see this being a potentially fun family game when the kids get older as well.

As it currently stands, and the fact that my wife also really enjoys this, it is a great game and one that I'll hold on to for the foreseeable future.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.8
Great Game! Usually won't turn down a game, but best to be played with people who have a good understanding of it. Otherwise, it gets too slow. Best games I've had were using all the attack cards, or limiting the money/action cards!

Deck building. This was the one that started the deck building trend. To this day, this game is STILL good and STILL fun. Such simple turns. Theme? Ehhhhhhhhhhhh okay, so their is no theme really. All the cards show medieval peasants and ... villages... I guess. But that is my only negative on this game really. I still enjoy playing and I would consider this another classic everyone should own.

RATING: 7
This game have a lot of things I love, constructing decks, different strategies to win, victory points, limited interaction with other players, and, of course, the most important reason, everyone have the same cards. It's not the more you pay the more you win, like Magic the Gathering, here it's only your own ability to make a winning deck. In this game you have also the luck, like in Magic, but it's a more limited factor. And you don't need to buy the expansions if you have the basic game. The not so good aspect of the game are the irregular illustrations, some are good and another ones are creepy and horrible. 

Este juego tiene un montón de cosas que adoro, construir mazos, diferentes estrategias para ganar, puntos de victoria, interacción limitada con otros jugadores, y, por supuesto, la razón más importante, todo el mundo tiene las mismas cartas. No es eso de que cuanto más te gastas más ganas, como en Magic el encuentro, aquí sólo cuenta tu propia habilidad para hacer un mazo ganador. En este juego también entra la suerte, pero es un factor más limitado que en Magic. Y no necesitas comprarte las expansiones si tienes el básico. Lo malo del juego son las irregulares ilustraciones, que van de las buenas a las más horribles y extrañas.

Despite it's popularity, I did not like this game as much as I would love to. While I enjoyed the deck-building and the customization, I just felt that there were not enough meaningful decisions to make when taking your turn. What you can do with your hand of cards is pretty obvious and you do not really have to make any tortured decisions. After a while, it felt like the game was playing me. I can understand how many love this game though.

The first of the deck building games. Terrific concept, loved it at first play. 

Each player starts with the same 10 cards and from that must build a victory point machine. There are 10 different cards as well as higher denominations of coins and three levels of victory points. You use the coins in your starting hand (initially all low value) to buy higher valued denominations of coins, victory points or cards from the center. Those extra cards give you extra buy actions, extra options to play cards or draw cards thus allowing you to do more during your turn.

Very impressed after first several games. Making the meta-game of deck-building into the game experience itself is both novel and incredibly compelling. So far all the games have been very close (if not score-wise, then turn-wise, such as "with one more turn, I could have done XXX for the win!").

I found the base set was great at its time of release, a very innovative, and exciting game, even approachable as a family game with casual players. That quickly went out the window with each expansion adding more to the game, but still leaving it a mechanical, and strictly theme-less game. Now there are so many extra boards, of various sizes, and shapes, along with a variety of silly tokens. The graphic design, and art direction has always been poor: the logo is horrible, the card back doubly so, the art style is so divergent from card to card that it ruins any attempt at a theme, and it features an overall just boring look. The gameplay feels bland, very mechanical, like a test of concept, and not a finished product. It has definitely been surpassed by many newer games since, where deckbuilding is used in more thematic ways.

It's Dominion... not super grounded in theme, but it's the original deckbuilder.  Fabulous mechanics and tons of variety when (like I have) you invest in lots of the expansions.   It's not always the best for player interaction, but I think it's not as solitaire an experience as many people claim.

I enjoyed this quite a bit with the wife.  It is like a faster paced Ascension.  There isn't as much to keep up with like in 7 Wonders or Ascension since you only get victory points from the Victory cards.

I may change the rating after a few more plays, but it seems like it would be a lot more fun with more people.

[b]BREATHTAKING![/b]

Superior to Race for the Galaxy or any other deck churning, engine building game I can think of. Amazingly good.

Would rate this game a "10" if there was more player interaction. That said, I'm not overly happy with the interaction there is at present. I certainly don't enjoy the game as much when the set-up includes "screw you" cards, and no Moats or moat-clones "counterspells" to deny that bitch-slap strategy. What I mean to say, is that I like cards that poke your friends in the eye, ONLY if their is a counter tactic available, and not just one that optimises your own deck hoping not to get walloped.

If the trend for this in our games continues, may rating will plummet.

UPDATE: Dominion has earned its place in the throne-room. Played with alarming regularity at our gaming meets.

RATING: 6
Playtest (provisional) rating: My recommendation is to avoid the hype unless you are keen on being underwhelmed by this at first.  Game has a subtle depth if you are willing to allow the time to explore all that it has to offer.  I enjoyed my plays thus far, but do have some reservation in terms of its polish and the interaction between some of the cards.

Update #1: Raised my initial score by 0.5.  There have been some real nice combinations that I've tried which really make the game a lot more interesting.  There are still a handful of cards which seem to be lacking.  Plays quick, even faster than Race for the Galaxy and that is definitely not a bad thing.  Setup and tear down is a pain though.

Update #2: Due to the specific cards involved in the last couple of sessions, the gameplay has evolved from racking up as many points as possible to giving out as many negative ones and ending the game soon after.  I've found this dynamic to be a lot more fun and if Dominion continues to allow different objectives to win, I think it will be an even greater success.

Update #3: Honestly, I just don't have any real desire to play Dominion these days.  Keeping track of all of the actions and buys you've accumulated each time is such a burdensome task to do.  I also don't find it enjoyable to try to determine the ultimate card combo.  Much like how Magic over the time devolved into merely a deckbuilding exercise instead of playing the game for fun.  Except it took Dominion less than a year to become a bore for me to participate in.  The only good thing I can say is that it's relatively easy to pick back up, so the familiarity is still there, for the moment.

Dominion is a fantastic deck building game that provides an extremely huge amount of variety to the game. 

Update 02/03/13.  I still enjoy the game, but I would say not nearly as much as I used to.  So I am going to downgrade it a bit.

Played the prototype at Origins.  Pretty non-existent in the player interaction department, but still some interesting things going on.  I think people are so enamoured with Dominion because it's unlike anything currently out there.  But why not just play a dead CCG?  Then you can do all the deckbuilding you want without it actually being the main mechanic of the game.  All the shuffling gets annoying, too.  I'm not sure it's worth the effort... UPDATE: Played 2 more times, once with a different setup.  I like it now better than after my first play, but this is still not a top tier game for me (unless there are cards I haven't seen which make the actual gameplay a whole lot more interesting than what's there now).  Update #2: The more I play it (especially with random setups) the more I like it.  It's addictive and multiple games in a row can be common (especially playing it on BSW...in fact, I prefer playing it there, as it eliminates setup and shuffling ;)).

Dominion is... not terrible. I think, by this point, this game is one of those deck builders where it founded the genre, but has been slightly left behind for other deck builders with more notable mechanics. Look at games like Eminent Domain and the Alien and Predator deck building games! Look at Friday! Each of these games presents something fresh and interesting to the genre, and lasting. Dominion just sort of feels old at this point, a lot like Magic. Yeah, it founded the genre but I feel at this point, it's been done and done again, and done better elsewhere. It's not terrible, but just not terribly exciting.

Great game.  I know that there are better deck-builder games out there.  But this one just has a great level of simplicity that makes for a very enjoyable game. Best with 2 or 3 players though... with 4 you can sometimes feel like there is too much down time (with certain players who can't decide on their card purchases...).  the .25 I took off a perfect score was due to the lack of interactivity between players in the base game.  But, similar to other LCGs, [some of] the expansions add some fun interactions that fix the lack of interaction.  To a point.  
Like playing a great game of solitaire.  But against people who can screw you over :)

The first time I played it, I immediately thought about sleeving all the cards and succumbed to WeDESIGN (Which Dominion Expansion Should I Get Next?) syndrome. But after 5+ plays it started to feel a little light and samey, for me. Its one of my wife's current top 3 games. I like it as an occasional filler but I think I need to get one of the expansions to see if I need to rethink this rating.

When it was a prototype under playtesting and development:  Can't say too much yet, but constructing a deck for maximal efficiency as you play is challenging and addicting.  It's easy to find yourself playing this several times in a row.

Now:  This game provides interesting choices and balance as you build a CCG-style deck on the fly, with victory points acting as dead weight in the deck.  Brilliant!

I was browsing for new games and found that year's Spiel des Jahres which happened to be Keltis.
Reading descriptions and reviews on Amazon I quickly figured I didn't like it. But one review hinted towards Dominion being a far better game.
I got it and was fascinated while reading the rule book. The deck-drafting mechanic was a great idea (you can see it counting new games that have implemented it).
What should I say? I've never had any issues in 3+ players games. There might be balance problems but all cards are available to all players.
1vs1 was a bit too much on the luck-reliant side for my taste.
The game is not perfect (low player interaction) but it sure is fun.

In addition, the box is awesome: It can hold all sets of cards individually and they won't mingle with each other even when turning the box upside-down.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
So, after one play, I think I know why a lot of first games take so long.  Both my wife and I had no cohesive strategy, so we were just buying whichever cards sounded good.  I think planning ahead on how you are going to create your deck will help eliminate a lot of the extra cards that don't really help.  This in turn will help you buy more valuable cards quicker as you can actually have a hand with a decent amount of money.

Update:  I've played this a few times with my buddies at work and am undefeated so far.  :)  I really enjoy picking a strategy and running with it.  Of course, I'm always tempted to deviate as we play...

A couple things that annoy me:  The spare cards need to have a background that is easier to pick out from the rest of the cards.  Why are there spare VP cards?  The treasure cards need to be colored differently (i.e. Gold, Silver, and Bronze).

Update: Taught this to the in-laws and it has quickly become a favorite.  While it took me this long to figure out some good basic strategies, My mother-in-law has picked it right up.  I think that is one of the appealing things to me.  It is easy to pick up, but you can really dig into it.

Update:  Playing with the Witch especially is not a good idea with people who don't like nastiness.

Father of deck builders. I like this very much. Games are fast and fun. If you have many of the expansions, the set up can take a while if you plan to randomize set up from them all. Basic game can be enough if you plan to play only here and there, but we found out that this needs expansions after awhile. I recommend only to get a few that you like and stick with them, so the set up won't frighten you away.

Excellent concept and totally absorbing when played on the PC. Bought the base set because of that, but the real thing played on a table hasn't satisfied me nor any other friend I've played with: too strategy without game (most decisions should be taken once the kingdom is decided) and too "solitaire" (doesn't benefit much from having your opponents in front of you).

I may have a problem with deckbuilding games in general, as I don't actually enjoy building my deck as much as I enjoy building a tableau, for instance... probably it's because I can't visualize well the evolution in the state of play with dbgs (cards are drawn, used, and discarded).

Update: after trying Nightfall now I know that my problem is not with deckbuilding, but with games that only offer deckbuilding.

RATING: 6
After 20+ Plays: After my first play, I was in love with this game and had to have it right away.  After about 20 games, though, my love has begun to wane.  The games are feeling a little same-ish, despite the variability of the setup.  It seems that though there are ten cards, the best style of deck is determined by the best couple of cards available, so there are actually fewer significantly different combinations of cards.

My other problem is that while building your deck is fun and gives you several strategic options, there seems to be a real void of tactical decisions.  While you to decide what to buy, the actual functioning of the deck is generally obvious and follows the same script.  This is probably why it is a good gateway into ccg type games, but it lacks the depth of games like Race for the Galaxy, which offer multiple strategic paths as well and interesting, and often agonizing, tactical decisions. 

After 50+ Plays: I think the expansions really improve this game.  More than the diversity of set-ups they make possible, the cards are just more interesting.  There are fewer set-ups that can be beaten by a simple silver then gold then province buy progression, there are more incentives to diversify your deck, and there are more interesting decisions to be made during the rest of your turn.  I'm keeping my rating for the base set at 6, but my rating for the game system as a whole would be about an 8.

Dominion is a fun card drafting/ deck and hand management game. 
It has a solid 6 for the time being as it is sorely out classed by newer games. 
The open market card pools lead to samey decks from everyone at the table and can lead to snow balling for whoever calmed the optimal strategy first.
the reliance on +action +buy and draw cards in this game is harsh, leading to some long games with bloated decks no matter what you do. 

All in all there are cards that are musts from the base set so it still gets its score but many of its cards are out classed in the expansions.

chances are that you have a friend who has most of this game and you'll need at least 2 more people to play so I would advise against buying any of the sets and going for a cheaper more fulfilling drafting game like Star Realms.

When it comes to Dominion, I had never played a deckbuilding game before. I had my doubts, and couldn't find myself enjoying a card game. Dominion erased all doubt after the first play. I didn't play once that night, I played three times. It's a blast. Every decision is rewarding but strategy is deep, as well. There are multiple ways to win, but as the games goes on, there is a time where you better adjust or make it work. What a fantastic mechanic. The theme gets better the more you play and understand the game, as well.

The grand-daddy of deck building games. Players start with a small deck of currency and must buy cards from the central supply to add to their deck. Cards include Actions, which do stuff, Treasures, which buy stuff, and Victory cards, which are useless apart from their points at the end of the game. Hundreds of cards available across the expansions, easy to learn with an ocean of depth and nuance.

This game doesn't have any staying power with me, unfortunately.    

The people who introduced it to me had 100+ games of Dominion under their belt, and I lost by only one point in the first game, and thoroughly beat them in the second.  That never happens with me, as my win:lose ratio is usually fairly evenly split, or on the side of losing.  I believe it's because I quickly picked up on the probability manipulation intrinsic to deck-building, and, without any more to the game, I found that that was all there was to it.  Thus, since I *do* like the deck-building mechanic, I've found that Thunderstone: Advance (and retroactively adding the earlier expansions) is a much better fit for me.  There's more to do, and I enjoy the dungeon-delving adventure.

Have played only a few games yet, so nothing too special to say about this... yet.

Tu reino (mazo) consta de cartas de tesoro, PV y acción. CAda ronda cuentas con 5 de estas cartas para efectuar acciones y realizar compras. Cuando se agoten 3 tipos de mazos se acaba la partida y el jugador que haya comprado más PV habrá ganado.

As already-mentioned in the Ascension comments box, I have very limited play experience with Dominion, but right from the get-go, I was kind of fascinated and disgusted by some of the possibilities the kingdom card assortments can offer... 

Some of the cards seem like almost "auto-includes", and once everyone's decks become pretty tuned, turns seem to go on forever with all the card drawing/replacing/manipulation and multiple actions.

I still think I will enjoy playing the game several times, since it should take many games before even the most basic combinations and strategies become too obvious and the game starts feeling like auto-piloting your way to victory (or a very cool version of solitaire)...

EDIT:
Having played it quite a bit more, I've come to the conclusion that it's basically a solitaire game where you compete against other players' scores. Basically no interaction whatsover, symmetric decks, unbalanced cards...

The concept is amazing, I just think there are better deckbuilding games out there, now.

Igazán gyors deckbuilder. Két nagyobb volumenü játék közé tökéletes levezetés.

Probably overplayed this and it's lost its magic a bit for me now, but so much variety and depth in a game with such a simple rule set makes it a true feat of design

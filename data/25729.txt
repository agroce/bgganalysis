Oh how I wish I could play more games of this glorious system. Unfortunately a hypothetical WWIII isn't something many gamers want to play, and being a tactical system means there are usually other preferences (Combat Commander, ASL, take your pick). 

Alot of fun and really suits tournament play.

Very good game from LnL, streamlined fewer rules (contrary to other titles from LnL) and total tactical mayhem, quick battles, small map (pretty much on each other's face from move 1), far reaching artillery and range combat etc. and so things can change drastically from one turn to next. This is not a very simple game as it still has some fiddliness to it (to cater for edge cases etc.) but overall a lot easier than your average war game. Luck of dice roll can change the game drastically since units can die fast. The rulebook I thought was not a good intro to the game system but after a few games I can say that I found it rather concise and to the point providing explanations to various situations that I encountered and so overall the rulebook leaves very little to interpretation.
I have the deluxe edition and components are of good quality my only gripe is the size of the counters (small) and by extension the font size which is much smaller compared to say the counters of Conflict of Heroes. So a lot of eye strain and on my first game I missed a whole set of turns for Russians "moving & firing" units as I couldn't see the underlining. Overall a great game and a worthy addition to anyone's collection, just make sure you use a magnifying glass if your eyesight is not that strong, great job LnL.

This is an excellent game system, which is easy to pick up and which plays out well. With simple but elegant rules one can focus on the strategy and tactics, not on checking the intricacies of the rules. Highly recommended!

Giving this another shot as I wasn't so impressed first time around, and that recently I'd picked up compendium #2 and counterattack expansion very cheaply. Played intro scenario and first impression was just how difficult it was to pick up the counters! Will report back later with game play impressions.

Right. I suppose I should quantify this. I play games solo, that's a function of my time. I like games which have complexity, which make me think, ponder. This I would gather would be great to play with friends. But to me, soloing this, I'm bored by it. In my opinion the generic units,  uninteresting scenarios, the use of a map that isn't of anywhere in particular, put this on the selling table. 

You however, might love it.

What more could anyone ask for? Attractive components, simple yet elegant system, modest footprint, eminently playable.

There are some very nice touches that simply but effectively deal with subjects that other games can get bogged down with, HQs and assigned weapons, side stepping the need for hidden deployment and making the game even more solitaire friendly.

The values on each unit contain the information for its AT, HE, assault, and movement capabilities. Combat is handled with a combination of range, firepower (dice to roll), to-hit numbers (modified by range for HE and AT, but not for ATGMs) and for all but assault there are save rolls (varying number of dice and to-save numbers based on armor for AT fire and terrain for HE). It sounds fiddly but it become second nature very quickly, and there's enough scope for unit differentiation in the values to keep even a grognard happy but without getting bogged down in minutiae.

The real key to the system is that each side isn't just a bunch of platoons, but formations (battalions for the Soviets and company teams for the US) that are activated by a chit pull system. The US quality shows in each formation having two chits to the Soviet's one - but there are game-turn end chits as well so that means nothing is certain.  

As each formation activates, it gets to perform operations (move or fire) with its units one by one, with units that are stacked getting getting to move and hence overrun or assault together. A few units are capable of moving fire, and you can always stay put and threaten opportunity fire later on. 

It's this combination of larger formations and individual operations that make the Soviets dangerous once they get close to the US units, as even the most powerful US units become vulnerable to repeated waves of assaults within a single Soviet activation - but the butcher's bill can be high, and with the first loss being a disruption (followed by a step loss, then elimination) it can take a while for the Soviets to rally their forces back to state where they can move on as they have at most one activation per turn, lower morale that the US, shorter command radius, and larger formations to rally. 

The US needs to use their more frequent activations to use long range firepower and manoeuvre to hold the Soviet hordes at arms length, whilst the Soviets must use covered approaches and artillery to get close enough to the outnumbered US to overwhelm them.

All told, this is a very impressive game. It accomplishes a great deal with very little in the way of rules and no CRTs, and yet there is a richness and depth to the game second to none. This is a game that deserves to be the Panzerblitz for the new millennium. It raises the bar sky high compared to its predecessors, and should be on every grognards bookshelf - and every gamers table!

RATING: 8.5
This is  a nice tactical wargame at the lighter end of the wargame spectrum. The rules are fairly easy to digest at just 7 pages and while there are a number of exceptions you will likely have them ironed out after a solo game. I think the combat system really works very nicely. Allowing the hits and saves to be separated as different die rolls works very nicely and adds a good bit of tension. There's a lot of info packed on the counters but you quickly get used to it. And all that info translates into lots of real world differences between the units that you normally wouldn't see in a quick playing game like this. Command and control, armor, weapons, doctrine, etc. all come into play in each game but the system keeps it simple to grasp. The low unit density with light rules makes for a fun, quick playing game.

Very well thought out system... easy to learn and plays fast.  It would have gotten 10 points, but I feel that it could have had more than 6 scenarios in the box... sure, it is probably easy to make ones myself but I feel they could have gone to 10 or even 20 fairly easily.  Still, I do really like this game.

RATING: 7
very nice. Easy (sometimes, too easy) and ready to play. 
It is not a wargame for experienced players since the rules are very very minimal, but this is also the reason why an experienced player can enjoy this game as "relaxing" game. 
The map is nice, the counters are well done. 
The players don't need to always look up the players aid cards since most of the information is already on the counters.

This game has the worst counters of any game I own. Its bad cardstock combined with very poor cutting (not even straight cuts but curved!). The glued-on paper started to peel of immediately. The matte finish looks cheap.

I guess they will work well with DTP expansions like counters from LoF.

Technically, based off the info for the ratings, I'll give this a 10.

I actually did enjoy this game very much.  It was quick, fun, and interesting.  The mechanics are also very nice, but I'm interested to see how it'll scale to when I have more formations available.

There are a few issues that I have, that don't make the game bad, but do detract from it.  The counters I got were off-centered- this makes it REALLY hard to read some of the stats (like the ranges for the T-72's guns).  The rules are a little difficult to pick up and read, in my opinion, but by no means impossible.  

I do think what the rules give you IS very nice though- a fun, dynamic, quick game that depicts the hypothetical war of this era.  I think it'll be interesting to see where it goes from here- there's a lot of possibilities for this style of game, and if it expands, I think that would make the game even better.

Looking forward to more expansions (and trying out the one thats out!)

The rules are short and not comprehensive enough, hence the need for an extensive Q&A.  In our first game, we couldn't play without Internet access because one crucial issue was not covered in the rules:  What happens when you shoot at a stack of units? Are they all affected or do you target only one?  Thankfully this was addressed in Q&A compiled by a player, but I had to take a point off for frustration.

The components are beautiful, but beauty has its price:  There's only a single map, so replayability will be limited.  There are too few informational markers and they're thin and difficult to handle.

Other than the above qualms, it is still a good introductory hex and counter wargame.

initial rating after first play.  Pretty clear rule-set + great setting equals a good time so far.  I wouldn't call this an introductory war game but it would make a great "next step" after something like Hammer of the Scotts and Memoir 44.  Certainly easier than ASLSK

RATING: N/A
Platoon-level system with emphasis on activation by companies (US) and (primarily) battalions (Soviets).  Looks like a nice clean fast-playing system, with more thought behind unit values and interaction than might initially be inferred.  Beautiful counters, nice solid map--map's as thick as old Battleline counters, and it looks immune to warping.

Fast & Deadly. This game is a blast to play. The chit-pull system ensures, you will be biting your nails every turn. It also, makes for wild momentum swings, in which you may find yourself on the brink of ruin one turn only to emerge victorious thanks to some lucky chit draws and dice rolls. My rating may change, I need to play more FtF with this.

RATING: 9
I'll second the comments about fast, easy, and fun play.I don't generally like chit-draw games, but the way they're used here - the Americans having multiple actions for smaller units compared to Soviets (fewer actions for bigger units) seems to capture the doctrinal differences in a more elegant way than the old Assault series.

I wish the counters were a bit bigger, because every number you need to play is right on the counter (no charts - awesome!)The map is simple and elegant, and very sturdy.

The only rules I didn't like much were the HQs rules.  Seemed a bit fiddly, but maybe after multiple plays I'll modify that opinion.  For now, this is a fun and fast system that captures some pretty tense battles.  One of the things that makes the game play quickly is the way all the necessary numbers are on the counters (very handy).  A game we all wish we'd had 15-20 years ago.  Looking forward to future expansions.

RATING: 5
What I thought would be a quick-start game turned out to be more cumbersome in details that I thought.  The rules were unclear in a few places and seemed to contain too many specific, "if this then that..." situations.  In that regard, I think a weapons effectiveness chart would have been helpful, as well as a game flow summary/mechanics table and unit summary/capabilities table.  Also, there are not enough counters to support the scenarios, ie the 4 HE Firepower missions in Scenario 1.  Hopefully the next revision can address some of these issues.

A simple, easy to learn set of rules for a quick, fun, balanced yet challenging game. In many ways it reminds me of the Panzer Blitz/Panzer Leader/Arab Israeli Wars group of games but is a whole lot less complicated without losing the essentially chaotic nature of late 20th Century mobile warfare. I became an instant fan.

Nicely done game on a topic that doesn't get enough design love. Very good production values. A bit of slippage in the die-cutting, but nothing to shout about and the publisher seems more than willing to replace any sheets that are egregiously screwed up. Rules are clear and compact, game play is engaging and intense. I'm particularly impressed by how well the 10 pages of rules seem to capture so many of the complexities of contemporary tactical warfare. A few trade-offs for playability, of course, but overall it's great stuff.

A very good game on platoon combat in a World War III scenario. The game plays very quickly, usually in a few hours. Low counter density and combat is fast and furious.

After two plays, it feels like an updated, streamlined, and more exciting version of the old Avalon Hill tank battle classic, The Arab-Israeli Wars. However, I am not a fan of the design decision to reverse half the E's and R's on the headers of the rules and player aids. It's a definite distraction when trying to read and use them.

Fun beer and pretzels game of hypothetical WW3 battles in Western Europe.  I enjoyed the chit pull mechanism immensely and the dice heavy combat system works well.  At three plays so far I think the Americans have an uphill battle in the first two scenarios.  The less experienced player should play the Soviets.

I look forward to more plays and hope to try out some of the larger scenarios.

I am looking forward to more.

I'm really impressed with this game.  Visually great, very nice counters, and a beautiful mounted map (only slightly thinner than a standard mounted map, but it lays flat without plexi!).  The mechanics are simple, and it has a combat system akin to Tide of Iron or Heroscape (attacker rolls for hits, defender rolls for 'blocks'). 

There is a decent amount of chrome packed into just 8 pages of rule (and more importantly, densely packed on the counters).

A solid low/mid complexity wargame.

A couple of solid face to face games have let me settle on a 6 for this.  It's fun to play and fast moving.  The rules are light, well written and easy to understand.

However, see my comments on "Nations at War: White Star Rising", which is nearly the same system, and which I played much more of.  It has *some* of the same issues.  But for some reason, in the setting of this game, along with the fact that there ARE some differences in some key mechanics, they don't seem to be nearly as much a problem (or maybe I just haven't played it enough).  All in all, it is the best game on this topic (tactical warfare in Europe in the 1980s) that I've played, but there were still many things that I found I didn't like.

RATING: 8
The counters in this should have been of a higher quality. They are on the thin side, which is a shame, as I like the look of them a lot. They have a lot of information packed on them, but that information seems to be set up in a logical manner that would become second nature after playing with it a little. The dice a real pieces of crap, which is not too big of a deal since any wargamer out there should have boat loads of D6s kicking around. It is too bad that there are only 6 scenarios, but it should not be too hard to come up with some more. The limitation of 1 map kind of stinks and it is a shame that they did not at least make it double sided. The rulebook is nice and short, but there were a few areas that needed to be read over and over and were not as clear as it should have been.

I don't want to make it seem that I hate this product, on the contrary I am really looking forward to giving this a go. The subject matter interests me and looks like Mr. Walker has put together a fun and intuitive combat system. I am really looking forward to playing this one!

After one play I found the game to be a lot of fun. However, the rules just plain suck! So many questions came up that we we could not find the answers for. The impression I get is that the rulebook was put together and edited without having an eye for the complete newbie to this system. The rulebook needs to be seriously overhauled and living rules made available for download!

My rating is lower than it ought to be mainly because of the crappy rules!

I raised the ratings because LnL finally has seen the light and is posting their rule books online.

And you thought that playing the Soviets in WWII was good fun ...

For a guy who had NO interest in playing out Ronald Reagan's nightmare--or wet dream, perhaps--of a conventional war flashpoint in Germany, this game is a winner. 

Its mechanics, tension, plus out-and-out playabilty have utterly wiped away any prejudices I held toward the subject matter. This is just a good game that, in my four playings by Feb. 08, have absolutely come down to the wire. We'll see how this holds out over time, particularly after the small batch of scens have been played repeatedly and optimal approaches have been sussed out, but the early going has been thoroughly enjoyable. Sure, you have scens where American armor is tasked with taking and holding town hexes, which is utterly not viable nor within the realm of doctrine (ask an American tanker, or play against one), but it all comes out in the wash in terms of the satisfying experience it delivers. This thing is tense, easy-to-teach, and serves up some laughs.

And BTW, the VASSAL module is top-notch.

After one play, I'm on the fence. To some degree it does feel like advanced [i]Ogre[/i]. So, it's simple, has some good unit variation and some interesting mechanics, such as opportunity fire. I generally like the chit activation system, though it could work out poorly in extreme cases.

On the other hand, the rulebook is a bit maddening, and the growing FAQ would indicate that I'm certainly not the only one who finds it difficult. I understand the desire to keep the rules to a minimum, but if it comes at the expense of customer frustration it's not worth it.

Physically, the counters are a bit difficult to read, in part because they're too small at 5/8", and in part because there's so much information on them. Given the relatively low number of different types of units, I think simply putting the information on a reference sheet instead of on the counters themselves would have been better. It's not like one T-72 is different from another. The map isn't very large, so going to 3/4" counters (or possibly even 1") would have been much better.

RATING: 6
Clever little wargame of medium complexity. Tactical scale with about 4 tanks per counter. World at War compares pretty well to the classic Tank Leader series from West End, though I'm not sold on it yet. The opposed dice system is imported from GW-style tabletop miniatures games, but seems to work fairly well. Rating could possibly rise after trying more scenarios.
 
This game features two elements that make it stand out: random activation and opportunity fire. I very much appreciate the chit-pull system coming back into vogue... it removes the stale predictability from command. The opportunity fire system adds importance to terrain and positioning and makes it more a game of wits than dice-hucking.
 
Note that the difference between US and Soviet forces are not trade-offs or marginal advantages. Front-line Soviet main battle tanks will explode like an episode of the A-Team. Also I have minor quibbles with the busy art direction, and I would have preferred funtional, readable counters.

RATING: 9
An extremely clean and simple combat system that has beautiful maps and counters. Although some might find the subject matter (a hypothetical conflict in 1985 between the Soviet Union and NATO forces) a bit disconcerting, I find the game reminds me of the halcyon days of SPI in the late seventies that put out such games, like MechWar77 and Red Star/White Star. The game plays very quick and shows the violent and fast battle field that might have taken place. The Soviets have quantity versus the Americans which have firepower. As a pure wargame this game plays smoothly and quickly. I was surprised by the game, as a wargamer it allows you to test out tactics such as forward defense or defense in depth and setting up firing ranges and enemy approaches.

Activation order (Chit-driven with variable turn end) is the most important element in the game.  Don't be put-off by the low number of scenarios, the variation of activation order alone will suffice to keep most scenarios fresh.

Really good game for gamers who like chaos or friction.  Not as good for those who game by perfect plan or bean counting.

Could use more "Ops Completed"/"Disrupted" markers.

This is one of my favorite Wargames to get on the table! It is straight forward, balanced, quick, and just right for scale. What it lacks in combat details it makes up for in credible game play. My only issue is with the size of the counters vs the information on them...some of those numbers are really small! The art design of counters and maps is great...but did I mention the small size of the counters? It is worth it!

Hypothetical contemporary (well, 1985 is sort of contemporary) "military fantasy" tactical game that launched a platoon-level armored combat system.  Very streamlines, interactive, and fun.  Definitely emphasizes game aspects, but the attention to detail for combat actions and effects isn't scrimped.  The system has become quite popular over the years and moved into WWII; despite that, the "World At War" storyline, modules, and expansions keeps getting played and keeps growing.

intéressant petit jeu sur un conflit hypothétique. il faut aimer lancer des brouettes de dés, mais sinon ça se joue rapidement, c'est simple à comprendre, dynamique et rigolo à jouer. Sans parler d'alternative à un système plus lourd (ASL, LNL,...) c'est intéressant pour de rapide parties avec des joueurs qui ne sont pas des grognards.

Short platoon level chitpull (lighter fare).  First play July 08.  A 7/10 just felt to low, so I'm giving it an initial 8/10, I would like to play more.  Combat is brutal (read: opposite of PG) - It is pretty light, with combat quite luck driven, but the tactical element is strong and engaging.

A solid wargame that did not quite live up to my admittedly high expectations. There is a lot to like here -- nice graphical presentation, short rules that held up to spirited but friendly play, good mechanics for activation and shooting/being shot, and an accurate depiction of "if you are seen, you will be killed" armored combat. But the game was dicier in play than it read on the page, particularly in the closing turns when a few HQs have been whacked and the surviving units are laboring under disruption. After the second or third time of rolling for command, then rolling for rallies I found myself wishing that companies just had a morale breakpoint and would leave the field and be done with it after sustaining significant casualties. I was also disappointed in the scenarios (at least the first three), which while nicely balanced were of the "overwhelming force assaulting a hunkered-down defender"variety -- certainly valid given the game's future history storyline, but I would have liked a bit more give-and-take. It just isn't that much fun to get pounded all game with little opportunity to go over on the offensive. In this, Eisenbach Gap might be a better solo game than a two-player experience, as the scenarios have the sense of puzzles that need to be solved rather than free-flowing meeting engagements, and the random activation system certainly gooses up the solo possibilities a bit. In the end I find it a game that I would play again but am not especially eager to return to the table. It will likely get traded before I can get back to it, and I will definitely opt out of the already-mushrooming expansion products available for this line. I will poke my head in and check out the WWII version of the game, though, as shorter engagement ranges, a bit less "bang-you're-dead" gameplay, and good old Panzer porn might be just the tipping point to get me on board with this system.

I played white star rising and I enjoyed it, but I didn't continue playing the game because the maps bugged me a bit. silly, but true. they were smaller than WaW the color was really bright and they tended to warp.

RATING: 4
Rating after playing scenario 1 just once. 

Mixed feelings about this game. I think the map, counters and basic mechanics are really good. 

But the activation process is way too random: 3 out of 8 turns didn't see any playing at all as the End Turn chit was the first one to come out; and in the other 5 turns only the Americans got activated while the Soviets only had their initial activation in the entire game.

Besides, after checking both sides' OBBs, it seems the Soviets are going to have more or less the same kind of problem with their activations in the rest of the scenarios, since their most important formations only get one chit per turn.

And last but not least, it seems NATO firepower is a little bit too devastating. 

I will give it another chance, though, as I feel that the game might improve with more chits in the cup and more units on the map.

UPDATE: Revised my initial rating after I realised that we were drawing the activation chits in a wrong way.

However, I still feel that the game seems unbalanced in NATO's favor and that playing with the Soviets can be a little bit frustrating given the fact that their best formations only get one activation per turn (if any).

I'll play a few more scenarios over Vassal, though, so I can hopefully get a more precise opinion about the system.

Hmmmm, well I finally bought and played this. I would recommend this for those that like light, simple wargames with easy to read rules. I will have to play this more, but at the moment I am not hugely impressed with this, where are the interesting decisions? I will play it a bit more to find out, but at the moment I am no so hot on this one. Bucket of dice combat resolution, which seems very tedious. I think the simplicity of the system might allow it to be played over a larger scale. This might introduce more interest, we shall see. I've given it a 7 for now untill I really learn to appreciate/hate this game.

Seems to be fast-playing and intuitive.  I've only played solo, but it was fun.  I'm not used to stacks of counters, so I'll have to get more practice at manipulating quite high stacks!  Rules are quite easy to follow once you get going pushing counters, but they leave quite a lot of room for interpretation.  For a relative newbie like me they are in desperate need of a FAQ - my only other experience is with Downtown and Combat Commander and they both have pretty watertight rulebooks.  The graphics are fantastic (although I could do without all the backwards letters) and the board is beautiful.  I am disappointed with the counters.  My original set were misaligned so that the underline on the HE Firepower was missing.  Replacements were very speedily sent, but are a new style and a step backward IMO; the art has been shrunk to minimise misalignment making the numbers harder to read and the pictures fuzzy.  The die-cutting is also not great - mine don't have straight edges.  Please use the same printer as GMT!

UPDATE: Rating of 6 given to reflect the number of ambiguities in the rules which have become apparent whilst gaming against a real opponent.  In desperate need of a FAQ...

An easy to get into,and pretty streamlined ( at least for the seasoned, or somewhat experienced wargamers ) tactical wargame. Plays pretty fast due to the few counters needed for a single scenario. And tough I like the chit pull mechanism in general,I think it's a bit out of place in a tactical level game, it seems to me it's more suited for the operational and strategic level games. The counters could be a bit thicker, otherwise a nice wargame in the tradition of Panzerblitz and/or Panzer Leader.Let's see if it will be able to garner such a following for itself.

Maybe the only one Cold War tactical wargame available.
Some nice ideas but doesn't reach the level other great tactical games. 

It depicts well the lethality of modern combat and has a great variety of combat outcomes.

But far too many tanks and far too few infantry (the proportion should be just reverse!) and infantry is too difficult to destroy.

Rating based on 5 real plays and a few solo ones.  There's a lot to like here, [i]but[/i] I feel like I kind of burned out on this pretty quickly, mostly because--although there are plenty of fun decisions to make during play--I feel like the outcome of the game is based so heavily on the order in which the chits get drawn.

Component quality is "OK"; I appreciate that they went with a thicker-than-paper map, but the counter stock is unusually thin, and I've actually had some of my counters fall apart!  (The front & back separated, but were easy enough to glue back together.)  The counters look great (although "3" and "5" are too similar in the font they chose), but the map art is just OK.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This is an excellent game to anyone's collection.  The game is easy to learn, but presents some difficult situations to overcome.  The chit draw system makes the games really exciting and allows each game to swing back and forth.  The components and graphics are top notch.  Can wait for the expansions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I hope the system can simulate the doctrinal differences at tactical level for both sides - the NATO and Soviet.  Many sceanrios in this game to choose from. 10-pages rules.  The map is nicely done with some glassy study materials and lay straight flat for easy movement of the counters.  The counters fell off from the trees easily and the dices are some awfully Chinese made white Mahjong dices.  This disappoints me a bit.  The dices are important for attack and defense rolling to hit or to save number.  So it is the right time to buy a dice tower to play this game.  The counters art itself is cool. 

Platoons are activated by pulling their formation markers and there are 2 end turn markers inside the cup to pick up.  A game turn ends when the second end turn marker is picked.  Dud, the Soviets should have a mandate to finish the war very soon. They have the numerical superiority but the media is not on their side.  However, I do find some of the activation rules confusing with regards to the non-formation activation of a side, especially when both sides pick up an end turn chit in a row.  

Each platoon unit has been assigned with many combat rating capabilities in the modern world battlefield.  Tanks, AFVs, Helicopters and infantry have both Amour-piercing ("AP") and High Explosive ("HE") firepower.  As the name suggests, AP is used to attack tank and AFV units amour value (these units are called "hard" targets). HE is used against the other soft targets like infantry, transporting units and helicopters.  Both are resolved the same way though by rolling the no. of dices equal to either firepower and each no. equal to or greater than the "To-hit" number score a hit on the defender.  Same for the defender, who rolls the number of dices equal to the armor value plus the defensive terrain die bonus.  Each dieroll equal to or greater than the defender's "Save" number ignores a hit.  For soft targets, each roll of 5 saves a hit.  The first hit would disrupt a unit (render it not able to fire but may still move) and the second hit would reduce the target a step.  If a unit is already disrupted, it is eliminated.  Opportunity Fire is available when enemy in sight (LOS) makes a move.  The firing unit becomes "Operations Complete" for the current activation.  

For range attacks, they should have a clear LOS to the target to attack.  A tank would have a range of 10 while an infantry could only have 2 for HE and a poor 1 for AP.  Go figure how powerful the modern tank battalions are and they are the main cast for every future battle.  Units can also fire into the extended range, 2 times the normal range, at an increased "To-hit" number by 1.  Woods, city, hill are blocking terrains.  Rough and wreck are blocking if the LOS crosses them in two consecutive hexes or more.  Units can be "concealed" in these blocking terrains (i.e. not observed by a "R" recon enemy unit) and receive one more defensive bonus dieroll.  

Headquarters are important for the formations as they are the centre for coordinating the battles.  Units should be in command within the command range of the headquarters.  If they are not, a morale check is rolled against HQ's morale rating to see if it can be in command.  An out of command unit cannot attack or move (speaking a disaster!)  However, morale is checked for each hex, not each combat units in the hex.  

Helicopters can move unlimited over the map.  However, if they want to fire, they should not move more than 12 hexes, simulating the effects of attack while hovering.  They can move over enemy units and stay there and move across all kinds of terrain at no cost.  A good or bad strategy on how to best use them might cost you the battle.  

Rules are fiddly in some areas like LOS (mentioning the hex center to another in determining LOS in an example of play only!), attack results rules i.e. attacking individual unit in a stack instead of applying all results to the stack, definition of control (the side with the last units in), HQ command range (not counting the HQ hex) etc.  Poor development with some holes, these rules are essential to the play and they should have been more tightened up (minus a lot of the rating).  At other times you would see some logically contradictory like 6.4 Overrun Combat, "...If the attacking AFVs are disrupted or reduced, they are not allowed to exit the hex, and are retreated into the hex from which they entered the overrun hex."  or some "offending" worded rule like "AFV...may not overrun the same twice in the same impulse.  It just looks silly." 

It is also disappointing to see there are not enough markers for Out of Command/ Wreck markers as things go hectic as the game progresses.  No, you wouldn't have the spare markers from the expansion game Death of the 1st  Panzer either.  Many moving-fire capable tank units whose identifying underscore under the firepower rating cannot be seen on the counters.  I wish I could have given it a rating of "8" but it was notched down to "7" because of the less than stellar clear rules which have every reason to be better written in the first place.  The short pages don't have to mean this is as simple a game at its first glance when you come to realize there are in fact a lot of interactions on both sides and the weapons statistics. The game is still, after all, very playable though.                

There are 6 scenarios in the game, 2 using part of the map and the rest uses the whole.  Scenario 1 is a training scenario where the Soviet units must seize the two towns Eisenbach and Bergengipfel before turn 8 (in this game a turn ends when you pick 2 end turn markers adding uncertainty as to when the game ends).  NATO should hold the northern woods and hills area as the aggressor tanks swarm in from the northwest Schlafendbauer.  The Soviets have the numerical superioriy and NATO have the defensive terrain.  The Soviets have 4 high explosive missions (read artillery) and the initiative (they deploy after NATO units and automatic first turn initiative without pulling the 1st Tank chit.) Nonetheless, the locations are fictional (well you can find Eisenbach but not Bergengipfel on google map).  The game is more of an examination of modern day arsenals and attack doctrine than anything else.  

Scenario 3 Rolling Hot sees the Soviets entrenching in the towns awaiting for the coming of the American Alpha and Delta forces.  The American has the surprise this time and they can fire two barrage missions by plotting the target hexes in secret around the town of Hugelsdorf.  The Soviet 33rd Rifle platoon with two T-72s was deployed in a forward position around Hugelsdorf.  The objective of the American is to capture the town of Eisenbach in the northeastern part of the map.  The Soviet 1st Tank platoon would enter on turn 3 with 5 T-72s as reinforcement and hence it is interesting to see when the Soviets will strike - strike early or waiting for the arrival of the 1st Tank for one general strike at the back of the American?  The American has no reinforcement but many artillery missions like HE and DPICMs, shaking the earth and shocking the Soviets out of the holes.  No helicopters are available to both sides in this scenario.

RATING: 8
A very nice and simple wargame 'light'. The random-ish nature of the turn sequence and variable length makes planning difficult, but not as random as Combat Commander seems to me. It works, and models differences in command and control, as well as battlefield chaos nicely. 

"The pools of dice"-system seems to work quite well, but artillery seems a bit nerfed (the ability to disrupt AFVs is essential, but the occational kill should be possible imo).

The scenarios are quite time-constrained; so if you are on the attack you had better get a move on! - you never know when you draw that second end turn marker, that means that your prime formation doesn't get to activate this turn. Also, there isn't too much room to maneuver on the map, giving a somewhat limited set of options in most scenarios

Short rulebook, which is nice, but could also have used some clarity in a few spots.  I don't know why LnL doesn't include player aid cards that help with turn sequencing and such.  An interesting, fun game.  The battles are quick and brutal.  I think this will come out regularly.

I've been wanting to play a hypothetical conventional WWIII for several years now. I grew up in the 80s and still remember when the USSR was the boogeyman. I'd prefer miniatures rules, and already have several GHQ miniatures, but I've been unable to find any mini rules that appeal to me.

RATING: 9
I designed and publish the game, so I want to be fair with the rating. It honestly is one of my favorite systems --the opposed-die-roll combat is great fun, and gives you that slug-it-out feeling. The art (Olivier Revenu) is colorful, well detailed, and and evocative of the period. Some people have told me they would like a darker map. I understand that.I think the counters should be a bit thicker. That was a miscommunication between my company and the printer. The upcoming expansion, Death of the 1st Panzer, uses the same thickness, but from that point on, we'll go to a thicker counter. I've also heard that some folks would like more wreck markers. Fair enough. We'll post some on our website soon.I also enjoy the formation activation system. For those of you who don't know, the system gives the American companies the chance to activate twice per turn, while the Soviet battalions will (usually) do no better than once. Then again, since the End Turn chits are in the same cup, the turn might end before anyone does anything. I guess that's about it.

Fast, ferocious, colorful, fun. The modern battlefield is suitably unforgiving and deadly, the only exception being artillery, which makes a rather weakish showing. The combat system is really quite ingenious: you throw some number of d6, scoring a hit off of each one on some number or better; the other guy then throws some number of d6, saving a hit on some number or better off of each; all of these numbers are right there on the counters, so no chart lookups. The scenario mix is also admirably diverse: there are only six in the box, but you get a first contact battle, a combined arms assault, a mobile counterattack, a big tank slugfest, a night fight, and an airborne operation. My only complaints are the components: I find the map art not at all evocative of the "dark world" the game seeks to portray, and the counters are real thinnies. (Also, there aren't enough wreck markers.)

Update: The Gamers Guide is a surprisingly nice addition, with several well-written and worthwhile articles.

Very nice presentation, with well-crafted game engine and rules. Complexity on the low side but engagement level is high.

RATING: 7
World War 3 circa 1985, platoons, 150m hexes, 5-15 minutes per turn.

Fast playing and deadly but with results that seem "about right" to this gamer.

Chit draw system really adds to the suspense of the game and improves replayability.

Somewhat underwhelmed by the value/components ratio, but what is in the box is well produced (2'nd printing has thicker counters done in a semi-gloss finish).  There are only 6 scenarios in the box, but all the ones I've tried so far have been enjoyable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Interesting what-if depicting a world war in 1985.

Chit-drawn initiative system makes for excellent replayability and fun and undecided-to-the-last turn games.

In my opinion, rules are even too simple and might be a bit more detailed. Many expansions titles.
The game lacks a decent history backup (we don't know why the war has begun, and the whole story behind) -except a terrible attempt appeared on the magazine Line of Fire involving a supernatural finale, involving zombies, werewolves and so on. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A very impressive system. The limited scale produces a fast moving, intense game that is very easy to explain and pick up. The small details on the counters can take a little while to get used to, but once you know what you're looking for the game really flows. Definitely one of the most enjoyable games I bought in 2007, one of those games that I am eager to play at all opportunities right now, and it is great to play a game set in an era that doesn't get much treatment in gaming.

RATING: 7.5
Relatively easy rules to digest, although there are a couple of gaps (so to speak). Nice components, fast and furious gameplay. Overall it is fun, but there is something missing (at least from the first two scenarios), that I just can't put my finger on. Maybe it's too lopsided and there isn't a whole lot of maneuvering. We'll have to see. Scenario 4=huge slaughter-fest for the U.S.--they wiped out nearly the entire Soviet force. Having potentially two (or three w/Op fire) activations per turn is a great advantage to the NATO forces. I want to rate this an 8, but the scenarios all seem unbalanced (either the Soviets far outnumber NATO, or NATOs firepower and activation advantages overwhelm the Russians).

A "lite" version of Assault as described by many.  I  couldn't get past the "saving throw" method of modeling the armor of units being fired upon, so gave up on this series as overly simplistic (had I never played GDW's Assault, it probably wouldn't have bothered me as much).

First of series of platoon level combined arms (tactical) combat games set in Europe circa 1985. Moderately easy to learn, Fun. Exciting. Realistic, but not  overwhelming. Very playable.

A fun, simple wargame that uses a novel buckets-o-dice opposed roll combat system. As the Soviets, I quickly learned that I needed to charge headlong into the U.S. player to take my objectives (which I did for the win).  I'm looking forwad to giving this some more plays.

RATING: 6
The game is not too complicated and rather fast to play.

I've been a little bit disappointed though as I find it favors the NATO far too much (with better units and more activations).

In addition, it is sometimes difficult to find a specific point in the rules, a more detailed player aid card could be very useful.

I exected much more from this game ...

RATING: 8.5
Fantastic game.  The mechanics are relatively simple yet elegant. I was an infantry platoon commander in the late 80s, and find that the game certainly captures the "feel" of that era.

My only issue with the game is that I find the counters a bit small and difficult to read.  Use of bigger, heavier counters, like those in Conflict of Heroes or Hold the Line would make this one a '10' for me.

RATING: 7.5
Entertaining game which portrays theoretical modern warfare (if the 1980's count as modern). Good design and well thought out scenarios. It's fairly concise and pretty brutal, but there is good scope for strategy and it plays quickly, so there is often time for a rematch if you cock up your game plan. After a few plays I still find there are a few fiddly rules and exceptions, which stop this from scoring higher. (8.5)

Pros: Only 8 pages of rules, fast playing, nice counter art, cardboard board.

Cons: Counters thin & hard to pick up, a few numbers on counters are very difficult to read, rules are pretty good but are not as clear and clean as they could be, small number of counters, only 6 scenarios.

RATING: 9
In short - an amazingly simple game that still maintains a level of detail that nicely portrays the fighting that was to be expected in any NATO-WP battle in Europe.


The components are very well done as the art work on the map and counters present a clean looking playing surface with detailed pics of main battle tanks and infantry fighting vehicles / armored personnel carriers.  The rules are short and concise an can be read in about 15 minutes with limited need to flip back after teh first scenario or so.

Gameplay is chit selection driven with a possible random end to turns (thre are chits that end the turn possibly before all formations are activated) & follows a pretty standard moving / shooting / opportunity fire actions flow.  I'd be surprised if even the largest scenario takes more than 2 hours to play out so completing in a sitting is a lock

Combat activities are all driven by values on the counters - # of dice to hit, # needed to hit, # of dice to save against a hit & the number needed on those rolls are all well placed on the counters and have eliminated the need to look at charts.

The few things for improvement : 

The scenarios typically play so quick that you may play through them all rapidly and be looking for more beyond the six provided (yes there is a decent amount of variability in the scenarios to keep you setting them up again, but a few more would have been nice).

The rules have about 2-3 rules references that are not where I expected to find them and can cause a bit of flipping during play.  On the plus side - they are there and well written - maybe just not in the first place you look.  Very minor with a ruleset about 6 pages long...

Lastly the counters : some sheets both of the US & Soviet counters are very closely cut on the edges placing the unit values leaning towards the diecut.  Not of mine are unreadable, but it would obviously be nice if they were centered as designed.

See my comments on the sister game Blood & Bridges. This title is docked half a point for three reasons: (a) Less content and chrome than in B&B; (b) a far more open map making for less interesting tactical situations; (c) generally uninteresting scenarios of the old-school set-piece type.

Easy rules, plays fastly and I like the WWIII setting. Luck can screw you, especially the activations, but usually it is your own fault if you are going down in flames. You need to have balls of steel if a bad activation sequence happens that ruins your carefully planned attack/defense. But you should not give up too early since the activations can bring you back into the saddle.

Light-medium game on Cold War alt-WW3 tactics. Good ideas, but practically a bit unwieldy when 2 units with Disruption and Ops Complete counters all stack, and some counter details are hard to read (firepower underlined?). Quite flowing after digesting the quite scattered but compact rules.

For a pretty simple game (8 pages of illustrated rules for a wargame), there are several rules ambiguities that have repeatedly come up and interrupted play.  The low unit density really accentuates the swings of luck that come with back to back unit activations.  Losing your HQ in a one formation game is particularly unforgiving.  I'd like to try this again with a multi formation scenario, and see if the game improves.

Nice simple wargame that feels like a midway between Target Arnhem and something like ASLSK#1. Great to take cold war units for a spin in some what-if scenarios that aren't too outlandish. Tons of scenarios in the box, and a nice semi-mounted deluxe map. The counters are impossibly hard to read, though -- they should have been bigger.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game scratches a nice itch for "modern" warfare.  The gameplay is fast and furious once you get things going -- buckets of dice can be very fun.

However, the price is a tiny bit on the high side for what you get.   The map is one-sided and really doesn't seem to be enough for what you pay (thankfully I won my copy in a raffle but not everyone will have that luxury).  The sheer chintziness of not having enough informational counters to play comfortably (ie. wreck counters) forced me to learn how to mount counters.  Last gripe:  the underlining on the counter numbers is invisible except to Superman.

Blood and Bridges is a superior overall product.

RATING: 5
Cobbled together bits of older tactical games and miniatures rulesets, but it all hangs together pretty well, and the total package is definitely more than the sum of its parts.  In particular, the chit activation and its interaction with opfire and command seems to drive the game differently than most other platoon-level offerings.  Reminded me most of GDW's old platoon-level system (Sands of War, etc.), but the formation rules and buckets o' dice bolt-ons keep it fresher than that sounds.  Need to play some larger scenarios before I come down on one side of the fence or the other. [b]Update:[/b] Played a larger scenario and decided that though I like the activation mechanic, the dicey combat system is not that well tweaked and the victory conditions tend to be a little whack, so off to the trade pile it went (which lasted all of a day!)

All the flaws of a table top are there but non of the benefits (which is basically the nice miniatures).

A very smooth, award-worthy game system.  My esteem for the game grows as I learn more .

Rules are very amusing but could be better organized.  Dropping rating from 9.4 to 8.8 due to some lack of well-balanced scenarios.

Greeeaaat!  Simple system, low counter-count, plays quickly and smoothly.  The scenarios in the first expansion are even better designed than in the base game--get both!This series is great, hampered only by less-than-ideal counter design--poor font choice which makes numbers like 3s and 5s difficult to discern, and unfortunate "reduced" side indication, which is a barely perceptible lightening of a band behind the unit symbol.  Neither break the game, and don't hurt too bad if you're playing close attention--but both should be fixed since both problems only hurt the game and were done apparently solely for aesthetic reasons.

[1 play] Initial reaction rating based on playing the first scenario.  First off I was not into the theme. I am not a big war game fan in general and have a preference for medieval or fantasy war if I do play them.  Secondly I am just not a huge fan of this type of dice rolling combat system.  Third this particular scenario seemed to heavily favor the Americans (which likely it was supposed to), but it made for not a super close game.  All that said though, I certainly didn't hate the game.  It was easy to learn, easy to play.  There was nothing broken or bad about the rules or general gameplay.  Although it is not on the top of my want to play list, I would consider playing additional scenarios of this just to see a larger battle and have a closer more balanced game.

Clean, acsessible, and an eminently playable system that is very good solo and great ftf. Graphical presentaion is very good, but the font on the counters is too darn small.

Eisenbach Gap hits the mark just as the designer intended.I like the comparsion to a modern day Panzerblitz - only done better.

RATING: 6.5
I like the basic concept and the "historical" period, but had more problems than expected to understand some points of the rules properly. I agree with other comments that say the rules are ambiguous in some places, but collected rules FAQs make things clearer (unfortunately, I read them only AFTER my first play... At least, I realized I had played right).
However, after initial difficulties play was fun and furious (fire at close range is deadly as it should be), with lots of dice rolls but that's not a problem for me.
The game depicts quite well the usual idea of Soviet massed tank attacks countered by small numbers of highly trained US forces just like in Team Yankee novel.
In the end, I found more pros than cons and was left with the wish to play it again.
Initial rating after first solo play, it might improve.

RATING: 6
A very good simple wargame.  Short rules (~10 pages of real rules) and simple/quick setup of scenarios.  Now please note this review comes from someone who likes short games that play well solo.  I read the rules and played the first scenario 2 times the same day.  Also, I love A Victory Lost and this uses the chit pull system that I like so much from that game.  One negitive is cheap counters.  I am not sure why the did not put a little bit more into the counters and add 50% more thickness to them.  They are nice looking and have LOTS of good info on them but with a little bit more effort I would have rated the game a little higher.

Very good game on Modern battle set in cold war era.  Excellent Vassal module extends the value to be able to play live or PBEM.  Very good feel for the differences in quantity (Soviets) vs quality (US and German forces (DoFP)).  Blemish on the whole package is the lack of a good Sequence of Play chart and some better rule writing and player aids.  These blemishes keep me from rating this product higher which it could've achieved with a bit more attention to detail.

W@W Original Series from 2007 onwards.
This and all the extras I had have now been sold on. I actually quite enjoyed this game system, and was looking forward to the recent re-design too. However, the new stuff is incompatible it seems with the old. That made my mind up to just clear this out, and perhaps I'll return to it (new version) sometime but that's unlikely, as I'm enjoying other game themes now. Hope the re-design works out OK.

For the original Eisenbach only version. A good intro to the series.  The rules are not that complex.  The map is mounted but not as nice of quality as the one in Blood and Bridges. Overall mediocre components in this version. If you had to choose between the two I'd go with B&B as the rules are slightly updated and the terrain charts are now in color.  An excellent game system with plenty of dice rolling fun, variable unit activations, and good opportunities for strategies.

For the deluxe edition (I have both). What the original should have been. Comes with Dot1stPz and two bonus scenarios. Much nicer map and units. If you're a casual gamer or light fan, I don't think getting the deluxe is justified if you have the originals. I'm a completionist, so YMMV.

Rating based on a solo play of scenario #1.  70% of the Soviet armor was shot up getting near the objective, American forces were hammered by artillery fire missions.  Total carnage!  Looking forward to teaching this one to my gaming buddies.  Chit-pull system adds a ton of suspense.

Game is holding up after repeated plays, very nice.



Annoyed by the fact we are running out of Out of Command and Wreck counters (they are backprinted on each other) Looks like the playtesting was not done with the final components.  Fix this in a future expansion please.

Counter art is very, very good.  Same size/thickness counters of Panzer Grenadier by Avalanche games, which I don't mind at all.  Board art is very good, looks like the German plain.

Thanks for no halos on the hex borders, may I never see those again.

This is my first Wargame that is more complex than M'44. As a total newbie to this type of game I woul say it is very very good. The only down points would be the slightly confusing rulebook, which sems to introduce elements of the rules before they have been explained. This becomes apparent as you get to the end of the booklet, but was confusing for someone like me at first. After 1 solo play of Scenario 1 I have rated at 8.25, as some of the rules were totally forgotten in my excitement, and there are no 'sequence of play' crib sheets, which may have corrected my mistakes. Overall though, I think it is a great game, with superlative production and presentation values.

After years of playing MBT, Assault and Fire Team, it is very refreshing to find such a game system as World At War.

The stage is setup: WWIII in the 80's. The game puts you in command of US or Soviet platoons in action packed scenarios in Germany. 

The rules can be learnt in no time and the fun is there. Do not be misled though! The game has a huge potential and this will not be so easy to win your games either as the Soviet player or as the NATO one.

Really great stuff at an affordable price!

Do I really need 11 different numbers on a counter and multiple dice rolls for a single battle for what is supposed to be a simple wargame? Lock and Load once again adds complexity/extra dice rolls for little apparent value or extra realism.

If you liked Panzer Blitz/Panzer Leader, then you like this cold war type game that has a few twists added. Chit draw system, simplicity of play, all good stuff. I would rate this game a 10 if they only would come out with a Series rules, and then all they would need for the expansions would be the special rules. As it is, skip all the rule books and read Untold Stories to be up to date.

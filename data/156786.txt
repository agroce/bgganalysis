LIKE: Tower defense. The negotiation in the game is mildly interesting.
DISLIKE: Too many take that elements and little tension in the gameplay. Very random.
OVERALL: Not my thing, but I can see kids enjoying this.

its ok. I actually think this would be a great game for kids. But if you want deep strategy look elsewhere. Just seemed to easy to me. Was pretty fun to sabotage my boyfriend though :D

Uma divertida versão de Castle Panic ambientado no universo Munchkin que tem um forte apelo de gozação. Funciona até melhor que o Castle Panic original.

Fun and Simple - Game is quick moving once the rules are learned
Nice Munchkin humor, though its a reuse of cards from the main Munchkin game rather than original Munchkin cards... but still humorous and enjoyable.

I love the cooperative style of this game. You can add Munchkin negative interaction but if you do not like backstabbing your friend you do not have to.

RATING: 7.7
I don't know how often I'd bring this out against the original Castle Panic, or Star Trek Panic, but it does have more of a competitive Munchkin feel to it, and certainly does the theme justice within the Panic engine. A good game, it's just that with the expansions, the original has more to offer.

A different take on the Munchkin game, you have to be kind of co-operative to win

If you're a fan og both classic Munchkin and Castle Panic, this should be in your game library without a doubt. While I'm a huge fan of Castle Panic I enjoy some of the Munchkin spinoff titles more than the base game. Still this is a very good cross of the two properties, with a lot more flexibility than either one with variant rules that make it customizable to your group's taste.

Tower Defense board game, Munchkin version of Castle Panic. I've never played at Castle Panic but I think it's pretty similiar, you can add the quantity of Munchkinism to the rules that you want. It's a funny "not really" cooperative game.

I don't find this game very challenging.  It is a good introductory game, but not for me, who likes more meat in the game.  The in-game expansion is dumb.  I will most likely get rid of this game from my collection.

It's simple... but it's playable solo and its a nice little distraction. I have yet to play multi-player with the semi-co-op rules which may change things quite a bit.

Having played Munchkin a while back, this was a really fun co-op strategy thing that balanced difficulty just right. The Munchkin themed monsters and cards were consistently amusing and made it even more fun. It was challenging enough to feel really satisfied when we finished and won. I'm picky about the games I actually purchase for our family, and I'm considering this one for sure.

Still better than Munchkin, but not by much.  Remove that and you have Castle Panic, which is too simple to get much table time.  Artwork is cool, rulebook is bad.

Hey look, it is Castle Panic but with added sarcasm. Meh, not sure on this one. We played it once, and it has mostly stayed on the shelf. Still we had to try it, as Castle Panic is an old favorite.

This game is a rare example of a fusion between two other games that worked very well.
Munchkin Panic is a semi-cooperative game where players might betray others using monster enhancers in order to achieve their personal goals and win, even if that means destroying the castle.
Can also be played without monster enhancers making it a full cooperative game, however that makes it more Castle Panic than Munchkin.

Not quite the same as castle-panic--- it adds in some real player versus Player interactions that makes it harder.  Good for folks who like to play hardball, less good for those seeking a truly co op experience.

RATING: 4
With multiple promo cards and Tabletop Day promo castle pieces. 

I like Castle Panic. I like Munchkin. I don't like when they mix. If I want a backstabbing game I'll go in for just Munchkin. Castle is often hard enough to handle with straight coop, thank you, no reason we should stab each other and both lose.

[url=http://www.techuser.net/klondikeprob.html]Cooperative games are not games, they are puzzles. And whether I win or lose against a random inanimate/unintelligent algorithm, I am left feeling unsatisfied. I'd rather play a One versus All or a Team versus Team game. [/url]

Panic gets the Munchkin treatment. A "mostly" cooperative game. Adds health doses of Munchkin to a Castle Panic style game. Protect the castle while making yourself the most powerful.

The Munchkin theme is fun and so I can see this as a gateway for Munchkin players into other games. But otherwise it is just a retheme of Castle Panic which lacks the expansions which have come out for the original.

If you invest in expansions you'll get deeper experience with regular Castle Panic but as an old Munchkin fan I prefer this version. It sticks to basic Castle Panic formula but with slightly higher difficulty and fun, optional munchkiny backstabbing mode.

An aesthetic re-printing of Castle Panic but the Munchkin themed additional rules add a bit of variety. The game itself is a fast-paced, co-operative game that offers a real challenge, unlike some this gets harder with less players.

More Castle Panic than Munchkin, which is a good thing in my book. Main reason to own it if you already own Castle Panic+Expansions (which I do) is that the variant where everyone is on their own is actually better here (so if you want to play the "take that" game, this is the one). When you want a cooperative though, I can't recommend enough the original Castle Panic over this hybrid version.

Huge fun semi-co-op tower defence game. Munchkin theme not merely slapped on the top of Castle Panic but adds great screw-over and treasure mechanics to the game, all tied together with John Kovalic's ever awesome artwork. Great with 2 players, pretty well balanced, massive fun, great tension.

The Munchkin theme got a bit old, Castle Panic mechanics din't quite catch on. Thought I would like the semi-coop parts of the Munchkin additions, but they seemed too complex for what they were and I never really got to enjoy them. Had a few ok playthroughs, but decided I'd probably never play again and got rid of it.

Exactly as the title suggests...Munchkinized Castle Panic. And, the game plays exactly as you would think it would play combined.  It takes some getting used to the fact that you are playing to win and the co-op part is subservient.

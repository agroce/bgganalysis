We gave this its initiation.  The rules were simple and quick to pickup (though we forgot the freeze rule during our first few plays).  

Each of the rounds we found ourselves brutalizing the opponents force with the elephants and running a rabbits through to the finish.  

This game has a very 'in your face' feel to it.

It's like chess, but more primal.  Not nearly as strategic, but a whole lot more tactical.

An excellent abstract that of course is inlfuenced from Chess. You can even play it with a normal chess set if you put the 4 black holes in the places that ought to be. Even if you don't like Chess (Who doesn't like Chess though?)  you should give it a try.

Played on a standard chess board and pieces (though, I've made my own pieces and board for ease of play). Much more fun than chess!!! Btw - there is something like $17,000 reward for anyone who can make a computer program that can play this game well.

RATING: 6
Okay, this is a quirky one. It could conceivably actually get better after playing a few more times.  But the wrestling mechanic, the dragging mechanic, and the four steps each turn, do not exactly scream fun.  Dragging pieces into pits to kill them, heck, doesn't that sound fun?  A real hoot?  Kind of makes you nostalgic for chess where you simply "take" the opposing players pieces, you know, a more humane, quick way of killing them.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Like chess, this is a serious strategy game in which losing a piece through a single mistake condemns you to half an hour of pointless struggle against certain defeat.  If that's the type of game you're looking for, it's fine.

RATING: 8
Excellent 2 player game in many respects.  Simple to learn but with much depth revealed over many plays.  I've played about 60 games and it is still revealing depth. The only downside is what makes the game AI resistant, the 4 step turn.  This can lead to a degree of opacity and emphasis on tactics over strategy. Sometimes its hard to look into the game to any degree.

The deeper strategy is definitely above my head, but I like this one. I especially like how the emphasis is on position, not on killing off your opponent's pieces. My only gripe is that the length can be a bit too lengthy, to the point where it may be better to invest your time into a different game instead.

1.	Intro: This is my favorite abstract game.
2.	Weight: Heavy
3.	Audience: Appeals to all ages and types of gamers.  This chess with a theme.
4.	Players: 2 player
5.	Solitaire: no
6.	Bits: The pieces are very good, however I expect this game will catch on and the pieces will start being like chess.  
7.	Rules:  The rules are concise, clear and short.  If you are a moderator for the game its easy to explain in about 5 minutes.
8.	Setup:  5-10 minutes
10.	Game-flow: This game is prone to analysis paralysis
11.     Randomness: None.
12.     Interaction: This game is as confrontational as chess.
13.	Downtime: Depends who you play ...analysis paralysis.
14.	Fun:  The unique board, the movement by the different pieces, the hierarchy of the pieces and unusual win condition make this game engaging to the point of addictive.  Victory in this game is very satisfying.
15.	Theme:  The theme is like the reality show Survivor.  Its booting the other team members of the island through strategy.
16.	Recommendation:  I recommend this game for the those who love classic games like chess and for gamers that love abstract games.  I think this is a great game to show children.

Awesome two-player abstract game.  Actually a combination abstract wargame and race game.  Hard to get a handle on for a few plays, like Shogi is for players of Western Chess.  My rating will probably go up to a 9 with further play.  Very different kind of capturing mechanism using a push or pull move and traps.  Good website too.  Apparently not available for purchase, but playable online.

RATING: 10
My favorite game. The only game I've rated at 10. This is a superior two player abstract strategy game. BALANCED, easy to learn and play! A battle of the minds and on the board! Don't be caught off guard! Keep your wits about you!

Could easily become a classic from under the radar and be as revered as GO and overtake Chess! Fun and exciting. This game really rewards creativity and observation and intuition. The more you play the more you develop. I have won on enough occasions  when the odds weren't in my favor, unlike many other abstracts.

Arimaa has elegance, challenge, incredible depth, variations, choices, colossal branching factor, no "If I do this your best move is this", no memorized openings and patterns. I truly enjoy playing the game with limited time with an opponent. It forces us to make quick decisions judiciously. Which in turn helps the brain to learn to think quick.

Can you get one of your weakest pieces to the other side as stronger pieces do all they can to slow and even squash your advances?

An excellent little two player game.  The weighted pieces are really nice.  There is obviously a lot to think about, and whether this game appeals will depend on whether you like abstracts.  I am not a big fan of abstracts, but this is a solid game.

I'll leave it for others to gush about the game and how to play it.  I like it, and it also fits easily on my bookshelf and doubles as an animal-themed chess set, with a plain chessboard on the reverse of the game board.  There's enough room in the box for other chess or checkers pieces, as well.

RATING: 6
After seeing the commercial sets, I prefer using a normal Chess set and some coins to mark the trap spaces. Chess pieces might not be as representative of the various animals, but they are a lot easier to distinguish at a glance. As for the game, it's a good game, but hard to play well. I can see that it would take quite a while to develop any meaningful long-term strategies.

If I have a chess set and I'm teaching some kids how to play a game (scout camp, party, boardgame night), I'm teaching them Arimaa, not chess.

Instead of having to trudge through teaching them how each different piece moves/captures, castles, the spastic pawn, all I have to teach them is:
1) You win when you move your little guy to the other side.
2) Everyone moves the same, forward/back/left/right (except littlest guys can't go back).  There are no diagonals for anything.
3) Big guys freeze little guys, unless you have a friend.  ("Aaiii! I'm scared stiff!"  and "Go on buddy, you can do it!")
4) Big guys push (or pull) little guys around "just like your brother".
5) You'll fall in the hole unless you have a friend.  "Grab my hand, I'll save you!"

But there are more compelling reasons to advocate this game over chess than the ease of selling/explaining it to children.  The comments about draws, computer dominance, book openings, and so forth have been made elsewhere, and better, so I won't repeat them here.

Omar Syed had the idea of creating a game using a chess set, with a high branching factor but simple rules, to show that humans are still more intelligent than machines. It worked, and through his hard work Arimaa became one of the most successful modern abstracts, with a community of players, 2 (!) books (for comparison, there is one book about Hex, a much older game, and few other abstract books) and an annual world championship competition, as well as the open challenge to programmers to build an AI worthy of being crowned the best player on Earth. Arimaa is intriguing, deep, challenging and above all, fun! The feeling when you slip a rabbit through your opponent's defence to goal is very satisfying.

While I own a copy, most of my plays are online plays. My playing has slowed down recently, but I always look forward to playing and studying the game.

Arimaa is similar to Chess, but a completely different game. There are so many branches that can be taken, it's hard to know what the right move is, and the game is so young that even current Arimaa pros are always discovering new strategies and tactics!

RATING: 7
A fascinating game that will inevitably get compared to chess, although the only thing in common between the two is probably an 8x8 board.  The game is very deep, so deep in fact that one can not possibly ever check all legal moves - which is an excellent thing, because this way one cannot help his game by memorizing play sequences, which is one of my main complaints against chess.  The game also has a simple winning goal, one that can be achieved even with numerical disadvantages, therefore the game is very dynamic and sometimes one can witness the most amazing turnarounds. One of the very best abstract games.

A game designed to be hard for computers to brute force! The wikipedia entry under Computer Ineptitude descibes the mechanisms:
* 4 consecutive moves on a player's turn
 - hurts alpha-beta pruning
 - magnifies the branching factor
* capture difficulty
 - makes positions hard to score (material advantage is easy to score)
 - prevents pruning because there are few "obviously good" captures
 - positional play more crucial since it's more prevalent
 - eliminates endgames that are solved with retrograde analysis (working backwards) or tables
 - makes a defensive style possible, where an opponent must accumulate small long-term advantages that computers can't gauge well
* no standard deployment
 - eliminates an opening book

After a dozen or so bot plays I'm really lukewarm on this game.  The addition of 4-sub-move moves is interesting on first glance, but seems designed solely to thwart computers.  I suspect that a smaller number would have added more tension to the game.

Arimaa is an interesting abstract! A little slow to develop but definitely doesn't play like any other game. Not a chess variant, that's for sure. Our game didn't last the 60 minutes that is stated on box (more like 15-20). Perhaps because we are both new to this. Certainly with more consideration the game would slow down a bit. Otherwise, and interesting mix of pushing and pulling rules and forcing opponent pieces into "traps" to capture them (instead of simply landing on them). Looking forward to more plays of this one!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
As of April 2007, after more than four years and 50,000 online games, Arimaa is proving to be an extremely deep game.  Theory on how to play well is still rapidly expanding, due to active play and discussion at http://arimaa.com/arimaa/gameroom.  Top-level games from a year ago seem antiquated, and this happens year after year.  Each of the four annual World Championships has been won by a player who learned how to play less than a year earlier, and who absorbed all of the existing theory while contributing new ideas.  The prevailing strategies from a few years ago have not been discarded, but have been subsumed in a larger strategic universe.  Arimaa is often referred to as a chess variant, but it plays very differently.  Blockade and breakthrough are critical themes.  Capture is often more like a dam breaking under pressure than lightning striking from across the board.  Early suspicion that the game would devolve into defensive maneuvering has proven unfounded, as powerful offensive strategies have been discovered.  The defensive dual-lone-elephant opening, which once dominated top-level play, is now only part of a complicated mix of opening ideas.  Rabbit advances which were once frowned upon as too risky for the attacker are now judged as strategically advantageous in many circumstances, and absolutely essential in some.  There has yet to be a draw between human players.  Because creative thinking is so useful, Arimaa makes a superb human vs. human contest.  Even so, much of the fun at present is that humans can still beat the best computers.  Moreover, the advantage the best humans have over the best computers has widened in each of the last three years.  The top human players can overwhelm the top bots tactically as well as strategically.  Apparently imagination, planning, and judgment outweigh mere calculation.  Not only is it fun to beat the silicon monsters, it is good to have one's intellect challenged in way that doesn't call for brute force "If I do this, then he can do that, then I can do this, ..." etc.

On the surface, it has some similarities to Chess, but the goal actually feels more like Quoridor. 

Players have an array of different animals whose size represents their relative strength. These pieces can push or pull smaller pieces to block or destroy them. This can be prevented by having two or more of your pieces adjacent. This encourages cohesion among your pieces and makes breaking away both difficult and risky. The goal is to get your rabbit (the smallest piece) all the way across the board to your opponent's back row.

I liked it. It's definitely very deep. It's not as quickly accessible as Hive, but it does offer some good strategy problems. One of the keys to the game is the fact that each player makes four moves on a turn. That can make long-term planning very difficult and unpredictable. Overall, a good game.

The fact that can be played with a Chess set makes it a good alternate game. 

However, it is as analytical as Chess, and gameplay is not very intuitive: you have to learn slowly, and not all of us have so much patience.

I have read that if both players are experienced, the game can drag forever. I can't tell it by myself, because I'm still a noob.

The Z-Man version was a bit overpriced when it came out, as in only comes with small weighted plastic pieces and a cardboard game board. Still picked it up when the price dropped, though, as its nice to play with thematic pieces rather than just a modified chess set. Fascinating game either way, though, as its dynamic and full of interesting strategy. Really like the open setup, too, as it makes each game potentially unique right from the beginning. Haven't dove into it too deeply yet, but I already see how deep the journey could be.

This game is crazy complex strategically, but so easy to learn! It is so much faster than Chess in that allowing 4 moves per turn really allows the board to change quickly, the start is much faster, and the mid-game strategies last virtually the whole game. The effect in my novice mind is that this makes the game more fun. It is also easier to teach how to play. Plus, no openings to learn!

A very cool abstract that obviously has some depth to it. I'm not really sure its deeper than Chess (no one might be at this point) and I would bet $$$ that is not deeper than GO (nothing is...) but good at any rate. 

Very interesting that is was specifically designed to be difficult for computers, I think the 4 move allowance is what screws them up...? 

The pits on the board are neat and the very different endgame condition is interesting (actually the whole game plays very different from Chess). 

I think for now I definitely still prefer Chess but I have been playing that since 5 years old. I think things can bog down more so here than in the Classic.

My score reflects the fact that I'm not a huge fan of two player abstracts. My biggest criticism is that the pieces are all far too similar to each other, but that can be solved by substituting in standard chess pieces. On the plus side the rules are very simple. 

With better pieces I would be very happy to teach it to my children and recommend it to abstract fans.

COMMENT:
An excellent abstract strategy game. This should appeal to chess players. Although I don't play much chess myself, I find this a much more interesting game. Unsurprisingly, forward thinking is the key to success. I suspect, however, that pattern recognition plays much less of a role in Arimaa than it does in a game of chess, since Arimaa in many ways is a much more complex game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
For some reason every comment on and reference to this game I'd read had led me to believe it was a Chess variant with some wacky pieces and multiple moves per turn. Actually it's nothing of the sort. Instead picture two Stratego armies facing off in a big traffic jam, and then a couple of camels [url=http://www.mspaintadventures.com/test_index.php?s=4&p=000619]flip the fuck out[/url] and start hurling cats and rabbits down bottomless pits.

I've read all about how deep and amazing Arimaa is supposed to be but I don't know about that yet because strategy is kind of hard to evaluate. I suspect the game is best explored iteratively against the same player, with one successful ploy leading to a number of counter-ploys and ploy variants until later on an entire ploy tree is discarded. You can't get that just forcing a rabbit through some poor bot's weakest flank while it's busy sacrificing some of your pieces to the pit gods.

Elképesztően elegáns, egyszerű, fantasztikus tervezés. 5 percen belül kezdődhet a játék, ennyi elég a szabálymagyarázatra (a sakkról ez nem mondható el), és döbbenetes mélységei vannak, ráadásul nem is kell hozzá extra készlet, sakkal is játszható. Nagyon jó!

RATING: 8
Intriguing deep abstract strategy game. Looks from a distance like Chess with animal pieces, but the gameplay of Arimaa is fundamentally different with other movement allowances for the pieces, other victory goals and especially the possibility to use up to 4 movement actions. Lots of options to explore, but I doubt if I will spend the study time to get really good at this game. I am still dedictated to (try) learning Go ...

A very unique abstract strategy game: several unique pieces like chess, easier to learn than chess, and would literally take a lifetime to master.  The game was designed with the concept in mind that no computer will ever be able to beat the grandmaster of this game.

Unique concept of capturing pieces by putting them into these black hole spaces in the middle of the map.  Bigger animals push/pull smaller animals, and the smaller animals are frozen if another one doesn't come along to help them.  You win the game by getting a rabbit (similar to pawns) across the map.

What might be the whole selling point is that you get 4 moves per turn (and pushing something ahead of you or pulling it behind you count as moves).  So the combinations are very, very interesting.  You have to start looking ahead at what your opponent could do and what you could do.  

It's crucial where you position your elephant, as he's the most important player, and then second most important where you position your camel, and then horses and so on, because these will impact your dominion over different areas of the board.  Actually reminds me of stratego in that way, only there's no hiding from your opponent.

If someone really likes chess, they should definitely check this out; it uses some of the same mental skills but is a completely different game.

And the fact that you could play chess with it (just ignore the black holes) is just another plus.

One negative: I wish there were a nicer version of this that I could spend $100 on or so with really amazing fancy pieces.  The Z-Man edition is good quality, but for such a timeless game, yes, I want to be able to get a piece of decor that is this game, much like amazing chess sets.

The only reason I can't rate this higher is that, for some reason, I just am not drawn to actually play this game very often.  That might be mostly due to the fact that I just don't play abstract strategy games much unless I have someone to play it with on a regular basis.

RATING: 7.5
Production on this game is very good; the pieces are wonderfully produced. The gameplay is both simple and yet incredibly dynamic bits of gameplay can arise from the simple 4-point movement allotment. The fact that each piece moves in exactly the same way makes this a far easier game to teach younger children. Highly recommended.

I'm not sure I'd call it an alternative to chess but it's close. I'd rather play this with my kids than chess. Actually, I'd rather play this with anyone, other than another chess nut, than chess. It has better flow and balance than chess and requires more 'zone' thinking, like Go.

RATING: 7
Decently thick double-sided board, nice heavy durable pieces. They don't feel weighted, but they are heavy and make nice 'clacks'. They're felt-bottomed, as well. You can play animal-themed chess, but that is really where the comparisons between Arimaa and chess end. The similar look is deceptive - Arimaa is TOTALLY different.
You can move any piece in 4 directions, and get (min. 1, max. 4) moves per turn. There are octoquadragintillions of possible gamestates within only a dozen moves.
The depth of this game will only be understood if large numbers of people cooperate over time, and even then, it may be too abstract to ever allow discrete methodical approaches that work against a competent opponent.
Like life itself, Arimaa always fluctuates, sure plans sometimes backfire, and victories are sometimes pulled at the last moment. Thinking ahead isn't good enough. You must consider the possibilities and odds, as well as your opponent, in every moment.

A great great game. 1000+ plays on Arimaa.com (mostly bot games) and each game feels different from the last. Very deep gameplay and a slow but constant learning curve makes for a intense involving game. Playing against the various bots and trying to beat their varied playstyles is a blast.  

I haven't played in a while, and I am starting to wonder if I am ever going to get back into it because the online community is pretty dead these days.  As such, I have to lower my rating from a 10 :-(

This is one of the best abstracts I've ever played, and it lives up to the hype. Definitely not chess (which I hate).

Our first game took an hour but felt like it took 20 minutes, and it was intense. The rules are simple to learn, the pieces look good and have a nice heft, and there's a lot going on every turn.

The traps, the steps, and the other layers in Arimaa make playing it a deep and interesting experience.

This game is surprisingly deep for an abstract game with such simple rules. I vastly prefer it to chess as memorization of board positions is not a path to victory in Arimaa. The rabbit victory mechanics make for some extremely interesting battles and many come-from-behind victories. This game deserves a look from any strategy game fan, and certainly deserves to get more exposure. Wonderful website and online community.

Very interesting game; but the sheer number of options means that I'll end up slitting my wrists if I ever play this with a slow player. 

A couple of niggles: 
(1) it jars slightly that the elephant can't be captured (OK, yes, it it theoretically possible, but...)
(2) the end game can drag, even when the game appears won.

A couple of comments on the ZMan production - beautiful plumage, but not that practical.  Firstly, more contrast between the colours would have been nice; in dim light, it's hard to tell the silver from the gold.  Secondly, more height disparity would have been good.  You have to look carefully to see the difference between the camels and the horses, and between the dogs and the cats.

After three plays, I'm starting to see some interesting tricks and combinations. Arimaa is ridiculously simple to explain but seems to offer a ton of tricks to try and the same arc as Chess--an opening, a midgame, and and endgame--all of which added up to a rather satisfying third session. This was on the heels of a couple lackluster learning games, where it seemed either impossible or too easy to do anything. For now, I'm going to trust the upward trajectory and raise my rating. I think this one's a keeper.

[b]Theme: 4/5[/b]: For an abstract strategy, I kinda like the theme. Having a bunch of animals trying to get rabbit across to the other side is kinda cute. The animals being paralyzed in fear when near a larger animal is cool, and the fact that the bigger animals really do feel huge because of how they push and pull smaller animals to their will really makes you look at pieces like the elephant and camel with respect, while looking at weaker pieces like the cat with an almost lack of care, and the important weakest pieces like the rabbit as a special commodity that must be protected (...sometimes).

[b]Strategy: 5/5[/b]: I've played this game quite a bit, and it's not much like any abstract I've ever played. It may look like chess, but it plays nothing like it. It's pretty much in its own realm. Holding pieces hostages, determining whether to use elephants for offensive animal attacks or to get control over a trap, whether to let a hostage piece die and focus your efforts elsewhere... there's a lot to think about, and it's never clear what the best option may be. 

[b]Length: 4/5[/b]: I feel like this game always feel pretty quick. Even long games feel faster than expected because you're so focused on what's going on in game.

Arimaa is a game whose depth rivals that of Go. Very good, challenging, full-of-surprises, abstract strategy board game to make you think hard for hour and half if that is what you look for.
Deceptively and outwardly similar to chess but it is quite different from it's mother (chess gave birth to arimaa in a sense it was created within limits of chess board and pieces). Arimaa is way too deep.
Unlike go/baduk you don't need to play months before you realize what's going on on the board but that does not mean the game is simple and can be exhausted within few plays.
It has friendly community, developing sources for aspiring and serious players, and "humans are smarter than computers" kind of narrative behind it.
Well, what else you want?

This is a great abstract, completely different from Chess (to which it gets compared all the time... maybe because it is played with the same pieces on a similar board?) besides they are both abstracts.  No capturing here, instead a hierarchy of pushing/pulling pieces around.  No one can push the elephant, the camel can push all pieces but the elephant, the horses can push all pieces but the camel and elephant, etc.  Then there are pits, which are fun because you can wander over them if you have a "friend" nearby, but otherwise you fall in and die.  Also, larger pieces freeze smaller pieces unless a "friend" is nearby.  

These interaction effects make for an interesting fabric your pieces as a collective become.  Gaining an advantage can often be by isolating another piece from his "friends".  And all along the win condition of getting the rabbit to the other side means that you can have some breakaway surprise wins.  I was in one corner pushing all of my brother's pieces into a pit and in the meantime he was setting up the mad rabbit dash to the finish.  Fun and dynamic, plays much faster than other abstracts.  A good addition to the family.

This is one of the greatest abstract board games ever made, and time will tell if it will become my favorite game of all time (even when considering video games). It's simple, but deep, which is what many abstract board games are, but this one seems to take it to another level.

Its simplicity lies in the way your pieces move. You have four movement points to use in any way you want, but if an enemy piece is near one of your weaker isolated pieces, it is frozen until it is no longer isolated. Strong pieces can push or pull weaker pieces for two of their four movement points a turn.

The difference between this game and chess is that, in chess, because many pieces can move quite far, it can be a bit more difficult to tell what movements can screw you over. Maybe you temporarily remove defenses from the king, and then the enemy moves a brooke and queen across the board and manages to get a checkmate from seemingly nowhere. This game, however, does something different.

It's easy to tell what your opponent is capable of. They can move a total of four times a turn, so an enemy elephant on the other side of the board is in no way an immediate threat. What is a threat is the fact that multiple pieces can move during a single turn. So, even with a four movement point limit, a lot can be done by multiple pieces to completely turn to tide of war against you.

There is an amazing amount of depth to this game, including the topics of trap control, hostages, strongest free pieces, distribution of force, elephant blockades, advancing weak rabbits to free hostages so as not to risk a better piece. 

I may be biased, because I'm not a huge fan of chess (and therefore haven't looked too deeply at the in depth formations in it), but I honestly think this is the better game by far. 

It's easy to teach, but much, MUCH more complex than you would think a game about cute little animal pieces would be.

I don't get to play this in person, as none of the people whom I game with (including my wife, my only regular 2p opponent) is a fan of 2-player abstracts. But I have played a lot of games - usually "postal" (that is turn-based) ones - on arimaa.com, and am convinced that this is not only by far the best modern 2-player abstract, it is one of the greatest games ever in this category, much better than chess, and at least on a par with Go. It is well-understood enough that there are plenty of strategic resources out there to aid new players (and to help more experienced but still relatively weak players, such as me, to improve), so that one feels like one is actually playing according to a plan rather than just making random moves - but with still plenty of uncertainty as to even relatively fundamental principles, such that even the strongest players often disagree about the assessment of a position. Games between players of similar strength always feel like a tense struggle in which one slowly tries to improve one's position and make progress, while trying to prevent the opponent exploiting your weaknesses - but the game is almost never over until almost the very end, as twists and turns abound, and especially in the endgame, which can be quite explosive, and is unlike the endgame of any other abstract I can think of.

Arimaa is scandalously under-rated here on BGG. It certainly isn't a game that will interest most BGG users - but any with any interest at all in 2-player abstracts absolutely should give it a go. You will not regret it.

A great abstract game. I love the deliberate design to defeat computer analysis and prevent over analysis of openings, both of which killed chess for me. My only criticism of the game is that it can be played with a chess set. It makes one think it's a chess variant when it is a totally different game. I bought Z-man's very nice edition of the game so I won't be confused by chess pieces seeming to do strange things, e.g. an apparent king pushing an apparent queen into a trap space. It looks much nicer to see an elephant pushing a camel!

Arimaa is as good as you've heard and I recommend it to abstract game fans. 

The back story and the buzz drew me in. When the Z-Man boxed edition became available I grabbed it. Still, it sat on the shelf for a while before I had a willing opponent. My buddy is a good chess player and in short order he had figured how to make the most out of his four moves per turn. Move, move, move, move and he had transformed the board with a devastating combination. He beat me soundly and in doing so, showed me how to really play the game.

The one big shortcoming is that pieces aren't as distinctive as they should be. There should be more contrast between them, particularly in the height.

Arimaa surprised me in a number of ways but most of all in how claustrophobic the game feels yet there is still a large dynamic nature to the 4 action system that keeps it interesting.

I don't like chess at all but this is something I could be persuaded to play.

This game just never gets old for me. I have played 186 games against humans so far and I always find something new.

Not bad. I suspect my rating would go up if I could invest the time to really get into this game, but I just don't see myself grabbing this over any of my preferred abstracts (Yinsh, Tzaar).

Sold.

After a couple plays against an AI on boardspace, I don't enjoy this at all. It would've been just great, but the blocking rules (namely that you can't be blocked so long as you have a piece adjacent to you, regardless of how that piece compares to whatever is trying to block you) ruin it for me.

RATING: 7
It's playable with a chess set, but it's not a chess variant in any meaningful sense of the term. There's scope for creativity, though I worry a little bit that if played conservatively it is less interesting than chess, and it's not clear that interesting play is optimal. Anyway, if you like brain-burning abstracts, this one is pretty good, and you still have a good chance at beating the computers!

i love this game, the rules are so simple yet the strategy gets more and more complicated as the game goes along until your left with an open endgame in which aggression becomes the best tool.

i understand that people can say it is a waiting game, and it often starts out like that but within about 8 moves of any action it becomes a unique game which requires complete concenration. It can be played by 6 year olds, but chances are they will lose interest because its long and requires maturity to understand and appreciate

I've been playing this one a lot lately, and it's a very interesting game.  Capturing material is harder work than in e.g. chess, which means positional factors tend to dominate a larger part of the game, instead of tactical planning (though the game certainly has its share of tactics as well).  There is one major problem with the rules - the fact that repetition causes a loss.  This is a book-keeping headache, and seems contrived to me.  If repetitions tend to occur - then having a rule forbidding them seems like an ugly fix to hide a flaw in the game.  And if they don't tend to occur (which seems to be the case to me) - why have a rule turning the very rare repetition into a loss for one side or the other?  After all, there are two players involved in repeating a sequence of moves... not just one.

I recommend going to the website and playing this for anybody who's interested in abstract games - the rules are rather straight-forward, but the strategy isn't.  Not quite "a minute to learn, a lifetime to master" - but not far off as far as complexity goes.  I wish somebody would produce actual physical sets of this (and get them distributed in Europe so I could buy one - too many abstracts published by small companies are hard to get hold of).

*update* I lowered the rating for this, after getting back into it a bit, and finding that thoughts around the repetition rule are really annoying me.  What a shame for a game that otherwise holds a fair bit of promise!  Further playings, the game also feels overly defensive... could do with some minor rule changes to make it more offensive.

Designed to use the same board and pieces provided in a standard Chess set, Arimaa is intended to be difficult for computers to play while still being fun and easy for humans. The average number of moves at each turn in Arimaa is over 15,000 compared to about 30 for Chess. Yet humans have no difficulty finding the good moves. Computers struggle to see beyond 4 turns and aren't able to use opening books or end game tables.

Abstract game. Can be played with Chess set. Quite original.

RATING: 7
A well produced version of an essentially re-purposing chess pieces and an 8x8 board. With 4 moves per player's turn there is just so much more information and a real quality to well-developed strategies that are easier and frankly more fun to grasp. There's an intuitive quality to this game that frankly chess misses.

Z-man version has nice piece weight and board, but could've used a little more differentiation (height and/or bulk).  I'm still up in the air on the game itself. Definitely not chess-like, despite the obvious component inspiration.

Nice game but agonizingly long and convoluted.
Surely you have a huge amount of strategies to choose from and a wealth of moves among which pick the "less worse".
Too much chess like

Interesting and solid game.  I like that pieces can only push and pull each other around, rather than killing one another.  Of course, you can push or pull them into traps to eliminate them.  There's nothing quite as dramatic as the move in which your elephant helps a rabbit across a trap, but the rabbit freezes in terror on the other side, standing face-to-face with your opponent's own elephant.  Not to fear, the rabbit's own elephant steps onto the trap behind him to hold his paw and lend him confidence.  At the elephant's insistence, the rabbit hops forward to victory, but in so doing, has released the elephant, who plummets to his doom.
Er, yes, well, good game, basically is what I'm trying to say.  ...and I guess your imagination can go a little wild.

A chess-like game, but one that has a more dynamic board. I like the mechanics ( muliple actions, trap squares). It's slightly less interesting for me than chess or Navia Dratp.  I haven't played enough to fully develop cohesive strategies, but I am not really left with a desire to work them out.

A really good game....my kids ages 5-12 have taken to playing this daily and I'll join in as time allows.  Not a lot of strategy, since it's more like a war of attrition, but with 3 or more players informal alliances are always forming and breaking. I really value these small card-based games that don't take very long to play but have some interesting depth to them, esp. since these games are usually inexpensive.

Groovy art, simple war-ish card game. Making the noise does not make it better. Played....weak...nothing interesting. 

Maybe if the theme is stronger, I might have a better perspective of it. 

Naval battle is better.

Not played but I read the rules and was discouraged. Players have to make their own sound effects and it looks a lot like Avalon Hill's Naval War. Uh, no thanks.

A nice game that must be played lighthearted, or it bogs down and get really tedious. The big downtime between each players' turns is mitigated by the funny noises and the overall cartoonish style of the game. To be avoided at all costs with slow players.

A lot of fun, in the same general sort of way that Fluxx is a lot of fun. I'm sure I'd positively hate the game, if not for the lampoonish John Kovalic artwork.

very brutal!!
my rating is high because although this is not a briliant game it seems to be very short. it's pretty good fun so if you get taken out in the first 2 rounds or somthing, it's not usualy long before the game is over and you can have another crack at it. similar in style to bang, but there is a bit more of a game here.

If they hadn't Munchkinized the Artwork, this would get an 8 from me. The classic sci-fi design makes for me a much better gaming experience. Though my dislike of this design might originate from my really bad experiences with Munchkin, which I loath.

Second edition is very nice. This one, the 3rd edition, altough a good game really misses out. I really prefer a more serious appearence (like the first or second edition). Same game but really looks a whole lot better.

RATING: 6
shockingly good cardstock from ffg.  nice finish, seems very durable.  great artwork, clearly-written rules, and clear text on the cards.  from a production and presentation perspective, i don't see how the game could be considered anything other than a success.  the game itself, though, is quite subject to interpretation.  i suspect many people will hate it.  almost all of my local group does, and i probably won't be playing it very often.  i find it fast-playing, neighbor-screwing, painfully american, and amusing.  perhaps if people emphasized the negotiation aspects it would be more popular among its detractors.  no, probably not.

This game blows donkey balls.  It's way too random to even pretend to be strategic.  In fairness though, it is pretty fun to say, "Oh, sorry.  You forgot to say 'BEEEEP!' when you fired your laser at me.  I guess you missed."  The entertainment value of that wears off pretty quickly though.  Yeah, never mind, it's dumb.

I can't believe that this game has an average rating of 6.  Come on BGG, get your head in the game!

Some say it's unbalanced and crazy. I say: yes it is crazy, it is unbalanced, but that's all about in this one. But it's fast and fun - due to player elimination mechanism I won't rather try this with more than 3 players - otherwise waiting time of the player to be eliminated first could be far too long to play this game.

Fun little filler, but nothing I'd want to invest a lot of time into.  My six year old liked the idea of having to make the noise of blasts being fired for them to hit, but after a while it was kind of annoying.  Also annoying is not getting the draws from the deck that you want or need, so the random factor keeps this from being a 'good' game in my mind.

I had a blast playing a two-player game with my son. I can't wait to try it with more people. This has been compared to Bang! a game I know well. While there are some similarities, I see many differences that really separate the two. For one thing, you can't play Bang with two.

Helps fill the void of games that can handle 6+ players and aren't party games or Munchkin.  I wish they hadn't taken the silly art route though.

Don't let players get wrapped up in A/P issues. This game is not THAT hard. When down to the last two players, let them play 3 rounds against each other. If no winner has emerged, then the player with the highest total of points in ships remaining (including Command Ship) is the winner. If still a tie, flip a coin.

hmm, seems a bit long for filler and a bit weak to stand as a game. The difference between this and Bang! (well, there are quite a few) is that you are not playing a certain role that dictates your VC; there is no VC other than other players' demise. Once your ships get knocked out, it's a tough job to replenish them. Significant player elimination in this one.

An amusing little game, with lots of different cards and abilities going on.  It can be a little chaotic, and might be too random for some.  Also, the listed play time on the box is a considerable under-estimation, as 30-60 minutes seems more likely.

A definite beer and pretzels game. Love the new artwork, not so mad about some of the game balance issues. Critical hits for example, almost never ever have the right mix of cards to make these work. Still a good filler game, ideal for the end of the evening when the brain is dead.

I've played three games of this, and in each one I was eliminated before my third turn.  I didn't get many chances to use my command ship ability or to buy reinforcements.  It felt like the game ended just as it was getting started, instead of the siege-like drama I was expecting.  If you like this, I think you'll prefer [gameid=24167] or [gameid=13728]... I do.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
This is a tedious card game which belongs in the 70s. One wishes it had stayed there. Players are too hard to eliminate and therefore this game could go on and on for a very, very, very long time. We never finished our first game, and we probably will never play this again.

Another game that works best in small groups. It lags too much to enjoy it in a big game with the rules as presented. 

I may try borrowing some rules from Vampire: The Eternal Struggle, such as only attacking the player to your left, and maybe a reward for destroying that player. 

I have also come to the conclusion that certain races are utterly useless compared to the others. I'll be removing them from the possible options the next time that I play this.

This is really a depressing game, but I'll get to why in a second.
Mag Blast is a nice little filler.  I really love the card art, and the humor that is added in.  There was some confusion early on about the sector vs the turret color vs the target color, but that got cleared up.  The requirements to make sound effects when blasting is really cool...in theory

Now, the sad part......I thought I was able to make way cooler sound effects than I actually could.  Sad, pathetic, and lame are all words that spring to mind.  In all honesty, I think it applied to all of us.  One of those times when execution fell far short of anticipation.  Definitely not our finest hour.  (Sigh)  Had to be given away due to a lack of space, an unexpected move, and unreasonably high expectations.

Filler space combat card game.  Players take a mother ship, which an associated special power, then play cards to reinforce/protect the mother ship, and attack the other players.  A standard discard, draw, play cards type sequence of play, with the fleet ships type and positioning dictating what blast cards are fired against what flank of the target ships.  Gradually, the fleet is eroded away, exposing the mother ship.  Last man standing wins.  Fun stuff, great comic art, durable cards.

This is a decent card game for killing some time.  John Kovalic's art doesn't seem to be as good as in the Munchkin Cthulhu series and is very repetitive.

Groovy, simple little spaceship attack card game. The cartoon nature of the 3rd edition gives the whole game a whimsical feel (which is good for playing with non-gamers).

A really fun game on the same plain as Munchkin. Not deep at all, but a lot of fun for a pretty cheap price. 
Party game ONLY though. Not a good 2 or 3, or even 4 player game. It's a lot more fun to have 5 or 6 players have a FFA melee, with some home-brewed rule mods. 
I've really grown to enjoy the game, but I do feel the need to have some slight rule mods. Fun game to play at work with the kids. Fun and easy.

RATING: 2
Very fast and random. A little annoying how quickly one can be taken out of the game, within the space of two or three other peoples' turns sometimes. I wish there were more ways to avoid damage. The artwork makes me smile. 

I used to have this at a 7 back when I first got it in 2007. I've come to realize this isn't that good of a game, it's been rendered obsolete. It's very tedious scoping out your opponents' vulnerable zones, comparing them to your zones, comparing your cards in hand to the ships you have in your zones to see what you can fire, and then calculating the damage you can do before finally getting to the interesting part of thinking about whether your opponents have cards that can counter you or which ones present the greatest threat that you should attack. Think about it. If you're playing with four others you have to compare your four zones with sixteen of theirs each turn. The artwork isn't worth this. 

I finally sold my copy in 2014, years after I should have. Tons of games like Sentinels of the Multiverse have art that is as good. I think Take That games are entering obsolescence, so something Dice Tower likes such as Cash and Guns might be better. I would also recommend King of New York over this game because of the amount of damage you do to one another of its course and all of the other mechanics that are included that aren't have as fiddly as Mag Blast.

RATING: 7
This is a fun, light, comic book style, space opera of a game that requires little thought and a lot of luck. In a word cute. It's perfect for the time when you are waiting around for that fourth player to show up or when that game you were looking forward to finishing ends up being a blow-out and it's just too early to leave. Think of Mag-Blast as a charming game that takes 3 minutes to learn and 60 seconds to master.

A rather light game, somewhat similar to NAVAL BATTLES.  Easy to teach and play, but heavily dependant on card draw.  Most probably better with more players.

Willing to give this one another try, with 4 or more players.

This feels like a space version of "Naval Battles". Instead of setting up three lines of ships, the players arrange four ships orthogonally around their command ship. Then players dish out damage cards on the other players in a up to six-player free-for-all cut-throat. Winner is the last command ship in play. The starting fleet you get is completely random, instead of "buying" a fleet from a set number of points, and it is almost impossible to get a new ship before being eliminated. There is no rhyme or reason to go after anyone in particular--just blast each other, while making stupid weapon noises. In Naval Battles, at least you are trying to accumulate 25 victory points worth of destroyed ships. Here, you don't. Destroyed ships open up flanks, which expose the command ship to enemy fire. Total chaos, with virtually no strategy. In a 6-player newbie game with at least 3 AP players, I managed to get 3 turns in 30 minutes before being eliminated--and that's a blessing, because the game went on for another 45 minutes! I've learned that I will now avoid any game with artwork from John Kovalic (i.e. Munchkin, Star Munchkin, etc.). I will assume from now on that any game associated with his artwork is just plain stupid and a waste of my time.

Light card games seem to be ten a penny now and this incarnation is no better than any of the others. Constant reinforcement with new ships means that the end can be a long time coming in a pretty montonous game.

First played December 25th, 2007. Taught in about 10min, played in about 30 min in a two player game. This will take a game play to figure out how the mechanics work. It has decent strategy/luck ratio. You battle your opponents, trying to destroy their command ship before they do it to yours. First you choose a command ship (which has hull strength[HS] of 8; and a special ability). Then pick 4 of 6 fleet ships to protect your command ship and issue attacks (which have speed, HS, turrets, and ship type]. Finally each players is dealt a hand of 5 action cards (including blast cards [turret color restriction], reinforcement icons, squadrons [fighter/bomber, require carrier], direct hit cards, repell blast/squadron/direct hit cards, and direct hit effect cards [auto-destroy,claim fleet, etc]. On your turn, discard, draw (up to 5 cards, counting hand), reinforcements (including special card, and 3 like/same symbol action cards), maneuver (requires speed/zone), and attack (play blast, squadon cards). I'd recommend giving this a gameplay and consideration in purchase. I'm sure it plays better with more people.

It's like Bang! in space, but it doesn't suck.

Mag Blast is your standard take-that card game that really just boils down to luck of the draw with the occassional "whom to attack with what combo" strategy.  It's quick, fun, silly, and most importantly - painless.  I would definitely consider this the type of design Bang! was going for except that it succeeded.  I can think of few better fillers for medium sized groups.

Don't ever let people treat this game seriously, or they will block 2 hours of your gaming night with it. Serioulsy, I've seen two guys playing it for 90 minutes and treating it awfully cerebral, after the rest of us (4 people, I think) had eliminated each other within the first 20 minutes.

It was the original Mag Blast that introduced me to these types of card games years ago.  One hot night in Tallahassee, FL with a boyfriend I met in New Orleans.  There we sat at his friend's bar playing this while some kid was working on a chain mail bracelet beside us.  I couldn't remember the name of it for about two years.  Now I am pleased to own my own copy.  This game is a lot of fun. And it brings back memories of my travels.  What can I say?

Another entry in the Naval War genre of card games.  The two innovations here are fighter/bomber cards which recycle back to a player's hand if not shot down and a mechanic for cashing in sets of cards to obtain reinforcement ships.  The second feature is a nice element and gives players something to do with otherwise "dead" cards.

I prefer Star Force Terra (3W) as a game, because SFT gives a player a shield roll to save against each and every attack.  This gives a player who gets ganged up upon a fighting chance.

SFT also possesses better victory conditions - MagBlast is about player elimination while SFT is played for points.  Players in SFT have more incentive to act and the game rewards turtling less, which creates a better play dynamic.

Mag-Blast is constantly referred as "Bang! in space". While they do share mechanical similarities, at their core, offer different experiences.

The main drawback of Mag-Blast is that the combat is so brutal that's virtually unplayable with more than four players. With five or more, someone will be eliminated without even playing a single turn.

What's great about it is its tactical nature: the possibility of manoeuvring your ships is where the game's meat relies. Moving ships around your ship, striking where it hurts the most, is crucial. Newbies tend to not move around much, which makes the game both less fun and hurts its balance. If players don't move their ships, the one with the greatest number of dreadnoughts wins. But if they do, said player will be the one to go down first.

Temporary alliances and negotiations are completely necessary to keep the balance. Whomever has the strongest position should be the one focused on eliminating players. Those who are falling behind should work together in order to live another day, to turn the tables.

Cards are of good quality, though a bit on the thin side. Meanwhile the cartoony illustrations fit the game like a glove. 

Oh, and the famous rule of having to make the sound of the blasts you fire isn't necessary at all, but it's fun and leads to hilarious moments. Apply as you see fit. For instance, in my group we consider it as "heavily recommended to do the sounds, but not strictly required".

Mag-Blast excels as a light confrontation-driven card game. I definitely recommended it, but only for groups of three or four players.

"If you don't make a space gun noise when you shoot, you miss" -- that rule tells you everything you need to know about Mag-Blast. Nearly everyone I've introduced this to has subsequently bought a copy.

Despite the fact that it's too easy to sideline one player right off the bat, this is a fun little game. There's just something about it that you can't argue with -- it's unabashedly silly, and it works.

It stayed on the shelf for years, though. There are lots of games I'd rather play in the same amount of time, and when it was clear Mag-Blast was dead I sold it.

I like Mag-Blast better than two similar games I've owned and enjoyed, "Light Speed" and "Space Station Assault," because there are more factors and possibilities involved in how to attack and defend, the rules are more streamlined and intuitive, and the results quicker to establish, plus the artwork on the 3rd Edition and the overall sense of fun comes through in how the game plays. It also rightly plays quickly, which a light card game of this nature should, so, among other things, it is pretty easy to teach and get others to play. Traded for, February 2010.

It's meant to be quick - but our 6 player game dragged on with little to do when it's not your turn, and bad downtime whilst each player starts their turn replenishing and perusing cards. Then go whacking the player on either side. No brain required. In fact, no brain desired to enjoy this one.

Mag Blast 3rd is a fun game with suiting illustration that make it even more fun. It's a good BANG! subsitute but not quite as good. It lacks some finesse which it traded for some deeper strategy. It's not as elegant as BANG! but it's still a great fun to play. Long live the Glorp!

Fun game, better in groups of 3-4 or more. Two player games are over too soon and the squadrons throw smaller games out of balance. Also, I'm not a huge fan of the uber-cartoony art style this game shares with Munchkin. I know a lot of people like that style, but it just looks too greeting-card for me. Otherwise, good stuff. Not too tough to teach, lots of ways to play. A nice, light game. Not as chaotic or crazy-silly as they'd have you believe.

If you like Munchkin style games, this may be for you (I do not like them). Basically, try and shoot down your opponent before he shoots you. Each leader has a special ability and ships can only shoot based on where they are (left ship shoots the left side of your opponent, etc). Kind of bland.

A good duel and 4 player space themed card game where you control a fleet of ships and try to eliminate the other players.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
It really does feel like a simpler/streamlined take on Bang! I guess this is mainly due to the way the "Blast" cards are played. This is certainly easier to teach, and the fact that you have more than one ship to soak up hits means that, while player elimination is still an issue, there is more you can do to protect yourself.

There are some optional rules to help keep players involved for longer when playing in a larger group. It even plays quite well with just 2 players, which can't be said for Bang!

The main negative is that there isn't quite as much variety in the card selection as there is even in just the base game of Bang!

OWN: 3rd Edition.

GREAT FUN WITH THE KIDS
A light but fun card game of space fleet battles.  This is one of my 8YO son's favorites, which I also enjoy quite a bit.  A very good after dinner and before bed game.  Avoid playing with people who take getting blown up personally, there is player elimination here.  Some folks criticize the 3d edition artwork as cartoony (I think mainly those who played the 2nd Edition first).  I think think the art matches the game perfectly given the light play and requirement that you must make a sound effect for a blast to take effect (goofy art for a goofy game).  For those of you that object to making noises while you play as lame, I suggest you go play a game of Puerto Rico.

This game relies on playing with four or fewer players and that those players can see the fun in the game. That said, the knockout aspect of this game is never a popular one and needs to be tweaked to find a near instant resolution to the game. It might even make a decent Pandemic type solo game.

John Kovalic did very well in all Munchkin series. But here, in Mag Blast he didn't. I don't know how 1st and 2nd editions are works, but Mag Blast it's nothing special. There's no scale in this game. Ex, if you play with 5 other players and if they want to kill your ship 1st, you'll die no chance to survive. So, after when you already dead, you can just watch game and begin bored.

I was expecting this to be a riot, yet it fell completely flat. I should have gotten the second edition instead (with its true sci-fi feel), since this goofy and cartoonish third edition only made a mockery of epic space battles.

Played this with my board game club for teens this week and had a lot of fun. It took us a while to learn the rules completely (there were 5 of us playing and none of us had played before and trying to get everyone to focus wasn't easy) but once things got rolling everyone seemed to really enjoy it. The only problem I saw was that it's easy to gang up on one person and kick them out of the game early and then they have nothing to do while the game finishes. But once everyone knows the rules it should play quickly enough that it's not much of a problem.

RATING: 5
[FFG 06 edition] {Beer&Pretzels, Space; fighting, player-elimination, hand-management, variable-player-power; optimal 3-4p} Mag-blast 3rd edition is a hilarious fighting game. It's so short and fast-paced that player elimination is not a problem (as long as there are fewer than 5 players). Actually, player elimination is the main fun for this game.  The rule is quite easy to learn but it takes some time to explain the different elements in attack part: blast, direct hit, defend, squadrons, etc.  The sound making rule is fun in the first few turns, but it becomes annoying afterwards.

Mag-blast is also a hand management game.  As there are various kinds of cards, players need some time to understand the cards.  Players have to manage hand wisely so as to attack other players (aggressive play) or to collect resources for reinforcement (defensive play).

I will never play this game again with more than 5 players.  I tried several games with 5 or more players. It's boring if free-for-all play is used because an eliminated player may need to wait for a long time.  And, down-time between turn is strong.

The quality of the cards is very good - color, sturdy and linen-finished. The illustration is cute.  It is worth the price. 

[Variants] I prefer Controlled Carnage; at least, it won't make me the common target. Brutal barrage is not very special until late game, during which players have more cards.

Comic card game of space combat.  Works well with 2-8 players.  Don't forget to make a blast sound when shooting!  Sometimes seems to drag towards the end, if players focus more on building up fleets as opposed to blasting each other.

Not bad for a light 'take that' game; its got a fair bit going on.  I think its better the faster people are playing; this is a game that doesn't need a lot of thought!

Fun game - however, it needs to be played with people who play it quickly, otherwise it drags into the area of painfulness.

This is a card game where each player plays an alien fleet out to destroy the other fleets.  Each alien fleet has different abilities.  Some abilities are more powerful and can only be used a limited number of times per game.  Some are less powerful, but have no limit on the number of times you can use it.  You need to play cards to fire the guns on your ship at the enemy or launch fighters or bombers.  

Ships are drawn randomly.  Different ships have different stats.  Dreadnaughts have big guns and take a lot of damage, but have no maneuverability, cruisers are average all around and destroyers have the smallest guns, but great maneuverability.  There are also some specialised ships with special abilities.

This game is meant to be a casual, fun game.  You are supposed to make laser gun noises when you play your cards that fire your weapons.  The balance isn't there as some abilities are more powerful than others.  The game plays up to 8 players.  Depending on the number of players, some fleet abilities are more powerful than others.  Often, having a bad draw on your initial ships plays a significant factor on your ability to win.  If you draw a bunch of destroyers and small ships while your opponent draws a bunch of dreadnaughts, you are not very likely to win.

Probably THE most-played game in my collection. No weekend gaming trip to my buddy's house is complete without a few hands of this.  I've probably given this to more people than any other game with the possible exception of OGRE.  A great take-that game.  My rating is a bit lower than the second edition because of the "humorous" art by John Kovalic; it's not as good as the well-themed Twilight Imperium science fiction artwork in the second edition.  The cards, however, are physically better-made, with a nice linen finish, and there has been a bit of tweaking with existing cards and a few new cards as well.  If you can't get the second edition, go ahead and get this; it's a great take-that game.

This is a fairly silly game in which the players get to blast each other out of space.  The game definitely lends itself to picking on the weak, since you don't want to waste your shots, and killing someone off is usually better than just damaging someone else.  Good light fun.

A fun game, but player elimination can leave you with a bored gamer. I'd reccomand maxing this out at 4 or five players, too long with more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.8
This is a great game. Elimination can be a downer, and I think some powers overpoweredÂ… Only time will tell, but setup is painless and play is quick. I can't wait to see the way balancing is achieved with 4 players. (Same as 2nd ed.)  I was a sucker for the Kovalic artwork and the cool races.

RATING: 6
Excellent! Well packaged, durable cards. Same as any other Mag Blast, with a a few tweaked/new cards. Special card rules are printed on the cards that need it. All game cards should be made to this standard.

More plays in, and this is only really fun with a group that's willing to go all-out on the noises and play it fast and loose. Play it with someone hell-bent on maximizing every hand and it drags. The decisions just aren't interesting and varied enough to spend more than an hour or so playing.

Я как-то подумал что в коллекции надо иметь миниатюрные игры. В список сразу вошли: Mag Blast, Citadels (уже были), Iliad, Dixit 2. Ну игросказ наверное тоже попадает в эту категорию. Хотелись еще Pocket Battles, но на поверку были забракованы.

This is a keeper. Lots of fun, simple, and exciting while offering some tactical choices: blasts must be fired from color-coded turrets, most ships can move around the command ship to plug holes, and some cards can be played in sequence to enhance the attack effect.

Quick, chaotic, highly random game of space destruction. Good as a filler between other games. Needs lots of trash talk and hamming it up to make it fun. Kovalic's artwork adds to the entertainment value. Not recommended for gamers who cannot let go of their serious sides in gaming.

A blast for lunchtime at work! Three of us average 3-4 games during lunch break. We use the Brutal Barrage rule the entire game. Favorite races: Freep, Recyclons. Least favorite: Cranium. Favorite action card: The Spock card! (Help me, Spock!) Least favorite action card: Ramming Speed.
Good work de-stresser.

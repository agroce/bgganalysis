A tense bluffing mental competition on an abstract board.  I think this game is criminally under mentioned on the Geek.  I see how people don't like "blind" bidding and stuff, but I find that I often like mechanics I typically dislike -- when someone builds a good game focused on just that one mechanic.  

See Snorta.

An oldie, but a goody. For whatever reason, I've dragged this around for many years, not wanting to get rid of it because I remembered thinking it was a really good game when I was younger. Now, having a new "eurogame" perspective on things, I dragged it out and played at my group. The verdict? Great game! Way ahead of it's time and much closer to a German game than you would expect from a mainstream american game from the '80s.

I really like this game. Even with simple components (Board, Busts of Spies, Briefcase, Bank Books) it's fascinating because with such interesting looking characters and exotic settings, it's possible to tell cool stories that explain the game events. The table talk and negotiating that go on, as well as the fact that the in-game value of each piece is simultaneously hidden and constantly changing, is capitvating. Talk about unlimited replay value!

A friend of mine just picked up a copy of this at Goodwill for $1.50. This game can run pretty quick, usually people have to strategize together to keep another person from winning. Usually it comes close to each person winning, going back and forth until someone succeeds in outwitting the others. Lots of bluffing, betting, and strategy. There's zero luck in this game, just information unknown to you (like Stratego). I'm very surprised that this never took off as a popular game; if it had been released today, it probably would have.

Played the Sigma File version of this from 1973. It looked like that old too but the gameplay was really quite clever and new to me. Good fun of bluffing and double bluffing while taking control of the agents to hopefully get the file back to your home city. 3 Plays.

Wonderfully simple rules: Either move an agent (picking up the briefcase if located in the same city), assassinate an agent (when two agents are located together - costs £1,000) or make a secret payment to any agent (you start with £10,000). Challenge moves and assassinations by others if you think you have control by gradually revealing how much you've paid. Get the briefcase to your base to win.

I had Gibson Games' Sigma File though Amigo's Casablanca is visually a lot better. Played this a lot in the early 80's. Good fun with four experienced players. New players can easily throw the game by not teaming up to prevent the Sigma File from reaching someone's base.

Alright. I'm ready to make a ruling on this one. This game went from "huh" to "intriguing filler" to "favorite auction game" in the space of about ten plays. There's just so much here. The way the emergent partnerships collapse distance is alone worth writing home about, but it doesn't stop there. The deductions and initial bids are surprisingly chewy, likewise for the action economy. I want nothing more than to have another twenty plays of this and write up a long strategy article and review. I can't think of any higher praise than that.

Super components and theme together do not make a great game.  The blind bidding and crazy assassinations, betrayals, symmetrical map and simutaneous, pre-plotted player movements, makes this just a chaotic, random mess. Who gets to move that spy? Whoever had blindly bid more! Now I pay him more and he moves back to my HQ. Oops, a math error in the secret Swiss bank account means those moves are invalid. What? Who has that calculator? Just a crazy game and I recommend to just avoid this.

Conspiracy is a rather simple 'pay off the spy' game. The interaction between players is huge in this game, and super fun.  You really have to balance the spies that you move in relation to the spies you might encounter that might try to kill you off!  Cunning, deception and wit are all necessary to make this work.  (Not to mention honesty, which you need when bidding). Actually, as bidding games go, this one probably requires the most honesty. Shows its age, but quite good for a 40-year-old game!

Having only played a short game of Casablanca, it is hard to comment generally on this game.  It seemed a little random as to who really controlled an agent and whether someone else would try to assasinate your agent, which can easily be done if the players work together.  A game of bluff and bribes very similar to Kremlin, Casablanca could have some replayability once people become familiar with good strategies.

Description: Enter a world of intrigue and assassination as players bribe agents to bring them the Top Secret suitcase.

Pro: Complex game of bluffing, investment, and picking your moments. Elegantly simple rules allow focusing on politics and player interaction. Neat two-faced plastic busts for agents, and a tiny plastic suitcase. Mechanics fit theme well.

Con: Would be better with art for each city. Paper-and-pen tracking of bribes can get messy. No special actions to add variety and complexity.

My score's in flux at the moment. I want to try it again, but in two plays, Conspiracy didn't seem to achieve what it was hoping to get from us. In our first game, three of us let another player put a few thousand dollars on one spy and walk away with the game with record speed. In the second game, we all conspired against him openly and often. The door was left wide open for one of our triumvirate to swoop in right as we succeeded in stopping the first player. I want to give it a try or few more to see if I'm missing the strategy, or the game itself is missing the mark. A definite plus is the look of the game. Like Quarto, there's a simple elegance to the bank books and the busts of the spies.

Never seen people be so SERIOUS when playing a game... It doesn't seem like fun, more like work

Otherwise rare and amusing game I found at a thrift shop.  You get X amount of money, which you allocate to bribe spies to control them and move them towards you.  When you and another player both want to move the same spy, you have a small bidding war, to see who gets to move him, so choose your money wisely.

Well, after the first play it seems to be a game with simple rules, but intricate strategy at the 4 player level.  I like how it only encourages table talk in times of "crisis" when a player is about to win.  Otherwise, it seems wise to keep your position secret and your strategy as disguised as possible.  Certainly a "window of opportunity" exists during which you want to pay the spies.  Too early and you run the risk of loss of capital.  Too late, and you could be left without the ability to make a needed block, or take advantage of good board position.Its like Kill Doctor Lucky, with a bit less chaos, but also with more hidden information.

Solid game of bluffing, maneuver and patience.  Players are trying to get the secret briefcase to their base and on their turn can pay off one of the eight spies, move a spy or kill a spy.  The catch is that, in turn-order, the other players can block your move or assassination attempt.  How? by having paid the spy more money (payoffs are tallied secretly in a bank book).  

As the game progresses the spies get killed off (as do your investments in them) and the game comes down to who has the most control of the remaining spies.  At this point the game can get silly and frustrating but everything up to this point is quite a bit of fun.

This game can be a little frustrating due to that factor, but it fits the theme and really makes the game work.  It has its flaws; I have not played it enough to give it higher than this rating.

Boasting one of the most unusual drivers in any game, The Sigma File is a short, explosive, nasty and hilarious example of psychological torture where up to four players can bribe eight agents and make one of them take a treasured suitcase from the centre of the board to its home corner (say "from Tangier to their hometown"). 

In any turn there are three options: moving an agent, moving an agent to eliminate another one (say "sending them to the Bahamas") at the cost of some of its bribe money, or spending the turn making all bribes that the player wants (as long as the bids in their money reservoir haven't been used up). The big problem is that to do anything other than bribing, the player who believes they've put the most money on the agent to be used has to agree, otherwise players have got to prove who's made the biggest bribe (and so reveal how much they've put on which agent).

This game has got some history: it started as a rather crude pencil and paper game named Subterfuge, then it became The Sigma File (Agent in Germany), then it got some modifications and was released as Conspiracy, and it finally came as a last German edition with the name of Casablanca. The ultimate version to go to is very probably the Sigma File / Agent one (ignore the German rules here, they result in a broken game! Use the ones in English).

This game is truly cutthroat.  Lies, obfuscations, veiled and unveiled threats ... I've seen it almost ruin friendships if the wrong mix of personalities are playing... it brings out the worst in some people.  But, it is one of the only games where you can end out joining in on an open plan to (temporarily) defeat yourself since so much of the dealing and strategizing is open table-talk: at times, it is in your own interest to point out that the other players' plan will help only one of them win and thus they "need" your cooperation if their plan (originally to stop you) is not going to throw the game to (only) one of them -- the logic and sequences are quite fun when this happens.  And that experience, of actually joining a conspiracy that is targeting you, is something quite extraordinary for a game. (Though I imagine Diplomacy has such moments as well.) :-)

I have the Gibson's Games edition titled "Sigma File".
The board is a map of the world. Four players represent UK, USA, USSR, and China. They have to get the Sigma File back from Cairo to their capital city (London, Washington, Peking, Moscow). The agents start one link either side of the player capitals.
The network of locations is not laid out symmetrically. The network links are flight paths, and these often cross over each other so that the symmetric nature of the net is not apparent unless you study the board carefully. 
To win you need to to move any agent carrying the Sigma File back to your capital on your turn. Another player moving the File to your capital on his turn does not trigger a win for you.

The "Casablanca" edition changes the setup and victory conditions, and allows up to 8 players. The 8 agents start, two each, on 4 bases, the equivalent of the capital cities in the Gibson Games version. The players try to get any agent with the file back to the *agent's* starting base. The player who has bribed that agent the most money wins. 

This "Casablanca" variant could be used with the Gibson Games version too, allowing up to 8 to play:
- start two agents each in London, Moscow, Peking and Washington.
- make a publicly-visible note of which agents start where.
- when a player moves an agent an the file onto one of these starting capital cities, the player who has bribed that agent most wins. The player who actually moved the agent breaks any ties.

RATING: N/A
Garage sale find for $1. I probably overpaid. From reading the rules, it seemed like someone tried to be way too thematic with the game design at the expense of balance. I haven't played it to give it a fair shake though, although I can't say my expectations are exceedingly high.

Tentative rating: 3/10 after reading the rules. Just not seeing how it's good. Maybe it will surprise me if I ever play it.

This really is an underappreciated game.  I guess someone could look at it as a "I move, but you move me back" sort of a game... but there is a strong underlying complexity to that. We have found our games to be very tense. The theme fits well, it has a great little storyline in the player biographies and it has a pretty good degree of socialization.

Surprisingly good.  Wasn't too sure what I would think of it from hearing the rules read, but something clicked once the game started.  It's got the bluff of poker, but more tactical.  We played with three; I imagine with four the groupthink will play a stronger part.  All in all, it's not like too many other games, and there's an elegant simplicity to it.

RATING: 9
This has to be played with four players to be enjoyable, but it's a blast when it works right.  With no strategy, it's sort of a random game.  But once the bluffing starts, the whole nature of the game comes to life.  I'm a sucker for anything with a spy theme... and this game captures the double-agents, the double-crosses, the suspense, the untrustworthy...  And as soon as you do trust a spy (because you've paid them a ridiculous amount of money) they get assasinated by your opponent!

I play the 1973 Condor (Network map not the globe map one) version with a RPG group on occasion, and we always slip into the standard clichéd national roles from the 1970s  (mentions of Comrade, Stiff Upper Lip, Yellow Peril, Reds Under the Bed, Shaken Not Stirred etc.) and another rule we have is that once an agent is killed a suitably daft spy method has to be described by the assassinating player (e.g. I killed Francis Pym in Berlin with Cyanide Bubble bath) this always adds to the fun.

This deserves to be a much more well-known game, as there is a whole lot of tactics to deploy within the framework of this fantastic game. 

The only drawback I can think of, is that the players must NOT cheat on their banking slip. Probably my favourite board game ever, despite me not winning yet after over a dozen plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
No dice, no cards, just the players, their wits, and a whole lot of table talk. How are you going to manage your cash? Pay too much out to one spy and his cover might get blown, flushing those $$$ down the drain; but if you don't pay enough out, you'll have no sway (while still having wasted some of your $$$). You'll almost certainly need to cooperate with one or two other players to stop someone from winning, but be careful not to trust anyone too much!

I should probably give this a lower rating, because this game can have a big kingmaker problem at the end.  

My rating is based on how much fun it is, until the point where it isn't.  Because of your limited funds, you become effectively eliminated throughout the game.  

The ending can be much more protracted than it needs to be.

Still, I really liked it.

Usually I am a believer in the "it's finished when there is nothing left to take away" school of game design, so in theory this should be up my alley. It's essentially the shared control mechanism from Kremlin stripped of everything else: players collaboratively bribe agents and can move them wherever they like -- unless another player who has paid more money countermands the order. These bids are secret and can be increased during play. If an agent gets the MacGuffin to their home base then the game ends and the player in control wins.

It's ultimately a bluffing game that's enjoyable in the middle but offers not quite enough control. I think it would be better with hidden teams, a la [redacted]. It's also highly abstract, lacking the thematic trappings that make Kremlin so enjoyable.

Pelikan "Agent" edition.

There are 8 spies and they are all pretty much quadruple agents.  You just want one of them to bring the secret documents to you. If you pay them the most they definitely will. Sort of negotiation. Bash-the-leader until someone wins. Pretty quick and fun 2010/01

A solid bluffing and deduction game. Managing your finances can be a bit of a tight rope act. Figuring out if that guy you're moving into position is really in your pocket is a thrill ride, even moreso when you move in someone that you have no funds invested into hoping to provoke a misplaced assassination... but what if he's working for someone else and they take advantage of the position? 

It isn't the heaviest game. It isn't without its flaws (you need to play with 2 or 4 since the board layout doesn't work well for 3, and the case can have a bad habit of moving in circles for a while without any significant developments). Still, it's a fun game that I wouldn't turn down with the right group.

There's initial bluffing, or someone moves a piece that is a feint to reduce the board or to bait someone into moving and committing funds. Any change in the game state is effective as a bit of paranoia sets in. It's such a small constrained board, any move rises suspicion. And no move at all and scribbling (or more delicious, pretending to scribble) in the little notebook with such rapid assurance raises them even more. 

At some point someone tries to make a break, or starts killing people or moving them out of the way to clear a pathway to their 'home goal.' To do this there's some commitment of resources (to preserve your next turn), or a pretense of assigning resources (so you aren't challenged even if you have no money on anyone you're moving).

Then there's a ripple of panic as people shift to block. Now when they do that, there's the puzzle of whether they'd invested in these blocking shifts. If you did your bluff well, they haven't, you challenge, and if they loose a turn that translates into maneuvering room because you've cut one of the cooperative players out of the next turn and that may clear the way for you to make a break. Or at least do a bit more shifting to clear the path for the next opportunity.

Another thing about the game - as soon as someone tries to either clear a path or grab the suitcase and move it in their direction, the rest of the players have to cooperate to stop it. Another psychological shift as the suspicions are disbanded for the common goal. And in that process you learn where each other resources are, or attempt even more bluff with those you're cooperating with ("Well, I could help except I've invested alot in Ahmed, but he's way over here" when you haven't vested a dime in Ahmed.), or position them to waste some of their bank account or loose a turn in preparation for your own attempt to grab control.

All this is socked into a game that is roughly 40 minutes long. It's wonderfully compressed.

I even think it'd be a good game to homebrew. Clay heads! 

I love the bluff. I love misdirection at the gaming table. Getting faked out or vice-versa are the ripples in-game that, win or lose, make a game like this worth it. As is the moment you have thee clarity of a clear path and can dump your entire bank account into your suitcase carrier because the only way to stop you are move challenges (ie: you don't have to invest in possible killers for the run home).

I love this game (Sigma File to me being a Brit). I played it back in the early 80's, and it was the first game I bought when I returned to board gaming after a 10 year break. But shock horror where were the big heads I remembered? My new copy had a set of anonymous figures. This disappointment could not spoil a great game, I have now got a copy of the original Big Head version thanks to the wonder that is eBay.

The game is simple, move a briefcase (containing the Sigma File) to your home base using the 8 spies. You secretly allocate your £10,000 budget to bribe the spies so you can control them or use them to assassinate other spies for £1,000. Each turn you can move, bribe or assassinate.

The fun is in bluffing and double crossing your opponent, assassinating someones top spy or guessing how others have spent their money and trying to spend your money wisely. Sometimes the killings only leave a couple of spies standing, have you got any money left to bribe the survivors?

You have to have players who are honest as all bribes are secret until the post mortem where you realise how you have been duped or whether you have been cunning enough to fool your fellow players.

The game is so simple, I created a travel version with a geometric board on a page of paper, some coloured counters, and paper and pencil, so you can play this anywhere!

RATING: 9
Update:  Played a few times now, and it all seems pretty balanced.  The Finnish line is very strong and needs to be watched carefully.  The DSB can be tricky to dig out of Copenhagen,  but if handled right,  can end up as the most powerful.  Good stuff.

Only one game of 2-player so far.  The ore token is very powerful,  but not enough to unbalance.  There is a lot going on here - it feels significantly more complex than 18AL,  but preversely,  plays faster.  We got a couple of rules wrong (as usual),  but these will be fixed for our next outing.  Excellent 18xx variant,  and there appear to be a lot of potential strategies available.  I'll enjoy trying them,  even if they don't work!

RATING: 4
This game is basically the same as all the other gamekits (the good ones, anyway): interesting ideas, usually well-integrated with the 18xx format, but inadequately playtested with non-hardcore 18xx fans and so with too many pointy bits and rough edges. These games are designed for the 18xx faithful, not the general gamer or the casual fan. I think that for the serious 18xxer, 18Scan will offer interesting variety. For the 18xx newbie or 18xx casual fan, though, don't bother. This was apparently designed as an intro 18xx game, but it misses the mark severely on this count, in large part due to the unbalanced private company auction. Also, the playtime estimate is outrageously optimistic;  for us, 3 long-time 18xx veterans, it took 4 hours, which was at least 90 minutes past the game's expiration date.

This is one of the better "short" 18xx titles I've played.

The track flexibility is tight, with only one option for yellow town track, or for yellow city track. The upgrades become a more thoughtful decision than many games.

Also, the initial auction of privates and minor companies is interesting and clean. The game provides multiple ways to generate early income, adding some replay value that seems lacking in some of the other small 18xx titles.

RATING: 5
18Scan is a shorter 18XX game that is more along the lines of the 1829 / operations branch versus the stock centred 1830 branch. The map is small and there are only 6 public companies, one of which is a borg that doesn't form until phase 5. The early game focuses on 3 minor companies which are forced to run 50/50 payout runs, and which also have a strong incentive to go to destinations as it gets them a free railhead. In phase 5, these 3 minors are folded into the state railway, which inherits all of their cash, trains, railheads, and special tokens.

Random other hooks of note include dual-sided trains that have an expensive option and a cheap option with the expensive side always being a whole number and the cheap side always have an X+Z number structure with a big city + small city allowance for runs. The privates are scant, only 3, and 2 of them provide sizable bonuses with their chits, one being a bonus for running over the ferry, the other for serving an off-board mine.

So, for a first time player there's a lot to like. I'm amazed that this was ever touted as a beginner's map though. It's short, but there are way too many side rules here for people who don't already have some familiarity with the game system. I enjoyed my first play, but I can't rate this very highly because the game seems like it is way too scripted and I don't feel any need to play it again. The 3 minors are almost always going to want to lay out their routes in a similar way to their destinations because of the incentives involved (free railhead, bonus run). As a result, the borg is always going to have a similar network when it shows up, as those 3 companies fold into it. As for the other companies, the company adjacent to the mine is always going to lay a triangle of track around it, and so on. These track decisions seem to be dictated; not only because of the destination bonus, but moreso by the insane tile manifest that has no "straight through or gentle curve through the large city" tiles as part of the yellow manifest. The only large cities available force the track into odd acute angle turns and seem to handcuff track laying decisions. There are still some interesting factors: i.e.: token placements can be interesting, and the need to get the right train to the right company for the end game, but I still think games will develop similarly from outing to outing and feel like I've seen enough here.

This game is the first and 9so far) only  18xx-style rail game that I've played. It's not what I expected -- I like the stock buying/corporation controlling aspect of the game. Laying track is fun, too. Would definitely play other rail games now.

These games are usually too long to get to the table often enough; this one is a touch quicker.

18Scan was designed as an introductory game to the 18XX system and works relatively well; however the common theme of finding the right number of players applies here too.  I don't really know the sweet spot; I only know when we played there was that one player doing nothing for a very long time.  Not many of my friends appreciate the lack of involvement.

RATING: 6
Building track is rather uninteresting since there is only a small number of different tiles, and all of those are available in rather large quantities. Additionally, the map is rather restrictive in many parts, making the on-board play somewhat scripted.

The rules for the stock market and floating companies are a nice change of pace, though: New companies can be started with as little as 20% of the shares sold, and there is no simple arbitrage because shares cost the same no matter whether they come from the bank or the pool.

18Scan is a rather nice introduction to the stock market of 18xx simply because players can neglect the tracks to a large extent. Other than that, though, 1825 seems like a better introductory map.

There's nothing about an 18xx game that provides me any form of enjoyment, and so the prospect of spending another three hours(at minimum) per session at least half a dozen more times just to progress past the conscious incompetence stage is unappealing. The strategies and tactics of this genre will forever remain opaque to me.

Very enjoyable.  Played twice now, 2P and 4P.  Both were very well balanced.  The terrain is tight, and the tile mix is quite limited in some case (only 5, 8, 9 & 58 for the yellows, plus a special one for Copenhagen).  There are enough McGuffins in this one to choke a dead horse, I think.  Very interesting all around.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Small and fast 18xx, presumably best with three players but fine with four as well. It's comparable with 1889 in these concerns but it is not as friendly for beginners. The initial auction is far more decisive as the initial companies differ strongly in their potential and only five public companies are available in total, one of them only later through merging three minor companies into it. Play tends to be scripted as there are few different but no scarce tiles and the map has a lot of restrictions for builds. This will be nice for a few more plays to practice 'set pieces' but other 18xx's will be more interesting in the long run.

RATING: 8
Love the economic depth of 18xx. This is a great "shorter" version, with a very manageable amount of information on the board. Almost seems small enough to be scripted, but I think the interplay between the privates and minors and corporations makes for dynamic gameplay.

Tentative rating after two plays. Calculate 1 hour explaining time and a bit more than 4 hours playing time with newbies. Otherwise the playing time on the box seems realistic. However I have my doubts about this being a good introductory game though. There are just too many variables for people who do not know the 18XX system. 1851 seems better for introducing the game system, even though it plays longer.

I was surprised that a two-player 18xx game could be fun, but this was.  It took two experienced 18xx players much longer than three hours, but we were a little rusty on the system, so a lot of time looking at the rules.  I'm sure it will be quicker next time.  I liked this with two players, I think three would be the sweet spot for this one.

My copy from Deep Thought games has all the bells and whistles, although you can tell that it's handmade, that's a plus in this case - it is beautifully constructed.  I am very impressed by the games components.

Nice little 18xx. 3 minor and 5 major companies. The 3 minors are wholly owned and always pay half dividends, and get a once per game bonus run with +$80 if they are connected to their historical destination.
The minors merge to become one of the major companies (Swedish State) on the 5T. The charters get traded in for 10% shares.

The trains are double sided, you can pick e.g. a 3T or  2+2T, which is like a 2T that can also score 2 towns. The top trains are 5E which skips towns, and 4D which skips towns and doubles revenue.

Off board locations must be tokened to score. Dividends allow for no movement, single bump, double bump or backwards.

Playable in an evening provided you all know the rules.

Got in a trade for B&O July 2012

This was my first excursion into the 18xx series of games.  While I'm usually disinclined toward stock games, this one didn't feel like too much of one, as each player basically claimed one of the major companies and ran with it.  It seemed like the point of the game was to try to construct the idealized best route for your company, and then break the bank with it.  Kind of like Age of Steam with infinite cubes.  While I could appreciate the concept, this took a little too long for me, with not enough reward in the middle.

I don't expect to see this for at least another couple years. Either he's stopped producing games or hasn't updated his queue. Or both.

Interesting game. Unsure of how to rate this since we did play with players who only knew half the rules. Finnish was super strong and ended up blowing us away. Not sure if it's really that powerful or if we just played the game wrong. Interested to see how this plays with 2-3 players.

Noooooooooo! To clarify: while I understand that DH was aiming for an intro-18xx game I found the sacrifices in player options in this particular intro-18xx game resulted in a game that was less than interesting. Played once, won't play again.  I'm not sure a good intro-18xx game is a possibility - then again I'm not sure if I can properly review an intro-18xx game.  I (and I think most 18xx gamers) play 18xx games precisely because they are complex.

I have had a chance to play this several times now.  I pretty much like anything in this series.  This one is short enough that I have a reasonable chance of it hitting the table once in a while.

Edit 12-2009

When I first was learning, I thought of this as a three player game.  And, as a teaching game, it works well with three.  However, four players creates an unevenness that makes the game a lot more fun once you have learn the system.

Homemade copy.  The latest version of the rules is a definite improvement over the previous version, but some further clarifications would still be helpful. I remain unconvinced about game balance - something feels odd about it.  The game is still in beta though, so hopefully these things will get fixed before it is properly released.

The extremely limited tile mix can be frustrating at times, but I guess that helps to make this an introductory 18xx-game.  On cross-purpose with that, though, the game offers a veritable smörgåsbord of different style of special rules found in other 18xx games - mergers, destinations, private company special powers, off-board map hexes - I think 1825 is definitely to prefer as an introductory 18xx game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not sure why this is dubbed as a good introductory 18xx game, especially since players are expected to operate a minor company and a corporation from the get go.  While I understood the former to be kind of an abstract class of the latter, simplified by the absence of stocks, which would have made it a great teaching tool for a beginner.  However, you can't possibly be expected to do well without having ownership of a corporation as well, and having to switch gear constantly during each OR to manage two similar yet different things becomes overwhelming, even for those familiar with the system.

Then there was the state railroad which comes into play at phase 5.  A clever (but not sure if it's balanced) concept which will no doubt be another source of confusion, and only the most perceptive players would realize the need to set themselves up as the president just before it is made available to be floated.  An unfair advantage over newbies, especially since it starts with (at least) two of the most lucrative stations (one at Stockholm and the other right next to Copenhagen) and possibly a good amount of wealth gobbled from the minor companies.

I found the privates to be unintuitive, especially with the addition of the ferry and mine tokens.  Interesting mechanics, but nevertheless they were things that require even more bookkeeping which further complicated the game for the players.  The incredibly high amount of earning was also a source of concern (and with that how the CMV was moved according to its value versus the dividend), we had the SJ operating at 800K towards the end.  Wouldn't it have been better to just decrease the amount of the bank?

I'm by no means well versed in 18xx, but I think 18Scan is a far cry of an beginner title when compared to others like 18GA or 18AL.  I did not dislike my first play of it, but I can't say I'm very impressed either.  Unique concepts don't always make for an enjoyable game.

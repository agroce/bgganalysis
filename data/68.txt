RATING: 6
Don´t Own it. Played once at four players (2nd ed).
Multiplayer CDG themed in the post Alexander with players in the role of successors trying to rule their empires, overcome their rivals and gain hegemony .

Too chaotic for my taste. I do not like the wild diplomacy/trachery of this title.
Some battle cards are too powerful (treason/murder) that can destroy an entire army  putting the player out of the game for an entire turn :(
Most of the time events are of little use and there is no reason to spend ops.
An attempt to use the same system as the Hannibal RvsC at multiplayer level but fell short.
Too long (6-9 hours)
Nowadays are better and more enjoyable and balanced strategic multiplayer games.

RATING: N/A
Second addition rules made good clarifications, additions, and cleaned up a couple of items.  Combat system is simple, elegant and effective.  Combat does not bog the game down.  The game is steeped in theme - the cards add a good deal of flavor.  The game plays well and is fun.  The components are excellent.

RATING: 8
The second best game of card-driven multiplayer boardgames after "Sword of Rome". Absolutely high replay value due to the draw of the leaders at the beginning of the game. I am rating the AH version.

RATING: 10
The 4-page "Blood & Sand" basic game is a consistent crowd pleaser: why waste time bogged down with more detail when new players can ramp up and hold their own in less time than it takes to set up? Raucous power plays and fickle fortune keep everyone in-the-game and on the edge!

Okay, this is one of those heavily themed historical games that I'm a sucker for.  Lesson to newbies, never ever accidentally take the lead at the start of the game.  The second lesson is if the starting situation has you taking the lead at the start you know you're going to get a lot of heat thrown your way.

This is one of those games where it's the journey not the destination.  You've got to be willing to deal with those swings of fate, and using your negotiation powers to not become the target.  It's taken me several plays, but I feel like I'm starting to understand the game.

As game #68, just how long has Successors been listed on the Geek?  I ask this because as of today (27/11/05), there are a total of nine threads listed under "General Articles."  This game gets little attention on BGG, and garners even less respect, and yet it demands prices that redefine the word "dumb."

Before I begin my semi-rant, let me quote from the historian, F.E. Adcock, 

"My purpose is interpretation, and as interpretation must be, in part, subjective, so it must be, in part, hazardous. All I can do is to give you the picture that has formed itself in my mind, without asking you to accept it when your own judgment does not find it acceptable."  

As a game, this is every bit as good as Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage (perhaps even better?).  As an historical simulation . . . well . . . I don't know.  I've read diddly squat on this period of history, unlike the 2nd Punic War.  And naturally, when low and behold you leave a new thread asking your fellow Geeks what the best books are for this period of Ancient history . . . well . . . all you hear is the sound of cyber-silence.  It seems that many Geeks only have time to read game rules, or books have become terrible passé and no one bothered to inform me.  Or both.

Don't let the "Hannibal's better" crowd full you (and consider yourself lucky if you can play either of these games, and if you get to own them . . . well . . . truly you are blessed), and 
I almost gagged at the comment that "Successors is not quite as good as Sword of Rome."  Barf-oh-rama!  But let's take a slightly more serious (limited space & time are factors) look at a few comments:

1) "Obsolesced by Sword of Rome, I suspect."  How so?  Having played both, I think both games make a strong effort to reflect the unique gaming (and historical?) aspects of their particular ancient eras.  

2) "I'm just not a fan."  A 5.2 rating.  Not a fan of the game, but maybe a fan of decimal points, otherwise, how does one explain the ".2"?  For people who are considering selling their first-born male children in order to buy this game (or Hannibal), pithy comments like this one and the following--

3) "Very boring game"  and this

4) "Complicated game of "Daddy's Dead, Who's got the Body". Lot's of potential for backstabbing. Nice components." (and this from a 5.99999--I kid you not--rating)

make the decision all too clear(?).

5) "A card driven game that has little or no originality or intensity to it, poorly implemented chrome but it's multiplayer so all isn't bad."  So, just how many card-driven wargames (or do we technically have to go back to the 2nd edition rules where the Tyche cards allow you to move/train armies, etc.?) were on the market when Successors came out in 1997?  How does it display no originality?  And as far as no intensity, perhaps it is time to check for a pulse.

6) "Excellent concept and components marred by clunky gameplay. Goes on far too long. Big luck factor in initial draw of factions. Lots of annoying, unique rules. Don't be fooled into thinking it's anywhere close to the game Hannibal is."  Big luck factor in initial draw of factions--well, duh!  You are talking about dealing out cards.  And gosh golly, don't you just hate those annoying, uniuque rules, you know, the kind of rules that make a game . . . well . . . unique from other same-so games in a different kind of way.  Why can't we, and the games we play, all be alike?  And no, don't be fooled about Successors and Hannibal both being great games.  No, we wouldn't want that to happen to you foolish, foolish people.

7) "Took away the best part of Hannibal, the combo of Strategy cards and Battle Cards. Just rolling dice for combat is a bit boring."  Well, I'm not a big fan of just rolling the dice, but in Successors, at least both sides get to roll, and the weaker side does have a chance (how great must be left to the number crunchers to decide) for an upset.  But to call the battle cards one of the best parts of Hannibal?  It is too laugh, or at least it would be if it wasn't so sad a thought. 

8) "I sold it. I love Hannibal but this isn't nearly as neatly integrated: using cards for political control becomes worthless partway through the game. Many good ideas - including the multiple paths to victory. But it is chaotic and brutal - lose one big battle and you are pretty much out of it. Too little constraint on the politicking for my taste. Second edition rules help a bit but not enough."  

To each his own.  For my part, I find the game to be tightly integrated.  I suppose it comes down to how we define "integrated" when speaking of a card-driven wargame.  The 2nd edition rules (thankfully) took care of the problem of the cards becoming worthless for political control.  It is "chaotic and brutal," and there may be "too little constraint on the politicking."  The reading I have done to date supports the chaotic nature of the game, Things will be chaotic and brutal, with little restraint.  Welcome to history, ancient civil war history, that is. 

Perhaps the most important "thing" that Hannibal and Successors have in common is the name of Mark Simonitch.  And don't you think he knew what he was doing when he helped to develop Successors and then write the 2nd edition rules?  

More to follow . . . .

RATING: 7
This game is worth to be tried, if you re not scared by wargames. It's a well realised struggle for Alexander inheritance. It's different from Sword of Rome. SoR has each nation with a different doctrine and capability, but a strategy that is usually set by geographic position. Successors has variable starting position for otherwise quite similar factions. The strategy then is different each game, and be a blend between mere brute and powerful expansion or a subtle collection of legitimacy. If played with skilled opponents it's a real gem 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Decent wargame covering the breakup of Alexander's Empire. Utilizes card-driven and point-to-point movement mechanics made popular with games like We the People. Can be long due to the scale and even more so when players prone to analysis-paralysis are involved.

The new 2nd Ed rules punched this game up to a '9' for me. Very cool game but a bit on the complex side, given the fact that there is a big chaos element - although the complexity buys a lot of wonderful historical flavor. While on the same order of complexity as Hannibal by most of the usual metrics, somehow Successors feels more complex, perhaps just because being a 4-player game it's harder to get a game together (which leads to longer breaks, which leads to lack of retention ...). Anyway, get the play time down to 3.5-4.5 hours and this is a first-rate game; more than that, and it's probably not worth it, although expect the first game or two to run long as players get the hang of it. Will appeal to grognards who don't mind the complexity overhead. Recent release of The Napoleonic Wars has reminded me of just how good Successors is; TNW is a similar game, nominally simpler but far less clean.

Its a little on the long side...but if you can get 4 dedicated players and are looking for something rich in theme, this is a great choice.

The common elements to Hannibal are very obvious, but the game plays much differently. Successors seems to flow much better than Sword of Rome (for another 4p CDG). 

The drawback to these types of games for me is the introduction of a metagame negotiation element. Here, it seems to work out particularly favorably since the Usurper is designated by the game itself each turn....and the leader is reeled in a bit without the feeling that everyone is intentionally trying to club you on the head.

Finally, the multiple paths to victory add a great flavor.

Decent multi-player wargame using a card driven system.  The first edition, however, didn't get the development and play-testing it needed (and I don't generally want to pay for second editions unless I REALLY like the game).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fantastic theme, rich in historical detail. Handles the get the leader syndrome well - if you win a battle, your army takes minimal casualties wheras the losers suffer heavily. You can therefore shatter a coalition against you without succumbing to attrition. This is historically accurate as the majority of casualties were suffered during the rout in this period. It's much more than a 1-dimensional build up the biggest army game though, -you couldn't possibly hold enough territory to win that way- although you might be able to get Alexanders body back to Pella for a legitimacy (political win) - 

Look it has the silver shields, war elephants, naval battles and 23,000 independant greek colonists fighting their way from Asia...what more do you want?

This is basically a four player version of Hannibal with a little bit of Kingmaker tossed in. I enjoy the time period, I like the unified theme and the multiple paths to victory make it more than just a conquer the world game. Compare that with Sword of Rome, where everyone is more or less doing their own thing. Also, this game has a reasonably good 3 player variant, unlike Sword of Rome.

How is it that the oldest card-driven titles are often the best? 
 
Simonitch and Berg, two of the longest-lived names in the industry, crafted this gem long ago and it somehow remains under the radar. It is not at all balanced or elegant, yet it is an eventful roller-coaster ride of a game. The definative mutli-player game for the card-driven type.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
  A hidden classic, and, in my experience, a hugely underrated game that gains depth with repeated play.  The best element of the game is it&#039;s balance: however down you may be at the end of a turn, you can start over in the following turn and take the lead.  Even with what looks like a weak position at the outset, you can find yourself on top in the end.
  I definitely recommend this game strongly to fans of the card-driven games, but it does have the drawback of requiring four reasonably evenly matched players to reach it&#039;s full enjoyment potential.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Solid 4 player war game. You get 2 random generals at the start and their territories. This gives the game alot of freshness and replay value. It has two routes to victory, so plenty of trade offs to be had, lots of historical flavor. It can be rather swingy and you can loose a character to a single card play or poor roll in a battle, and this can be fairly devastating. But war is random and history isn't fair. I dont think the rules are that complex, some bits are a bit detailed a fiddly. There's five turns and your typically looking at 45-60mins per turn with 4 players so it could be a 5 hour game if it goes the distance.

Multi-player wargame about the wars of the Successors of Alexander the Great.

After playing Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, this game was a bit of a disappointment. The rules were considerably more fiddly (without making it a better simulation), and the gameplay was much more chaotic. Still, compared to some of the card-driven game designs we've seen later, this one isn't too bad! The second edition rules also makes this more accessible.

Chaotic, multi-player wargame.  Although there is a random start-up and mechanics that both allow the rich to get richer through the reinforcement rules, there is also a built-in beat up on the leader mechanic as well.

The game captures the theme very well, and after 1 or 2 turns, you're fighting the other players, not the rules.  I prefer it to Wellington and Napoleonic Wars, the other multi-player card driven games I've played.

AH's attempt to create multi-player Hannibal. I like this game a lot with the second edition rules. Multiple paths to victory (legitimacy or victory points or legitimacy plus victory points depending on how and when the game ends) and variable game length (the player controlling Alexander's heirs on turns 3 and 4 can decide to end the game or execute the heir and keep playing) keeps players on their toes.

This is a pretty good card assisted war game.  It's really what I would call an experience game ... if you don't take it too seriously you can have a good time.  It's rich with theme, there's some luck involved and you're going to be sitting around the table for 5 hours.  Battles can be very expensive so choose them wisely and make sure you account for the cards your opponents may be carrying since some of them can be devastating.  The rulebook is a beast but once you learn the system it's fairly straight-foward.

Outstanding, yet underrated, multi-player game (2nd edition) that plays differently each time.  Players randomly choose their generals before the game.  Each general has different strengths and weaknesses as indicated by their initiative rating, combat rating, and personal "prestige" (if any).  Players use only one deck of cards that can be used a variety of ways.  There are several paths to victory and lots of agonizing decisions to make since you can't do everything you'd like.  The geography is more expansive than Sword of Rome, so there is more room for maneuver.  I love how the system integrates both warfare and political intrigue.  Works well with three or four players.

The best multi-player wargame I have played.  Each turn presents the players with new goals and provides the variety necessary to keep a 5 hour game tense and fresh.  Each card play requires careful consideration and involves difficult decisions.  The only failing is the ability of a player to bury Alexander at the beginning of turn 2.  Although this is a logical move, this breaks the script for turn 2 and makes it no different than turn 1 (a minor quibble).

I have yet to play this game, but where am I going to find another 3 players who are willing to devote their time?

RATING: 6.5
Never understood why Hannibal is rated so highly and this one is almost ignored. Battlecards replaced by simple die rolls, which is less fun but probably speeds up play. The fact that it is multiplayer rather than 2 player is probably the major drawback.

A truly beautiful game.  One of Avalon Hill's "last hurrahs."  An actual game board and wonderful graphics to boot!  Plays very well on an interesting historical period.

Fabulous four-player card-driven wargame.  Incredibly tense, not much downtime.

This was a follow up to Hannibal with players taking change of two random successors after Alexander's death. The only time I saw this 3-4 player game work was with 5 players at a convention, and I never quite understood its popularity. I sold off my copy for £20 at a B&B stall not realising that copies were exchanging hands for £60 each on the internet, I almost caused a riot amongst the buyers.

I played this once. It was fun enough, but it's way too long for me to suggest playing again. Let me put it this way, if you think you'll like this game, you probably will.

Gave my copy to Resin in GQNSSS 2011.

Very fiddly and not enough action. Players are loathe to engage in combat because of the disastrous results of a combat loss.

A Euro with wargame rules; that's not a good thing. Played a trial partial game (2nd ed. rules)and felt that combat was too unforgiving (in addition to painful rules). Too long unless experience (if one is patient enough to acquire it) reduces playing to 2 1/2 hours. Possibly could go up in rating.

...battles are decisive...and are fought by simple dice system....you can calculate your certain victory..(general might die..but general must lead)....5 hours and enthuastic players of that period..

I sold it.  I love Hannibal but this isn&#039;t nearly as neatly integrated: using cards for political control becomes worthless partway through the game.  Many good ideas - including the multiple paths to victory.  But it is chaotic and brutal - lose one big battle and you are pretty much out of it.  Too little constraint on the politicking for my taste.  Second edition rules help a bit but not enough.

Excellent concept and components marred by clunky gameplay. Goes on far too long. Big luck factor in initial draw of factions. Lots of annoying, unique rules.

Played for first time yesterday. Very interesting game, but rather slow, and a bit clunky. May move more smoothly once know rules better, and I will probably give it a higher rating then.

Great multi-player card-driven wargame on my favorite historical period. Alexander the Great is dead and his empire is up for grabs. The random factions and multiple paths to victory make every game different.

Who doesn't like a wargame where the best move is to wait for others to get impatient and attack you in your defensive position out of frustration?  The cards are so much more worthwhile than anything you do with your generals that it is best to carve out some easy land in the beginning and wait for good cards to come around.  Otherwise, if you lose your army you are out of the running for a good turn or two.  Nothing like blowing a roll and then having nothing to do for and hour and a half until you restock.  Even then you are only at a marginal power.

The game is filled with fun chrome, but the play is dated and obsolete.  I feel that Antike scratches the itch that this sucker tried to do in its antiquated way.  I much prefer the combat system for We the People / Hannibal over the CRT.

A shame, as there are a number of great thematic events.  Too bad the game is so dreadfully boring that it can't keep the truly intriguing stuff worthwhile. Just bury the damn body right away it isn't worth moving.

Slow.  Plodding.

Way too much work for an overly complex "take that" card game.

Tacticon Aug 2007: played first edition.  Much more fiddily than Hannibal.  Fun, but needs to be more streamlined.  I won, but not sure how much of that was luck.

RATING: 8
Second edition rules made good clarifications, additions, and cleaned up a couple of items.  Combat system is simple, eloquent and effective.  Combat does not bog the game down.  The game is steeped in theme - the cards add a good deal of flavor.  The game plays well and is fun.  The components are of excellent quality.

Variable starting positions give much replayability, limited playing time of maybe 3 to 6 hours, wonderful historical flavour. And most important: a multiplayer wargame which encourages action!
Very unelegant combat resolution.

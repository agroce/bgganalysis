The game is largely tactical and can provide some interesting decisions but the ‘twist’ doesn’t really provide enough to differentiate it enough from other games in the pick up and deliver market. Plus the map and pieces are pretty dull and don’t really make it too easy to see what belongs where.

A pick up and deliver game in which the network you travel over is constantly morphing.  While there are superficial similarities to Ticket to Ride (Marklin - we are shifting passengers around) in the playing of cards to place segments of track, Spectral Rails is really quite original.  Whereas TtR is about building networks, Spectral Rails is as much about dismantling ethereal track connections before others can use them. A clever rule allows you to travel along opponents' track, but to use your own only once.  

Production quality is pretty decent.  The artwork is OK, though the player colours on cards and train mats are harder than they ought to be to distinguish.  The rules are less than great, both in organization and in comprehensiveness.

Excellent game that has the potential to play quickly. Open information game with no random elements (other than initial soul tile placement when setting up for Rd1 and Rd2). This had a very different feel from other rail games because all of the track is built and you are essentially leaving a trail behind your train. To a certain extent it is desirable to have other competing trains in your neighborhood, since you can ride their rails for free. Removing ether trail segments is a subtle mechanism that creates uncertainty and allows for aggressive play. I suspect with more plays I will get better at reading the board and paying attention to what cards my opponents have played (and thus what remains in their hand). I am interested in exploring this game further.

A somewhat surprising game for me. It played quickly and was a good amount of fun for what it was. I wish there was a little more theme there, but overall it was an enjoyable experience. There are definitely some unique mechanisms in this one given how you lay rails and your hand of cards work by not being able to go over 13. I'd be happy to play it again some time.

This was worth the wait! Great game. We make up stories for the train wrecks. Everything from massive passenger death that also caused multicar pile-up including a tanker carrying poisonous gas that spead over a several mile area to a simple derailment who's only casualty was a splinter on one of the clean-up crew that became infected, causing a limb amputation that made his girlfriend leave him which lead, eventually, to suicide. Yes, we can be sick.

This is a clean game that seems to be well-balanced (I've played it only once.)  The rules take a little longer to explain than one would like for a game of this length, but once you start the game it moves pretty smoothly.

Despite this, I wasn't taken with this game; it's not in my sweet spot.  It certainly has elements of long-term planning, but the tactical focus was more than I like in a game.

It's ok. Interesting mechanic (use enemy rails for free, and never your own). The cards are awkward. The pick-up and drop-off mechanics are annoying - I could house-rule it to make it less so, but don't feel like playtesting the changes.

The game technically has no hidden information (you can count the cards, if you're so inclined), but other players can still greatly aid or impede your progress. The problem is that it's very hard to do either one *intentionally*. Ability to remove track makes the game much worse than it could have been, imho. I'd rather go play some Kingdom Builder, and let this find a new home.

This is a great example of a game that was completely killed by the decadence and transfer of ownership of Z-Man. There was quite a bit of enthusiasm surrounding the game that died down as the delays came. By the time the release finally came, it seemed like everyone had forgotten and now it's been dumped in the bargain bins.

There are some really interesting ideas and mechanisms, the ether tracks that can't be crossed make it feel unique for a train game. I would like to try this again, since slow play definitely dampened the fun and I would probably enjoy this more if it was a 45 - 60 minute game.

Played at Prezcon '06 at the Cafe Games booth. High quality, well tested design from this young new designer. I look forward to buying my copy when it's finally released. You owe it to yourself to try this game. It's a pick up and deliver game at it's core, with a smattering of logistics and set collection thrown in. Add a few twists I've never seen in any other game, and you've got a winner. Expect to hear ALOT about this game.

Update: 

Years later its finally released, we finally play more, and remember why we liked it so much. This remains an 8,

Bought this on a whim due to it always being on clearance. I enjoy pickup-and-deliver games, and train games in general, so I couldn't escape the thought that just maybe, this was a hidden gem. Having finally played it (after sitting on my shelf for a couple years), I can say that it's an okay game, and perhaps deserving of a bit more love than it tends to receive, but I'd stop short of calling it a diamond in the rough.

The ether trails mechanic feels somewhat novel, and there's enough game there to make it worth a second play, but I have serious doubts that this is a game that would stand up well to repeated plays. There's just not a lot of meat on the bones here. It sort of reminds me of Black Gold in that respect, although that comparison undoubtedly entered my mind due to the thematic similarity. Nonetheless, I think it's an apt comparison, in terms of the feel I get playing either of those games. In both games, it seems like there should be more going on than there actually is, but there's just not.

The novelty of the ether trail mechanic doesn't rise above mere novelty, and the game ends up being a fairly dry pick up and deliver game with not a whole lot of tension. You can count on your opponents doing their best to block you from using their ether trails, and you just calculate that into your planned moves. Meanwhile, the bidding for spirit leader is mostly a waste of time and has little overall effect on the game. As with Black Gold, the game somehow manages to be less than the sum of its parts. All the mechanics are there, but nothing really matters a whole lot, which results in a real lack of tension and tough decisions. On top of that, there's a lot of downtime, because you can't really plan your next turn until you see what the other players have done. Which ether segments they picked up, which passengers they picked up, whether they moved the game clock up by triggering a train wreck, etc.

I'd like to play this again just to make sure we didn't miss something the first time around, but I suspect we didn't, in which case this game will be (eventually) headed for the trade pile.

A very interesting twist of a railway network pick up & deliver game where you can only use your track once! The interaction level is very high as you need to make the most of other player's track before they dig it up to re-build it elsewhere and leave you stranded!
Fast paced and well though out.
RECOMMENDED.

I finally found this one and it usually sells for very cheap.
This is a really interesting game of delivering lost souls to their home towns.
As you build your track it leaves a vapor trail and this trail may be traveled on and used for free by your opponents, but you can never use your own vapor trail.
Very simple to play, but with good strategy.
Fun October game for sure.

RATING: 7
A pick up and deliver game with some mind-twisting stuff. Movement is really cheap if you follow other people around, but you'll be second to pick up and get leftover, non-easily-delivered stuff. If you go out on your own, movement is expensive but you get first pick at the more easily delivered stuff. Which makes it a hard game to understand how to play well and how to position yourself to take advantage of the other players' moves, and it deserves some replay for that alone. There's some analysis required at the beginning to determine decently efficient routes, but it flows alright after that. The rules aren't great - repeating stuff out of sequence, and forcing you to deduce if some move options are legal which could have been spelled out and clarified. But now the learning curve is over, it'll get some play as it comes in at a nice timeframe and generates some interesting post-game analysis.

I am not sure if we played this right but I found this game a bit too chaotic and all-over-the-place. The theme is interesting but I did not like it.

Pickup & deliver, with a bit of set collecting for bonus points, but done with panache.

Pick up and deliver railway game with a couple of original ideas. The aim is to transport souls on a ghost train to their hometowns across American south-western states. Points are accumulated when souls are delivered, and additional points are gained by having sets of souls from all three towns within a state and for having a soul from all states within the game. Where the game differs from others in this well-worn mechanism is that instead of laying track to run your train on, you instead leave a trail which you cannot move along but your opponents can. Planning moves therefore requires considering how not to hamper yourself on future turns whilst also ensuring that you’re not aiding your opponents to much either. This is a solid enough game of its sort but the originalities don’t do enough to make it particularly memorable and there are better pick up and deliver games out there i.e. the ‘Age of Steam’ family of games.

Sisteray's game. Pick-up-and-deliver where your train leaves behind a trail of Catan sticks that block you from immediately reusing the same trail; also, other players' Catan sticks are [i]free[/i] for you to travel over, so that the travel plans of other players are important.

I like how the game plays but I'm not sure I have it in me to be any good at it. After the randomized setup, there is no luck or hidden information, except that halfway through the game some more tiles are distributed. I don't seem to feel as much control as I would expect. In theory I guess I should be able to think through not just my best path but also everybody else's best path, and if I fail to do this then a loss is my own fault. It's pretty hard though.

Despite that, it's pretty forgiving. It rarely feels like if you miscalculate your move, you risk completely throwing it away (as in a game like Neuland).

The game's clock is strange. Each half of the game ends when the third of three special cities is visited. So the players have great influence on how quickly the game will finish. What is strange to me is that in the first half of the game you may well have no idea how advancing the clock affects relative player standings, though it surely does have a great effect on the outcome, and these triggers have to be pulled at some point.

Scoring is on quantity of deliveries, timing of deliveries (in that first-half pickups delivered in the second half are worth double for some reason), delivering to every city in a state, and delivering something in all states. Penalties for the game ending with passengers still on your train.

I like the game, especially in theory: It was initially amazing for me to realize that it wasn't the whole story to chart a course matching supplies to demands, and that one would also want to consider where other players will be building so that you can leech off their tracks.

One thing really sets this game apart.  You can dissipate the spectral rail lines placed on a previous turn and screw up other player's plans in the process.  How cool is that?

Like many good train games, you are delivering cubes around the board (actually chits in this case).  Each chit is a soul, and must be picked up and carried to its desired destination.  This immediately makes it better than TTR and almost every other train game that is in the 45-60 min play range.

On top of this, you get a really creative and wonderful theme, a few innovative ideas (ie rails are only laid after you move over them), solid strategy, and great player interaction.  This is truly a great rails game.

To quote from the rules:

[i]"Spectral rails is played in two rounds. Each round consists of multiple Sequences. Sequences are played with three phases, and each phase is played in turns..."[/i]

From that excerpt, you should be able to surmise that the rulebook from [i]Spectral Rails[/i] is despairingly bad.  A detailed example of a full Sequence would have been a boon, for instance. To save you the work of scanning the forums, important rules that are either difficult to understand or impossible to find can be found [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1072363/list-of-rules-clarifications]here[/url].

As far as the game itself, it's brainy fun if you can overcome the dark, distracting board art.  The theme is cool, and there are some neat mechanics. Unsurprisingly, as with any pick-up-and-deliver game, players are rewarded for advance planning - which means that the listed 60 minute play time is dangerously inaccurate.  [i]Spectral Rails[/i] is easily a 90-120 minute game with four thinky players.

Since all information is completely open, games might take even longer if players maximize their chances of winning by (a) picking up track that disrupts other players' deliveries and (b) planning their train movements to pick up soul tiles that break up other players' sets.  Either of these strategies require players to think deeply about the board and player mats for extended periods, hence the added game length.

[i]Warning[/i]:  In  mid-game, a player can get hosed (through no fault of their own) if no one builds near that player, since the isolated player will be forced to pay fully for each build and will quickly run out of movement cards.  Also, the second half of the game can end quickly if players beeline for the train wreck markers.  That's a bit wonky.  (The first half can end abruptly as well, but typically no one is motivated to end the first half quickly.)

[i]Update[/i]:

Rating keeps going up.

Consistently, new players comment on the game's uniqueness and clever design.  Even better, our time-related worries are now soundly behind us, as we've had more games hit the 90-minute mark than the 120-minute mark - primarily because we don't micro-scrutinize the board and each other's train mats.

Hey, I like it!

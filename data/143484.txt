I enjoy this game a lot.  It's essentially a worker placement with cards, and it also has a touch of engine building.

RATING: 7
A card game emulating worker placement mechanics, like it a lot in the beginning, but the random factor which influences heavily the final outcome was a bit of a turn off. Liked the game overall, but I would definitely house rule a few things the next time I play it.

Very good game. In response to those saying the purple cards are overpowered, I don't think that is true in practice. The rules specifically mention that they are balanced, and after (a very few) plays, I would have to agree.  All our games have been very close, even using completely different strategies (and with different availability of extra turns).

A nice and short development game with great graphic design (excellent resource cards). I would classify it with mundus novus that came out almost in the same time. The game seems balanced and fair.

Just recently started playing Florenza: The Card Game. I have not played Florenza, so I can't compare it. Anyway, I find the game to be quite fun. Not bad with two but better with more, as the battle for resources, etc. is tighter. I like how it requires you to think a few turns ahead as you build up your resources for whatever you plan to build. Sort of a slow burn. I think the art really matches the theme of the game. It's not easy to find as Miniature Market and Cool Stuff do not seem to have it listed.

A very fun, meaty card-game Euro that feels like a bigger game (and takes up quite a big space on the table). It's much better than the Florenza board game, for a number of reasons: 

1)  It doesn't require nearly as much budgeting/counting/planning from turn to turn, since you discard your hand after every round. 

2) Resource generation is much easier, since you don't need to build resource buildings and you don't have a limited number of workers to do things. 

3) It's smaller, so you can travel with it (although this would have been made much easier if the box weren't so big).

Need an improvement about the cards colour for a better game understanding (brown and yellow are too similar... green, blue and gray cards may have a single colour with some simbol for the combination... in this way 1 of 2 left colour may be used instead brown)

Solid resource conversion card Euro. Gets fiddly towards the end since you hold lots of cards. Whoever says that the cards that give extra actions are overpowered and thus the game is luck-driven, has not played the game enough, as guilds and resource generating cards balance those. The game is well-balanced, thus my above average rating.

Much prefer its older brother with its tiles and take that aspect though so wIll trade away.

RATING: 7
That I'm giving this a relatively high rating speaks volumes about how much I enjoy certain parts of the game, given that I absolutely despised the randomness of the extra action cards.  Getting a few extra actions in the game can be enormous, especially if that comes with extra cards and money.  But if you don't manage to draw the house or preacher cards early (or worse, continue to draw ones you've already built), then you just get hosed.  I'd much rather have seen a pile of them that anyone can build from, and remove that particular luck element.  Or better, since everyone would then spend the early game building them (probably), just get rid of them and let the game be fine other parts.

TRADED IT! (For City Tycoon)

The game works and has all the trappings of a classic "resource to victory points in a small number of turns" Euro. The problem is other games do it way better without the fussy pile of cards all over and needless upkeep of dealing out card rows and managing draw piles. It also suffers from the fact there is little tension, as most goals produce roughly the same points. Another issue is with so few actions each turn, one never uses half of the available choices (ie. who bothers to sell a good for money when you have plenty to make your one building a round).

Don't get me wrong, 15 years ago when the competition was low, this would of been a passable game to play. but in today's market it is wholly forgettable.

A good game with heaps of variability, and several alternative strategies.  Printed words are also quite difficult to read, someone thought they would look prettier if they were more squiggley, but they don't. 

Some colours of the cards are quite misleading, the yellow looks very much like the brown.  It's the main downside.  

Plays well with 4 - not tries with more.

RATING: 5
On one hand Florenza is a fairly meaty economic development and engine building game, on the other it's a highly luck-driven card game. Those two qualities are obviously very much at odds with each other, and the strategic character of city development never really materializes because you are typically reduced to playing the exact hand you get dealt each turn. The way the extra actions are handled and the missing lookahead from turn to turn strongly tilt the game balance towards the lucky draw.

Well-designed card game, more complex than many boardgames, but presumably less complex than the original.  Sort of a cross between Princes of Florence and Bruges in terms of doing good works with artists, and playing cards to your tableau to improve your points engine.  Nothing super new, but plays well.  Card colours not differentiated enough for the Guild cards.

RATING: 2.5
Mediocre game with an economic engine seen a hundred times before. Get resources and build things that either get you more ressources or victory points. This alone would not result in my bad rating but the game has a major flaw:
You start with 4 actions per round. The purple cards will allow you to boost this up to 8 actions per round (in a 5 round game). In our 4 player game we had two players going up to six actions right in round one to then boost it up to 7 actions in the second round. For this you just need to be lucky enough to get them drawn. Other players did not see any purple card in the hole game and therefore stayed with their 4 actions.
You don't have to be a prof. in math to understand that with 7 actions over several rounds you get a lot more done than with only 4 actions. Completely inbalanced game due to this flaw.

RATING: 8
The boardgame was fine, but too complex for my taste. 
Thus I am very happy with this variant, which can be played in an hour, and has several paths to victory.
it is an uncomplicated, yet interesting game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Too random, though you might not notice it for a few plays. The cards that give extra actions are so much better than the others, even better than income cards, because you can use extra action for income or for something else. Yet you might never see any of them. Mixing deck eras together before dealing is exactly backwards too -- try getting nothing but era I cards when the opponents are getting era III cards, but it's quite possible. Anyway, these things lead to rich get richer problems.

This game is a good example of how players will tolerate levels of randomness from a deck of cards that they would never permit in a dice game.

I really wanted to like this game. Even though the theme is completely generic, I always wanted to try Florenza, but its price and complexity I found too daunting. I was hoping that the card game would be more accessible. But it felt weird, very sprawling and clunky. Like you can take all kinds of cards and make them work together. There were so many cards that it became fruitless to even look at what your opponent was doing, which in a 2-player game like I tried, must be a bad thing. It felt too open-ended, more like building with Legos rather than playing a game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It's a bit odd. This game feels very solitair despite you being so reliant on what the other players do. Probably due to the importance of those hand cards that you're sneakily striving towards. Also, might make it more interactive if you play with open resources (so you know who might be aiming for what monuments).
Scores are surprisingly closes usually which is not really a good thing here. Due to the way how artist cards work this means many a game can be determined by the luck of your (artist) draw.

The first impression I got is a bit ho-hum Euro with nothing new or novel, but I feel it might improve once I play with the guilds and get a little better general feel of it.

Haven't played the boardgame version ever so I can't compare these two. The cardgame version is well made, although far from being excellent or unique: we've seen these kind of games a lot. The game takes a lot of space, but because of the clear symbols used it is easy to see everything you need. The game is missing more competition - now it's more like 'oh, you took that action/card, now I need to get into "goal" using other actions/routes'. In the end the biggest issue is that Florenza is too long compared what it offers. This and the fact, that the game feels similar to many-many other games is a combo, that 6 is enough. The game goes to category "sure I play it again, but would choose many games instead of it".

RATING: 6
Dropped my rating after a couple plays from 7 -> 6. It is a fine game, but not one that is a keeper for my collection. Just not quite enough going on and the setup can be a pain.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

This is a solid card game version of the boardgame...:-)  Maintains a very similar feel as you construct works of art and hire an artist to complete said work of art.  However, the card game plays in 60-90 minutes whereas the boardgame can take almost 4 hours!  Setup can take a bit of time as one lays out the cards, but the game flow is fairly straightforward as the 8 action choices are fairly simple.

Major disappointment. Florenza is my most beloved worker placement, and this card-game adaptation distills down till it's nothing special. All the interesting points in Florenza BG (the player with most points would be the first player, the 'bishop points', earn points by building workshops others in need...) are all gone, and the interaction is few and very indirect. I'm sure someone would love this game better than the BG version, likely because of the shorter game-time, less likely to suffer from resource constraint and less direct 'cutthroat' interaction, it's just not my taste.
Edited after playing second time on 17/5/2014: The game is definitely much less brutal than the original Florenza, as in the BG version you need to constantly watch other players' plan and modify yours accordingly. In the cardgame this only happens in the last 2 turns (if not only in the last turn) which makes the finale meaty but the beginning quite stale in comparison. As mentioned before, some players who did not enjoy competition would enjoy the cardgame better. Rating up from 6.5 to 7.

Sehr gelungene Umsetzung des deutlich längeren Brettspiels. Vor allem wurde das Hauptproblem des Brettspiels, der Startspieler-Vorteil, hier elegant umschifft. 
Das Spiel-Gefühl ist ähnlich wie bei Florenza, aber durch die deutlich gestrafft Spieldauer, wirkt es beim Kartenspiel noch intensiver und höher konzentriert. Das Material ist sehr ordentlich und die Downtime ist angenehm kurz.

Allerdings kann es zu Ungleichgewichten kommen, wenn die Lila Gebäude und Adligen, die zusätzliche Aktionen erlauben, in der ersten Runde sehr ungünstig verteilt werden.

Insgesamt aber ein prima Spiel mit sehr gutem Spieltiefe zu Spielzeit Verhältnis!

In this game you collect materials by selecting resources/actions etc. from a central tableau in order to complete buildings to score victory points. The game works extremely well but 5 rounds of play makes the game feel just a little bit too long as you are doing the same thing each round.
A second play has confirmed that it is just too long and boring for me.

One of the four EuropeMasters games 2014. Unfortunately after EuropeMasters you are fed up with the games. 

This game got a lot of complaints both when practising before the tournament and during. Most were about it being to random; what cards you are dealt decides your chances, and whether you get many masterpieces or not makes a big difference. I don't really agree with the first, the cards you are dealt limits your strategical options, but you can still make good with most hands. I agree that masterpieces can be kingmakers, but this is a fairly short game and randomness is ok. 

I hope to play this again with the expansion.

I didn't know much about this game, or the game it is based on, but I had seen a few pictures of the components and was intrigued.

Each round you get cards and a handful of actions, and possibly more depending on what you've built. The game is about gathering resources to build either cards from your hand, or a communal pool of monuments. Additionally, building most buildings requires hiring one of the artists/architects that come out every turn (which have semi-hidden variable victory points). Many of the buildings have abilities that feed into helping you build other things. Each action spot in the game can only be used once per turn, so there's a mad dash to get the stuff you want/need.

There's a few other ways to get points... most money at the end, most cards at the end (maybe?), sets of colored buildings (blue, green, gray), being start player, etc.

The game is quick but interesting. Like many card games of this type, there's a bit of luck in card draw, but that's the challenge I enjoy about these games, making due as best you can with what you're given. And the game length means that a run of bad card draws isn't so bad. If this was a longer game that might bother me, but the amount of randomness feels appropriate for the length.

At first I was worried, as during setup the cards take over your table.  I was worried that my wife wouldn't like it, although with theme and the game play that turned out to not be true.  After our first play through, she actually requested that we play again several times.  There are many ways to get renown, but in the end that is the only thing that matters to win.  You have to figure out your own strategy as to how you will manage your money, resources, and the cards in your hand to gain points.  Fun game with many strategies.

  I do wish there had been an insert in the box to hold the hundreds of cards, instead of zip-lock bags.  Also, the "capitano del popolo" marker and card system - hard to get it to stay in place.

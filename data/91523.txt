Awesome!  Galaxy Trucker without the destruction.  Not a big enough of a fan to also pick the game up, but if my GF (who hates the GT destruction) likes this game, maybe I'll pick it up....

I've decided not to pick it up since its not different enough from GT and I'm definitely going to pick up Wok Star.  That said, I like the game even more after realizing we had made a couple rules errors in our initial plays.

Galaxy Trucker without the tiresome, mechanistic second half of every turn.  But also shorn of its jolly space ship construction/destruction theme.  Instead, we are terraforming islands and populating them with animals (good) and volcanoes (bad).  Ho-hum.

As someone who doesn't enjoy puzzles and is hopeless at doing them under time pressure,  I found the quicker, more streamlined Mondo less enervating than Galaxy Trucker.  I'd play it again; I'd veto Galaxy Trucker. 

Production quality of the tiles and boards is just fine, though the artwork is very bland.  The rules are perfectly clear.

Average family game. Players are using tiles in order to create their own little world. There is a time limit so you should be as fast as you can. Afterwards we score Victory Points based of some categories like how many animals live in each world. There are also negative points for mistakes like connecting a desert tile with a forest tile. Good quality components.
The game is too easy and I dont think that it has enough replayability.

\_______GER_______/
Das Spiel ähnelt der Aufbauphase von Galaxy Trucker (auch wenn das Thema deutlich weniger im Weltraum als eher auf der Erde angesiedelt ist).
Man muss sich auf den Zeitdruck durch die Eieruhr einlassen (7 Minuten können ganz schön kurz sein). Beim ersten Mal sammelt man eigentlich mehr oder weniger chaotisch und ist dann bei der Punkteabrechnung doch sehr enttäuscht über das maue Ergebnis. Aber beim weiteren Spielen erkennt man die Symbole schon etwas besser und kann daher auch besser die guten von den weniger guten Karten unterscheiden und aussuchen (trotzdem sind 7 Minuten immer noch sehr kurz).
Das Kartenlegen hat auch durchaus Ähnlichkeit zu Carcassone, zumindest was das Erstellen von geschlossenen Gebieten angeht.
Bei häufigeren Spielen würde sich sicherlich eine gewisse Routine einstellen die Vielspielern einen klaren Vorteil vor Erst- oder Wenigspielern geben würde. Erst nach einigen Spielen eröffnen sich wohl die komplexeren Möglichkeiten hohe Punktresultate zu bekommen.
Insgesamt ein nettes Spiel.

For fans of puzzle play, this could be a fun addition.  The base game is a tad too easy for gamers.  The additional twists of the game add some nice angles to the otherwise straight forward play.  The key to the game's challenge is really just time.  Want the game to be devilishly hard?  crank the time down to just a few minutes.  There's a trade-off with this though.  As the time vanishes, the luck factor ratchets up.  So you kind of need to find your sweet spot for the game to feel great.  Overall, a nice game, but nothing stellar.

RATING: 4
10/24: This is the first half of Galaxy Trucker where you're solving a puzzle by using various tiles to build your world.  The tiles are two sided, one side will have multiple terrains while the other side is solid.  There are various bonuses such as animals that you obtain to gain extra point.  

I'm not certain why this seemed so much drier for me than Galaxy Trucker did.  I think that part of it is that rather my mind started searching rather quickly for the piece that I wanted rather than the more free form building that takes place with me in Galaxy Trucker.  The tension seemed to be missing.  This is Galaxy Trucker set in a Zen Buddhist garden.

I left feeling that while it borrows mechanics from Galaxy Trucker, it doesn't end up being as much fun.  While many complain about the second half of Galaxy trucker, for me that's where it's most fun, proving your design.  Here after your done building the only test of how well you designed is your point score.

Rated a 4 with three players.  Could be talked into playing again, but I'm really not interested in doing so.

Mondo is one of those obnoxious games that, for reasons beyond my knowledge, seem to be delighted when they may punish their players for playing: if they only could, they would also strip you of everything you have and beat you up badly whenever you make a mistake just because you haven’t mastered their exquisite mechanics.

There’s no fun, no pleasure, no point to play such a game as Mondo: it’s only frustration and wasted time.

It's a speed-puzzle game that rewards people that can memorize the best types of patterns for the given "special bonus/penalty card" that is in effect.  It's okay fun right now with 7-minute rounds, but I think it will get old once I get familiar with the patterns.  Some tile shapes don't exist and others are in very short supply... so memorizing and quickly snatching key pieces seems like it will be a factor with experienced players.

A less fun version of Galaxy Trucker that plays in 1/3rd the time. Some people like this more, but I find the scoring in this less fun. A friend of mine new to board gaming (who I would have thought this appeals to more) said while he liked the real time idea, the tiles lacked theme and the rules felt strange with the theme. I thought it was a fun way to play one last game in an hour, but in retrospect, I just wish we had played 1 hour of Galaxy Trucker instead (round 1 only basically)

Tough game to rate since I really suck at it and thus I'm not too eager to play the game more. 

Production quality of the game is good, and the mechanics are fluent and simple enough for the target audience. There's definitely enough challenge even for more experienced players but the modular structure of the game makes it easy for new games to learn the game. I can also see why some gamers might get hooked into the game but Mondo has not got such magic for me.

RATING: 7
A very good multi-player puzzly solitaire type game if you're into that sort of thing if you don't also mind the speed element.  As for myself, I dig this type of game, so I really enjoyed it!

At it's core, you're grabbing tiles to form a landscape, following a couple basic placement rules.  Once the time is up, the landscapes are evaluated on various criteria, with most points winning!  So, you'll want to balance the various ways of scoring points, which is tough when under the pressure of the timer.

However, the base game is a bit simplistic, so we went straight for the added complexity which comes in the way of special goal tiles that reward you for completing certain tasks.  It really adds very little to complexity, while adding to the decision-making of what to go after in a round.

Overall, this game reminded me a lot of the first half of a round of Galaxy Trucker.  Both games are a scramble to grab tiles and build something out of them.  However, Galaxy Trucker has the added fun of then seeing how your creation fares over the course of some events, whereas your creation is simply scored in Mondo.  Galaxy Trucker scores a few points higher as a result, in my opinion, but Mondo is still a very fun game in it's own right.

Mondo was surprisingly interesting! I am torn between a rating of 6.5 and 7 but ended up with 6.5 as that’s probably what it will be a year from now. What makes Mondo a good game is the time aspect! I like to place my tiles in the smartest way possible, but you have to make a compromise because of the time! I liked the various ways of scoring points and you constantly need to balance the different ways, all without making any or at least as few mistakes as possible! 

Personally I will never play on the easiest setting but the expert is good because of the time limit of just 5 minutes. I don’t think the extra scoring tiles in the expert add anything special to the game; in fact you might be blinded by your desire to complete those goals that you end up neglecting other stuff.

While you do build your own board, there is some interaction. You take tiles from the same general supply, and when playing on the intermediate level you need to take a look at how the other players are doing to achieve the goal for the round. Also, you need to be aware not to take most volcanoes! The rule that the player with the most points in the previous round gets the “inactive volcanoes = active volcanoes”-tile is quite clever and helps to even things out. New players will probably get crushed by experienced players, but there are many (official) ways you can handicap more experienced players.

All in all Mondo was a nice surprise and is definitely a good family game. Oh, and it only takes 15-20 minutes to play and an additional 5 minutes of scoring – what’s not to like?!

It's about time I updated my rating on this game. I have played it more now and I like it more because I got more a grasp on what pieces to go for. The game is basically the ship building part of Galaxy Trucker with a scoring after completing a world. It's not as exciting as Galaxy Trucker and the game is more repetitive with it's play, but the game does have a more family friendly theme and is more simplified.

If you like galaxy trucker...

That's what I read somewhere, so I tried this out.  Actually picked this up for a friend, and it's an ace game.  The timer keeps games quick and puts some pressure on.  A great filler.  With two additional levels of complexity beyond the basic game, there's plenty of room to grow the experience once you've mastered the base game.  The components are attractive, not outstanding but pleasant to look at and hold.  The game play of course is a mad rush just like Galaxy Trucker, and I enjoy it for similar reasons.  Building the grid with correct connections, etc, reminds me of many early 8 bit video games.

Mondo is Galaxy Trucker Light. My girlfriend enjoys it, so other than it's big brother, Mondo gets some table time. Despite from that, I really liked Mondo the first few times I played it. But after some games, some strong building patterns emerged and in the end, the game (even with the included variants) feels a little to samey for me to request it over and over again.

This was quite a delightful surprise.  It is a lighter Galaxy Trucker. In Galaxy Trucker you build a space ship and then use it (3 rounds)--cards can hurt you or deliver bonuses.  In Mondo players build their land mass and then score it over 3 rounds, and similarly cards & extra tiles deliver bonus points or count against you.  Both have timers (Mondo has a nifty looking mechanical timer, but it didn't work.)

Players simultaneously place land tiles taken from the central area.  Points are awarded for isolating land areas, and for animals; points deducted for volcanoes. There is a neat mechanic for controlling potential run away leaders.  

There is a basic game, then the more interesting version using bonus tiles. 

I like both Galaxy Trucker and Mondo.  Mondo takes much less time to play, and is less fiddly.  Galaxy Trucker is more humerous.  Glad I have both.

To say any plusses, this game looks beautiful and probably does real-time frenzy the best any game of this kind does. But this isn't my kind of game. Too chaotic, too rewarding for visually-strong people, too many opportunities to lose points. Clearly, it is a game that one can get really good at. But this is just not a type of game I feel inspired to get better at. There are some real-time games I enjoy, but this one just puts me in an uncomfortable panic, and then makes you do it three times in a row. Clearly a game with thought behind it, but doesn't really capture what I enjoy about board games.

Another Zooloretto variant, bleeehhh... Wait! It has a timer! So what?

It turns out that the timer really makes the game. If it wasn't for it I would sell the game in a blink of an eye. But the tension and fun resulting from the use of timer and simultaneous tile choosing/grabbing is really enjoyable.

More than the sum of its parts - that's for sure. Worth playing.

The difficulty scaling is really good. The beginners level is like a jigsaw puzzle with a timer. The advanced level brings in risk and decision making and can feel a bit tense. Simple, but good artwork will appeal to younger and older players alike. The game has it's own timer, which is a nice bonus :)

This was billed to me as "like Galaxy Trucker without the part where you destroy your ship", and it does feel a lot like the shipbuilding phase.

But you don't skip the part where you fail horribly and feel bad! That part is just a lot faster and less narrative in Mondo.

So this fixes the worst part of Galaxy Trucker (how long it takes to teach and play, for a game that should be a light romp) while sacrificing the second-best part (how comical the whole thing is). They both have a place on my shelf, yet I'm a little sad that this will get more play.

I hear that according to Bruno Faidutti, Mondo is the fun half of Galaxy Trucker (i.e., the active ship building part). While I do agree that it is fun to whip together some 'micro-climates' (or whatever), I feel like I'm missing a larger sense of purpose (beyond scoring points). Perhaps that is why it is meant to be a game that plays in three 5-minute rounds or so and GT, who knows! I think I might still be more interested in playing GT (not that I have at the time of writing this) -- or, if given the choice, Factory Fun (because the tile grab, in its very singular form, has very big consequences throughout the game).

Clever game. Deserves a higher score for most gamers. I just struggle with timed games. I don't really like to play this more than once in a session but everyone else does. Please think of this as more like a 7 or 8 but just not for me.

A very light solitare puzzle game. Grab Carcassonne-like tiles in real time and make the neatest map you can. Some scoring nuiances add interest, and the timer keeps things moving. It's all fine enough but I can't help but prefer a more elegant solitare puzzle like Fits or Bits.

Mondo is a quick and enjoyable tile laying game with an earth-friendly theme.

Actually Mondo is rather like playing only the ship-building portion of Galaxy Trucker- a race against time and the other players to put together the best set of tiles.

It has a solo option, but this is less interesting than the head-to-head play, which is reasonably family friendly, plays quickly, and you end up with a built out board, feeling like you have created something at least.

Probably lighter than most of Michael Schacht's fare, it has his trademark accessibility, decent theme and artwork, and a good price point.

What's not to like?  Starting this at a 7.

Puzzling your world under time constraints offers quite some fun. Experienced games should move to the more difficult levels with shorter timeframes as the novice level will soon bore them. 

The solitaire play does not offer great replayability. Even with only 5 minutes on the timer, the world can be build quite easily in a way to not receive negative scores. These rules should be seen rather as introductory rules for getting to know the system.

Mondo can be compared to Galaxy Trucker and will in my opinion see a much greater audience due to its theme and easier accessibility.

'Speed-Carcassonne' ... well, sort of.

Common pool of tiles, grab what you want and play them on your own board against the clock, looking to build little areas of contiguous colours while grabbing as many tiles with animal icons on them, and as few tiles with volcano icons on them, as possible.

Mondo is a fun competitive puzzle if you're into that. All players grab tiles from the middle of the table at the same time and try to build up their island the best.

I like the idea of the game, since I tend to really enjoy speed/pattern recognition games. And since it's a Schacht, I'm sure there are lots of things that were stripped out which can now be implemented back in as mini-expansions. But I found the game to be uninspiring. A fun way to pass the time, but not frantic or competitive enough to merit regular play.

I wasn't too excited by the real-time and random interaction aspects of this. It seems like there should be more configurations among the tiles and a more even distribution among the configurations.

I'm pretty serious gamer. I enjoy games like Le Havre, Agricola, Cuba, Puerto Rico etc. Why would I want anything to do with Mondo? I don't know. There is something done very right in it. It feels good. It's very simple, plays super fast, and you can teach it to anyone within minutes. Yet building your very own paradise is hard, and you have to do constant microdecisions. It doesn't have much interaction, but, well, on the other hand it kind of does have some. Mondo is one of my very favourite light weight games, and it has tons of replayability.

Take the fun part of Galaxy Trucker, add simple (Carcassonne) placement rules and a harmless, family-friendly theme: that’s what Mondo offers. It’s fine as a gateway, it’s fun until it lasts but it’s nothing great and even with the advanced rules it feels a bit repetitive. Still, a winner when it comes to family playing or playing some light and fun games with newbies.

If you enjoy the building the ship aspect of Galaxy Trucker but dislike the adventure card aspect, this game could be for you!  FYI, I'd just play the advanced game right off the bat.

LIKES:

* Seven or so different ways to score points!
* Cute timer - although I question the durability of said timer.  
* Everyone has the same amount of time to complete terraforming their world.  If you finish earlier, you will get a couple more bonus points.
* I like the goals/tasks for the expert level.  This really gives the game a bit more purpose as you look to do more than just make a perfect land mass.
* Tiles are doublesided and you can use either side.  One side is all the same type of land, the other side is usually some combination of different types of terrain.
* The game rewards making clean connections and closing in your areas and penalizes poor connections.
* A game is over in no more than 21 minutes!

DISLIKE:

* I wouldn't mind seeing different types of maps created for the gameboards.  Right now, everyone starts with the same globe shaped playing area surrounded by water.  Variations would add more replayability.

This game feels a lot like the ship-building half of Galaxy Trucker. You madly try to assemble an island full of animals before the time runs out. The higher scoring tiles are harder to place, and there is frequently a moment of panic when you realize you've made a mistake but aren't allowed to fix it.

The components are all nice, and the inclusion of a timer makes the game feel special. I'm terrible at the game however, as my wife has a much better aptitude for puzzles than I do, so much so that I feel I can't win. While that won't stop me playing, it is something that prospective buyers would want to be aware of; this is a fast-paced game that doesn't allow time for contemplation and calculation.

Mondo is a superb game. It manages to be both tense and relaxing: tense because of the ever-ticking timer, and the pressure from group real-time tile selection, but also relaxing because you're kind of off on your own building a puzzle with pretty landscapes and animals. It's a fun balance.

It's easy to teach, plays quickly, and delivers a satisfying experience. I particularly like the fact that while its footprint in terms of rules is small, there's quite a bit of decision-making going on under the hood.

You can go in with a plan, so there's strategy, but that plan's going to need to change quite a bit over time. Add to that the great graphic design, quality components, and clear rules -- with step-ups for experienced players -- and this is just an all-around excellent package.

Good for non-gamers, good as a gateway, and the advanced and expert options look like they'd offer plenty to keep track of for gamers who want to up the tension.

If you (or more likely others you play with, we're reading this comment on boardgamegeek after all) feel overwhelmed by Galaxy Trucker, this is a fun alternative. I don't think animal surroundings are as exciting as exploding spaceships (each for their own, maybe you do, if you hate sci-fi for some reason), but you can teach and play this in like 20 minutes so..

As for me, I will play every now and then when my kids or wife ask, patiently waiting for the moment my daughter has built up the skill to give me a run for my money (she is starting to get pretty good already at the puzzle element, but needs to get a lot faster still). I am looking forward to that day and more plays once she hits that level!

Nothing wrong with game - it is my tip for SdJ 2011 along with Blockers. But I don't like puzzleing with time pressure, so it is no game for me. If you don't mind that aspect this seems to be a perfect family game with interesting variants for gamers.

A wonderful game for almost all ages, and a great gateway game to boot. Although it's half the game of Galaxy Truckers (the first half), I find it more fun. The A-B-C round progression is perfect for teaching the ramp-up to the advanced version of the game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
The game is about making a puzzle in a race against the clock.

The mechanism is quite similar to Galaxy Trucker, but:
-> Once you have your world built, you do nothing with it.
-> There seems to be a big difference between players, just because of their innate skill. Galaxy Trucker compensates that a bit with the random cards and the order of play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
First impression (3 players): We played 3 rounds always upping the "difficulty" along the way. The game is pretty much the Galaxy Trucker's ship building phase with less restrictions and of course way different way to score. Not sure if building is just right or too simple / restricted. I like the fact that most volcanos are on tiles with most different areas making scoring plenty of perfect areas harder and/or painful because of volcano minuses.

Some of the goals seem kind of too easy in some situations so not sure if those are good or not since they're pretty easy to block if you take them instantly but on the other hand pretty easy to take if nobody pays enough attention (and really, who has time in realtime game?). 

Overall pretty fun realtime game.

Gioco molto semplice che in alcuni versi mi ha ricordato, il più bello, Galaxy Trucker. Gioco di destrezza e velocità nel costruire il nuovo mondo rispettando delle semplici regole, o cercando i farlo, popolando il mondo di animali ma non di vulcani. Esistono delle modalità differenti, dalle più semplici alle avanzati con obiettivi variabili. Giochino a mio parere passabile anche se non è stato per nulla piaciuto da mia moglie e quindi ho subito rimesso in vendita.

RATING: 6.8
Infuriatingly good tile-snatcher, like Galaxy Trucker but without the randomness. A surprisingly steep curve to this one: the quirks of the tile selection have been cunningly built in, and there is a remarkable amount of calculation-on-the-go. Always seems to go over with serious gamers better than predicted.

Mondo is a simultaneous tile laying game. It comes with boards for 1-4 players, 136 double-sided landscape tiles, some bonus score "cards" (they're tiles, but don't go on your board) and a lclockwork timer.

Competing against the clock and each other, players try to fill their landscape boards with matching tiles, collecting scores for regions, animals and other combos. The tile pool is in common.

It is very similar to Galaxy Trucker, but without the final phase. It plays faster and is less random, but perhaps is less challenging. I prefer Mondo. There is a fun solo variant. Mondo has become one of my favourite fillers.

Update, 2015 : sadly we seem to have stopped playing it. Still a fine game, but has not had an outing for over 12 months

RATING: N/A
Difficult game, but fun to play! Each player has a personal board which has space to build. While being timed, players scramble to find landscape tiles that will connect together to completely fill the space on their boards. Every round there are bonus points for all sorts of things. You try your best to capitalize on these bonuses but usually you just have to fill your board any way you can. Bonuses can include things like having the most animals of a certain type on your board in completed land areas or finishing your board first in a round, etc. 

There are plenty of penalties too...like being unable to complete land areas or blank spaces on your board or mismatched edges of tiles. This game has wonderful components (a round earth kitchen timer). If you like tile laying games like Carcassonne or Galaxy Trucker, you might enjoy this game as well.

Grabbing the pieces you want before the others get to them, a la Galaxy Trucker, but instead of building a ship, you're trying to build diagonally shaped fields (which look similar to Knizia's old "LotR: The Search" game). So the game is all about hunting as fast as possible for tiles to build and then close as many fields as you can on your own personal board. Apart from closing fields, there's a bunch of other ways to earn points - you want animals, you don't want volcanos, but the best closing fields have volcanos on them. Each round will have different bonus rules that you'll strive to build. You play a game in 5-7 minutes, it's timed, and then repeat. But each round is much the same as the other, and the novelty wears off quickly. There's a fast pattern recognition skill to be learnt to do well, but it's too solitaire and too quiet to be fun, and too monotonous to warrant replay solitaire style. The challenge is the race against the clock, but induced time pressure is the cloak behind which it hides its sins.

Great gateway, especially for people who enjoy puzzles. Setup time is almost non-existant and the gameplay is fast (full round takes about 15-20 minutes max, with scoring).

There's a lot of tension and enjoyment in the race to get the rarest tiles and also some strategic thinking required when you play with the goals and missions. After 10 plays it seems it doesn't get old, at least for now. Contrary to my initial impressions, experience is very important in "Mondo". With every play my worlds are more intricate and score more points! I recommend it for young & old alike, for children and for parents.

It's like they re-themed and simplified Galaxy Trucker's ship building mechanic, then added a bunch of frustrating scoring options.

I may have liked this better if the tiles weren't so limiting. There is only one tile for grass, desert, or forest that closes off a zone without requiring four pieces and creating an ugly square, then thr game has the nerve to punish you for each zone unfinished.

Overall, this felt more like a game of Set, where muscle memory is more important than actual skill.

Kind of like Galaxy Trucker without the flying through space part!

Played a few games of this, all at beginner's level. I was originally rubbish at this game, and had the amazing ability of grabbing all the tiles with active volcanoes on them. I'd like to think that I improved with practice and have developed a keen eye for tiles with animals on them, but in truth it's because I'm playing with a different bunch of people each session, and they're all progressively worse than I am at this game. 

This plays like Ubongo, only less puzzle-like. The scoring system is also tighter than Ubongo's, but also a lot more complicated as there are a number of different objectives to score.

A quickplaying game where you have to make a tricky puzzle in about three minutes. 
The puzzle concists of a piece of land with multipel landtypes,like forest and desert, surrounded with water and packed with dangerous vulcanos and different kinds of animals. 
All players have there own playerboard and work simultaneous fighting agains the clock. 
When time runs out you see who made the best land without any faults (because these give you minuspoints).
As this wasn´t enough fun there is also achivements you can take, like having the biggest forest or at least 4 tigers. 

An awesome game that plays in just 15-20 minutes! 
Countless replayability.
It is also very beautiful to watch your puzzle/land after it is done, to see what it turned in to. :)

Mondo has been a huge hit with my family - I've had to buy 3 copies already (2 as gifts for my son in Portland and my daughter in San Francisco after they couldn't get enough while visiting). It's one of those rare games that non-gamers can learn quickly, but appeals to gamers as well.

It plays a bit like Carcassone, with the idea being to add tiles to a display and score points for various arrangements. The biggest difference is that each player is working on their own board, with a timer running. That makes it sound like multi-player solitaire, and it is to some extent, but not entirely because you're all drawing from a common pool of tiles.

The tiles have jungle, desert, grass and water terrain areas, and may also have animals (good) and/or volcanoes (bad). You get points for enclosed areas that have all the same sort of terrain, and pay penalties for terrain edges that don't match.

It all sounds simple, and it is, but it's also quite addictive. There are also some advanced game options to provide more challenge and variety.

I'm not sure a simple "what you do" description does the game justice. What I will say is that everyone who has tried it, including my 80-something mother-in-law, had a great time playing it, and the cutthroat gamers in the family were up playing a series of "just one more" games after the less serious sorts had gone to bed.

The timer goes up to 10 minutes, but that's more than you need. We were playing 6 minute rounds, and the speedier players were finishing in half that. There's very little setup, so the listed 20 minute playing time is legit.

Bottom line, I strongly recommend this to people looking for a light game that plays quickly. It's the best I've seen in that category for some times.

If you like puzzle games, Mondo is a good choice.  It plays up to 4 in one box, but you can expand is you have more copies.  I really recommend playing this with the full rules as it increases the difficulty of the game tremendously and turns it into a nice game with tough decisions about  how you build your island.

****EDIT****

I upgraded my rating from 6.5 to 7.  This game is a lot more fun when played with more than 2 players.  The competition for tiles makes it much tougher to get what you want.  It also really puts a wrinkle in the bonus tiles.

First impression: Galaxy trucker without the adventure part. Some players liked it more because of that, but for me it is just the 'work' part of GT without the 'fun' part. Still a nice game.

Real-time games and myself aren't usualy compatible - in other words: I suck at playing them. This however I managed to win a great couple of times. Can't imagine now why I didn't want to play it at essen last year at first ... luckily I had no choice. :)

the thing that keeps me from rating this past an 8 is the extra scoring cards.  just playing the basic game is absolutely fantastic.  its nobodys fault but your own if you have a bad game of this.  nobody can mess you up, nobody can take you down.  nobody can keep you from deploying your strategy.  its an absolutely fantastic game and one i will probably never get rid of.

Actually a very ok game. Seems to be very simple, but the good outcome is quite hard to accomplish. At least in the first game.

To me this game looks like an easier version of the Galaxy Trucker. It is really great fun to play with the whole family, because even small children will understand what it is about. 3 levels of difficulty gives us an opportunity to experience some challenge. One bad thing I found in the game is that playing with less than maximum number of players is too easy, because there is no worry that any player will not be able to finish his world due to the lack of the elements.

An entertaining family game that is, however, largely a solitaire affair. Especially if the players are not equally skilled in pattern recognition or do not have roughly the same amount of plays under their belt. Once I grasped how to earn major points, my interest in playing this game faded somewhat. The solo variant is not interesting at all. All in all not as good as Galaxy Trucker, but allright to bring to the table every now and then.

I am usually fan of puzzle games, but this one seemed to me a bit bland and uninteresting. The rules are not too difficult but it is not super elegant neither. The scoring of areas and penalties are not that intuitive.

RATING: 7
This is a good, light game that doesn't take itself too seriously.  Easy to teach for all ages while allowing for some strategy in its gameplay.  Problem is that the game reduces social interactions (i.e. each player works simultaneously on their own personal map/puzzle) while allowing players to cheat (by purpose or not).

This is like just doing the first part of "Galaxy Trucker", and then scoring based on how well you built your ship.  This makes it a distinct improvement over Galaxy Trucker, as I don't care for 50%+ of a game being decision-less and random resolution.

Timed puzzle-building aspect of Galaxy Trucker... would like to find a copy for a reasonable price.

Not to be confused with the much lighter "Mondo - Der Rasante Legespa Board Game"

Commented after two games. Simple puzzle game. I need to play more with the advanced and expert rules to find out how deep this game really is. At least it is simple, fast, easy to teach and so on. Looks good, too.

Add two more games, but still without advanced rules, so it is quite hard to say anything more.

Two more games, but still without advanced rules. I believe I must insist the extra rules next time, or I will get too bored. :)

Another two games, still with the basic rules... And one more...

For those of you who enjoy the ship-building part of Galaxy Trucker more than the rest of the game, this might be the game that fills that niche for you.  It's all about building your best world with the fewest errors.  There are other aspects of the game that lead to scoring points, but really, that efficiency building seems to be the heart of the game.  I've only played it solitaire so far, and there are still three levels of play to try in the multiplayer game, so I feel like there's still a lot to explore, but so far, it's a charmer.

Real time puzzle game. Short, clean and I enjoyed it although I'm not good at this type of game (same goes for Galaxy Trucker). Note though that with this sort of game, players should be of the game skill level in order to avoid frustration.

Ich mag den Puzzlecharakter des Spiels und die leichte Hektik. Auch wenn ich IMMER! gegen meine Freundin verliere. Geht in allen Besetzungen gut. Wenn man zu viert spielt wird es deutlich schwieriger die richtigen Karten zu bekommen, ohne aktive Vulkane in Kauf zu nehmen.

A lot similar to Galaxy Trucker - building island vs ship with map vs ship tiles in limited time. It is perfectly made game in every aspect, except that it's just not that interesting - partly because of theme. Building spaceship in Galaxy Trucker is a lot more fun.
I'm rating higher for the fact that game is very children friendly (mine 5 year old likes it) - easy to learn, no text, and limited time instead of deep calculations.

It is a real time game so not my favorite type of games. The basic game (build without mistakes) is good for kids and non-gamers.The second level (added bonuses) seems like it would be the best for most people. The expert game (sets of animals) is for those that really like the fast paced.

The only game we played @Spiel 2011. Nice game, which we had to abort, because the author, Michael Schacht, wanted to play a 10 player game. He needed our table, to setup the 10-player game. And everbody knows the rule at a game fair. What the author wants, is the law.

Depending on your playing style quick and chaotic or slow strategic. Nice new idea and it also adds some rules/mechanics to handicap the player who is always winning or is experience with the game. Sadly the timer broke after only a few play - trying to get it replaced atm...

Ungewöhnliche Spielidee, schön umgesetzt und der Schwierigkeitsgrad lässt sich selber variieren. Auf Zeit puzzlet man sich eine Insel zusammen, wobei man darauf achten muss, dass die Regionen (Wald, Wüste, Wasser,...) korrekt aneinander grenzen und genug Tiere beheimatet sind. Weil man gleichzeitig spielt, besteht immer die Gefahr, dass die Gegener einem das letzte passende Teil klauen. Hektisch, aber enorm spaßig! Sogar alleine.

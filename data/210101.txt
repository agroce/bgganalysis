INCorporated is a game about today’s world: mega-corporations seize political power for their goals and profit, wars are waged for money, and executives decide the fate of the world.
The premise is quite interesting, at it definitely delivers some good gaming vibrations!
Mechanically, the game is reminiscent of Imperial, with a dose of Twilight Struggle-like appeal.
On the cons side, one must consider the really long playing time, and a little bit of kingmaking (though, with area control and all these interwoven mechanics, it would be difficult not to have some...).
A fascinating game, however, with a very good potential!

Not sure on this one yet. The stock valuation (bids allowing prices to fluctuate - 
which partially sets an immediate sale) is an interesting mechanism. It's hard
to value shares given this though. Will take at least another play to get a feel.

Interesting theme and some solid ideas,but needed a bit more development. After reading the rulebook was intrigued by the theme of portraying large-scale economics as warfare. And to that extent, the treatment of the subject matter is well put together. This is fore mostly an auction and area majority game, with a lot of take that. The idea of a buy+sell auction in one package is an innovation I have not seen before, as is the dual block-of-power network that corporations need to navigate to be able to move their assets. Good stuff!

Where the game lost me, however is in its tediousness of continuously counting/monitoring majorities, which is made worse by the design and color scheme of the board, and the chaos factor of the end-of-turn lobbying actions. The lobbying actions make the game harder to strategize, and the designer sort of declares this in his notes. However, with this increase in toughness, there is no additional fun to be had. Also, the direct manipulation of the various sliders through these actions seemed a cheap mechanism, to me.

Overall, not a bad game, and a game that I would love to see having a re-cast. Especially since the auction mechanism is unique and really interesting. Barely recommended.

+ Great theme and treatment of economics-as-warfare
+ Great auction mechanism
+ Interesting spatial puzzle of balance-of-power networks

= Lots of take that and confrontation

- Tedious continuous counting of majorities
- The lobbying phase increases the chaos factor without any extra enjoyment
- Cards are easy to chip and mark, since they are black

I'm the mentioned "father" in this article: https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1656793/incorporated-designers-diary

Despite my son's best efforts to explain the rules to me and include me in the test runs, I admit that I couldn't finish a single round of the game as it is a bit too complex for my taste (I'm more of a Scrabble guy) :)

That being said, I'm giving my son's game 9, because I'm the first-hand witness to his efforts to literally wasting months to "perfect the design" (in his words).

17/2/2016 - Really enjoyed the first game at 4 players. The game covers many different mechanics in a very good and in an enjoyable way (bidding, reverse bidding, area control, stock holding, worker placement).
As for the economic/geopolitical theme, it captures micro/macro economic elements in combination with geopolitics in a very smooth and fluid manner. Unique game indeed, fun to play, and looking forward to getting it to the table again.

Economic game with some aggression. Feels a little like Twilight Struggle meets 18xx, but without the trains :)

I have playtested the game twice, which is probably the first Eurogame designed in Turkey for the European/North American market. If you like economic games and are bored of the lack of action and aggression in most of them, Incorporated is highly recommended. It combines common bidding and asset control mechanics in economic games with a much more realistic translation of global economic trends into tracks and mechanics. Thematically, player competition is embedded in a background of global political conflict between two superpower blocs, which also adds solid flavor to gameplay.

Played at spiel'16.
1x 3-player game
I copy here my comment from the spiel'16 thread :

The game is indeed quite interesting to play. We may actually had more fun during the explanation than the game proper, since we were always justifying every single rule point by real-world comparisons. Even more so than what's already (under)stated or in the rulebook. Hilarious. From a certain point of view. The game DOES make sense. Damn. Maybe too much.

(Sidenote : Keep in mind that it might be percieved as being somewhat politically orientated by some people (:D)).

It was very late, so the gaming in itself wasn't "fun" but a very concentrated and enjoyable fight against others, and sleep, a bit hindered by minor design issues (see below).

We only played a half game, due to time constraints. We all enjoyed the game and all considered very seriously to buy it. However only 6 copies were left and we were most likely to play it together. It made more sense to only get one copy and give other gaming groups the oportunity to experience the game and help it get the good word of mouth that it will certainly get.

Here are our very minor concerns, based on our very limited experience.

- The first game takes WAY more than 2 hours (it might help to start before midnight and not to have had beer during diner).

- We all enjoyed the graphic design pretty much and all component are of very good quality except the cards. Black backs are often a bad choice since the rapidely get marked on the sides (happened during the game). Sleeves are necessary.

- Possible analysis paralysis during the competition phase (again late hours do not help), mainly due to the difficulty of determining the majorities in the 5 types of industries. A dedicated track or, preferably, tokens or cardboard plates (similar to the shares) would help smoothen this phase. We consider buying poker tokens in relevant colors to pimp up our copy (à la splendor)

- "End of the world" feeling during the last turn, like in the first serenissima edition (méditerranée in france). But since that's the same for everyone...


That being said, I enjoyed the game very much. It probably is in the top 3 games of spiel'16 in its category. I will definitely look forward to other opportunities to play it and keep an eye on the second printrun, since I am still very interested in getting a copy myself.

This was a big suprise for me,it came from nowhere and hands down is nominated for "game of the year".

Ostensibly this is a game about shadowy corporates taking over the world. It's actually an oddball auction game in which players bid for the chance to take actions, now there's a mechanism where it's hard to evaluate what you're bidding on... You can also arbitrarily attack your opponents and if you get picked on sufficiently often, you're out of contention and there's not much you can do. All of this creates a strong rich-get-richer element and in a long game (set aside the whole evening) that's not really acceptable. Not one for me.

There are so many levers to pull on this game it is really hard to rate it after just one play. It would be interesting to get some plays in a short period of time. Forget the comparisons to Imperial, this is something completely different besides the fact it is played on a map and the theme is about investors making profits from exploring other people. I love the fact the winning condition is simple (most money wins, period), but there are very different things to do during the game. I was somewhat annoyed by the fixed player order, as it meant the players in 3rd or 4th would very rarely get the actions they wanted in the last phase.

Amazing quality components. Flavours of Imperial 2030 and hints of Twilight Struggle, with a unique style. Love it. Need to play more to really understand it.

Theme well implemented in de mechanics of the game, not a bad design. Still the game took 4 hours on first play which is way too long. And the game with all its phases and different elements feld very procedural and slow because of that. And don't bid too high on the shares. If you want to make a profit on your shares in the game, don't bid any higher than $5-8. If you pay $20-25 per share as 3 out 4 players did in our game, then you have lost the game in the first round already.

Pros:
Great game combining warfare and economy
Easy to keep track of board and other players
Really gives you the economic war feeling 
Good lore, good design. 
Cons:
The rules are somewhat hard to digest completely to create an in-situ strategy at the beginning of the game immediately.
People who hate war games might not enjoy this to its full potential.

Un buen juego de acciones, algo complicado y farragoso quizás de entender y, sobretodo, saber cuanto cuesta cada acción.

Played a nice self-made version bought from the designer at Essen.
An interesting fresh idea about arena control tied to shares, and some economics. Definetly for people who enjoy some nice thinking, and negative interaction. 
Should do very nicely on Kickstarter.

A grand strategic game about megacorporations, with shades of "Imperial". Interesting, but maybe a little too random in various mechanics (Outlook and Payout cards, die rolls to flip countries allegiance).

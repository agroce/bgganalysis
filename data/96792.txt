A refreshingly unusual theme which is both intriguing and true it's literary source in feel. Unfortunately, the game boils down to play a card, draw a card.

RATING: 8
This was one of the most pleasant surprises for me, because the game is very good, and because the theme is so unexpected and makes so much sense. We are absolvers of the 7 capital sins, but more than that, we sells sins to passangers of the road of Canterbury so we can absolve latter, there is a lot of ways to score points on this game. The flow of this game is super simple and everything you do can and will be used against you from other players, what gives this game a good interaction.

RATING: 5.5
A family friendly game that does not have such a friendly theme to it. 

Play a card/color, put a cube on the board, put more cubes gain more points. Once the pilgrim dies, another takes its place and the cube cycle starts again. 

Because it's for only 3 players, the game is not that long. Plays well and has beautiful board and cards. 

Overall, an average game with little depth but good enough for a family to gather n play.

Interesting game that radiates the wry, dark humor of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. You score by pardoning various Pilgrims on the way to Canterbury, and then replacing them once they've gotten enough (seven) cards placed near them to perish. There are bonus scoring options and Relics to help vary gameplay and screw with the other players. Cool idea, even the artwork on the game board is classically inspired.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This light card-game feels like it's carefully constructed and well thought out.  You can tell where the designer intended there to be tension and tricky decisions but it still comes off a bit vanilla to me.

players "invest" sin cards on to three different pilgrim caravans.  Pardoning those sins gets you points, and the more sins of the same type, the more points you get.  However you can rarely do more than one thing in a turn, so playing a bunch of the same sin cards will more than likley just set up a rival for a big score.

There are some clever ways that the cards circulate.  Pilgrims die after 7 sin cards are played on them but some cards get played without the player's control which makes the game less predictable (in a good way).

Players can also get a sizeable bonus by ignoring the "main" game of focusing on pardons and simply try and spread as much discord and sin as possible.

everything seems to line-up nicely for a fun tactical game.  The theme is right, and the ideas are true, but perhaps it's too subtle for me to really latch onto so far.

At least it's fast.  So I wouldn't mind playing it a few more times before final judgement.  As it stands I think that Wyatt Earp has some similar mechanics but is more fun.

Igazi ritkaság, amire én talán nem leltem volna rá (de más rálelt:)), örülök, hogy lehetőségem volt kipróbálni! A véleményem felemás...
Egyfelől a játék az egyik legigényesebb, amivel valaha játszottam, a tábla design, a doboz elrendezés, a rekordvastag lapkák, és a minőségi kártyák csábítanak a játékra (mondjuk ennyi pénzért csábíthatnak is:)). A téma nagyon egyedi, a 7 főbűnnel kell kísértésbe vinni zarándokokat, ennek megfelelően pl. van bűn, ill. megbocsátás kártyapakli. A tematika egész tűrhetően átjön szerintem. A gondom a játék mechanikájával van. Nem is tudom, valahogy tartalmában a játék nem nő fel a külsőségekhez. Van egy érdekes hangulata, fizikailag tényleg minden elemében különleges (és még az is ritkaságszámba megy, hogy 2-3 fővel játszható), de mégsem átütő mint játék. Talán nem elég mély, vagy nem elég ötletes...
Az asztalunknál felmerült, hogy túl egyértelmű a stratégia, ezzel nem értek egyet. Másik kritika az volt, hogy sokat számít a memorizálás, ki mit húz fel, ebben van valami, de ez sok játéknál megvan szerintem.
Összességében örülök, hogy kipróbáltam.

Kissé száraznak tűnő többségi kártyajáték, ráhúzva egy nem mindennapos téma. (bűnbocsánatárus szerepe)
Mivel több módon is szerezhető pénz (VP), mindenre figyelni szükséges.
A szabályok egyszerűk, a játékidő ideális (max.45 min. - 2 játékos), az újrajátszhatóság garantált, továbbá a játék minősége etalon lehet más játékok számára.
Kezdőkkel is kitűnően játszható. Nem nevezném nyelvfüggetlennek, mert az ereklye (Relic) kártyákon - melyeket titkosan húzunk - van némi idegen nyelvű szöveg. (segédlettel áthidalható a nehézség)

Összességében - ajánlott kategória!
A szabályokat tekintve egy nem túl összetett, kicsit "sótlan"-nak tűnő, de sok VP lehetőséget kínáló, ennek ellenére nagyon is élvezhető, szó szerint "számító" játékot ismerhettem meg.
Csak ismételni tudom, hogy a játék tartozékainak minősége elképesztő, fantasztikus! (a kevés játékaim egyike, amiben nincs csorba kocka, a dobozban mindennek saját helye van, a kártyalapok minősége, rajzolata HQ, stb...)
Bármikor szívesen játszom vele. Úgy gondolom az ideális játékosszám 3 fő.
(mi a tematikusság fokozása érdekében házi szabályt alkalmazva játszunk!)

RATING: 5
One of the nicest boxes of all time. Everything has a place and the components are wonderful. The flavor text on the relic cards is very funny as well. That being said, the first play had real issues. Flow felt odd, and the dominant strategy in our first game was drawing pardons blind, pardoning when able, and killing pilgrims when able. This needs a second play, because there is potential here, but first play was a flop.

RATING: 7
Well, almost everything about this games is UNUSUAL.
The Road to Canterbury has an unusual theme, and I basically bought it for its theme only: the idea of making a business exploiting the beliefs of the faithful is too wonderful to pass on.
It also has an unusual component quality: everything is so thick, linen-finished and wonderful that you can't believe until you touch and see it! I guess it has something to do with the Kickstarter funding... The idea of using real-world art is great (only other game I can think of is Siena) and is a optimal way to convey the theme (only complaint: somewhat some of the images feel slightly low-res, but I don't mind).
The number of supported players is also unusual: when do you see a game marketed for 2-3 players these days? Kudos to the author for the decision of not supporting 4 players (the game would've been too chaotic for sure)!
What about the game itself? Well, it is a challenging medium-light game with a bit of set collection and area influence implemented in unusual (again!) and interestingly interwoven ways, working wonderfully for two! It has a number of gameplay subtleties that are not immediatelt apparent, giving birth to quite a deep experience. A true little gem!

First play. Rules are straight forward enough so we launched in quite quickly. First thoughts were that 2-3 was a very strange number for a game, but ho hum. 

It became quickly apparent that there is a generous slice of luck doled out with this game. The blind draw from one of three deck, the appearance of death cards that can give the next player the chance to 'kill off' the pilgrim, the variance in the relic cards. It all combined to give me the impression that the game was driving the action and the players were just passengers there to enjoy the ride. Somehow the mechanisms just don't seem to gel.

Its OK. Not a game I'd ever buy or rush to play again

Pro's:

1) I love the theme! I am a big fan of the Canterbury tales. This is probably one of the more obscure games in my collection and the one that has the darkest humour.
2) It has a fantastic sweet spot between complexity and ease of teaching. It isn't so complex that it's impossible to teach or so light that it's boring.
3) Aesthetically fantastic, the thick cardboard, big cubes, art of Hieronymus Bosch, the way the board is laid out. Everything fits together really well. A lot of people complain about the coins, which I kind of agree, though I don't think they are that bad. It would be pretty fun to upgrade this to metal coins though. I feel like having that pouch full of metal coins chinking together as you laugh about the unfortunate plight of the pilgrims caused by your own corruption is worth the money.
4) Incredibly well designed in terms of the game mechanics. There's enough compelling choice to make the game interesting but it is all very manageable. I also love the death cards and the relics, they add just the right level of randomness to avoid the game becoming too deterministic.
5) Very quick to play.

Con's:

1) I myself am an atheist and love the theme. Still, I can imagine there would be some people who would find this theme uncomfortable.
2) I don't know why but I had to re-read the rulebook multiple times. I am unsure if it is the way it is written or if I was tired or what, but for whatever reason I found some parts of it to be kind of unclear.
3) I have personally had this constant issue where players forget the tie breaker is sin cards. I feel like this could have been written on the player aids as it is crucial information.

This game intrigues me.  First:A+ for having an unusual theme. Second: A+ for making a three player game that needs no more than that.

Meh. I was really into the theme, but the game design leaves a lot to be desired. Why do all the cards look identical? It was confusing to keep track of what was what, where to put cubes, and the gameplay was totally counter-intuitive. We made several mistakes during our first game, and once we seemed to have gotten it down the game started to feel mechanical. We haven't played since.

This game was somewhat of an impulse purchase - I rarely buy a game based on theme and artwork alone, but I made an exception for this one because it has a unique and interesting theme (this is coming from someone who hated reading Chaucer in high school), and The Seven Deadly Sins and the Four Last Things is one of my favourite paintings by Bosch!  Each player is a pardoner (and peddler) of sin, trying to wrest as many gold coins from the wicked as possible.  The blend of set collection, hand management, and area control fits the theme reasonably well, although sometimes it feels as though one's choice of meaningful actions is limited.  Another concern is the replayability of this game - the Relic cards spice things up, but it is easy to see how this game may become "scripted" over time.  Overall, the game itself is mediocre, but the theme is reflected well and the components are solid.

Looks gorgeous, gameplay doesn't quite live up to the standards of the production. 

Our first run-through was hampered by the one player who isn't a regular gamer pardoning every single turn (pretty much) with only one sin showing - meaning you couldn't realistically build a strategy if you were more of a planning/tactical gamer. 

That said, I can see it'll be great with just the two of us trying to max out points against each other and/or with a different third gamer.

A decent game that's lighter on fun that I had hoped.  Once you get the mechanics down, the flow of the game improves, but you then see the obvious strategy of not setting anyone else up to collect on a pardon.  Very humorous and great theme, but game play isn't very exciting and I don't see a second play.

Wait a minute!  Second play with two flushes out a much better game of being able to set yourself up for more points without the greater chance of opponents stealing your pardons.  Hmmmm...  A third play with 2 players is needed for final judgement.  Bumped rating from 7 to 7.5.
Low replay value bumps this back down to a 7.

Gryphon Games does it again! They continue to give attention to the quality of a game and its components, besides ensuring that they are publishing good games that play well. The Road to Canterbury is a winner! A 2 or 3 player game that oozes with theme but is a very challenging and fun Euro to play. You get to play the bad guy and it is SO satisfying! Winning by being the one who can make the most money off of tempting the travelers from the Canterbury Tales to commit their favorite sins, along with many others. Way cool! LOL! I can't recommend this game enough. Go out and play it, buy it, enjoy it! You won't go wrong. It's fun, fun, fun--and you'll also learn a thing or two along the way! :-)

This game is very curious - it definitely is going to require more plays to see if it's a keeper. It's also unusual to have a game that only allows 2 or 3 players. It's so rare that we have 3 at the table!

The main thrust of the game is adding sin cards to one of three traveling parties, which can then be handled by selling them pardons of the same type. One of the key strategies is to build up plenty of one type of sin to maximize your points. Meanwhile you're trying to claim spots on the wheel of sins and along the road to Canterbury.

Several things going on here and I'm not sure it meshes together very well. The art and theme are well done. Willing to give this another try, for sure.

Need to review the overall power of the Death cards as we found that this changed the game significantly - pushing people to 6 cards and leaving this for the other player to finish them off, get a Last rites token and then take another turn to finish off another person.  Huge game changer - may need to look at a variant to remove a few of the Death Cards to help balance this a little more.

Light and humorous, but unsatisfiying.

The art and component quality are excellent, but the 3-player is a little odd as it seems overly easy capitalize on your opponents plays and kill the pilgrims and then act again.

In my first session I effectively has several turns that were 2 consecutive turns (using last rites tokens) and essentially scooped the 7 deadly sins and 4 spots on the road. Later I did this again, ending the game and engineering the high score on the road. the middle player was squashed. final score. 85-46-85. I won on the tie breaker of the most cubes in the center.

Not horrible, but probably not a good 3-player.

This game has beautiful art and components which help you get into the theme. The theme is interesting because it's both historical and hilarious; it is fun to explain exactly how each pilgrim sins when playing sin cards. There are several paths to victory with some interesting choices along the way. Hand management and press-your-luck seem to be the most prominent mechanics and while the cards have a luck element, it is mitigated by choosing where to play or picking up relic cards.

RATING: 6.8
The theme and production are fantastic. There are a variety of things going on in an otherwise short game, which is unusual. The darkly comedic touches are welcome, and atypical in the hobby.

The Death cards are an inspired mechanic, that while hard to understand at first (the color-coding is unclear until you play), neatly get over the natural hump of players' reluctance to place a 6th card on a pilgrim that would give their opponents an opening. It's also interesting that dead pilgrims stick around in their company, making the next pilgrim that much closer to death. This speeds up the game in a reasonable way and propels it toward the finish.

The majority control on each pilgrim being tied to pardons is interesting. It has the nice effect of driving single-card pardons that otherwise would probably not happen, so in that way it is a nicely compensating mechanic, but it also feeds into the 20 point bonus for majority control of the road, which seems really high.

Overall, I feel this game could've done with more development and streamlining. In general, it feels like Alf's games need an editor to bring focus to his designs (and rulebooks!), and this one is no exception. With its panoply of set collection and majority control mechanics, it will take more plays to figure out how, or if, the different mechanics mesh together. I'm also unsure of the balance with such a point salad. Lastly, the game is also a little fiddly with all the cube placement rules.

My one particular wish for this game is to have some difference between types of sins. There are no synergies or meaning to the seven sin flavors ("flavors", really?), which are just abstract labels driving the primary set collection mechanic. This is probably the biggest miss in a game that is otherwise so thematic.

A note on play: Given that you normally can only take a single card per turn, the opportunity cost of taking a Relic card is pretty high if other players avoid them. I would probably have each player start with a Relic card to give a bit of strategic direction and differentiation. An alternative would be for each player to start with an extra card type of their choice (or just mandate that between the players, one will get an extra starting Sin, another a Pardon, and the last a Relic).

This is a game worth more plays, and I do enjoy having it in my collection based on the theme, the short length, and the specificity to 3 players. It is a nice example of how mechanics can be used to compensate for the weaknesses of others, but ultimately it could've done with more streamlining and more thematic depth.

Thematically, this is a mess. Sinning doesn't involve a pilgrim doing anything, and all the sins are the same. 'Death' cards don't bring a pilgrim closer to death any faster than the other sin cards do. Most of the game is serious (or maybe deadpan) but the holy relics are jokes. And you can't buy anything with money. Pasted-on theme is okay with me, but this was pasted on poorly and has already peeled most of the way back off.

Mechanically, it's area control that's probably decided 2-1-1, or 1-1-1 with a tiebreaker.

Probably all of the sins are more fun to commit than this game is to play, even the crap ones like Wrath.

Another 'meh' game.  Fun, but it just didn't seem new (not that we NEED new).  

The one thing that bothered me was that you had to put a cube each time you played a card the first time until you place one of each, then you can play a second.  So, I would forget to place cubes later in the game.

Los componentes y el diseño del juego es bastante bueno, para ser de producción china está muy bien.

El juego es en realidad un juego de cartas sobreproducido hasta decir ¡basta!, añadido a su precio hace que el juego no sea recomendable. Las mecánicas y el desarrollo son simples, pero el juego se queda corto e insípido.

Tiene una burocracia bastante grande para el juego que es: coloca un cubito aquí, mueve esto allá, etc, aparte de eso, se puntúa por mil cosas y en sitios diferentes, al final uno está mas pendiente de donde puntuar que del desarrollo del juego.

Aunque trate de los pecados capitales, para mi el juego se queda en el limbo: ni bien, ni mal.

RATING: 6
Amazing presentation and components. The artwork and theme is strong and evocative. The game itself is too limiting at 2 or 3 players only. 

The swings of luck aren't mitigated enough by the rest of the mechanics. 

The game plays too fast for there to be any sense of strategy or pro-active gameplay - you sort of feel like the game's running through its paces and you're drily doing the things as instructed, without any real control.

And if you have any excellent card counters with good memories, they'll grieve you every time by "stalking" the sins or pardons you are collecting, and sniping your pardons before you have a chance to do it. I understand this is the underlying strategy in the game, but it's not really that fun to enact in the game. 

I Kickstarted this game, and am happy I did. I also am just as happy I got three plays out of it, and equally as happy to trade away or sell my copy to anyone who likes this more than I do.

RATING: 7
Based on (1) solo 3-player play: this is a fun, interactive, slightly luck-driven (Sin decks) but still quite enjoyable tongue-in-cheek take on the irony of Chaucer and the companions on his Pilgrimage.

I enjoyed the interaction, the dark humor/irony, and the relatively quick gameplay of this 3-player Euro.

The artwork and quality was top rate, and I definitely enjoyed this Kickstarted game.

After a few plays I think this is the correct rating for this game.

The 45 playtime is a definite Virtue here ;-).

My only hesitation in increasing the rating is that I begin to suspect that a strategy of focusing on Pardons brings in more long-term rewards (in Canterbury and Party bonuses) as well as the immediate cash benefit and works best in the end, though all players will want to work on the Wheel of Sin, of course, if only to guarantee plays for the next round.

The main counter-balance I see here is to try to manage/count the pardons available (with visible pardons picked up being helpful here), manage the sins left available for pardons, or to otherwise close down the play options to minimize pardon opprotunities, and possibly even trap other players into penalty situations where they cannot play a card.

But I think these counterplays exist, and that there is a depth of strategy there that warrants additional plays; at 45 minutes, for a gorgeous little game with a lot of wit, that will be easy to arrange.

Revisiting Road to Canterbury after a fairly long hiatus, I am a bit less taken with it than I used to be.  I'm not a big theme guy, but the theme and mechanics don't mesh together terribly well and the underlying system is a little clunky (lots of unintuitive cube placement and movement, lots of ways to score points that don't really integrate thematically).  The game still looks great and is a nice light diversion, but now it seems a little slight to me.  I much prefer Seegert's follow-up Fantastiqa, as it ties everything together much better and is a more interesting game overall.

Hits the ball out of the park on all fronts.  Refreshingly original theme, love the sense of humor and the way the theme plays right into the mechanics with the pilgrim's "sin of choice" etc.  Awesome gameboard based on medieval art by Hieronymous Bosch.  Game play is a medium-weight mix of area influence (implemented in an unusual way), hand management and set collection (also implemented in an unusual way) with some push-your-luck aspects and a good dose of chaos & luck.   A lot of interwoven parts to keep things interesting.  Components and production are top-notch, beautiful, sturdy, great box insert, and the "coin purses" are the highest quality bags I've seen included with a game.  Over all, the highest quality components of any of my games.

I have played this game once and think that's it's quite a decent euro. Although the strategies in this game are not immediately apparent, I feel as if I will "solve" it quite soon. The production quality is astounding! I really really really think they went above and beyond for this small game. I just worry that it won't hold up over time. It was fun and quick for me but I could tell that the others didn't enjoy themselves that much. I will have to try a 2 player game with my girlfriend to see how it holds up. This one is definitely worth a try and some will really take to it.

You entice people to sin just so you can absolve them of those sins later for points, until you've beaten them down so much they finally die and you reap points.  Again, just a game, but I think we can do better than that.

Solid majorities game in several facets of the game that also involves other ways to score.  Production values are top notch as is typical of Gryphon.  Only plays 2 or 3 but does it well.  However, I don't expect to maintain it in my collection.

Stunning materials for a nice and quick card game with a nice touch given by the 2 boards. Solid yet simple mechanism with a tounch of additional unpredictability due to the death cards, which quicken the game quite a lot and give more sense to the theme (it's just like the pilgrims tend to behave according to their own wish rather than yours).
Maybe I'd give the game itself a 6,5 but an extra half point is due to the beauty of the materials.

You might feel a little dirty afterward, but this game is simply awesome! It's so simple: play a card, redraw up to 5, do some basic checks--that's it. One of the things that makes this game so good though, in my opinion, is its simplicity. Most of your turns are 30 seconds or less; they can even be 10 seconds if you are a fast player. Occasionally, you will have a turn (1 out of 5 or so) where you really have some juicy decisions to make. It doesn't grind to a screeching halt; rather, it ratchets up the tension. Moreover, despite the game's simplicity, your decisions are not self-evident. Instead, you are regularly torn in different directions, having to make the most optimal (or fortunate) decision at the time. There is a fair share of luck in the game. Most of that luck comes from card draws. The production is phenomenal. The box is a tank. The boards are all thick cardboard (including the player boards) and the art is great. EGG hit a home-run with this game. I'm fortunate to own it!

This is an excellent game with a unique theme. You are a crooked pardoner tempting pilgrims into sin and then selling them pardons as fast as you can before their sinning ways kill them. Components are stellar, artwork is all period pieces, theme is original and the game is a smooth and elegantly designed euro area control/influence game. This game is an overlooked gem. The only draw back is it is limited to 2-3 players, or it would see more play, and a higher rating. Plays equally well with either number.

12/13/11 Played a three-player game. (Why is Lust shown as Luxury? Political Correctness?) The artwork was nice. I had fun making light of it while we played. I give the game a point for being for three players, as most games ignore this niche. I give it a point for only lasting 69 minutes. The humor on the relic cards was cute. But most of the novel theme of the book was bypassed, to focus on one narrow element. Its like licensing all six Star Wars movies as source material and then creating a game based only on JarJar Binks. It may be a fine game, but come on, its JarJar Binks!  Using bags to hold (hide) one's money seems thematic, but functionally its cumbersome. For you have to then root around in the bag when you have to make change. And you will, many times, for the bank contained not enough 1's and way too many 20's. As to the game itself, it was merely OK. It all works, but it left me with a feeling of "eh". I'd play it again, but I'd never ask for it.

Mistakes made: 
1.  Noone gets last rights bonus a pilgrim dies due to a death card.

3.  Relic cards have a parson icon that allows you to move the parson wherever you want.
4. The pilgrim's preferred sin does not count for a pardon. Only for determining the flavor of a death card.

This is the most beautiful game I have ever seen.  The humorous slant and the well-designed action make the game go very quickly.  I have not played with two players, but it shines with three.  My only complaint is that the scoring is somewhat diffuse and "bitty".  There are so many ways to score that I'm not sure what is a good strategy.  Also, I remove one of each color "DEATH" card from the deck to slow the game a little.  I recommend this highly, especially if your gaming group is small or if you have only one opponent on a regular basis.

The components are really top-notch (high-quality cards, thick cardboard pieces, etc.), and the box insert is a nice puzzle where every thing has its correct place. The theme is great if you enjoy dark humor. (I, for one, took some enjoyment from saying things like, "Ok, for my turn, I'm going to kill the knight by making him a glutton.")

The game moved very quickly and was pretty light, so it seems like it might work well if you want a game where you have to think a little bit, but not too much.

Unfortunately, by the end both my wife & I were somewhat lukewarm toward the gameplay itself. It was fine, but nothing really grabbed our attention. Playing this game gave me a somewhat similar feeling to Ticket to Ride (probably due to some similar mechanics), but I think I'd choose to play Ticket to Ride over The Road to Canterbury 9 times out of 10.

An interesting game designed for just 2 or 3 players, which you don't see too often, and this works just fine in that lightweight 45 minute Euro type mode. Mostly it's a card drafting game, aiming to get sin cards out (and there are seven types / suits) and then on a later turn, play pardon cards in the same suit to cash the sin cards in. Which means you need to be watchful of what pardon cards are being picked up because there's little point playing Gluttony sin cards if another player is going to cash in on them by playing a Gluttony pardon before your next turn. There's a few ways of scoring points which encourages getting both types of cards out - play all 7 types of sins before other people do, or play more pardons in any/each area than other people do. Or be brave and collect event cards and play them for benefit. It's a game of watchfulness but lightness, as the decisions are driven based on the directions that the cards lead you (it's a 3 card draft system), so you don't want to be drawing blindly in trying to force the game to meet the strategy you wanted to take, meaning there's a fair dose of luck along the road. There feels like there are options to explore though, and it's of a length and lightness that encourages exploration. The irony-laced Canterbury Tales' Pardoner theme is an interesting one, and the mechanics match it nicely.

Funny push your luck style game were you tempt pilgrims into committing sins and then sell them fake sin pardons until they die of their sins. You don't always know exactly when the game will take their lives, so it's a careful balance filled with parody at every step.

Gorgeous, insane quality components; including beautiful art work reminiscent of illuminated manuscripts, chubby, tactile cardboard pieces, and linen-feel cards.  A new high in component quality in my collection.  
The game itself is fascinating...it is a fairly simple set collection game where each player is try to corrupt pilgrims and then sell them absolution.  Once seven sins have piled up on one sinner, he dies; then the players swoop in and deliver the last rites for extra points or a crucial extra turn.  It is pure evil...but in a charming way that only a few centuries can create: like the Spanish Inquisition or Genghis Khan. 
The theme doesn't demand you've read the Canterbury Tales, but the game is certainly enhanced by having done so.  My wife, however, who has not read it, was still very fond of this game.  That said, it might not be for everyone, and here's why:
Alf Seegert, in light of this game and the equally excellent Fantastiqa, is quickly becoming one of my favorite designers (although I'm admittedly a little late to the party).  He has a very Wes Anderson aesthetic which deeply appeals to me: his stuff is a bit precious, perhaps a little too clever for its own good, detailed and beautiful beyond description, and absolutely, unreservedly brilliant. His games are events for unashamed gaming hipsters like myself.  I think, years down the road, Seegert will be hailed as a largely-unrecognized genius and although that's a shame, it makes me feel clever and cool that I "get" it.

This is a fun game with a theme that is intended to be very light and non-offensive (even though some might still be offended).  You are a 14th Century pardoner seeking to gain money by pardoning the sins of others - but to help your income you are also tempting people into committing the sins in the first place which you then come along to pardon.  While that might sound like a pretty dark theme, the game plays pretty light as you're really just adding additional sin cards to one of 7 imaginary slots for each pilgrim, and/or pardoning some of these sins before the 7th and final slot has been filled - which unfortunately sees the passing of one of the game's pilgrims.  It's a cross of set collection and area control, but just because it's an easy game to learn to play don't think it's a happy-go-lucky game... it can feel very cutthroat as you take a card someone else needs or you off someone you KNOW the other player was about to pardon for a huge payout.

Wickedly amusing. I can't yet assess the ratio of skill to randomness, but there's definitely plenty to think about, and the game is short enough that is doesn't outstay its welcome. The production value is wonderful, and the sly humor in the rules and cards adds spice.

Quick but fulfilling 3p, a rarity. It has enough complexity (majority in cities/caravan/sin wheel) on top of the simple scoring mechanics and some real game-changer relics that it's worth 30 minutes.

A game with an unexpected theme that works quite well and is quite balanced with 2 players. Very enjoyable to make the pilgrims sin and then sell them indulgences. Great bits, too.

I played a prototype copy of this with Alf about 2 years ago. As far as games go, this is another that will fit alongside those games that don't compare easily to any others. It has some card play, some push your luck, and some overall strategy. Tactics in getting points are clearly aimed at when is the correct timing of playing certain cards before others but not too early. It was a short game, just over an hour. with four players, so with less (new edition is only 2-3) than that it should clock in under the hour. The theme is rather funny, and holds up during play to understand some of the cards and their powers. You don't need to know the Cantebury Tales to play it, but if someone at the table has that knowledge, they will share it to add some more humor to the situation. I'm not sure if the current edition will be exactly like the prototype I played, but I remember the game ending when too many deaths were shown. Overall, I had some fun playing it, but sometimes the theme made me feel a little guilty trying to be the "mischievious little tempter" throughout. Understandably, other games I wouldn't "become" if I had the chance either e.g necromancer in D&D, but I have chosen to play the character there as well. In this game you play the role of a tempter, but I never felt bad for using the game's mechanisms to try to win, since it was only a game.

坎特伯雷簡介
16世紀中期，宗教改革的浪潮席捲歐洲。英國教會也向天主教開火，斷絕了與羅馬教廷的一切關係，改稱英國國教，又叫聖公會。它的首任主教就是坎特伯雷大主教。英王的加冕禮就由他主持。這位大主教還擁有管轄29個主教區的權力。這樣，作為大主教駐地，坎特伯雷就成了英國的宗教首都。
西元597年，傳教士奥古斯丁受教皇委派，從羅馬赴英國傳教。他在40名修士的伴隨下，來到作為撒克遜人肯特王國教城的坎特伯雷。當時國王是個異教徒，但王后原是法蘭克公主，信仰基督教。在王后的幫助下，奥古斯丁在這裡站穩了腳跟，成為第一位坎特伯雷大主教，並把基督教傳播到整個英格蘭。因此，在英格蘭，坎特伯雷被人們形象地比喻為基督教信仰的搖籃。

遊戲簡介（1）
（以下介紹部分來自轉載）
一款配件製作異常精美的作品，MIC。
主題是玩家扮演在這條坎特伯雷之路上兜售贖罪劵的商人，總之就是奸商，然後呢，當有任一名商人到達坎特伯雷之後，遊戲結束，錢多者勝。
哦，對了，這個遊戲裡呢，錢幣的數量是不可見的，因為是放在袋子裡嘛。不過，只要不是擼管擼太多了記憶力超挫的人，記住對手的金錢變化應該是毫無問題的...

遊戲流程很簡單，說明書也比較清楚。
一共有三個放贖罪者的位置，然後呢，公共抽牌區有（SIN），（PARDON）兩種劵，回合結束的時候要補滿手牌的，就可以從這些地方補了。還有一個特殊的牌呢，好像是叫region，總之是功能性的牌，相當於Gosu裡面的卡牌能力吧，只不過是一次性的，用了就沒了。
然後，這個遊戲毫無文字量，如圖所示，袋子旁邊的是玩家提示板，中央的大版圖分別是三個路人位置以及坎特伯雷之路。大版圖的中間地帶可以放置CUBE來表示商人已經告訴路人了他們犯了哪些罪的。
只有在七宗罪每一宗都有CUBE之後，才能在放置過CUBE的罪過上繼續放。
通過使用PARDON來給路人贖罪，就可以盈利。
中央還有一個棕色的人偶是用來教堂目前正在要求寬恕的罪過，如果你寬恕的罪與教堂要求寬恕的罪兩者match的話，就可以得到雙倍的錢。

一個路人如果累積了七宗罪就會死去。
然後給這個路人寬恕次數最多的人，就可以在坎特伯雷之路上放一個自己的CUBE，然後拿錢。
最後坎特伯雷之路被放滿遊戲就結束了。

綜述，遊戲是一個很歡樂的遊戲，因為在SIN牌堆裡有一種特殊的DEATH卡，如果在補牌階段抽到，則對應著DEATH卡和版圖上的路人位置的顏色進行放置，DEATH卡是被當成任一一宗罪的，所以有時候手氣很好，連番出幾張DEATH卡的話，那個路人就算是被你幹掉的，你就可以放一個CUBE到坎特伯雷之路了....
另外，毫無文字量也適合推廣，就是題材獵奇了點...而且中央轉盤的設計挺雞肋的...

I've only played this once and with 2 players, so my opinions could change easily.

I think this will be a game we don't play too often.  There are a lot of other games I simply like more.  The components, board, and box are fantastic.  The concept of the game is also somewhat interesting.  

My main issue is with the mechanics.  Most of the game is fine, but I feel like they tried focusing more on theme than balancing mechanics.  I also hold a strong dislike for the randomness in the relic cards.  Maybe if I left them out I would like them more.  Also, I feel it would be more interesting playing with more than 2 players.

A játék témája nagyon izgalmas partit vetített előre. A Canterbury-be zarándoklók bűnöket és azok bocsánatát kapják a játékosoktól az útjuk során. Érdekes, hogy a játék 2-3 személyes csak. Igazából egy kártyamenedzselős játékról van szó. Vannak bűn és bocsánat kártyák, illetve speciális képességekkel bírok. Ezekből körönként egyet játszik ki a játékos, a három aktuális zarándokhoz és cserébe húz egyet a három pakli valamelyikéből. A bűn és bocsánat kártyákból Ticket to Ride módon hármat mindenki lát. Ha egy zarándokhoz lekerül a hetedik kártya is, lelke elkárhozik és a bocsánatokért kapott kockákat kiértékeljük. Van egy többség a játék közben és a játék végén. A játékban sok újdonság nincs, a kezdő kártyák nagyon sokat számítanak és a szerencse sem elhanyagolható. A többségi döntetlenek eldöntési mechanizmusa is a kezdőt segíti vagy éppen a szerencsést, aki jó lapokkal tud játszani. A játék kinézete teljesen egyedi, hogy régi freskók képeit használta a dizájner. Nekem annyira nem jött be, de mindenképp illik a játék témájához. Maga a játék nem igazán tetszett, sok múlik a szerencsén és semmi extra nincs benne. Egyedül a téma ötlet fogott meg.

This is an area control game that doesn't feel like an area control game.  Unlike Mission: Red Planet and El Grande, there is no map to fight over -- just a road, the pardoner's circle of sin, and three companies of pilgrims.  The implementation and art of theme in this game is really exemplary (and I give the game a full one point bump in rating for that). Also, I always play the game with a house rule that I developed called "The Last Rites Variant."

The Last Rites Variant:  Players may turn in two Last Rights tokens to take an extra turn (instead of just one).  Also, instead of scoring 3 points for each unspent Last Rites token at the end of the game, the player with the most unspent Last Rite tokens at the end of the game gets 15 points, the second most gets 10 and the third place gets 5 points. 


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
1 play, 3er.

Sort of an area-majority game, with a great theme: you're a pardoner traveling with pilgrims; you tempt them with sins, then sell them pardons -- awesome! You can earn money in a variety of ways: spread sin (more quickly you play all 7 sins, the more you earn), pardon sins (the more sinful the better), area majorities (by pardoning).

Game play is easy to learn and certainly works. There is some tension in timing your card play and managing your hand, but none of us loved the game. The coin awards are big and seem overly swingy.

--- Summary ---
SETUP
- Place 3 (3er game) randomly chosen pilgrim tiles on display, each of which has a preferred Sin indicated
- Create a display of 3 Sin cards, 3 Pardon cards, a face down deck of each, and a Relic deck.
- Place the Parson token on a space on the Circle of Sin.
- Players start with 5 Sin cards in hand, and a collection of cubes in their color.

YOUR TURN
1. Play ONE card:
- Relic: do what the text says
- Sin: play to a pilgrim. If it's the first time you've played that Sin, add a cube to the Circle of Sin (once you have a cube on all 7 Sins, you score VP based on how quickly you did so).
- Pardon: play to a pilgrim with matching Sin card(s), and place a cube on that pilgrim. Any Death cards in display are considered to be Sins of the type indicated on the pilgrim tile. Earn coins = square of (the number of matching Sins + 1 if Parson token is on that Sin), up to a maximum of 16.

2. Draw up to the hand limit (5 cards); may choose from any draw deck or card on Display (immediately replenish Display). Any Death cards drawn are immediately placed on the matching pilgrim (color-coded); draw a replacement card.

3. Check for dead pilgrims: pilgrim with 7 Sins dies: you get a Last Rite token. The player(s) with the most cubes on the pilgrim tile (tiebreaker = most Sin cards in hand) move one of those cubes to the next free spot on the Road to Canterbury and earn the coins (2/4/6/8/10) indicated. Discard all the Sin/Death cards, draw a new pilgrim tile, and place the dead pilgrim tile face down; counts as 1 Sin. The game ends after the 5th pilgrim dies.

4. May spend a Last Rite token to take another turn.

FINAL SCORING
- Earn coins for cube majority on Road to Canterbury
- For each pilgrim, earn coins for cube majorities
Most coins wins!

RATING: 5
This game has an amusing theme.  In the game we are medieval pardoners who sell our services of pardoning citizens of the 7 deadly sins for profit.  And to keep business good we also lead those same citizens to sin first.

The game starts with a reasonably simple design then convolutes the hell out of it.  You start with a hand of 5 sin cards that you will play on 3 different citizens.  After you play a card you mark it on a wheel that shows all 7 sins and draw a new sin, pardon, or relic card.  The pardon cards allow you to pardon the citizens and score based on how sinful they have been.  The relic cards do powerful special abilities, I did wonder if they were too powerful to be able to draw them with the same regularity as the other two basic cards.

Where the complexity comes in is with the amount of different things that happen after you play your cards and different ways you spread your influence throughout the game.  Consider that if you fill the sin wheel you score points.  If you have the most influence on a citizen when he dies (a citizen dies after 7 sins, get it?) you score points and place a marker on a spot on the road to Canterbury.  To influence a citizen you have to first pardon him, scoring points based on his sins.  And you also score points based on your position on the road to Canterbury.

That's a lot of balls in the air and it makes it difficult to put value on the different actions you can take.  Also, once this game starts it simply goes around and around the table in clockwise turn order until it ends.  That combined with 1 action per turn can kill a player's options.  A player may not want to place a matching or 6th sin on a citizen for fear that 1 or 2 other players will pardon or kill him before he gets a chance to.  This is another way the relic cards seem too powerful.  They allow players to move game components around or otherwise cheat the rules and then many of them allow you to still take a standard action after that as well.

I don't mind the tension of doing something in a game that may accidentally help your opponent or that your opponents could potentially sabotage for you but it is a constant issue in this game and that turns it from tension to aggravation and even a sense of hopelessness.  You almost play this game making the safest moves waiting to either draw a useful relic card or for an opponent to set you up, neither of which is very interesting.

A decent game but one of those that just doesn't fit our preferred play style.  There is a very significant luck element and amongst equally skilled gamers the win will pretty much come down to luck.  There is control in the game but it is entirely mitigated bytheplayer driven chaos.  In other words by the time the fruition of your plans near, the other two players have very likely foiled them (probably unintentionally) by the time you're back and able to perform your single action.

We only played 3 player games, and perhaps it would seem a bit more controllable with two players, but with luck being introduced by card draw (often preferrable because then your opponents don't know what pardon or sin you have), death cards, and relics, I just can't imagine it coming out over a much more tense game of say Aton.

I didn't even know about the Kickstarter history on this until I came here to look it up after I played it. Even cooler. I was excited to see a game based on Chaucer because I had always wanted to design a game on the tales (pie-in-the-sky ideal) and I was surprised that no one before had taken advantage of such a rich story. 

I enjoyed playing this quick, easy to learn game. It is very clever in translating the story elements into a game with solid strategy. I'm just not sure if the initial delight in the theme and lovely artwork will sustain itself in the long term. Still, I would recommend it highly.

Not sure how often this will get to the table, given the theme, but it's one of my most prized games.  The gameplay is fun and pretty thematic--especially with a couple good, creepy British accents for pardoners to play.

The production value is through the roof.  There's not a part of this game that feels off.  Cards are of high quality.  The wooden pieces are normal, but of high quality.  The artwork is beautiful and thematic.  The card content is funny and, again, thematic.  The little velvet bags in three colors feel great.  The boards are amazing.  It's like fine art just opening the box. Oh, and the box has that solid, chunky quality.

My wife played, and though confused 3/4 of the game, gave it a thumbs up.  Even if she didn't like it, I would keep it.  It's just too beautiful to let go.

Oh, and I teach the Canterbury Tales as well.

RATING: 7
So far I've only played it 3-player, but it plays swiftly and the art turns heads when it is placed on the table. Possibly the most accessible, satirical, historical game in existence.

Once people wrap their heads around the premise, which is hilarious, the game makes sense, but the theme makes for some confused faces at game start. You want people to sin, so that they can pay you to pardon their sins, but if they sin too much, they die, which is bad, but also good. Love the bags too for concealing money, but I also wish there was some other gameplay reason for them.

The DEATH cards are a crucial innovation within the game as it keeps the game moving forward and makes for more interesting decisions when it could easily become abstract and stale. Most of the Relic cards are straight-forward and powerful but one or two have interactions that cause some bonkers combos that aren't fully explained, but are mostly covered in the card clarifications. And I wish the Relics were named after real "ridiculous" relics from history and not obviously made up, because the humor is a bit forced there whereas the game's premise more than makes up for it.

A solid game.

[thing=96792][/thing] is a strategy (mixed with tatical decisions) game about inducing pilgrims to sins and then pardon those sins for a fee - yes, it mixes religion and humor. The main mechanics are area influence and hand management.

I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed [thing=96792][/thing]: I was merely expecting an average game, one with a unique and intersting theme and marvelous art and production (the reasons why I bought the game). But what I saw is an attractive game, filled with options and decisions, with a high level of interaction (with some take that coming from the relic cards), loads of timming concerns and tatical opportunism, with several paths to victory and a set of mechanism woven in a way that everything is connected.

I felt a bit like I did in [thing=72225][/thing], because of the interconnections and of the level of cooperation between players, even without the real will to help: inducing pilgrims to sins usually give the other persons opportunities to get influence over that pilgrim., but, on the other hand, making the pilgrim sin can be worth, at first, points and, in the end, give an edge in the tie-breaker of the scoring.

The mechanism of sins (including the central wheel), of pardons and corruption, alongside the end of the game scorings involving the road to Canterbury and the companies, build a united whole, were opportunities, options and interactions flourish, both between players and the game itself. Is truly a clockwork were no part is useless or apart of the whole.

[thing=96792][/thing] also showed itself as one of those rare area influence (in this case, pilgrim influence) game that works pretty well for 3 players - considering only this mechanic, [thing=1041][/thing] is superior, but [thing=96792][/thing] gives more to do besides corrupting pilgrims. It was, for me, a late discovery, as I had the 4 years, unopened, on my shelf, however it was a meritorious one, as the game offers an environment rich in choices inside a frame filled with details and interconnections, making justice to the Bosch art it uses.

Recommended.

I like the cynicism that the game brings, but I feel like I'm playing the same area majority, VP engine, limited choice Euro that has come out hundreds of times over the past ten years. Proof that theme is not enough to paste over the same mechanics and make them interesting, no matter how much satire you're willing to pour into your cards. The game does have some stuff going for it, namely that, component-wise, it feels like a longer game, but plays very quickly. It'll be over before you realize, and so it occupies a space as a beautiful, lavish filler, a niche which very few other games occupy.

Commented after one game. The game feels quite complex compared to the content and the length. Maybe it gets clearer after couple of games, but at the moment it is hard to say. Not a masterpiece, but might be a good game or not.

One of the few times I've bought a game purely based on theme and artwork.  I love the Canterbury Tales and this looked like a funny little bit of blasphemy.

The game itself is decent.  While it is not an extremely complex game, I think the complexity to depth ratio is a little too high.  There are a lot of moving parts--remembering when to move a cube where, when to move the parson, a zillion different ways to earn VP--but all of it doesn't seem to add up to much more depth than a stupid-simple game like, say, Lost Cities.  I love Lost Cities, but its genius is how much it does with so little.  The Road to Canterbury feels like the opposite of that to me, unfortunately.

That all sounds quite negative, when really, I enjoy this little game.  It really all comes back to the theme though, which provides tons of opportunities for jokes and even a little role playing, rare things for an abstract Euro.  The components are also beautiful.

Love games made for only 3 and this is the greatest theme ever.  Selling salvation to rubes on the way to church.  HA!

An interesting game and it plays well with 2. The components are stellar but after a while the gameplay feels - though rich with theme - pretty mechanical. It will stay in my collection for now because of its unique theme, but it is not a go-to game.

Much more interesting than I would have expected from the rules.  A very tight, tactical game.  Really fits well for 3 players - constant jockeying for position.

Set collection, draft, and trick taking card game peddling temptation and pardons on the road of sin. Fantastically original theme with a deceptive level of depth. I cannot think of another to compare. Bluff and timing are huge while managing agonizing decisions to futher your own scoring pursuits or thwart your opponents. Push your luck element by second guessing your opponent on when to play that pardon! I also love the pilgrim seven card limit element to timing and strategy. And the race to be first to tempt all seven sins...brilliant counter strategy. Strongly prefer three handed. Two player is a bit back and forth.

I have had the great opportunity to play a final production of this game and this is what I have to say...

The game is great. The End.

Really, so far, my favorite game Alf Seegert has done.  I truly love the game.  It is wonderfully, even delectably themed.  The game does not give up it's potential for one more player to possibly sell and extra copy or two.  There is also a well woven amount of interaction in the game too.  Be the best worst good bad person you can before others beat you to it... Fantastic.

I hearald Alf's games because they are clever, enjoyable, employ a balance of simplicity, playability,and interactiveness and are easily accessible to a diverse set of folks.

I flat out love the theme of this game.  Tongue-in-cheek humor is some of my favorite.  

The publisher went all out, didn't hold back one bit as far as pieces are concerned.  It is a beautiful game just as much a work of art as the material the game is based off of.

Playing with two people is ideal over playing with three, but only if you fear a little more chaos and strategy.  I've played this with two and three - I prefer three due to my love for an extra character to share my time with, but really is perfect for two.  It stays balanced for two and three and each time the point differential was close enough to sneer with clenched teeth at the player who beat you by the five points.

When this game makes it to the market I recommend investing in this too... Alf's games just get better and better.  With all the fun and entertaining deck building based games, it is refreshing to play something that is on an entirely different path.  Even if you are simply a fan of the tales or the artwork, it is worth having.  I am pretty picky when it comes to getting games, and this is one I definitely recommend.

The wit involved in this game, I mean... I just love it.  I have a hard time trying to capture it in words... I just chuckle every time I play it... Fattening up a glutton and then stealing all he's worth before you push him over the bend, how can you not enjoy that?

Never got to play this one before it got traded. Watched a play through video again and couldn't see it getting to the table even with its unusual theme.

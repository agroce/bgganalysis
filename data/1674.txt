This was an old favourite. Great at the end of the night to goiive everyone a chance to get revenge on whoever won the main game.
Got it yesterday, and played with my two sons (7&9yrs).

Great fun....though my putting 2 minefield on my youngest did not go down too well....I had no choice because of the judicious use of smokescreens by his brother!

RATING: 6
We acutally turned this into a beer drinking game.  Needless to say, it's great party fun.   It's a card game with a WWII naval theme and great fun.  I'd give it a 9 if the cards had been plastic coated and made to survive countless playing.  Quicker and easier than Enemy in Sight, but not as fun in my opinion.  MAKE SOUND EFFECTS A RULE IN THE GAME!!!  It's too much fun hearing people fire salvos or the ping of sonar.

Lots of randomness (2 big decks of cards), some turns involving no choices at all, lots of bash-the-leader, too long for what it is.  And players are often eliminated from a round and have to sit around until the next round starts.  Rating of 4.5 is based on at least 3 plays, one of which was in late 2007.

RATING: 4
This is not among the best naval battle games out there. The choices presented on a typical turn are few and usually relatively simple, and the play seems highly random, and the fact that the game can go on for another half hour after players get eliminated isn't very fun. The best strategy is simply to take out your opponents ships in order such that you limit your opponent to one size of (hopefully small bore) gun, and then whittle away while they wait for ammunition to come up in the draw.

While this may be the precursor to all naval combat card games, this formula has been implemented better by newer titles.  I've heard this will play better with 6  players, but I haven't tried that yet.

RATING: 4
This one is a little too simple for my liking I would rather play Enemy In Sight with the additional rules about boarding and capturing ships.

NB
I'm becomming aware that abstract games are not my taste and this refects in my opinion of many games).  The theme on many simple games are painted on to level I find difficult.

Games in this grouping:
Taluva
Lost Cities
Bohanza
Jet Set
Junta
Enemy in Sight
Naval War

Some more complex game have a level of abstration that does not meet my expectation for the theme/subject etc.  This makes the game a less compelling experience.

Games in this grouping:
Elder Signs
Reef Encounter
Modern Naval Battles
The Fury of Dracula

My enthusiasm for these games is limited by a level of abstraction that challenges my taste and my rating reflects this.

Jan. 26, 2010 -- It's a simple card game that reminds me a bit of Brawling Battleships (granted, BB came many years later). It's a bit random, but it's a quick game. Not a bad filler. 5/10

RATING: 9
Play a card, sink a ship. Destroyer squadron on the loose. If you get over the fact that this is not a wargame but a card game with a little bit of somewhat valid historical data on the cards, you will enjoy this game as intended. But even as purely a game, the destroyer squadron cards are too strong, so this one ain't quite perfect. We have two copies so there is a backup when deck one wears out.

RATING: 6
Brilliant game - very simple - plays quickly and is a lot of fun. Wore out my first two copies of the game and have purchased a third copy.

What the hell was Avalon hill thinking? I mean the concept was a bit ahead of its time card play wise, but the game play was idiotic. In particular the typically incompatible shells that would get shipped to your fleet was maddening. The only thing that keeps this game from getting a 2 is the whole WWII ships are cool mentality I can not seem to override that process with my brain's logic processing unit. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A very simple and quick card game.  My cards have seen so much use they are starting to fall apart.  Great game for a large group and easy for newbies to pick up.  (But not too large, or you'll be constantly shuffling the discard pile.  Nine people was pushing it.)    Pa-dink!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This game suffers from player elimination and bash the leader.  Playing to 100 points drags on for more than an hour, which is too long for this sort of game.  There is a lot of luck in the cards you draw.  The Destroyers are broken--there are only two in the deck and they can eliminate another player outright in one attack!, and the Mines might be broken as well--whoever has ships in a mine field will be targeted by all other players until they are eliminated or the mines are eliminated.  Okay to play a round or two, but then something else is desirable.

After you read the instructions you can summarize them to a friend in under a minute.  It takes a minute to explain.  About 10 minutes to play.  Mostly luck but I find the game to be good fun.  Cards very similar to the ship cards that were used by the Navy to teach sailors how to identify ships.

This is a very old school beer and pretzels card game.  You have different ships, and you draw different ammo cards trying to shoot up the other guys ships.  The rules explanation is just about that simple.  There are a bunch of other special cards in the deck that do different things and some of the ships can attack via die roll instead of just dropping cards.  

Games like this don't really hold up well with time, and neither does Naval War, but it is fun.  The only annoying thing about the design is when you absolutely can't draw any ammo that you can shoot and you go back and forth drawing and passing, ad nauseum.  

A blast from the past.

I firmly maintain that this game was before its time; it's from Avalon Hill back in the 'seventies, but for once they tried to do a wargame in which scrupulous realism took a backseat to easy learnability, suspense, and gameplay ergonomics. It probably deserves to be regarded as the first modern beer-and-pretzels opus. Its one mechanical flaw is the endgame, during which one has to grind away at the draw deck impotently until one gets a salvo card one can actually use.

Another game I used to own but sadly, had to sell in 2003 when I lost my job, now I want it back again, played a lot when I had it and found it to be very enjoyable, although not very historical, why would a British ship attack an American ship or why would an American ship attack a French ship, these were the types of things that were a bit irksome but not enough to detract from the fun factor.

Beer & Pretzels "take that" card game.  Basically "Enemy in Sight" with a WWII theme. Fun, but suffers from the same capricious card draws as do others of its ilk.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Fun game, although I don't really like having to draw the correct cards to fire my guns.  One can spend turns just sitting there and getting beat on by the other players.

Best with alcohol.  Plays up to nine (!).  Incredibly light weight, and tends to turn into a 'he attacked me last round, I'm taking him down this time' sort of thing.

RATING: 6
Had a lot of fun with this one with a mixed group ranging from ages 9 to 70.  Certainly a bit dated and very random, and it goes on longer than it should, but there's something very satisfying about pulling a submarine card and rolling that 5 or 6 needed to sink the Bismark that's been been pummeling you for the last few turns.

Requires beer, pizza and sound effects. The copy we play with (once a year) has the cards laminated. An essential improvement...

Fun game.  Very simple, easy to teach/learn.  Played a lot of it growing up.  Still enjoy it every time it is played.

Unfortunately, my 'unpunched' copy of this game was sold to me with a very glaring printer error (offset type).  I have yet to find a remedy.

RATING: 7
A classic beer & pretzel game--especially if you provide your own sound effects. Very fun for kids and adults alike. More fun with several players than with just two. Can play any number of ways, for example, taking ships randomly or dividing ships according to Axis or Allies. Played many, many times in the 1980 and early '90s, but of course, no BGG then, so who knows how many plays I have? Another one of those games in which it's more fun if players get into the spirit of it, especially the 'take that!' element.

I've played this dozens of times and I always enjoy it.  This is the sort of game that should come out when you're looking for a lighter game, but Eurosnootiness and Conflictphobia tend to keep it off the table.  Too bad - it's a lot of fun.

RATING: 5
Highly playable card game with a WW2 naval flavour. However, compared to similar titles such as Modern Naval Battles I found it got rather dull after a couple of playings and had very poor longevity.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
The classic friend-killer. If you don't hate someone by the time this is done, you're not doing it right.

Basic game mechanic, a few small logic oddities with the rules but I got some (oddly blue) 'expansion' cards off ebay a few years ago and they add a lot to the game. 

Nothing is as satisfying as wiping out those two carriers that've been sniping your fleet for the past few rounds... With a Destroyer Squadron.

RATING: 7
This is a great warm up, in between or after game.  Sweet and simple, but always fills in the gaps when the boys get together for a solid weekend around the table.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great game with more than two people. However with only two players, the style of play and tactics change completely - for the worst - and it turns much more luck-based. I created a two-player variant (flotilla war), but it still sucks and i can't be bothered working on it but someone else can feel free to!

This one is lots of fun. Great convention pick-up game.

Destroyed by Katrina.

I have a copy again, but it's lousy.

Got a good copy now, too.

Seriously this is not a wargame but a pastime, but heck it is simple straight forward and I can pull this anytime and have a little fun with friends.  Even my wife enjoys it.  Go figure.

That being said, there is little intellectual challenge and this is reflected in the rating.

RATING: 5
Just devoid of any real historical context and not nearly clever enough to make up for it as with the classic 'Euros'.  Simple and significantly random with poaching a ship with the last hit and depleting an opponent's diversity in gun calibers are the predominant tactics.  Destroyer squadrons, minefields, subs, and smoke screens add some additional choices.

Naval War is a rather random and ahistorical but also fun and fast playing card game themed on world war two navies.  My rating is partially based on a significant nostalgia value from having a lot of play in my high school years. [2011-09-03]

This is s fun card game.  Mostly light and fairly luck-based, but still entertaining and with enough decisions to make it feel like you're winning and not just getting lucky. Definitely not for these into serious re-enactments, since you can play ships from all sides at once.

AH version.
Silly cheaply produced 'beer and pretzels' filler that CAN run a little too long for a filler! 

Remove additionalo ship cards and expect to be bashed if you're the leader. Players who get knocked out early will most probably be out for good as they can't get salvos to match their ship.

Other better fillers out there.

Fun and random - the type of game that is a hoot with the right people. Can be overlong. Recommend dropping all Additional Ships cards after first run through unless you want your game to be longer than WWII. Imitated by many other games, including Car Wars Card Game, Modern Naval Battles and the like (although it is fun, not fussy like the games it begat).

Abysmal "game", and I use the term loosely, about attacking other players' fleets. Any balance derives from multiplayer pick-on-the-leader, resulting in a virtually decision-free activity for 3-9 morons. A "beer and pretzels game", sure, except you'll have more fun drinking beer and eating pretzels if you leave the game at home.

RATING: 9
One of the all-time great beer and pretzels games.  Somewhat random, especially when the cards seem to know what sort of ammunition you want and deprive you of it.  Fun to discard ammo that you know someone else would give their eyeteeth for though.  About two-thirds of the way through the game it starts to get a bit tedious--everyone's turn starts to consist of drawing a card, not being able to play anything, and discarding as they search for usable ammo.  It might almost be worth concocting some sort of expansion a la Bang!: High Noon that would act to shorten the endgame a bit.

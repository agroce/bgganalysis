This is a fun game that rewards good hand management and resource allocation. The game is self-tooled for humorous, and sometimes chaotic play. The game construction is particularly brilliant, and using cards for their optimal configuration is key to winning.

The idea of playing as goblins building crazy machines sounds like great fun, but almost nothing about the actual play of the game is.

RATING: 7
A fun card game.  Players construct machines with the ultimate goal of eliminating other players by reducing their respective parts pile to dust.  Has a fair development cycle since the machines' power increases as the game plays on.  Be sure to shuffle the cards well!

The 2pl game I played was interesting.  Maybe a hair long, but it was fun!  The card names and artwork help provide a nice theme.  There's a good amount of player interaction and lots of give and take, but it works well.  Simple contraptions can be upgraded into mean-spirited harshness.

I'd like to see how it plays with 3 or 4pl.  The parts piles would be *much* smaller (120 cards total, I believe), but that would help balance the additional time for the additional players.  Seems like it might work, though, again, I'd like to see it in action.

Note that the rules are a tiny bit unclear in one or two places.  Since the cards define the gameplay, that's not wholly unexpected.  We just had any/all connected upgrades apply to the base contraption at once.  Will have to check if that's how it's supposed to work.

A fun game.  Not a shining beacon of new shininess, but give it a whirl if you like.

Review for second edition.

Very fun if you know what you're getting into. Light enough that it's easy to teach and go quickly, complex enough that even a power gamer can enjoy it. An interesting balance exercise; the more resources you use, the closer you are to losing. Yes, it's random, but it's not rageworthy. It's delightful. Would highly recommend, especially as a husband-wife/boyfriend-girlfriend kind of game. It just makes me happy.

Fun game, but it is definitely a filler or beer and pretzels game.

We had some questions not covered by the rule book, but I have as of yet to check for FAQ or BGG help with the matters. But relaxed group and we all chose the extra destruction for all questions, as it just seemed to fit with the theme to up the chaos factor.  However, a rules lawyer or "have to win" player may spoil the fun.

One play, would play it again, theme helps me mostly on this one.

I own a 2nd edition copy.

RATING: 7
This is a fun game of building a zaney contraption as a Goblin Bodger. Once a turn your contraption powers on and effects your opponents. A game of direct competition where your goal is to deplete your opponent's parts pile.

Be warned, you end up needing a large space for each player(up to 4) because the machines build out horizontally. We have a normal card table that we play on and it's not uncommon to have to overlap cards(which are standard playing card size), especially if you play with 4 people.

One thing I don't really like about this game is the fact that a lot of the cards have the same effect, even if they are worded a bit differently. This can lead to machines having the same card effect multiple times, but with different cards.

We don't break this out often, but it's always a bit of fun when we do! It's easy to teach others. The most difficult thing people have is understanding each card's effect and what you want in your machine.

12/27/2007 - The game can end up pretty lopsided, and there's a whole slew of luck, but I like the concept enough that it earns a good rating in my book. Like all card games with substantial card text, this game will move slow with players unfamiliar with the cards. Speed improves greatly with experience.

5/12/2015 - Dropping this a couple of points due to it not being played at all anymore. I'd still be willing to give it a go, but there are SO many other great games that it's hard to justify playing an average one.

RATING: 3
ugh.. horrid game!  tiny print makes it difficult to read cards with reading glasses or good lighting. Much of the text however is not useful -- the text makes it seem like there are more card types, but really they all play the same in the game (not as many choices available in you hand as you think you have).

This looks to be from the Fluxx school of game design, with just a touch of Munchkin - so if you like those you may well like this too.  On my first play I pretty much ran away with it - my machine dwarfing my opponent's after three or four rounds.  My second was much the same, despite all three opponents trying to stop it.  I'd love to put it down to skill on my part but it was entirely due to the randomness of the cards. Down another mark on second play.

The way the machines are put together is very cool but then you just shoot them at a chosen opponent. Some cards are better than others but there isn't that much variety. There aren't combos that you can put together. If you look like you have the best machine everyone will shoot at you so you end up with a random and uninsipring shootout. It could have been a lot better and lacks all the subtlety of Privateer Press' miniatures games.

An interesting game. I suspect this one will reward more plays as you develop better ways to construct your machine. I've only played this two player so far and it seems like each player having half the deck to burn through could lengthen the game a bit. I'll be interested to play this one with 3 or 4 players. Based on 1 play. Received in Math Trade.

RATING: N/A
First game was abandoned after about an hour when we discovered that one of the contraptions was largely illegal due to that player misunderstanding one of the rules.

OK, first games always take longer, but I can't see how you'd get through a game in 20 minutes as the box indicates.

Update: second game had a new player as well, and I'd only played once, so some learning still. Took over an hour for a 2 player game (not counting the rules explanation at the start).

I won due almost entirely to drawing 5 "kill a terminator" cards while my opponent drew none. That meant I decimated his machine and although he got off to a good start, once I started destroying his machine he had no chance. So luck can really be a game killer in this one.
This would have been less significant with more players, but for a 2 player game perhaps some of those cards should be removed.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is a funny little game with very nice art and an original eough theme. The game play is a bit narrow and the time it takes to read each card for its effects slows it down a lot. It would probably be better as a fast filler but it could only be that if it were played often enough to know the cards well. It is probably not worth playing that much though.

The Good: This was the coolest game box, EVAH!!  The rules are printed on a flap attached to the box, so you never lose them.  AND, the box was made with room for the planned expansion, so it fits right in.  I love it!!


The Bad: This looked like it would be fun, but it ended up being quite boring. Very little replay value. I was hoping that there would be specific parts, and maybe some kind of design element, but it was just cards with wacky, put-together names that didn't do anything.

The Verdict: Traded away rather quickly

Infernal Contraption is one of the most interesting card games I have ever played.  I love the idea of having the parts pile act as "hit points".  Each turn, just playing cards on your own contraption depletes your parts pile, thus reducing your "hit points" so the game is always getting closer to the end.  There are some difficult decisions to make if you have a couple cards in your hand that you want to play immediately since you will burn through your parts pile faster.  Of course, just figuring out how to actually design your crazy contraption presents some difficult decisions.  There is a lot of luck, but there is also a lot of fun.

While it's a decent 'take that' game, there are a few issues with the game that suppress the rating for me:

1. Playing Time. The back of the box says 20-60 minutes. Yeah right. This game is far too long for what it is. I haven't checked yet, but I will look here to see if anyone has any lists for card removal, as some seem more logical to remove than others.

2. The Expansion. First off, it's called "Infernal Contraption 2" leading the unobservant reader to assume it means a sequel, not an expansion. Plus, it completely feels like the game was designed with the sequel already made, but it was pulled out to milk money. The main box even has a slot for the extra cards with the name and picture on it! Srsly - don't be that blatant about it. 

2b. The game seems to play much better with the expansion, so it probably would have rated lower without it. I don't know if that was the best marketing strategy or not...

These two problems (and yes, I admit #2 is more of a personal gripe) don't detract much, but it is a pretty superficial game with a few overpowered cards. Seems that there could have been better cards made, but I don't think anything else will come of the game unless it's redone by another company, and I don't see that happening.

Too much downtime for my taste.  You can plan ahead, but if someone targets you before your turn then your plans will be ruined, which means that it makes more sense to wait until it's your turn to make your plans, which means less that people can do between their turns, and longer turns.

This is a fun little filler game. The object is to force opponents to exhaust the cards in their parts pile while ensuring that you have enough to finish the game. The luck of the draw figures prominently in the outcome, but much of it depends heavily on how creatively the players piece together their machines to do dastardly things to their opponents. The names of the devices are creative and funny, and the drawings are entertaining. I suspect that kids would really like this game.

Nice mechanic in which each player is building their version of the Infernal Contraption of the title and then using it to zap the draw-piles of other players until they run out of cards (this is how you win).   

The theme is fun and the graphics are entertaining.  There is some downtime while players figure out what the cards do and how the various interactions in their machine will screw the other players, but a 2-player game took about an hour.

First played August 22nd, 2007.  This takes a bit to get used to considering that you have read all the cards and get aquainted with them after you go thought the ~5min triaining to learn out to play.  It takes about an hour too or at least did for the four of us.  It has more that it's fair share of luck.  It's a take that game.  I didn't like it at first, however I warmed up to it after a few rounds.  Still I don't see myself asking to play this in the future.  If you know someone who has it and are interested, give it a whirl, however I won't endorse it.

If you can set your machine up to cause the other player to discard to 1 card on each run, they get very frustrated.

Probably suitable for kids and might keep you just barely interested, I think it would be good for maybe ages 6 - 10. 

As an adult I was bored after one turn and luckily got out early as I see from other comments it goes on way too long.  

The decisions are very minimal and much chaos and randomness ensues after. Its a little like Waterworks maybe where you are building a small network of cards only the cards have some powers which usually do bad things to your opponents to slow them down.

This is a good game with just a few issues.  Setup is rough, but not the worst I've seen and your play area tends to sprawl.  make sure to pick a big table for this .

Decent game.  With the game only consisting of cards you may think this is a light filler.  Well the light part is correct, but is not a filler.  You try depleat you opponents parts pile while on their turn they do the same to you.  Is a take that game, if you like that kind of stuff this would fit well.  The main thing I dislike is that there is to much reading of the cards, some cases there is a paragraph on a card telling you what it does and the font is really small.  Larger font, shorter explainations of what the card does and shorten it a bit I would have rated this game a 7 for the concept.

Played with 2 players. It seems like a game that works better with at least 3 people. It dragged a little in the middle as be both had quite a large stack of cards to mill through. However, it had some challenge and I certainly identified mistakes I made and strategies that I'll want to implement next time I play. A neat little card game.

Very amusing game of building machines. Simple, quick and fun to play. I would've liked to have seen more attacking cards though (i.e. stuff that drains other players' Parts Pile), but they might've been saving that for the expansion.

So random, in more than one sense. Bash the perceived leader all the way and then someone wins. I don't like the clashing graphic styles on the cards. Using the term Rube-Goldberg in connection to this game is entirely inappropriate.

I have a feeling the game would have been much more pleasant if it had possessed a cleaner, unified graphic design; if gameplay had been quicker and more intuitive; and if the whole thing had been, well, cleverer. Familiarity presumably helps, but there's no urge to get there. Only played with expansion.

Infernal Contraption is a fun little game but don't fool yourself into thinking it is more than that.  "Luck of the draw" rules this game and nothing you can do during your turn will change the cards you have to work with.  This is not a game of deep strategy.  Your machine will pretty much build itself and your only real choice is whom to attack.

Interestingly enough, a bad hand of cards might be a good thing in this game.  If you can't do much with your machine, the other players may not see you as an immediate threat and attack each other, leaving you to pick up the pieces.

When you are eliminated after only playing 5 cards infernal is possibly the politest term you could use.

Unsure what the sweey spot is - possibly 2 as this would have direct confrontation and your parts stack would not be exhausted and you would have greater chance of getting the blue and brown cards.

Machine building/programming game where you buy modules for your machine and then let it run.  In a weird sort of way, it reminds me a little bit of Labview.  It also reminds me of an old PC game called Omega, in which you were programming tanks. This game has some problems:  It's very luck-based, some of the cards are difficult to figure out, and the box design is terrible.  But, it's cute light fun.

Cool card game about building a machine, then setting it in motion. I love how you can tune your Contraption to wreck other players, steal cards, or maintain itself. Very nice, though susceptible to 'bash the leader'.

Sold 1st ed. and expansion, bought 2nd ed.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not bad, but not thrilling either. Players build a 'contraption,' by playing cards onto the table; contraptions activate from left to right so the order in which cards are placed into the contraption is important. Gnerally speaking contraptions either add to your deck or destroy your opponent's deck. First person out of cards loses. I think this would be better with more than 2 players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Infernal Contraption can be fun if you're in the mood for something unbalanced and swingy. The description of "often-backfiring, nigh-uncontrollable magical machines" is accurate as players build their machines in ways which hurt them a little and (hopefully) hurt their enemies a lot.

In two player, hurting your opponent early can make the game very one-sided and in 3 or 4 player there's usually one clear leader that everyone is trying to take down a peg until someone else is the leader.

This plays like a more chaotic Race for the Galaxy, and is ten million times easier to teach.  "Chaotic" does not necessarily mean "luck-driven," however.  Strategy and tactics are both present, if you think about what your machine is going to do instead of just placing parts because they happen to fit.

Downtime can be a problem.  The cards are loaded with text, and the game can grind to a halt when someone draws cards and has to read and digest the effects.  I would like to see this game reissued with Race for the Galaxy-style icons describing the card effects.  This would speed up gameplay considerably.

So far I have only played this two-player (more times than I've logged here) and have some worries that it may drag with more.

I like it, but it doesn't hit the table very often.  RftG fans looking for something "similar yet different" may want to check it out.

After one two player game, I think this has potential.  I think it will play better with more players.

It's a bit chaotic, but building the machines is entertaining.

UPDATE:  After several plays, the fun of building machines wears off.  That stupid card that evenly redistributes the cards between players needs to be removed.  I understand why it's there, but all it ever does is prolong the inevitable end once one player is dominating.

After several plays, I don't really bring this game out anymore.  The sweet spot is 2 or 3 players, because otherwise one player can get really screwed.  Plus, if you get knocked out early you can sit there for a long time.  Not much strategy at all.

Previous review: This is, in my opinion, probably the epitome of games.  It's fast, strategic, and you get to make a huge friggin machine that does different things!  It easily goes from a 2 player to (possibly) 6+ player game.  There is not really any luck based, and the game play can be offensive or defensive, based on how a person wishes to play.

Infernal contraption is an engine building card game. The objective of the game is to force your opponent(s) to run out of cards in their supply pile before you do. This mechanic is interesting because on your turn you can play one or more cards from your hand, but for each additional card you play after your first you need to scrap (or discard) a different card from your hand. At the end of your turn, you then draw back up from your supply. Each player needs to balance playing cards and reducing supply size against what their contraption will do to deck the other players.

Your machine has what is referred to as a main line and plugs. When you start the machine, you choose a target opponent and then from left to right (and top to bottom, which can be confusing - more on that later) you read the cards and take the actions they describe, targeting the opponent you initially selected. 

There are five types of cards in the game, and each has different rules about where it can be placed. The rules around what card type can go where and which cards need power are tricky. We played incorrectly several times before carefully reading and getting them right. 
Power supply cards have no direct impact on other players when the machine runs, but they allow other cards to run. Power supply cards must be in the main line. 
Blue rimmed cards (components) can be used in the main line or plugs, but must be connected to a power supply in order to work. So if you’ve used a component as a plug, but not into a power supply, it will never do anything. 
Green rimmed (enhancements) enhance components. They can only be used as plugs on components. They have no impact of the component is unpowered.
Brown rimmed cards (consumables) can only be played as plugs into power supplies. They are removed from the game after they trigger.
Red rimmed cards (sabotages) are played on your opponent’s machine, they have some negative impact. They are also removed from the game after they trigger.

As mentioned above, when you start your machine you play from left to right, and at each main line slot, top to bottom. The top to bottom rule is a little unclear. If you have a sabotage card that causes a component attached to it not to trigger plugged into the bottom of a component, playing from top to bottom would cause it to have no impact. We decided to resolve sabotages that impact only the card they are plugged into first.

Infernal contraption involves luck that can’t always be overcome with skill. You can end up in a situation where one player’s machine is huge and cannibalizes player’s other machines very early in the game, therefore becoming unbalanced quite quickly. It is not a game to be taken too seriously and it's generally fun while you’re playing. Infernal Contraption is best with 3-4 players, as the deck gets spread out more and ends more quickly. With two players it can go on a bit long. Additionally in a two player game, some consumables are unplayable. 
It's a decent game for kids. The text on the cards is a bit small and can be difficult to read, so I’d agree with the recommended minimum age of 10. Younger kids will need someone to help read the cards and follow rules that tend to be more complicated than one would expect from a game that, at face value, seems like a light, silly card game.

Seemed like a complicated version of Nuclear War except in NW one never is quite sure what it'll take to put someone out of the game. In IC it is easy to see who is the strongest and who is the weakest, leading to the choice of rapid elimination of the weak or extending the game out to a final multi-weak player crap shoot. And in order to maintain the pace of the game, there isn't even enough time to enjoy what humor there is on the cards.

I hate the text on these cards.  They are busy and too small to read by the point in a long game day that I need a goofy filler game like this.

However, I do like the goofy fillerness aspect of this game.  There is a little more downtime than I'd like and it's entirely possible to do mostly random actions and succeed.  

I played this three play and think that I'd prefer it two player because I feel bad when I have to pick one player to attack over another player.  I hate being an extra jerk to someone.

This actually was pretty fun.  The object of the game is really just a resource management puzzle where cards are your resource and can be used for there face, or as currency but when it come down to it you are racing to not be the one who's deck runs out.  As a two player it runs a bit long but it was just fun building this card building/scraping machine.  I think this could go a little dull after a few plays but the expansion may be the remedy.

Our first game was pretty slow going because we were learning how to play and learning the cards takes a little bit of time, but by the end of it we were getting it down pretty good and it was really fun. I'm excited to play it again because I know that the next game will be even better since we know how it works!

This game has a brilliant idea, but has several factors that ultimately make it fail for me:
1. Luck gives way too much swing for a 45-60 minute game.
2. Kingmaking out the whazoo, and there's no negotiation or trading to even it out.
3. The cards have way too much text and tiny font. Why is this a problem? Because unless you have every card memorize, flipping through your cards and figuring out what each part does is a pain. Plus, after you draw, you must immediately spend the next few minutes going over what you have again.
Sorry, Infernal Contraption. Fantastic idea, I love building the machines, but the game just doesn't work.

This is a clever little game. Direct competition can sometimes scare off newbies, but if you have friends who are willing to try a game and like to trash talk each other, this is a nice gateway game.

I like this game, but it requires a lot of space to build your machines.  Seems to work better with 3 rather than 2 players, but 2 is reasonable.  I think it would improve as you get to know the cards.  If one person knows the game, and others don't, it seems a bit uneven.

While I like the concept and some clever thought and planning can create a devastating machine, this game lacked quite a bit on the execution.  It starts with the cards... the text describing their function is rotated from the normal way you'd hold them, making figuring out what your hand is capable of quite daunting.  It also suffers a bit from the ability to pick on whomever you choose and thus ends up the same as Lunch Money.

This is a very random non-collectible card game.  The theme feels a bit of Factory Fun, but the game play reminds me a bit of a very random Scarab Lords due to the attempt to force your to run out of deck cards and a lot of Maelstrom (a Vortex game).

I don't like card games, and this one is no different.  I have to spend most of my time reading the cards, and all I'm trying to do is screw over my opponents and withstand their barrage.  I'm actually moving this to a 2, now that I've described it.

I grew tired of this game very quickly.  As the machines got longer and longer, turns got longer and longer.  There was nothing to do when it wasn't your turn, so there really wasn't even a reason to pay attention.  Decisions weren't meaningful - just play your cards and draw new ones.

Interesting game, but completely stalled by downtime.
Also, after playing your turn, its not very interesting to watch unless you are the target of another player.

A CCG-like game: you divide the deck amongst the players. Cards are machine parts that you put together to build a machine. On your turn, you add whatever cards you can (first one is free, then must discard a card for each other card played), then operate your machine from left to right (machine is linear, with plugins off the sides; each card does something, generally either give you cards or take cards away from another's draw pile), then draw up to 7 or discard down to 10. If you cannot draw (draw pile exhausted), you lose -- winner is the last player remaining.

The Sabotage expansion adds cards that allow you to mess directly with other players' machines. I've only played the game once, with the expansion.

With all the text to read, our play was (not surprisingly) a bit slow. With repeated play, however, this should play much more quickly -- it's random enough that you shouldn't really need to strategize much. But it's still kind of a fun game!

Played a few two-player games and noted a) the large amount of space required, a minor irritation; b) the hefty luck factor; and c) the too-long-for-what-it-is playtime (two major irritations).

Tried it with three and found it even worse due to additional downtime and unavoidable kingmaking.

Single 2-player game. I enjoyed this a lot more than I expected. Each turn you try and add your hand cards to your contraption to improve its mighty power. You then flick the switch and step through your contraption's many actions. Ultimately, you're trying to make your opponent burn through his draw deck before he does the same to you.

I suspect issues like downtime and ganging up would turn me off 3/4 player games, and I rarely play 2-player games, so I won't be buying this but would happily play (2-player) again.

So, I picked up this game when, on a whim, I walked into the local game store, asked the clerk what game I should buy, and he told me I should get Scrappers. 

It is a really fun game where you try to destroy your opponent's deck (i.e. their machine part pile). Some of the cards are broken, though, and so it can be one sided from the start of the game.

Infernal Contraption is an interesting card game, where you are playing cards as pieces in a machine.  You draw cards from your deck, which is your life, and play one for free.  Each additional card requires a card discard.  Then you run your machine against another player and execute all the machine functions left to right.  The goal is to rip as many cards out of everyone else's deck until they die.

I think the game is a clever concept, and mostly I like it.  There are a lot of cards that you have to learn, so my first play was largely just figuring out what cards do.  One big downside is that the game runs a little long for what it is.  One player's turn in particular took about five minutes. Another player and I joined another group's conversation for a few minutes while we waited.  The game can change so much as cards in your hand can be taken from you or switched, that there's not much point planning ahead on most turns.

Once you know the game and the cards, you can probably bang this game out pretty quick.

I thought my wife would like this more - i had a ball playing it in the store before i bought.  Fluffy, light fun with nice art and theme.

Then i thought the boy (4 at the time) would take to it - he did, but not by the rules.  He still enjoys building a massive contraption, dominoes style.

Only played this once. It's got a longer down time between turns than most filler games, but it is fun to build the contraptions that will defeat your enemy. Lots of cool modules available for your machine. There is some strategy but it is mainly luck-based, and the game will do a lot of back and forth before somebody wins.

Cool card game.  Great artwork, gameplay is simple enough and the instructions are on the box the cards are held in.  Good for 2, 3 or 4 player games.  When playing 3+ games, once the first person is eliminated there isn't much of a chance he'll be waiting for a new game for too long.

Infernal Contraption is the stand-alone card game where goblin mechanics race to assemble nigh-uncontrollable magical machines.
\13\\13\
Through the strategic placement of arcane components like arcantric funnels, chthonic grinders, and entropic processors just to name a few, these crazy goblins risk life and limb to overcome the competition with the ultimate Infernal Contraption.
\13\\13\
Designed by Matt Wilson, the award-winning designer of WARMACHINE and HORDES, Infernal Contraption features the same celebrated fast, intuitive game play found in all Privateer Press games. Illustrated by WARMACHINE and HORDES concept artists Chris Walton and Rob Hawkins, the game's brilliant full-color cards are lavishly designed and feature hilarious goblins racing to complete the construction of their maniacal machines.

Takes a while to get used to the cards and what they do, but this wasn't an issue for us.  The first few games will involve a lot of reading, checking cards, reading, checking cards, etc.  But, still a very fun game.  

Definitely need the Sabotage! expansion to even things out.  I got bashed our first game (without the expansion) when my husband got an excellent start and it was obvious early on that I was toast and there wasn't anything I could do to catch up.

Very fun and balanced.  Great for two although it can run a little long.  Short with four.  Usually a play only gets 2 or 3 turns but lasts in similar time to two players.  We play that you can only target your neighbors with you machine.  Cards take some time getting used to.  Wish it played better with four.

A big hit on the wife & kid scale.  They enjoyed it enough to try a 2nd time even after I won the 1st game.  It's a kind of take that card game. BUT...it is slightly more complex (not alot, but slightly) than just a bigger hammer.  You have to figure out how to beat everyone else down with limited resources.  (other similar games, you can pretty much draw from unlimited resource, with Infernal Contraption if you run out of resources you lose the game)  There are ways to improve your resources, and the combinations of hurting others and helping yourself leads to some fairly entertaining situations.  So it's fun as an occasional game.  Little bit long for filler (depending on how filler is used) and would get old quick with repeated play. But as the occasional play, it's got legs.

This game looked like it would be really good fun, but having read the rules it looks considerably less fun than I'd hoped. In fact the rules make the game sound really dull. We'll play it though and see how it works.  We've played it now and it was better than we'd feared.  The rules and descriptions aren't terribly clear, though... still need to iron them out.

Somewhat convoluted in its execution, yet the card effects aren't actually that different - this game is almost the opposite of what most designers strive for in their designs.

Ideally, I'd want simple rules with plenty of choices and ideas coming from them. This game has funky rules with little variety coming from them.

Don't get me wrong, this isn't a heavy game by any stretch, and it is easy to grasp. I'm simply musing on how backwards its design philosophy feels.

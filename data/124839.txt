RANK: 2180

RATING: 9.75
Quick setup/teardown, durable playmat, quality components (tricked out with highest-quality clay poker chips that I own), simple rules, and exciting gameplay help make this one of the best solo experiences I've encountered in a long time.

RATING: 9
Based on 10+ games.
Very fun and well balanced battle game.
It does not look like much on paper, but the 3 cities are quite different in playing style and there are lots of tactical decisions to make.
Solo game is almost as fun and challenging as PvP.
Highly recommended.

No rating on this game because it did not get played. Nothing wrong with the game really. It is just that my interaction with the publisher ticked me off so much that I had no desire to play their game anymore. If you are curious to do business with this company and have a question about what I mean contact me and I'll let you know what happened.

Home made version based on poker chips (11.5 g), high resulution screen dump PnP stickers and Fa Mel Arena play map from KS 2015. Used in combination with KS version of Rise of Rom and Origins. 
Looks quite good :-) and integegrates well into the commercial elements.

This is everything I've ever wanted in a tactical skirmish game distilled into a simple, quick yet deep format.  After five nail-biting, down-to-the-wire games with a friend in less than three hours, I ordered every expansion.  I could take or leave the gladiator theme, but who cares - the game is beautiful to look and and awesome to play.   This may even "fire" Shadespire, which has been my new go-to game.

I bought Origins for solo, and I like it, but I think this is a fuller experience. The crowd favor mechanic and the bigger arena add just the right extra touch of complexity.

RATING: 6
This is tough one to rate. Out of the box, TLC is about a 6. The mechanisms themselves are great, and there was thought put into all play modes (solo, coop, pvp). The base game of TLC, however, gets stale fast. As a comparison, the base game of Memoir '44 has more replayability for half the price via its game board variability (though it doesn't have solo mode). Once you get the add-on chips for TLC, the system starts to shine. Add in the FaMel playmat and Rise of Rome, and you have a great game with lots of replayability. So, I will split the baby a bit on rating Hoplomachus. I will give the base game of TLC a 6 for the deficiencies of the base game, but Rise of Rome some where around an 8, as more of an overall rating of the system itself. If you plan on only getting one of the Hoplomachus games, you might be disappointed if you choose TLC or Rise of Rome (maybe try Origins instead). If you plan on spending the money to get the entire series, you will have a great, light, solo-able, tactical skirmish game.

Great combat game, quick, fun, lots of tactical choices..with more coming.

Great production values...and couple quirky rules, but more plays/exploration should help this matter out.

Both my buddy and myself had a lot of fun on the first couple of plays, and are looking forward to playing more.

It's an investment, but it's also a lot of fun...I would purchase again given a time machine and a choice!

Finally beat the game. Really enjoy playing this game and with the premium health chips and the alloy dice. Wow. Awesome stuff.
Components are crazy good. The best that I have seen on a board game! I will rate the game after playing it a few times.
Ok, so I played solo and managed to survive the first round, but my champion ended up being wounded, so I had to rethink my tactics. This is a very good game. Easy to learn but with tough and meaningful decisions to be made. This game is certainly a keeper. I enjoyed the game so much that I ordered the premium health chips and the Alloy dice.

The game is fantastic. I enjoy playing co-op with friends or my fiance'. Easy to learn after a few turns go by. Playing the co-op feels like a horde mode in a video game with some nice stradegy involved. 

I wish the chips stored better in the box. A couple times I have opened the box to chips out of place. Since they are color-coded it is pretty easy to organize before and after a play sessions, so only a minor gripe. 

I am excited to see where the games go from here. Developing a unique art style would add to the quality. 

Keep up the great work!!

If you approach this game as an abstract with dice, you'll better appreciate this game. The game really shines as a 2-player game. The solo is fun when played periodically, as you'll eventually feel it becomes a matter of "How long can I avoid rolling a 6 for the A.I.?"

The poker chips give the game a solid tactile feel to the game, and the components are outstanding except for the really cheap dice and undersized chip draw bags.

Received 10/09/2014 w/Premium wound chips. It's gorgeous.

I'm officially hooked - my first time with the game, I spent about 3 hours straight with it, which never happens.  It's not a 3 hour game.  Hell, you can bang out a quick game in probably a half hour if you're playing PvP.

While mechanically simple (basic move and attack, enhanced by unique unit abilities), there's simply a haptic boost when you're moving stacks of 1.5g chips around on the equivalent of a gigantic mousepad.  The built-in balancing mechanic of giving your opponent a reward when you level up before they do is great and really, it plays so quickly, you're not really going to care if there's a giant swing in the game.

While the inactive champions (your big dudes pretty much stand around until they hit their activation requirement) are a little... weird, to say the least... what you can expect is a gamey game that does not shy away from its brutality.  While there are ultimately tactical decisions to make with how you position yourself to make the best of your units' abilities, the short of the game is it's all about killing, killing, killing!

ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?!?!

I have to lower my rating here.  I'm a lot less enthusiastic about the game a year down the road as we recently busted it out and had a few goes at it.  It's still fun, don't get me wrong, but the crowd favor meter just didn't seem to work as well as we thought it would.  There are built-in timing mechanisms to ensure the game ends quickly, but it seems thematically weak that if your city can't field any more chips, your Champion suddenly starts bleeding.  What?  However, as a PvP game, it's still great fun to clink stuff around and see how the dice like you.

The co-op/solo, however, leaves a looooooot to be desired.  We tried it a few times and just can't see any way of actually surviving it.  If you're lucky, you might make it past a boss or two, but surviving all 6 on top of all the little mobs that come out just seems impossible.  Definitely not enjoyable on that front.

Best gladiator game that I've ever played. The components are of excellent quality and look great. The game itself is very easy to learn/teach and plays quickly, once you start to learn the abilities of the characters.

This is a great two player tactics game. Now I really don't like chess much at all, but it does have a little of a chess like feel, as far as the thinking about your plans and moves go, but not overly so. It was just enough to make the game pleasant without considerable down time between the players turns.

Another plus is that the game can be played solo, PvP or Co-op. All of which have a different feel to them to help keep the game fresh for many replays.

I really can't wait to add all of the little goodies and expansions to this game, as they sound like they'll offer even more choices to add to the game to help change up the game for different play types, which will also help keep the game fresh and different for each play.

So what's it all boil down to? If you like or love gladiator games as much as I do, or have been looking for that perfect gladiator game for ages. This is your best bet from all that I've ever played. An absolutely fun and amazing game, that's very balanced with just the right amount of luck added in for those tense and risk taking moments.

Who's this game for? Personally I think this game would be great for everyone. It's light enough for families and younger children and yet deep enough for heavy gamers and strategist. Though some euro gamers who hate luck in games may not enjoy the luck of the draw or the die rolling, but that just adds to the tense planning and fun risk taking moments for me.

Oh and did I mention just how awesome those heavy poker chips feel in your hands when your playing the game?

So much fun. Do yourself a favor and get this game.

I myself don't see the market need for an incredibly light dice-chucker that weighs a million pounds and requires a second mortgage, but perhaps that's just me. 
In all seriousness, the faction differentiation is a little disappointing, and the overall variety in the core set is quite low. I'm also mystified by Chip Theory Games' overall design philosophy, as the chips are frankly less functional than tokens in a variety of ways. Don't get started on the washed-out mousepads, chintzy-looking glass beads, and irregular health markers...

Great game!  Just played with my son at GEN CON 2013 in a 2-on-2 full arena combat and had a great time.

After more plays and watching some games.  This game is broken.  Tactics don't do much, and can clog your prep area if your not drawing gladiators.  Gladiators on the board are what you need to win if your not drawing them tactics will not help, regardless of if they are drawn or if they are given to you from the CF of the other player.

If you're interested in this game for solo play, I highly recommend you view my solo review [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/918582/solo-play-review-a-house-rule-brainstorm]here[/url].

I've also posted an article about potential ideas to make solo play enjoyable and replayable which you can find [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/919926/revising-solo-play-with-new-rules-just-some-idea]here[/url].

Rating solo play only, I was not impressed. No replayability. Last 10 games were the same as the first 10 games. Solo play appears to be an after thought more than anything (no thought into solo scenarios, campaign, story,etc. Solo play is basically 'keep adding more enemies until you lose, or until you get tired of playing'). Missing most aspects that you'd expect in a gladiator game (tactical movement, customization, different attacks, etc). Many mechanics don't make sense (i.e. gaining crowd favor for standing in the middle of the arena rather than by show of strength and style, your champion is 'inactive' in the arena until it is 'hit', archers cannot shoot reliably as far as some gladiators normal movement, 'beasts' don't act like beasts, etc). Severe lack of variety in all areas, including between cities and all the tactics.

Components are 'ok'. Game mat is nice. Poker chips are nice. Artwork is probably nice, but you can't see it (another detractor for the atmosphere of the game). Rulebook needs more clarification and printing isn't very good. Comes with three chip bags that are perfect if you're a 5 year old, otherwise, they're too small to use.

Probably a better 1v1 game if you're in the market for a beer and pretzels gladiator game that doesn't have anything to do with gladiators. This 'dueling poker chips' game is begging for a nice set of house rules to give it some gladiator flavor.


Update: After more consideration, I'm revising my review of solo play of this game from a 3 to a 1.

First, the game comes with a single scenario for solo play only. A scenario has 3 rounds, with each successive round adding one additional creature for the player to fight. That's the sum total of what you get as a solo player of this game in terms of scenarios and replayability. It has been said multiple times from the Comm Mgr. and developers that you are free to create your own scenarios beyond what the rulebook offers, which is fine, but that so little thought was given to an $80 game advertising solo capabilities peeves me more than a little. Yet in an attempt to get at least some value for my money I have more than tried a fair attempt to create my own material, as suggested by the Comm Mgr. and developers. The problem is the original game ships with such limited variety, there is no possible way for a player to create their own scenarios that are anything more than marginally different than the scenario included in the book. The developers know this too, which is why they only included one scenario (they couldn't think of any either), and why there are no additional scenarios for download from the website, even though their rulebook says 'go here for additional scenarios'. You get one group of criminal chips. One group of arena beast chips. Four tactic chips. And six boss chips. If you've played the game more than twice on the default scenario, then you have already encountered all of these several times over making any scenario you did complete yourself more of the same.

In addition to that, and what is infinitely worse, is that given the game functions with printed poker chips representing units, the game is unmoddable by the player. In other words, not only does the game not ship with enough components to 'do it yourself' with what they give you, you cannot customize and create your own units, creatures, tactics, scenarios because you cannot duplicate the components! (as you could for a card game).

All-in-all a MASSIVE let down for anyone looking for a solo gladiator experience on all levels. Solo original game is non existent beyond the first few playthroughs. Ability to 'do it yourself' is non existent given lack of variety in the original game. Ability to create your own user-created content also non existent given you cannot duplicate the components.

Played a demo of this game and had to buy it. Have played it dozens of times since then. My primary experience (and goal in buying it) is as a two-player game to play with my spouse. We've played head-to-head and co-op. It's easy to learn, quick to set up, and a fast play. I like that the head-to-head is not the same every time and is not based entirely on tactics. Some luck is involved in what you draw to start with. The co-op is really challenging, which is nice. (We don't want something we can easily win each time.) I'd definitely recommend this game to someone who wanted a two-player game that goes quickly. Far and away better than other games I've spent the same money on. On top of it being a great game, the guys who made it are awesome.

I was hooked on the game since I saw a playthrough video. (for future reference can I mention whose YouTube video.) 
Amazing Build quality, you can tell the attention to detail. I highly recommend the alloy dice and premium health chips. 
The game has technical depth without bogging down with excessive dice rolls. 
The cities all have common units and a few special units to spice up the difference slightly.
This game is very satisfying to play, and the best part is how flexible the game is.
You can play (pvp) 1v1, 1vb (solo), 2vb and 3vb (cooperative). If you add rise of Rome expansionl, you can 2 v 2 (pvp)

I eventually had to trade this one away. I think the components are very, very good - love the idea of the mat and the tokens are fantastic. I think the theme is very good. I think the game probably plays with some great strategic challenges for two players, but my mistake was getting this hoping to be able to play mostly solo. I don't think there is anything wrong with the solo play rules within the framework of the game, I just think my expectations were too high for how much replay I would get out of it. A little too random with the beast movements and not enough die mitigation to feel like you were able to employ a winning strategy vs. getting lucky. It's a solid game, just not what I was hoping for and that was on me, not a result of false advertisement or over-hype.

For trade but only for the right offer.

Only played solo so far. The game is surprisingly shallow given its looks. Like so many solo games, it basically boils down to a few bad guys coming out trying to kill you while you try to hold out defending as long as you can. Both the bad guys and your soldiers have a bit of strategic variance (special abilities), so maybe there is some room for army building which would make the game more interesting. 

What I do like is that there are some unique (incredibly simple, yet clever) mechanics for the attackers to approach you, which makes the game feel a bit more "organic". And the tactile feel of the chips and the high quality game board are much more satisfying than, say, a card game.

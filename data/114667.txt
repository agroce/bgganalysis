LIKE: tense worker placement. Interesting historical theme.
DISLIKE: some luck in the dice. A couple cards were more powerful than others, resulting in an easy win.

OVERALL: Not bad as a light worker placement. Some event cards were nasty which would obviously skew favor in the game, so the randomness is a little bit of a put-off.

This one scores a 5 for me. It's not that it's a bad game specifically, just there's nothing new. It feels like dominant species without the theme. There was an interesting mechanic but now that I've played it, that's it.

There's a decision about whether to publish your research to the world or keep it secret, that I think interestingly mimics real life research.

Dice in a worker placement is brutal, especially when you only get 3 workers per round.

This is an interesting worker placement game on the subject of researching, experimenting, and publishing the great scientific discoveries.  It is enjoyably clever, and at least when played with 5, which is what we played with, very competitive in terms of trying to figure out exactly where to place your workers. I would say that if you like worker placement games, definitely give this game a try. 

As a first time player, I do wish the upgrade lines on the board had been bolder and clearer; they caused considerable confusion for many of us first time players, which suggests that perhaps we should have learned how to use the intimidating player aide matrices. And short, snaking VP tracks, as this game has, always cause me concern when the board is brushed against, as happened in our game, and sure enough there was debate as to which side of the snaking line, that person's VP marker was.

Not too complex of a worker placement style game.  I like the theme and the idea, as well as the tech tree set-up.  I don't like how the game drags, and it all felt kind of bland.  I really wish there was an opportunity to get more energy as the game went on, or somehow develop your research/experiment/publishing abilities.  Even something minor would help.  Turn order is HUGE in the game, particularly if you want the random event cards that could really help (even though they sometimes aren't any help at all) or if you want to be able to publish anything.  I'd play again - maybe it would be better now that I know what I'm doing.

Gift from Secret Santa 2014. The theme of this game is exactly targeted for me, I love reading about scientific geniuses, their breakthroughs and the history of science. It is a good "worker placement" (energy allocation more precisely) game with quite hard "screw you" cards to be used against opponents. Like playing this occasionally, but not yet sure about replayability. Unfortunatelly my friends are not as enthusiastic about the science theme than I am.

Not a terrible game, but it just didn't grab me.  While I liked the theme, the artwork was a bit drab.

The whole action selection and how the action implementation order was interesting, but it seemed like it was very possible, thru no fault of your own (or maybe it is?) you could kind of get locked out of publishing following everyone else and not be able to really do anything as happened in our game where the last place person only scored half as many as the other 2 people.  

I could be convinced to play it again, but in a world of limited game storage space, this will definitely be traded/sold.

First saw a prototype version of the game at GenCon 2012. The finalized board with the tech trees is fantastic looking, and it fits the theme of the game nicely. For a worker placement game, this puts together a great theme with the competitiveness that my group has come to love from these types of designs. 

Only real complaint is the choice to make your action marker a slightly smaller version of a cube compared to the larger cubes to track progress on the tech tree. But that is a minor gripe. 

This is just what we are coming to expect from CQ Games. Great components, an interesting theme-driven design, and good game play so you can get multiple plays and your money's worth from it.

2012 Interest: High.  Read the rules.  While the game doesn't look particularly innovative and I know nothing about the designer and it has dice, I'm excited about the game.  It reminds me a little of DVE.  You get a certain # of APs that you can spend in a turn or save (+1), However, unlike DVE, you're fighting for the spots to use them (a la worker placement).  There will be jockeying for position to get correspondents and being able to publish (looks like research & experiment are open to all) and trying to get apprentices for as cheap as possible (a la AOEIII).  I probably won't pre-order overseas for it but will be very excited to see it come to the States..

This game seemed utterly simplistic in our first play but  became surprisingly thought-provoking as the board filled up. Keeping track of turn and action order is essential to do well, and trying to predict what other players are going for is a really fun element of the game. So many times I screwed up the order of what would happen and was unable to complete a publication before another player. Lots of fierce, but indirect interaction between players.

Some of the special abilities seem a little too powerful to me, especially those that give +2 on a skill. I also think researching is a little too easy (especially if you have one of the aforementioned bonuses).

The game looks really nice and interesting on the surface, but the game just fell extremely flat. Nothing in the way of really interesting decisions.

I normally don't mind dice rolling, but it just didn't feel like it meshed with the rest of the game here. Also, it seemed like jockeying for turn order was far too important, as it was easy to get locked out of actions you need.

Overall, I think this *could* have been a good game, but needed much more development work before publication.

This game is very close to being very good, but it seems a little underdeveloped. I love the theme and how the game forces competition since you can never just let someone squat on an experiment square since that allows them to research higher techs while no one else can. It's very clever. Plus I like the limited actions and the importance of turn order and timing actions. It's tight and full of angst. 

But there are some problems with the cards. As someone rarely put off by take that type stuff in games, it bothers me here. I think it's the mix that's a problem. There are few take that cards, but they are abnormally powerful. If there were more, it would probably even out and you would have a chance to retaliate. As is its too much luck as to whether you are in the right place in turn order to get one. And there may be too few die rolls to avoid getting screwed by a few failed experiments. 

Not to undersell it too much though since I still liked it and it stands out from the crowd.

A worker placement game that isn't five-player solitaire.  Choices are very constrained; order of actions is critical; there is a great deal of player interaction.  As a result, most of the inter-player "downtime" is used to evaluate what your opponents are up to.  Some players feel the event cards are too chaotic; I see it as a design-for-cause implementation of the realities of scientific competition: look into the not-so-nice Newton vs Leibniz (Leibniz?  Who's he?  Exactly!) controversy as an example.  Overall, a fun, thematic worker placement game that reflects the darker side of research and publication.

Mother of God. This may become the first game I back on Kickstarter. I'd never, ever, ever pass up on a game that includes mathematics in the tech tree and allows me to play as Galileo. Does it let me play as Galileo? I do hope it lets me play as Galileo. I can barely contain my enthusiasm.

It does! Oh boy, this is going to be fun.

Traded for Inca Empire.

Mean worker placement game.  Others in my group liked this, but I was disappointed.  It is a far meaner worker placement game than I expected, and the theme I like, but it is just pasted on.  Never did I feel that I had any advantage/disadvantage or feel I was the scientist I was dealt.  Quite disappointing for what I paid for.  

I will play again, but with 2 other copies in my game group, I saw no need to hold onto it.

The board and cards and theme had me excited to play but the game is awful.  You get locked out constantly with nothing to do with your 3 workers.  You are stuck playing the odds almost every turn and 1 bad die roll shuts down your whole round.

Neat concept, and I quite liked the way the game's mechanics mirrored / implemented the real-world dilemma of whether to publish (and claim credit) or keep one's discoveries a secret in order to further build on them. 

That being said, I don't think I'd play it again - perhaps because some of the thematic types of tension it re-creates so well are ones I'm not as fond of in a game? (Eg: Will this experiment arbitrarily fail?) Or perhaps it wasn't that, but something about the game rubbed me the wrong way.

It also felt dry (not athematic, but dry), and somewhat long - though it was a first play for half of us, and with experienced players the opening game would hopefully become faster.

This game is not for me. There is too much luck involved in rolling the dice to determine whether your experiments work.  I rolled a 1, four turns in a row, which essentially took me out of the game early.  There is also luck in what cards come up and who happens to be first at the time.  Then there is a bit of "pick on the winner" syndrome.

RATING: 8.2
This is not, by all means, an ordinary work placement game, there´s a lot more into it!

The avaliable spots on the board for useful and crucial actions are narrow so, a player can only be really successful if he succeds on exploiting other players placement´s to achieve a kind of "by pass" for what he intends to do (this is very thematic as for, in science, one can use other scientist´s hypotesis or experiment result to publish a theory, for example).
On the other hand, there are here other very fine ideias, like the "trees" of discoveries in different fields (astronomy, mathematics, physics, biology and chemistry) that can mix at certain levels (also very thematic) and the players characters, reproducing real historic scientists, with according habilities.
There is however something that could be improved - the random card events are sometimes too much imbalanced.
Even so, this is a great game!

Based on one play, five players. Interaction works well in this game, with competition to publish making turn order crucial.

This game is a ridiculous amount of fun.  Our group has played it at least 6-7 times now, and it doesn't get old!  The board is beautiful and elegant.  I like the muted pastels and simple yet efficient design.  The theme is such an integral part of the game that it really adds to the play, and to the replayability. Excellent player interaction and the adjustments made to the playable areas of the board make it equally enjoyable with fewer players as it is with the maximum.

I also very much enjoy playing with the modern scientists' expansion - this takes trash talking to a whole new level when you get banter between the "characters." For example, Edison attempts to publish in "Vacuum" and Tesla says, "You would. Next, could you maybe invent something that doesn't suck?"  While others comment on Marie Curie's "healthy glow" and flinch when she threatens to shake their hand after a successful publication.  To me, the fact that the theme is so immersive puts this one over the top for me, I give it a 9.

I might play this again, but my initial thoughts were that it's a 'not quite developed enough' mid-weight euro.  It's essentially an area-majority mechanic, with a lot of dependencies on where you can actually increase your influence.  While the visual presentation is quite good from an artwork standpoint, the functional part of how the dependencies and requirements work was poor.  I'm sure this can be overcome with repeated plays, but it was an issue for me.  The die-rolling is also kind of clunky --there's very little die-rolling, so there's not much chance for things to average out.  The cards are also fairly arbitrary, and make for big swings in a game where 40 points is a lot.

Despite finding fault with some aspects, there are things to like in this game.  The rush to publish actually feels real, as others can catch up relatively easily with any advances you make.  The action selection (some call this worker placement, but the theme is "energy" so I think of it more as actions, is fairly limited but tight --too tight IMO.  Just not enough strategic options to provide tension other than scoring the area majorities.

With a cleaner functional art, streamlining the dependencies, and taking out a little of the randomness, I think I'd like this game a lot more.  As it stands, it's still an ok game, and has a strong scientific-publishing theme.  If light to mid Euro is your sweet spot, I'd recommend you give it a play as it's solidly in that sweet spot.

Great game with a compelling theme: a race against your fellow scientists to publish the most scientific discoveries. This is a worker placement game with each player getting 3 actions (workers) each turn. The board includes a flowchart that determines which discovery can follow which. The game gets very tense about 25% of the way through, and verges on being cutthroat after about the 2/3rds mark. The game is very tightly balanced and every point is hard-fought. This is a nicely designed game with a unique theme, and it's highly recommended.

A bit dry, but definitely better than I expected at first.  There doesn't appear to be a lot of room for variance in strategy, but since there is competitive player interaction and a decent amount of randomness, an ability to mix things up tactically is necessary.  I feel like the die rolling was probably unnecessary for a game with so much player interaction and so few actions per turn.

There's only one path to victory, and that path is blocked by a) very poorly designed event cards that can hose you for no good reason; b) gratuitous dice mechanics that add nothing to the game; c) the near necessity of wasting 1/3 of every turn "resting" because there is no infrastructure buildup.
This could have been good, but some really terrible design and development blunders are glaring.

(10/06/2013) Comment based on one play in a 3-player game.

A Kickstarter game with an interesting theme depicting the struggles and tribulations of famous scientists during the 17th century.

The game is a race for prestige points (VP) with rival scientists fighting to discover and publish the significant scientific findings of that time period. It is essentially a worker-placement game, with a rather detailed action tree similar to Dominant Species. The board has a series of scientific discoveries in the field of mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry, and biology. The early discoveries lead into (and branch off to) other latter discoveries, much like a bunch of boxes in a flowchart. Each discovery has three sequential activities that must be completed (i.e., research, experimenting, and publishing) in order to get the VPs for that discovery, with the latter discoveries subsequently harder to achieve (with more prerequisites), but with progressively more VPs. A scientist could put one of their three "energy" cubes (the worker) into conducting research, experimenting, publishing, gaining influence, or resting, in the action tree. Once all players have allocated their energy, the actions are resolved from left-to-right, top-to-bottom. Since there are a limited number of action spaces, the scientists will have to work their way through each of the discoveries over the course of several turns. Publishing a discovery nets VP, but it then opens up research for the other scientists into the latter discoveries that require this "knowledge".

The core of the game is in the action selection, which requires planning and flexibility, not just because of uncertainties introduced by the other players, but due to random event cards and uncertainty of experimenting. A scientist can "unlock" research into a new discovery by choosing the "research" action, but he/she must have enough research "points" to unlock it. The early discoveries only need one research point to unlock, while the latter ones require three points of research. A research action space will generate one point, while there are +1/-1 research action spaces available as well. The balance can be made up by expending "rest" points and/or by the scientist's inherent research bonus reflected on their player sheet. Once a discovery is researched, a scientist can attempt to "experiment", the uncertainty of which is represented by a 1D6 die roll. The early discoveries have lower/easier thresholds, while the latter ones have progressively higher ones. The die roll can be modified by one of the +1/0/-1 action spaces, as well as the scientist's experimentation bonus. If successful, the knowledge of the discovery is understood and fulfills the prerequisite to the latter discoveries for the scientist alone. At this point, the player must decide to publish for VP, or hold off and selfishly retain the knowledge for sole progress in the next set of discoveries. But, wait too long and another scientist could research, experiment and publish!

The components are quite decent for a Kickstarter game, with wooden blocks, cards on good stock, and thick board. However, the print is small, and the colors are somewhat subdued with light pastels.

The gameplay was rather quick, with little downtime. There was interesting tactical play in the selection of the limited action spaces, and it was intriguing to watch the various discoveries get published (reflected by a player's cube on the discovery), and the tree of knowledge unfold, as the scientists raced towards the most prestigious discoveries, such as Calculus or Laws of Motion. Through seemingly simple mechanics, the game gave the feeling of frustration, as random, but historically-based events unfolded to curtail or halt the progress of science, as well as the frustration that the scientists must have felt, as their experiments went awry. Tension and rivalry was felt, as other scientists were on the heels of others, represented by the cut-throat dynamics of worker placement. Famous scientists of the period are represented, and their respective abilities are differentiated by varying bonuses (+1 to +3) to research, experiment, and publish actions, as well as varying starting amounts of influence on the four tracks: government, religious, enterprise, and science.

However, I had to ask myself, "Is this all that there is to this game?" The answer is unfortunately yes. As someone who enjoys medium-to-heavy weight games, it seemed a bit too cut-and-dried, sequential, random, and sometimes punitive. Although the game seems to faithfully model the progress of science in terms of theme, the game mechanics don't--I don't feel like I am discovering/developing/creating anything; I am simply optimizing my action allocation to get the most VP. Research and Publishing actions is deterministic, while the Experiment action is way too random (with a single die roll against a "to hit" number, although it can be adjusted with "rest" points and scientist bonus). While I can appreciate the designer's intent to capture the theme and keeping the play time within 90 minutes, I didn't get the "feeling", which is admittedly elusive and hard to crystalize in a set of rules and game mechanisms (worker placement doesn't seem to be one of them). IMHO, it suffers from the Kickstarter "syndrome": games that successfully launched because of seemingly intriguing themes, but ultimately need a touch more development and polish that only a "professional" game publisher can bring. I'd like to try it again with four or five players, since the three-player board configuration was too limited and constrained; scalability of the board seemed forced, with the optimum being five players. Regardless, this is not a game I would want to go out and buy. It is a "6".

Update (10/18/2013) 2nd play with 4-players. We've been applying one rule, slightly incorrectly. However, this has a significant change to the "feel" of the game. We were adding rest points [i]after[/i] rolling the experiment die. The rules say you must commit rest points [i]before[/i] rolling the die. This adds tension, and incentivizes researchers who follow in your footsteps. The one point difference in the "to hit" number now makes sense. Also, the action and discovery spaces that are opened up in the 4-player game gives more options and makes for a competitive game. Still, the last turn is anti-climactic, with the first two players grabbing the publish spaces while others scramble for influence points to get the 2 pt bonus. After sitting with this for a week and playing it again, correctly, and with what I feel is the optimum number of players, I'll up it to a "7", with possible room to go up.

Update (08/16/2016): It hasn't hit the table in three years, as the group has moved on. Recalling the last few games, the game essentially boils down to a pissing contest over the rest spaces and the publish spaces. If there were other incentives, this would be a very good game. As said three years ago, the game needs just a touch more development and polish to make it shine. It is a "6"--I'll play it again if it ever hits the table.

One of the things that I like the most about worker placement is that, at least the ones I own and have played, they usually have various paths to victory. This game seems to be simply a race to publish. It might be too light for me. I've only played once though, so we shall see.

Seemed like a fairly unremarkable worker placement game on the first play, but we did miss some significant rules which meant we were pretty much playing a completely different game from what was intended.  This rating will probably increase upon repeated play.  

I do really like the graphic design of the game, and while the board can best be described as "functional," it does convey all the information clearly and the look fits in well with the theme.  There are some questionable components choices though - the player mats are disappointingly flimsy, and the energy cubes and research cubes were so similar in size that people kept mixing them up.

This would be a seven, except for the high kingmaking potential of the event cards. One player was randomly denied a victory because the level 5 technology he was prepared to publish was suddenly worth no points in the last round. So he then took the other event card instead, which was to make someone earn only half VPs, and in so doing, played kingmaker.

What a cool theme. I think I was Isaac Newton in the game I played, that seemed awesome for a bit.

But gameplay seemed mostly about jockeying for the start player marker so that you can choose the dang action that you actually want.

I am shocked to see so many 10, 9s, and 8s for this game.   Granted, I only played it once, but it is just not an interesting game.   Too much luck with random cards and dice.  The player powers are unbalanced, but not in a good way.  I am willing to bet the Isaac Newton wins most of the games given the fact that he is guaranteed to win 2/3 of the experiment rolls.   I am unlikely to ever play again and certainly would not buy.

Game lacks depth and variation. much luck involved on a few crucial rolls.

We also put in, which helped, VP bonus if you published the most math, or chem, or bio, etc.

One character, can't remember which now, far out paced the rest.

Kick starter expansion is silly. Einstein discovering the basics of calculus? I don't think so.

Honestly, all my love for this game comes from the theme.  It is unique and so near and dear to my heart.  I probably would put up with any game mechanic if it let me publish Probability Theory.

Putting my personal feelings aside, I think the theme interacts well with the gameplay.  The feel of sniping someones discovery away with a quick publication is so representative of the atmosphere of academia.

I haven't played too many times, and I'm thinking there won't be a huge amount of replayability.  For the art and theme alone, though, I'm already a fan.

Way too generic worker-euro with a few poor ideas added.

was too long for what it offered - no real build up, just more of the same (but artificially more parts towards the end)

Event cards can be so harsh if they hit you the wrong way. Got yourself in position to publish & got to the front of the turn-order line - yeah! New card - 'Sorry publishing worth nothing this turn'... Cheers, just wasted a turn... Next turn 'You can't publish if you don't get religion'... etc, etc.

If they are not harsh they are just very weak so no one picks them - or so badly worded no one can be sure what they do.

I don't mind the dice roll as i like a bit of chance but you should get something for failing as actions are so limited and a couple of bad rolls can really knock you back.

Just feels like it isn't quite ready & needs a fair amount of polishing.

Played twice, 2p, 5p.  This is a very nice worker placement, area control game, with variable player powers, and some special action cards thrown in.  I really enjoyed the production values and the theme as well, though I could see how they might be VERY dry for some people.  My biggest complaint was that a couple of cards left us with some questions about how they worked exactly.  Also, I don't think 5p is optimal for this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
In short, this is a nasty worker placement game where turn order can be tantamount to success, nastiness is prevalent in blocking important spaces as well as holding back on publishing to jump ahead on the next step in the flow chart which forces others to play inefficiently to force you to push ahead, while keeping game play relatively simple.  This is a brain burner that unfortunately can be turned on the poor roll of a die so randomness can be a huge factor.  Cards can also have a nasty take that effect which can be quite frustrating.  As not all cards are used in a game, one never knows which effects will be revealed.

I saw a copy of this game at my FLGS and decided to take a day or two to think about it.  Two days later I returned having decided to buy it.  All copies were gone.

A year later I'm at BGG.Con and the creator of the game is there selling copies.  Immediate purchase.  We played twice at the Con.  One was a demo by the creator.  The next was in the main hall close enough to the door so we could run back and double check rules with the creator.

Glad I got this game.  I dig the theme for sure and the game play is solid.

I really wanted to like this game as the theme is excellent.  The play left me, well, underwhelmed.  It feels a very standard worker placement game with the added chaos of a random event deck.  The problem is, the game is so finely tuned the events end up being overly-important with very little capability to prepare for or mitigate their effects.  The character cards are beautiful but largely useless, as the little chart on there is very difficult to read, and it is much easier to just look at the board.  This game was crying out for more differentiation between the scientists, more discoveries, a more intricate way to handle research and discovery.  As a scientist myself, I was taken aback by how simple it was to conduct successful experiments, with no wrong directions along the way.  It needs like a deck of research cards, where you can play to gain some bonuses, but still keeping progress slower, maybe gaining a +1 bonus with each failed attempt or something.  I thought I would need to have this, but I was so disappointed, I think I will need to pass on it.

This was a miss for me. I wanted it to be great, as I like the theme, and the semi-innovative use of a tech tree. Unfortunately it comes off rather dry. I'd lump it in the same category as most of the successful kickstarter games: solid mechanics, good production, but no spark.

Played a two player game with John.  I really like the theme, the sense of progression (research to experimentation to publication), and the tree of discoveries.  There's some nice mechanics in the worker placement --- timing is important, and you can trade off early actions for more efficient actions.  I'm so-so on the cards (perhaps too much randomness?), and the entire package is very big.  A smaller board and player sheet would have been nice.

Was fortunate enough to test a very early version of the game and then not see it again until it was finished, which made it feel like Christmas in opening a new game with no idea.  Game has a wonderful design and feel out of the box, very artistic and suitable to the period.
As someone that experienced time in graduate school in the sciences, the race to research and publish new ideas is well captured in the design of the game. The worker placement aspect of the game fits well.
I agree with a couple of the comments about the cube sizes and such, but they really don't detract from the game at all.
Looking forward to showing this to my children as soon as time allows...their love of math & science will fit well with the design.

RATING: 5
Most of the game lends itself to light strategy and planning with nice blocking mechanics.  Randomness comes in play with dice and cards.  The dice fits the theme well, as it symbolizes passing/failing of experiments and the impact on the game is important but scales well to the overall degree of strategy involved.  The cards, on the other hand, invite a level of chaos into the game that far exceeds the lightness in strategy, leaving the game unbalanced from turn to turn to whatever extent the card's effect is.  Also, the cards don't exactly blend into the theme.  Though they add to the replayability of the game, the implementation of the cards was a little heavy handed.

Overall pieces and design are minimal and nice.  The layout of the board could be improved, especially in the action placement, influence, and scoring portions.  Player boards are much larger than necessary and contain a table of information that is the same as what is on the board but that is more difficult to assimilate, thus entirely unnecessary.  

Between the almost-got-it-right mechanics and the almost-got-it-right graphic design, this game definitely carries with it the smell of kickstarter.  Would have benefited with more editing for sure.  Nevertheless, wouldn't turn it down if it hit the table, but I wouldn't be the one to bust it out.

This is a really underrated worker placement game.  It's light medium in weight and can perhaps be a little swingy with the card timing that is different every game, but it's a very unique worker placement and integrates well with the theme.  The dice roll for experiments can be mitigated enough through the placements, too.

RATING: 5
I'd rate this game lower, but I'm boosting it up for effort and for trying something difficult --> modeling historical contingencies in a game. It's not that different than something my students have designed.  For a class, an A.  For the "professional" gaming ecology, quite a bit lower. 

I'm both a scientist and someone who has read quite a bit in the period covered in this game.  Despite the reviews that claim that this game is highly thematic, I did not find it to be so.  Honestly, I would find a "timeline" style game to be equally thematic (to this game) while having a higher educational content.  On the pro side, the tech-tree is well thought out.  However, what is missing is some sense of how science is really done and how particular concepts were worked through in order to produce the tech-tree steps.  Yes, political connections, research, etc. were vitally important.  But the game doesn't thematically capture the process of obtaining political connections.  You place a cube.  The game doesn't thematically capture the process of doing research.  You place a cube.  As far as historical content, the game tries with its "event" cards.  But again, when it comes down to it, it they interact with...placing cubes.  Also, many of the event cards are so vague with their description that they impart zero learning.  "this guy was really important, get +2 to research."  I'm exaggerating there, but only a bit.

Worker placement ain't my favourite beast and here we have worker placement to the core - with your focus alternating between taking advantage of your early-in-turn status, and "wasting" a worker to secure early-in-turn status for the next turn. That's because there's only two spots (for 3-4 player) to earn VPs (off the back of other worker spots done previously), so these go quick-smart. Other spots allow you to do the pre-conditions to earning VP's, thematically being researching and experimenting, the latter of which you'll need to boost with a die roll, which can be game-breaking if you roll poorly more consistently than others given the tightness of the game. There's an event card each turn which can be huge if you're the first player, or really disappointing if you've earned first player and a dud comes over. So although the game is nearly all luckless worker placement, what luck there is in the game seems to disproportionately affect results. The theme is an interesting one - for each item in the tech tree, there's a mini-race to research, experiment successfully and then publish. Only publishing earns the VPs. Each player is a famous name scientist, but there's very little to distinguish one from the other, just tweaking of stats, so once you're into the game proper, the theme very quickly slides away to just checking out what stats you need to get to the next level and then securing them. As in all worker placement, the tension or fun comes in the decision of which of the two equally important and desired spots is most likely to be available until your next placement, and go with the other. But mostly, you only care about one spot each turn, and if you don't get it, secure early-in-turn status to get it next turn. The luck and the inequity in value of the placement spots therefore eroded the rating from the more usual 7 in this genre to a 6, particularly as I felt I'd explored the game after just the one play. I'd still be ok to play as the game works fine; I'm just not sure what the next play would add though.

I like the science theme and the idea is nice, but I had 2 issues with my first play of this game.
The first is that it became a bit too repetitive near the end. The game takes too long for the limited actions you have, to stay interesting till the end. 
The 2nd thing is an unbalanced hapiness-deck. Some cards are obviously more powerfull then others in both ways (to screw an other player or as a benefit for yourself). I had a card by whom I could place an energy cube on a spot already taken by an other player. With only 1 good publish-spot (with 4 players), that card is way too powerfull. The other players didn't have a chance, as I could publish for full points EVERY turn.

Reassurance that my independent publisher Kickstarter-phobia is not all in my mind. The more I think about this game the less I like it and the closer it strays to irredeemable.

Yes. The "happening" cards (basically event cards that may effect everyone or only players that meet certain criteria) are capricious and swingy. They may be lazy design, but this type of event card appears in many games.

Yes. It is run of the mill worker placement. Oh but wait, per the rules this game is different because you are placing "energy" instead of workers. No difference.

Yes. There is only one path to victory (publishing) and everyone is competing within that same space. The players choices become more restricted as the game progresses. Even the rules point this out by saying the game is about "timing". 

Yes. The production and presentation are mediocre at best. Blah but functional graphic design. Medium cubes to represent energy (your workers) and slightly larger cubes of the same color to represent accomplishments within each area of study -- really?

The kicker, however is the asymmetrical player powers. The person who has the highest standard experiment benefit (+3) can more regularly (and easily) mitigate the major luck element in the game (the experiment action --which is determined by a roll of a die) than the other players. Since the experiment action is a prerequisite for the only action that scores in-game VP (publishing), this player has a distinct advantage that can only be balanced by house-ruling/variant of some sort.

Poorly playtested and should be avoided.

Love the theme, the crisp and clar art style, and the flowchart layout of the board.   
That said, the worker placement mechanics need a revision.   If you aren't first or second in turn order you don't get to have one, and the dice add nothing to this game except unpleasantness.

The unfortunate truth is that The New Science does nothing that hundreds of other games haven't done better.  It's just trying to reinvent the worker placement wheel, but ends up doing so poorly.

Nice theme, but even though I think the cards are needed to provide some variance, they can determine victory too much.  In our game a card came up the last round blocking points for Biology.   The one player was poised to have a chance to make the last advance which would have been 10 points.  In a game that scores in the 30s-low 40s that could have eliminated his chances of winning (He was able to squeak in somewhere else for less).  That is just too big of a point swing on a completely random event for my taste.

As the cards can have a big impact on the game, we play with the next turn's cards face up to allow players to plan for any "surprise" that might arise and adjust accordingly.  Decision space narrows down as the game progresses which does tend to speed it up, but also leads to "wasted actions" where one has little to do of value.

Tech tree climbing game where action selection and timing plays a strong role. A bit fiddly with moving energy cubes, track markers, and development cubes all the time or perhaps just feels that way because they are constantly moving and the turns do go rather quickly.  Interesting asymmetry in the scientists, but the only thing that really changes game-to-game are the cards and the die rolls for experiments.  Suspect this is an infrequent game rather than a regular game.

Each player takes the role of a famous scientist in the 1600's or so. The goal is to research new discoveries before the others and to get to the end first.

The mechanics were very nice. You "pre-program" your entire turn, choosing actions one at a time until you each have three. The best slots fill up first, so you get varying levels of success each turn. order is determined on the previous turn through the same "pre-programming" technique.

All in all it is pretty balanced and an enjoyable play. I may not play it all the time, but if it comes on the table I will gladly partake.

It is rare that I dislike a game enough to quit part way through, leaving my fellow players one player short.  Usually I just trudge through the game and simply never play it again.  This one was so painful that I simply couldn't put up with it.  Do some stuff, have someone else complete it before you: get nothing.  Try again elsewhere - oh wait, I need to schmooze more with the Pope before I can do that.  By the time I'm ready, that's gone.  Rinse and repeat. OR ... I could play for the endgame!  Ignore all the early projects and just go talk up the governments, the religious leaders, the craftsmen and the magnifying glass manufacturers.

Played 3-player and 5-player, and mostly enjoyed both sessions though things became somewhat tedious and boring. Cards provide some variety and effect. 

Requiring a die roll for Experiments is perfectly applied (with luck mitigation possible via Rest, or the +1 DRM or reroll action, or by having a certain beneficial card in your Lab). A plus here is how quickly it plays. 

Initial take is that The New Science is too many steps short of being something worthwhile, however. It feels too disjointed and with forced mechanics. It's too dry and not compelling enough, so hasn't hit our table again (in other words, a typical KS release that's a valiant failure).

I love the theme, and wanted to love the game, but it just wasn't working.  Our group bagged the game midway through the first play.  Looking at the "happening" cards coming up it looks like the game would have bogged down and gotten backstabby, which would have just made the game worse.

One of the most cutthroat worker placement games I have ever played. I feel like the cards are a bit unbalanced though. They seem to have a tendency to fall squarely under "too-situational" and "way too nice" with little middle ground, though the KEEP mechanic helps a bit with this. Haven't had a chance to play with 4+ players yet, but I think it would be great fun.

This is a solid worker placement game, which I like more than most other worker placement games that I've played. However, the die rolling is a turn-off, as in the game I played, ones were constantly being rolled. Still a good game, but I'm not convinced that it's worth $50.

Maybe it's just the one card. This warrants investigating.

I cannot think of a game I've played in the last few years that is less interesting and less enjoyable. I'll say it, elephant in the room and all that: broken.

The cards are absurd-- king-making, unpredictable, hugely variable and joyless. Many reduce the number of interesting choices from negligible to non-existent. (Oh, hey player 3 and 4: no scoring for you this round, so your 3 worker placement actions are now even more constrained and useless, whee!)

The game is *extremely* scripted and many turns (especially the last round) there is no meaningful decision to make. You are reduced to a monkey taking the only quasi-reasonable option... again and again and again (insert monkey squawking sound here).

The (chutes-and-Ladders-level) randomness in the endless dice rolling is the worst sort of luck: game-breaking. Multiple bad rolls get no compensation, they just knock you out and make the game tedious. And, rubbing the salt in, the asymmetrical player start powers are completely unbalanced.

This game is the poster-child for what is wrong with kickstarter. In one of the threads here on BGG the designer chimes in, "...There are two parts of the rules that I personally would like to house rule in retrospect..." OMFG. This is the designer's comment? Yes. (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1021919/i-like-what-is-happening-here-but) The designer is talking house ruling the meat of the game in the BGG forums?!?! Seriously?!?! That is pretty much the definition of something that wasn't play tested enough prior to being rushed out the door for the crowd-funding suckers.

And here, again, the designer's own words, (from this thread, http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/936639/was-i-the-only-person-underwhelmed-by-the-base-mec) should be fair warning to anyone contemplating two+ hours of your precious game day on this turd: "I'm sorry you do not like the game. All of the decisions you are critical of were intentional: 1. The simplicity (which bleeds into the "sameness") is intended to let the game play in 1-2 periods of a science class, and be easy-to-learn and digest for high school students." There you have it, the actual design intention, from the designer himself. So, if a double period high school class spent playing an "educational" game (that only has bare-bones thematic connection to science via mini-biographies of famous scientists on your player mat) is your idea of fun: yee-haw. For the rest of us: skip the trip in the way-back machine to that tedium called "high school", and spend your time playing real games-- you know, ones designed for gamers and actually play tested properly.

Not exceptional mechanically, but the theme is cool, even if it's pasted on.  The base of this is a worker placement Euro, but with a quite interesting timing engine glued on top of it, one in which there is a cycle you must go through, and varying bottlenecks that keep you from getting through that cycle.  The cycle is tight enough that there's a real reason to keep an eye on your competitors, and try to time stuff to your advantage.  There's even a little spice of player interaction to keep the whole affair from getting stale.  The game shows its Kickstarter-y nature with beautiful art and fantastic components, though it does have a tinge of awkward design in the small black flecks that look like crud on the board even though they're printed on, and a snaking score track that is very difficult to read.  Still, there's no other game that I know of on this theme, and there's something that's just cool about saying "I'm going to go discover calculus now."  Okay, well, it's cool [i]to me[/i].

Euro-type cube worker placement game with GREAT theme, most realistic game of science I've seen, much less played, as a scientist. Without theme, or me being a scientist, maybe a 6.

2 plays in, one with two players, one with 4.  Love the art and theme.  Mechanically it is very similar to Dominant Species, but not as complex.  four players definitely livened things up and made it more cut throat.  Game play was quick, and easy to pick up on.  Ending seemed a little anti-climatic, but not too much.  We enjoy this a lot, and can see this one getting played many more times.

What a disappointment. Turns out the game is just a race for points with +1 for this and -1 for that.

I'm the developer of The New Science so my rating is of course totally biased. However, truth is, TNS scratches a specific worker placement/cutthroat itch with a terribly unique theme and plays in under 2 hours. 

I genuinely like it a lot.I hope you do too!

Medium weight Euro style game with nice components and an interesting theme.  Some cards can defeat your planning when they come up which add an element of luck to the game some may not like.  Dice rolling to meet requirements is another luck element that can be mitigated by use of "rest" points but still more luck for the unlucky to dislike.

A completely serviceable worker placement game that would have been rated higher 5 years ago.  But, now, just ok.

My biggest gripe is that there is a huge impact of turn order due to the limitations on publishing.  This causes what feel to be very scripted turns.  (This turn I rest so I can go first, next turn I publish, rinse and repeat)

Medium-light worker placement game that is based on historical scientists competing to discover and publish new scientific theories.  Good looking board, but could have used a little more care in production.  It is quite fragile, so be careful.  Components could have included 1 more different shape rather than 2 different sized cubes, but not a big issue at all.

I love the stats the scientists receive.  They are based on history as much as mathematical fairness in the game would allow.

Being an actual scientist by trade, when my friends asked me to play this game in which the goal is to research, experiment and publish before you get scooped,  I broke out in a sweat and wanted to run the other way screaming.
The panic-inducing theme notwithstanding, I was pleased that I enjoyed the game as much as I did. 

It is your basic worker placement and time management game. The board is absolutely gorgeous.  It runs a little bit long, so I would have been happy if we cut off at least one tier of publishing. My biggest gripe with the game is the event cards, which add too much randomness to the game. I don't mind some randomness, but when you have played strategically and skillfully the entire game, you shouldn't be able to be taken down so dramatically just from the flip of a card.

September 1, 2012:  I've just skimmed the near final version of the rules and it looks like there are some substantial changes that address some of the concerns that I expressed below after my play on a prototype.  I look forward to giving it another try.

June 14, 2012:  One partial four-player game, first play for all but one. Version 0.2 rules with (excellent) playtest components. We made it to the point where players were just starting to discover the level 5 techs when we called it a night. It looked like the game would be going on for another hour or two (for a total in the five hour range) before we got to a finish.

When the game started, I was quite enthusiastic. The mechanics and theme seemed to fit very well together. I became less enchanted as the game went on because the techs became challenging faster than the scientists improved. Assistants only partially mitigated that, so it seemed like the only way to research, discover, and publish the later techs was to spend whole turns or more Resting. While that might realistically model the difficulty of discovering those higher techs, it didn't look like it would be very fun to play it out. We also never saw a reason to take the Collaborate action to trade cards or discoveries with other players.

Overall, I think that the game needs to be shortened and the end game accelerated. That will maintain player interest as the game moves to its climax. It's probably the case that the game would play faster with more experience, but it didn't seem like we were dragging. Also, the game looks like its length would scale linearly with the number of players. That could be bad.

So, overall, I love the theme, and the mechanics all make sense, but something needs to be done to keep the gameplay from becoming tedious as the techs' difficulty increases at the higher levels. Late game assistants may need to be buffed, but that might make scientists who can use more assistants than others too strong. The Collaborate action needs to be tweaked or dropped. Board is both functional and beautiful.

This game deserves WAY more love.  It is a great worker / action placement game with some mechanics similar to Dominant Species.  It has a tech tree, is effortlessly thematic and really tense and exciting.  I think if this somehow had a Zombie, Medieval, or Space theme, this would be rated at 7+.  Doing science experiments just isn't sexy and it's a shame... because everyone is missing out.

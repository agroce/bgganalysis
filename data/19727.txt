Played a custom "totally-not-Star-Wars" board with Zipse at a convention, but not sure about this one.  The cards frustrated me, but I can't really tell if that's by design or not.  I'd need to play again to be sure, but have no desire to play again.  Interesting.

An enjoyable way to spend a few hours, although any "race/fight" game should have more ways for trailers to hurt leaders than vice-versa. Lots of mines, not enough other weapons.

Robo-Rally in space without the unfunness and boringness.  Better played with more people, but still fun with 3!  I liked it!  TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE production values.  They spent their money in the wrong places and not in the right ones.  For almost $60 there should be better components, so that is going to drop this a whole point because of that, could be a 7, but ugly artwork and crappy quality cards.

RATING: 7
A fun SF race game, sort of a RoboRally/Space Balls mashup. The first lap is a little boring, since most weapons are emplaced (like mines), and thus easy to avoid. By the third lap, you're hoping to get lucky and avoid the 2 space mines, because the asteroid and that black hole are really cramping your options... Great con game.

RATING: 2
A miserable experience.  After 3 hours, I dove into a black hole to end it all.  Way too long for what it is - a simple race.  Draw your cards, play a few events to screw others, then optimize your movement.  Speed is always good, and you should always use as much movement as possible.  Shields regenerate fast enough that there is little incentive to avoid mines - which means there is also little point in playing them.  So, very little in the way of decisions to be made, just take your cards and move toward the finish line.  For 3 hours.  I will not play this again.

Difficult to pin down whether I like this one or not...first of all, hats off to the designer both for doing a space game and also for practically ignoring almost everything that Eurogames have polluted the hobby with since the mid-90s.  This is very much an old-fashioned, American-style game complete with randomness, nastiness, player elimination, shoddy components, and rich theme.  So yeah, some good and bad in there I guess.  Gameplay is a somewhat clunky (but endearing) cross between the movement process of Starfleet Battles (yeah, I went there) with the concept of greater speeds allowing movement in more sub-pulses (I _really_ went there), the programmed, sequential cardplay of Nuclear War, and a race game like F-Zero.  So all that adds up to "pretty damn good", right?  Not quite, at least after my first play.  Most of the special abilities and many of the events wound up as arbitrary distractions to a pretty solid race mechanic and every turn seemed to present some kind of new rules issue- aided in part by several misprints and contradictions that once ironed out aren't so bad, but really guys...look over the files before you send them to the printer.  Movement is almost harrowingly tricky at first, but when we realized how hardy the ships were we wound up almost playing movement cards at random with decent results.  The components are poor compared to the super expensive, MIchael Bay-style productions of FFG or Eagle but having grown up playing games with chits you had to cut out and photocopied manuals, they're not so bad to me and considering Kenzer hit the $50 price point with a game that's got so many components (and a big, mounted board) I won't b!#ch too much.  I don't want to hurt the designer's feelings, but the art is very  poor and actually hurts the game's appeal- I brought it out and no one wanted to play it based on the silly, crude artwork.  I definitely dig the humourous, light vibe that he went for but seeing this game on the shelf next to other current games makes it look cheap and not worth $50 in gaming money.  In sum, I think there's potential here and it's definitely worth a look if your group enjoys beating the crap out of each other and lots of bad language-  just don't come expecting fairness or an "everybody wins" mentality and understand that it's a very independent, idiosyncratic production that isn't even trying to appeal to the Caylus crowd.  I do hope the rating goes up as I play more, because I _want_ to like it more than I do at first blush.   Oh, and my group had absolutely no problem remembering who was what colour.

The most interesting turn of the one time I played this was when my ship blew up.  This game tries to be too much -- the chaos of RoboRally with the length of Formula De and the fidgetiness of Betrayal at House on the Hill or Civilization -- and gets lost in itself.  Maybe it would be better if you only run two laps.

RATING: 2
This is supposed to be a fun simulation of racing your ships through three laps across an obstacle-filled galaxy board. Great in concept, terrible in execution. There's a high degree of randomness involved, which isn't bad by itself. But the only way to move your ship is to play cards from your hand with pre-determined move sequences. This means that you'll often be stuck in front of an asteroid or other space obstacle with no way to avoid taking damage. In addition, not all of the cards allow you to determine which way your ship is facing on its hex, which leads to even more frustration. Couple this with a 2-3 hour playing time and flimsy components and you have a pretty atrocious game on your hands. Completely unfun.

I ran this game as a demo for attendees at Origins Game Fair for many years and it is the game that got me back into board gaming after a many years absence.  The turns can get a little complicated but it is still a heck of a lot of fun, especially when the collisions and pile-ups start in the third lap.

RATING: N/A
Man, the box is heavy and on par with the Comands & Colors: Ancient box.  The board is mounted like the old Avalon Hill boards, but the cards SUCK HARD!!!!!!!!!!!  I almost returned the game after looking at them.  They are more like heavy glossy paper than card stock, there are close to 200 of them and the stack is around 1 or 1-1/2" tall.  They look like they were printed on an ink jet printer and cut out, square corners and all. A couple of my cards were off-cut, but not too bad, if the cards weren't lousy, I probably wouldn't have cared. Several of the square cut corners were damaged due to the fact that they were rubber banded (argh!) rather than plastic wrapped. A guy at the FLGS where I bought this commented that he would rather have an unmounted board and decent cards rather than the other way around. The game is $50! I seriously considered scanning the cards and reprinting them out on card stock, I ended up sleeving them (now that mini sleeves are available). The cards were thin enough that occasionally two stuck together and I couldn't tell until I counted the sleeved cards and came up short. The rest of the components are great except for the cheap plastic dice (better than C&C:Ancients) although I have heard that the board warps.

$50!!!!!!!!!

Rant off.
The game looks fun though.

P.S. This was posted before games were expensive, $50 seems ok for a poorly made game now.

The Great Space Race borrows heavily from Robo Rally, but is more forgiving and somewhat easier to play.  It offers players a chance to hinder their opponents’ efforts, as well as manage their movement and ship’s features. The excitement level of a particular game, however, is largely determined by the number of events and obstacles that surface.  If there are too few, the game can be a bit dull.  If they surface liberally, the game can be quite chaotic and fun.

RATING: 8
Somewhat pricey, but that's ok since K&C aren't able to mass-produce like WotC and others. Some goofy errors throughout the rulebook and/or game board, but with the FAQ things are cleared up. Could use a rules re-write (PDF) that is downloadable here on the 'Geek.

RATING: 7
If you combine two parts Roborally, one part Mario Kart, you'll end up with The Great Space Race.  It's a chaotic, cutthroat game of screwing over your opponents while avoilding nuclear mines, black-holes, and giant shield-sucking space amoebas.  The components aren't the best and it may run a little long for what it is (lots of fiddliness and randomness) but the game gets where it wants to be - a fun romp in space with plenty of laugh-out-loud moments.  I only wish there were more projectile weapons instead of mines to cut away at the leader instead of screwing over the trailing.

RATING: 9
First impression after one play with two players - two ships each.  Lots of fun if you enjoy games like Robo Rally. Lots of chaos, lots of laughs (too long and chaotic for the Eurogame crowd).  You may not be in total control, and there's certainly the luck of the draw, but you can't just play the movement cards at random if you expect to win the race.  Mines can make a difference.  If I would have hit one on the last lap of my race my ship would have most certainly exploded and I wouldn't have won. For all of the chaos, the race was still extemely close and exciting.  Lots of replayability as there's plenty of weapons & events to change things up.

I wish the card quality was better - they are extremely thin, and they get handled a lot.  The board (fairly heavy), counters and player mats are good quality.

2nd impression with six players - about the same as the first.  Everyone enjoyed it very much, but we decided to only play two laps.  Three laps might have taken a bit too long, plus people were getting knocked-out on the second lap.  Lots of laughs.  Mines and damage from ramming ships does make a big difference.  We played with a sand timer that was turned-over once at least four people had programmed their moves.  This speeds-up the game significantly and keeps things moving.

Now THIS is the game I've been waiting for. Damn good fun. Reminds me of Formula De with some elements of Nuclear War and Robo Rally tossed in. As soon as I moved my ship the first time I knew this game was something special. One of the few games we've played in recent months that everyone wanted to play again as soon as we had finished. This one won't be gathering any dust. That's for sure. Kenzer give us those expansion sets I've heard rumors about. This game just screams out for additional tracks, new ships and all kinds of crunchy new rules. Nicely designed. One heavy game. There's a lot crammed in the box considering the price. Did Tom Wham do the art on this game?

RATING: 5
Could be fun, but some of the cards and components were missing from the box when I purchased it new. The publisher website suggested printing out the missing components, which I did, but the whole process just put me off wanting to play. Played it with my son once. Also the component quality wasn't there.

It IS a bit like Mario cart in space and that's the charm of the game. And the first few times you play it's a real blast but it's a bit long for this type of game and I gotta admit the last time we played I was really wishing we were playing something else. I think It's a great game in small doses.

RATING: 8
A wacky space race with each player a different alien. Players pre-plot movement.

The Good: An absolutely gorgeous board. And it is HUGE. A big part of this games appeal is the wacky things that can happen. If you like wacky sci-fi games, you will like this one(with a few house rules). Can shorten the game by playing fewer laps. Cool wackiness like wormholes, amoeba clouds and acid clouds can help/hinder the players.

The Bad: Fortunately, some house rules can help ease the bad. The First lap is Tooooooo Slowwwwwww. Players start at speed 1 and can only speed up 1 per turn - that is five full turns before you get to max speed ! Easily remedied though - start out at speed 4 or 5. Also, you have to lose a full movement to buy equipment - so none get bought. Next time I will play with every player starting with 2 equipment cards. Obstacles get played to the track as you race - so most likely the players will have a very boring first lap. Next Time I plan to randomly place the amoeba cloud and acid cloud before starting.

The Ugly: The cards are the thinest of the thin, with square corners. These cards are perfect for easy folding, crumpling and  mutilating.

Outstanding fun and play.  We have come up with several varients to keep the action fun.  The best is flying 3 ships in one direction and the other 3 ships in the other direction.  Now you have to navigate on coming ships.  With a new custom board we are always playing a new track.  No matter how often we play its a 3 hour game, but we accept that, being that we find we are having fun playing it.  It does suck if oyu get knocked out early, we tend to leave that for the last round.  With a few newly designed major events and a New event card, we have modified the game to make it more dangerous and fun.

Card quality is what it is, but we deal with it and don't worry about it.  You actually have almost at all time alot of navigational control.  It just gets messy when you have ships racing in the opposite direction!  We often race 3 going one way and 3 going the opposite.

(reminded me of the cheapass type crappy cards) Here's to hoping the cards stand up to the punishment.

Pretty cool sci-fi race game. Rather chaotic. Has some teething problems with the rule book and components. Board is too large for convenient play.

RATING: 5
The Great Space Race is a fun game that combines car wars and robo rally in a clever space setting.  I enjoy games in which the players plot out their moves before the turn starts, and GSR does a good job of this.  It also has a funny setting with a good theme, and it turns out to be a wild and wacky game.  Like Robo Rally, I think its more fun if you let the players start with equipment upgrades when starting, as they are a little hard to get in the game.

My main complaint with GSR is its length.  The full 3-lap game can take quite a long time, but without the full 3 laps, the mines don't become too much of an obstacle.  Like other race games, it can suffer from a runaway leader or a player that falls too far behind.  There is also a lot of randomness with the events and the like.  If you can get past this, and you can lose yourself in the theme, you'll have a lot of fun with this game.  But if you're looking for a purely strategic and balanced game, I suggest looking elsewhere.

8-19 Picked up at Zombie Planet in Albany, NY. After one play, has attributes of RobboRally but it's faster and has some features that I like better. I like the fact that the terrain becomes modified by the players efforts, and becomes progressively more dangerous as you move around the track. Players also become more dangerous, as the upgrades steadily make their way into the game. Commponents are typically American-quality (i.e. cheap). Misprint on board is unfortunate, and manual passable. I enjoy the game art, reminds me of Tom Wham's Awful Green Things. I like the theme AND enjoy racing games, so I will play this one occasionaly with the right group. /// 3/13: Sold.

2014: This game was Mario Kart in a board game. That's not a bad thing. I'd play it again if someone asked, and I was somewhere where there were fewer other choices available. That's not a knock on the game.

Entertaining yet shitty.

The designer/published must have sunk a lot of money into this one.

This game could have been drastically better if the rules were more streamlined. For example, why bother rolling to see if you'll sustain damage if you hit a mine/asteroid/ship for damage? You should simply take the damage!

Still, I'd rather play this than RoboRally.

A lot like Robo-Rally; you plan your moves based on cards you get, in order to complete three laps around a race track in space while placing obstacles to hinder opponents and avoiding obstacles they placed to hinder you. It was fun, but has the flaw of many games, in hindering your range of choices based on the few cards you get (although it corrects that flaw to a much greater extent than Robo-Rally). I wouldn't mind playing it again, but it's not on my must-play list.

The game: a 3-lap race around the track (hex map). The track is initially empty, but fills up as event cards are drawn. For us, that didn't happen till the leader was halfway around the track. So it was a simple race. Movement is like in Bumper Car arena: cards show various patterns of movement based on your ship's current orientation. The faster your speed, the more cards you play and draw. Movement is programmed like RoboRally, but to model variable speeds the cards are laid out like Star Fleet Battles with 5 "impulses" so that ships at speed 5 play a card in every slot, speed 3--> slots 1, 3, 5, speed 2--> slots 2, 4, etc. Events occur randomly when you draw replacement cards (you do the event, max 2/player/round, then draw replacement cards). There are also equipment cards scattered in the deck, that modify your ship's function.

1 play, 1-lap game, when I was very tired. I think I'd like it more if I was fresher, and if we seeded the board with a few obstacles before starting. Also, probably stick with a 1- or 2-lap race.

The game is easy to learn and has alot of options. Trying to survive till the end is the main objective of the game.

This game takes much too long for a game with so much chaotic insanity.  The art sucks, the components are crappy, and the manual was written poorly.  Still, it could have been worse, and I had fun for the first hour.  I can see why people compare this to Mario Kart, though this game is sort of like stretching a five minute Mario Kart race into 2 and 1/2 hours.

I was really hopeful for this more copmlex-looking RoboRally-style game, and I did enjoy it, but I think that it requires more players to get to the "Fun" threshhold than does RoboRally, and it just didn't click as tightly.  We liked it, but figure it won't ever beat RoboRally to the table.

For the most part I don't enjoy racing based games and don't have many good things to say about RoboRally.  I did get the chance to play this one however through a fellow geek (KerPow) and I came out enjoying it more than I thought I would.  I would still prefer a good Euro, however at this point I would rank this one at the top of my "racing game" list.  Plenty of chaos and mayhem but you feel like you have enough control over your ship to not be as chaotic.

Played with only two. I'm assuming it'll be more fun (and chaotic) with more players.

Looks cool, but I handled some of the cards at Gencon and they're way too thin. It's almost regular paper. I decided I can't even try the game because I didn't want to spend the money for cards that are going to get damaged after a couple of plays.

yes, the cards suck like the pits of Hades.  almost to the point of ruining the game.  but there is a good game in there...

update:  sleeved cards in full sized sleeves.  works fine.  fiddly game, but we had great fun with it.  and the nine-year old boy loves it.

Rules seem too in-depth to get anybody seriously interested in trying it.  I used to bring it to game day events, but don't bother anymore.  Nobody seems interested.

An extremely fun racing game that uses mechanics similar to Roborally (but more forgiving).  We had a blast playing it, and the variability is tremendous.  See my review for more details...

Rules are a little vague, but nothing that reasonable beer drinking players can't work out. I've never played a game where anyone survived to the end. But it didn't matter, I had a good time.

Initial Impression; limited plays.
Some fun parts, but extremely poor rules.  Lots of circumstances left unexplained.  No parts listing (and parts are missing - planetoid).  Might be an enjoyable game if you didn't have to spend so much time trying figure out the rules (since they don't cover at least some occurrences that happen relatively frequently).

Very slow paced; playing Mario Kart has a similar feel in a hundredth of the time.  There isn't anything interesting enough present to make up for the high game length.

Fun simultaneous action game.  Nice looking board and interesting "event" cards.  THe movement cards seem to offer a lot of flexibility and allow for the option to change the direction you face quite often, a good thing when you're racing.

This game can make for a hilarious experience.  It's like RoboRally meets Mario Kart.  Space Goats.  Amoeba.  Wormholes.  Explosions and chain-reactions.  Great fun.

There's a good game in here somewhere, unfortunately I don't know where it is.  The game is very card dependant.  Unlike Robo-Rally where you have quite a few cards to burn each turn (unless you are damaged), here you only have at most one or possibly two extra cards.  But, since you have more options to move on each card, this is not as bad as it sounds.  Where I do have issues with the game is that it is geared to doom players that are behind the leaders.  Most damage comes from bombs or mines layed by players in the front of the race.  The results is that 1) there is not much direct player interaction (i.e. I shoot you with a missile) and 2) the players in the lead do not have to deal with any of these things happening.  Unlike Roborally, the deaths are typically not fun.  In Roborally, there is some perverse satisfaction in your death, you know you are going to get pushed on to a conveyor which will slowly bring you to your death by crusher as you just spin in circles, here you slowly get whittled down before you die due to a mine that someone laid, or the space amoeba gets you, etc.

All in all, I'd rather spend my 3 hours playing something that does not seem so nihilistic.

A wild and crazy "fun" game.  It would get a slightly higher rating if the cards were better quality, and the boards weren't warping, and the dials weren't cheap little paper tokens, and . . . you get the idea.  A fun experience in the vein of RoboRally, but much more forgiving and fun than its predecessor.

A blast of game. However it can be a very long game. The rules book is rough to slog through. Major events can grind the game to a halt, taking 15-20 minutes to resolve. The components leave much to be desired and have been upgraded to make it more pleasing to the eye. Still an absolute blast.

Great for a short two-player filler!  Very simple rules, but kind of brain burny trying to wrap your head around how to most efficiently rearrange the cards to your advantage while thwarting what your opponent is seemingly doing.  Frustrating and fun at the same time!  It's also apparent than Mark has a sincere interest in the subject matter, and put a lot of effort into this.

For a self-published game, this has excellent components -- I would have been satisfied with these components in a mainstream game.  The component design is excellent -- easy to see the information you need, easy to read, interesting information on the cards.  The game itself is quite entertaining, a nice puzzle.  None of my games took the advertised 30 minutes though -- they were all over more quickly.  My eight-year-old son really enjoys this game as well.  Thumbs up.

RATING: 7.5
Rather seamlessly ties together the theme with the mechanics. It feels both like a puzzle and a trick-taking game at the same time. Great for a 2-player short filler - our games seem to average 15 minutes or so. The puzzle aspect of the game means you have to use your brain and plan ahead, but watch for how the sequence changes with your opponent. The opponent's moves can often have a Fluxx-like effect on the game - about once every game my opponent will complete a sequence for me without knowing it. 

In Gene Pool, you've got a tight, fast game which begs for the players to think different... and throws some education around as well.  If made available to the masses, I could see it played on universities around the globe. This is some good work, Mark.

Thanks, Secret Santa '06... YOU ROCK. :)

Now in possession of autographed copy 32/200.  How could I not buy this as a chemical biologist?  I've only gotten in one game so far.  My initial impression is that the game is a good two-player filler with simple rules, a medium amount of luck, and possibly prone to analysis paralysis, depending on the other player.

The possible moves are straightforward and correspond to actual gene mutations (point mutation, insertion, deletion, inversion).  Like much that's based on biology and nature, this system is elegant but lends itself to some thought and strategy.

More comments when I get in another play or two.

Very nice production values for a self-produced game.  Good gameplay too.  I do worry a bit that gameplay would suffer if the players have played it enough to memorize the disease patterns, which might allow them to recognize the patterns that the opponent is trying to build, but we're a long way from that point.

Gene Pool is a clever pattern-building puzzle game, where each player races to "complete research" by manipulating a shared DNA sequence to match the DNA strand on his research card.  The game is clearly inspired by the real-life mechanisms of genetic engineering and the Research cards each give a little information on actual genetic diseases, which really ties the mechanics and theme together, though no so much that it detracts from playability--Gene Pool could easily be re- or un-themed to suit any number of pattern matching ideas.  In play, I find it reminiscent of the gem-swapping Flash games, like Bejewelled, which really appeal to my girlfriend.  I think this is a great "spouse" game; especially for women, who tend to excell at pattern recognition.

I got an early copy of Gene Pool, which will be released in July '06. This is Goadrich Game's first publishing effort and it looks great. It's a limited run of 200 and you can contact the designer, Mark, at http://games.goadrich.com/ to reserve a copy. 

I did a little late playtesting on this design with Mark and he's a co-founder of our design group, but I have no official ties with Goadrich Games, other than friendship and a desire to see this unique game in more hands!

RATING: 6.5
Sort of Phoenix, the card game. So, why have I rated Phoenix much lower than this?  Well, a number of reasons, but first and foremost, Gene Pool is way less chaotic than Phoenix, even if chaos can be still found in spades here. But you have two lines (upper and lower) you can work on, plus there are much less combinations, so it is easier to keep at least some control over what you're trying to achieve.  Last, but not least, the theme is really very appealing here in Gene Pool, while Phoenix has none. So, it may not be the best game ever, but it's interesting enough to warrant an occasional play.

RATING: 5.5
I don't usually like crossword puzzles or any other type of puzzle games for that matter.  That is why I am surprised to find that I enjoy playing Gene Pool.  It is very simple, elegant, and enjoyable.  I've played it about 6 times and would gladly play it again.  If you like puzzle games, then you'll definitely want to pick up a copy of this game.

The production value of Gene Pool it impressive for a self-published game.  The card stock is VERY thick and the graphics are clean and professional looking.  I highly recommend this game as a light filler between bigger games but I recommend it even higher as an educational tool.  This game is a great way to introduce kids to the concepts of genetic engineering.

I'm the designer, so no rating from me on this one, but I'm pretty happy with how it turned out.  This was published as a limited edition of 200 copies in 2006, I republished it October 2009 with 450 more copies, and sold out in April 2010. I'm looking for a publisher to do a larger print-run, contact me if you're interested. Playtesters have said it feels similar to Amazing Labyrinth, Phoenix and Ricochet Robots.

Players choose from a menu of actions (inversion, mutation, deletion, insertion) trying to get the order of cards on the table (constituting a DNA string with A-T and G-C segments) to match the order on their research cards (GCTTA or TCGG, for example). Research cards are worth one or two points depending on if you need to get 4 or 5 cards in the correct order. First player to 9 points wins. Very simple game, enjoyable, highly portable, but not terribly exciting.

A quick 2 player card game that has earned its weight to be added to my camping/backpacking games.  The pattern recognition takes a few hands, but then like tetris you can visualize gene transformations.  I find myself always fantasizing what the cards look like from the opponents view. (just reverse, i know)

Congratulations to Mark on his awesome self-production.  The quality is high on the cards.  The procedure for making the cards, is one I always wanted to try, but from the sounds of it, it is very labour-intensive.

I know that Mark has other great designs under his hat.  Lets hope we see them here as well!

Interesting idea for a game, and I have to credit the designer for using a different type of theme.  My initial impressions are similar to Carrousel - for such a simple/light game, it can be taxing on the brain!  I'm ashamed to admit that it was very difficult for me to visualize the different possibilities, especially inversion.

I had gotten this in an auction as a gift for my wife, who got a kick out of the theme (she's a chemical biologist). I have to admit that the theme is very well done for being, at heart, an abstract pattern game. Plus, it actually has scientifically accurate molecular structures---there are several chemistry games that just have horrendous figures that we can't play. 

Unfortunately, we didn't really enjoy the gameplay. We're not big fans of abstracts or puzzle games in the first place, although we did enjoy [thing=33154][/thing], partly again due to the strong theme. One of the criticisms of [thing=33154][/thing] is that it's very chaotic and random (although we found that two-player was better)---well, [thing=23931][/thing] is much worse. Instead of having a large two-dimensional board with more space to place tiles, you and your opponent are manipulating the same limited six-card DNA card sequence to find four and five card patterns. Everything you do will affect the other (non-aggressive couples beware). Since you don't know what sequence your opponent is looking for, you don't know if the card manipulation you're doing will help them out. As a result, it felt very random and lucky on who got their sequence filled out first.  Not for us.

How the heck did the average for this game top seven?!?!? The only real originality in this game is the theme, and its super cheesy at that. The gameplay elements are all old and super lame and the detail on disease, while commendable, is just really creepy. For some humour the designer should have made up comedic fake diseases to cure.

Edit: Wow, I must have been on a wicked caffine high for such harsh remarks. Subsequent plays have the score upped to 4.

RATING: 5.5
Update: Bumped rating up from 4 to 5.5 -- I realized that I was playing the game wrong, you can complete an objective with either "side" (up or down) of the DNA sequence. This completely changes the game experience and actually makes it too easy to complete objectives. I does shorten the game dramatically to a quick 15 minutes filler. 
I've been on an independently-published game buying spree lately and I bought this from the publisher/designer without doing much research. As a first effort, it is definitely better than a lot of first-time games, and the thought and effort that went into making it shines through. However, the game can be very frustrating at times to play, as it is too easy to disrupt your opponent's plan (even without knowing what they are) and him disrupting your plan -- and somtimes the game will get stuck in a stalemate until one of the two players blinks and draws a new objective. The goal (9 years of research) - while it fits with the theme, feels very artificial and makes the game last twice as long as it should. I think I'll stop my future games at 5 years. There are some neat ideas there, but on the whole the game didn't grab me. Could make a really good teaching tool for biology class, though.

Cute puzzle game, like the graphics, but suffers from the same problem as Amoeba - you are often undoing your opponents' moves, and you don't have the necessary information to do so in a meaningful way.

An educational game, in that the research cards have facts about various genetic diseases.

-

This is a pretty good 2-player card game. It's fairly quick, even with the moderate amount of analysis paralysis that is bound to set in. In Gene Pool, players manipulate a row of 6 cards, each card with two letters of alphabet on it, one on top of the card and one on the bottom. By manipulating this row of cards, the sequence of letters on the cards changes. Players try to modify the row of letters so as to form 4- or 5-letter sequences that match their 'Gene Research' card.
There is a good amount of chaos and unpredictability, but still the game can get very tense when both opponents are trying to match their last research card for a win.

The game has some similarities to the game of Phoenix, although not component wise.

A game of pattern recognition - more importantly seeing the potential in the fragmentary patterns on the table.  I believe that knowing what to invert to achieve your desired research chain is a key to victory as rotations move multiple bases as opposed to the more piecemeal insertion/deletion method.  Theme works very well with the game.

Well thought out handmade 2 player card game. Players are trying to add, delete or shift a string of 6 genetic cards to match strings on 'Gene' research cards. These research cards are worth 1-2 years of research (think VPs) and the first to 9 wins! There are tricky visual perception elements (you get to rotate 2 more more cards 180 degrees!) and sometimes your opponent will end up doing the work for you!

Cards are thick and sturdy. The art is functional BUT has alot of interesting information on them.

Some negatives: the black cards get smudged by finger oil too easily. I sleeved all the cards. Gameplay can be a little luck based (you might get a sequence laid out for you already) and the last turns may end up being a rotation fest on both sides until one player gets his/her way.

This is the game that When The Stars Are Right, wanted to be, but wasn't due to the exceedingly random nature of the card turns and flips that happened off your turn.  In this game your opponent's goals can be partially divined by watching what they do, and you can try to set the pairs up so they do your work for you, and you just clean up with a simple move and the research glory--hey just like professors and their grad students heheh!

Because the 6 base pair system is so simple AP is not a great problem, but also because it is so simple, a lucky research card draw can make for a fairly large swing.  Since you play to nine years it somewhat evens out, but you might want to play 3 games (as win/loss not for cumulative points) since that should even out the wild luck.

It's a fun, quick, little puzzle game!

[Goadrich Games 09 edition, 2nd print with signature] {Biology, couple; card-drafting, pattern-building, action-point} Gene Pool is a cute and thematic 2p game.  Player competes to build patterns using operations and cards in hand. It has simple and clever design.  It is very easy to learn the rules. Player interaction is good. It may be helpful to print out all required patterns of the 16 cards so that players can plan better but it may increase down time. I believe drawing 2-year research cards provides more tactical choices. There is little luck in the card draw of research deck. A typical game runs within 30 minutes, very good.

Cardstock is thick enough with nice illustration and information.

This game reminds me of Phoenix but clearly it is a better game, IMO. Recommended!  Keep up the good work, Mark!

My comments are based on a beta copy of the game, but it was very close to the finished version.  This game has taught me more about basic genetic mutation than I ever learned in high school biology.  Use mutation, insertion, and deletion to try to re-code the genetic sequence before your opponent does.  Beyond the educational value, this is a fun & fast card game for two players.  The graphics are clever, the rules are simple, and the mechanics are challenging enough that you want to try again after the game is over.  The game can be a little bit of a challenge for some people if they aren't good at visualizing the potential to flip the cards.

It is in the name...

A quick 2 player card game of saving mankind from genetic diseases. You compete to win the Nobel Prize (or complete 9 years worth of research). There are different strings to work on, each worth 1 or 2 years of research.

The higher the payout the harder they are to accomplish. On your turn you may take one of a number of actions. You can add a base pair to your hand, you can draw a new research goal or you can manipulate the existing string in various ways. The goal is to create the sequence required to complete a research goal.

This is the fun part - but also the frustrating part. You will often see your opponent ruin your setup for completion on your next turn - or hear your opponent claim research based on your actions.

It is an abstract game of spatial thinking with a bit of hand management thrown in. It can sometimes be worth it to complete a few minor goals on the way to the major ones, simply because they require fewer genes in the proper order and are therefore easier to claim.

Our games tended to take 10-15 minutes, depending on how stuck we got. It was a fun exercise in a small box that would be easy to carry around, but ultimately the game failed to hold any lasting appeal for us and posed too few challenges.

I have problems with spatial thinking and can become frustrated when the best laid plans are scuppered by my wife. It would work for me as a solo exercise, but where is the game in that.

Instead I often left feeling frustrated by my own inability to see how to get from the current position to the goal. You can argue that this is no fault of the game, but a result of my personality and you would be correct - but that said, the game still quickly wore out its welcome and eventually left.

No. 68/200. Interesting pattern recognition/manipulation game. Simple rules, yet lots of tough decisions every turn. Rating based on one play, it could rise with more plays.

A fun little game.  A row of cards are manipulated in turns as players attempt to make sequences they hold in hand.

Gene Pool is an insignificant looking game, and you might overlook it when scanning my bookcases that are crammed with piles of large, colorful games.  But it's a game that promotes science - specifically genetics - and is easily portable, sets up and is explained quickly, and rather fun for the short time it takes up.

Great concept, but the game as implemented is a bit lacking - only performing one action per turn means that there is essentially no opportunity for interesting plays.

Nice, quick, puzzle like card game.  The person who can see the most possible combinations will win. I own number 102/200, and it arrived signed by the designer (a nice touch).

Eh.  Just a game of tug of war until one player can't pull any more.

Manipulate the genetic code, and cure the diseases that plague mankind! Well, maybe not so much, but it's a fun little filler where you rotate, insert and delete cards to make them match the patterns in your hand.

There's more chaos than I expected, but it's a decent enough design.  I'd like to play it some more to see how it holds up over multiple plays.

This is a fun and quick card game unlike any I've ever played. It's simple to teach and plays quickly enough that the loser will usually want one more crack at it.

Nice filler game.  Plays quick and takes some thinking.  Seems like the two year reasearch cards are the way to go as they don't take too much extra work but reward you with more points.

After a couple more plays, I think the 2 year cards potentially flaw this game.  In nearly every game that was played it was a battle for the two year cards and whoever scored first got the upper hand and ended up with the majority of them.  If the two year cards were a sequence of six instead of five or if there were some restriction on how two year cards could be picked up and played might give the game more balance.

As it stands, both my wife and I only think this is Okay.  There are other quick fillers that we enjoy more.

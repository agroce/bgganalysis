RATING: 6
Some interesting mechanisms and an unusual theme for a trading game. A similar feel to Elfenland but the games are distinct and have different goals. A potential for too much analysis paralysis so avoid if your group are prone to that. The thing I am not sure about is the inability to judge how well you are doing during the game

I see why people would like it, but this one feels too much like a mental exercise for me. Be warned, the game is won and lost in the resource auction. I wish I like Ornella's games more than I actually do... outside of Oltremare his others have fallen flat for me.

Only 2 plays. Would like to try 4 player. Think 3 player doesn't offer enough competition for tiles and 1st player marker doesn't move around enough. 5 player is perhaps a little too competitive and difficult to get several things which can be used.

Brilliant game.  Easy to explain rules with various paths to victory.  Excellent bidding mechanism and most games are close - without falsely being made or influenced that way.  Throw on top of that the game is just fun.  Definitely requires strategic (planning which tile to take and routes to travel) as well as tactical (getting the tiles you need without allowing others to grab them) planning.  Board is also very functional.  Plus the price is outstanding.  Best value in a game in a long, long time.  Check various websites - I've seen this for as low as $16, but more than likely in the $20 - $24 range.  In my plays with now 6 other people it was universally liked.  This is the game I wanted Elfenland to be.

Mr Ornella can do no wrong. Third game I have bought and third hit. Traders supplying Hermagor. Make sure your bids in the market leave you with the right goods to journey around the province. Trade with the provinces to create the wealth to win. Excellent.

A bit of a Frankenstein's monster of a game.  An interesting, innovative and quite brutal market phase is stitched together with a dull and repetitive move and deliver phase. Emanuele Ornella really needs to find a good developer to refine his 80% designs into a superior finished product.  Played twice, with five and with three.  It moved along at a much better pace with the smaller number.

A pleasant game, which can be played, apparently, with lots of screwage. (I didn't play it that way...I tried to stay out of other people's way...on purpose.) Reminds me of Louis IV and Mykerinos, which are both good games, but I think this game is better.  The resource color scheming and iconography on the board leave a lot to be desired, needlessly complicating your necessary efforts to study the board.  Almost a "gateway abstract plus euro" game because the rules are fairly simple.

RATING: 5
(1 play, 5 player) Well, the game has certainly got a lot of stuff going on.  Just not sure how much I care after one play.  It's fun to move around the board, but the market "auction" seemed to favor the ignored player, which is how I won.  Which didn't really feel satisfying.  Okay, three of us were playing for the first time, which I'm sure had something to do with it, but if you "need" the specific items you need, then you're not really in a good position to check or balance anyone.  Also, since it was my first play, I didn't pay any attention to the river bonus thing... and I suspect I may never as it doesn't seem worth it to pass up the chance to close off an area and get that bonus.  But again, one play, so who knows?  Those 3 or 6 extra points could be huge, though I suspect not.  And I may never find out, as my desire to try this one again is minimal.

En una tierra lejana surgió una grande y rica ciudad: Hermagor. El comercio era la fuente de su riqueza, dado que hombres, artesanos y aventureros venían de todo el territorio llevando a la ciudad todo tipo de mercancías para vender: armas, libros antiguos, preciosas reliquias y los raros huevos de dragón. Algunos incluso emprendían peligrosas aventuras para obtener objetos especialmente raros. Estos aventureros crearon nuevas rutas, carreteras y mercados en las ciudades, pero siempre con el deseo de enriquecerse.

A solid economic/trading game with some area control as you move a merchant around to various villages surrounding the central city of Hermagor. Fairly thinky, but not too deep as you shift through market phases, planning and then moving about the countryside. Like the light fantasy theme and also the dun, brown, earthen colors used.

RATING: 7
Csupa jó ötletből van összegyúrva a játék, kár, hogy kicsit csúnya a tábla. A lapkák megszerzési mechanizmusa nagyon eredeti, bár épp ez a része teljesen előre tervezhetetlen, mert előfordulhat, hogy másnak is épp ugyanazok kellenek, mint nekünk. Valaki simán megszerezhet pár "eldugott" lapkát, miközben a többiek egymást ölik néhány kitüntetett lapkáért. Valószínűleg ez a fajta makacsság nem kifizetődő, hacsak nem a közvetlen riválist kell elütni a lapkától. 
Ügyesen meg van oldva az, hogy ha nem az ideális lapkákat szerzi meg valaki, akkor sem hal be teljesen a játéka, erre való az olcsóbb közlekedési mód. Az viszont már nehezen kezelhető, ha valakinek csak 1 lapka jut, pedig ilyen is előfordult a játékunk során. Ez szerintem könnyen behozhatatlan hátrányt jelenthet. 
A játékban komoly dilemmát jelent, hogy a területek körbekerítésére menjen rá valaki, vagy próbálja szétszórni a házait. A 3 régió és a főút a végén annyi pontot jelent, hogy az akár meg is fordíthatja a játékot. Összességében jó játék, meglep hogy a kistestvéréről (Charon Inc.) annyira katasztrofális véleményeket (is) hallottam. Az egyik fázis megegyezik a két játékban, csak a második lett teljesen más.
A Hermagort még máskor is szívesen játszanám, konfrontációt kedvelő játékosoknak is jó, de lehet békésen is játszani, akkor legfeljebb véletlenül teszünk keresztbe a másiknak:).

Got this out and played a 4 player game while waiting for another player to finish her dinner and join us. Played only 2 rounds but since find it pretty interesting, especially in the minigame on the left hand side of the board where you are trying to get the products to sell to the villagers.

Think this is an interesting game and will likely see more plays since the rules are pretty straightforward and easy for new players to grasp.

I prefer a similar in feel elfenland a lot. I didn't enjoy the mini inside game of resource aquisition at all, and the outside 'economic' part suffers from you not being able to have a real effect on resources' values, they all end up close, and this really changes into a race to get the most regions first.  to me this is elfenland, that has a lot less fun way of getting 'programming' cubes, and that tries to obscure the fact that all it's about is placing your huts in as many villages as possible.

Comment: good mechanics, but too less interaction.  Every move has to be optimized, so you can really think a while before making your move (which makes the game rather long).  No elements of luck.

The market is heart of this game. It is a very well thought out concept which works extremely well. You will have to balance spending money for good places on the board with placing you traders in less powerfull positions to gain more income. The travelling bit is less original and brings the total rating down a bit. But still a game everybody has got to try.

Wow, the font selection for the rules was a TERRIBLE choice.

The box is ugly, the board is ugly and sometimes hard to decipher, but the game is terrific. I really enjoyed it and will be buying it. This is one of the games that I wouldn't have discovered if it wasn't for the someone else owning it because the graphic presentation was just so hideous.

I like how the bidding for tiles/goods interacts with where you are able to place on the board and then both of those interact with the payout table and the end of game payouts.

Only played once so far but I really, really enjoyed it. The market is an excellent device. Soon found out that going for the lowest numbered tile just to put the person on your left on lead is a nasty but helpful tactic.

RATING: 6.5
Neat optimization & economic game.  The bulk of this game is spent carefully placing your limited number of workers in the market to acquire tiles, while earning the as much revenue from rumors as you can (by aligning your workers in the same rows).  All of the goods tend to move forward at a pretty even pace... so it doesn't really matter which ones you encircle on the board... you just want to encircle as many different types as you can... and encircle them as early as you can to get more bonus points.

I wanted to like this one - the market is clever, but seems rather harsh if you make a mistake and you can get squeezed out of the market if the other players want to do that, but that's okay as it's the only real bit of player interaction. Lots to think about here - maybe too much as you have to plan your trade 'routes' right from the start, either that or waste money (VPs) making overly long trips. However turn order is vital, and dependant on who gets the lowest chit in the market (they choose), don't like this aspect at all, and it has such a major impact on the rest of the game. It's on the trade pile now ... ***Update, traded, doubt I'll play this again now.

One play w/5. It may deserve one more play, but does not deserve any comparison to Goa. The theme is not only tacked on, its also ugly and slightly askew. The auction mechanic is the climb up the roller coaster and the route building is just the ride down, no decisions (not much game) to make at that point. I found the auction to be a tad clunky in its execution and it may play a bit better with 4 due to the symmetry of the market. I'll play it again but Im afraid it may just solidify my initial opinion that this game doesnt need to be played.

With the additional score sheet from the BGG file section.
Pay off first when you placed all of your 4 buyers and get the bonus money for 4 in a row cash-straits. House rule: When one player has bought only 1 product tile and sold his stuff in all three demanding towns, he can travel, confirm the rules, to Hermagor. There he/she can buy one remaining product-tile from the market.

It seems the author has a knack for combining lots of mechanisms into one game, but here they don't mesh well enough for me to change my "like" to "love". The market auction mechanism is probably strong enough to stand on its own without the routing/placement mechanism.

RATING: 8.5
A very good game this one - an interesting simultaneaous multiple auction to start followed by a travelling salesman optimization problem to solve - and if you really need to be sure part one delivers what you need for part two of you're stuffed.  There's more to it that that but those are the basics and there is never one true path to sucess so flexibility helps, indeed is vital unless you, unlike me, can win every bid.  Good gamers' game.  The closest parall;el is probably Elfenroads, so no surprise I like this I suppose.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Hermagor reminds me a lot of Elfenland, except with a heavy financial layer added on top.  A lot like Elfenland in that you plan your route, and then try and vie for the items you need to make that route successful.  The first half of every round is spent getting goods in a weird little area control game, and the second half is traveling around the board selling those goods for cash.  On top of just buying and selling stuff, you get bonuses for selling stuff in certain groups of cities or on certain locations of the map.  Overall, it feels like a mish mash of a lot of stuff, but the game actually pulls it all off pretty well.

Good game, it's kinda got a mini game in the game with the market phase(acquiring the goods) and then moves on with the meat of the game selling what was picked up at the market. The game is not complicated, but may seem so at first impressions. The mechanics are great and tie into the game well. There's a lot of money exchanging hands and is very hard to keep up with who has what. I think the game is a little long for a game of this type, but this is my initial view after 1 play.

Almost the entire game takes place in the auction for tiles.  The actual travelling salesman portion of the board play is almost automatic and mostly obvious.  While there are some pleasant subtleties to the auction, the game design is relatively incoherent and uncoordinated.  The many ways of scoring VPs, of affecting other's incomes etc are frankly a jumble in need of further game development.....and yet it works somewhat as a game.  

Update: The problem is that the zero-sum incentives are too large for each player to ensure that no other player's market plans are profitable.  The result is that the marketplace resolution becomes an extensive analysis problem resulting in nobody getting anything, or at least enough of anything they needed, thus forcing a game of dollar-thin attrition.

Hermagor is nothing amazing, but it is good for what it is, which is a medium weight, fairly calculating game that has two distinct zones of play which are both important.

In the first phase of the game players put pieces down to gain goods in the market. After those goods are divvied out, they then wander around the board selling those goods to towns, leaving houses behind. When one sells goods, then money is generated (victory points). This money is also used to move around on the roads, and to place pieces in the market to get goods to begin with. As I said, when one sells a good, one also places a house. When a given area is surrounded, then another bonus scoring effect occurs.

I know it sounds somewhat convoluted, but it's really fairly easy to pick up once you understand how the game is structured. The key to it seemed to be investing correctly in the market, because having access to the right goods was key to making the best return on the actual selling phase (not surprising there).

Again though, this game isn't anything really original or new. It is nice in that it has a lot of difficult choices throughout, and because it plays quickly, but it didn't really wow me either. Another in the long Elfenland / Ticket to Ride / Around the World in 80 Days / Marco Polo Expedition lineage, of which I only really enjoy Elfengold.

A very enjoyable game. The placing of buyers is the high point of the game. But the stock manipulation can be important as well. Not sure if we did one rule right. That being if you buy more than one stock of a certain item you only get paid once.

Még várok a végleges pontozással, látok benne fantáziát, de elsőre annyira nem jött be, mint vártam.

Update: kb. 5-6. játék után feltűnő, hogy a játékmechanizmus szinte tökéletes. Izgalmas, végletekig kiélezett játszmákat lehet vele nyomni. Első negatívabb megítélés után a játékmechanizmus tökélye miatt pontszámemelkedés történt! Hátránya a barnás design. Nekünk nem tetszik a kinézete...

This game is an interesting blend of both tactical (marketplace) and strategic (map) thinking.  The pieces work together well in that the items won by a player in the marketplace influences what, and hence where, they can sell on the map.

This was a pleasant surprise.  This was my favorite, older game played at ConnCon 2015.  Maicek was gracious to offer me a seat and teach 3 players, new to the game.  Reminded me of Power Grid with a good dose of travelling around the board to re-position yourself for scoring.  Excellent!

RATING: 7.5
Good, standard, thin-themed eurogame that nevertheless seemed pretty unique, in my experience anyway. Although, it make you think a little of Elfenland on Steriods, but I liked this game much better than Elfenland. If you try to optimize everything you will likely blow a gasket. Maybe a little dry, and maybe too many things to weigh. Artwork could have been nicer. But if you like euros, this is absolutely one to try.

A nice step up from games like Web of Power / China.  Add currency and some cutthroat competition in a way equal to, but quite different from, Hacienda.  Almost if someone took the complexity of Hansa Teutonica in a fairly different direction.  After 2 games it seems very difficult to balance the various end game scoring bonuses - still trying to decide which are best to focus on. And let me make sure to point out the mediocre design of the rules - seems like they wanted to save the cost on printing so they chose a really small font with no line breaks.

This is the latest game by Emanuele Ornella (Oltre Mare, Il Principe). I really like this guy’s designs. His games really seem to have some unique stuff going on. This one sort of reminded me of Elfenland, in that you’re trying to make a route covering as much of the board as possible, but rather than simply getting dealt cards, there’s a city board where you get to use merchants to try to get different goods that you can sell to make your path. And rather than just “making your path”, efficiency counts, as all roads have costs, and getting the goods has costs. There’s a lot of adding and subtracting, and a lot of thinking, to be sure (although I completely ignored what other people needed and seemed to do ok).

Hermagor was on my to-try list for a while, but other titles took precedence when I first had the opportunity to give it a go. In this game, you are merchants setting up shops in various cities of the fictional country of Hermagor. You buy your wares in a market with a bit of an odd majority mechanism operating within it, then walk around on the map (reminiscent of Elfenland or even Funkenschlag) to sell them. 

This game was my first encounter with Ornella's way of designing, and it is not a way I agree with very much. Ornella prefers choice in his games, the more the better. However, I like to have [i]meaningful[/i] choices, not choices which are the equivalent of a forest road splitting up for a few steps and then rejoining again. Hermagor is full of these silly things, as is illustrated by the multitude of elements for which you get a bit of cash or points. The disruptive micromanagement which ensues (imagine collecting over a 100 money units in amounts of 2 to 5 units per time you receive any) sucked away my enthusiasm to play this title anew with gusto. [i]Real[/i] decisions are hard to come by in this game; only in the market do you have some hope of getting any. But even there you don't really have much time or opportunity, especially when it comes to choices dealing with the actions of other players: there are but four tradesmen to be placed, and your best hope is a little collateral hindrance at best. If you can make it harder for a player to get a specific tile while at the same time benefiting, go for it. Otherwise the choice is simple: go for your own profit.

The curious thing is that Hermagor seems to be a mishmash of all sorts of games, but that the author, not having played these games, invented these elements on his own for this title. I suppose that makes Hermagor an unintentional Frankenstein of sorts which appears fresh to anyone not familiar with those titles... But stale and repetitive to anyone who [i]is[/i]. It's been a long time since I played this game, and I think the game deserves a second playing to determine whether my initial feelings were correct. But I'm sceptical as to whether they'll budge.

[b]Update[/b] Between writing the above I was able to play the game a few times, even using my own copy because my partner wanted to take it home with us from some forgotten Spiel. Regrettably the pointless map part could not inspire the players to play this game more often than the initial attempts, favouring instead the stand-alone majorities game Charon, Inc. At some point Hermagor was let go, and that will hopefully be the end of any flirtations with this design by Ornella.

First play June 2008.  Enjoyed this game a lot.  Would need to play it more to develop a better strategy.  Start player seems to have a very strong influence on this game.  Will need to experiment more now that all the rules have come together.

Second play Decembere 2008.  Still enjoy this game.  Starting to understand the market a bit more.  Still trying to get my head around the key area to focus on in this game.

This one is a solid game.  Have played a few times now with a rules error or two on my part, largely due to my going on memory of the first play.  Oops!  Still the basic mechanics of the game have always been intact and the fun of the game is clear.  It is an interesting mix of strategic placement and money management, plus some luck thrown in for good measure.  The game is better with more people.  The two-player game, while still good, lacks the competition in the market.

Hermagor is a very solid euro game.  The rules initially frustrated my group and are so-so written.  However, Hermagor, once learned properly, is an amazing euro game!  The game mechanics are very different from other euro style games.  The first half of a turn is spent "positioning" to gain certain tiles for use in the second half of the turn.  Hermagor requires constantly pre-planning your medium term game strategy and then attempting to stick with it with small deviances in game play as "situations" and "developments" arise.  This is a thinker's euro style game with very good game mechanics, but also very engaging and can be a deep thought process type of game - not to be confused with a "heavy euro style game".  All in all, I was sold on Hermagor after one play and am glad it is part of my game collection. This game apparently plays best with 5 players, which was the number in my game, and the game was tight with everyone in contention for the win.  Lastly, Hermagor has very little down time and most players are constantly consumed with "figuring" their next move out, as the game dynamics are constantly in flux.

A somewhat odd game that has two distinct parts. Like those with whom I've played, the "bid for influence in the market" part is the better half. Still, I like the puzzle of trying to combine what I can win in the market with efficient travel on the map.

Strategical planning game with an original auction mechanic in which you should try to keep more than one option open. Lots of different mechanisms and scoring ways make it hard to see what the others are up to and to block them, which makes the blocking a little bit too random.

A very nice game or 2 games in one as it may be.  A great nead for detailed, long term planning, but the market can undue the best laid plans.  Doesnt quite hit the "amazing" niche for me, but a very excellent design.  5 player is probably too long and cluttered for my tastes but I'm looking forward to a 4 player game soon.  Wish it wasn't a fantasy them, but I still enjoy the game nonetheless.

Hermagor is a kludge of all the nifty mechanics that made other games (Power Grid, Thurn and Taxis, Ys, Himalaya) great.  The various mechanics barely hold together as Hermagor clumsily lumbers about, staggering under its own weight and top-heaviness.  It's not a bad game, but it's incredibly inelegant.  Sadly, the board, though beautiful, is confusing and impractical, being more a detraction from play than a suppliment to it.

There's a good mechanic here for bidding for tiles based on your pieces' positions around the tiles.

However, the art and the feel of the game just sort of dragged for us. (It's a fairly drab color palette.)

We felt like this game and Hansa Teutonica had similar route-building aspects... but Hansa Teutonica is a lot more fun.

The market part is a nice abstract area control exercise with no real thematic connection with the rest of the game.  It actually seems as if there were two separate games in here.

RATING: 3.5
Wow, I am surprised this is rated so high!  This game could be a 7 if it did not get bogged down in endless accounting.  Playing banker is a full-time job. I just did the math and the banker has to pay out about 300 times in a 5 player game!  In the end, all of the $1 transactions pretty much cancel each other out and have VERY little effect on the outcome of the game.  

In the selling part of the game, almost all of your mental energy will be spent trying to figure out what all of your options are, instead of choosing between them.  Once you've figured out how much you make with the various options, you simply choose the best one.  Never once do you have to make a judgement.  This is not how I like to spend my free time.

-- EDIT -- I raised my rating from a 3 because the market mechanic is pretty cool and innovative.  Even so, I don't think I'll ever be "talked into it on occasion" which is why I cannot rate it a 4.

It is a game of purchasing goods and setting up trade outpost where you then sell the goods. Should you surround regions with said outposts, you then get some bonus, either from goods or from honor. The rules themselves are not overly complicated, but their interactions can be quite subtle. When purchasing goods for example, you place your buyers between the goods tiles, with different costs depending on whether you are between 2 tiles or are at the corners, touching 4 tiles. Once all the buyers are placed, you look at who gets the tiles (simple majority, with corners being used as tie breaker) which you then take. There is also a bonus round, based on whether you have 1, 2, 3 or 4 buyers in a line. This is just the first part, with the second part seeing your "traveling salesman" going around village to village, selling the goods. Of course, you need to pay for his travel, with links between different villages being different prices. Selling gives you money, and should you surround a region, you get a bonus, which can then pay more at the end of the game. I'm skipping some rules here, but as you can see, lots of little rules which are not complex in and of themselves, but which add up really quickly and whose repercussions are not apparent at first. Fun, but in a brain burning way. Will probably be much better the next time i play as i now know how things are tied together.

Nem is tudom miért vettem meg. Anno szabályt előtte nem olvastam, csak tudtam, h Ornella, de akkor még őt sem annyira ismertem. És h mennyire jól tettem, h megvettem! Nagyon jó játék. Az első fele az izgalom és a konfrontáció, tudni kell időben váltani, vagy mindenáron ragaszkodni. És utána sikeres vásárlás esetén csak menetelés, kevesebb siker esetén újra tervezés. A végén a pontozás is jó: egyrészt van lehetőségem növelni időben a nekem tetszőket, és nem növelni a nekem nem tetszőket, no meg 2 apróságnak tűnő, és kevés pont sorsa, de igen fontos 4-8 pontok: az úton szereplés, és a területek legkevesebbje. Szóval összetett, konfrontáció lehetősége, időben kell módosítani, de nem elveszett játék esély. Szeretem.
Update: Eljött ez az idő is: nem nyertem meg 1 játékot. :-). (Jó eddig sem volt sok partim ebből, de a 6. játék nem az én győzelmem hozta) Szoros versenyben -2 pont- lettem második. De ettől még továbbra is jó, és áll a fentebbi: sok lehetőség, tudni kell konfrontálni, és tudni kell időben váltani, és mindig alternatív utakban is gondolkodni. És a végén sokat számít a terület és út pont is. Az útnál pl. a győztessel szemben 10 pont mínuszom volt /ő nyerte:+5, én az utolsó:-5/, tehát bár látszólag semmi pontok, de sokat érnek. /Ugyanakkor persze nem csak ezen ment el a győzelmem, hanem pl. mert a győztesre nem figyeltem, valahogy úgy éreztem, h egy másik játékos áll jól, aki mint kiderült utolsó lett, ha jobban mérem fel a helyzetet....na de ez van, szép játékban veszítettem./
update 2: nagy királyság továbbra is, és visszaállt a helyzet: nyertem :-)
Na és ami még fontos: a piacon úgy kell tudni konfrontálni, h ha van lehetőség azért nem árt finoman keresztbe tenni.

I bought this game used at a gaming convention. I read over the reviews here first and noticed that even the lower raters didn't really have terrible things to say about it. After playing the game, I'm very happy that I bought it. The market mechanic was unique and cool. I really liked how the whole game tied together - you buy things, then travel around and sell them, you get extra money for having trade stations along the main road and in multiple shires, etc. I am looking forward to playing again.

Another mechanical blender game from Ornella that works quite well as a game of efficiency.  There is the unforgiving area-control market grid that players battle to get commodities, which are then sold on the main board by travelling around and dropping off houses similar to Thurn and Taxis.  Like Il Principe, there are numerous ways to get money (victory points), so a balanced game is key to victory.

I'd like to stay retired at this one with my undefeated 3-0 record as I've no interest in spending that much time on so few decisions. Yes, the market is quite interesting, but there's a lot of luck involved in which tiles come up and when, and the route management part of the game degrades into AP. Too much time spent crunching numbers rather than debating interesting moves. Watching people go through their routes it dull with the exceptional moment when you get incidentally impacted, then it's simply not fun.

Not sure if this will hold up, but after my third play, I told my friends how I win this game every time: build along the road first to ensure the road bonus then branch out as necessary from there.

A lot of depth considering the rules are few and straight-forward.  The balance of the market system (to acquire goods) with the map (to deliver at the villages) makes the game very tense.  There are moments when it's critical to get a specific type of good, but the tiles drawn have limited availability.

There is a lot of suspense because you find yourself with a huge preference of placing pawns to earn the most money.  But the delicate area majority tie-breakers create much tension & fear on what your opponents can potentially do to thwart you.

As a result, between each and every opponent's pawn placement you find yourself feeling cringing agony or a HUGE sigh of relief.  Our entire group was on "pins & needles".  The hook of this game brings a similar sensation one may feel by going "all-in" in a poker tournament.  In my opinion, this is one of the most grossly underrated games on the geek.  Our first game took nearly 4 hours (with 5 players).  Hopefully this can be cut down to nearly half with repeated plays.  A-

RATING: 7
A route building game somewhat akin to Thurn & Taxis. What makes it feel very different, however, is that, instead of simply taking the cards you need from a random display, you use a number of merchant pawns to bid for them. Each player has the same number of merchants, and by placing them somewhere on the market you exert "influence" on certain cards. Some positions affect many cards, others fewer but more powerfully so it becomes more difficult for someone else to take them away from you. The cards you get from the market define where you can build trading posts and sell goods during the following turn.

While the market is maybe the single most important aspect of the game, it's not where you get most of your money from. That comes either directly from selling goods, or more indirectly through completing regions which allows you to build factories or earns you honour points.

Many ways to score, interesting twists in midgame when some players don't get the cards they wanted for their chosen strategy, and subtle (and sometimes not so subtle) means to royally screw your opponents by denying them their cards or taking the last factory spots right before they were going to score.

Based on one 5 player game:  For me, this game has two parts:  a tedious luckfest, where it's very easy to get locked out from what you need (particularly if you are the first player), followed by a tedious route optimisation part, which is either obvious (if you got what you wanted in the first part) or, frankly, irrelevant if you didn't.  Add to this the fiddliness of the money and the significant AP issues, and you have a game which, for me, has all the enjoyment value of falling into a silage vat.

Argh.  The more I think about it, the more I think it's a mess.  It's cluttered, it's unfocused, it's everywhere.  Trying to be too many games, and doesn't do that nearly as well as Caylus, and even Caylus didn't do it that well.

Unfortunately, one of the worst, most boring games I've played.

Yes the gameboard is ugly, but the game is very good. The auctioning is like a mini game and is a brilliant and fun feature. I almost bought Elfenland, but decided this was similar and had more depth and a better replay value. I am glad I bought this game instead. It's a very clever fun game. I highly recommend that you at least give it a try.

WOW! If it wasn't for the ugly and disgusting graphics I would have rated it 9. The game itself is outstanding! Pretty simple rules but A LOT to plan and consider, easy-to-understand gameplay, a few ways to score and win, tight competition, good overview of what's going on on the board and only this components... They're REALLY ugly and can make new players run away from the board with a scream.

I like how the elements of the mechanics click and work together - it's one of these elegants concepts that make a strong impression at the first glance and it lasts after the play.

Strongly recommend.

RATING: 5
Rating after one play with 5. It's all about the do-or-die tile auction. Once that's resolved, one's itinerary on the map side of the board is but a foregone conclusion with very little opportunity for creative decision making. Unfortunately, the traveling salesman portion of the game is also the part that takes the longest, what with downtime and money shuffling. Might be interesting with fewer players, but I kind of doubt it.

RATING: 7
While it looks like Thurn & Taxis with a map of routes and houses, it plays quite differently, with added interaction and hence complexity due to the innovative auction system. I am looking forward to exploring further - impressed so far.  Most annoying feature is fiddliness changing small amounts of money.  In my last game with 2 newbies I dropped the costing sub-system of the auction house - so you didn't pay for the position, but nor did you get payments for the rows and columns - the money pretty much cancels out in the game anyway.  Seems to work fine.  In the future I'll keep that as the 'advanced' game.

I like this man Ornella.  He is 3 for 3 with me.  He mixes those mechanics, and Hermagor is no exception.  I like how the Market actions influence your route deliveries and vice versa.  You really have to think ahead a little bit.  We played wrong, and the money was too tight and very unforgiving and yet I still enjoyed it.  The box cover I like, but the game board is a little drab.  The theme is arbitrary but I would much rather buy and sell human skulls than fabric, spices, and perfume.  Needs another play.

Update: Still got rules wrong and not everyone caught on to some of the rules.  The rules are not clearly laid out, and the script font looks nice, but stinks when you are trying to look up and clarify things.  To me the game feel like Goa meets Thurn & Taxis which is a positive in my book.

Hermagor struck me as something like the gamer's version of Thurn and Taxis.  As expected from designer Emanuele Ornella, there are mechanics whizzing around all over the place, definitely one or two too many.  For example, the costs and payouts associated with placing the buyers in the market should probably have been amputated.  But unlike his previous game Il Principe, this time I felt that I was choosing the direction I moved rather than simply riding a conveyor belt.  Hermagor is a game of pennies and nickels, in which you win by accumulating small efficiencies.  While it's tactically interesting, I prefer a game with more of a storyline.  A more cynical designer might have titled this game "Making Change: The Game."

One play with four. It was pretty engaging and enjoyable, though I felt like there was a bit of a disconnect between the wild-and-woolly market phase and the rest of the business with the map. It seems like the unpredictable market ought to be the centerpiece of a somewhat shorter and lighter game, but instead there is a rather complicated game built up around it with a seemingly endless number of point-scoring possibilities.

Sometimes I don't agree when I read comments like "typical Eurogame with pasted on theme". However with Hermagor this seems true. On one side, there is not a single mechanism which was "never seen before" on the otherside the mix works well and creates a lot of tension. The board does not win a prize in terms of usability but it's decent fun to play as long you like Eurogames. The font of the rule book is not that easy to read...

Your placement (and your opponents) on the delivery board has a huge impact on what to target in the market portion of the game.

Didn't do anything for me.  It took way too long for what I got out of it.  Even though the scoring is very different, it basically seemed like a glorified, unnecessarily complicated version of Elfenland: in the end, you'll score the most points if you visit the greatest number of towns as efficiently as possible.  I won the only game I played, and there's definitely strategy in there, but the game would need to be about half as long to be more fun.

The setting of Hermagor is familiar:  a medieval city wherein players obtain goods, then travel around the countryside to sell them for a profit.  Fortunately, in spite of its familiarity, the game has some unique mechanisms and feels different.  Particularly, the method whereby players acquire goods seems original and is quite competitive.  

As with the designer’s previous title -- Il Principe -- there is a LOT to consider here.  There are numerous ways to earn victory points, and players must attempt to strike a balance between them.  This isn’t easy, as once a player begins moving on the map, it is more efficient to concentrate on a logical path wherein the towns are in close proximity.  This often means that certain areas of the map are neglected, which can significantly impact one’s final income and ultimate standing.  Balancing all of the possible ways to earn gold is a huge challenge, and should keep the game intriguing far into the future.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
An economic game that feels like two smaller ones: an area control game during the buying phase, and a game of connections in the selling phase. The latter has some slight reminiscences of "Power Grid" (building costs), "Australia" (closing regions) and "Maharaja" (receiving money if opponents choose villages where you have built). Overall a good mix of mechanics, but the multitude of ways to score make it very hard to evaluate your actions, much like in another Ornella's game, "Il Principe". Also, the game is quite long.

Kudos for having a fantasy theme instead of the tired Italian Renaissance or the like! However, I expect fantasy games to have more than commerce to it, not to mention better artwork. In fact, ugliness seems to be a feature of all the designer's games so far, but this time it even gets in the way of gameplay.

Only played it once, and got pasted.  I don't understand the auction mechanism very well -- should I focus on just one tile to make sure I get it, or spread out and possibly not get any tiles?  Should I try to get money from market buzz, or play for more tiles instead (including the screw-your-neighbour tactic of stealing tiles that you don't really need)?

I also don't like having to keep track of what goods all the other players probably want to sell next turn.  It's a lot to consider before an auction phase.

Furthermore, hidden points games are annoying.

It is a mish-mash of various things, but I think it is Elvengold (or roads) like, but an improvement.  I like the bidding for the tiles by placing the guys, I find that to be quite clever.

The tile auction is by far the best bit of this game, i.e. it's something original. Many at the table felt it was best to place last in the auction grid, but I'm not convinced as the 'good' spots may be gone by then. The rest is nothing more than an Elfenland variant, a real shame.

RATING: 7
This is a highly unusual game whose rating could rise.  The bidding system is built around a spatial system where you may have some difficulty assuring yourself of anything but can certainly gamble for the big gains (and of course, the value of the resources you are bidding on varies over the course of the game and is different from player to player--a feature I always enjoy). Racing around the board is almost a pick-up-and-deliver game--well, without the picking up, but it retains some of that feel. There is certainly scope for the losing player to come back.  There's always a risk in making long term plans, but the short term lasts long enough that your short term planning can be satisfying several times over.  Very interesting. (2 plays)

I really like what Hermagor does, and how it does it (flimsy paper money aside). For being a somewhat drab board, its theme of traveling and selling goods, planning your route, and buying goods that you need comes across quite well. We liked the artwork and the colors on the tiles. The "spacial bidding" reminded me a bit of Goa, but overall I felt Hermagor was different than other things we had played, and I found it enjoyable. The phases had good variety and were a good length. With the bidding, you had to decide what you really wanted, and go for it. It was a matter of priorities.

I liked the balance in the game, how different positions on the bidding grid cost different amounts, but were weighted differently, and how the corridors "paid you back". In the same vein, I liked how the areas on the board were scored differently - you were rewarded for surrounding an area, but also for spreading out (the dukedoms and the main road). Often I find the endgame bonus calculation to be somewhat tedious or random, but I quite liked the variety (and reasoning) behind the ones in Hermagor. The font (and translation) in the rulebook left something to be desired, but overall I found it enjoyable, and I'm glad to have played it.

This was a good game, but there were a few imbalances in the game; none of them were major enough to really change the game...  There were some of the commodities that seemed to get "left out"...  There were only two places that they were located on the board (and near the edges), so they seemed to never get purchased...  If that's the only downfall of the game that I noticed, than it is a pretty good game...  Haven't decided whether to purchase the game or not...  I think another play will be necessary before making that decision...   12/16/06

RATING: 7
After a single game with 4 players. Overall I liked Hermagor but I have some reservations about aspects of the game. The market phase is a highlight but it has a very different feel from the selling phase; whereas the market is highly competitive and its layout cannot be predicted in advance, the selling is methodical, demands longer-term planning and has little interaction between the players. I appreciate games with multiple and mutually-related ways of earning whatever units determine the winner of the game. However, in Hermagor money is both the main resource during the game and the only determinant of victory at the end (and, furthermore, it is secret). Given this, there are possibly too many ways of acquiring money.

RATING: 8
I was really put off by the artwork on this game and opening the box, I did not feel any better.  This map is needlessly busy.  And, I do think it would be easier to understand this game if it was based in real geography and goods (like say, in Africa, which the map sort of resembles anyway).  That said, I should know to trust Emanuele Ornella.  He has kind of a kitchen sink approach to design.  Yet, the complexity of the interrelationships of his designs is part of the appeal.  They seem to gell into a pleasing whole that does not fell quite like anything else you have played.  I really liked Il Principe and Oltre Mare.  Hermagor delivers that same kind of punch and perhaps a touch more depth.

After 1 play.

Oh boy - it's so difficult to judge this after 1 play.  I have mixed feelings.  It has some interesting elements of mechanics (original licitation!), which are supposed to work together; it has multiple sources of scoring, which allows you to set different priorities and strategies. 
BUT - the game lacks something, the mechanics seems artificial, there's no elegance and finesse.  You have no special satisfaction from playing it.
And one other thing that bugs me: you cannot measure your progress against other players - only very, very approximately.

RATING: 7
Bastard child of YS and Elfenland that actually turns out pretty well. 

Two very distinct phases make up this game, the placement market which somewhat resembles YS (nothing is blind however) and the route planning which was very much like Elfenland. I found the placement market phase to be excellent and very balanced and it is very interactive and competitive, definitely the best part of the game. The second half is much more mechanical but it is tied to the first half and while not as interactive it plays a good part in the game and dictates your planning and what you vie for in the placement market.

Lots of interesting ways to score got my interest going right off the hop. Scoring is quite balanced and involved ensuring you have lots of things to keep an eye on like; placement scoring, selling, endgame scoring from the value market and area bonuses on the board. The last one forces you to 'try' to be everywhere on the board as you get points for being in many places and for your weakest area on the board. 

Best with 5 I think for the extra competition but still good for 4 too.  Some screwage in the market but pretty much none on the board, more of a race to get the bonuses before they're gone and a little possible in the value market manipulations.

Strengths are the balance, multiple ways to score and interaction/competition in the market.  Plays fairly fast, a little AP but not much, just some planning is necessary. Very little luck, and surprisingly NO REAL CHAOS with 5 players which was nice, no real screwage either but nice competition in the market. Cons might be too samey after several games and the delivery part is fairly dry and mechanical.

RATING: 9.5
Fun game with a good mix of mechanics.  There is a market where you bid to try to gain control of tiles.  The tiles allow you to sell goods in particular cities and influence the price of goods at the end of the game.  Once you have set up in a city, other players get paid (from the bank, not you) when they sell goods there.  You want to gain control of certain parts of the board and also develop a long network for end-game points.  It is a nice-mix of immediate game planning and long-range planning.  It is pretty forgiving of early mistakes, which is nice for newbies.  I like it a lot.  The market placements are brutal, however.  They can result in hurt feelings.

I wasn't sure if I'd like this game after reading through the rules... they seemed to be contradictory in places and I didn't think that I'd like the market mechanism.  I was wrong... after one play, I was hooked.  

It's money management to the ultimate degree.  Do you place a buyer knowing that you aren't going to get your money back this round?  Do you play cautious during sales, moving slowly an making sure that you maximise points, or play a little more haphazard generating income whenever you can?

There's almost too much to handle... and everything you do affects what you want to do in the following rounds.  Not getting a resource tile can seriously hamper plans, but new avenues seem to open up if you want to spend a little more.

Our first game was with four players, and after the final bonuses were paid, the scores ended up 111-108-103-103!  Only $8 separated high and low... you couldn't get much closer.

Everyone wanted to play again immediately... which is a rarity in our group, so it must be a winner.  An easy '8.'  


Addendum:  I have since played the game with a full table of 5 players and I think that the game plays a little better with 4.  There seems to be more fighting for resource tiles because there are only 16 available instead of 20.  5 is good... 4 is better!

Good buying and selling game.  Lots of things to take into consideration when deciding what product you want your buyers to buy.  If you get stuck with only obtaining one product this will constitute having to pass on some of your actions which really hurts you.  Otherwise I thought was a great game.  This game has mechanics of many games, and work well together.

Although the core of the game is the buying of goods, a majority of you scoring points come from managing you path and buy the appropriate goods so the you can close off areas of the board and place you chips on the price track, which can make or break you in my opinion.

Hermagor is like the ugly girl you wouldn't think to date but has all the same interests as you and whom you love to converse with.

Played once with 2.  I don't care for the art and color choice at all.  The graphic presentation is pretty terrible, as are the icon choices.  the components are functional, but not pleasing.


Having said this,  I do really like the bidding mechanic and the game overall. It feels really easy to play, yet makes for some hard choices that build to a steady and satisfying ending.  Doesn't overstay.

Clever and enjoyable, even if sometimes frustratingly fiddly.

The first part of the turn is a majority battle to control tiles.  Those tiles will determine which spaces on the main part of the board you can score on.  More tiles = more flexibility, and depending on where you are on the board, some tiles may be "do or die" - a good gaming element.

In the second part of the turn, you move around the board placing houses (a bit like Elfenland or even Thurn & Taxis), gaining income wherever you do so.  There are additional payoffs for enclosing areas and spreading yourself out across the board.  The wrinkle here is that you may only place a house on a space marked with a symbol that matches one of the tiles you collected in the first part of the turn.  So you must maintain focus but also flexibility.

A bit too big for what it is. One of the central mechanics of this game was retooled by the designer as a separate game called Charon Inc. I played it first and love it and so I thought Hermagor might be great as well... not so much.

It felt rather fiddly and rather a mish-mosh of other mechanics... but that's only after one play and in reflecting on it, I think I might want to get some replays in to see if there is more depth and strategy there.  It may be that the first play was just about mastering what's going on, and in that respect it felt more like the game was playing us... too, we played with 3 and that might have cut some of the interaction adn intricacy out.

I agree with comments that Hermagor feels like a gamers' version of Elfenland or Thurn and Taxis. Which is great as both are among my favourite games. Elfenland is the better comparison though. The simple tile distribution of Elfenland has been replaced with a market mechanism which has area majorities at its core. Additionally, a monetary system has been added to the game. 
As usual with Czarne's graphics they are disturbing. Some people might be disturbed as well by the classification of the graveyard as a production building. But I guess that's what fantasy is about. The game is AP prone but I enjoy it enough that it's fine with me.

There are a lot of rules to digest initially, though it all quickly falls into place.  The multitude of rules makes it feel a little clunky, but the game is instantly set apart by the very innovative bidding system.  This grid placement bidding method is really cool and allows for multiple strategies, risk-taking and quite a bit of potential screwage.  Thematically, the game makes little sense, but it is still a pretty attractive board - I really like the goods tiles.

Update: I like the bidding chart, but the rest kind of leaves me cold.  It all works, but there's too many rules and it feels like too much was packed into the game, not allowing it to really excel at anything.

Blech, look at that ugly map until you just want the game to be over.  The bidding "grid" is amusing, until you see that it's more negotiation than bidding and that it is pretty much the entire game, since there are no real decisions in the "deliver" part.  You go the cheapest way to maximize your points with the stuff that you picked up in the negotiation/auction.  So, an exercise in tedium in another failed Euro design that ended up being just a horrible mutant lovechild of Diplomacy and some random pick up and deliver game.

Hermagor feels a lot like less streamlined version of Thurn & Taxis. The market is easily the best part of the game (and adds some player interaction), but the rest of the game is uninteresting with loads of obvious choices and no significant player interaction.

Just like Ornella's Il Principe previously, this design also feels "messy" and could use some work. Even the Rio Grande rules guy who taught us the game at Essen recommended just forgetting one rule and using variant to replace another.

Hermagor is a good 2 in one game,It seems a little Thurn und Taxis but is more complex and has a combination of interesting mechanics,the only bad thing is the setting,they decide for a fantasy one not so suited for an economic game,usually economic player doesn't like too much fantasy in their games they prefer reality...

First, the board is a total visual mess. The graphics of the board makes it very hard to analyse, it could have been better presented. Second, the  biggest part of the game is to bid for the goods, because there is absolutely no conflict between players when traveling and selling good. There is also a couple of rules easy to forget that does not change much things to the game. Example, gain 1$ when another player build a post where you are. In overall I did not liked it much, but at least it reflected a bit more the concept of caravan and trade routes than some other games ... like shreazam.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a nice tile bidding and route planning game.  I like the unique bidding mechanism of the Marketplace.  It's wrought with tension that IMO is much better than Louis XIV or Mykerinos.  The tactical planning of routes and costs of moving & selling are subtle but very important - because you do so many of them in the game, all these pennies & nickels add up towards your final score.  Almost everything you do involves the bottom line.  The valuations involving the Price Chart scoring and end game bonus scorings should not be overlooked either (Price Chart definitely takes priority).  In fact, I could see other boards being developed for this game system (just like Hacienda) and I would love to see a real life town or city map used in future expansion(s).  But I wouldn't recommend playing with analysis paralysis players.

The market is really quite central to how the rest of the game will play out for you - which also has an interesting bid mechanism using 4 "traders".  I now understand why there is the option to pay $2 to take a tile as the influence game can really get out of control in a hurry.  This is another typical Ornella game in which the game's mechanisms are tightly interwoven with many different ways to score.

Hermagor contains a neat little market side game to play that sets up the actual round. You can try to set up for points in the market but usually you are going to come out pretty much even there.

After two plays I can sincerely say that I don't like this game. The theme is a ridiculous paste-on (badly done), the movement phase is almost completely automatic (and thus extremely boring), the only interesting part is the market ... well and I don't like it's mechanism. If you are first you have a big disadvantage. Furthermore it can easlily happen that you get very few tiles, and then the game is over for you, since you will be skipping sales and it is very difficult to catch up. The game also includes lots of gamey mechanisms in play as in scoring, and I fail to see their justification. This is so not my game!

Played only once. Rather fiddly and much longer than I had expected, but still a very pleasant game. I like what you have to do in the game (get goods in the market, then travel and sell your goods). Rating may go up if we manage to turn this into a 90-minute game, likely to go down if we don't manage that.
First-time players shouldn't play this with 5 players, as it's easy to completely miss the boat in some rounds and of course it makes the game longer.

A hybrid game of majority, placement, management, course with a board that become illisible during the game with all the house on a city that is hidding the ressource symbol.  The resource to deliver in the city are strange like skull, carrot, egg, cross, etc.
A lot of possible strategies or tactics can be done during the majority phase, travel phase, may be too much that it make it difficult to really optimize it.  Difficult to see who is ahead since we can see the score only at the end of the game

RATING: 8
This game feels somewhat like Elfenland.
Like in Elfenland, you have to find an optimal route through a number of cities. Moreover, you can only travel over certain paths, depending on the resources you have collected. The only difference here is that the resources do not dictate over which roads you can move, but rather which cities you can effectively visit.
In Hermagor, the roads have different costs (you have to pay money to travel). In Elfenland, roads also have different costs (you have to pay in cards that have different value).
The travel principle in both games is the same, though.

I Liked Elfenland, but it felt a little too light. Almost always, more than one player managed to visit all twenty cities. And even when we used the optional rule for ending as close as possible to an 'end town', the game ended in a dissapointing draw.
In Hermagor this will never be the case. The scoring mechanism is much more fine-grained; the difference between 139 and 140 is still 1.

But enough about Elfenland. Hermagor has something new: the way in which to resources are auctioned on the market. I've never seen this auction mechanism in a game before, although it vaguely resembles Roulette. There too, you can bet for one number or spread your chances over two or even four numbers. The same holds for the market in Hermagor, and it really makes this game special and worthwhile playing!

Purchased new Sept 18, 2008

First playing was with 3.  You know...I thought I was going to like it but it gave me that same feeling Elfenland does. That..."Crap! We're laying 5 huts this round and now I'm screwed because I didn't get the amulet thing (purple gyroscope?)" 

Another player got some early money and man...it just seemed to only go downhill for everybody else at that point.  

The game is a mishmash of several little subgames, an area control game in the market coupled with an Elfenland/Thurn & Taxis village traversal. Bolt on an economic mechanic to adjust the price of tea in China and then a smattering of end game scoring features from, well...China and you get a feeling of what it's like. 

I'm not a hater of the game but my first playing was less than satisfying.

A thinking man's Thurn and Taxis. By bidding on goods in the market portion of the game you are essentially bidding on destinations - as if the cards in T and T were auctioned off. The movement portion of the round is also similar to T and T - you score points for completing trade routes.

This is not a bad game, but way too fiddly. The combination of VPs scored through cash, area completion, road length, price fixing, prestige and all the other baggage just makes it a little over-complicated. There's worker placement, a form of area control (though multiple players can surround the same area) and good old-fashioned tile shuffling. It reminds me of Planet Steam for some reason - like a bunch of mini-games brought together into a whole that's neither intuitive nor cohesive. It's almost like playing all the games in a compendium at once. Essentially, there are two parts to the game - a tile 'market' and a map on which you sell, but it feels much more bitty than that.

This summary sounds like I didn't like it, which isn't the case. I found it interesting, but it didn't quite deliver on its table time. I'd play it if others wanted, but I'd not choose it myself.

Didn't do much for me.  The market phase was kind of interesting, but thematically, the game was really weird.  Why do I get money for having buyers in a line?  Why does the bank pay to use another persons tent, and not the player using it?  Why is there no chance to 'block out' other tents?  Why do prices only rise?  Why can I sell at a place only once, but everyone else can sell there once as well?  The 'relic' source is a graveyard?  Churches selling blessings?  Dragon eggs?  Just a weird mishmash to me, and for the most part, nobody cared what other people did in their turn after the market.  Some weird art as well.  Guess you could say it did not grab me.

The meat of this game is in the marketplace where players "pay" to control sectors which produce action tiles.  The tiles are used to place markets on the board where there are a number of connection goals to consider.  Closing out an area on the board provides entrance onto a stock board where the majority of the end of game scoring takes place.  Don't let the 30 mechanics scare you, somehow they fit together nicely although at times it can be difficult to grok the cost-benifits of a particular tile.  The tile draw in a 3-player game can be frustrating at times as you could need specific goods to come up in order to close out sections you're working on.  It's one of those games where I felt that I could play much better if more time was spent on the decision making but at that point it's just a number-crunching game.

RATING: 7
A wonderfully heavier alternative to the transportation/visit games like Thurn & Taxis.  Best part: the "market" auction block to bid for trade goods -- adds soooo much competition.  Near the end the points pile up, too, as people jockey for position.  It plays very much as a step up from Thurn & Taxis and Elfenland, but that's a good thing!  Poo-poo on the poorly pasted-on dragon fantasy theme.

Az igazi munkáslehelyezős, kereskedős-gazdálkodós klasszikus Ornella. 2006-ban (amikor megjelent), biztosan a legjobb kereskedős-gazdasági játékok között volt, bő tíz évvel később nyilván vannak már jobbak.

Viszont! A játék remek, gyakorlatilag három táblán játszunk (egy piac, egy térkép, egy segédtábla), folyamatosan optimalizálunk, figyeljük a többi játékost, haszonmaximalizáló varázsigéket mormolunk és marhára büszkék vagyunk, ha dől a lé.

A játékban kereskedőket alakítunk, akik a piacról beszerzett áruikat viszik a szélrózsa minden irányába a helyi falvakba eladni, természetesen minél nagyobb hasznot harácsolva. Az utazásnak azonban költsége van, cserébe viszont van ráhatásunk az árak növelésére és igen sok kombináció esetén juthatunk extra bevételekhez. Meglepő, de akár már a piacnál is lehet kaszálni, később meg a térképen is sokat számít, mit melyik faluban sikerült eladnunk, mert ügyes (előre) tervezés esetén szép summákat lehet nyúlni a banktól egy-egy régió "bekerítésével".

Ötletes még a végén az extra bevételekhez jutás (=játék végi pontszámítás, csak ugye itt magasról tojik mindenki a pontokra, az egyetlen érték a pénz), három teljesen különböző feltételt kell vizsgálni. Annyi mindenre kell egyébként is a játék közben figyelni, hogy szinte lehetetlen az optimális megoldást választani. Megpróbálni persze meg lehet (vigyázat, AP veszély!).

Egyetlen hátránya, hogy helyenként vontatottnak éreztem és kicsit kimerítő két órán keresztül folyamatosan optimumokat számolni, olykor újra a főiskolai operációkutatás szigorlaton éreztem magam... Ja, meg nem is túl szép, bár nekem sok bajom nincs a komor hangulatú barna árnyalatok mögé tervezett (értsd: k.rva ronda) játékokkal.

Szóval klasszikus, érdemes kipróbálni.

It has a lot of elements - area enclosure, route building, auction, worker placement and commodity speculation. The market is pretty clever as there's a lot to consider where to place your merchant. Travelling to sell goods is very boring though. There are many decisions to be made in the game, but they aren't closely connected; you can get screwed by players later in turn order, it's hard to predict which goods to score when you enclose your area at the start. Route-building is semi-random, the math of income doesn't make much sense, there is no sense of progression, just optimization, and most importantly, because of the loosely connected mechanics, it appears that what you do might not have possibly affect the outcomes. You are trying to haggle over lots of small transaction to gain an edge. 

I wish to love this game as I like complex economic games, but it seems to be too chaotic for my taste.

Finally got to play this one!! I really enjoyed the theme and gameplay here. Nice marketplace where half of the action in the game occurs....fun placement competition with some unique rules that work well...then onto the town and scoring which also works well, I found. Can be a little harsh at times but tends to balance out and our 5 player game ended up being all pretty close.

The market seems to be the dominant aspect of the game, often involving tough competition for certain tiles, particularly if one or more commodities happen to be rare. There is relatively little player interaction in the trading phase as you cannot prevent opponents travelling and trading wherever they wish, although the order in which scoring combinations are achieved affects their value. However determining the best path in the final rounds can be challenging, especially if you do not get all the tiles you want from the market.

It's a neat and well designed game that had the unfortunate nature to really peeve me. The reasons why?

1. You have no control over where you're going in the turn order. Whoever has the least cash determines it.

2. Turn order can be crucial in picking the tokens that you need to allow you to sell / build huts. But you don't have control over it.

3. Accidental screwage is rampant. If 2 players both have their routes planned so as they both require a certain token unknown to each other), and both compete for that token, there's not enough auction turns for the inevitable loser (as dictated by turn order in the main) to come up with a viable alternative, so their round can be totally messed around. And there's only 4 rounds. Players not accidentally screwed are very pleased because they get their tokens easily and cheaply, not being in a bidding war.

4. If you're bid out of what you need and you move to plan B (if possible as other good tokens are likely already bid for), it requires significant down-time to look for a viable plan B or even a plan C. Then you're working out what the chances are that other people are going to need the tiles you now wish to bid for. More down-time. The downtime is just killing, especially as the game is only round-by-round tactics, little strategy
(other than to end your turn somewhere useful in preparation for next round).

Lack of control over a key component, accidental screwage, killer down-time. Shame, because it's actually a neat game other than for these.

One of the best new strategy games I have played in a while. Lots of thought, but plays fast with little down time. There are two different parts to the game, the tile selection is where most of the battle takes place, but the points (money) are mainly achieved on the map. All in all, a great game.

This game shines as a tactical brain-burner, but doesn't have much in the way of long-term strategy.  The "auction" mechanic is very clever and can lead to some tense moments.  As for the delivery aspect of the game, comparisons to Elfenland are apt.

RATING: 7
A very fine game, sort of an Elfenland on massive steroids.  The auction mechanic is very tense as each player sacrifices diversity for specialization.  Different things are important in different rounds, and every once in a while a battle for a specific commodity gets pretty intense.  A very strategic game with various ways of amassing VPs leading to victory.  A wasted round is critically damaging.  Fun and tense.

The only issues are that it's tricky to keep track of when a region is closed, the fonts to determine the start player for the round is difficult to read, and the handing out of $1 for everyone in a market is a bit of a pain.  It does take between 1.5 and 2 hours, as some AP rears its head in the auctions. Rating based on one play.

Excellent game.  The rules are very intuitive and while there is downtime between turns it is limited by almost constant player interaction.  Similary to Il Principe, many different mechanisms are melded together into a beautiful game with subtle strategies that I am not even close to mastering.

RATING: 7
Interesting blend of mechanics. Tons of information on the board, and always multiple factors to guide your decisions. Normally I'm not very fond of games where you're simply trying to calculate the option that maximizes points or money, but in Hermagor there's plenty going on and the money is the glue that holds it all together.

The puzzle-solving route-planning bit is only part of the game. The other, biggest part, is an interesting and interactive fight for tiles. And the two parts are interconnected: Will you fight for a tile that gives you the best route, or do you try to find a less profitable route that only uses tiles you can get cheaply and easily?

The game feels somewhat unnecessarily heavy, because of the number of mechanisms and scoring options. These pull you in different directions, which hides the fact that a large part of the game can be calculated and optimized. The market mechanism is cool, but I fear it might not be interactive enough to keep Hermagor interesting after repeated plays. The optimum strategy might be to interact as little as possible with other players, which does not make for a good game.

Despite this, I like Hermagor. Lots of little choices where you can gain a small advantage over your opponents, so it's constantly engaging. Not one to play with the AP-prone, though.

One play.
This one was a b-day gift from 2 geek buddies (Thanks, guys!).
I never would have bought this on my own, 'cause it looks, well, unapealing.

Then I read the rules. Six times. After the 5th time through I was starting to get the gist of it, but I was worried that this was going to be a long, painful, and dull experience. 

Lesson learned: Don't judge a game by it's box (or its rule book). 

The game isn't all that complicated once you play through one round. The 3 phases work well together, and there was lots of tension in the market phase. We did get one rule wrong (we rotated the start player), but in a game like this, you're bound to screw up the rules for the first few plays. 

If you like medium-heavy games like Puerto Rico or Goa, you NEED to buy this game.

An interesting euro game, but it felt a bit too abstract for my liking.

Two phases per turn for 5 turns.  The market phase is for acquiring types of goods for trade and is very abstract in game play.  It is also too easy to end up with very little for the next phase.  The goods selling phase involves travelling around the map to selling locations of the goods acquired in phase one.

To play reasonably well requires a lot of thought sorting out the abstract puzzle of what to do, and having a bad market phase can put a big constraint on the rest of that turn.

Liked the bidding phase - where you position your markers as bids on one to several tiles. Nice balance - the more you bid on the "weaker" the bid. It has a good balance to money you need to spend.
 
The map phase where you visit and cash in the resources you bought earlier at the various towns/cities ala Elfenland didn't seem anywhere near as interesting.

Was put off by the presentation of the game, the map art, rules presentation ....

There's a LOT going on here, loads of tough decisions and player interaction, very little chance and what there is affects all players fairly equally.  There are places in the game where you spend a lot of time waiting for other players to make their (tough) decisions, so if you don't like that, you might find this game too slow for you.  I didn't feel it was a big problem for me, though.  My rating might easily go up a point or more on more plays.

Area majority with no second place followed by mathy tactical pick-up-and-deliver.  No strategic arc; just optimize profit each turn and respond to obvious set collection incentives.

Rating after four or five plays.  Seemingly two games grafted together (the marketplace, "influence a tile" game and the travel/area majority board portion).

I've enjoyed this more as I've gotten to play it more.

There's some good things going for this game. For example the area majority system to buy the tiles is nice. In the end it's just too fiddly and too many things are triggered by a single action. Also the scoring is too cumbersome with too many elements and pasted on system for end scoring. This is a mish-mash of mechanisms reminiscent to author's other game: Il Principe.

One of the better games of 2006. The rules are very easy to understand and it plays very smoothly as well. Reminds me slightly of an advanced form of Thurn und Taxis (you know, without the cards and stuff), with a dash of Goa thrown in (best poor comparison to the market system I can come up with). It's not a terrifically deep game, but it does make you think and plan your turn without triggering too much brain burn or downtime. Decisions have to be made and other players have to be interacted with... a lot! Lovely. Just one thing I don't understand - why the fantasy theme and abstract board? Theme-wise the game would have really and truly benefited from a creatively realistic board (like Thurn und Taxis), with names for the towns by which players could better refer to them. Please can we have an official creatively realistic expansion board!? Please.

A lot of moving parts in this game. You play for majorities in a turn-by-turn manner with 4 pieces, but have to decide between spreading out and focusing, and also need to get your pieces into alignments. All in order to obtain special powers for tha selling (or building) rounds. There, you position for immediate and long-term benefits with a little bit of timing and horse-betting involved. But the game is won or lost in the market.

The multitude of factors involved meant it was a headache trying to keep track of what others wanted in my first game. It was hard enough trying to plan for myself. Some good ideas here, but it runs the danger of trying to accomplish too much, with throwaway tuck-ins like the market alignments and arbitrary end-game scoring threatening to dilute the speculative/timing component, which is more interesting to me.

I feel like Mykerinos presents the same ideas (turn-by-turn fights for majority, immediate vs. end-game speculative values scoring) in a much cleaner, more elegant way, and in half the game-time. Not sure if the added heaviness of Hermagor is worth it yet.

Hermagor -- Played once; four-player.

[q=Domcrap]"Wow, I am surprised this is rated so high! This game could be a 7 if it did not get bogged down in endless accounting. Playing banker is a full-time job. I just did the math and the banker has to pay out about 300 times in a 5 player game! In the end, all of the $1 transactions pretty much cancel each other out and have VERY little effect on the outcome of the game.

"In the selling part of the game, almost all of your mental energy will be spent trying to figure out what all of your options are, instead of choosing between them. Once you've figured out how much you make with the various options, you simply choose the best one. Never once do you have to make a judgement. This is not how I like to spend my free time."[/q]

I enjoyed this game, but I also agree with Dom.  In fact, there are a lot of games which fit Dom's description.  "...almost all of your mental energy will be spent trying to figure out what all of your options are, instead of choosing between them. Once you've figured out how much you make with the various options, you simply choose the best one."  This is why I've become so cautious about buying without trying.  

I know.  I know.  I've got several hundred games, so I certainly don't appear to have exercised caution.  But actually my purchasing has slacked way off in the past couple years.

The first thing I said when the rules explanation was done - "this game has at least one too many systems". Sure enough, the kitchen-sink design felt sloppy. The auction mechanic is interesting but brutal to the start and even second in order player. Turn order is so devastating that it should be really be forced to be spread around.

In essence, the really ugly, dark and confusing board is a means of rushing through the market placement phase after the auction.

I managed to manipulate and screw people out of things by dominanting turn order the last two rounds (since it is pretty easy to keep ensuring you have it) and won but it wasn't much fun.

RATING: 5
For a game with many decisions and different ways to earn money it all seems to boil down to one fact.  Trade all the time.  Never pass.  The lack of a viable conservationist strategy really detracts from this game.  It makes it one sided, trade like crazy or get left behind.  Also, it borrows most of it's mechanics from other games.  Pieces of Australia, Ra, Elfenland are there, and I'm sure there's more.  I think the merchantile phase is original and it's certainly fun and interesting, but it's about the only part that I felt really excelled.  Boils down to mediocre.

*update* on another attempt I find this game less interesting.  Apart from the merchantile phase, the game is just an excercise in wasting time because of lack of choice/strategy.  At least two thirds of game time is largely worthless, even if it's your turn.  Not much fun to be had here.

Against better judgement I rather like this game.  There is a ton of elements to consider, but it all remains somewhat managable as there usually is only so much you can actually do on your turn.  The delivery system feels somewhere between Elfenland & Thurn and Taxis. I feel this system is rather more engaging than the two of them, as the race to place your factories comes from how you plan your route, but the cost increases dramatically if you don't plan for an out. 

The market is really the heart of this game, this is a really wonderfully brutal and interactive auction system, that in my mind bears no resemblance to anything I'd seen before.  This part of the game is perhaps the most exciting, yet can also be rather frustrating as you can seriously get crippled based on the whimsey of others.

Thematically, I think this sucks.  The fantasy world only detracts from the game, and the art is chunky, digitized and while not entirely unclear, makes the board feel messy and unfinished.  I have to take .5 off my rating for that guy with the awful helmet.

The brutal market and the pensive planning make for long games with some serious downtime.  I don't think that I'd want to play this with more than three players.

This game isn't elegant, but don't think that because of its cludgyness it doesn't operate smoothly.  Quite the contrary, it just feels like it is a mishmash of mechanics that somehow work nicely with each other.  Like an unsanded, unfinished yet beautifully carved armoire.

A lot of different mechanics going on here but nothing we have not really seen before: Route building with bonuses for area control (think Thurn & Taxi), market control for goods tiles (think Keythedral) and a goods valuation track (I know I have seen this before...). In addition, there is also some special victory conditions with most houses along main road and award for most of the least (think T&E). That said, its a decent Euro with a weird fantasy / medieval theme literally pasted on. I love all the wooden pieces and the tiles are high quality but the board is less than desirable. Just not telegraphic. Played the first game with three players and it seems more a game for four players. I would definitely like to play again before making a firm ruling on this one.

Not bad. The market mechanism is pretty good but the circuit completion / goods delivery section was a tad pedestrian. It's losing a point or two for the painfully depressing colour scheme as well.

One concern is the amount of paper flying around. We played with 5 which adds up to 16 transactions with the bank in the marketplace and another 17 whilst travelling the board, a grand total of 165 in what is supposed to be a 90 minute game. Don't sit near the bank...!

A bit of travelling-salesman game, not unlike Elfenland or Thurn & Taxis. My main gripe with Hermagor is that almost everything you do, costs you money or gives you some small amount. So you're constantly doing these little sums inside your head, which detracts from gameplay. It sure has nice parts, but I would like to see a better focus and a tighter game. There, Thurn & Taxis delivers so much more. 

The butt-ugly brown board doesn't help either.

I quite like this well-balanced game with its interesting market phase, and deliveries.  The game is highly thematic, and really the only thing it lacks is some tension.  there is plenty of player interaction in the market phase, but it does not have you sweating out a decision in the same way say an 18xx buying round might.  It also suffer *a little* from a analysis paralysis aspect--primarily amongst the last two buyers in the market phase where optimizing placement is necessary.

The game shines in that it can reward risk-taking but it also rewards conservative play. 

One of the keys to winning is the optimum use of the short-cut tile, and as such it won't do to wait until the last turn to try and buy it.  It may well also behoove you to buy it in the second or thrid turn to prevent another player from making maximum use of it--if someone develops primarily 1 duchy to start--watch out they'll try and get the shortcut in the third turn, and be able to develop big in the 3rd and 4th turn.

Average game.  A lot of people seem to be really impressed with the bidding, but I found it to be merely adequate.  The route building, at least with 3, was far from competitive.  The scoring is all done with money, but it is hidden throughout the game.  The game seems to be about fully maximizing each move, but it is hard to tell how you are doing, so you cannot tell how well you are maximizing.  It also felt a little long for what it was.  I might try it again with 4 but not with 3.

The fantasy theme and gloomy artwork did nothing for me, but the game itself was great. Each round involves a tense, novel, auction for goods followed by travelling through the countryside placing houses to earn cash & end-game VPs. A lot of interacting mechanisms, but here they seem to work well. Set up more than one bank - there's a lot of money flowing back & forth.

I bought this after seeing it get good ratings from the local group of folks. After playing it, I'm not sure what the big deal is.

In fact, I kept thinking this felt a lot like Thurn and Taxis.

This game contains a nice blend of mechanics.  I really like the auction step in which players are fighting for majorities for the goods that they want, but they have to weigh the effects of guaranteeing tiles against making money.  Excellent stuff.  Then the selling phase contains mixtures of surrounding areas, travelling salesman issues, and spreading out amongst the whole map.  Good game.

Reminds quite a lot of Elfenland which I think is the better game - at least with the Elfengold expansion. Hermagor is a decent game but doesn't get any plays - they all go to Elfenland.

RATING: 7
I suspect its not going to rise above the level of "very good" in my book. This is, nevertheless, a very solid game. The bidding mechanic is delightfully frustrating, suitably novel and terribly (wonderfully) cutthroat. There's enough going on in the pick-up-and-deliver portion of the board play to keep things interesting, but this feels much less tense and innovative than the bidding system. Terrible color and graphics and a thin theme that fails to unify the experience are the biggest items detracting from a game that otherwise has a lot going for it. Experienced players have the ability to totally, absolutely and in all other ways hose the player going first in placement of bid markers, to the point of taking them completely out of contention, which also is a downside in terms of balance. Still ... I keep saying "yes" when someone suggests this!

RATING: 6
When Elfenland fans grow up, they want to play Hermagor.  By layering in a magnificent bidding mechanism (later stripped out to form Charon), the designer has created one of the most challenging route building games.  The presentation is deceptively friendly, and the gameplay is challenging and ultimately, unforgiving.  Hermagor is a solid game that exceeds my capacity to enjoy it.

Hermagor is the type of game that I love and that I'm absolutely horrible at.  There's an area control auction phase where you place four pawns to try and claim various tiles for the round.  Placing in better spots tends to cost more and placing in relation to where you've already placed gets you money for the round.  Then you can move around the board, paying travel costs, and selling the goods that you won in the auction.  A big part of the game, the one I failed at horribly, is completing sales routes in a region which allows you to claim a bonus for that area.  It's a lot of thinky, which I love, but fail spectacularly at.  Everyone else in the game almost doubled my score.  :)

Odd mixture, this one.  The move, build houses, surround areas part feels like I've seen it all before, although it's solidly executed - just not that exciting.  The market and commodity / production prices are a lot more interesting - while it's sort of an auction for the tiles, the cost of the various spaces versus the influence they give you in winning the tiles versus the cash bonus for rows and columns fill it with tense decisions.

The art is a mix too - the board is quite attractive, but at the same time quite hard to read.  Some of the tiles have brown text on a brown background, and the cursive font used in the instructions is all but unreadable.  Knock a point off if you plan on playing with less than bright fluorescent / sunlight, it's genuinely a bit of a strain.

Even though the rules fit on only four pages, their very tiny font and convoluted/labyrinthine organization made it difficult to teach the game never having learned from a player who knew it. Still, after we trudged through the learning phase, the game ended up being both interesting and easy to play, with a lot of choices and much inter-player conflict.  This will surely be played many times, with the intent of teaching many players. There are many ways to affect your score!! The most fun part of the game is the market, placing bits to capture the tiles you need to sell in the next phase of the game. You can't always get what you want!

Essen 06 Radar - I played an early copy of this at the WBC.  It definately has some good elements, especially the market, but it seemed like there were some excesive elements.  I look forward to trying it again, but I can't help but feel like it would have been better if it was paired down a bit more.

Played it again, and my impression remains.  There is just too much going on.  It just doesn't need 15 ways to get bonus score on the map.

Not bad, but I dislike the accidental screwage of the Market - in order to fight for the tile I need, I will affect other tiles that have just happened to be placed adjacent.  And the Market is the key part of the game, where anyone prone to AP (me!) is going to slow things right down.  I like Ornella's previous work, Oltremare and Il Principe, and would rather play those.

I rather enjoyed this game.  It has a little bit of everything in it.  Unfortunately there is some of the don't compete and win strategy to it.  I thought I had been done in because another player decided to compete with me on a tile he could not win but the cost of winning basically sunk me because he kept fighting a losing battle.  Of course the cost of not winning would have sunk me as well.  In the end I the game was flexable enought that I was able to overcome this obstacle and still pull out a narrow win.  All in all a very enjoyable game.

(after 1 5p game)  WOW.   A lot of different choices in a single game.  Combines many mechanics and with 5 players felt a bit chaotic and crowded.   With so many choices it's unlikely you'll "get it all" on your first play.   Might want an egg timer or timer if you have slow game players because this one could bog down depending on the game group.   Enjoyable game that I would like to play again soon while rules are somewhat fresh.

In a distant land, many and many years ago, rose a big and wealthy city: its name, now forgotten by most, was Hermagor. Commerce was the source of its richness, because from all its territory countrymen, artisans and also adventurers brought to the city every kind of merchandise: weapons, ancient books, precious relics, and rare dragon eggs. In this city, you can buy and exchange everything. This made Hermagor famous and merchants came from afar to buy and sell all kinds of goods at the market. Some even undertook perilous adventures to acquire especially rare items. They criss-crossed this wealthy region, creating new paths and roads, adding markets to towns, but always with the aim to become the richest!

A little long and fiddly for my tastes but I could play this occasionally. 

Essentially a buying and selling game. There are a number of mechanisms within the game that let you alter the values of various commodities that might be of interest to you. There is also some stock holding elements with players trying to invest in the most valuable commodities. 

There are a number of economic games that are far more streamlined, thematic and quick to play. Puerto Rico certainly comes to mind.

I won, and I think I liked it, but I'm not entirely sure what I did that others didn't do that enabled me to win.  I really thought that I was doing poorly and ended up winning by 20 bucks.  It's one of those games where there are so many options, and so many things going on that I'm not sure how I won.  Kind of reminds me of Goa in that way, which has, over subsequent plays, become one of my favorites.  So, I have hope for this one that it will go up in rating.

This time, in a second play, I thought I had won and lost by a few dollars.  Again, I really don't know what happened.  Again, I had fun, but I'm not sure this one is going to become a classic for me.  Also, maybe a bit long.

the rules are honestly too long and the 2 players version requires even more efforts to be played. setup is quick enough, rhythm of game is good and after the first turn you understand what resource you want to increase in value and you understand where you want to go. money aren't a big problem but in the end they are VP and you can't spend as much as you want. there are a ton of ways to make money/VP and that is good but also somehow overwhelming. all in all, a very good game experience

Extremely poor graphics design coupled with a terrible rule-book are big deficits in a moderately interesting game. My problem with the game is that the initial auction seems to be most of the game. The route planning is seems much lighter and more automatic. Most of the meat of the game seems to be in determining turn order etc., and the deficit to losing out on a tile can be getting your plans trashed for the round without a fallback.

There are a lot to consider in Hermagor, almost too much for the casual gamers to enjoy.  While multiple paths to victory is a feature I personally like to see more of, but in this case I hesistate to call it a strength in the design.  Especially with the road and the region scoring, it feels as if they were tossed in as an afterthought to punish the unsuspecting and/or forgetful players.

The auction is definitely the most unique aspect to Hermagor.  It is also wildly chaotic.  I suspect with enough critical study of the board it's possible to make a fair guess as to who will go after what tiles, but that would bog down the game too much.  Therefore, sometimes you find yourself competing with several people for only a couple of resources; at other you would be left alone to have free reigns over them.

The interactions between what you win in the auction and what you can affect in the market as well as the board is interesting, albeit unbalanced.  At least for me I found it much more important to be able to get my pieces on the map to achieve the bonuses as quickly and as efficiently as possible, than the ability to change the value of a given commodity.  A poor design to be sure if certain paths to victory is given significantly more weight than others.

Even so, I enjoyed Hermagor enough the first time to warrant more plays in the future.  Just not sure how soon again.

Did not seem anything special when I read the rules, but this became a lot more interesting once you start.

Ornella's games always have some unique mechanics and this is probably my favorite.

The auction mechanism is multilayered and brilliant - it could have been a game all on its own, but as the distribution engine that drives Hermagor, it shines all the brighter.  The first time I played this game, I kept thinking about it all through the next game, as well.  Just superb!

Prone to analysis paralysis. 4(5) turns, 4 buyers per player, ~1min to set one buyer = total time to think at the market: 16min per player. Add the time spent on moving/selling actions (17-22 actions per player), bookkeeping etc. 120min is not enough... or then my friends & I are exceptionally slow.

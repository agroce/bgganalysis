Has got my prefered combat sytem. Very strategic. Theme is felt. Game tends to take long sessions to finish. Some bookeeping required. Artwork and components could have been better.

Like the idea of the fighting with cards. But the game adds to many unneccessary dice/rolling/random elements. Needs some re-work than could be a great game.

RATING: 8
A bit of a mixed bag, this one.

I enjoy it more than Vinci, but certainly less than Wallenstein.  On the plus side, I like the combat system and the multiple ways of scoring.  It can get quite tense and the maths of adding at the end of each scoring round, whilst not difficult, is enough to make it unsure who might just be sneaking it if it's close.  There are ways to block rampaging hoardes, though it's possible not to suss these too quickly at first play (Forts can force those holding loads of great cards to play less of them), and then there's ambushes!  You can do quite well with trade, but you can do better with measured aggression if you are in a good position for it.  The seas are valuable, but jealous eyes will cast their gaze there.  Luck can go against you (it took me 4 turns to take a neutral province that should take a max of two), but it's not the most important factor.  Like in most Empire games, being boxed into a corner is a very difficult.

On the negative side, it does play quite long (it's easy enough to shave one Turn off to help with that), the battles you're not in can get a bit monotonous after a while and the rules cards and board are not as good as they should be (though this does not affect the game too much).

Definitely worth playing many times, but not a classic.

My rating after a single page.  Not as complex of a game as I expected from Martin Wallace.  (That's a good thing)  the game moved along quickly and the battle resolution was somthing new for me and seemed pretty unique.  All in all, a nice civilization game on the medium end of the spectrum that's not really much of a dice fest.  I'd gladly play again and even consider adding it to my collection.

Great game. We played two x 3 player games in less than 4 hours first time out, so the game moves fast with 3-4 players. The game has a fair amount of luck involved but we still enjoyed it and are looking forward to playing with 4-5 players. Try the various play aids, clarifications and house rules available on the net. We thought these we of great help. The rules are bare bones and have some minor mistakes.

RATING: 6
interesting but time consuming battle resolution mechanic, irritatingly badly set cost to character chards giving way to very big randomness in card drawing, and what seems to me very badly thought out game setup... seems like it's really important to be first-second at this time...

in spite of all the above I enjoyed the game, and can see playing again.

RATING: 9
An under appreciated early war-euro classic by Martin Wallace. The beauty of this empire game is its relative simplicity and strong thematic feel. Starting with the choosing of asymmetrical starting military hands the game allows your empire to specialize and try different approaches to victory. For example you can concentrate on trading, or dominating the Mediterranean with naval forces, or building fortifications and artillery to defend them, or powerful land forces, etc. Your initial card choices dictate your strategic path due to the VP penalty for holding them, although they can be lost during combat or as one of your actions. Combat is exciting as both players compose 5 unit armies, with some troops having advantages against others. You get one action per turn and there is a lot to think about as combat is risky and easier but less rewarding options like trade are available. Recommended with 4-5 players.

I'm a huge Martin Wallace fan so I had to get my hands on this older offering. You'll recognize some of the mechanics from his later games and we did enjoy our 5 player game. The combat system is fairly random and tough for the attacker.

This game is Flawed Genius.It looks and feels good and Ive always enjoyed the interesting nature of the battles. Playing it 4 player was great fun initially but the end game drags and the last hour (it does take about 4 hours) I just wanted it tob over and didnt care who won. If it somewho could be sped up it could be a much better game

This Wallace game is fun, but once again Warfrog lets alot of mistakes taint this production. Never play with more than 4 players. The extra 34 actions makes for alot of down time. It may be best with just 3.

1/7/06 
 After my 4th play of this, I have decided to lower my rating and put it on the trade list!  two many fiddley rules add to the play time and give it a random feel. It is a shame that this game just isn't that good, because it has alot of unique mechanics and could have been great. Wallace's "Over the Top" influence taints this one. Board position favours the side positions too much because of the movement and conquesting rules. This hurts me to say because I'm a hugh Wallace fan!                                    
11/1/07: I've had a change of heart for this game. It may have its flaws but it is still a Wallace! I have a few tweaks and rule clarifications based on my own interpretations of the rules. This one is not for trade. "If it's not Wallace it's Crap!"

Empires of the Ancient World takes you back to the age of Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar. You control the destiny of your empire, building armies, annexing neutral provinces, trading across the Mediterranean, and fighting battles. The heart of the game is its innovative card combat system. Superb, full colour, cards allow the use of pikes, swordsmen, warbands, elephants, heavy cavalry, foot skirmishers, light horse, siege towers, artillery and galleys.

Special Cards allow you to develop military leaders, diplomats, traders and engineers. Battles are fast and furious, with victory going to the player who employs superior tactics. However, winning the game is not just about having the largest empire. Having the biggest army will cost you victory points, so you had better use your forces well!

If warfare is not to your taste then you can capture provinces through diplomacy, or trade your way to victory, by having the largest trade empire.

Empires of the Ancient World can be played by three, four, or five players. It takes between two and three hours to play and the rules, though a little more complex than the average German game, are straightforward and easy to remember once play starts.

Components

Empires of the Ancient World contains the following:

*	Rulebook (in English and German) 
*	Full colour mounted map 
*	110 Full colour cards 
*	250 wooden playing pieces 
*	dice 

Empires of the Ancient World was designed by Martin Wallace, with artwork by Peter Dennis, and is published by Warfrog Games.

FAQ:

Q: How does the fifth possible action, placing a control marker, work?
A: As an action a player may place a second (or third etc.) control marker in any province that he or she already controls. This helps defend against the random rebellion die roll, and against diplomacy (a successful diplomacy action only removes one control marker). It does not help defend against attack.

Q: Can a player save unused Trade Cubes in his Warehouse from turn-to-turn?
A: Yes

Q: If an Elephant is matched against an Artillery, and the Elephant rampages and the Artillery misses, what&#039;s the result?
A: Elephant rampages and loses the combat. 

Q: In the example, Light Horse automatically block each other. What about Foot Skirmisher vs Foot Skirmisher or Foot Skirmisher vs Archer?
A: The units negate each other - whether both are the same or one is a Foot Skirmisher and the other is an Archer.

Q: There are several cases where the cards conflict with the rules, e.g., Artillery hits Elephants on a 5 or 6 per the cards, but only on a 6 per the rules. Which are correct?
A: The cards are correct.

Q: One Available Army Foot Skirmisher is lacking a text box.
A: Simple layout error - text from the other Foot Skirmishers applies.

Q: Do Forts have any effect for the Defender when an opponent is trying to use a Diplomatic attack against a province?
A: No - the Fort changes hands in a successful Diplomatic attack. 

Latest Errata/Clarifications:

1. Cards - one foot skirmisher card lacks information, same effect/abilities as other foot skirmisher cards.

2. Foot Skirmishers and Archers - If a foot skirmisher or archer fails to either hit or block an opposing card then it automatically loses. the only exception to this is when foot skirmisher/archer meets another foot skirmisher/archer, in which case the combat is tied. Light Horse always defeat foot skirmishers and archers. Against cavalry they suffer a -1 die roll modifier. Either one foot skirmisher or one archer can be selected for use in sea combat. They have the same effect on sea as they do on land, i.e. you roll for effect.

3. Siege Towers - If the defender opts to use a fortification then siege towers can be used to either attack or defend, which they do so with a strength of 9. They count as Slow units.

4. Place Control Marker - Rules explaining this option are missing from the rules book. If a player selects this option then he simply places one of his control markers in any province or sea area that he already controls. The effect is to make it harder for a player to use diplomacy to capture the province/sea area, since an extra successful attempt would have to be made. It also protects against revolts, since one control marker is removed the province would remain controlled.

5. Diplomatic Attacks - If a player uses a diplomat to gain control of a province that also contains a fort then he takes control of the fort. Any trade blocks in the province remain there - diplomats do not plunder.

6. Artillery - If artillery is drawn against a foot skirmisher or archer in sea combat then roll for the artillery first. The target is regarded as being a galley. Treat the combat as if a siege combat, which means the artillery result overrides a skirmisher result.

RATING: 8
Another Martin Wallace Area conquest/influence game set in the ancient world. It uses the "pick an action" from a menu of possibilities that helps limit downtime. The best feature is the card system for combat, which is very clever and shows how cards can be effectively used for battle resolution. The game's slick combination of military "control" coupled with economic "influence" to determine player success (VPs) is cleverly handled. The rules can be somewhat frustrating and some of the "character" cards verge on being broken. The emphasis on control of the sea areas can make the action in some of the lesser land areas superfluous. Nonetheless, a great game - begging for a face lift and re-issue!

Good game, just not realy one of my favourites.
Edit (what´s the problem): Controll over the Mediteranean is very important. You can only get and keep it if you havew galleys. With some bad luck you don´t get them. Also: Not sure I like the combat system. I don´t think the game really captures the theme well.

RATING: 7.5
An underrated area-control/wargame/draft from Martin Wallace.  I really enjoy how players draft cards to use in their empires.  By choosing which advisors, military units, and facilities to draft, players can pick which path to victory they wish to persue (military or mercantile).  Later in the game you actually use the army cards you drafted to fight any battles you participate in.  A nice taste of deck constuction and poker.

EotAW is one of the few drafting/worker placement games where the game is more than just draft stuff, score stuff.

RATING: 6.5
Interesting little game, but not one likely to see a lot of play.  Some minor changes in the component design (like labelling each card fast/slow) would have helped speed the game along; with our tired brains we had to keep referring to the cheat sheet.

RATING: N/A
Empires de l'antiquité a pour cadre le monde méditerranéen entre 200 av. J.C. et 200 ap. J.C. Chaque joueur s'efforce, par la force mais aussi par le commerce, d'étendre l'influence de son empire a tout le monde connu. Le coeur du jeu est un systeme de cartes par lequel les joueurs décident de la stratégie de leurs armées, chaque type de cartes ayant ses forces et ses faiblesses. Ainsi, des lanciers seront efficaces face a la cavalerie, mais souffriront face a des fantassins armés d'épées. Mais les joueurs ne peuvent pas recruter que des hommes d'arme, ils peuvent aussi faire appel a des marchands pour développer leur commerce, a des ingénieurs pour batir des fortifications, a des diplomates pour influencer les provinces neutres.

Not enough connection to really tie what is happening 
in the game with any feel of reality. Player aids need
improvement in presentation.

I usually don't like battle card systems or guessing
games, and much of this works out to be just that. That
side works well enough I guess, and bothers me far less
than the more euro aspects.

Nice game with a lot of cool stuff, but seems like there might be some balance issues ... the trade blocks seem awfully weak, the sea areas much too important and valuable, and the battles get rather repetitive.

Preliminary review after one 3 player session. I thought it was fun but it's definitely the kind of game that's chaotic until players gain enough experience to mitigate the luck factor. Even so, it may have too much luck for my taste (e.g., it shouldn't take 6 turns to conquer a neutral territory). I do like the battle system but I didn't care for the mechanism that determines which units a player can purchase. It ends up dictating to the player which strategy to approach. For example, I wanted to pursue a strategy based on sea power, but instead of being allowed to spend resources on building up a navy, I had to wait for galleys to be drawn from the unit deck. Since said galleys were never forthcoming I was forced to build up armies instead.

Finally, I think this game probably needs at least 4 players to work.

An undercooked masterpiece.  I wish Wallace would revisit this game.

More thoughts:

Empires does so much right...so much! The battle resolution is wonderful, it's got a good system of overlapping cultural footprints (the trade cubes) and a nice, open map that brims with possibilities. However, nearly every element outside combat is critically underdeveloped. The trade cubes only really allow players to consolidate when they could have easily provided a completely different dimension of play--in fact, this is the biggest problem for me. As it is the game is clever but ultimately unremarkable. There are any number of light civ games that you could play that will give you all the same kicks. However, I feel like if Martin would have allowed the trade system to get a little more complicated he could have built something really wonderful but the spartan design aesthetic doesn't quite allow him to make that leap. 

Also, it's a little to long both at the level of turn and round. The victory point calculation seems tacked on and clumsy. 

That said, it's ripe for a good variant and I think some intrepid designer could easily build it into a worthwhile game. I thought about taking a whack at it but ended up selling my copy of a couple years back. I can't say I regret it all that much--there are so many other, more interesting early Wallace titles...like the criminally under-appreciated Perikles and Way out West.

Had this game and traded it. It has some very nice unique elements. I didn't think I would miss it but I did so I bought it again. If you like a reasonably fast multiplayer wargame this is a excellent candidate. It borrows some elements from a lot of other games but puts it all together quite well. Another game that seems to grow on you.

A very good light euro/wargame hybrid. It doesn't get a higher rating because the diplomat card is too powerful, and the combat gets a bit repetitive after a while....and because its a light euro/wargame hybrid...you could be playing a proper wargame instead! Enjoyable to dig out once in a while.

This was my first Martin Wallace game. I like the period and the North/South unit split. I love the card art & the whole card battle mechanic. It makes for great excitement. I'm a little concerned that a player's dominance of the Med for long enough can lead to a runaway victory and I don't like the Diplomat. I also wish that the Merchants could provide a more lasting presence. The game seems to finish just as it really gets interesting.

Plays: 2-5

The good news:
The game itself isn't very special, it's the combat-system that makes this game shine. First: work out a strategy and try to get the right troops in your army. Will it be a Phalanx army or a rampaging horde of cavalry? Next: put it to the test. Attack your opponent and hope for the best. The balancing system works very well: a mighty army costs lots of vp. So if your mighty army doesn't gain you lot's of new territory you're skrewed.

The bad news:
The rest of the game isn't very special. Basicly a simple empire-building game. Control of the seas is (too) vital for victory.

The verdict:
Man, I love the armies and the battles. If only the rest of the game was a bit more interesting, this could be a top-10 game.

Better than it gets credit for.  This game, like Princes of the Renaissance, excels because it pushes players into asymmetrical 'special powers'.  Rather than a forced pre-chosen mechanic, this specialization comes in the game organically - some will naturally become kings of the siege. other kings of the sea, and so forth.  Otherwise, not as devious as PotR.  The battle mechanic is different - encourage players not to spend a lot of time lovingly organizing their army.  Build your army smartly, but then pick your troops and mix 'em up. It's too long of a game to play as a light mind-reading kerfuffle.

Empires of the Ancient World is another of Wallace's semi-wargames. There are quite a few different avenues to pursue (combat, diplomacy, trading) with all of them having their advantages and disadvantages.

Combat uses a very primitive form of deck-building (choose 5 unit cards from your hand and put them in the order you like, with some restrictions). Combat resolution is pretty neat and basically deterministic in nature but there are so many units that require you to throw dice instead that the results can feel pretty random. At the same time the combat rules include many exceptions and special rules that make the simple concept seem arcane and complicated at the beginning. Having to refer to the rules during the game is quite common.

Certainly not the best of Wallace's games, and I feel that he used many of the same ideas for better effect in After the Flood (not the combat resolution, though), plus it's maybe a tad long with the amount of random factors in mind.

RATING: 6
Anno 2014 ein doch etwas arg rudimentärer, fast schon hölzener Wallace. Ein typisches Eroberungsspiel, wie man es von ihm kennt: Am Anfang gute Position sichern, dann schnell über die antike Welt des Mittelmeerraums ausdehnen, dann schleppende, stellungskriegartige, kaugummimässige Kriegsführung, die sich wenig dynamisch über den Spieleabend zieht. Der im Kern in seiner Einfachhheit sympathische Best-of-Five Kartenkampf-Mechanismus ist dabei zeitlich auch wenig förderlich. Die visuell spartanische Gestaltung lässt das Auge hungern.

RATING: 8
I really liked several of the mechanics of this game. The negative victory points for the powerful mercenary units and the trade cube mechanics were particularly nice. One negative was that multiple control counters in a territory did nothing to aid you in the event of combat. I felt that the additional control counters should allow you to add an additional card to you army or spot you one victory in the combat system so that the conquerer has to take more victories to have a chance to draw and eliminate a mercenary card. The ability to clear the list of available mercenary cards should cost either an action or a trade cube but not both. If it costs a cube but not an action you would use it at the beginning of your turn to change your potential selections. If it cost an action but no cube a player without a viable attack could use it to purge mercenaries available to his opponents. As it is it just doesn't get used very ofter.

I really like this civ-lite game.

POSITIVES

I particularly like the card driven combat system. Having more cards gives you an advantage - you have more options. However, how you deploy your cards (troops) is critical - Pike do well against cavalry but badly against sword etc. This makes battles quite thrilling, albeit a bit more random. Combat is multifaceted with sieges, sea battles and ambushes.

Trade element gives the game an extra interesting dimension.

You cannot have your last region taken and be eliminated from the game.

NEGATIVES

Many people think the Diplomat is too powerful and apply house rules to reduce its effectiveness - saying for example that he cannot be used against sea regions or fortified regions. I agree with this approach.  

There may be a tendency to gang up against the leader in this game.

It is a bit too long we simply reduced the number of turns.

the first time you pick the box up it looks quality.  the board, game cards and pieces are likewise excellent and put to shame alot of more expensive games.  The play is easy to learn and play a delight in fact.  I'm a historical table top wargamer, you know, painted fugures and I look at game for their use as campaign systems ans this game is ideal.  Play it and 'cherry pick' the battles to fight on the table top.  A top game and one very hard to come by now. I just bought mine unused off ebay... what a find.

It grew really old...

It's like refined Civilization by Tresham.  And Mare Nostrum and Conquest of the Empire look like refined versions of EotAW.
But MN and CotE feel like modern games and EotAW contains several **really** archaic mechanics and ideas.
  EotAW is also waaay too long.  It's several hours of play and you can feel every minute of this..

There are *great* ideas here like composing your armies and combat resoluton, but overall length of the game and archaic feeling make me not want it to try it again too willingfully..

To me, this is the ULTIMATE Ancient Empires game. I sold Conquest after I played this because there is no comparison. More complicated SPI games are gone too. This game has it ALL, DBA style armies, card play for simultaneous combat, nice packaging and RE-PLAYABILITY in spades. I picked up this game while in Berlin and it resembles a wargame more than the typical German game because it's half British. I wrote a nice little 2-player Punic Wars Variant for the game I might publish on the Geek when I get time.

After one play... with a few rules played wrong, I rate this game a '6.'

With only two diplomats in the deck, it seems that whoever gets them has a distinct advantage in expansion.  Diplomatic attacks seem too 'easy.'

The game seems fairly balanced and rewards early expansion, but it also has a LOT of down time.  If I were to play again, I'd shorten each of the four rounds by one or two actions each.

Empires is a civilization/conquest game along the lines of Antike. The board is a map of Europe and North Africa, divided along ancient provincial lines. Each area has a value which equals its point value and the limit on the number of trade cubes you can put there (ranges from 2 - 8). Expansion is primarily accomplished by military conquest. Each player has a base hand of military cards. This hand can be expanded by drawing additional cards from the face-up display. Most cards however have a point cost that affect you at every scoring, so you essentially pay for larger armies in victory points, which means you better be using them to expand or they are worse than useless. Combat is the most unique aspect of the game. Players each select 5 cards from their hands and create a 5 card draw pile. Players simultaneously draw each card, compare values and modifiers (some units match up better than against others). There are 3 battle tokens that start in a neutral box and move to one side or the other depending on each match up as it occurs. Whichever side ends up with the most tokens is the winner, with ties going to the defender. The game awards an agressive military approach, I think. In addition to control tokens, you also expand through trade tokens. A majority of trade tokens in an area nets you half the points - so in essence, there are almost two games happening simultaneously - 2/3 of the game is military control while the other 1/3 is majority placement.

Sounds pretty good, but the game has quite a few issues. It feels like an "early design" to be sure. The area values range too much. It takes much less energy to control an 8 point area than 4 2-point areas, even though the impact to the score is the same. Some areas of the board appear to be clearly superior to others. Some combats, especially against neutral territories, is too simple (a modified die roll), while the mini-draw deck combat takes a bit too long. This is a game that tends to have lots of house rules with different groups. The game certainly tempts you to make improvements to it. I bet with a best-of collection of house rules applied, it might be pretty darn good. However, not sure if I have the interest to find out for sure.

I'd rate this higher, but for now the high learning curve and the length of the game cuts it down a bit.   I really like it, but it's just so long and you end up refering to the rules a lot. 

I've played it only once but thought it had a nice balance of ways to win the game.  There is a decent amount of randomness in the game, but it seems to be part of the skill in winning is reacting in a decent way to these events.  I had an advantage of very good early placement which let me get the northwest portion of the map and sit on it.  I had very bad luck building up my army, so I just tried to maintain my borders but slowly switched to seeding trade cubes all around the board, mostly trying to avoid areas of conflict.  Towards the end of the game I was starting to lose area in battles but the trade cubes by then made up for my loss of land and I lost all my army that would have reduced my victory points.

I suspect that were I to play again I wouldn't fare quite as well if I tried to implement the same strategy.

Moved to a 3 after 2nd play. There is not much chance of me playing this again with out the involvment of naked supermodels at the table. 

After the opening placement this game is based on a series of rather random events to determine the winner. 

The choice of what units you can draft, the outcome of your battles and even movement is controled by a large amount of randomness. Add this to the fact that losing control of either the east or west board edge results in 0% chance of winning and you have what amounts to a 2+ hour waste of time. 

Not Mr Wallace's best game. 

we won't even go into the production errors in the game.

I have only played this once so my rating is very uninformed.  This is an interesting game where you set up a position in the Ancient Med venue.  The game has an interesting flavor with two types of scoring, owning a territory and having trading rights to it (marked by trading cubes).  The game becomes a treasure hunt after a while where the trading cubes attract invasions.  It's an interesting parallel.  The combat mechanism, however, feels a little fake.  Basically you play War with two decks of cards.  It's not just by rank, because different units affect other unit types differently, but the only positioning is placement in the deck.  It is an interesting mechanic, but not one I liked very much.  I did lose badly, so my experience may be colored by that.

03/05/06 Played a three player game. I like games that are a blending of wargame and Eurogame. The combat wasn't as tedious as I'd been led to believe from reading some reviewers comments. I look forward to playing it again. High production values except one thing. Why they didn't just print "fast" or "slow" on each card mystified me. I never would have guessed skirmishers and artillery are "fast" units. I'm glad we played with a cheat sheet. The military commander seemed of almost no use.

I really want this to be a good game, but I haven't found the sweet spot.  It is hard to influence the outcome of the battles, and the non-battle moves seem too strong.  Perhaps we have launched into combat too early in the game.

It would be nice if there were a two player variant.  Hard to drum up a third when I doubt the quality of the game.

The rule book contradicts itself, and omits critical information -- it is necessary to read in more than one language to get it right.

A fun although overlong (by about an hour) card-driven area control game where players have a number of options each turn including: attacking, diplomacy, building fortifications, drafting mercanaries and expanding trade routes.  The heart of the game is in the battle system where players choose 5 troops (cards) and their formation (actually order of play: it's 1 troop versus another) for battle.  Players can use a number of different strategies which are aided by their advisors; which can be drafted too: merchant, engineer, diplomat and military leader.  The design allows for a good narrative and I should warn that there is some luck (with dice throws for a few of the troops) involved.  However, I thought the dice were appropriate as these are ancient troop types and thematically their attacks would not always have been predictable.

Call me crazy, but I like it. It does not compare well with Wallace's latest games BUT it still very much has its own feel and tone.  The battle card mechanic is brilliant and would have been helped by different units in more different areas.  I'm not fond of the trade mechanic nor the Merchants nor the over-valued seas.  If a player gains control of the seas and then drafts all the good galleys, he is nigh-unassailable. This game needs some serious love in the form of a reprint and a rules scrub.  It has such potential.

RATING: 7.2
Nice game.  Should appeal to those who like risk.  Two forms of empire building, economic and military.  Card based combat, sort of a modified RPS.  Several cards give powers that can affect combat, winning is through straight VP.  Quite enjoyable, though it's about 3+ hours with 5 people, 2 with 3 people.   Problems are runaway leader if your battles don't go well (pick on the little guy a REALLY big issue), and beat up on the leader.  Opposites I know, but it's all due to the cards being played.  Loss of one major battle or a couple key cards transforms your position. Reccomended game though.

RATING: 5
VP-based area control game with combat and lots of dice-rolling to see if you've just wasted your turn or not.  Suffers from some unforgivable graphic design oversights and pales in comparison to similarly-themed games such as Vinci and Antike.  The card-based combat system is so impervious to meaningful strategy that you might as well resolve battles through a series of coin flips.  I really wanted to like this game, but won't be playing it again as it takes too long for what enjoyment it provides.

At first glance looks like a civ game, a bit like Antike, but it is much more wargamey. There seems like there might be a runaway leader problem; there is no penalty for overstretching your lands and the loss-of-units mechanism promotes the leader. Furthermore, the ability to take down anyone who shows weakness combined with a total inability to even chip away at a strong player promotes the taking down of the [i]second[/i] strongest player.

There are also some balance issues - trade is completely unviable as a sole means to victory. It's also [i]long[/i], although this may be a function of the group I played it with.

The best element is the RPS-style card combat, but even this suffers from balance issues. The 7-strength infantry seem  close to invincible, making this not so much rock-paper-scissors as "small rock and big rock". I also find it misleading that the only two combat strengths are 6 and 7.

Good strategy game with a nice balance of options.  Lots of direct conflict balanced nicely with a VP system that rewards having territory while making you pay for a large army/navy.  Good selection options for forces/special characters.

Combat's also nicely handled with a good range of options depending on where you fight, who's fighting, and what they hold.  Really adds flavor to the game in a nice, thematic way.

The Diplomat is a problematic figure in the game for 3 player games and a bit of an issue in 4 player games.  So it's worth thinking about leaving one or both of those out as the number of players shrinks.

Wallace's second Risk derivative. The game is fun but there is more randomness than in a standard Risk game. (Cards form the 'armies' and then are played blindly PLUS many cards require a die roll to determine their value!! A Warband may be worth 9 one time and only 4 the very next time.)  The R-P-S combat system is not an improvement over just tossing dice and actually lengthens the game. The game is fun on a beer and pretzels level.

A nice take on area-control.

Had some enjoyable mechanics.
The card based battle mechanic, where different troops are valuable against other kinds of troops. It causes each player to have a different field.

Nice balance between the VP's assigned for controlling territory and cost of having a larger army to support your position. The alternative scoring by using trade allows you to use another player's position to support your own.

Unlike later games, which seemed you always seemed limited on actions - this seems to have too many actions per round.

[Excellent condition, complete.]

Area influence and war. A lot like Web of Power, with two sets of influencing markers (influence tokens and trade blocks). Will take multiple plays to appreciate.

Card driven wargame with deck building and dice. Cards have strengths but also weaknesses, making relative use situational. Revolts add an element of risk (randomness?), albeit one that is difficult to mitigate given they are determined via dice rolls. In the action phase, players draw cards from a face-up display (recruitment), fortify their territories, apply control markers (influence, for VP scoring), spend trade markers (additional influence, a sort of currency in the game and used to perform diplomatic takeovers of neutral territories, replace the face-up recruitment cards, etc.), and fight. 

Battle involves each player secretly building a deck of 3-5 cards (while following some basic rules -- e.g. fast troops must be played before slow ones) before simultaneously revealing cards (some requiring dice rolls) one at a time in a tug of war for battle "blocks" that ultimately determines who wins and how many troops must be discarded on each side.

Nuances related to how the board is laid out, terrain challenges for fighting across water or mountains, the variety of cards, and the tradeoff between diplomacy and conflict make for plenty of strategy and depth.

--Oct2007-- The game is an interesting experience:  like many of Wallace's titles, there's a rather open set of options available to the player - and the ideal play is not immediately obvious to the inexperienced player.  In our first game, we saw quite a dramatic alteration of our understanding of the mechanics between the first turn and the last.  There are a bunch of random factors that might have detracted from the experience had we been more serious about the game: but as light war-game-ish fare it's pretty nice.

A clever game once you've got the hang of it. Certainly a player aide would be a good idea if a new edition was printed. I think the design has held up very well over the years. The combat system is a huge step up from traditional pure dice rolling - a nice mix of dice and cards. On the other hand there's a lot of die rolling for movement, of which about a third will not go your way if you're not prepared to spend a few cubes along the way.

With experienced players I'd expect the game to be self balancing. There's a lot of unknowns in the first game with regard to the value of everything and just generally how everything plays out. There'll be big battles expected in the fourth round.

The only issue I have with the game is that it runs a tad too long for my taste. I like the four turns, but perhaps each turn could be two rounds fewer than the previous one - everyone could start each turn with one less trade cube.

I could see myself happily playing this more (but with a little player aide to deal with the confusion I have with the unit types). The artwork is nice. The graphic design could be touched up a bit with slow/fast unit and seaworthy designations on the cards. I'd be in the queue for a new edition.

One of the first Wallace designs, in the vein of light multiplayer wargames [i]à la Risk[/i]. Better than this last, but there are a lot of better games of this kind, like [i]Antike[/i], just to mention one. The combat system is one of the best in the genre, with a lot of tension an a good dose of planning. In a way, it could be a precursor of deckbuilding games, even when the game has many other elements to consider.

This really should come out on the table more often.  The beginning of my love affair with Martin Wallace.  That man needs to hire a graphic artist and a copy editor.
Gameplay revolves around two axes: developing your army, and building a trade network.  It's easy to neglect one for the other.  It's also easy to forget how important the Med itself is, both for the points and for its geographic value.  While by no means a perfect game, most of its flaws are inherent in the genre (diplomacy/kingmakership).

The rules are much simpler than later Wallace games (Byzantium, Struggle of Empires) and the combat system seems easy enough.

Will attempt a game soon.

Update: A very playable euro-wargame. Wallace has created an elegant game system where players draft armies and expand (attack, diplomacy, trade) in order to control territories for VPs.

Turns zip along fairly briskly and the 'luck' factor that many talk about can be mitigated by prop drafting of troops and deciding what fights to pick. The battle system is clever (reminiscent of Slapshot!) and is quick to resolve.

Many Wallace games have die rolling and this one is certainly not the worst offender.

This certainly isn't the crown jewel of Wallace's ludography.  In fact it remains one of his weakest Warfrog releases, but that doesn't exclude this from being quality despite being a lesser effort.  There are many things to get frustrated with while playing this.  Mainly, some cards are just straight up better than others, so often taking a lesser card just allows for the advantage on the draft.  This can really get frustrating.  Perhaps you shouldn't replenish the cards after a draw, rather you must spend a cube to wipe and reset if you want more options.

The combat is a little silly, and more than a little random, but I there is a real sense of excitement as the battles reveal themselves.  I really like that you can pursuit a variety of strategies, either through "diplomacy", invasion & merchants.  You can focus on the valuable sea spaces or on land or siege battles.  There is a strange reward from losing good cards in that you don't have to pay for their upkeep.  This encourages attacks. The constraints on drafting from geography also encourage players to move as well.  Overall, there are a ton of neat bits to this.

Still, it boils down a little random, and frankly kind of silly.  As I was playing this, I was a bit confused, as I was challenged by the fact that this game is more fun than it is good.  A strange mix, but one that really works, as long as you don't take things seriously.

A shame that they couldn't have put more information on cards and on the map.  Don't play this without first printing out the play aids here on the geek.

UPDATE: The reality is that, while there are a lot of great ideas here, there are just better games like this.

It was fun to see the early origins of SoE and Byzantium in one of Wallace's first Warfrog entries but I am not so sure I need to play it again. Some really good mechanics going here but like a multi-player wargames it had a certain beat up on the leader syndrome. The battle mechanic is great and not at all rock paper scissors as some of the claims on the board may indicate.

RATING: 4
It seems too random for me. In the first few rounds it is key what cards happen to come up for you on your turn, and that determines a lot how you will do in the game. Also, like many games, a few bad rolls or match ups can decimate your army, leaving you sitting there dead for the last two hours of the game.

1 time played with 5. Too much luck driven game. Not that we don't like luck based games but this one seems like you can't have any influence and for the length it took it was just boring in the end. Also the manuel is just a plain horror. Maybe we might give it another chance with rule clarification and some house rules but I doubt I can anyone convience to play it again.

Played at Ghengis Con 2006; fun game, would play again, but seems too limited at what you can do.  Taking areas diplomatically is an option for a while, but you quickly run out of trade counters.  And then they are just taken back if you don't have a strong army.  The card combat works better than I thought it would.

Our old group had mixed feelings about this game - personally I loved it but then I may be biased since I shelled out the cash for it.

RATING: N/A
A weak rulebook keeps this one from a higher score. Card play becomes a bit tedious as the game moves along. Both a Euro and a Wargame, and a breeze to play, this design is still a success (if not somewhat dated).

A good mix of german and war game! Yuo need to like dices rolling, otherwise... I found myself a little bit disappointed about some rules (attack along all sea reagions and roll dice for sea movement), but I have no problem about changing something to improve my feeling with the game.

It takes a few turns to start understanding what needs to be done. Its tough with 5 players better designed for 4. 5th player always comes up short. Combat in the sea is tricky but if played with the  better galley cards you can win..Similar to risk but to win territories you need the better cards. The key is to remember your opponents cards after a few battles and in what order to place them down during combat.. Keeps my interest..

Not a bad game... but I'm not too fond of the card combat (rock-paper-etc..) It drags on too long as well. But it looks great and with 4 players I don't mind playing it.

This is a huge stinky piece of steamy gooey POO! I will NEVER play this again and would rather suffer dismemberment. STRATEGY: Set up on the edges and reduce the amount of chance... for this is the only time in the entire game which is free of luck. Pure luck fest!

I like it.  Not nearly the stuff of Martin Wallace's more recent games, but still an enjoyable game of conquest.  Yes, there is randomness, and quite a bit of it.  If you don't like that, don't play this.  I don't mind it too much, so it's a fun game for me.

Played once (with 5 players). My only play is quite old already, but I mainly remember a long game with some balance issues, but an interesting (if not very easy to control) battle system. I might be interested in giving it another try.

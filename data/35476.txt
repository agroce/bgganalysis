Highly recommended especially in conjunction with the other linked modules in the series. Beautiful maps and rules that model the difficulties of both the Germans and Russians in 1941 and early 1942.

I have played the first scenario and am playing the 2nd now.  I have read the rules twice due to time between plays and I am finding this system a little fiddly so far. There seems to be so many special rules for this situation or that.  I am spending more time looking in the rules than playing.  

Will have to see if it gets any easier. I would have wished they abstracted some things a little more in favour of ease of play.  I also get the feel that the rules don't explicitly tell you what you can do, but rather make you implicitly assume.  For example air combat, I assume that there is only one round unless you have local tactical advantage but I could find no where in the rules to state that there is only one round.  So hopefully I am playing it correctly.

I have read and read the naval rules and yet they are a mystery to me. I really wished they would have been more consistent with the word adjacent.  I also really would like to see some examples of naval activity.  

So far this series is not doing it for me.  If I wanted to play an Eastern Front game I would play GDW's Fire in the East.  It seems to be an easier system to understand.

Regardless I will play through the scenarios and see if the learning curve flattens at all and hopefully I can find a naval tutorial somewhere.  So until I have completed my playtesting I will rate this game a little on the low side as its not what I expected.

RATING: 6
2 plays of a short scenario (#9)
2 plays of a short campaign (#3)

Updated after fourth session  -----------------

While Crimea is more than a game about a set of sieges, it *is* primarily a game about sieges.  The most mobile scenarios often begin and/or end along fronts that are 5 or 6 hexes wide.  Only half the map area is land after all, and that land is full of peninsulas and narrow isthmuses.  The scenarios are better than I had expected, and this is an interesting game.  However, it is the least engaging member of the EFS family for my tastes.

------------------------------------

I'm a fan of the series, but almost passed on this title due to its lack of mobile units and perceived focus on siege warfare.

I'm glad I didn't.  After several solo plays of the Kerch-Feodosia Operation (scr 9) wherein the Soviets stage their biggest amphibious invasion of the war using scows, icebreakers, and a dredger, I'm playing the Axis in a FtF game of the "short campaign" Scr 3 and I'm really enjoying it.

True, this isn't AGN, you don't have armored spearheads driving for bridges hundreds of kilometers behind enemy lines ... but it's a good game.  For game purposes, Crimea is essentially an island, particularly for the Soviets who have to ship everything into the theater.  And the world has no "edges" - the whole playspace is there.  The Axis forces, which include only a few fast movers (including one of those motorcycle recon units I love), are about to kick the door in and the Soviets will have to scramble to pull back in good order.  But keeping them from doing so won't be easy, the door usually breaks right as the weather turns poor, limiting what little chance for real maneuver remained.

In many ways, the resulting game is the most balanced contest in the Series in that no one is running circles (literally) around their opponent.

Crimea's campaign is very approachable because of a low unit count, start conditions that are straight forward (attack fortified line) but branch into an manageable decision tree as the game matures (drive to Kerch or drive to Sevastopol).  However, these traits all limit replayability as you might imagine (I think I'll ... Assault the Fortified Line!).

Unfortunately, the title has issues despite the polished presentation.  The new naval rules work quite well, but could have been introduced much more clearly.  The rules are quite verbose and yet tricky to digest at the same time.  It's too bad, the naval system in EFS has been an Achilles heel and more attention should have been paid to putting the best foot forward.

Proofreading on the playbook and scenario cards was very poor.  Often victory point cities are spelled one way on a scenario card and another on the map.  In at least one case the scenario setup information in the playbook conflicts with a setup card (which is obviously right), and one card calls for a unit that isn't in the counter mix.  The playbook has several dangling sentences and words that passed spell check but were misused... you know the type.

The turn sequence summary on the back of the rulebook is missing one of the new stages related to naval readiness.  

However, the most serious error is in the complete omission of a special assessment of supply status that occurs only if air interdiction against a port is successful.  It is not mentioned in the rules at all, and if not used, aerial interdiction of ports has no impact on supply (and it should) because interdiction is marked after the supply determination phase and then removed before the next turn's supply determination phase.  This omission has been confirmed by the game's developer.

Bottom line, the gem has flaws that playtesting and proofreading should have caught.  Heck, I found most of these issue in the first read through the play book, or the first time I set up a scenario, and there's simply no excuse for customers finding such errors.  I've watched GMTs quality slipping the past few years, but thought that long running, well crafted series like EFS were above such problems.

Still, EFS is so fantastic that I recommend any fan of operational warfare give the in-print titles a try.  True, if you like mobile warfare, want to experience the vast distances and logistic problems of the Eastern Front, or simply want dynamic and replayable situations; Kiev to Rostov is a better starting point.

I am glad to have Crimea in my library, it is another chapter in a series I love.  It's just not the best written or most interesting chapter.

--------------------

update: this was the most expensive game I purchased in 2011 and the most disappointing.  Others were worse, but this title was the most disappointing

--------------------

I have docked the rating of all EFS titles a point due to their cumbersome, "old school" style rules.  I love the series, but the rules make it unnecessarily difficult to take the game off the shelf and convince my usual opponents or introduce newcomers to play.  It would be wonderful if this series had several people working on titles, and was producing new works more frequently, as OCS does for example.

The most extensive of the EFS Series to date in terms of range of scenarios, small and large. No Panzers in this one, but lots of everything else - Soviets have to manage ship-resupply to Sevastopol and plan their Amphibious landings later. Also contains a very interesting Odessa siege mini-scenario which links from where the AGS game ends.

RATING: 8
Another of the East Front Series and very different in that this is much more of an infantry slugfest and heavy artillery concentrations.  This game does a very good job of capturing the unique situation and problems associated with combat in an area that was treated as a secondary front by both sides.  Highly recommended for anyone interested in the Eastern Front.

Reading the rules, seems extremely fiddly. The ezoc rules alone are enough to irritate me, as it mixes MP costs to enter ezocs with other restrictions and exceptions, such as unit type, movement phase and weather, that will all be very difficult to remember. Ugh.

I just don't see the advantage of these sorts of movement rules over something as straightforward as the SCS ezoc rules which allow you to pass through ezocs at the cost of extra movement. With the movement rates for the armor and infantry set properly, it "just works" in terms of realistic game flow with a minimum of fuss.

Anyway, that's just for starters. I think it's going on the trade pile.

The EFS is a great system that accurately simulates the Nazi invasion of the USSR.  The system has excellent rules for combat, armored exploitation, terrain, and the typical things required for a wargame.  The drawbacks are that sometimes there seems to be a bit of rules bloat, in that you end up looking up a few too many obscure rules, and they aren't even chrome.

Crimea especially is a real infantry brawl.  Lots of infantry units smashing each other around with artillery playing the big support role rather than armor or air power.  The naval rules are a nice addition (considering the significance of the Black Sea Fleet), and the inset map for Fortress Sevastopol is really wonderful.  A nice enough way to learn the system, but maybe not the best way to experience the most exciting aspects of the Eastern Front.

RATING: N/A
Great intro to the EFS system for solitaire play.  The Soviets would have a rough time if played face-to-face - they do more backing up with less opportunity to hit back than in the rest of the series.  Naval rules are interesting but unfortunately do not port over to AGN - hoping we will see a consistent set adopted into the series rules with the AGN reprint.

The 6th in the East Front series!  I hope I can sometime conquer them all.  But first, GMT please reissue the Barbarossa: Army Group Center to complete my collection of the series!

The game arrives after 11 months from preorder date. At $55 pre-order price, it is a bit expensive for only one map but the package box comes in heavy.  Still in shrinkwrap to know why.  There is a separate half countersheet coming inside the box for the game and I guess it is some kind of errata counters.

Although the mechanisms seem daunting at first, they become ingrained pretty quickly. The only part I think doesn't work as smoothly is the supply, which can't make up its mind if it's trying to model actual supply or transport capacity. The earlier games in the series look quite dated compared to the most recent ones. Interesting to compare to OCS, which is at exactly the same scale. Very different games, and it's interesting where they place their focus.

Playing campaign game (scenario 5)

A lot of new rules (naval units, amphibious assaults, inset map, etc...)which make the game more complicated.

There is far less movement and units than in the previous modules but there are some hard strategic choices to do.

The East Front System continues to improve with the latest installment on the fighting in the Crimea.  Color rulebooks, nine scenarios and a campaign, updated naval rules(almost a game by itself), and you certainly can't complain that you don't get enough stuff in the box!  Interesting scenarios from the breakout into the Crimea, the siege of Sevastopol, Russian counterattacks, and more.

Preordered. I've gone over it a few times and am currently obsessing over it. I'm putting together a Vassal module.

I've fiddled around with the first scenario, starting to get a feel for the flow of turns. If it lives up to my excitement over it, the rating will go up as I get some real time in with it.

Great game on the WW2 fighting in Crimea. Nine really good scenarios including an update to the Odessa scenario that was in Army Group South.

The game can be added to the other games in the series to create even more action on the Eastern Front.

I do really enjoy monster war games, I have even played once Army Group Center from this series of games. Whenever GMT Games offers a game in this series I have bought it, the problem being this game and Barbarossa Kiev to Rostov, 1941 are the only two you can buy. Of the two this game I think works better as a stand alone. GMT Games is supposed to be re-printing Army Group North, Center, and South but I have not seen any dates for that. To be honest I couldn't fit the entire series in my game room now anyway, but I doubt that will stop me if the older titles are re-released.

RATING: 5
I have more game time to get in before I decided whether to change this "meh" rating to something higher or lower.  Since I have begun to read books on KPW, the designer's choices have become clearer.  

The game is highly playable, but is it replayable?  And MMP's cheap components--even the dice are bad--do not help.  The map is good, but I am getting a bit tired of Mark's  point-to-point designs, as they are beginning to take on a cookie-cutter feel, something I never thought I would hear myself say about his work.  The counters look retro Avalon Hill from the 1960's, not a good thing.

See my review, if you are interested.

RATING: 8
Good game on a rare topic.  Generally not a fan of point to point, but this one is fun.  Love the randomness and chaos of combat.  The only real nevative is the graphic treatment--guess I really  don't care for Eskubi's counter design, hard to read and lacking basic information.  The map is okay (period treatment would have been far better) but the choice of stripes and colors doesn't work well and isn't well coordinated between counters and map.  Last thing:  I'm a solitaire gamer and it works well.

RATING: 5.7
Note to self: Colonists need to attack warriors (not villages except to gain pathways) because they regenerate (not the Indians). Much of the game is trapping and channeling each other. Indians can EVADE and usually take an early lead. Play Church arrives turn 3 AND Colonists can cross borders.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Light wargame that is worthy of being "beer and pretzels" by my definition (relatively brief, less time looking up rules and more time playing, "get on with it" mechanics,  etc.). 

More experience required, but I believe there is ample opportunity for both sides to attack/defend, which is good. Varying effects from combat make for somewhat unpredictable results, throwing a bit more chaos into the situation than some folks will like and other will not. Reminds me a bit of the dynamic puzzle feeling that I get from some simpler Columbia Games games. This is not a block game though. Although I played PBEM, I suspect it would only take about two hours FtF due to limited movement/combat potential each turn.

PROS: Light. Relatively quick playing. Simple rules, but with enough decision points to interest many gamers. Not a bad little game. Unique in many ways (beyond its subject matter). Fun.

CONS: Combat events rolls can drastically affect combat. Not an issue in itself, but considering the small number of combats and limited, point to point map (impacting maneuverability) I think a few bad rolls in critical battles can greatly impact a session. This is just a theory at this time. Flexibility may be somewhat limited also (another theory...I am full of them).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
After a second play, I'm a little more lukewarm. The second time actually played better - more maneuver, more raiding, more interesting stuff. But at the end of the day I think this is a lot of smoke but not much fire. Battles are almost always indecisive, so it's all about raiding and burning, which is really just a crap shoot. Unfortunately there isn't much upside to either player seeking battle - since raiding generates points so much more quickly, trying to block raids by facing off against the armies quickly leaves you too far behind on the points track. Also, the reinforcement schedule seems wacky - the game rapidly leaves you with more troops than you can possibly use, and the tradeoffs between keeping reduced-strength units alive and giving up the VP to lose them but get them back as replacements is odd.

All in all, this game did not feel fully baked as a game, and didn't do a great job at conveying the history of the war either. 
---
Played once, a classic bubble game. There is good stuff and stuff I'm not enamored of. I like the story arc and flavor of the game: it starts out as a small back-and-forth with a few units in Rhode Island, and nicely escalates into a board-spanning slug-fest with tribes entering and leaving the game in a scripted, but still quite interesting manner. The movement system is clever and I always like games where battles are means to an end rather than an end in and of themselves - this is another game that's really about political control, i.e. burning down villages, rather than about defeating armies.

On the other hand, there wasn't nearly as much maneuver as I expected. In some ways it parts of it resembled WWI as stacks sat next to each other and slugged it out for turns on end as the Colonials tried to leverage their numerical superiority. The Indians really need to burn two villages in two turns or their schedule gets derailed, and with the wildly variable combat system, they can get randomly hosed early. The random arrival of Church is a little crazy, and I recommend the "arrive on turn 3" rule. And there are some odd trade-offs; I think the Colonials need to take some VP hits early on lost units so they can keep "kill stacks" at high strength and hammer the Indians, instead of avoiding VP losses but getting their army clogged up with weak units. Fine, but this is unintuitive and not great. Also, there is a touch of chromy complexity which is also not great in a fast-playing, pretty chaotic game.

Not sure of the bottom line. It plays pretty quickly - we aren't fast players and we got done in 2.5 hours with rules, so that's great and probably earns the game another play to see if the interesting stuff is strong enough to make the game. But it's in a tough space, and it didn't grab me the way the designer's Hearts & Minds did.

RATING: 6
The basic combat system seemed to take too much time for something that was to be repeated so much. It was certainly ingenious but paled after a while. The topic (which is essentially cleansing of areas of the opposition) suffers from being attritional and slow. I would recommend it for those who enjoy lots of combat (it reminded me of an East Front game with lots of factors and a wide set of CRT results) for whom a 7.5 rating would be applicable.

Not a fan of this game. Played once as Native Americans. I rolled doubles 1 out of 3 rolls meaning that I got no reinforcements until turn 4. Church came out in turn 3. My tribes were surrendering before I could even do anything in the game. I would hope that not all games are so miserable given the die rolls. But because the game play is completely driven off random rolls and events, there is hardly much strategy to go on. The concept was good, pieces were great, rules well written, but the game was not for me.

Nice game and very good game design particularly for such a difficult war to simulate.
If you just place counters and rolls dice you might blame the game to be too random but you could tell that of any game. The game has some strategic challenges and the random part is totally manageable by assigning proper amount of troops to your objectives and planning.
Superior to Wilderness War in playability, historicity and strategic gameplay. It also plays faster.

Best played with all the options (in section 18) and and with historical scenario ( fixed arrival tine for Church) .

This one, based on skirmishes and massacres between colonials and the autochthonous Americans, is a unique challenge. The special dice ensure a certain level of chaos/uncertainty, but the mechanics are such as to create the necessity of a variety of actions across the colonial territories. Except for one of my learning games at a WBC, every game I've played has been close--and that's as it should be.

The map is good, the subject is fascinating, and the rules are accessible. However, it is simply decided by a few die rolls. If the Indians fail a few early rolls then you might as well start all over again. Basically, he who rolls better raids better, and that really is not much fun. It does not help that the units look ugly. Poniske's Hearts and Minds is a much better game, and I expect his take on the Civil War to be a winner. Unfortunately King Philip's War must be considered a disappointment.

RATING: N/A
Seems less fun as released than the version I playtested at Winter Offensive.  Part of this is due to the toned down Massacre & Panic results (which used to lead to a lot more carnage) and some of it is other tweaks which downplay the amount of maneuver.  This resulted in me trading the game off...

As usual, since I was a playtester, no rating for the game.

RATING: 8
Very good light wargame. We had it playing quickly out of the box. Having seen the play-test copy, I prefer how the roads used to be - they were easier to see. (personally I would prefer different colors for the roads - to make it easier to see where the road networks go).

The Diplomacy allows the game to flow in different directions each time.

The battle event die allows for a quick, effective random element to be added to the game.

Highly recommend - especially if you like lighter, very easy to solitaire wargames.

Picked this up on sale... interesting bit of history that I was not really aware of even though I lived off of the Wampanoag trail for years. A bloody, brutal and sad history that the game captures through town burnings and attrition. Low counter count and straight forward rules make this a candidate for introductory wargamers.

Interesting game on a conflict that I had never heard about before learning of the controversy surrounding the publication of this game.

A relatively light game about a topic I'd know little about until I played. 

I liked a lot of the ideas in the game, such as the Indian surrender based on colonial VP and the lack of inherent supply based on the razed villages. However, the supply issue only comes up once in the winter turn.

If I had a complaint, and this is reaching, it's that the Indian counters are all the same save for the background stripe. In poor lighting conditions it would have been easy to mix some of them up.

Fast, fun game with a great period feel on a topic seldom examined by the gaming community. Plays very well solo or 2 player, with very little downtime due to the limited number of actions each player can take. The events dice and the fact that a doubles die roll cancels the battle, means that there is no such thing as a certain result in a given battle.

RATING: 7
Not so much slash and burn as huff and puff. Late-stage rejiggering of the special event effects seems to have taken the teeth out of the combat system from the version I playtested (take a look at the earlier rule sets posted here in the Files section, where you can do the comparison).

My initial impressions, based on some solo run-throughs, is that the first couple of turns will often prove decisive. If the Indian can't pull off some big raids right away it's going to be hard to compensate later on.

Still, as a two or three hour diversion, I can see the appeal. Both sides have to strike a balance between allocating assets for attack and defense. Kudos to the designer for tackling a novel topic.

Fun and a topic "ground breaking" war game.  The war game plays quick, is entertaining and is great fun.  For people who live in New England and want to understand its past, this is a ground breaker.  The combat results table is excellent as it integrates many layered results affecting both sides with just one roll of the dice.  Clever because you don't need multiple dice rolls; a real time saver.  Now if John Poniske can come out with a small scenario on the earlier Pequot War fought between 1634–1638, that would really rock.

I think it is a nice game and I had fun playing it. I think it is more of a game than a simulation. I believe it were more of a simulation it would have looked more like SPI's Fredrick the Great or more like a CDG like Wilderness War. 
Good points
It is quick, simple, & fun to play.
Solitaire friendly
It is a unique subject not covered by other games.
Nice theme, you can get into "going on the warpath" if you play the native americans.
replayable
big counters!
nice map
weaknesses
More luck based than other wargames.
On the two strenght side of the infantry counters the two figures should have been separated more to where one can see them better sort of like the allied indian counters.
The color mix up on what was on the map vs counter was confusing.
Would have been nice to see some of the important rules in bigger print. 
I don't think it is as good as John Poniske's Hearts & Minds but overall I am happy I got it. it would nice to see a mini game to go with it about the war with the Cherokees in my East Tennessee region during 1700's

Play tested at [url=www.totalcon.com]Total Confusion 2010[/url].  Played 2 short games back to back swapping sides.  Played 1 long game.  Can't wait for this to arrive.

Ok so this arrived with some tweaks to the rules.  Not all of these are good.  Still a fun game though.  I think I would prefer the play test rules for the short game over the final version.  Playing the longer version I could go either way.  I have a copy of the play test rules in my box.  I miss the names of the tribes and colonies on the counters in the production copy of the game. 

Getting used to the production rules for the long game.

RATING: 4
Cuts too many corners, and the development effort is poor. Production values are lacking also.

I actually don't mind the rather large luck element; the special die is a welcome chrome element, too. Nor do I mind the brutality of the situation portrayed; the designer handles this well in his notes.

Plays well solitaire. Interesting setup choices. But gameplay is not nearly engaging enough as both sides seemingly play by rote.

The example-of-play in the back of the rule book is disjointed, error prone, and fails to do its job.

I very much appreciate the designer tackling a difficult subject matter here, and several clever/streamlined ideas are present, but once again the developer lets us down. The enormous errata/Q&A file speaks volumes.

Overall first impression - a disappointment.

Northfield -- I may have gone to high school in you, but don't think that'll save you if you get in the way of my warbands!

In terms of gameplay, KPW is an enjoyable experience, on the quick and simple side.  Probably too much randomness with the cancelled attacks and event die to really be called a "simulation" but as a highly evocative game it works well for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The definition of mediocrity at its most mediocre.  

The game has a nice map and is fairly simple to play.  Travel by sea and by rivers adds an element of mobility that most games do not enjoy.  While neither I nor my opponent utilized this option much, it could have shaken things up a good deal.  Unfortunately, there is not much chance that I will ever play this again due to the fact that the game has flaws which prevent it from being an enjoyable gaming experience.

King Philip's War has possibly the weakest combat system that I have ever encountered.  Since everything is based on random die rolls and a handful of often non-sensical and repetitive events, there is no skill involved with combat or while fighting in congested areas such as Plymouth colony.  At the same time, the low stacking limits and intrinsic defensive values of villages and settlements makes a pitched battle at any one of those sites impossible to win for the attacker, barring spectacular luck.  Thus there is no reason why an intelligent colonial player should ever completely lose an entire colony, unless their die rolls are bad.

The idea that colonies and tribes should produce a set number of units per turn regardless of how many villages remain to them is a sign that the designer(s) gave no thought to the logistics of war.  A close game does not seem very likely.  Either Church will be late in coming and the raid rolls for Philip will get lucky and the Indians will rack up a huge lead that the colonial player cannot catch or Church will come early and King Philip's rebellion will be quashed in a slow, boring, and predictable game of attacking undefended villages/settlements.

These flaws would be acceptable if the game were fun or in some way made the player care about the game.  However, after four turns of "action", neither the two people playing nor the moderator cared to experience more of the game.  As I said at the outset, this is not a terrible game, it is just not good.  The hype here was undeserved and King Philip's War will be to the small community of war board gamers what the Star Wars prequel trilogy was to millions of movie-goers, a festering disappointment with no lifeforce and an example of a squandered opportunity.

RATING: 6
Little strategy other than attacking villages/settlements over and over again with 2-3 units.  Little need for attacking enemy units.  Game is ruled by the dice since there does not seem to be much strategy.  The "attack canceled when roll doubles" gets really annoying the 3rd time a large army cannot attack an undefended village.  Combat and events are totally dependent on luck and there's not much you can do to counteract a streak of bad luck.

Quick to play, easy to learn rules, a really cool variable die (as in dice, not death) mechanic, and lots of strategy. If you are looking for a good strategic game to play in about 2-3 hours, look no further.  (side note: I'm a playtester for this game)

Also, John is a wonderful designer and has been very responsive throughout the playtest process. A real pleasure to work with. Congrats on a beautiful and fun game John!

The theme and game don't work at all together; aka it's totally pasted on. I think there's limited replay value and they could have done A LOT better in a lot of regards but... it's fun for now. Will probably sell after newness wears off unless expansions come out.

RATING: 7.8
Nice game, semi-cooperative with potential to be great with the right group (or at the right moment). It promotes player interaction with a bit of take completely in tune with the theme, speaking of which, it is a given with teens. My two kids (boys,14 and 16)enjoyed a lot, unquestonably due to the strong felling towards the original videogame IP. I do recommend, but never as the "main course" of the night, good to open/end game night. Great quality in the components, CMON after all.

RATING: 8
Great combo of Co-op and competitive play. Co-operation is strongly encouraged to prevent monsters from running away, but it is also in your best interest to betray your opponents. Some of the upgrade cards are way more useful than others, but even the ones that I normally perceive as low-tier have been used by others to great success.

This is a great cut throat card game of pretending to cooperate only to back out and let your friend die. Or maybe youre the one who stays in and you best the enemy all by yourself and score all the points. I wish it played at 2 players since I think I'd get it to table more. I also cant wait for the expansion since I think its big weakness is lack of variety on weapons, enemies and bosses.

RATING: 8
A great, albeit very simplified, dungeon crawler. The only major flaws that I found were a severe lack of content and thus variety--before I had even played the game five times, I had already seen all of the cards in the game multiple times! Still, the game is very mechanically sound and a blast to play with four other people.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
If you've ever played Cutthroat Caverns, this is essentially a streamlined reskin of that game.

This game is incredibly fast and very light weight, but every turn is an interesting push-your-luck decision as you decide if you can get just one more hit off or if the next creature will be your end. There can be a snowballing problem of the player in last place just being dragged behind the whole game, but it's so fast that most people don't notice. I love this game. I wish I could get a more compact version of it because then I'd pack it as a lightweight, portable, filler game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.9
It's interesting, because on the surface it's a very simplistic semi-cooperative card game where you're just taking out a string of monsters one by one, but it's in the details of how you have to plan out which actions to spend and when to escape into the Hunter's Dream that it becomes tenser, tight and interesting decision-wise. The art and dark tone is straight from the game, and a few mechanics like the blood echoes do reflect it well enough, but just don't dive into this expecting the adventurous feel of the video game (which is great, by the way).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A brilliant design that keeps all the parts of the videogame that would work in a card game, and ditches the rest. -1 Point for having two Final Bosses (Rom and Micolash) that make the game worse if used. 

Also has one of the best inserts in the biz!

Fun game! Teaming up to beat up big bads, but it will be advantageous at some point to "encourage" your fellow fighters to leave the battle so you get more points. Fun to stab your friends in the back and see how long you can last in battle. Perfectly long for a simpler, take that push-your-luck game.

This game is a pretty quick study in trying to get in on the kill, and sit out when you need to. Hedge out other people for that kill shot and build your hand of weapons wisely to deal with the enemies and hurt your fellow hunters along the way.

While the box says 3-5, 5 is the best 4 is still very fun, and 3 should be avoided, as it takes a lot of the intensity out.

RATING: 7
One of the few semi-coop games that seems to work.  This is a more stream lined tale on something like "Cutthroat Caverns"... and it works really well.  There is take that, but its about picking the right moment rather than constantly happening.  I have not played the video game, so don't know much about the theme, but as just a game, the game is good, so I imagine if you like the theme, this is probably a no brainer to pick up.  Game has a ton of replayability too since you really don't use many of the cards in each game... Making the variety on the dungeon huge.

Don't know if this really captures the Bloodborne feel, but it was a fun card game. Definitely would want to play with 4+ players. Interesting 'press your luck' mechanic which I don't normally like, that is implemented well here and this is the piece of the game that definitely captures the Bloodborne feel the best. 

15 minutes in I thought the game was going to be a 5/10, but it definitely got better. Need a few more plays to land on a definitive rating, but a 7 is around the mark for now.

Bloodborne the video game is amazing. This card game does a great job of replicating the experience as closely as possible. My only complaints are that it doesn't play particularly well at 2-players (I don't even know if it is designed to play at 2-players, but I've seen conflicting product information that it can be) and the Hunter standee is just a cardboard chit. It would have been nice, particularly from a CMON game to have a nicer Hunter component. That being said, it's a solid game. I just haven't played it enough or with the right group to this point.

I picked this up at Gencon and it's fantastic. I went in to this with bias because of my love for this and other 'Souls' video games. After a few plays, it definitely feels like Cutthroat Caverns. I do like this more as it is less "mathy" and plays much faster. I've only tried this with a few of the easier Final Bosses, but I look forward to trying the tougher ones.

It's only not an 8 cuz I wouldn't necessarily suggest it given access to so many great games that suit my taste more (heavier ones, for example). But Bloodborne is solid and has a high intersection level, AND there isn't a ton a of tiny font reading to do the whole time like in lots of games. Artwork is cool, although I've never played the videogame. 

The whole thing reminds me just a little of Shadow Hunters and Citadels. But not in any concrete way.

I have to begin by stating that Bloodborne is my favorite video game, so that may bias my opinion a bit.  Now, this game doesn't really capture the feeling of the video game, but I wasn't disappointed by that as I didn't expect it to.  The gameplay itself is rather interesting.  Every turn, all players pick one card from their hand and play it face down, revealing it when all players have picked their cards.  The cards played will mostly be weapon cards that do damage to the monster, with a few very important exceptions - a transform card, which allows you to see all other played cards before you choose your card, and a "Hunters Dream" card, that removes you from attacking (but not being attacked), and sends you back to the hunters dream to "reset" your stats, bank blood echoes, and choose an upgrade.  Each player takes a turn as the "starting player" and that drives the decisions you make as far as which card you want to play. Only hunters that deal damage to the monster in the round it is killed will receive a trophy (3 trophy types, each worth points at game end).  I really liked the mind games you could play, and for being such a simple game (really is easy to teach IMO), it is a bit deeper than I initially thought.  In the end, I've decided that I do like this game quite a bit, and the others I played with (who do not like the video game) actually enjoyed it more than they thought they would.  Which I think was a good sign.

RATING: 7
I like the aesthetics of this one however the game is rather too light. Fighting with monsters is not very engaging, you can't feel any real threat or danger. It basically breaks down to choosing whether to fight a monster (and choosing right card for it) or retire to Hunter's Dream.

Enjoyed this, it's light and slightly random affair with nice components (though it was very hard to punch the tokens without ripping them) and a very good insert. I think repeat plays will benefit from knowing the weapons in greater detail. Though the overall look is fine, I think the clarity of the cards isn't excellent due to dark and sombre mien, which is in fitting with the IP, which is a bit slapped on. In fact very slapped on. In fact, though I like the theme, I feel Mr Lang had this design and that CMON were testing the waters for acquiring this IP for a miniatures game (which may appear in the future) and that this IP was appropriated for the already existant design, perhaps to see how popular the IP is amongst boardgamers, who knows.

Played twice. Good, but you have to like cutthroat play. Seems similar to Cutthroat Caverns. Fans of the video game will like it, but there's going to be a large population of gamers frustrated by the possibility of dying instantly on a round, no matter how much health you have going into it. The hand-building and timing of card play is an interesting puzzle.

RATING: 8.5
I love the player interaction in this game, as well as the push your luck element.  The end game scoring has also been very close in every game.  There have been times where on the final turn, the player who is currently in last place looks around and figures out there is only 1 possible outcome where he can win (if he plays this specific card, if certain players play specific cards, and the boss deals exactly 4 damage) and then those specific things happen which results in that player winning.

Nice game, but the "setting" doesn't match at all with the gameplay (the videogame is skill based, the board game is luck based, or "push your luck").

Considering that I'm a huge fan of Eric Lang's work (eg. Blood Rage) I was kind of let down with one. The game seems a little bit underwhelming, and feels like an average card game. Choose a card, flip, enemy attacks, you attack, rinse and repeat until the game is over. I had really high hopes for this one, but my friends and I just really couldn't get into it. Ok if you're a die-hard fan of the game, but don't be expecting a whole lot otherwise.

Eric Lang's games are solid gold for me at this point. I don't know anything about the theme as I've never played demon souls/dark souls/bloodborne. It is dark and gritty and I can appreciate that. The game is super easy to learn and teach, and its relatively quick to play. 40-45 minutes is about the average. There is one boss in the game I'm not a huge fan of mechanically, so we usually take him out of the rotation.

The game has the right amount of player interaction for the type of game it is. I'm not sure if my rating will change, or if game play will get old and tired for me as I don't see this game getting any expansions, but as of right now it's one of my favorite new games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
So Bloodborne, I am going to admit right now before dwelling deep into the game, that I DO NOT like this game.
I tried liking it, I wanted to badly, how could I not? It's one of my favourite video games and I wanted to love the card game version of the dark Gothic, plague ridden, monster slaying, brutal and punishing world set in Yharnam.

[b]Reasons I own it:[/b]

[url=https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/bloodborne-ps4/][size=10][b]BLOODBORNE, the PS4 game[/b][/size][/url]
That's it, I got it without checking the gameplay and decided to get it just out of my love & craze I have for the video game.

[b]Components and presentation[/b]

It's a CoolMiniorNot game, so the components are really good, the box also comes with a neat insert that fits everything well. Component wise, it's worth every penny. 
The cards are thick, the health dial is really good, the blood-echo tokens feel nice to hold, the player board is a sturdy cardboard.

I do have a minor quibble with the art, they have taken the artwork from the game and it really didn't suit well with the dark colour scheme, there is a difference when you see that art on monitor as opposed to a print and they should have done something else. I understand they might have had licensing limits or other issues, but I wish the card game had it's own artwork.

The second component that I disliked was the dice, now it could have been the expense in production that they chose to go with a simple dice. But for a game like Bloodborne, to go with the theme, a custom dice would have been brilliant as oppose to this red, yellow and green dice that stands out like an ugly pimple.

[b]Reasons I don't like playing it:[/b]

Bloodborne the card game takes place or tries to emulate [url=http://bloodborne.wiki.fextralife.com/Chalice+Dungeon]The Chalice Dungeon[/url] from the actual video game, but not quite; As a HUGE Bloodborne fan it's no way close to a Chalice Dungeon experience. Again, I am not one of those who bicker about a TV series or movie matching my favourite book when the medium is translated over to a different medium, but drawing random monster after monster until you reach a boss isn't Chalice Dungeon. The enjoyment of Chalice Dungeon in Bloodborne, the video game has so much to do with the exploration and discovering new places. They could have just called it an arena or something.

So you keep drawing one card after another until you meet the Boss of the level. And on your journey, if you are lucky you might find some good weapon to help you in your battle.
You then add up your collection of blood echo and trophies earned for score. That's it. Rinse and Repeat with different monsters.

It's mean and its cut-throat and you can mess around with your opponents if you really want to.
A quote from the rulebook which says you can negotiate but then lie if you want too.

[q]Players are free to discuss which card they intend to play and negotiate with the other Hunters to try to defeat the creatures in the dungeon. But all cards must be selected and played secretly and simultaneously! You are never required to play a particular card, even if you said you would![/q] And I do not enjoy mean games and when I am playing I am not looking for methods to kick my opponent in the face and laugh about how they didn't see it coming.


[b]Favourite gameplay mechanisms[/b]

Why would I have a favourite gameplay mechanism if I don't like the game? Well, I do have a few. I never once said that [u]Bloodborne is bad game[/u], it's just not my cup of tea and it turned out to be something else from what I was expecting.

- It's quite easy to teach, not really a gameplay mechanism but I'd rather put it here.
- The misleading feeling of "semi co-op" where the game itself is a cut-throat competitive game. However, the feel of semi-cop is one aspect they nailed from Chalice Dungeon. You do feel the co-op journey in Bloodborne's Chalice Dungeon, where you explore with a buddy, minus the explore part.
- The losing of Blood Echoes. This is probably the laziest choice for a favourite mechanic but I really like the fact that there is that risk and push your luck element involved just like the video game.
- Everyone gets rewarded, now this again isn't a gameplay mechanism but something I liked in the game.


Bloodborne unlike Zombicide Black Plague wasn't an impulsive buy, I did not do my research before buying the game and that probably is one of the mistake I made. However, like Zombicide I am not planning to trade Bloodborne, and the reason is simply my love for the video game. It's going to be on my shelf as some kind souvenir or collectible item of a a beloved game from another realm.
I don't see it getting played at all, one big reason being Renu will not enjoy the game for sure as 80% game revolves around die rolls with very less option to mitigate it or rather no way to mitigate it (yeah theme, whatever!! War of Ring drips theme and its dice based game I really like with plenty of mitigation options).

With all the respect to Mr. Lang that he deserves, I really don't enjoy any of his games that I have played so far and Bloodborne is no exception (not sure what future holds, may be I will change my mind).
I find Bloodborne a drag and a boring 60-90 minutes of rolling dice trying to kill monster with a okay deck-building element to it.

Love the video game to death, really cannot enjoy the card game.

RATING: 7
This is a light game of push-your-luck and kill stealing. While some have compared it to Cutthroat Caverns, it's a significantly shorter and lighter affair. So strong is the push-your-luck element here that it's probably more in the Diamant family than the Cutthroat Caverns family. While enjoyable and easy-to-learn, it is likely to appeal much more to the people who have played the video game itself. Some people I played with who were familiar with the source material seemed a lot more excited as the various weapons became available, whereas I pretty much only looked at the mechanical bonuses offered by each one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
Probably the worst game I've played since the Archer fiasco a few years back. The mechanics in this game are poorly thought out. For example, the only difference between a ranged weapon and a melee weapon is just that. There may be a card that references whether you used one or the other, but ranged and melee have no real differences in use. You also spend every other or every third turn "sleeping" so you don't die. The trophies are also meaningless, so why have three different types?

Played at GenCon 2016. Play as a demon hunter with the semicooperative twist of wanting to kill the monsters with your group, yet wanting the most prestige for doing so.

Push your luck/take that game set in the Bloodborne universe. You fight your way through the rabble of Yarnham and the bosses of the series in an effort to bank the most blood.

There are items your opponents can use to swap up the order in which you fight or even take you out of the fight before you're able to do anything and cause you to lose your souls. Will you stay and fight and risk the blood you have or take the safer route and head back to the hunters dream to bank your precious blood.

Initial Rating: 4.5 (December 2016)

As is usual from me, I bought Bloodborne: The Card Game without knowing anything at all about the game. I don’t know the source material and this is the first time I heard about Bloodborne. When the game arrived I realized it was from Cool Mini or Not, a company that has 100% failure rate with me, so my desire to play the game plunged, but many friends did play the video game and they wanted to play it so we played it.

The rules are easy to teach, you can do it under 10 minutes. Playtime is more than 1 hour which is way too long for such a simple game. As is usual from CMON, the art is amazing and the game´s components are good, but the gameplay is very boring and obvious.

The theme is very cool and I think players who also played the video game will enjoy the game more.

Bloodborne: The Card Game is a game in the same vein than Cutthroat Caverns. As a team you are trying to defeat monsters, but you are also trying to win alone, thus, you need to betray at some point and you also need some luck to win. I generally dislike betrayal games, and this one is not the exception. The gameplay is painfully obvious, you always know the better card to play. There is a lot of luck with the monsters , the equipment and the die. A player who can buy a good equipment can win easily, a player who is near death but risk the fight with the monster can win easy enough if luck goes his way and he doesn’t die, to summarize, the game has lots of uncontrollable luck and obvious decisions, a huge minus for me.

The gameplay is very repetitive and boring.

I like Bloodborne: The Card Game a bit more than Cutthroat Caverns because here you win some blood if you helped to defeat the monster, not only when you kill it, so it is much more fair! Besides, the trophies gave the game another thing to consider.

Bottom line, Bloodborne: The Card Game can be a good casual game to introduce to new players, but it is way too light and boring for me. It has lots of uncontrollable luck, its length is way too much for such a simple game, it offers obvious decisions. It is a bit better than Cutthroat Caverns, but that’s not saying much. The art of the game is amazing! I´m selling my copy of the game ASAP.

So much whining in the comments on this one! Bloodborne is easy to learn and fun to play… provided that your group likes semi co-op games, bluffing, and knowing when to strategically stay in or out of a fight. If you don't like this type of play in your group, then Bloodborne is not for you. But if it's not to your taste, it doesn't mean it's a flawed or bad game!

We pull out Bloodborne when we want a fast-paced, exciting game that we can burn through in 30-45 mins. The game is much more fun when everyone has the same level of experience with the game, because knowing which weapons/items to have in your hand at any point in the game is critical. In other words, the noob(s) at your table are going to get crushed for sure until they catch on.

The trick to winning this game is knowing how to influence the combat system so that you can be the hero who banks the most blood, or be one of the heroes who is 'in on the kill' to earn a trophy. There's an art to timing all of this, and it has to do with turn order and management of damage inflicted on the monsters and bosses.

Also, savvy players will be quick to memorize the weapons and items that are most powerful and versatile. There's a long-game strategy to be played here, where staying out of a battle with a Hunter's Dream may cost you a few blood echoes or even a trophy, but allow you to have first pick of that Beast Claw or Molotov Cocktail, which will come in handy in the next fights.

This is a great game that requires a little bit of a chess mind with some luck. Sequencing and timing is key. The dice don't overly influence outcomes or determine the winner. If anything, the player order and mad dash for weapons during Hunter's Dream have the greatest impact on outcomes.

On the cons side, with experienced players, we find that the first few monsters in the deck end up escaping because everyone just plays Hunter's Dream in the opening rounds to snag better weapons from the visible upgrades. To counteract this, we've tried house rules where upgrade cards remain face down throughout the game. Makes for a real nail biter because playing Hunter's Dream suddenly becomes a gamble… You never know what you're going to get, and your opponents don't know what's in your hand. Surprises galore!

Bloodborne is loads of fun for us. The look of the game is dark and gritty and the blood echo tokens look really cool on the table. Looking forward to the expansion, Hunter's Nightmare, due out March 30!

RATING: 4
A "co-op" experience that probably depends on how your group approaches take-that mechanics. We tried to avoid anything that hurt other players in our play through, but then the ending felt a little awkward as one person was deemed the "winner" of fighting a bunch of monsters together. Probably just not for us, but not a bad game if you like that type of gameplay.

The most complicated game of rock-paper-scissors, but not against your friends! This is an arena-type competition to gain the most points at the end!

In general, Bloodborne is a game about risk management with a bit of group think, inventory management/upgrades, and tactical play. You start with a hand of basic weapons, which you get to upgrade to improve your fighting combos and capabilities.

Each turn, one monster chosen at random attacks players, who fight back as a team, with everyone playing a card from their hand simultaneously to attempt to kill the monster. Players collect blood from the monster, assuming it dies, based on how much damage they dealt. Monsters can fight back with exploding dice that can potentially deal infinite damage.

Ein Aktion-Selektion Spiel, bei dem man aus seiner Kartenhand eine Karte aussucht, und gleichzeitig mit den anderen Spielern aufdeckt.
Ziel ist es einen gemeinsamen Gegner in der Mitte zu bezwingen, der allerdings auch zurückhaut. Wer hilft diesen Gegner zu töten, erhält Trophäen und Blutpunkte, wer sich lieber schützt erhält dies nicht, darf sich aber vollständig heilen und eine Karte aus der Auslage in seine Kartenhand nehmen, sowie alle ausgespielten Karten zurück auf die Hand nehmen. Punkte gibt es für gesammeltes Blut und Trophäen am Ende des Spiels.
Ich hatte in jeder Runde das Gefühl zur falschen Zeit Startspieler zu sein, nämlich jedes mal dann wenn ein Monster neu auftaucht. Denn ich mache zwar Schaden, aber helfe nicht es zu töten und erhalte somit in der Runde keine Trophäe. In der darauffolgenden Runde ist das Monster schon sehr geschwächt (ob ich nun geholfen habe oder meine zwei Kompanen es runtergedroschen haben ist egal), dass sobald ich als letzter Spieler draufhauen möchte kein Schaden mehr zu machen ist, ich somit nicht am tot beteiligt war und somit keine Blutpunkte und auch keine Tropäe erhielt, was ein verlorener Zug bedeutet. Das ist mir in 4-5 Runden so passiert und ich hatte keine Ahnung was ich dagegen tun sollte. Ein Spieler hatte eine super Waffe, mit der er jede Runde angreifen konnte und danach sogar alles wieder auf die Hand nehmen durfte und natürlich auch vollständig heilen und sich eine Karte aus dem Pool nehmen. Vorraussetzung war nur, dass er nicht das meisste Blut hatte.
Das einzige was ich immer erhielt waren die Trostbluttropfen, die der Spieler erhält, der in dem Moment am schlechtesten dasteht.
Hat schon Spaß gemacht, aber hat sich nicht ganz fair angefühlt. In einer vierer Runde passiert das dann aber nicht schätze ich.

I had come in knowing this was a fairly light and chaotic game, and thought I woulf still like it in a Colt Express sort of way, for the traits already listed + plan your action and watch everyone else screw it up. Also the risk reward of when to play hunter's dream seemed cool. However I was left fairly disappointed. In Colt Express, the movement literally adds another dimension to the variability of what your action will do, and also adds some fun hijinks where you try to shoot someone and then they jump out of the way, forcing you to shoot someone else. Here, the variability were from the different cards, but while taking you down different avenues eventually all the effects felt like effects I'd seen many times before. Also the set collection on the scoring tracks felt really tacked on. I did in fact like the risk reward of when to use hunter's dream however.

Gioco di carte competitivo/collaborativo.
Vengono rivelati, uno alla volta, una serie di mostri minori con delle reward ed abilità personali. Tutti i giocatori scelgono una delle carte della loro mano con la quale possono scegliere se ferire il mostro o rigenerarsi.
In base al danno inflitto al mostro si prendono dei punti, che vanno poi messi al sicuro giocando l'apposita carta, pena il perderli tutti in caso di morte del personaggio.
I giocatori che uccidono il mostro prendono punti aggiuntivi.
Non mancano carte per rubare punti o fare del male agli altri giocatori.
Rigiocabilità elevata, ci sono alcune carte che sono a mio avviso troppo potenti ed in mano a giocatori più esperti possono renderli inarrestabili.
Molto adatto ai neofiti

Interesting "hand building" (like deck building, but you draw your entire deck) game. Initially feels like a co-op game, but is actually competitive. Like Secrets and Dolores (two other games Lang designed) a core mechanic is compromising with other players, but being able to bluff about the compromise and screw them over.

Presentation-wise, I have a few minor issues: for a game by "Cool Mini or Not" I expected a cool mini rather than a cardboard standee for the current player marker. Also, the victory point trackers are cardboard chits that cover up the number on the tracker; rings or transparent discs would work better. And finally, the image on the back of the monster cards looks like an item, and the image on the back of the item cards looks like a monster.

After all of the negative reviews I saw on BGG I was pleasantly surprised when Bloodborne was one of my favorite games from the con.  As previously stated it has a Cuttthroat Caverns-esque feel.  There is some very light deck building from the upgrades and the game moves at a very brisk pace.  As a fan of the PS4 game I was very pleased.

While I don't think this really fits the theme of the single player Bloodborne video game, I do think that this is a great push your luck game. The art is gruesome and looks great, but I think that's actually to the detriment of the game. If this game got a reskin with different art It'd be a staple game for sure. It's a lot of fun, and has the same issues of every exploding dice game, but only having one die of each color makes you kinda scratch your head.

I like the game enough but the theme feels weird, and the components look nice, but really you should have a few more of each die.

Sold this game to a friend, who is a huge fan of the video game, as it wasn't getting enough play.

RATING: 7
Good: 
Plays quickly. 

Art matches the video game/theme. 

I enjoy the concept of a competitive co-op that takes place in the Bloodborne universe.

Bad: 
There aren't enough ways to mitigate luck making the game feel extremely untactical and swingy. So there are many rounds where you simply will not be able to strike the creature, avoid a strike, or get crit to death. 

The game doesn't make it feel like you are actually battling fierce creatures. You toss a card down, drain some blood, and if you don't kill it the creature runs away. I was expecting more attack, dodge, and take-that play. 

The deck limit is pretty restricting, so no one really feels unique even when they have a bunch of unique cards in their deck. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Feels similar to a game like Cutthroat Cavers or Munchkin in that it's a competitive "screw over the other players" game with the trappings of a co-op game. But what sets Bloodborne apart from those two games is that Bloodborne feels much less openly malicious. Harming other players often feels much more incidental. 

Instead of singling out an individual player and targeting him or her with a malicious effect, you instead target the entire group (often including yourself). So players who may take competitive games a bit personally or get angry when other players harm them (I have two such players in my usual board game group) may find Bloodborne a much more tolerable experience because they are less likely to feel like they are picked on.

More people the better. The semi-cooperative nature of the game feels right on theme with the dark Bloodborne universe (having completed the PS4 title), especially as any foe could wipe out every player in one turn (though highly unlikely with basic mobs). The only issue seems to be the game becomes a little unbalanced once a few very powerful item cards get draw with other players struggling to keep up in the late game. Otherwise great components and well designed stat cards.

RATING: 8
Overview: 
A fun deck-building, push-your-luck, combat game where you play a hunter trapped in a dungeon attempting to be get the most souls! 3-5 players required. For those who have played the video-game, the board game mimics the chalice dungeons rather than the main story.

Art? 
Its nice. Nothing spectacular, but its fun to see monsters from the video game show-up on cards, even if their game effects do not quite line up with the video game monsters.

Quality? 
Good quality cards and tokens. There is some manual assembly of spinners, but nothing major. Admittedly, my box did come with one useless spinner because the two connection pieces were both "female." They may have just been a fluke though.

Gameplay? 
It is honestly a ton of fun. As a team, the players encounter monsters in the dungeon one at a time. You must work together to beat the monster, but only players standing when the monster is defeated reap the rewards. 

Each turn, each player plays a card face-down - trying to time when it is best to hit the monster and stay in the fight, and when it is best to run back to the Hunter's Dream and bank the souls you've collected. If you stay in the fight and die, you loose all of your souls (and often miss out on actually reaping the rewards of defeat). 
Damage is based on dice rolls and can be quite volatile, so the game has a fair amount of risk involved, but the rewards are often worth it. 

Players start with a basic deck of cards and build their decks with more items by selecting them from cards randomly drawn and replenished from a set deck. There is a fair amount of variety, and the items you choose dictate how you will manage your playing.

One down-side is that the game needs 3 players. I really wish there was a two-player variant.

Theme? 
The theme is well executed. You quickly get the feeling that you are a party of adventurers that must watch each other carefully as you take down gruesome monsters. Other players are more of a challenge than the monsters, but that's only because they can abandon you to be slaughtered by said monsters, setting you back. More than a few laughs ensued when I played!

One thing worth noting is that the experience does not match the video game experience. The monsters do not feel as intimidating as other players, and atmosphere ends up being lighter than the in-game atmosphere. It works really well as a board game experience, but some video-game fans may be disappointed.

Replayability? 
You can definitely play the game multiple times, varying up the monsters and bosses in the dungeon's deck. The cards from which you build your deck do not change much, so that is perhaps one weakness. The risk and reward element, realized in rolling dice for the monster's damage will likely create a fair amount of variety though.

Summary:
Fun game! One of the few competitive games I have played that does not leave anyone with hard feelings. It does not have much of a Dark Souls/Bloodborne video-game feeling, but it gets players interacting in a unique way - you manage your own risk, trying to guess what others will do, without much backstabbing. You get to push your luck against other players instead of just against a preset chance mechanic, and that really creates a fun, interactive experience!

Totally disconnected enemy powers - enemy mobs, with some weird Boss design. No real sense of danger, just... risk management. Really? Very limited and repetitive content - after some plays, it's more of the same. [b]Really?![/b]

Are you a Bloodborne fan? Avoid it.

Are you interested in a semi-coop/crazy romp? Pick Cutthroat Caverns, Castaways, Dead of Winter or even Cosmic Encounter instead.

You couldn't care less about the theme and just need a fast push your luck, exploding dice crazyness, for a light evening group play? Then go ahead, you've been warned.

Very pleased by this game. I love push-your-luck games, and this one does not disappoint. Turn order can be a big deal, and once you are familiar with the various weapons you can purchase, different strategies start to present themselves. The one major downside with this game, as others have mentioned, is that the card variety is severely lacking. The weapon deck is made up of multiples of the same weapons rather than a bunch of individual ones, which seems like a bit of a misstep, in my opinion. An expansion could easily bring this game up to a 9 with added card variety. As it is, I enjoy it a lot, even with being very unfamiliar with the video game.

UPDATE: Yeah, the replay value really hurts this one. Ended up lowering this from an 8 to a 6. After the initial play, there isn't much more to see here since the weapons and enemies are all just slight variations on each other.

Terrific semi-cooperative game based off the Gothic video game. Size and speed is the key here: compact, fleet and offers a little intellectual rigor or makes you wish for a bigger game. The central mechanic is card-selection and deck-building and unlike other card-selection games where it becomes almost impossible to intuit what cards your opponents are going to select, Bloodborne makes the deduction process easier and more thrilling. The components and artwork are great, matching the beautiful and atmospheric game itself. This is a great mid-level game that doesn't wear thin and has some great tense moments between players!

Simple (yet kinda "heavy" if you really start count everything...), fun, brutal - I really like it :)

Eric Lang is one of my favourite designers of all time and Bloodborne is my favourite PS4 exclusive game. However, the card game isn't as good as either its designer or its IP would suggest. It's an OK semi-cooperative game in the same vein as Cutthroat Caverns, but it direly needs an expansion because there just isn't enough variety to it.

Pros:
1. Interesting player interaction. Working together to kill a monster while at the some time trying to inflict as much damage as possible to another player.
2. Good cards. There are a lot of cards that can be utilized in fun ways to maximize their impact.
3. Quick and easy to teach. This game plays in 30 minutes or less.
4. The large boss cards really really really change the game how it's played. Depending on which main boss card is out, will greatly impact how you play keeping each game different and interesting.
5. Theme. This game has a lot of crossover with the video game.

Cons:
1. Rules are a touch lacking. There are a few topics that need cleaning up.
2. "Promo" cards. I got promo cards that I believe we're really just fixing a card misprint. The promos were the boss version of cards that were already in the game. 
3. The box says 2 to 5 players, the rules say 3 to 5. Listen to the rule book. This game is nearly impossible to play with 2 players.

Summary: This is overall a solid game. I think a lot of the cons are due to rushed printing to get copies to Gencon. I'm hoping that they would address these issues for when this game hit full retail. Fun light game that will cause some fun yelling at each other back and forth.

Great game!! It has a nice bluffing aspect, betrayal and backstabbing so your friend doesn't collect all that unbanked blood.  you have to plan carefully, much stratagey.  It's played at least once every sitdown.

I like the game play and how it "appears" that you're all working together, but then NOT.  However, I'm worried about the length of replay-ability.  Since it's based on a game, the odds of more bosses and weapons are slim. That said, it is a quick learn and quick for strategy. Fast paced so you're not sitting around waiting for your turn.

Eric Lang took a largely single-player game of skill and turned it into a 3-5 player semi-cooperative game with backstabbing mechanics. An absolute abomination.

This is one of my all time favorite video games, so that gives it a ratings bump from me. First impression is that it is a unique mechanic with competitive teamwork, but the lack of variety in equipment and beasts will make this game probably drop a few points after repeated plays. Artwork and production are fantastic.

A push-your luck game set in the universe of the Bloodborne video game.

I generally dislike push your luck games. But the ability to customize your playstyle and directly affect your opponents puts this a head above the pack.

A neat bluffing/push your luck card game with a dark theme that I am able to overlook because it isn't overtly represented by an overload of grotesque miniatures and artwork all over the place that you are forced to look at for the entirety of the game.

Fairly light game which feels like it has an optimal way to play.  For the most part, you try to fake folks out and do damage where you can.  That said, if folks play quickly, it can be an okay lighter/shorter game.

While honestly, this game could be anything, as the theme is a bit tacked on, it's actually a fun filler game. My friends and I were surprised by it, since video games don't usually translate well to board games. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Pros: Very good.  Really starts to shine with 4+ players.  Captures the feel of the video game without trying too hard.  Simultaneously cooperative and competitive, it creates an interesting dynamic between the players.  Simple enough mechanically that it makes teaching new players quick and easy, but just deep enough strategically to keep vets engaged for several play-throughs.

Cons: Certain weapon/action cards are a little too powerful which can create some imbalances if several of them happen to go to the same player.  Trophy victory point scaling is a bit off which can sometimes result in someone running away with the game to the point where the winner may be obvious well before the end.

Overall: Fun and well designed.  Quick-playing and competitive.  Needing to cooperate with other the other hunters while simultaneously trying to hinder them makes for some great gotcha moments and interactions between players.  Can't wait to see some expansions for this.

Even though I have never played the PS4 game, this is one of my favorite games. I bring it with me to every game night. 

It was already up there the first few times I played it, then I accidentally drew a hand of monsters that seemed to increase the difficulty of the game quite a bit. It was by far my favorite play through of it.

Fun enough press-your-luck style game, though I wish there had been more variety, both to the endgame bosses and the weapons. This is at its best when it's letting players directly hinder one another; more of that, please!

This game is proudly proclaiming war on a people who need to be brought down a peg: the colorblind. A small symbol on each enemy card dictates what color die to roll. Those symbols are all a dull shade of green, yellow, or red, with nothing else to distinguish them.

About the gameplay, there are a few rule ambiguities and I would have liked some better wording on some of the cards and in the rulebook. Other than that, this seems like a pretty fun game along the lines of Incan Gold.

After watching the Dice Tower review of this game, it seems important to manage the expectations of new players. I set this game up by explaining that it is first and foremost a push your luck game. Any enemy can kill you, so you push your luck whenever you decide to stay in a round. In the Dice Tower review, Zee seemed to not be approaching the game from that perspective so he didn't enjoy it.

Update: Still liking it. Some of the cards are better than others, so I would usually complain about balance issues, but in this game it just makes the turn order more important. If you're first in turn order and there's a good card available, you might want to "rest" (by going into the Hunter's Dream) that turn so you can grab it. 

[b]Player Count Verdict: 3-4[/b]
Gameplay-wise it works fine with five players. The only problem with five is that it can go a little too long, and it can become too hard to remember what your opponents can do (a lot of cards affect your opponents based on the type of cards they play) so it feels more chaotic.

Game is fairly entertaining. My favorite part is that it initially feels like a cooperative game until you realize you are ultimately trying to kill off your fellow players to win. The game can feel a bit repetitive at times, but playing with experienced gamers helps with this. You will just need to play to understand what I mean. I would not personally buy it, but id be happy playing it every now and then.

I enjoy these back and forth card games, like Cutthroat Caverns.  The theme of this one was kind of overly dark, I know it's modeled off of the videogame, but not pleasant to look at.  The gameplay was fun enough, a big exercise in trying to guess your opponents moves with some fun gearing up and push your luck.  I enjoyed it enough, but I felt like I saw everything in that one play.

RATING: N/A
A game about risk management with a bit of group think, inventory management/upgrades, and tactical play. You start with a hand of basic weapons, which you get to upgrade to improve your fighting combos and capabilities. Players can fight as long as they want, but if they die in combat, they lose their progress.

3-5 (best 4)

Card game, hand management, drafting, press your luck

Demoed this at GenCon on Thursday night and it was amazing !  There's coop to a point to help defeat the monster before it escapes and depending on which boss card is in play that could mean different things.  For instance our first boss card stated that if a monster escapes a new one gets added to the monster deck which you have to go through before you can fight the boss..  The CMON guy running the demo said we were the worst hunters ever because we added like 10 monsters to the deck because we kept trying to screw each other over lol.  A lot of fun and we had a ton of laughs playing that game when someone would just completely screw over the group.  I some how ended up winning with 40 blood collected.  

PS: Saw Spear is AMAZING !!!!!  It does 2 damage but if before you get to attack all instant effects happen and the monster gets to attack.  Someone played a cannon that did 1 damage and then the monster did 6 so I was down to 1hp but that spear did 9 damage and I straight up murdered a mini boss.

Should ONLY be played with 4+ players. Very interesting take on the video game, which is a good thing to me since it reflects creativity but bad for fans of the original since it doesn't stay true. It also worked for me because of the small 'push-your-luck' element where you try to hold off going back into the Dream to rest. Warning: Typical Eric Lang highly broken abilities here and there, such as crazy boss abilities etc. This is NOT necessarily a bad thing, it can make for artificial epic twists that everyone will remember the session for.

Extremely bland and quite repetitive game. Basically you all play weapon cards at the same time and try to harm the bad guy: who does it better wins. There's too much chaos and luck and you really don't feel the theme at all: not a good sign for a game like this.  At least, it's not too long.
The art is gloomy but nice and refined.

RATING: N/A
Demon hunters card game based on the video game world. Dark and twisted.  Blood tokens and life wheels. Players start with identical action decks to square off against the monster deck with the overlord boss permanent effect looming for the final.  Player card play is unique with turn order and choice of expended action cards.  Risk management is central. Stay in and fight or bow out and bank the blood you scored builds each round. Monster's retaliate with dice damage. Player's will die early and often.

I really liked this one however I will say there needs to be more variations of cards. Everyone starts with the exact same hand of cards and since you are supposed to be working together/working against one another, it makes it predictable starting out. That being said there is a variety of bosses and enemies to choose from so each game is slightly different than the last.

Based on the PS4 game of the same name, this is a cooperative/competitive dungeon crawler where you need your teammates to survive, but you want to do the best. Some light "take that" stuff to your teammates, but ultimately its about trying to do the best based on hand management, light deckbuilding and mitigating turn order.

Considering the lack of information leading up to release, this ended up being a bit better than I was expecting.  It has kind of this weird dynamic to it where you need to work with other players to kill enemies, but at the same time, you want to try and set it up so only you get to collect blood echoes on the kill.  Could be rated higher if more cards were available, as it quickly gets repetitive.

2-5 players compete to defeat monsters and eventually an end boss. Using an action card selection mechanic, players can damage enemies to gain blood tokens, or return to the Hunter's Dream to save them. Death is inevitable, and unbanked blood tokens are lost.

After first game:
+ Pretty fun blind action select mechanic
-Didn't really like the Transform-card, which seem to be overpowered and making the game less of a mind game and makes some other cards pretty useless.
-Pretty hard to kill other players, monsters too weak for my taste
-First game got really long, because of stupid final boss monster ability
+Probably suprisingly fun game, if it really takes under un hour playtime

Quicker paced card game were you all fight the same threat but you're all trying to score the most points yourself. Very cut throat and fun. One flaw I've notice is that it seems a bit to easy to not die / kill other players.

RATING: 3
Here's how you play. When a turn begins, play 1 card from your hand. Then, everyone resolves their cards in a set order. Repeat this process for a while. That's the game. 

There are very few actual mechanics that enhance the thematic elements. You are able to gather blood echos when attacking enemies and store them as points if you return to the Hunter's Dream. That's basically the only thematic mechanic making it "Bloodborne" instead of "Let's Fight Monsters". 

Monsters... Honestly they are more of an annoyance that sits in the middle of the table dealing damage to everyone each round. You attack them to get blood echos but because the game is only semi cooperative, they're really just some points that deal damage. Yeah sometimes they're a threat to your points but who cares when you have three or four other players trying to kill you too. Why not make two different game modes, cooperative and competitive, instead of mashing them together until you have one big Bloodborne pile of mush?

Don't let the title fool you. Monopoly rethemed with one or two thematic elements thrown in is still Monopoly. This game isn't a half-assed retheme of an already awful game but it sure does feel like it. The artwork is all Bloodborne but the gameplay does nothing to remind the players of the awesome experience of the video game. 

My advice, return to the Hunter's Dream and avoid this sad creature for now.

PiecePack is proof that theme does matter. Plus, most of the 50 games in the book are half-baked and don't even have compelling mechanics.

Interesting idea, but I haven't seen the compelling 'killer game' that justifies owning the piecepack. Why have a set that can play 50 mediocre games when I could own one really good game that I love? I like the idea of the piecepack and I may continue to fiddle with it, but I'm not really sold yet.

[game system, 1-4p]

Maybe a game to give away.

I own The Infinite Board Game version.  The components are great, and the nice plastic pieces seem like I could take them camping and not worry about getting the outdoors on them.

I like seeing how designers take these simple components and relate them in different ways to make interesting games.  The design is really elegant.  Each suit has six ranks on six tiles, six "coins", and six faces of a die, with a pawn of each suit.

Not sure if there's any actually good games here though.  (Also, the rules in The Infinite Board game are poorly written.)

RATING: 8
A great tool for experimenting with game designs.  If you enjoy abstract games - this plus a deck of cards and ice-house pyramids grants you a cornucopia of possible options.  The standard piece-pack suits are unique and not aligned with french card suits, so that makes integration tougher - but there are piece-packs with standard card suits (although limited colors) that align.   Overall, the concept of the piece-pack is well thought out and the options are quite unlimited.  But like most game systems / tools, the overall number of great games is vastly outpaced by the number of so-so games, which in turn tends to be dwarfed by the mehs... 

Recommended as a core game for any collector or designer.

Amazing game system that is so simple, yet versatile and beautiful at the same time.  There is an incredible mixture of games available, including a number of ports of very popular European-style games. I redesigned mine to use the four elements instead of the standard suits.

A whole bunch of pieces with rules available for a whole bunch of games, I like that a lot! With around 300 solitaire games available for Piecepack, this should be a must buy for any solitaire gamer, which I am, sometimes. I have the Blue Panther set with the card suits instead of the moon, sun, etc. tiles. One negative, the nice wooden box my set came in fell apart the first time I opened it. I think the glue failed or something. Not a big deal, that's what those giant baggies are for. :)

I'm extremely disappointed by the fact that it requires at least TWO sets (and sometines more) to play most of the games designed for Piecepack.  A brilliant concept that utterly fails to deliver in practice.

Excellent as a base for game design. Some of the games available require extra components. Quality of published games varies, however there are some top-notch games in there, including many solitaires*:
Alien City (9/10)
New City (9/10)
Piecepacking Pirates* (10/10)
Cardinal's Guards* (8/10)
Galaxy Express* (8/10)

RATING: N/A
I find the concept design here amazing. James Kyle set out to make a small set of pieces, but maxing out its flexibility, and he did it! That has its drawbacks, as it can be not so easy to craft. Try to make coins from thick paper, and you'll see. The smallest mistake will betray information that should be hidden. I think maybe making it bigger (say 8x8 cm tiles), and the coins hex shaped, that could do it.

Almost all commercial versions are made from wood, which has the same problem.

Unfortunately, I glanced at the top rated (non-solo) games, and none seemed particularly interesting.

For versatility, there are few game systems that match up to the piecepack. Many games can be played with a piecepack, and the number is always growing. Of course, not all of the piecepack games are good. Some of them are quite bad. But many others are quite good, and given players, I can't imagine not wanting to play one of those good ones.

RATING: 6.5
A system I adore in theory, but in practice it occupies a slightly awkward niche for me.  

For gaming at home, naturally I have countless more appealing options available.  

And for light travel, which is what I had in mind when I bought my PP, it proves a tad too bulky.  For about the same amount of bag real estate, one could carry a well-designed chess/checkers/backgammon set, with a deck of cards tucked inside.

RATING: 7
A piecepack is to boardgames what a standard deck of cards is to cardgames.  I enjoyed playing the great variety of games online.  Unfortunately, I have yet to find that single stand-out masterpiece that makes this system more than a brilliant novelty.  Traded away.

Basically if you could make your regular playing cards square, and then threw out over half of the deck you'd have a piecepack...that being said "Alien City" by Michael Schoessow is a 10!...but you need a set of Icehouse pyramids to play...

The rating is for the LCD piecepack. 

The pieces are ok, everything is correctly cut, some variations in the colors, the dice are cute. One of the pawns has some blurred glue around. The box is transparent and has some divisions but they are too low and the pieces mix up every time. 

Conclusion: a good value for the low price.

I've played a couple of the Piecepack games now -- enough that I feel I can rate the system (though that is a hard thing to do!)...  The pieces are limited, but the dynamic ability of being able to use them for a variety of things is quite clever.  I want a nicely printed, bound, color book with the games designed in one happy location.  This folder I'm filling up with rulesets is already showing some wear.  I'm looking forward to playing more!

A very good idea. I wish I had the time to try all those promising games! But, for now, I am more enclined to wait until they become well-tested, polished games.

A good set of pieces to make various games out of. Surprisingly limited sometimes by the pieces themselves, with games held back by what pieces have to be used based on what's available.

There is a lot of gaming in one piecepack. A real bargain when you buy a set.  I enjoy a number of the solitaire games, which is the main reason I bought a set.  With so many new games being designed, this system will go on a long time.  An extra point for the way the game is open to everyone to contribute to.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I like this game system a lot (that's what I'm rating here). It's simple but allows for very different types of games to be implemented. There are about 150 games designed for it and it's very portable, so it's perfect for trips. And it's an excellent design tool. I've made some games for the system. I find working with this "limited" set of components really helps the ideas focus and take shape...

All that with a system you can download and print for almost nothing. Talk about value for money...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Much untapped potential, not only in the Piecepack itself, but in its synergistic possibilities with other game systems.
There's something delightfully old-fashioned about it, and it feels like what it is: a family game setup that also appeals strongly to the game-designer and DIY crowds.
It benefits from expansion, which makes more game design possibilities feasible - for instance, greater ranges of numbers, iconography for unique tiles, and so on.

I love the idea of a universal gameset based on an open source model. However, most of the rules I've seen for piecepack are way too Candyland for me -- nothing that's going to get my testosterone up.

A blessing. The set of pieces is EXTRAORDINARILY versatile - printing it along with the expansions means not only being able to play all the games being designed for it (try for instance Chameleon, Chaos Cruisers, Decay, Hanging Gardens, The "In" Crowd, New City or Virus Fight... these hardly have anything in common), but also being able to play or adapt lots of other games, traditional or not (Paradice and Jati can be played with two piecepacks... money saving, isn't it?).

The material cost of it, or even the hour spent on making one on cardboard using the model in their own site, is virtually nothing compared with the amount of fun and brain massage that this little wonder can deliver.

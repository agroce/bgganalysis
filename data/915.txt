I had very high hopes but they were not met. I don't know...maybe we aren't playing it right. Maybe we aren't asking the right types of questions. But ultimately it always comes down to Clue-type questions. "Do you have so-and-so?" or "How many monks with beards do you have?" Didn't really care for it.

I really enjoy this game. The game truly is won based on what questions you ask to other people and what information you are able to extract from the questions. Definitely on my top 20, will always play enthusiastically.

Love the theme (brought up Catholic) and the visual presentation is just beautiful. It plays fast and there are subtle layers of strategy. The mechanics far surpass Clue (Cluedo) as you need to strategize before each round as to how you are going to use your 4 turns because you can only do a couple of things per round and then you're called back for Mass. The victory point system is also slick as you can win in this game without deducing the exact culprit but instead make good revelations. A really good time for 3 players with an hour or less.

RATING: 4
In theory the notion of constructing a question that, when answered, will help you but be of no use to your opponents is exciting. But for practical purposes you are best served by not asking complex questions and not asking about anything except the cards a player currently has. In the end it's nothing but a turgid Clue knock off.

This is a game that's a lot of fun and will draw new people into the hobby.  It's just what we expect from DOW - gorgeous pieces, simple rules which hide a bit of depth, quick and breezy playing time.
I can imagine that everyone from your grandama, next-door neighbour, teenagers and gamers would enjoy this.  You can be quite clever and make it hard for others to see what you are up to, or you can be more "in your face" and attempt to steal other people's cards.  It's certainly the most fun sleuthing game I've played and I like the fact that it can have lots of variations.  DOW are very good at that sort of thing.  On their web-site there are lots of ideas for using the spare cards and for varying the rules.  I've used "the killer strikes again" and employ a twist whereby when the "Sing Brother Michael" card comes up, it also signifies that for that round only all Revelations can be made in secret on pieces of paper.  You can play with or without the chanting, but it's great fun if you do...and fun should be, after all,  one of the most essential ingredients of gaming...sometimes I think it's a bit overlooked by some folks here, but it never is in DOW games.  I guess the only complaint is that it can be a bit slow with more players.

I thought this was really obscure at first but after quite a few games it went to another level of how to word your clues as to how to get information for yourself without revealing anything to the others. Works well and is a fun experience, especially if you play with me and I forget to put a suspect under the board.

So much fun, just don't play it too much. This is a game you have to pull out of the closet when everybody feels like playing it. In my game group that wont mean every week. But we we do decide to play it, its extremely fun, and we play it 2 or 3 times in a row.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.2
In theory, I should love this game.  But I have three gripes.  First, the many chaotic possibilities of the game aren't often realised (people tend to stick to a fairly narrow track in going around the abbey).  Second, the game is unusually dependent on nobody ever making an error in replying to a question, on pain of the session being ruined for someone - and since it's themed as a semi-gateway, inattentive error is a real danger.  Third, it's just too chancy at the end to make the previous eliminative deduction feel vindicated - often people try guessing from a small set, rather than waiting it completely out, and whether they win or lose the thing can be over in an unsatisfying way.

RATING: 6.5
Fun game, but it is much better with one of the suggested variants:

Do NOT play with the Library.....the Library cards are horribly broken in comparison with all the other powers in the game.  For example, they let you flip hands with a player, or look at a player's hand, thus giving you a massive advantage in terms of information.  Also: it worked better (and faster!) when we played the variant of moving up to 3 spaces per turn (not 2), and only having 3 turns per round (not 4).  You get to about the same amount of useful areas, but it just takes less time.

Very nice looking deduction game from Bruno Faidutti. Fun game to play with 3 or more players. A bit random which does seem odd for a deduction game but it doesn't decrease my enjoyment of the game by a lot. There are a few small varients out there that cut down on the randomness a bit. The components in the game are also really nice.

The theme of this game attracted me to get it.  It took me a while to be able to track this game down to buy.  I have a lot of high expectation for this.  When started playing, it feels very fun and thematic.  Problem with group that I 1st played with is that they spend a lot of time trying to ask smart questions, then another one try to ask another smart question back.  It just takes too long for a turn to be completed.  Our first game ended around 2+ hours.

I'm not sure how to play this to be fun, perhaps we took it too seriously and too greedy to ask smart question.

RATING: 7
In a nutshell: it's Clue meets Guess Who?.  All questions are asked and answered publicly, though, so the better you can work the Guess Who? aspect of the game, the better you'll do in a multiplayer game.  

Cards get passed around fairly quickly, so you'll have to be more careful about your questions than Clue, since you want to learn what you need to before everything gets passed around.

An improvement on Clue, with more interesting bits (though still simple enough to play with the family) and a delightful lack of roll-and-move, but ultimately the core of the mystery mechanic remains "Ask your neighbors about their hands until you eliminate all but one possibility".

A good game in good company to have a pleasant couple of hours. But I prefer streamlimed games and not very fiddly ones like these. Besides I still don't know how to play this game well. Maybe you'll have to listen to the other players questions very well. If you add them all together it might become clear who is the perpetrator. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Very nicely produced, a better version of Cluedo. After one play, I think you need to figure out ways to ask questions that only help you and not the other players who will overhear the answers.

Not generally a fan of mystery games and I have a couple of better ones now, so having not played since 2008 traded away.

(NB Remove the two event cards that require players to sing. These don't fit the feel of the rest of the game at all: strange to have just two "silly" cards. Better to have a larger number, and make this a real part of the game (ideally an optional one), or don't have it at all.)

RATING: 6
A nice deduction game. Superior to Clue because the suspects have several characteristics to figure out. Also has a good system for allowing partial guesses. I like the tempo of the game, the way each turn starts in the chapel and sort of "spreads" over the board from there. Cute theme, especially when played to the hilt.

My first play of this one was a real brain burner.  We were all noobs to the game and I feel that it really dragged.  Despite that we were all discussing what we could have done differently and I'm looking foward to another crack at this one. Update: I just can't seem to make this one work for me.  I am nowhere close to making an accuasation when the game ends.  Score changes from 7.75 to 7
Update from a 7 to a 6 and I've traded it away.

The comparison has been made before that MotA is Clue on steroids.  While this is true, it doesn't express the true beauty that is this game.  There's a defined end, there's a time limit.  There's rigid rules of movement for tactical planning, but chaotic elements in the cards for surprises.  Then there's the questioning and card passing - so much information is encoded simply in the cards that you pass, and reasons for wanting a large hand AND for wanting a small hand.  This is not a casual game - it requires constant vigilance.

I like this game because it goes beyond Clue in the deductive game.  There are some problems with this game but I enjoy playing it when I get a chance.  I don't like the movement aspect and would like to move further.  Was soured on this game though thus the lower rating when I played it with some kids and it dragged out because it was a chore to get them to ask the right type of questions.  Probably my fault in teaching the game but was like pulling teeth at times.  Hope to do better next time.

I still think Clue gives you a better chance of actually figuring out who the culprit is.  This game gets too messy after too many cards have been passed around.

Finally played it without exchanging cards but showing them instead.  It was much more enjoyable this way and played a lot more as a deduction game.  I think my family enjoys this more now without the chaos.

RATING: 6
Thematically, this is a hit.  It easily draws from its similarity to The Name of the Rose and that legacy brings it credibility.  Does it hold its own as a mystery game?  It is a modern take on Clue(do) and shows improvements due to the general advances of the hobby.  Production quality is top notch.  But the basics of clue discovery really boils down to how the players interact and how much they are in the spirit of the game.  If approached dryly, the game will respond in kind.  It is a fun enough game, but time may not shine so favorably on it in the long haul.

RATING: 7.5
A fun and flavorful evolution of Clue.  As is typical for Days of Wonder you get a lot of colorful toys to play with when you open the box.  As is typical of the genre you will be wading through limited information in order to discover the one killer.  You also have a wealth of movement options on yoru turn that gives the game a nice strategic angle.  The amount of information to wade through in order to discover the criminal in the Abbey is dizzying -- so make sure you have good "System".

There are a couple cards in the event deck you may consider removing before starting the game depending on the sort of group you play with.  Some of them are a lil silly.  If you have a lot of RPG types it will be okay, but less flamboyant players will balk at being forced to sing songs in the middle of their game night :)  

update:  one word of warning.  The game is designed to encourage people to ask complicated and confusing questions (so that the answers dont reveal information to everyone at the table), if someone makes a mistake in their answer (or lies) it can basically ruin the whole game.

it's a major bummer when that happens.

Name of The Rose Lite. I really like this game as it plays like the thinking-man's Cludeo. It's a good party game as the rules are simple enough and it's easy to convince non-gamers to give it a try if you describe it as a more challenging version of Cludeo.

Rating for the new Days of Wonder edition. Amazing production quality but ultimately not my type of game. Some of the library cards are way too powerful but without them it's very difficult to make this a true deduction game, which is what I think this is supposed to be...I'm glad I didn't end up buying my own copy.

Strange mix of Guess Who and Cluedo. I'm not keen on the random elements, it makes it very difficult to logically work out 'whodunnit'. All the players pretty much arrive at the answer at the same time and then its just a race to the other side of the board.

Can at times be random with the card passing.  However, the theme is outstanding and everyone I have played this with really gets into it.  Trying to learn how to properly phrase questions is a skill that is still being developed.  I think that paying more attention to other people's questions can more quickly bring about an accurate accusation.

I like the basic idea here and the theme comes through pretty strong, but that’s countered by an unacceptable level of chaos that I don’t want in a deduction game. This is predominantly due to the fact that the cards in players hands change fairly frequently making it almost impossible to track information with any degree of certainty.

As some have said, "Clue on steroids."  I agree, but I still enjoy the ride.  So much better than Clue.  I love the theme, the cards, and the interaction.

Similar to clue set with mid-evil monks- one change I like is that it allows people the opportunity to guess a trait of the killer to score points making it possible to win without being the person to correctly guess the killer.  Would play again, but not for a while.

Hmmm.  I need to play this one again a few more times, because at it stands I think this is just a boring game that basically goes on until the endgame, and then it is all about being at the right place at the right time because everyone seems to figure out whodunnit at the same time.  I think we need to get better at asking questions that are sneakier.

My favorite owned game!! If you enjoy Clue or any other deduction games, you will absolutely love this!!! It takes the deduction aspects of Clue, adds much more strategy (in the form of cards with special powers) and combines it into an amazing package. And the board and components are top notch, also (color evidence pads!). Now you know why I love this game, manowarplayer!

Two playings.  My impression is that this is less a deduction game (although there are elements of one) and more a party game.  It positively drips flavor, and is a lot of fun to play, but doesn&#039;t even come close to Sleuth for a deduction game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I thought I would like this game, but after two games of trying to be as clever and diligent as possible in discovering the culprit, I'm fairly convinced that it just comes down to 90% luck. There is so much forced exchange of information between players (especially once people start passing 3-5 cards per round) that it feels next to impossible to discover any score-able information well before anyone else. The last game I played I had no choice but to take a 50/50 guess at the end, where I would win by guessing right and lose by guessing wrong. Not fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Very good mystery solving game.
A bit dragging in length but has very interesting mechanisms that bring new experience every time you play: every time it's about finding a good way to ask questions without revealing too much all the while learning a lot to beat your opponents.

This kicks clue's ass so very very hard, it's not even funny.

It has the same elements of clue, but it has so much more going on with it that it really takes the mechanic of it to a new level where there is no comparison in my opinion.

I'm almost willing to put this one down as a 10.

Playingtime is good, it doesn't seem to drag on at all. I also like the Mass parts of the game when you need to give more and more of your cards away, makes for some nice decision making. And the revelation part is nice as well.

The components of this game are awesome, absolutely top-notch.  I just wish that the questioning of other players was a bit more regimented, we always get lost with that part of the game.  The game has a tendency to run a bit long, and I don't really enjoy the end-game as it often seems to boil down to more than one player racing to make an accusation and whoever gets there first wins.  It's a mixed bag, because there are moments I love in some games, but then moments I wish would just end other times.

One play was fun.  I played poorly but enjoyed the experience.  I want to try it again.  It feels much harder to determine the culprit than in Clue because of the shifting cards and other nuances of the game.

It's taken a few games and a better understanding of how to play this well, but it's growing on me.  The key seems to be careful consideration of what you've SEEN vs. what you've deduced, and a willingness to take some chances and not wait for the perfect deduction.  It's also very social, which is a big plus for me.  Just ditch the stupid "plainsong" card.

Played this at the boardgame club September 2004.  We were 6 players.  First of all the artwork and material is top class !  Regarding the game we thought i difficult to find good strategies... with the cards moving all the times between the players it in our opinion it was hardly possible to get anything out of questions other than "do you have this munk ?".  The disadvantage of the latter question is that everybody receives this info at the same time...

I think mystery express fixes a lot of these issues, but mystery of the abbey is fun... I personally think a case should solved, not let to fate.

This game is a close 2nd for my favorite Whodunit; however, it dropped a notch to 8 due to Mystery Express, which doesn't suffer from the unfortunate side-effect of someone inadvertantly hurting the game by answering questions based on what they have conjectured not just what they know. When playing with people who track things carefully (for seen/known versus conjectured), this one is a notch higher as a "9", but it can be frustrating with someone who doesn't track things carefully.

Beautifully produced game that starts with promise.  Then people start drawing cards and you discover how wildly they vary in power.  You put that annoyance to the side to concentrate on taking good notes and working on logical deductions.  THEN everybody passes cards and all of a sudden you're practically back to square one in terms of deductions.  Seriously, people playtested this?  I have no idea how in the world this can be marketed as a deduction game.

I'm so disappointed by this game.  I really WANT to like it.  I like clue, sleuth, and other deductive games.  The "ask any question you want" element in this game is brilliant.  The theme is good, pieces are good, board looks great.

Unfortunately, they suck all of the strategy and interest out of the game and turn it into a completely random affair with the silly passing around of cards.  What on earth made them think that was a good idea?   How are you supposed to use incremental information gained if the location of the information is moving around every 2 seconds in a hidden manner?   Perhaps there are some SUBTLE strategies in determining the probabilities of what people may have, but a lack of certainty makes forming chains of deductions completely useless.   

We played in a 6 player game where you ended up having NO hidden cards, so perhaps the game works a little better with 3-4 players when you can hide information.

They could have had a brilliant game on their hands, but instead ruined it with a bonehead design decision.   Makes me sad.

Oh, and what is with having to return to the hall every 3 turns?   You can't plan ANTHING with such a lame and arbitrary decision.

RATING: 7
I like this game, but keep the player count down: 4 should probably be considered the maximum. 6 players is long and pretty tedious as question after question is asked with little meaningful result as everyone desperately tries to seek a couple pieces of information.

Don't play this game if you don't have a tolerance for chaos. The balance on the Library and Scriptorium cards is dubious, at best. I think it works in the context, where players still have a lot of interesting activities to do, and it's just not that sort of a game. But there is no question the random element is substantial and can be unbalancing.

Also, there is a lot less deduction here than you might think. Cards move around so quickly from hand to hand that to try to track everything and make deductions is basically impractical.

I like Mystery at the Abbey, because it's light and thematically solid, and with 4 at least, doesn't overstay its welcome. But it's no Fury of Dracula, that's for sure.

I love the theme (definitely has sort of an Umberto Eco thing going on) and the components, like most of DoW games, are great. The few silly cards that are thrown in (ie: everyone can only speak in plain chant this round) add a lot of fun to the game. The biggest downside to me is that everyone tends to find out who the killer was at the same time (thanks to the open questioning) so the end game is pretty much a race to the confessor. Still, I've always had fun with this and find it to be a big improvement to games like Clue.

This might rank higher if I was a bigger fan of deduction games but this is still a far cry better than Clue. There are more dimensions in its deductive "matrix" than simply person-room-weapon and the various game mechanisms associated with each of the different rooms allow for a fairly wide range of strategic approaches. Yet for all that it's not so complex that it shouldn't work well as a family-gamer crossover game. Production quality is excellent.

Fun themeatic deduction game. Easy to get non-gamers to play if you liken it to Clue. Helps that the production quality is stellar.

To me, the fun part is trying to figure out how to phrase questions so that I gain information and my opponents don't.

The scoring system is somewhat problematic, however. Making revelations rarely seems worth it even when you're sure, since it takes awhile to even get over to the room where you can make them. It's nice that the game wants to reward players for making smaller correct guesses, but it comes off as a bit fiddly and in my experience players tend to ignore it and the winner almost always ends up being whoever correctly identified the culprit. 

Definitely too chaotic for those who want pure deduction, but this does make for some interesting and unique strategies (figuring out which cards to keep or pass, etc.) - setting it apart from other deduction games. And DEFINITELY beats any other deduction game I've played on theme!

My family enjoys this game; it has a nice theme and it's a nice change from the other games we play.  However, it's frustrating when a player makes a mistake because it can throw off the entire game.  We've only played a few times, but each game someone has made a verbal mistake, and it's seriously affected the outcome.  This should not be played with children who need assistance or with people who are drinking; it doesn't work if somebody isn't tracking!

RATING: 8
Once again, a beautifully done DOW game. Rather like "Clue" on steroids, you're trying to solve the mystery of who killed one of the brothers at the Abbey. The twist is that each of the suspects has several defining characteristics, so good deductive reasoning is required. Can be confusing for newcomers, and if someone accidentally gives incorrect information during the game, the entire mechanism can be thrown off (I had a game where I had eliminated all suspects because of an incorrect response during game play).

A cross between Cluedo and Guess Who? The setting is evocotive of The Name of the Rose and the ability to make 'revelations' (wild guesses about the murderer) adds an interesting element to the scoring. I particularly like the random event card that requires everyone to communicate in plainsong or pay a penance. Hilarious! It's a shame that this is the only funny event. I'd have liked a few more in the same style. How about a 'vow of silence' card?

Why, oh why, did they put the event cards in there?  I like the strategic elements -- choosing not to answer a question, making revelations which may or may not be accurate, etc. -- but the event cards are just silly.  I appreciate silly games, but not mixed in with strategy games.  All players must chant instead of speak until the next mass?  Ugh.

I used to own this game and was really looking forward to playing it. Sadly, I was very disappointed in the gameplay itself. The artwork was magnificent and some of the card effects were great.

We would rather just play clue if we were going to play this.

Right now, this is my wife's favorite game. It's a little chaotic with all the swapping of the cards, but I think that's part of the charm. Very interactive, and a solid hit with the family. I can lose badly and still have fun.

However, we took out the card that demands everyone speak in Gregorian chant for a turn. That's a little excessive :)

Update: Dropped it to a "7." It's a good game, and glad to have the deductive mechanic in a game. But, we've played this a fair amount, and other games are distracting me.

Update: Dropped it to a 6 and eventually traded it in a math trade. This sat on the shelf for quite some time. My family was the primary audience, and they got a bit tired of the game. And, among "serious" gamers, there's too much randomness in the game. For me, Mystery Express essentially "fires" this game, and that's probably all I need for the games that follow the legacy of Clue's "missing card" mechanic.

Fantastic clue style game. The game has players passing increasing numbers of monk cards to each other each round and you have to spot which one is missing. You also get to ask the other players questions but its difficult to get useful answers without other players also getting information. So it seemed like everyone worked out the murderer at the same time and it was a race to get to the chapter house.

A great game... to play with non-gamers.  Spielfrieks tend to get wrapped around the axle and propose impossibly complex questions... resulting in confused answers.  High frustration factor.  As a result, I won't play this with most gamers, but as a gateway game, it will do just fine.

This is a pretty fun deduction game with some strategic options in the form of card management.  Sometimes it's very beneficial to avoid moving onto anothers space because you must ask a question... and if they choose to answer, they can ask a question you must answer in return.  Moving onto anothers space when I shouldn't have has hurt me a number of times.  I've had great fun with this game, and am looking forward to playing it again.  Days of Wonder is really coming on strong as a games company.

I was hoping for a game with more strategy than clue and I got it, but not to the degree I was hoping. It just feels kind of random. The "mass" mechanic is very frustrating as it causes the player to have to reset back to starting position, essentially losing progress that was made, every four turns. It is a light game and can be enjoyed, but not something I would want to keep going back to on a regular basis.

There is a situation this game is perfect for, although I don't think its necessarily going to get a lot of play with a hardcore gaming group.  But after dinner, its far superior to most party games and fits that niche quite well.  The components and artwork are compelling and top notch (as is the norm with Days of Wonder it seems). The game play is fun.  There's not a lot of deep strategy, but the game keeps you engaged and there isn't really down time at all. It can take a little experience or genius to figure out just how to word questions to benefit you and not everyone else. I'm not sure we have figured that out yet.

This game doesn't suck, but I didn't really care for it.  Part of it is that I don't seem to like Clue-type games that well, but part of it is this game.  It is over-long for certain, and it is also really hard to get through the game without someone screwing up in such a way that no one can get the right answer.  The question asking mechanism is designed in such a way that you spend a lot of time asking either fairly pointless questions or ones that give away too much of what you know.  Maybe I couldn't strike the right balance, but neither could anyone else that I was playing with.

I've only played the game once to try it out (but it didn't really grab anyone in my group). I had the DoW version.  The bits (as usual with DoW) were great.  I traded this game so I now won't really have an opportunity to play again.  Anyway, I'm going to rate this game based on the one playing.  This is probably the first game where everyone in my playing group collectively (but unspoken) decided that we were not going to play this game again.  For us, I think there was TOO much thinking involved that it sucked the fun out of it for us.  I think it is also a little chaotic (which may contribute to the "too much thinking" feeling).  I might play again if I ever get the chance but it would have to be with a different group.

This is far and away the best game in its class.  The tension toward the end can be mind-reeling as you narrow your suspect list down.  It doesn't seem to be quite as much fun with 3 players due to reduced interaction, so be warned.  The production is marvellous, the art is great, and the theme is perfect.  This is also Bruno's best game, but not Serge's (Mare Nostrum!).

A long game of Clue on steroids.  Great theme and wonderful components, but this game of deduction wasn't worth my (read: my wife's) fifty bucks.  It seems that Mystery of the Abbey has all of the trappings of a great newbie game, but then inlcudes all of the special room rules to confuse the hell out of em.  Maybe adding one room's rules to the game each time would ease a nongamer into it.  I don't know ... this one falls into a weird area.  Someone new to the sport would be confused, and a veteran gamer would definitely play something else.  Maybe there's an in-between group of people that love this one.  Plus it's quite long.

On the good side being a logic deduction game it is different from most other games. But it is similar to Code 77, Sleuth, Clue and others of that nature. So if you like that type of game you'll get better mileage with this game than I did. There's nothing really wrong with it. I just am not a big fan of that type of game. On the other hand it is nice to have one just to pull out for some variety.

A lot more interesting than Cluedo! Wasted turns are fairly uncommon (but still possible) and some of the cards make for an entertaining experience. However I'm sure that some cards could get tired after a while (like having to melodically chant everything for four rounds). I think it's a fun game to get into character with. Great quality components as is usual for Days of Wonder.

RATING: 6
Sometimes it feels that the slew of information is too much to reasonably keep track of. The randomness of certain Scriptorium events (such as the one that gets rid of all Crypt cards) damages enjoyment. However, the aspect of mutual questioning is very enjoyable as everyone struggles to phrase their questions in a way that will end their turn with them gaining more knowledge than their opponent did. Also, it has a fully functional bell. How can you not love that?

We first found Alibi and enjoyed it. MotA is like Alibi but with better theme (the THEME is amazing!), more player interaction (including fun strategic choices on the board), bonus cards and rooms with fun powers, and cooler options with asking questions of other players. The ONE thing that I like maybe a little better about Alibi is how the game amps up towards the end into a frenzy of trying to be the first accuser without guessing too much. You get some of that in MotA, but not quite like Alibi. Still, I really, really like the experience I get when I play MotA. A lot of laughing, head scratching, some take-that, but not horribly. Probably one of the best games to really pull players into the theme.

Clue made so convoluted it doesn't increase the amount of skill required but the amount of luck. I'll give it another try but I expect my rating may drop.

On top of that it is actually broken without the house rule that you can not just repeatedly go to the whatever room and say the killer is fat then as soon as possible afterwards say the kller is thin etc since the net points is actually a gain. If one person made all these kind of statements they wold actually beat the player who correctly identifies the murderer and without having done ANY deduction at all.

RATING: 3
After playing twice I found myself beginning to worry that seriously trying to deduce the killer is a lost cause. You can't ask meaningful questions without benefiting your opponents, meaning that it all depends on obligatory card swapping very late into the game. By then everyone is just eager to get it over with. If you ask straightforward questions, the game is over before you know it and will feel like a modern and rather pointless 'Guess Who'. I didn't play the game much thereafter. After several years, someone posted a type of question which is really valuable to you without giving away one bit of information to the other players. However, it requires you to keep track of the cards you give to other players quite meticulously, and the suspect sheets are not capable of handling that information. I let the game go shortly after.

I suspect the main appeal of this game (if not the very reason why it was created in the first place) lies in the fact that it allows you to roleplay Umbeco's story quite well. There is a suspect, you can 'investigate', and there are events which help and hinder you. Then the aspect of finding the killer becomes far less important: instead it becomes about getting roaring drunk while citing memorable movie quotes and speculating on the gruesome nature of the Catholic Church in those and later times. As a game however, avoid.

It's like they say-- Clue on crack.  Play with a cup of coffee and keep careful notes.  Questions are important, make them count.  Just when you think your brain will explode, the cards start flying and you get the pieces of the puzzle you need to make the game REALLY interesting.  Fun cards seem a little silly, but this game needs them to keep it light.

Drips atmosphere + theme. Interesting gameplay - though if you don't limit the complexity of questions people can ask / encourage them to not take too long to formulate questions, it can take a [b]long[/b] time. Even with moderately prompt play, it's not short, which is why it doesn't hit the table more often, I think.

Production: One of the most beautiful games I’ve had the pleasure of playing.  No expense spared on the board, pawns, or score pads, and the cards are functional.  Play: I’ve been searching for the great deduction game, but this isn’t it.  It is entertaining, and very thematic, but the various cards make it lighter than I would like, and I am just not adept at formulating questions that help only me.  (3+0+2) (1 play)

This game is what Clue should be. There are lots of great mechanics that you can chose by going to the proper room.

RATING: 7
I haven't played Clue since I was very young, and probably won't play it again unless a kid requests it.  However, I'll likely still recommend this one instead.  Dice are no longer used for movement, and each subsequent round brings the game closer to the end like a timer.  Open ended questioning for all to hear makes for a far more interactive game than the former as well.  All in all, just fun!

RATING: 3
Deduction games are inherently fragile.  They give each player a part of the solution, and depend upon them giving an accurate response when asked.

In Mystery of the Abbey, you not only need to rely on the other players to give you an accurate response, you need to rely on them having made perfect notes along the way.  One mistake and the entire game falls apart.

Two hours is way too long for something this easily broken.

Pretty fun, played with group aged 12 to adults.  I like the setting a lot, but the movement mechanic is sort of weak, and doesn't feel really like the best mechanic to have used for action choices... a rondel might have been better, I don't know.

Downrated to 5 after awhile. My taste and game collection have moved on.

RATING: 8
Game comparable to Clue, but with more ways to obtain information; questioning will be difficult in the beginning; not purely deductive, certain dose of luck in the game, but also managing your hand of suspect cards; lot of player interaction; useful house rule is keeping track of monks you have actually seen the card of and monks eliminated on your sheet.

This game has very nice materials and a very colorful board.  The theme is interesting with each room of the abbey offering a unique action.  

Players are monks who go around the abbey trying to figure out who the killer is by taking actions and asking other players questions.  Each player uses process of elimination to make revelations and accusations, which score them points at the end of the game.  Guessing incorrectly will give you negative points.

This game is somewhat fun, and I could be talked into it on occasion.  The good thing is that once players are familiar with the game, it shouldn't last terribly long.  However, I don't think there is much depth to the deduction part of the game.  It seems mostly guesswork, without having much of an idea what to ask.

Determine which monk is the murderer by asking questions and keeping track of information (such as the sect, the hood, the size and the beardedness) of the monks you know to be innocent.

This is a pretty good, fairly light game. A tricky one, too.

A lot has been said about this game, that it is too random. I have to disagree. This is one of the best deduction games we have ever played. The key is asking questions. If you ask the right questions you get the right answers, and are able to discover traits about the murderer, and then make revelations like: "The murderer was Franciscan. " or "He was a Fat man." That's how you win, and even have fun.

We did not like some of the event cards however, one even required us to sing/chant our table conversation.

I felt like this could have been a better version of Clue.  However, it seemed like it was too hard to accumulate enough information because cards switched hands.

Tries really hard to be the successor deductive game to Cluedo/Clue and also tries to be the boardgame of the movie 'Name of the Rose'. It misses out (just) on both. The question based mechanic doesn't really achieve much beyond the standard have you x/y/z in your hand of Cluedo and then all deduction is randomised by the swapping of cards anyway. And it's not quite dark enough to invoke a Name of the Rose feel.

Still fun, but a near miss for me. SOLD

Only a few playings so far but looking forward to more. Still have not worked out a good method to record information and still having some trouble composing useful questions that don't give too much information to other playrs.

Umberto Eco meets Cluedo.  Fun, if rather chaotic, whodunnit.  Players roam a medieval abbey interacting with the rooms and other players trying to discover the identity of a murderous monk.  Points are awarded for making &quot;revelations&quot; about the monk (fat, hooded, etc) as well as for successfully identifying the culprit.  Some very powerful &quot;library&quot; cards and the continual passing of information from hand to hand make this no Cluedo!  The theme and presentation (Days of Wonder) work wonderfully here.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
our initial play was disappointing.  It was difficult to come up with questions that would actually help you to eliminate suspects with any certainty.  I suppose the game requires you to gamble with guesswork a bit.  The playtime also seemed a bit long, and there weren't many interesting decisions to be made as far as where you move to.  It's especially disappointing because the quality of the components and art, as well as the interesting theme, really had me looking forward to it.  I'll likely try to give it one more play before deciding whether it's worth keeping.

Update: traded away.

RATING: 6
A deduction game in the same vein as Clue, but for grownups.  As in Clue, the hidden suspect card is the murderer, and the suspects in the player's hands are innocent.  Players must deduce the monk's identity by questioning each other, and they can ask any question which does not require naming a specific suspect, so for instance "How many bearded monks do you have?" and "Have you ruled out Father Sergio?" are both legal, and even "Where are you headed now?" is valid.  Players receive points for determining specific features of the murderer (like "thin" and "bearded"), so it isn't an all-or-nothing win like in Clue.

It's true that it's a souped-up Clue.  That could be good or bad, depending on how much you like Clue.  It's also the kind of game that has strong appeal at first, but wanes over time, and replayability isn't that good, since the game becomes monotonous.

Clue with a better theme, more suspects, and more variety.  Highly rated by the entire group, although it suffered from one person's slightly inaccurate answer.  Will gladly play again.

UPDATE: Many years later and this game finally made it to the game table again as part of my "now that the kids are old enough, force them to play some older games" series. Starting to agree with some other users in that it takes too long for what should be a quick deduction game, and that it also potentially suffers from an over reliance on accurate note taking and players who don't make any errors in their answers. Still a great looking game that advances the genre that started with (for me) Clue, but there's probably a better option out there. Still, I'll gladly play ever once in a while.  Slight downgrade.

RATING: 5
I like the idea of a deduction game, however the clunky mechanics of this game really shows its age and the game drags on for far too long for what it offers.  Pitched as an updated and revised version of Cluedo/Clue, I really wanted to like this game, and for the first 30 minutes or so I did, but after an hour it started to feel tedious.  The mechanic of interviewing other players and taking notes, while feeling novel at first, started to feel like a chore after a while.  At first we thought we could just get by with a small piece of scrap paper, but we each later realized we really needed to be handed a notebook with an entire page devoted to each other individual player.  One player joked about needing to bring a computer and start an excel spreadsheet.  The game is less about strategy and more about luck and above all VERY CAREFUL NOTE-TAKING.  However, as someone pointed out, after cards are passed around at the end of certain phases, all previous notes become invalid, and its back to square one.  
Boardgamegeek lists this as a 120 minute game; that is WAY too long for this kind of check-characters-off-a-list type of game.  This type of party game should only last about 30 min; 60 min MAX.  Some of the cards drawn from walking into certain rooms seem very unbalanced from each another; some drew cards that allowed them to exchange cards with other players, others were practically useless.  All of the cards in this game need to be thrown out and completely re-written from scratch so that they are more balanced and carry equal weight.  The cards should be a mechanism to speed up the game and help us progress forward more quickly.  
The rules are also not very streamlined.  For what is basically a ‘party game’, we had to keep consulting the rulebook again and again for finicky little rules like the types of traits you can ask in certain situations but not in others; please make them all the same for simplicity sake!  We weren’t sure if we could take more than one crypt card or use several; does it matter?  And get rid of this ‘vow of silence’ thing; no one in our game used it as its pointless and just slows the game down more.  (I got a special card that allowed me to break someone’s “vow of silence”; Big deal!~ )  
And then there is the artificially tacked on scoring mechanism at the end.  2 point for going on record as guessing if a certain trait is correct, negative if you are wrong… etc.  Again, it feels like it was just added on at the last minute to just slow the game down more.  I really did have a curiosity at the end to see which was THE character, but when it came down to it, we each had a 50/50 chance and just kept going in and guessing until someone got it right and finished the game.  
Rating this game is hard and frustrating because there is a good game somewhere in here.  But the rules need to be streamlined, the special action cards completely re-written to make them balanced and much more progressive and generally ANYTHING done to make this game go faster.  With a run time of two hours, Mystery of the Abbey overstays its welcome and unnecessarily drags on for far too long.

Clever logic/mystery game with excellent theming. Would have scored it a 7, but the really immersive theme really boosted the fun for me. Love the little bell you ring for mass. Not sure if I like the fact you can declare that the murderer is fat one round, and thin the next to guarentee a point (-1 for incorrect guess, +2 for correct).

Got in a game trade. Can't wait to try it out.

Update:

Got the chance of trying it out for the first time and won. The game is similiar to Clue, but with more chrome. Components are very nice. Exchange cards and ask questions. Whenever possible give back the same card to the same person. It has cool ideas.

I would want to try the game again to get a better view of the different questions/answers being said during the game.

Update 2: Wasn't as much fun as I would of thought. Guess it isn't my kind of game.

Some downtime. Lots of random factors. Don't see replayability very high.

TRADED.

Beautiful new edition of the game. the game is fast paced and easy to learn and play.

[4 plays] I'm still not sure of my final judgment on this mystery chromefest.  I like deduction games, and this one is beautifully produced (typical Days of Wonder), with a wealth of exquisite thematic detail.  But after several plays, I still don't feel that I've figured out the best system for processing information, or how to use the questioning to my advantage.  The card-passing mechanic ensures that there is no stable information, which makes things difficult.

A deductive game that is just as much a social and interactive experience.  Coming up with good questions that don't give too much away to other players can be challenging though - this is one of the weaknesses of the game, because it makes it less accessible for new players.  Role-playing improves the game. The mechanic seems [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/152499]very similar[/url] to [gameid=1417], which has less theme and is pure deduction.

This is not a bad game, I'm just not good at it so it's a 5 for me. It has Mystery of the Abbey is a great theme and it's quite a clever deduction game for how you can ask for clues using characteristics in an effort to deduce things. Unfortunately, I'm just not good at this thing and was a couple levels behind others who were able to not just deduce what they saw/knew but what other people most likely knew. It's more effort than my little brain wants to make. I spent most of my game creating a unique notation system that involved penises on the monks pointing at the player to whom I passed the card.

This was a better game than I was expecting. I am not usually a fan of Faidutti, but I enjoyed this one. It wasn't just the DoW production either, but a truly fun game with many gameplay possibilities. I do think it tends to suffer from bouts of analysis paralysis, and some of the special cards are weird ( chanting for an entire round? funny in  cosmic encounter, but out of place in this game I felt.) Overall, I give it a 7.4

Boy, do I suck at this! I got like -29 points and everyone else got between +1 to +5... I have no idea how to ask questions. I'm like, "How many hooded monks have you crossed out?" and the answer is, "5" and I'm thinking, "Five, eh? Great. I have no idea what that means to me. Five."

RATING: 5
We only played this twice, each time with four players, so maybe I shouldn't judge yet, but we just didn't see the strategic depth.  It seemed that in each game, we all figured out the suspect at the same time, and it turned into a race to get back first.  Also, we were frustrated by the abruptness of being drawn back for "mass" every fourth turn.  This seemed to create a lack of rhythm and difficulty with not always being able to complete your tasks on that turn.  Maybe I need more play to appreciate this game (or maybe not), but I sold this anyway.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I really wanted to like this game as deduction games seem rare now. A few in my group who had played before were already hesitant but were willing to give another try. The game comes across as very dry and the questioning element either gave no useful info or gave away too much to everyone at the table. The game also artificially extended the game past the point where we knew who the killer was. It then became a race to declare any facts you could. Cards seemed mostly useless and not worth the amount of time it took and chance of bad events. Overall a very disappointing experience and the game will not be hitting the table ever again.

This may be the best deduction game I have ever played. Definitely a hit with the family (except my wife)! It is not quite so random as Clue and has a little more action to it than Martin Wallace's P.I. My mom even likes it, and she is not all that good at deduction games usually. And I traded it! It is the only game I have ever traded and regretted.

Cluedo with chaos. The theme works very well, monks asking questions when they meet, checking their cells or the confessional, doing penance. But the game really goes clockwise a lot. The flow of cards and hence information is mostly clockwise, so you need to concentrate on asking questions to your left. The VPs works well, I accused badly, but revealed well and finished 3rd on points. Interesting game.

RATING: 7
This game was first described to me as a sort of Clue on steroïds.  While this is almost true, I enjoyed it very much.  A better analogy in my mind is that this is the game that In the Name of the Rose would like to be.  Not to say that this game is as great a classic as the novel.  But the setting certainly fits the theme perfectly.  
I have the Days of Wonder version so the bits and look are top notch.  Much of the beauty of this game lies in the questions and how to ask them to get the most information from your opponents.  There are some cards that affect normal play giving a temporary advantage to a player.  However since all questions are asked out loud, hearing the questions and answers become useful for everyone.  The passing of suspects at each mass needs to be treated with extra caution as this is where the most definitive information is passed.  The trick is to pass cards that your neighbor has already seen.  Not always possible but that's the general idea.
One final thought: the object is to score points.  While finding out who is the murderer gives the most point, scoring on several revelations can be just as effective.  Be careful not to wait for too long before making yours.

The "evolution" of Clue... and not in a good way. Deduction games are fun once in a while, and this one has a bit more entertainment value for its "silly" factor (especially when the chanting event card shows up), but it doesn't really grab me (and I don't expect it to). Too bad, because the board is gorgeous, typical of Days of Wonder. *** UPDATE: The huge randomness in the game damages its deduction aspect so much that its game element is no improvement Clue, despite being prettier and more entertaining. Bad idea. Will have to check out Sleuth...

Clue is all grown up.  This is a nifty find-the-killer game that leaves a lot of room for the players to make it work.  You make up the questions to ask, so it takes some real imagination -- it's an open-ended sort of game mechanic, but the structure of the game is never compromised.  I find this game very difficult and frustrating, but am always willing to play it for some reason!

Did they, like, talk to practicing Catholics before putting this together?  ;) example, the "Mass" cards are divvied into none, compline, etc - those aren't the times of Mass - those are the different Hours for the Liturgy of the Hours - why not just call that prayer time?  Why is there a confessional not accessible from the inside of the church?  So weird.  Other illogical problems seen in just watching some reviews and looking at images.  Looks like it would be annoying.

edit: just saw a mention of a "Book of High Magic" card.  Wow.  So....  this game is not for practicing Catholics, and just further promotes misconceptions about Catholicism.  Got it.

Cluedo on steroids with a better richer theme and no annoying dice movement.  A nice sneaky enjoyable gateway game for newbies who were once familiar with Clue (or Cluedo as it was called in Oz).  Also nice touch that they make the scribble sheets available on the web as a colour PDF.  Just make sure before the start of play you all agree that you will clearly mark cards that you have actually seen compared to cards you have guessed can be eliminated! Although, in the right spirit, even when it goes wrong, this game can still be fun (07/03/09). UPDATE: Still a good game (so still rated an 8), just haven't had the opportunity to revisit much (24/12/11).

What beautiful bits it has! Despite the lightness of this game I find it to be intensely thought-provoking, and one of the few games in which I care what the other players are doing and thinking. I do find the deduction aspect to be challenging - if you're waiting for cards to be passed to you you'll lose, because I'll have solved the mystery by then.

One aspect of the game which I particularly enjoy is figuring out who my opponents think did it. If I can figure that out, and I think they're right, it's possible to steal the game from them. I don't think people appreciate how much fun that is :-).  You can also infer lesser information from trying to understand WHY people are asking particular questions, and ask them questions which let you confirm those suspicions. Once people get wise to those tricks you can start asking questions which throw suspicion on a character you have in your own hand, making it a game of bluff as well. Always intriguing and always fun.

It seems The Geek has a thing against deduction and memory games,  however I am quite fond of trying to figure out missing information.  Mystery of the Abbey plays alot like clue, yes their is more chaos by passing cards around.  But I see it as a mechanic to emulate the idea that witnesses can have changing accounts of what has happened.  people complain about library cards being to powerful, but I disagree, because in order to get into the library you have to have the least available information.  i think the biggest flaw is people not taking a vow of silence when asked the name of a specific monk.  Anyways, I think this is a wonderful, light game of deduction.  Well done Bruno.

This is a very enjoyable game. Yes, it's difficult to make it a purely deductive game, but I'm not entirely sure it was meant to be, esp. given the descriptions of the archtypes on the folders. Unfortunately, the Library cards are too random to be fairly balanced, and one lucky draw there really changes the outcome too much. (But it's fun!)

RATING: 6
Still to make my mind up over this one.  The first game dragged due to newness, slow thinking times and people who continually took the vow of silence and we didn't officially get it finished in an hour and a half after explanations.  The concept is cool, though.  I think it will work well as a clever strategy game once the suggested random elements are removed.  The logic of reaching a conclusion through clever questions was confusing, though, and it came down to elimination and probability since we had a fixed finish time due to the venue being a local pancake shop that was closing for the night.  It has distinct replayability by using new strategies of both movement and questions asked.  I'm keen to try this again.

A fun, chrome-filled version of Clue.

In many ways, Mystery solves many of the problems of Clue. The board and the movement are much more smartly done.

However, the blessing and the curse of the game is that you pass cards. This helps force an endgame but it also reduces the deductive elements of the game.

This game is like the cooler and more likable older sibling of "Clue." You are pitted against other monks who, like the Abbot, are initially the only ones who have a rock solid alibi when faced with a horrible murder at the monastery/abbey.

The Mass aspect of the game really mixes things up and creates some strategic planning of movement as well as actually speeds the game up through the card exchanges which occur at this phase of the game.

Unlike many games, Mystery of the Abbey has a reasonable number of phases and is very easy to learn and get into.

The expansion "The Pilgrim's Chronicles" is cute; the added cards make for some fun moments in gameplay.

Clue was a fun game when I was a kid but I probably wouldn't play it now unless with a specific group (or kids). Mystery of the Abbey, while similar, is definitely something I'd play. Options with movement, special event cards, a beautiful board and theme and a lot more levels on which to exercise your deductive reasoning, Mystery of the Abbey is fun - and especially with the right group of people.

It's a nice idea and really works if one wants to kill some time chasing a murderer on a board. Perhaps I'm not the right target group since for me personally, there was too little going on ("just" moving around and gathering clues), so I personally didn't feel satisfied despite being in a mood to play something light and less serious. I find card games like Geschenkt (or Trendy!) more challenging and exciting, and I could of course complete 5-10 of those games while the group in the other room still struggles with their clues.

RATING: 6
The Days of Wonder production is superb -- I just wish I liked the game more.

I'm a fan of deduction games, but (surprisingly) Mystery of the Abbey isn't really for players like me. The movement of cards around the table make it very difficult to perform any sort of in-depth analysis. Instead, you make rudimentary eliminations until you narrow the field down to a few suspects and then make a guess.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

If &quot;Clue&quot; is high school, then &quot;Mystery of the Abbey&quot; is university.  A smarter 
&quot;whodunnit&quot; game that eliminates the &quot;where&quot; and &quot;with what.&quot;  Players must find the culprit out of a possible 30 suspects, divided and described by five characteristics (fat or skinny, bearded or clean-shaven, hooded or non-hooded, in addition to three separate orders and three separate levels in each order).  Players glean information through questioning other players in &quot;quid pro quo&quot; fashion.  The game is steeped in &quot;Name of the Rose&quot; flavor, and the interaction via interrogations and cardplay is perfect.  A great gateway game for non-gamers, family, and Clue fans alike.

[Initial Impression: 6]
Although I generally dislike deduction games as a genre (see my comments on Sleuth), I find Mystery of the Abbey to be one of the most interesting examples.  Unlike most deduction games, this one strips away the randomness of die rolls or card draws that govern movement or the questions you can ask, making it less a sprint to find the missing monk and more a free-form distance run in which you try to lead opponents down the wrong path so that you reach the goal first.  There are few restrictions on questioning, so you can try to dream up the most informative question possible (however, get too detailed and there is a risk the other player will choose not to answer).  Because the players switch cards relatively often, the search space keeps changing, and will narrow at an ever-increasing pace for all players.  Much of the strategy becomes not so much about trying to deduce the missing monk, and more about attempting to keep information from other players by choosing to not answer certain questions or to try not to pass off certain cards.  There are also multiple ways to score, so that even deducing one dimension will help you (or you can mislead others by announcing a knowingly incorrect dimension at the cost of negative points).  Because the search space changes so often and players are actively trying to keep certain pieces of information from one another, the game requires a detailed note-taking system and it can be quite a long time before someone finds the right answer.  Although it is not a recipe for a particularly good game in my opinion, it is probably the best of its class. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Having fond memories of Clue when I was a kid, this game hits a sweet spot with me.  I like the fact that if you're not incredible at deduction, there are game mechanics that pull you along the path of the correct culprit.  You can bluff during the game, but you cannot lie if someone asks you a question, which I think fits the theme.  When asking questions, I like the fact that the responder can either not answer or ask a return question that must be answered.  Seems to play well across its player range.  Definitely in my Top 10...

I was initially very interested in this as I liked the deduction theme but was disappointed that this was made almost worthless by the card passing. As cards start to pass you have only a limited time to ask questions before you cannot deduce much from them. Maybe I was not being imaginative enough with the questions. However the production quality was first rate and praise must be given for this. Instead of a passing card perhaps a revealing card mechanism where you are forced to reveal more of you cards each turn?

This game is kinda like Clue but there are 24 different suspects.  Cards get passed around which makes it difficult to keep track of things.

I sold this game to James.

This is a fun deduction game, that takes Clue to another level.  I like the bizzare events than make you take a vow of silence, or chant all your questions.  I love the inclusion of Theme, and how making good suggestions is often better than deducing the final solution.  

The game does have religious conotations, and may possibly offend some.  It is also chalenging as the information you get expands geometrically each turn.  

My copy is made from Sculpey and the Web available PDF files from Faludi's website.  These were available before an english version of the game was planned, so I don't know if they are still there.

A deduction game. Interesting theme, but the mechanics just don't feel right. Initial rating a '2'.

Update (01/20/12): IIRC, this is similar to Clue where investigators run around from room to room, asking questions about physical characteristics of the perpetrator. It is a race to identify the suspect first through deduction and eliminating options. It's clear that I don't care for deduction and guessing games. It's still a '2'.

Tries to be a deduction game, but all that card swapping means that you can't really deduce who the killer is, you either take a lucky guess or are lucky enough to see more cards than your opponents. Allowing players to take a 'vow of silence' prevents you asking a really killer question too.

The idea is a good one, and I love the theme, but there is very little here to sink your teeth into.  It is possible to have fun playing with the right group, but the game simply does not process in a very game-like way...  most of the information you can acquire is unreliable and ambiguous at best, and once bad information is introduced into the game, it is very difficult for the experience to recover.

This game has a fatal flaw, IMO. One person answers a question incorrectly by mistake (mishearing the question or taking poor notes) and everything is chaos and random. 

And, at best, it's mediocre when it doesn't break down.

I kind of feel really badly for rating this a 2.  Kind of...  This game is so easily broken by an honest mistake that you might end up wasting two hours with no actual hope of ANYONE winning.  Other than the production values, which for Days of Wonder is always top-notch, the whole game is crap.  It's clue with a whole bunch of meaningless junk that does nothing save make it longer and progressively more mindless.  Maybe I don't like deduction games a whole lot, but everyone I know personally who has played this have agreed.  Lame.

Deduction games are an area that I have very light experience at.  This one struck me as intriguing, but not exactly something I need to own.  There seem to be a lot of unneeded card play and silly board movement.  The whole game pretty much came down to the questions being asked and the events at the end of each Mass.

I did like the idea of the deduction game, but I'll continue looking elsewhere.  Maybe Timbuktu?

If you're in the spirit of the abbey it can be a lot of fun. If you play with people who are uptight about winning or being sent to penance it really isn't fun.

I read through the rules and thought that this game does what Clue doesn't. It makes it simple and quick. None of this silly rolling dice to move around the board. The artwork is very nice and the theme works as well. Though like Clue once you run out of players sheets you need to get replacements.

The first time I played this I couldn't see the point - you give the other players so much information and the cards change hands so much that it seems impossible to play with  a strategy. But after a couple more games it has become on of my favourite deduction games, there's a lot of room in here for player skill and the game has nice ways of encouraging the end of the game to come around before people get bored.

This game is beautiful with quality components and artwork.  It is described by many as a clue-like deduction game (a genre that I would not mind seeing more of).  However, the game as executed seems to be having an identity crisis.  It wants to be deduction but destroys almost all aspects of deduction by introducing card passing and other random elements in an attempt to make this a "fun" family/party game with wacky antics such as bell-ringing and the possibility of singing.   I still had fun and the group still seemed to have fun.  However, this is no more than an ok game that I would only play if others wanted to.

RATING: 6
The game is a fun version of clue but too long for what it is as is and very chaotic/random, might be better to allow more movement to shorten the game time.

I did find it hard to "deduce" anything, questions always seemed to be too general or too specific and it was hard to ask something in the middle. You could try to start narrowing stuff down but then everyone starts passing cards around and that throws it all for a loop. Some of the library buildings are too powerful also, it might be better off to exclude them. It does manage to get some laughs so tweaking this to taste might be  worth while.

Can't see it being very fun at all with 3 and barely with 4; 5 or 6 good though.

After owning this for 5+ years I've found that we hardly ever play it anymore. The two primary issues:

Initial Rating: 6.0 (July 2010)

I don’t like Faiduti´s games (my highest rated Faiduti game is Citadels.) This was one of the first games I played so I had high expectations, but I was very disappointed. My initial rating was a 6 (but now is way lower). The game has nice art but it is very long due to the constant passing around of monk cards (which almost turns the asking a useless mechanic), the movement mechanics (only moving two spaces means that some turns you don't get anywhere or do anything), the mass every round and the stupid bell (which is an exercise of memory and not deduction). All of this turns this deduction game into a BIG waste of time. I liked the idea but this game need to be seriously streamlined. If you like deduction games, I recommend instead Black Vienna, which is a great game.

I refuse to play this again.

Great improvement on Clue.  Nice family game, with intellectual depth: in between the large number of traits, the scoring system, the transferring cards, and the changing turn order, there's a lot to think about. With the open-ended questions, the game almost becomes a game of bluff at a certain point.  Loved that my 8 year old could be competitive (and handicaps easily).   Main problem is the odd turn order and necessity for house rules for questions.

The first time I played this I wasn't sure I was going to like it. It felt like there was some logic/problem solving technique that I just wasn't getting. We've played it a couple more times since then, though, and it has definitely clicked. It's a lot of fun, and there are definite strategies for playing and deducing the culprit. One thing worth mentioning, though, is that the whole game can fall victim to one player's flawed logic. It's important, when asking questions, to distinguish between monks you've seen, and monks you've eliminated for other reasons.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

A fun game with a variety of different ways to solve the mystery. Creative questioning and bluffing makes this game far more interesting than Cluedo. The theme adds interest and variety to the proceedings, and when played with the right group of people makes this game very entertaining.

Now I got to play it. We only did it once, and even though its rather simple, there are a few confusing elements. I like the fact that the monks are having different characteristics, but they are of little help until the end of the game. And these questions you must ask... Perhaps we didn't understand them, becourse the basic question became "So, is father xxx one of your suspects?"...

This game can be so much fun to play.  There's always high suspense and tension in the game. However, After playing well over a dozen times I notice I can get totally screwed during the course of the game and not even come close to having a chance.  I do not like the Bibliotakea (misspelled) cards, I think they are unbalanced and some can give a single player an incredible advantage while completely taking away any advantage another player had.  There's also luck involved in what questions you ask.  Some players get lucky by asking about the right guy and know pretty early on who might be the killer.  Still fun though

Update: It was tough, but I traded this for another game.  This game became a paradox for me.  It was dripping with so much theme creating an almost unparalleled a atmosphere yet the luck fact can kill the game.  Player errors and mistakes are more prominent and accessible than you might first think.  Would certainly play again, but it no longer holds a place in my collection.

I think the artwork, card text and components do a very nice job in this game of creating the right environment that helps make the game a little better than it really is.  There is so much randomness that you cannot really classify this as a deduction game.  Or maybe I'm not smart enough, and you can, but it seems like you actually need to see cards to eliminate them.  I would definitely recommend using the "speed up" variant in the rules of moving up to 3 spaces per turn.  I hope that further play will show some possibilities for at least minor deduction, or long term replayability may be problematic.

Update: The length of the game really bothers me when considering the impossibility of deduction (because of the moving cards.  I would play if everyone else was enthusiastic about it, but for now I hope to avoid it.  Downgraded from 7 to 4.

Wonderful components and art for this game, but the questioning phase is slow and the gameplay is a tad random. Love the "chanting" event card, though. Note that there isn't much deduction in this game though. Its much too chaotic for that.

One of the weakest games in the DoW series IMO.

I absolutely loathed this game. The art is nice, and the theme is fairly strong - but I think about 90% of winning at Mystery of the Abbey is taking good notes, and if I really wanted to do that with my free time I could just go to grad school. I don't think it's much of an upgrade over Clue except that the names are a little less silly, there are far more variables, and there are some mechanics thrown in that keep the information less than perfect.

Acquired in 2004. Only played 2 games so far. Chaotic version of clue with beautiful components but I find that the chaos in this case detracts from the game and weakens it.

This game is fine if you're with people that can think fast and play fast, otherwise its a snail-fest and the first time I played, Jan '08 at Jenn's, I ended up winning not by powers of deduction necessarily but because there was only one person I had not seen a card for yet and managed to be lucky enough to get to the accusation place before everyone else.  So, I'm not sold on this game yet.

I liked it, but I played with the wrong group...which easily killed the experience.  I'm not too into deduction games but I typically like Faidutti designs.  It just didn't go so well, we all basically waited for the cards to be toss around (during mass) before any real action took place.

Similar to Clue, in that you have to discover which card is not in circulation, by asking questions of the other players.  High camp factor when you are forced to chant every thing you say for a whole round and the anticipation of making someone do penance for forgetting to move the bell before their turn, make this game funner.

Mystery of the Abbey is the game Clue aspired to be. Both titles are pretty similar, but Mystery adds a bunch of simple rules which not only make sense, thematically speaking, but also skyrocket the fun factor.

As in Clue, players investigate a murder. The main difference with it is, instead of making random guesses of "Who, where, what", players can narrow the search by asking more complex questions, such as how does he look, to what order he belongs and so on. Also, players can gain cards belonging to another players, which prevents the flow of play from stagnating.

What I liked the most is the scoring mechanism: players are awarded points not only for guessing who has committed the crime, but also by how much they have narrowed the search. The winner will be someone who has been playing consistently well throughout the whole game, not simply the one who pulls the trigger first.

This one is the perfect title for those who want to hook non gamers who like Clue, and will appeal as well to those who want a light, clever and fun deduction game.

Very pleasant game for non-gamers. Has excellent climate of medieval abbey with monks. Event cards also fit very well with events like monks death near the bridge.

On the other hand, mechanics is in my opinion poorly designed. Several actions are worth making while other are not. The game rules are not precise about the way of selecting monks not guilty, what can make a disturbance during the game. Judging who can be guilty depends mainly on the luck, not on player actions. 


This game is a climate, nothing more.

RATING: 7
Fantastic theme (I'm a big fan of Umberto Eco) and beautiful components make this an eye-popper right out of the box. Fortunately, game play is just as intriguing. Drawbacks found in the fact that this game isn't really "fun" in the zany, goofy sense - only in the tense, competitive and brain-challenging sense. This is fine for a certain mind-set, but not the sort of game you pull out if you just want to goof around. You have to frame your questions well and keep close attention to win - special card draws adds enough randomness and colour to prevent it from being completely stodgy, and the card passing at mass accelerates the pace of the game as time goes on.

...and everyone LOVES the little bell.

Game declines a bit with additional plays after headiness of theme and component quality wears off.

Yipee! Finaly played MotA. It was thick with atmosphere, but the hooting from the next table over proved a distraction. Come to think of it, the noise made it hard to hear the questioning properly.

We had played this at a gameday, and the wife really wanted the game.

Deduction game in the same vein as Clue. Revamped Clue, if you will. Its theme evokes the mystery novel by Umberto Eco. It could be titled as "The Name of the Rose: The Board Game."

RATING: 8
"Name of the Rose" the board game. Not sure why the rating on "Alibi" is so low yet the rating is high here--they're the same game mechanics! Ask open ended questions, hoping that everyone is playing honestly, then pass a certain number of cards. It adds a board and movement back in where Alibi elimated those. The plus are the side decks that add humor and variety but there are some game killing cards that give INCREDIBLY unfair advantage to some players. Overall, love it, but it's not the end all of mystery games, just a nice diversion from them.

Only an OK game. Mystery of the Abbey is not a deduction game - it's more like a card-handling game. I can see, that there are little problems: the game itself isn't very deep, but there are many little details you have to remember SO it'll be very hard to teach this game for the non-gamers. That's sad, because this game should be played with people who doesn't usually play games.

If you liked Clue as a kid, you will love this one. Clearly a step above almost every other deduction game in terms of components, quality of game play, and overall presentation. For me this is the quintessential deduction game, and I have yet to find anything that comes close to it. One of Days of Wonders first titles. It started them off on the right foot, if only they had stuck to that foot more.

I have always been a fan of deduction games and even rate the venerable classic Clue quite highly compared to most on this site.  People have complained that the card passing creates too much chaos and kills the deductive element in the game.  I would probably prefer a less chaotic game, but I also enjoy the game as is.  After one play, I found that there were some (admittedly rare) opportunities to ask questions which did not reveal information to other players and still were of benefit to the asker.  I also enjoyed the mechanism by which one can make revelations and accusations before one is certain of the facts based on probability alone.  The side mechanisms (crypt, scriptorium and bibliotheca cards, penance, returning to mass every round) added some tacitical decisions and enriched the theme.  As usual, DOW does an excellent job with the presentation.

After only one play: Early rounds are cumbersome as effective questioning is near impossible. The game has some nice features but seems a little long and drawn out. Having more experience in asking good questions will help in future.
2nd play: Let each player move three spaces and also start with two suspect cards. This freed up the early play a lot and also the total game time.

A game soaking in theme. Everyone I've played it with gets in the mood and has a good time. A lot of people don't like the fact that passing suspect cards around means that information gained through questions is useless, but I find that all it does is make information time-sensitive and require you to adapt your questions as the game progresses. Haven't played with the expansion yet.

'Do you have a fat Templaaar?'

Not sure about this one so far. Deduction games are probably my favourite type overall so I naturally enjoy that aspect, but something isn't grabbing me. Maybe it's the open ended questioning. It could be I just need to play a few more times, get into it. Even if it grows on me though I know for sure it's not as good as Mystery Express, the other DoW deduction game. On the plus side, the game looks great, as all DoW games do.

I really enjoy this "grown up" version of Clue.  However, I have a problem with the way that the game is scored.  I feel like there should be a larger point penalty for incorrect assertions.  Either that or eliminate assertions altogether and only have accusations.

Bought it as a gift for my S.O. (Mettefreja, who chose it ;-))

Great expansion on Clue! and great theme, with different ways of gaining points. Mobility on the board is too restricted, I think, but we have only played it with 3 players, so player to player interaction might change this dramatically. But for 3 players, the move 1,2 or 3 option sounds like a good idea!

There is something of an endgame rush to the abbot, to make accusations and revelations - Revelations are a good way to run up your score, I have grabbed victory from the player making the correct accusations on more than one occasion, by having made revelations underway

RATING: 7
Another classic Faidutti. A deduction game where the suspect cards keep changing hands ALL the time and everything is influenced by additional random events - total chaos. BUT this isn't a bad thing. Because of the clever design the game never gets boring, is very dynamic, quite short for a deduction game and most of all VERY climatic and fun - people tend to AUTOMATICALLY start acting as if they were some kind of monks. :-D Overall the suspect card-features seem to be very balanced and cleverly designed - the same is true for the seemingly chaotic features. In the end most experienced players will have found the murderer in about the same moment BUT that's where the wonderful "revelation" mechanic comes in - if you systematically reveal some of the features of the suspected murderer you'll win the game even if someone gets lucky and identifies the precise person before you.

Received for Citadels at UK Game Expo 2014. I really enjoyed my first couple of plays (will see how it fares) and an very glad we have it. Caution needs to be given to a system of marking suspects as seen and separating this from suspects you deduce are out there. It avoids confusion and people going astray because someone else got the wrong end of the stick. But it is a lot of fun and basically a way better version of Cluedo and Guess Who? combined. Excellent game.

Brilliantly evocative theme and exciting deduction make this game awesome.  The deck draws are also an impressive highlight, but they do not overshadow the principle aspects of the game; rather, they ensure that you really have no similar games.  The board is beautiful as well, with high class bits.  Great for mystery lovers, Cadfael fans, and Umberto Eco readers.

RATING: 8
A beautiful looking game with tons of idiosyncratic flavor ad lots of opportunities for goofy play-acting. Perfect for folks who like the bare idea of a deduction mechanic but want a bit more playfulness and variation than Clue or Mr. Jack have to offer. My only complaint is that the "ask another player" mechanic doesn't make very much sense, given how quickly cards circulate around the table, unless you take rigorous notes or have a phenomenal memory. This creates the possibility of a split amongst players between the 'casuals' who just want to pretend to be monks for a while, and the 'grinders' who'll be scribbling out spreadsheets between turns.

Beautiful game pieces, and interesting concept.  I always liked games of deduction like "Clue," however I found Mystery of the Abbey deductive mechanism to be confusing and not very satisfying.  Was much better replaying it with the right gaming group, and by using the vow of silence mechanism to bluff/confuse it's more fun, with better social interaction.  I believe it is less of a deduction game than a game of interaction and bluffing while trying to deduce, and a pretty good one at that.

Okay, people have told me this game is nothing like Clue, but to the four players I first played it with, that's the only comparison they made.  Granted, they said it was more fun and definately better looking than Clue, but still a solve-the-murder game.  There doesn't seem to be much point to the questions other than asking about specific suspects [i]("Have you got Father Bruno?")[/i], instead of characteristics like whether they're bearded or not.  

The mechanics are interesting, the board and pieces outstanding, and I can't wait till the next game.  A winner among my collection of games.

I can't help it, I like deduction games--it's all about developing a notation system that allows you to learn more than your opponents think they're revealing.  This game has great art and is very thematic, lots of nice details.  The extra abilities on certain cards you can collect shake things up a bit, and moving everyone back to the same room at the end of every fourth turn is a great way to sort of re-set the board.

The Name of the Rose by Umberto Eco is one my favorite books so this was destined to be a hit with me.

Clue is my favourite of the classic board games.  I loved travelling through the mansion trying to be the first one to get enough clues to figure out who killed Mr. Body.  Clue has some well known flaws though.  One was rolling a die to see how far you could walk around the mansion, especially if you kept rolling low.  Another, was magically getting teleported to a room across the board, if someone happened to accuse your character of the murder.  A third hassle was that one player's pawn could block other players' pawns from going by. 

Mystery of the Abbey takes the best of Clue and dumps the worst.  In it you are a Monk trying to figure out who murdered a another Monk.  You are not under suspicion, so no one will be teleporting you anywhere.  Also, on your turn, you may move one or two spaces, so no die rolling.  Also, two player's pawns can be in the same place at the same time.  This actually allows for questioning of other players.  Other than that, you go around the Abbey collecting clues.  Every room you enter allows you to do this in some special way.  You strike off potential suspects until you are ready to make an accusation.

Mystery of the Abbey is a really well made game.  The board beautifully depicts the inside of the Abbey.  The cards are high quality.  The pawns used by players are miniature Abbots.  Every detail is striking.  There's even a little working bell to summon Abbots back to the chapel.  If you like deduction, you must have Mystery of the Abbey!

This game doesn't know what it wants to be. Is it a deduction game? No, too many cards change hands too often to make deduction possible unless you get extremely lucky. The best way to ask questions of another player is to refer to a card passed between you since this is knowledge that only the two of you have. However, this is an extremely annoying way to ask questions and it doesn't seem to be in the spirit of the game. So is this a party, not to be taken so seriously? No, there are too many fidley gamers rules for that. It's true that this game is good for some laughs but, on balance, I don't like all the chaos in my serious games and I don't like all the rules in my party games.

This game makes me sad. I so wanted to like it more, it needs me to like it more. Its an amazing box of beautiful bits. Its a theme to appeal to any "Name of the Rose" and medieval recreationists soul. Its easy to get other people who've heard of clue to play it as an 'improved' version, but it just doesn't excite me. It was LONG. While there was a lot of player interaction, it wasn't exciting. I was even the winner, but it didn't feel like any great leap of deduction. It just felt like I was the first one to guess based off of taking the time to check off all other possibilities. Purchased at Days of Wonder Booth, GenCon 04.

a interesting take on a murder-mystery type of game.  better than clue for sure.

The one possible issue is if someone takes bad notes and cant answer questions correctly it will bog down and cause much frustration.

The production values on a Days of Wonder game are always good.  This is a game of deductive reasoning though it's not so difficult for just about anyone to pick up and enjoy.  Having players speak in plainchant or sing "Are you Sleeping" makes for a fun game.  I wouldn't play this game every weekend but it's nice to take down from the shelf once in a great while.

A little deeper than Cluedo, after my first play I realise that you have to keep better track of which cards you've had from whom. It works quite well, with some fun elements in the event deck, such as communicating in plainsong. I do wonder if the call to mass happens a little too often, especially given that confessional is just off the chapel, meaning players can fill their turns with other things and just wait for a call to Mass before skipping into confession and taking a card from another player.

A decent family game, I'm not sure all the mechanisms mesh together perfectly.

The beautiful board & pieces really add to the "Name of the rose" atmosfear of this "whodunnit". 

I've played this a couple times over the years, but never got really excited about it. It might have been because it probably needs a certain kind of players to make this fun. Just didn't happen that way the times I tried it with people.

Since it doesn't hit the table that much, and I haven't played it much the last 4 years it's on my tradelist now.

A lot of fun with the right people. Still a good game with more serious sleuthers. You have to be able to mitigate the card passing "chaos" with good notes and probability of card locations (ie, I passed this card to x last mass, y raided x for a card, and now y has 1 of the same type. Odds are it isn't the same card but ... how sure should I be?)

RATING: 7
Great components.  Great ideas.  A much deeper version of "Clue."  Your crew will make all the difference here.  Smart players will make for a smart and fun game.  (Isn't that always the case?)  More so here, because the heart of the game are the questions being asked around.  Use of the cards should be encouraged more.  Also using the 1-3 space move rule, instead of 1-2 spaces will accelerate the action.

This game takes the idea of clue and makes it more strategic and fun. You have a selection of monks belonging to different orders, holding different positions within a monastery, and each player holds a portion of the information, having different body types and other features. In a way it's like mixing in guess who with clue. Players may choose to ask one another questions as their pawns meet, search each other's quarters and make wagers on aspects of the character in hopes to earn points at the end of the game.

Probably my favourite deduction game at this point.

Combining elements of both Alibi and Clue, this game has such stellar bits that it&#039;s hard not to like it for those alone.

With the chaos somewhat controllable by designer-supplied variants, I find it hard to bitch overmuch about that aspect.

I really enjoy the feel of this game and the kids always like it.  However, seems like there might be a balance issue since, despite all the different types of actions (Crypt, Scriptorum cards, etc.), the quickest path to victory is to spend most of your time talking to as many other players as possible.  Then again, maybe I'm playing it wrong.

Wow, is this ever terrible! Fun as a social experience, but totally wasted as a deductive exercise. Clue and Tombouctou are much better deduction games, by a landslide. There are too many attributes, and the cards get passed around too much, to be able to ask worthwhile questions. You can only really start asking good questions in the last round or so when you've seen most of the cards available. Overall, this is a great idea, but a completely terrible execution. Sorry Bruno :(

Cluedo in a "Name of the Rose" setting.
Unlikely Cluedo, you have many strategies and tactics to win the game, bluffs included. The increasing number of cards you have to give to left-side player every turn make last turn a pandemonium where luck count more than deduction skill. But the setting is great, materials are high quality, the game is fun... and the murderer very often is revealed not too late.

Entertaining murder mystery, very social and a perfect game to play with people who don't play many games.

If you like Clue then you will enjoy Mystery of the Abbey. In this game, players are monks trying to solve the culprit of a murder that has taken place in the abbey. The abbey itself houses a number of various personalities with different traits and characteristics. Through asking questions and revealing cards, players try and deduce the missing clergy member, whose card is not in circulation.  

As typical with products from Days of Wonder, the components are top notch! The art and pieces are all very well made and the game even comes with a little bell to ting mass. The game play itself is quite simple and has players wandering the abbey asking other players questions or picking special cards. Although, not an intense deduction game, it does offer a little bit more strategy that a typical Clue game with rooms that allow you to do certain things and cards that have special actions. A light medium game that has a lot of player interaction.

I found this game to be very theme heavy and overall rather good.  Yes, I've seen it called "Clue on 'roids" or "Clue for Eurogeeks" or whatever, but it's a really good game wound up in there.  The secrets to this game are how you manage your cards and when to ask/not ask questions.

The game is as much about strategy as it is about deducing who the murderer is, and the cards in the decks attempt to defuse a lot of hoarding strategies.

(EDIT:  April 3, 2007):  The more I've played this, the more I've kicked myself for not playing it sooner.  This is one of those games that is really dependent upon whom you play with; with the right players who dig the theme, it's a blast.  This is one of those games that also benefit from being goofy and playing Gregorian Chant (I'm sure that you can probably dig up an old copy of Chant around somewhere) while the game is playing.  Really, the only things missing are Christian Slater and the girl from Name of the Rose.

Kudos to Bruno for designing another game that our gaming group likes a lot.  (Citadels is another.)

A game based tangentally on The Name of the Rose? Count me in! Beautifully produced and fun, although I'm sure players have a huge amount of influence on how much fun you will have.  Great entry-way game for most ages.

However, the open questioning bothers me, as does the understandable lack of a motive. Also, it seemed very easy in our first play to have players making Accusations and Revelations willy-nilly, though I suppose that might be a tactical choice. For a Clue-like game of deduction, however, this is pretty much the zenith.

One of the most beautiful games out there, it has great miniatures and the board is really beautiful.

A Days of Wonder title that sits in that 'nice idea but not well executed' category. 

Being a game of deduction that part of the game is really enjoyable as the players have a full Colour Suspects sheet to help them pose questions of other players to help eliminate who the murderer might be and hone in on the culprit. Each player holds a set of suspect cards so they respond to questions based on who they hold and the question asked. The murderer of course is the one suspect card not in play (held by the players). 

Different rooms offer different abilities as well. So where's the problem? Well the game uses a scoring system that in theory allows a player not guessing the murderer to win. But the scoring is fairly flawed and really spoils the whole experience.

I'm a big fan of "The Name of the Rose" as well, and this game really captures the theme well.  Racing across an abbey, interogating your fellow monks. Lots of interaction, extremely beautiful components, and very fun! Much more than "just" Clue in an Abbey as many people simply put it.

Often sold as a better Clue. Is actually worse. Basically Guess Who with gorgeous Clue components and half a billion Name of the Rose roleplaying rules. Unfortunately the swingy nature of questions (which might end the game abruptly and will always somehow benefit your opponents) and partial card passing each round makes winning really more tied to randomness than your ability at deducing or concealing information. The most fun you might have is probably being forced by an event card to speak a whole round in Gregorian chants; but you hardly need a game to devise such silly things. Really all fluff, no substance.

[b]Mystery of the Abbey[/b] by [person=125][/person] and Serge Laget

Deduction game a la Clue.

Played the game 1 time, played incorrectly... missed one very important rule, which totally ruined the experience. Have not played it since... 

Check out the game designer´s interesting blog, it is both in French and English:

A much improved version of the standard Clue. It's been a while since I played it but I remember enjoying it much more than a recent playing of Clue : Simpsons Edition

RATING: 3.5
I think there's too much back and forth card switching for good deduction opportunities and runs a bit long. I like the theme but some event cards like singing a song I rather dislike. Decent luck with the card draws too imo like scriptorium and such and the cover sheets are a bit flimsy and hard to notetake on.

Oh another thing is that as you announce suspicions, you give the others more info. That's good and bad but it makes some deductions pointless if you reduce something and others say the info somehow.

I had some hope for this deduction game as it was once popular. Well I should have known better. Coming from Bruno and Serge, there are too much going on to enjoy the deduction elements. Catilina's Conspiracy in New Game in Old Rome is so much faster and better.

Granted, this is only based on a single playing, but I can&#039;t understand what people like about this incredibly tedious game. There is no apparent skill involved in deducing the murderer, and it all becomes a pointless (and drawn out) race to see who can make revelations (based on little more knowledge than could be ascertained by the flip of a coin) the fastest and who gets lucky enough to see the most cards. I&#039;m hoping that there is something I&#039;m missing because I&#039;d hate to think that the majority of the people that have rated this game are completely insane, so please feel free to convince me. I just don&#039;t see that there are any useful questions to be asked that will help determine the identity of the murderer, other than &quot;Do you have X in your hand?&quot; To me this is an annoying Clue clone with a few more things to keep track of (and nowhere near as elegant of a way to keep track of things as Clue), large doses of unbalancing chaos, and mind-numbing length. Dreadful on every level.

Beautiful.  I wanted to like this game more than I did in my one play of it so far.  Luck factors seem to overwhelm the work you put into deducing things, making the questions somewhat pointless.  At the same time, some players were trying to somehow engineer their way into game-breaking questions, leaving us with a lot of issues about the validity of some questions.  Would like to play again to see if I'm missing something, but my current suspicion is that this game needs some tuning still.

Been thinking about this for a while as it is not a wargame. Finaly bought it and it is a great laugh - fun to play as long as you have a sense of humour and don't take it (or yourself) too seriously. Try keeping your face straight whilst you question other monks in Gregorian Plain Chant.

Has superseded in collection by Mystery Express, though neither is a great game.

RATING: 4
Mystery Of The Abbey is a more immersive experience than Clue, but as the goal of the game is to solve a murder, a lot of the events and masses feel like roadblocks. Also, the points system and characteristics of the monks feel like afterthoughts as, in most cases, by the time a player has narrowed down to a set of characteristics that player probably knows who the culprit is already.

The game seems to have a set strategy necessary to win:
Before the 3rd mass it seems the only goal is to steal as many cards as possible from other players. Before 5th mass it is most important to ask appropriate questions. If the game progresses past the 5th mass and you can't accuse the culprit, then at least make accurate revelations to score points.

Gameplay-wise it is crucial to keep track of where each of your cards comes from as it is in your best interest during mass to pass on cards that the player to your left already knows about.

Frankly, I was anticipating MotA replacing Clue, but it fell short. In MotA, if a player were to do absolutely nothing but attend Mass, by the 5th Mass he/she would have all the information to solve the murder. It is mandatory that information is passed around, so MotA is less about deduction, and more like a race. As more info is passed each Mass it feels like the game is taking pity on players for being slow and treats them like children.

Okay, maybe I'm being a little unfair here. I suppose the game has the potential to be enjoyable enough for a 7.

Saw the demo at WBC. Looks like a somewhat more complicated version of Clue. There are special ways to get information, and making an accusation doesn't drop someone out of the game, but correct answers earn VP's while wrong guesses lose them.

RATING: 7
Deduction game with some party game elements. A thematic for a euro game. It's not as analytical as most deduction games but I'd actually think this as a merit for the game. Scoring system makes you want to do some accusations even when you haven't got 100% info, which might not work if game was a more serious one deduction game. It's fun to play.

BÃ¡sicamente es el Cluedo, pero con mÃ¡s glamour. Me gusta su mecÃ¡nica, pero si los jugadores no saben hacer preguntas un poco certeras la partida se vuelve un ir tachando a los sospechosos que puedas, y eso le quita muchos enteros.

For trade: like new (minus some playing sheets of course.)  Played 3-4 times.

Take the game Clue, add in some great artwork and interesting thematic elements.

Then add in a bunch of game mechanics that seem like they could add some interesting gameplay elements, but in fact do nothing other than to make it impossible to rely on logic alone to "solve" the murder puzzle.

It does seem like the open-ended questioning of other players could really add a lot to the game experience.  But the cards float around so much that it is impossible to do any logic triangulation -- an important element of Clue.

Instead, you end up relying on what other players remember, or think they know about the murderer.  If they made a mistake in their calculations (or more likely, a bad assumption), and you use that information, you now have a big hole in your case.

Because all players hear the question and answer, the most difficult part of the game is actually phrasing the questions you need to ask in such a way that you are not actually providing more information to other players than you are getting.

There does seem to be some potential here, and perhaps there is a strategy I just don't get.  For me, I just find it frustrating and un-fun.

It is another variation on the "deduction" mechanism from [i]Sleuth[/i], but not as heavy and featuring more luck elements and some random outcomes. This makes for a light-medium game.
It has very nice components and a gorgeous board.

It has elements of a pure deduction game, but those are offset by some built-in chaos.  This has the effect of tipping the game's favor away from the best logicians, making it (in my opinion) a better game for most groups than many pure deduction games.  No dice rolling for movement is great, because it takes luck out of one's ability to go to the specific places one needs to to get things done.  More and more players definitely adds more and more chaos, but also more and more interaction.  However, the extreme increase in playing time with more players can be highly detrimental.

A wonderful game with its ancestory emanating from Clue! This game is intriguing, humorous, and a bit confusing...but in a good investigative way! There are so many monks that could have committed the crime! Some monks are balding, bearded, clean shaven, skinny, etc., these traits are what will help narrow down your search for the culprit! Ask your questions carefully and wisely and you might find out important information! Watch out that you take careful notes because everyone's hand of cards will be passed on little by little at the end of every round! Every game is surprisingly interesting and new with the help of the event deck!

Games can be long, lasting for a few hours! So, if you plan for it...you will have a good time! Every time we have played most everyone has laughed the whole way and enjoyed asking clever questions! It really gets everyone involved!

Bruno Faidutti adds chaos to Cluedo. There are 25 monks in the abbey. One of them did it. But who? The murderous monk card is spirited away, and the remaining 24 get dealt out or placed to one side for later pick up.

There are various places you can go around the abbey. The confessional allows you to steal a card from the player last there. The parlour allows you to ask for a card that meets characteristics you specify. The scriptorium gives you an action card. The biblioteque has some more powerful cards. The salon allows you to make revelations or an accusation. There's a cell for each player that allows you to steal a card from them. The crypt gets you an extra move marker to be used at some point in the game.

The action comes however mostly in the form of questions. Everytime you land on the same space as another player you can ask them a question. They can take a vow of silence, or choose to answer. If they answer, you must answer a question they have for you in return.

You can ask any type of question except one that expects a monk's name as an answer. You can ask the more direct question (do you have so-and-so in your hand, or have you eliminated so-and-so as a suspect) or be more general (how many white fat hooded monks have you eliminated as suspects) and so on. Each monk has one of each of the 5 characteristics which allow for all sorts of groupings:

1. Black, white or grey
2. Reverend Peres, Freres or Novices
3. Hooded or not
4. Fat or thin
5. Bearded or not

After 5 turns, mass is called and everyone passes cards to the left (1 for each mass that's been called so far). The longer the game goes, the more cards get passed around and the closer someone gets to making a correct accusation (worth 4 points). You can make revelations along the way (eg it's a fat monk) which each earn 2 points if correct. Incorrect accusations and revelations lose you points once the murderer is revealed. Winner is most points.

Progress is hindered as a lot of questions centre around 'who have you eliminated as suspects' because the cards get rotated too frequently to be of much use to ask questions about what each person has in their hand. The problem we had is that if players have erroneously eliminated monk's from their list, you end up with the situation that everyone has eliminated every monk from suspicion. ARGGGHHH. So we have some fragility. 

It's difficult to come up with questions that would be helpful to you, but not to everyone else at the board. It means that everyone more or less comes to the same page as to who the murderer was or could be around the same time.

In the end, too much downtime and end-game chaos to be satisfying.

Like a more advanced Clue where you have to also do odd things and not get caught in other players areas. You also whisper things to others and can chose to answer or not, since if you answer you can also ask a question. The regular rules say questions are asked out loud, yet I find this dull since no one gets a real edge on anyone else. Most games are won on an aducated guess, which anyone can make. Overall, not the greatest game.

Dietro a un'ottima veste grafica si celano meccaniche investigative "tradizionali", che non aggiungono niente ma funzionano. Si arriva al colpevole escludendo i monaci come in Indovina Chi, spostandosi di stanza in stanza come in Cluedo. Il rischio (che abbiamo provato sulla nostra pelle) è che se un giocatore sbaglia a dare una risposta il castello di deduzioni va a farsi friggere e il gioco è rovinato. Tengo basso il voto, ma il gioco merita una prova d'appello.

One of the sides of the box is split and it has some compression damage. Then contents are in good shape. The cards have been played and a couple of the mystery sheets are used, but overall I would rate the contents as good.
The insert shows some damage on one corner where it looks like it was dropped (also there some very slight damage to the board I only found after looking at the insert, it's very minor and I only mention it in the interest of being thorough).
The free expansion isn't included (I haven't gotten around to ordering it yet).

Has some interesting deduction involved, but it starts off incredibly slow and most rooms aren't interesting. Felt a bit too lucky and apparently someone screwed up somewhere because we all had rather differing answers to who it was.  Deductive games really aren't my thing anyways. 

I'm really not a fan of passing the cards around. You tend to lose track of information quite quickly that way.

Update: Yep, still absolutely hate this "game". It's far too random with the passing of cards and asking questions is confusing the way it's structured. On top of that, the skip a turn mechanism is down right retarded. How this game gets recommended is beyond me.

This is a good Clue-killer.  The strategy and movement is more fair and tougher to perform.  There are a lot of good decisions what to do in limited time.  I like all of the combinations of the monks, making it a deeper game.  Another good point is awarding points for correct revelations, so the accuser may not be the winner if someone else did all of the previous legwork.

I don't like the "passing the suspect cards" each round.  Granted, it does speed up the game, however turns it more into luck.  

Some people really dislike the chanting card, however toss it if it's an issue.

RATING: 1.5
Absolutely abominable. Some turns you do absolutely nothing. Some turns you ask other players structureless questions that they can FREELY REFUSE TO ANSWER WITH NO PENALTIES WHATSOEVER. If you forget a rule you miss your turn? Yep! You go back to start every four turns, and most locations you can go to are three turns away. The questions you ask people can be mistaken, which can cause EVERYONE to name the wrong culprit. Takes a ludicrous amount of time for what essentially amounts to an unstructured game of Guess Who where nobody knows anything. And let's not forget the periodic enforced fun, like making everyone chant for four turns lest they miss their turn. This is the kind of lazy, unplayable garbage that makes me want to quit board gaming.

The first time we played this game; I won in a half hour.  I dismissed it as too easy.  We recently revisited it with six players and found it to be a bit more challenging.

Days of Wonder strikes again with an updated version of an older game, bringing their incredible production values to the board and game pieces, which include brightly colored plastic figures and an actual metal bell.  Gameplay is a more intellectual version of Clue, but we haven't yet found a way to avoid a late game rush to reveal the murderer; a situation where all (or most) of the players know his identity and the person closest to the revelation room will win.

It does, [i]however[/i] work fairly nice on three players with the right kind of people and some small tweeks to the rules. This is my favourite [b]deduction[/b]game and it has a really thick theme.

Clue on steroids in a Name of the Rose milieu. Fun but taxing. DoW once again has produced a wonderfully looking game.

After several plays I've become less and less enamoured by this one. Too fluffy and chaotic.

There's a lot of game here, but I can't get my group to get the most out of it.  See my session report for details...

Having picked it up again after a long layoff, I think this game is not so much a game so much as a psychological test of patience.  It may proceed too slowly (and what progress is made seems to be due in part to some luck).  Strategic play only seems to last so long before the questions just get more and more careless.

RATING: 6
The game is so easily broken (my first play resulted in this!) whenever any single player assumes that he/she has seen a suspect, when in fact he/she has not. Result: bad accusations based upon honest mistakes. Horrible ending as a result. The game was also surprisingly slow to progress to something other than "have you seen so and so", and no event cards were drawn that helped to make the theme more fun. Sorely disappointed in my first play.

Great deduction game, but ppl that play it for the first time tend to lie all the time on questions asked during the game, even though this is forbidden by the rules.

Like Cluedo, but set in a medieval abbey. More suspects (all the monks who live there, over 20 of them), but easier to sort through them, in a method not unlike Guess Who, with suspects eliminated based on size, hairyness, rank and order. Good fun, and also has a little bell to ring in Mass, but takes a while to play.

Played once, didn't quite get a feel for the best strategy, seems like the questions you can ask are either too vague to be helpful, or too specific which will not be answered or give the information to everyone.

RATING: 7
I appreciate and enjoy that the designers have addressed the issues with "Cluedo": the frustrating die movement, the ponderous, repetitive clue collecting and the main flaw- player elimination. So in the Abbey you now move 1-2 spaces, questioning is delightfully freeform and gradually clue cards are passed to the left to speed up the facts of the case; and in your summing up, if you are wrong, the suspect card held is shown and you are penalised with pts subtracted from your score. It's nice that this scoring system keeps players in the game, though lacks the elegance of the race to be "first" to solve the missing card(s). I was hopeful the quick play would usurp Cluedo, but the logical train of thought enjoyed in the old classic is given a shaky ride with all the event cards and special effects as well as the card passing. This chaos doesn't sit well with some though I was beginning to warm to it. You could dispense with the cards but it's a shame to throw out over half the deck of cards.

Clue on steroids... the scriptorium and biblioteca cards add a nice element to a familiar theme.

RATING: 6
The idea here is that one person card is the murderer. Players get a number of cards to their hand and a checklist on paper. Through the game, you can ask other players questions about what they've seen or what they think (although they don't have to answer you), and then you get winning points if you can run to the right room and guess right first. There are also action cards you can get that either have strong effects, or no significant effect depending on your flip luck. What I didn't like about the game is the amount of information you need to keep in order to do well. You need to know who said what when, who you think has seen what cards, which cards can you hand to an opponent without giving them new information... it's all too complicated for what ultimately works out to be a coin flip between two or three end candidates. I think this game is fine if you are passionate about deduction games, but it didn't really work for me.

Pretty game. Played once. Six players. Way too long and way too random.  Just waitng to see what monks are either seen or definitely excluded by direct Q&A. Too many monks, too much spread in card effects, and too much time posing 'deductive' questions that in the end are rendered moot by all the card swapping. I 'won' by making an all-or-none 'semi-guess' just to get it over with.  I like Clue better and I don't much like Clue at all.  Won't play again.

Only played it once so far, but seems like a terrible version of Clue.  We had 3 players to give it a run through, and the game was over in the second turn, just had to wait for the character stack to run out before I could make an accusation.  Immediately some rule modifications and required players were changed.  Requires 5.  No direct questions asking if someone has such and such a card.

To me, the best thing about this game is the theme. I adore the Name of the Rose and this is probalaby as close as you can get to playing a mystery game set in an abbey (apart from the game The Name of the Rose itself of course). But I still think it is only medicore and although it is refreshingly different from your average Euro game (not much different from Cluedo though), there is not enough to it too make it deeply engaging for me. Yes, the way you ask questions and take notes makes a big difference but it is not something I derive joy from while playing. The event cards are interesting and prevent the game from becoming stale, especially with multiple plays. I will have to play it a few more times to see where the rating might go.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

I love this game! It's like Clue meets Guess Who meets a bluffing game. Plus, the way that time works, it never feels like you get to do everything you want to, which really increases its replay value in my opinion. This one has not gotten old for me, even though I've owned it for several years.

RATING: 1
I hate this game. This should have been themed to take place in a high school, and the object was to discover who made out with whom.

This game is *not* a deduction game. It's a game of intution. If you think you're right, then you should guess as fast as possible. Now the game becomes a race to see who could manipulate the event cards (of which some of them are way too powerful) to guess first.

The game is really slow. Players take way too much time to formulate questions. After a certain point in the game, the questioning becomes useless, but the rules insist that you have to keep on asking them. If you're not pretending to be Wilma, Fred, or Daffney, then this game becomese pure torture.

RATING: 8
Mystery of the Abbey is the single most cool, atmospheric game that I have played to date.  It requires intelligence to ask questions in a manner that helps you but does not help everyone else.  I don't think our group has wrung the full potential out of the game.  The board, components and art are top notch and the game has a great story arc.  If there is a critique, it would be that people who are not careful with showing others what card they have when they are supposed to, can cause the entire game to break down.  I would suggest that everyone use a coding system that differentiates the cards the player has actually seen from the cards the player deduces through clues.

This was surprisingly unimpressive to me.  I like Clue and the ilk, and the theme, but the mechanics and gameplay of this was simply unexciting, uninteresting, and more frustrating than it should have been.
My extra-low rating is because I feel the extra complexity it layers on the Clue deduction mechanics does not lead to a better game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very neat game. My game group did not enjoy having the game interrupted every so often by the bell ringing and suspect cards being shuffled. I personally thought that it kept things interesting, but I was also having quite a hard time.

My problem was that I could not figure out how to make the most out of the questions people would ask each other, which resulted in me only crossing out suspects after I had asked a question =o

If you're good at deduction, you should certainly enjoy this game, but you might be annoyed when the suspect cards in your hand have to be exchanged every so often.

Rated a 6.5 after first play.  I enjoyed it, but found the record keeping sheets to be lacking.  I need more space to make notes, etc.  At first I was floundering trying to concoct useful questions to ask.  By the end of the game, however, I was starting to get the hang of it.  I am looking forward to playing it a few more times over the next few weeks to see if it grows on me as I "learn the game" a bit more. 

8/24/11 Have played this a couple more times since I wrote my first thoughts.  While a nice, solid game - it hasn't grabbed me in the way I hoped it would.  Also, the game is very dependent on people answering your questions correctly.  If someone accidently gives you bad info, it can screw the entire session.

I almost really like this game - it has silliness, theme and deduction.  But it is not silly enough for the level of chaos: there either needs to be more handing out of penance and ceremonial processing around the table, or the random card-pulling needs to be mitigated.  Might be OK with 3 players.  Vulnerable to problems with misinterpreted questions: "have you eliminated X?" might mean to some that "X"has been sighted, whereas to others a reasonable chain of logic is OK.

Fun game.  But it's a little too random.  It needs a slight rule tweak to make it perfect.  But the theme and the mechanics are great.

Great game of deduction!  Works well with any non-gamers I've played with.  It looks a little complex at first glance, but the rules are really easy to grasp, but the depth of strategy and question asking will keep any skill level's attention.  Great theme and high quality parts.  I never liked "clue," but loved "guess who" growing up and this game mixes some of them together to make a great game! Highly recomended for 5-6 players!

The game has some potential but, there is a lack of need for deduction compared to Clue. So, the game offers more possibility than Clue but, since you have to give cards to other players, you just wait to have seen more cards before beginning to deduce the culprit. In Clue, you don't have the choice to make some deductions which makes it a better deduction game in my opinion.

Quite the typical middle of the road DOW family game, not expecting much is the key, as always. It seems that ear-dropping is the best way to recoup info, so avoiding locations with others is a must - if you are forced to ask a question, just make it so unspecific that nobody can benefit from the answer. Capitalise on other players not understanding that and you should do well...

Fun, but might need a little tinkering.  It's a bit too long for my tastes, considering how chaotic it is!  Just when you start to make progress in figuring things out, there's a sudden lurch in the process and 50% of what you learned becomes useless.  If you can live with that frustration, it's not a bad game.

We couldn't finish our first game because some incorrect info was dispersed resulting in a couple players eliminating all monks as suspects. Players have to make sure they are taking accurrate notes and carefully providing correct information.

No one had figured out how to effectively question other players by the end of the game. There are definately some different strategies you can play with, but I'd need to play more to discover them.

I had a lot of fun with this game, even though we couldn't finish the first play and I couldn't figure out how to question effectively. I'm looking forward to more plays.

--Sept2004-- Delightful theme.  Mechanics work best with people on the same wavelength:  it's a bit frustrating to ask "How many monks (of the same order as the last card I passed you) have you actually seen?" only to discover that the other person doesn't keep track of those details.
--Jan2017-- And sold. I'm a bit sad - because I love the conceit of the game.  And, yet, I didn't much like playing it.  Guess I'm happy it's moved on.

This is a game that seems interesting at first, but turns out to be no more than glorified Clue -- the questions asked are the same one or two, 95% of the time. Also, this game can easily be derailed by one player making one incorrect deduction.  I'd rather play something else.

This is Clue on steroids.  It requires figuring out whodunit from a larger number of characters than clue, by asking intelligent questions from the other players.  I especially like a couple of the event cards, like having to speak in chants or singing "Are you Sleeping" in a round.  This game is good clean fun.

RATING: 4
An aesthetically pleasing, but ultimately unsatisfying game.  Really a crafty repackagin of Cluedo.  Definitely not so much a deduction game as a race that seems like a deduction game.  Top-quality components, creative design and whimsical illustration make it pretty to look at.  Probably great for younger players just learning how to play boardgames.  Or for parties or the inebriated I guess.  I'm dumbounded by the runaway success of this game.  The first game was a bit frustrating, as we hadn't realized that some of the criteria we should have been asking each other about were more elusive--a fact which didn't "enhance" our experience so much as make us feel this was an unfair slant on the game that would definitely and unfairly favor players who had gone through this one before.

Such a fun deduction game. My biggest complaint is that the rules on question asking aren't more specific. This game can get whacky, but when it does it doesn't get less fun, just less satisfying.

RATING: 4
Clue isn't a terrible game, but this is much better. The game is very human, with lots of interaction. It also is surprisingly thematic for such a simple game. The downside of so much interaction is that the game can be a little fragile, if someone accidentally answers a question incorrectly. Still, it's a fun game and is definitely worth a look.

*edit* It's not a little fragile. It's VERY fragile. One mistake by one player, and the whole game just collapses like a house of cards.

Mystery game based on clue mechanic.  Think Clue for gamers.  Pleasant game.  Uses a conceit seen in several Days of Wonder games (particularly Shadows over Camelot) where the communication around the table is player limited but open ended.  Works better in this game than Shadows OC.  There are some interesting logic and language possibilities in questioning your oppenent to solve the crime.  A nice game for non-gamers as the mechanics from Clue will be grasped quickly.

This is a deductive reasoning game wherein you move about the board asking people specific questions about suspects.  Someone is a murderer, and everyone has a list of innocent people.  By asking questions (i.e. "how many bearded monks do you know to be innocent") you deduce who must have committed the murder.  It's a mix of having to move about the board in order to ask questions or peak at people's cards, as well as get to a certain location to make an accusation, all with a timer that rests your location.  You need movement strategy and deductive reasoning to win this game.

A murder has been committed in a pleasent abbey and you must solve it. This game, inspired by [i]The Name of the Rose[/i], feels like [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1294]Clue[/url][/i] upgraded, but it is definitively more chaotic.  The special effects of the cards and the constant exchanges of them may provoke that players lose the track of the game.  I've played this game a couple of times, with a much different feeling.  Definitively, the game group's behaviour is very important to enjoy this game at its best.

High production values, and everything about the game is done well. This has gone over well with the family. I have yet to figure out the best way to ask questions so that I'm only helping myself--and I have no desire to read strategy articles about it. I don't mind the chaos, since it's meant to be lighter fare. There should be quite a bit of replay here, as we hardly went through any cards the first few times we played.

Cute game, nice components. Not exactly steeped with atmosphere but throw some Gregorian chanting music and wear blanket-robes and you're all set. I like games of deduction, but this one is tricky. It's difficult to ask players correlating questions because in between the askings their hand contents might change. That makes deduction very hard to do, so don't pick this game up if you want a real logic game. However, if you're willing to take a lighter look at sleuthing, this one is cute enough.

As a general rule, deduction games are hit or miss with me.  For myself, I really like them.  Unfortunately, many are very much susceptible to player error, which can ruin a game.  That my first game of this was marred by just such an incident and I still enjoyed it enough to get my own copy is a testament to how enjoyable I found this game.  Granted, it is not perfect.  If you end up with few (or no) cards as I did for a while, the game can be pretty uninteresting.  Still, early in the game, there is some excellent opportunity for deduction.  However, if deduction is poor, the design of the game pushes players to a point where they almost cannot avoid solving the puzzle.  It seems the tipping point between these two periods of the game is just about right.  Now if only you could avoid player error.  [02/17/2008]

[1 play] This is one of the lighter offerings from Days of Wonder, like Pirate's Cove. Mystery of the Abbey has less luck than Pirate's Cove, but they are both fairly light on strategy. The theme is rich, the components are truly awesome, and this game is quite enjoyable as a social experience with a fun group.

After only 1 play, I am wondering if we have discovered all of the clever ways to ask questions which reveal very little to the person being questioned and nothing at all to the other players. I am also unsure if this game has any strategical depth at all.

Most recent play 7-3-05 with Barb, Mindy, Dave, and Garrett at Net Lake.

RATING: 6.75
A fairly enjoyable twist on Clue(do). Yes, it has been describe as Clue on steroids. I think it's more like Clue on speed.

There are 24 suspects with a variety of attributes (physical, rank and order) and players have fixed movements each turn. The twist comes with the interaction with the board and players. There are special rooms that allow cards to give a bonus move, take cards from another player, etc. If one ends movement in a room with another player, they can both ask each other a free form question.

The frustrating element comes about with suspect cards being passed around each round. However, if one takes it as a light fun game and not try to record-keep to the minutest of details, it should be a good romp. Unfortunately, seasoned gamers are not likely to play it as such.

Production quality is excellent. The board and cards are a marvel to behold and adds much joy to the experience.

Clue was one of my favorite games as a kid and I must say this game looks to be mana from heaven.  One of the thrills of &quot;advanced&quot; Clue play (stop snickering) is that it is usually advantageous to make an accusation before you are completely sure of it (in order to prevent someone else from winning before your next turn).  Mystery of the Abbey let&#039;s you do this throughout the game and really forces educated/intuitive guesses on all the players.  Also, it is not trivial that the theme and followthrough are so evocative.

I really like the logic puzzle aspect to this game! The game is also gorgeously produced. My only gripe is that, after playing many times, the kinds of questions one can ask that help one's self while not aiding others are kind of limited. But this has been a great gateway game in our household. And hilarity ensues when people are *certain* they know who the killer is, and they screw up!

Those who claim this is merely a game of elimination, and not a true deduction game, do not understand how to ask the right questions. I guess, if I were playing in a group where someone asked a question like "Have you eliminated Brother so-and-so?" every turn, I would go nuts and probably despise this game. The trick is to ask questions which aid you more than they aid other players. One can also intentionally ask misleading questions, e.g. "Have you eliminated one or more of the thin Fathers?" when you have not eliminated *any* thin Fathers. (This question would lead many players to conclude that you [the asker] had already eliminated two thin Fathers - thus fouling up the deduction of your competitors.) Also fun: if you truthfully answer another player's question, he is bound to answer yours, even if it's an embarassing question not related to the game! This kind of thing helps make Mystery of the Abbey shine as a social game. So put on the Gregorian chanting, and enjoy. [Wife's #4 game and favorite social game.]

It is a lot better than Clue.  For the length of the game though I wouldn't easily find myself going back to this.  I also feel that there is a bit too much randomness for me to enjoy this as a deduction game.  

This stems from character cards getting passed around.  This eliminates you from using future questions to build on previous questions since their hand has changed.  Usually by the end of the game the information is fairly uniform among everyone, where they are trying to determine who it is among a several final choices.  The problem is either you ask a question that once again gives everyone the same information, you get lucky with a special card you got, or you get lucky and draw it from their hand.

If you have been thinking about getting this game but were afraid it was too much like Clue.  Worry not, you can safely shell out the dough.  This game is better in every aspect to the dusty deduction classic as you win or lose based on decisions you make.  Sure, there is a lot of luck, but not enough that you don't feel like you have any control.  The game is rich in color and creates a wonderful mood, I think this is one of the best deduction game made, certainly the best deduction game for wine. I find that the later it gets the more time everyone spends in penance.

This one gets top marks for great components, simple but effective rules, and a wonderfully integrated, rich theme. But as others have noted, the play itself is chaotic, with the regular exchange of cards making it difficult to frame good questions or deduce useful information from the replies. The more players, the greater the chaos, and it's possible to win by staying away from the Q&A altogether and simply trying to see as many cards as possible. It's fun once in a while, but not the kind of game you want to play every week so you can get better at it.

I have a lot of fun playing this game. I think if I thought about it too much I could start picking it apart and seeing flaws but I don't see the point in doing that when I'm having fun playing it. I've been able to get "non-gamers" to play this simply by comparing it to Clue. Everyone that I've introduced it to has enjoyed it so far. I've played it with different numbers of people now and I think I like it better with 4 players best.

One of my favorite new additions. Clue on steroids. The theme is perfect setting for a murder mystery. The components of this game are bar none some of the best I have seen. The rules are fairly simple, but there is a lot of depth to the game. Days of Wonder is one of my favorite companies already!

RATING: 7
I've heard this described as "Clue in Latin on crack" and that's close enough to the truth. You've got to play with people who can get into the theme, though, or it's going to fall kind of flat.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Clue on Crack. (Note, that's crack, not steroids, as Mystery of the Abbey is more chaotic, and not necessarily more deductive.) As cards frequently change hands, it's hard to put two pieces of information gathered at different times together confidently. The trick is devising questions for which the answers give you information without helping other people... and doing it before enough cards pass around the table that the answer is obvious to everyone.

Clue on steriods.  This is a fun deduction game with some decent player interaction, although there is a bit of downtime between turns, especially with a large number of players (I played with 5).  It does have a problem that people need to be good about keeping track of the information that they collect, but most deduction games have that problem, too.  Overall, a decent game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Lots of fun and very social.  Not too difficult (strategically) for a 7 year old, although some assistance with text will be required.  Can be a bit long, maybe because the endgame leaves something to be desired.  (After you've figured out whodunit, it can take you a number of moves to maneuver your pawn to the place where you need to be to make the announcement.) 

Haven't played it with the Pilgrim's Chronicle expansion yet, but looking forward to trying that.

RATING: 6
Another great-looking game from DoW! I think it's a good deduction games. However, I just tend not to like those games very much! I've only played it twice, and the second time was ruined by a newbie asking each of the other 3 players "have you crossed off Monk X?". Everyone answered "no", meaning Monk X was the murderer (or the newbie was very cleverly bluffing; highly unlikely). The game became a race to the Abbey master!
I would like to play more - we have not really used the revelations to gain points in either game, and it seems that may be quite important.

I heard such good things about it that I bought it as a graduation gift for a friend.  After we played it as a group, I was disappointed in several things:  the movement aspect, the length, and even the deduction element itself.  I love good deduction games such as Sleuth (well, Sleuth is great), but this one is tedious, relying far too much on moving around and hoping to get lucky.  That sounds too much like Clue, which I actually like better. At least my friend liked it!  Would make my list of most overrated games if I ever made one.

This is a strange game. Similar to Cluedo, but with mechanisms that really mess up your ability to deduce with certainty whodunnit. Then as time goes on, bigger and bigger hints, and rotation of hands... when I twigged this, I wish I'd not put so much effort in to track things at the start!

RATING: 7.5
This is what I refer to as "Grown Up Clue".  The game has a lot of great mechanics in it and the deduction is really fun.  I like how the person who guesses the murderer correctly is not necessarily the winner.  the one down side (which is no fault of the gae design) is how it can be derailed by a person who gives bad information.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Lots of fun for gamers and non-gamers. My wife and I taught this to another couple and the four of us had a blast coming up with interesting questions. The trick is to try and find a question that tells you something, but doesn't give the other players information.

Depending on the players, this can be a blast or a dud. More players does seem to help.

Sure, I know the deduction aspect in this game is much less well implemented than in, say, Sleuth. But whereas Sleuth always give me the feeling that I'm filling in a spreadsheet and try to design a clever way of making deductions from it, Mystery of the Abbey actually makes me feel I'm playing a game with other peaople. Pretty bits, some goofy cards and good theming. This is the kind of game I can play without problems with my parents or other non-gamers. Just don't take it too seriously as a deduction puzzle.

RATING: 6.5
It is no secret that "Mystery of the Abbey" is the game of "Clue" with a significant makeover.  Bruno and Serge have come up with a fun new theme, and of course Days of Wonder has done a bang-up job with the visuals, right down to the little bell.  Keep in mind, though, that it is quite an open-ended game and much is left up to the players' clever questioning of each other, so it might take at least one play-through to get the hang of it.  Also, do yourself a favour and have a box beside each suspect that each player can only check off when they have PHYSICALLY SEEN that suspect's card.  And that is this game's only real downfall - it can be quickly ruined by a player who mistakenly provides the wrong answer to a question (it wasn't me - honestly!).  After my second play, my opinion of this game went up, and then after a couple more plays it went back down again as I realized that it just doesn't seem quite as fun as it should be (but I can't put my finger on exactly what it missing).  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 2.5/5  Total: 6.5/10

I love deduction games so I was looking forward to this one. The whole Name of the Rose atmosphere is very appealing as a theme, and the art is great. However, you cannot truly do any deduction in this game because of the passing around of the cards. Maybe I just don't get it. The group of people I played with had a ton of fun though (especially when someone forgot to ring the bell) which is more than I can say for lots of similar games. I'd be willing to play again another time if someone could convince me there is actually a viable strategy.

RATING: 6
[DoW 03 edition] {Religion; deduction, utility cards} MotA is a party deduction game: an interesting combo. It's unique in a way that a player can guess an attribute of the murderer, instead of the specific murderer. MotA is full of player interaction. It is thematic with beautiful components. However, it's just an average deduction game because the cards are passing around and it becomes easier to guess the murderer. Players have to manage hand well so that useful information would not be leaked. (Therefore, the game won't run as long as Sleuth.) Although there is rich information to guess the murderer, it still needs good deduction skill to figure out the murderer.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Rating based on one play with non-gamers. I really wanted to love this game due to the Name of the Rose monastic setting and my childhood fondness for Clue. The theme is very well integrated with plenty of ways to invoke the atmosphere (the bell, clever card text, etc.). However, for a deduction game there is way too much randomness and chaos. I've come to the conclusion that Faidutti is not the designer for me.

RATING: 7
An incredibly pleasant deduction game that requires more actual thought than, say, Clue.  There are lots of interesting twists on the genre here--the frequent masses that require players to pass cards, in order to keep information flowing, the rules for asking and answering questions, the special library/scriptorium cards and mass-events--that keep the game feeling fresh.  

And let's be blunt here: the penance system makes the game.  When you tack on some extra rules for penance--not taking your turn in good time/not realizing it's your turn, swearing, answering ANY question falsely--it becomes a silly and fun party game in addition to a bit of a brain-burner.  I suck at this game, no bones about it, but I still enjoy it and appreciate that it's possible to win without even guessing the correct suspect first, if you've made some smart revelations throughout the game.  I wouldn't want to play it with less than 4 to 6, but it's a really nice medium group game that provokes a lot of laughs with the penance rules in effect.

My group's feelings about this game are quite mixed up. Some are fans, others do not want to play at all.
In my opinion, Mystery of the Abbey is the right mix between a pure deduction game (like Sleuth) and a more fun-oriented game. I especially like the mechanism, that the number of cards given to your left neighbour increases each round, so that even groups with less "deductional intelligence" are able to finish the game at some point.
Because of the excellent graphical presentation, the games are always a joy to me, though.

Mystery of the Abbey immediately draws people in whenever I show it, and the challenge of crafting a good question always keeps people thinking.  The first stage is finding a question that won't tell the whole table something when answered.  The second is making sure that if your opponent asks the same question in return, that the table won't know everything if you give your answer.  The ending can be a bit random, but this game, along with use of consecreated wine, and perhaps the card that requires chanting, is almost always fun.

I must say that I really enjoyed this game.  This rating comes after only one play, but I was quite impressed.  The start off with, the game components are very nice. As a whole, the game runs like an advanced form of Clue. But I felt the game-play leads to much more interaction between players.  This was especially true in my case as the other players in my session really got into the role-playing aspect of the medieval abbey.  Add to this the slightly random effect of the event cards (in a good way – makes the game interesting) and this made for one entertaining and fun game.

Not fun at all. The one time I played, it dragged forever. One guy refused to answer any questions the whole time, which made it very difficult for anybody to make progress. Finally, I made a wild guess and was correct and thankfully the game ended. Traded immediately.

RATING: 5
The empty rooms of the Abbey (and there are many) seem designed just to slow player's movements and stretch the game to a meaningful length.  That is annoying.  But the game suits a sociable crowd and that can be very valuable in small party situations.  As far as actual deduction goes, there isn't very much.  This is more of a game of hand management and wild revelations.

Recieved in UK Games Expo 2014 mathstrade for Citadels

After one play this seems like a lot of fun. I just wish I was any good at deducing things. 

Edit: After more plays this has become even more fun. I am still no good at deduction but finally managed to win a game on my 7th play. The question element is really interesting. The events make every game a little bit different so that helps. 

We have now laminated our suspect sheets and use dry wipe markers for making notes. Looks like it is a keeper!

Score: from 7 - 8.5

Great fun!  One of the few party games I truly enjoy.  Enough social gaming to make party gamers happy, just enough deduction to keep me happy and interested, and enough chaos to keep the outcome in doubt.

RATING: 6.5
A mystery/deduction game that's kind of a mash-up of "Guess Who" and "Clue", this game is pretty fun.  Some of the "player activity" cards are pretty cheesy (requiring players to chant like monks...really?) but overall this is a pretty fun game that I'd prefer to play over Clue any day.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
First play was interesting. We had NO IDEA what questions to ask each other. They didn't seem to help us much. I guess we were just doing it wrong. But what an interesting mechanic? And then with all the card passing, there's really no deduction to be done here. I guess it's a fun social game, but very odd. Not what I expected, which isn't necessarily bad.

Definitely a step up from Clue, but just seems broken in areas to me. One mistake during questioning and answering and the entire game can become a mess...

RATING: 8.9
I have enjoyed each playing of this game.  This is one of those games where the players excitedly talk about it as soon as it's done and tell others what they knew and when.  The best memory is when I drew the event that forced players to only speak in sing-song chant for an entire game round.  We were playing in a game store, and someone came over to ask us about the game.  Needless to say, our singing wasn't a strong selling point for him. I think he never returned to the store.

A pretty good take on Clue but really that's all it boils down to.  I like the new elements somewhat but has to be played with the right group or it will ruin the game.  Don't own, won't buy and will play only on rare occasions.  

UPDATE: I've been told of the "S Rule Variant" and would like to give this a try again with that in play. Seems like that would in fact help out quite a bit with the problems this game is plagued with.

Gorgeous game. Great theme. Singing cards are fun. Is this game won by superior deduction, or drawing the right cards? Sometimes it's the latter, but othewise a really good game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
It seemed like it would be a deeper, more involved game of Clue.  Perhaps, but if that is the case, then it's too deep.  There are multiple factors to keep in mind about the suspects.  That's not so bad, but then you have to combine it with the fact that suspect cards move from hand to hand, so you're never really sure if the information you get from one player this turn was the same information you got from a different player last turn.

The more I play this game, the more I enjoy it.  At the beginning we always take time to reiterate the importance of distinguishing between crossing off a monk we've seen, and crossing off a monk we think is out there.

This is a much more involved and interesting version of Clue.  I like the theme a lot, and it comes out pretty strongly in this game.  Asking the right questions at the right time are the key to succeeding in this game, so there is more than just luck involved.  I have had a bad experience with this game where someone must have marked off a monk accidentally and we couldn't finish the game because we had every person crossed off.  So if people aren't careful, this game could break.  I recommend playing by the fast rules included in the instructions.

Good game, certainly better than Clue. However, this is not a deduction game...but a race to rule out most suspects. Hence, I cannot give it a higher than 7 rating. Still, fun on occasions

Man, this game keeps on dropping down. Based on more plays, I rarely think this game is just crazy chaotic. Perhaps I still do not know how to ask questions, but the change of cards is ridiculous.

03/2011: Another 0.5 downward rating. With 6, this game just had no tension whatsoever. By the third mass, the game was almost over and we had already crossed out most of the suspsects on the list.

This is a very good game, but it plays to my weaknesses too much.  My memory is awful, and I don't really want to keep records detailed enough to make up for that.  Some of the event cards are annoying, but I guess those could be removed from the game.

We have improved the game with a house rule of randomly removing, and exposing, roughly a third of the monks, making sure that none are left over after the deal to be found at the Parlor.  These tweaks cut play time to a reasonable amt of time without changing flavor, strategy, anything else other than time.  In fact eliminating monks at the Parlor improves the game dramatically because as long as those monks are still out, questioning seems pointless.

I don't know if we we're playing this wrong but I found this great except how you score.
No one saw any reason to do midgame guesses because it gave other people more info and did not net enough point to beat someone who actually knew the answer.
We all basically figured it out simultaneously but I was closest to the room where you guess so I won. Literally I started my character towards the finish and all my friends went... "no!" and started after me but it was clear there was nothing they could do on their turns to beat me there and since I had the right answer I won. 
A lot of work for it to boil down to last minute positioning over actual brainwork. 
It was fun but we'd rather play something more balanced.

Wow. I really like games that have a lot of communication between the players, so this game gained points right off the bat because of its player interaction.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Whodunit in a "The Name Of The Rose"-type monastery setting, adding several layers of chrome over the basic "Clue" deductive game premise through specialized rooms and event cards. A significant degree of chaos results from cards being passed around at various points in the game, throwing a wrench in the usual deductive strategies. The really clever mechanism is the "open question" that players ask each other to narrow down the attributes of the guilty monk. Overall, Mystery of the Abbey provides an interesting experience but can sometimes drag if players have difficulty in coming up with good open questions. Works well if players enjoy the ride and don't take it too seriously. Components are wonderfully produced.

RATING: 6
While I don't mind the chaos of the Library, everyone should get an equally powerful effect, but they don't. It's also pretty long. Otherwise, an interesting and subtle game. It builds in tempo and the final scurrying for Revelations and Accusations is a lot of fun.  Very thematic. Also, somewhat fragile; a single mistake in record-keeping or a misstatement can create a really disappointing endgame (a flaw in the genre as a whole, of course).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
One of the most disappointing games I've played, and especially so since I dropped $50 on it to get it before a game night.  The deduction element isn't just weak, it's non-existent once the cards start getting passed around the table in large wads.

I've been told I just didn't have the right mentality going into it--it's not a deduction game, they say, it's more like a party game.  Maybe so, but I like deduction games a lot more than party games and this looked like it could've been a fun one...  Shelved after three plays or so, but I may give it another try when I'm ready to look at it objectively again.

Update: Given to my parents, who were interested.  Still want to give this another try.  In retrospect, I think I could like it better now that I know what to expect.  I do think all of the comments about how this is "Advanced Clue" or "Clue on Steroids" are waaay off the mark though.  I am completely and utterly baffled by the comments that it "takes the randomness out of Clue", etc.  Mystery of the Abbey is massively more random than Clue.  Anyway, this is a different sort of game entirely, and I think the people that call it a "deduction party game" are much closer to the mark.  If you want more hardcore deduction than Clue, you want something like Sleuth, not Mystery of the Abbey.

Beautiful bits. Very atmospheric. The Chaos factor is interesting but makes the deduction difficult. Fun in mixed company. Everyone always seems to be certain their system is working but the chaos proves them wrong. Rating loewered to 6 after four plays. It just seems to be less about deduction and more about atmosphere.

I am a fan of deduction style games.  This one, a rather old one, holds up pretty well.  There is a mechanism where you can ask other players a pretty open ended question that I think really works well.  If you like deduction, this is a must try at least.  If your non gamer friends like Clue, this is a great gateway.

A variation of Clue, where you unravel a murder mystery by deduction, questioning the other players to form the basis of your investigation.  More a kid's game than a serious adult game, although it certainly can be played and enjoyed by adults.

An interesting game in which I have done fairly well by what I would describe as foolhardy revelations. I made the revelations first and so no one can claim them. By the time I make my second revelation, everyone becomes convinced/worried that I am onto something and therefore drop any other strategy they might have had and run to make revelations and accusations.

Good deduction game.  Much better than Clue.  It has some random elements that are either add flavor or chaos depending on your point of view.  Slueth is a purer deduction game if that is your thing.  This one has more player interaction and a richer theme.

RATING: 8
Clue for thinking adults.  More interesting theme (who doesn't love a good Cadfael-esque mystery?) that shows through as a lot of flavor in the game, and the game mechanics themselves are less luck-ridden and reward deduction and deception better.  Very high quality components, as well!  I suppose it's technically a "German Game", but it's pretty clearly derivative of "Clue" (although superior) as a straight deduction game.

Horribly disappointed. The gameplay is tedious and the game is excruciatingly longwinded for the experience. The map is an unnecessary contrivance which just extends the game rather than add any real strategy element. Passing so many cards around reduces the need for true deduction, and the game drags on interminably with the wrong crowd. Would score even lower (aroud a 3 or 4) if it didn't have such great production quality.

The bits are beautiful and the game has a great theme, but...

There's quite a bit of luck in the game. This in itself is not bad, but the playing time is slightly too long compared to the amount of luck in the game. Often, it is just getting lucky with the cards and then hoping you are the first to reach the accusation room.

Coming up with clever questions that give you information, but don't give away information to the other players is the most interesting part of the game. However, again any clever questioning is often overridden by the large luck component in the game, which makes one wonder if it is worth to invest a great amount of mental energy in coming up with clever questions.

Finally, the scoring system is flawed. It is stupid to make an accusation if it will not win you the game, therefore the player who makes the correct accusation will always win the game, making the whole scoring points for correct revelations a bit moot.

I'm sure there is a great deduction game hidden somewhere in those components, but the current ruleset does not show us that game. Pity.

Tentative rating after one game with my wife and 7-year old son.  I like the game, but I want to play it more (especially with more people) before I can give it a "final" rating, so to speak.  Great theme, wonderful components (Days of Wonder edition).  A more random form of Clue...or is there something more?  Time will tell... Update: I never want to play this game again.  Way too random for my tastes, and way too long.

Still better than Clue (totally boring), but the game is sluggish until becomes clear to everyone who's the culprit... so the winner is the one runs faster than the others! Quite foolish for a game that promise to be "smart" instead. Still I can't give it less than 6.

Brilliant game.  I've always loved Cluedo - probably my favourite 'High Street' game - but it has a few too many issues, roll to move being a particular bug bear of mine.
Mystery of the Abbey took the Cluedo mold, took out the randomness, coated it heavily with theme, and made a great game from it.  Our first play of this led us to playing it twice more directly afterwards, the very mark of a great game.

Excellent game, it all depends on when Buell will arrive and how aggressive the Rebels are on the first day. If only those Corps Attack stoppages would hold.

The command system in this series is incredible. The command system makes this series an excellent choice for solitaire play.

Part of the CWB series of battles from MMP/The Gamers.  A very playable covering of the chaos of Shiloh that can be done in a reasonable amount of time.  Does a good job of covering the lack of command control that affected both armies.  Highly recommended.

RATING: 3
Very unbalanced in favor of the South :In spite of I received Buell in my first attempt as Yankee player (which was very lucky such the table is more severe than history arrival ) my opponent won easely the game!!.. Maybee the disadvantages against the nordist during the surprise attack are too hard. The south seems to have also too strong morale levels (average of B against C for the North), while historicaly there was as much green units in both side during this battle.
I will try "A Fearfull slaugther" instead

The CWB System is nevertheless very fun.

RATING: 2
I don't get why this series is so popular. This was my second attempt at playing this system and I remained unimpressed. It is a heavy tactical system lacking in elegance and fun. I just don't have the time to understand the complicated and verbose rules or check off ammunition boxes on paper buried deep inside of a rulebook. I didn't finish a turn, but I feel my views should be posted because this series gets a lot of praise. The components are hideous but better looking than some of the other games in the series.

I am a self-proclaimed fan boy of CWB series.  This is one of my favorites of the series.  Momentum swings heavily from intial Confederate attack to Union counterattack the next day.

Played once.  I like the CWB, but the battle of Shiloh is tough to game in any system.  Not my favorite CWB game, but still worth a play if you're a Civil War gamer.  Warning!  Staring at that map long enough may cause retinal burns.

Horrible, horrible map and some unclear rules on the initially encamped Union forces.  I greatly prefer the regimental equivalent (A Fearful Slaughter).

Interesting situation with the Union forces spread out and not alerted.  It is important to download the errata from The Gamers Archive - without it, the initial Rebel offensive would be too strong.

Bad map and Shiloh never seems to work well as a game for me. Perhaps because the area the conflict took place in was so wooded that it made moving around a touch more difficult. The system works for the battle but I'd rather play Thunder at the Crossroads or a few other titles in the series.

I like series games and I like the CWB. The combat system is too dice-roll-, table-, and bookeeping- heavy and the order system has still loopholes and can be misunderstood or abused.
But this games tell a great narrative, are immersive, great on historicity and good fun if played in the right mood.

Out of all The Gamers Brigade series games, this one is my favorite...

RATING: 7.5
Allow me to get this out early - I love the Gamers Brigade series games for the ACW.  The rules seem to do a great job of capturing the relative chaos of the battlefield, giving orders, etc.  In any game, you can go from amazing frustration at not having orders accepted to the euphoria of getting the right units moving at just the right moment.

However, the games are long and the mechanics are reasonably complex.  The order system can inject an amazing degree of chance (that's often balanced out) but occasionally makes units sit and do nothing for far, far too long due to some bad luck.  Throw in that's it's only two players and requires a lot of room and it just doesn't come out of the box often.

This just didn't grab me. The rules are complex with little pay off.

RATING: 9
Like the CWB command control, in Shiloh you quickly learn your defensible positions. Each time I've played it has played true to form - the first day the union pushed back to Pittsburg landing and the Confederates without the strength to make the last drive at the end of the day.
Last game as the confederates I kept AS Johnston out of the battle until the very end of the day when I needed his morale boost - you guessed first time - snake-eyes - Poor Albert Sidney some things are fated.

RATING: 3
I have only read the rules.  Please, beware, this is not a normal wargame.  Or ANY from this series.  You must track much more information than your usual wargame.  I have not played.  But after reading the rules, I am not sure I want to.  It could be a blast, but. . .  Just as a disclaimer, I do play ASL.

RATING: 8
Enjoyed the game, really like the CWB system.  In our session of AH the Confederates were doing very well, then stalled along the sunken road and didn't follow orders for hours.  Buell came in at 1100 on the first day and by evening the Union had such a solid line that the Confederates packed it in--which is the one gripe that we had about AH, that the Buell die roll can be a game breaker, for either side, since he might not have come in at all.  We have decided that next time we will play either using Buell's historical entry time or adapting the variable reinforcement system in August Fury II and some other CWB titles. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Shiloh -- certainly a tricky battle to game -- Buell's arrival is key and turns the game into two distinct battles: the Rebel assault and attempt to rout the surprised Union before they grind to a halt, and the Union sweep of the field the following morning (or whenever Buell arrives if the Union hasn't been horribly shattered during the first day).

The map is, well, colorful -- too colorful <g> -- turn up the house lights.  Not a bad treatment of the battle, but not a personal favorite.  No guarantee Buell will arrive...

confusing battle due to confederate surprise and union unit still encamped. The situation is stressfull as you will try to make a nice defensive line with your union troops !

Another CWBS game on a well known battle.  
This is a very good series and does a good job of depicting ACW combat at this level.  The FOW is handled very well and the bookkeeping is not as bad as first thought.  

I just do not have the time to dedicate to this series.  There is just too much detail, it is almost too good a simulation.

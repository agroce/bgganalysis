I'm enthusiastic, but I have grave doubts and concerns about how this is going to turn out. Ares/OSS, the KS managers, are taciturn, uncommunicative, and seemingly disconnected from the game and its audience/fans. The components seem like they'll be no better than 2e. The work they put into it was the rules, and even those were revised/edited by supporters/HF fans (the PDFs of the formatting struck me as pretty amateurish and uninspired from what's purportedly a game/magazine publishing company). [b]I'll likely never back another project from these guys again[/b] (fool me once, and all that). I suppose the upside is that the game will no longer be out of print?

Super complex but also super rewarding!  Executing a plan feels so good!  Your choices are often incredibly tough and complex as you try to implement a plan, or find one, in the face of other, possible, random elements (events, hazards).  I LOVE IT!!!  Definitely not for everyone, but definitely for me.

Includes:
High Frontier - Basic Game
High Frontier - Colonization - Advanced Game (with solitaire variants) 
Interstellar - Solitaire Game (very different from the main games)

Extremely complex and demanding. The rules are terrible to read. Hard to get into. But, it seems to be rewarding and worth the effort.

RATING: 4
This is a massive undertaking and it felt much more like a simulation than a game - I suspect it's more interesting as a solo exercise because it felt an administrative task rather than being a "game" - I wouldn't say any of the 5 of us had "fun" and unusually for our group we allowed other players to re-do actions and routes simply because otherwise they would just be dead or spending several turns on a planet just getting fuel. It maybe realistic but it's not fun

A deep, fascinating game -- possibly my favorite game (or tied with Up Front!).  Rating it a 10 is not the same thing as saying it is "perfect".  The 3rd edition has a two cards that are misprinted (easily fixed though) and other niggles here and there, but nothing significant to detract from the game play.  The new fuel strip, the lander burns and the consolidated rulebook all make this the best edition of HF yet.

3/27/17:  Haha, they spelled the designer's name wrong on the box.  Not a good sign.

If you're used to a lot of modern games, you're going to be disappointed in the bits.  The pieces look like an afterthought in a game that weighs 10 lbs.  The rulebook(s) will drive you to the edge, and then the board will push you over, into the abyss.

Compared to other Eklund's, I can tell that a lot of feedback went into this edition.  The rulebook is well indexed and readable.  There are still editing improvements that I'd make, but that's by the way.  It's still like reading a manual to some obscure piece of technical machinery, but you can cross-reference and jump around very easily and it is necessary to do so while learning the game.  

Still available from the OSS website for $99+20 shipping.

3/22/17: Delivered after 20 months.

Definitely hard to process. A lot of options up front when the player is least able to deal with them. Took my 3 games to just build a factory. But interesting. If played often enough (the exact number depends on how fast you get it) the basic game will lose its luster and you'll want to try the advanced game. That may make it difficult to get to the table in a mixed group. Still, interesting.

An incredibly immersive experience, made even better by tweaking and balancing patents, colonist and futures. 

As for 2nd edition Colonization, it does take a long time to play with all modules, pbem really a must. My own experience with 2 player pbem full game averages around 50-60 years of game play: that's 50-60 turns each, 150+ vlogs exchanged, 500+ emails. Warning: don't try this if you have work to get done or just want to keep a social life/wife.

In 2014 I purchased the 2nd edition of High Frontier and all the expansions for about $200 (this was when it was out of print, and I gambled that it would never be reprinted because it is such a niche game). I was wrong, in 2015 I see the 3rd edition announced. Before that I was able to play my copy once, by myself...I was a little disappointed with my timing; just my bad luck!  

But I am backing the new edition anyway. I was totally thrilled to have this unique original game for $200.  Honestly, if it wasn't a reprint but the designer of the game emailed me and told me he had reworked the game and will send me all the updated material for $60 bucks, I would have done it in a heartbeat. So I am happy to reach a little further now and own this highest form of the game.  

I'm not sure what I'll do with the old material, one idea is to frame the maps? So, in the end I'll be just under $300 for this game, I can't win them all. My overspending isn't the game's fault.

Man, is this a heavy trip. It reeks of intense research and is a "must try" for anyone who fancies himself a budding rocket scientist. "Firefly" this is not, although there are faint echoes.  It is first and foremost all about mass, thrust and fuel management, and it takes some (a lot actually) getting used to. Once you get over and around the logistics, it is all about exploring for resources (dice driven and very unforgiving) and building factories out there somewhere (kind of like stars in Scythe) which, after the requisite number are build by someone, ends the game. Victory points from there which are collected via various means. Expect it to be an extremely long game. Twilight Imperium long, but with a fairly narrow fun spectrum (not everyone is going to find the game interesting enough to spend the time you need to get through it). Maybe an acquired taste? I thought I'd like it, and while I admire the work that went into it along with the high quality production values, but I'm not sure how likely it is that I'd ever play it again...

Phil Eklund is slowly becoming, in my estimation, the most overrated designer in modern board gaming. His games are way too long, way too random, and although they're always very interesting in concept, are usually failures in execution. 

Unfortunately, High Frontier is just another example of the bloated Eklund style. The income mechanic alone (i.e. you initially make income only from auctioning/selling tech or passing for $1) is so clunky and poorly designed that it truly amazes me to see people continue to praise this game, especially after two previous editions had opportunity to improve on this clumsy system. 

Add to this the completely unfun mechanic that, after 30-45 minutes of passing/auctioning just to finally get your ship out to a planet, a single die roll determines whether you can mine it, and a threat roll may even instantly make your ship blow up. This is what my husband (a theoretical physicist) spent several evenings struggling with the rulebook for? This is what we players spent an hour sitting through the most convoluted rules explanation ever for? Roll a die and see if you blow up? This is simply bad game design. I can only believe that a peculiar blend of egoism and hero worship is what motivates Eklund's fans to continue hyping and playing his boring, bloated games.

Likely prescient economics-meets/and-physics simulation of the (hopefully) coming solar system industrialization space-race. Possibly the greatest difficult modern game yet created.

The new third edition (which the publisher in charge of the Kickstarter managed to turn into a stressful "death-march" for all involved) does have an improved fuel-thrust tracking diagram, two sizes of board, four expansive rule books with more modern and approachable art and graphic design. High quality card stock. Unique, although not very accurate thematically, rocket tokens. 

The culmination of years of refinement, the 3rd edition of High Frontier is the most realistic, accurate, and possibly, prescient, quasi-"4x" (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit and in this case, eXtrapolate) simulation in any format outside the halls of the world's space institutions. 

Literally more of a "teach-in" or "seminar" than a game. Fan-produced walk-throughs and rules flow-charting probably essential for new players.

Only thing missing is Andrew Doull's excellent "Galactic" expansion.

The only game that I have found that will think about for days after playing. There are so many things to to do, so many ways to do them, and so many ways to improve on what you have done before. What is better than figuring out new places to fly to in the solar system and how best to accomplish heroic deeds that the world will talk about for decades.

Not as complicated as it looks... unless you want it to be.  My lone astronaut abandoned on mars (we'll call him Mark Watley) spent 10 years perfecting a new thruster technology while awaiting his eventual rescue.  A hero back on Earth, he oversees the missions to the asteroid belt, and then further to a moon of Jupiter using his technology.  It has been a long and appreciated career for Mark.  So much fun, as long as you can will yourself to do some planning and then stick to that plan.

RATING: 10
Some 30 years in the making, this seems like Eklund's masterpiece. It's greatness is also owed to the legion of tireless fans that honed high Frontier into a sharp competitive game that offers players one of the best  auction, logistics, or race games ever made.  The learning curve, even smoothed by the extra booklets will be nonetheless daunting for new players, but the game is without parallel and well-deserving of their time.

Even just the basic game is more than enough to interest gamers looking for a challenge. Start slow and work your way to the full set of rules over a couple dozen plays.  

The complete game is a sight to behold and worth the effort it takes to get there. High Frontier is a singular achievement in game design.

Eklund^2. If you have played before any of his games, you know what to expect. Hard science, deep decision space, intriguing complexity, but also lots of randomness and rulebook delving. This is in principle a simple game to play, but to play well and without big rules faux-pas, that's another story altogether. Still, if you consider yourself a heavy gamer and an admirer of astrophysics and space sciences, you ought to play HF. The solo game works marvelously, and the components are stellar (except I'm always worried I'll tear the huge map up. What a blast!

An absolute behemoth of a game.

This is a "must buy" for anyone interested in a space exploration/colonization/political game who is tired of the magical thinking involved with faster-than-light travel.  The game system ingeniously and elegantly incorporates near-future technologies and Newtonian mechanics into a smooth and seamless gaming experience.  A training manual helps gamers rapidly come up to speed with the novel simulation of gravity wells and spaceship movement.  Well worth every dollar.

All about that space.

High Frontier is easily in my top five games, and has been forever. The subject matter is deeply appealing to me, and High Frontier captures the hard-science and speculative fiction of advanced rocket design and exploiting the solar system like nothing else.

Aside from being highly thematic, with experienced players it manages to produce a tightly competitive game - you are usually in complete control of how much risk you're willing to take, even if you can control how much risk you can afford taking.

It is a long complex game with alot of things to remember. 

I like the complexity having to think, but some of the things I have to remember could have been made easier or more intutitive. 

You go on missions that take many turns and while executing them your turn is quick. When someone is deciding on what mission to do that can take quite some time with beginners. So downtime can be huge. 

The map is quite hard to understand and the graphic desing and art of the game does not try to help at all. 

It is also quite hard to get some engine going. You spend most of the game doing what feels like inefficient turns to get a point or two. 

The by far worst thing about the game is the rolls. Hazards what kill you on 1. Think and play for a few hours, then roll a die. If you roll a 1 you will not win. There is some tension there but I have a hard time trying to come up with something worse to put in a game. You could pay alot to not have to roll, but to much to not almost always take the chance. 

There are also rolls you do on planets to see if you find anything. And there you also only have 1 chance a bad roll and you will most likely not win. 

Still I kind of like the game. I like the thinking, the complexity and I quite like the slow pace. And also the auction part is actually really good. Will perhaps play again and glad I played. But not a game I would ever try to play with friends.

[i]If you are at all interested in space science and exploration you should totally get this and play the hell out of it.[/i]

After 40+ face-to-face plays, [i]High Frontier[/i] is my all-time favorite game, with whatever stupid box of cardboard and plastic that's #2 on my list at least a billion klicks behind.  I will be playing this for the rest of my life.

Here's what you need to know to have the greatest chance of success:

[b]1.  It's not casual.[/b]
The rules and systems, while actually pretty simple, are presented in the most obtuse way possible.  This makes it [i]seem[/i] terribly complicated, with a grotesque amount of effort required to get over the hump where it begins to click and make obvious sense.  This isn't a "pickup and play" game—it's a process of experience that grows as you explore the rules, systems, and possibilities.

[b]2.  Ease into it.[/b]
Understand that the game will not achieve full bloom until all the players are intimately familiar with the technology cards, the map, and the synergies they suggest.  This takes time—time spent playing many games together.  It's best done as a stair-step process, beginning with the basic game and only adding a new module when everyone is comfortable with the current rules overhead and interested in exploring another layer of complication.  Rush it and you'll turn players off or burn them out; take your time and you can play it forever.

[b]3.  The true essence of the thing is revealed as you explore it.[/b]
Reading all the rules and cards tells you as much about the game as looking at an exploded view of a kitten tells you about tummy rubs and purring.  The exploration process above isn't half-measures or training wheels for n00bs—it [i]is[/i] the game.  The learning process through play is the thing.  So relax and enjoy!

[hr]
Full disclosure:  I don't own this edition as I already have all the previous stuff, including several copies of the poster map, and players in my group who [i]never[/i] buy games bought all the previous stuff as well—and it all still plays perfectly fine.  If I did own this edition I'm sure it would be an easy 10, flaws and all.

That said, here are more reasons why you should seek this out and play it—some of the minor details may have been tweaked for the 3rd edition but the feels are still real:

This rating is based on my playing the Tabletop version utilizing the 3rd edition "living rules".

Once I had a firm grasp of the mechanics and functioning of the game, I found a very challenging (satisfyingly so) game that was tense, deep, and both agonizing in failure and immensely rewarding in success. I think it's a great game, and is incredibly fun in the "brain burner" sense. 

But there is a very big problem with this game, and why it gets only a middling rating from me right now. I'll start by saying it took me at least 5 days of trying off and on to play it before I finally felt I had a grasp of enough of the game to play it competently. I had to put a LOT of effort into learning this one, and not in a good way. The game is not overly complicated or complex. It's not overly finicky (I would say the density of the game matches what it is simulating in a good way). I've played games with just as much rules complexity as this one and have been able to get started within the first half hour of sitting down and digesting it all. What was the problem with this one?

The answer is the rulebook. I've heard that it was the previous editions' achilles heel as well, and that a lot of effort went into revamping the rulebook for this edition, and all I can say is that if the current state of the rulebook is the best it has ever been, then yikes. It still needs an overhaul, and badly. The problem is in the structuring of the rules. There's no progression or arc to it to make the concepts and mechanics it contains more digestible. It just throws everything at you in sections and subsections with no flow or sense of logic. Certain sections reference rules that have not yet been discussed, which makes it impossible to understand the game and proceed to the next section without first referencing the future rule it references. And then that rule will then reference a different section that has yet to be examined, and so on. This makes it so you are continually jumping back and forth through the entire rulebook, forgetting the original rule you were trying to understand in the first place. It's like a bad choose your own adventure where the adventure is deciphering what a particular rule actually dictates. There are also multiple instances where very important concepts and terms it references only appear in the glossary, not even in the rules themselves. That is just baffling. Making it even more of an ordeal is the fact that even though the game is separated into a "basic" version and an "advanced" version, the crossover in rules discussion for both versions in each section makes it overwhelming when simply trying to decipher how to play the basic version. Essentially, I tried to start out learning only the "basic" version of the game, and giving that a test run, but ended up basically just learning to play the advanced version anyway. This wasn't too much of a problem, as it feels like the advanced version is definitely the "real" version of the game, and how it's intended to be played. But for the sake of barrier to entry, this is not necessarily a good thing for brand new players trying to teach themselves the game. 

In short, I practically gave up, and were it not for me having absolutely nothing better to do one particular weekend, I would have. And that's a shame because the game really is quite good. But if merely learning how to play the game is that much of a struggle, it's hard to feel like it's worth it, regardless of how good the game is.

Kickstarted 3rd ed. after owning 2nd ed. for quite a while. It is a demanding game, but so very satisfying when you actually achieve something. I took it slow and re-learned everything, playing first the base game and then continued to add Colonization modules. I love the sandbox aspect and even when I fail (quite a lot), there is no real sense of losing as such. It's space after all, a very unforgiving environment. Every game is different, every game brings it's own challenges. Tried sailing through the solar system? I love it!

This very realistic sim game for space exploration has really, really piqued my interest on theme alone. A heavy, heavy, heavy game that I think will max out the amount of game that I can handle. Though I don't really plan on playing this with my SO, maybe some of the included solo games will get here interested. I expect this one to sit on the table for days when it finally hits.

This game is perfect for you if, when growing up, you and all your friends wanted to work for NASA... but while they were all focused on being an astronaut, you wanted to work for mission control.  I've never before found a game with such a detailed yet approachable representation of orbital mechanics, including things like variable fuel consumption rates based on the current weight of your rocket (which is affected by how much fuel you're still carrying!).  When playing it, I feel like I'm really organizing interplanetary missions at NASA.

In the end I'm glad I got this for the bigger map, the Interstellar map (though I had a low-res print), and in particular the blue water tokens.  As a game, this is less than the sum of the expansions.  The rulebook bloat is incredible, and the bland formatting of the rulebooks puts me to sleep.   Whoever forgot to put the Basic and Advanced Rules on the front of the booklet that also contains the Colonization rules should be fired.  (Presumably it was an ardent fan of the game who considers it unimaginable that players could stick with less than everything and people shouldn't be pointed towards where those rules are. Actually, those rulebooks tell me that the complexity of the expansions has likely progressed past the point where it's fun for me.) 

Overall, am most likely to continue playing with the earlier rules using the new maps and water tokens.

Provisional rating based on a single play of the basic game. Definitely an experience game, but the experience offered appears worth the price of admission. A lot of the randomness can be mitigated with cautious play, but it also really depends on what you're able to get going. While HF holds the promise of a space exploration sandbox, the reality is that you'll have to build your game around what cards come up that you're able to get. Knowing the board well pays big dividends and I can see better how running small, manageable missions can then lead to more ambitious craziness later on. Would love to try the full game with events, supports, politics, etc.

High Frontier is a heavy space exploration game. The players take control of different space enterprises trying to establish factories on planets and asteroids. Each player begins with three water tanks (fuel). In turns each player uses two action points to do some of the eight actions available, e.g. move space ship or buy new technologies. When the predetermined number of bases is built the game ends. The winner is the player with most victory points.

The 3rd edition (2015/2016) is supposedly a deluxe edition, kickstarted by One Small Step games, includes both the High Frontier base game and the Colonization expansion as well as 31 new card designs and redesigned charts. The rules are in four volumes: Basic, Colonization, Interstellar, and Super-Advanced Variants.

Buyer beware: the kickstarter has been experiencing problems...

I may be preemptively jumping the gun on this one, but even the basic game is incredible. I started out using the full map, but I'm planning on just using half until I start to learn the actual game and the intricacies that are involved. From initially reading the rules, I felt like this game might be too simple, but once I started to get into it, playing around with outposts, freighters, burns, fly-bys, factories....ugh! So much to sink your teeth into even if it doesn't appear so at first glance. I do think this game will go from being great to amazing once you start to add in the modules from Colonization or any of the variants that are tucked away.

I plan on starting and staying with the basic game until I feel ready to add more. I realize it's like playing Dominion with just the base game kingdom cards and once you add in all of Colonization, it's like adding in 8 additional expansions. The games dynamic hasn't changed drastically, but the possibilities are endless.

On a side note, I will say that the rules for this version are atrocious somehow even worse then the 2nd edition rulebook. The basic game rules seem to be co-mingled with some of the colonization rules, stuff is only referenced in the index which is important and none of it has a flow that a normal rulebook would have. Not to mention but the "read this first" rulebook was not helpful in understanding the game flow. It helped introduce context for the rules, but it failed to give a nice rundown of a game turn. I found the rules easier to read, but harder to understand in this edition. High Frontier Alive and Complete is a much easier to understand rulebook and really should have been the basis with additional pictures. I'm very tempted to create a rulebook for just the basic game, but I understand it's a lot of work. I'd love it if GMT could do the rulebook for this game. Sweet baby jesus it would be so much better.

Played for first time for our group.  We all prepared by reading manuals (ugh) and watching whatever videos were available (also ugh).  Overall we ended the game (about 7 hours on basic) with mixed feelings.  As we started to really grasp what we were doing (about 4 hours in) the game began to shine, but we just couldn't get over how god awful the manuals are.  I mean these are supposedly updated from the previous versions?  The manuals are so unusable, incomplete, poorly laid out, and just a drudge to work with that it weighs down heavily on the game.  Look at previous comments and you see that the consensus is "the best way to learn this game is to have someone else teach you."  While that is a nice thought, it is by no means to base an ongoing method of learning a game.  Beyond the atrocious instructions, the game is beautiful.  We played with the oversized board, and while much of it wast not used  what an amazing thing to lay it out.  Totally worth a portion of the board hanging off the edges of our already large table.  We feel that we need to go through this a few more times, read more erratas to find out where we were doing things wrong (you will most definitely do things wrong, but thats part of the learning)  and perhaps adjust scoring as needed.  But please, do something with these instructions.  After 15 years of development there just is no excuses for these to even get past an editor.  (or find a new editor)

I can't give this a rating yet. One play, and I am still trying to wrap my head around thrush and fuel calculations. There are some exceptional things about this game but then there are some shallow aspects that don't fully deliver on the vision. I need to play this further to figure out how I feel. It could go either way. Also, we only played the basic rules and I feel like a lot of the magic is probably missing in the basic rules.

I really should rate this a 1, but the experience of learning this puzzle was enjoyable, so I boost it to 2. This simply is not a game. It is a static simulation. Nothing about the simulation changes with each play. Same cards, same board - you can choose a different starting country but nothing actually changes. The auction-income generation system is just a horribly boring time waste; not a single game I can think of does auctions this way, I don't understand how others can think this is an ingenious system, that every other game designer using an auction economy has not chosen this system. There's a reason - it sucks. The implementation of threat and especially prospect rolls makes several hours of puzzle-solving depend on a few die rolls, which completely breaks the simulation. NASA doesn't land rockets with a 1/6 chance of explosion or visit a planet, fail to find resources the first time and then be sure there's no resources. Rolling a lucky 1 on an asteroid allows you to build a factory and discover great technology, but an unlucky 6 on a 5- size planet means there's nothing there permanently. This game is like taking a hard Suduko, solving it, rolling a die to see if you get credit for solving it, then erasing it and doing the same Suduko the next night. Take everything I'm saying with a big grain of salt - there's still a lot of additional rules I haven't learned, but as it won't fundamentally change the non-game but just add more to the puzzle, I have zero interest. So much potential, so disappointed, such a waste.

This game is a masterpiece in using relatively simple mechanics to portray a great deal of complexity.

All time favorite game. It's narrative is engrossing, the achievements are well earned and the solar system sandbox is wide open. It's pure space exploration with calculated risks that give a beautiful sense of accomplishment (even when you slam into Saturn's Rings disintegrating your spacecraft). Add all the modules together and the game has endless playability.

This has been my favorite title for years and I always get that giddy feeling when my bernal reaches a dirt-side, when I've emancipated a robot colonist or successfully created a GW thruster for some truly deep exploration.

Kickstarter (regrettably) means having to endure Ares Magazine/One Small Step's continuous falsehoods and buffoon-like antics. Never again.

What a major disappointment to see the divisiveness that this campaign has generated online as hobbyists turn on each other. Shame on Ares/OSS for locking out the designer - Phil Eklund - very early in the process, and for igniting the public (and private) conflict with their egregious KS campaign.

OK, I have the final product and it actually looks OK. Some sloppy areas and errata issues, unfortunately. It is a definite improvement of the 2nd edition, but I don't think I'd remotely call this a "Deluxe" version of the game. There is a ton of stuff in the very heavy box (the enlarged, double-sized map is a nice touch). 

HF is a *great* game once fathomed (it's one of the most ingenious designs ever published), so there's consolation in that.

I'm fond of the graphics and am glad they remained basically the same.

Of note, players should not read the so called Training Guide first, contrary to what's stated - the Guide is an incomplete and weakly edited booklet that leaves more questions than answers. Read the Colonization booklet's Basic Game first. 

Despite the protestations of HF royalty, it's still going to be an arduous struggle for newbies because so many concepts are obtuse and not clearly presented (again, poor editing here as a plethora of things are just thrown at you). Many of the illustrations in the rules being perfunctory or even in error certainly doesn't help.

Tough for me to rate (I'll start at an 8), my love of the design being in conflict with my disdain for Ares/OSS. I only hope it's enough for new players to get over the hump in order to enjoy the HF experience. We'll see...

Anyway, the ultimate sandbox game that easily can provide years (decades) of enjoyment. A hobby landmark design to be sure.

This is Phil Eklund's masterpiece. A remarkable creation, an inspiring and addicting blend of science and gaming even by his standards. I've played some Origins and Megafauna as well, and High Frontier is clearly a step above them in balance, coherence, and playability. For all the complexity of the game, the rules are fundamentally sound and carefully expressed. I'm usually the type to find obscure rules questions that aren't nailed down by the text, but I haven't found anything through the core rules so far that isn't answered by a careful reading - a real accomplishment in a ruleset of this complexity. Some of the variants and supplementary material aren't up to quite the same (very) high standard, but the core game is rock solid.

There are some unfortunate production problems in the 3rd edition - obvious card and playmat misprints that should have been caught, and an awkward quick start book that's difficult to learn from without guidance. Some of the bits feel rather cheap for what's supposedly an ultimate edition. But those are all minor, correctable issues in the long run. The game is far too unique and magnificent to be dragged down by them.

I've played half a dozen basic games with a variety of opponents and player counts at this point, as well as a shocking number of hours of solitaire play using all the rules modules in the CEO variant. I haven't remotely lost interest and neither have my opponents. I expect regular, tense matches of High Frontier to continue for years to come.

Played 2nd edition 9 times and then got the 3rd ed. This improves on 2nd ed. but is still not perfect. However, both are pure 10's anyway. Worth a special mention is the huge map on the backside of the regular and interstellar map, just wow!

This game is so unlike other games that I have a hard time knowing what it is, game or just a simplified boardgame-disguised simulation. The gameplay feels like it should be boring and achieving any results is very difficult, but somehow I really feel like I'm in charge of a space agency. Even managing a trip to the moon is a huge effort and the feeling of satisfaction is awesome once you finally get there. All in all I don't know what this is but I know it has been a long time since I smiled so much after a game. This is the perfect experience, but I'm still not sure whether it is a game or simulation and I still don't care about who wins.

Our playgroup is definately not a bunch of casual stupid kimble players, quite the opposite, but the game throws such a huge challenge that even though rules are relatively simple and logical in the background the possible combinations of rocket/mission planning become very tough to wrap your head around.

All being said, this game is really not for everyone, but I personally found the holy grail of boardgames. Space-nerds and gamers capable of handling the challenge are guaranteed to get their kicks from this while others might find it frustrating and never leave LEO.

It's good. With all the modules I'd wager to say it's about as complex as a game of Mage Knight, and I get a similar puzzle solving vibe for it. The theme though is less pasted on than with Mage Knight. Beautiful board. Would always play.

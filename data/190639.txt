Zany Penguins looks like a kids' game, but there's a bit more to it than that.  Essentially, it is about the impossible task of getting the highest total in a suit of cards on the table in front of you, while keeping high value cards of the suit in hand.  The requirement to pass a card to left and right each round adds another level of angst.  A few cards have special abilities that work fine, with the exception of the bomber.  The bomber eliminates cards of value 7+ and is common enough that sensible players simply keep those cards in hand.  Although I expect play to become formulaic quite quickly I also think that Zany Penguins could retain a role as a quick, charming, easily explained filler.

Production quality of the cards is as poor as the embossed tin is good.  The cartoony artwork is vivid and functional.  The rules are fine.

The cute artwork goes a long way here, as does the theme of penguins taking over the world after being evicted by global warming. At its heart, though, it's a colorful, light card game with some drafting, majority set collection and some special ability cards that add just a fraction of strategy and depth. Fun.

Quick card game with majority scoring system that forces you to balance the cards in your tableau and in your hand. You can't be too obvious too early on, since majority of your cards are given to you by the other players. Looks pretty light, but really isn't.

Bruno Cathala's name on the box made me break my 'don't buy games with mad/crazy/zany in the title' rule. I'm glad I did. This is a slick, quick and cute (the artwork and presentation are top notch) implementation of the 'you have to play the cards you really want to keep' quandry with some nice wrinkles and tough choices arising from the card passing, gradually growing hand size and the scoring rules. Recommended for a quick filler/finisher.

First, I do think the box deserve a better scores!!

Bought a second-handed box from a boardgame shop, love it and bought a new one
Guys who think it's an easy game to teach newbie to let them enter the boardgame field (my thought), please throw the thought away and treat it as short game with experience mid+ boardgame players

for newbie:
- boring, they will just draw and pass the cards without any "purpose" 
- not excited enough, will know the score at the last step and nothing "surprise" in between
- Nothing to think on why, how to pass cards

from me and my friend (mid to heavy gamers)
- many things to handle, hands, tables cards
- card drafting, prevent passing the same cards, pick "rubbish" cards
- overall cards management
- cards and mind reading, card memory

My advice, please keep the game and you will enjoy it until someday!
It's a good game for gamers to have a "relax period" within 10-15mins

At last, This box DESERVE a better scores!

Cheers, Cerberus

Fun game of playing cards to gain majorities in the different sets but you score the value of the cards in your hand so you need to keep some higher cards to score with. Neat game of trying to balance what to play against what to score. 2 Plays

RATING: 6
Heard about this game on /r/boardgames on reddit. It sounds like it's a quick drafting game, but with an Arboretum-like element. I bought it as a gateway game, but I don't know if it's mean or not.

After playing it, I don't think it's as mean of a card game as I thought it was going to be. However, it's not an easy game to teach - between the scoring and the drafting, it was confusing to beginning gamers.

I suspect that explaining the scoring better ("only cards in your hand will score points - depending on what's on the table") might help.

I also think a prompt like "OK, everyone pass a card to the right - but don't look at it yet!" will fix some of the drafting confusion. We had some players will too many cards, and people that passed more cards because they couldn't remember if they passed cards or not.

It's not quite the Arboretum killer I was hoping for, but I still think the game shows promise. I think players will understand the game after repeated plays.

It is a unique take on a drafting game, whereby there's some tough decisions with regards to what cards you are going to pass to your neighbours, what cards to keep on hand and what cards to play on your tableau. Feels like a combination of Sushi Go with Arboretum. Add it to your library if you don't already have many drafting games.

The passing strategy seems pretty pedestrian: pass to your opponent a card of a suit  that he is not collecting. Deciding which cards to play and keep takes a bit more thought. You can try to go strong in one suit or to get smaller pieces of multiple suits.

It's the "thinking-man's" Sushi-go if you like simple drafting and tracking what will help/hurt your own score as well as your opponents.

Global warming is causing the icecaps to melt, so what are the penguins going to do about it?
Try to take over the world!

Really interesting balance here as you need the majority in a colour to score the highest card in your hand that shares that colour. 
If you dont have a majority then you will score the lowest card in your hand for each colour.

The artwork on this is really good and game play is simple, fast but fun so this will definitely be staying in my collection.

The passing and hand-management mechanism are great, and the juxtaposition between stilted military jargon (the "Troop Disembarkation" phase...) and adorable penguins is also great. But in my one 3p play, everybody scored nearly all of their hand and we finished within two points of each other. In short: might need more risky moves.

Much more than meets the eye. Put a train theme on this and it's a super filler. Aside from the theme-depth mismatch, the game is insanely cool. The card sharing, when coupled with the majorities and score-your-lowest mechanism, can lead to some serious strategic implications.

Nothing particularly original or novel in this game.  Also, the art of the cards and theme is uninspired.  The game works fine, the mechanics are good and well tested.  I just don't particularly care much for card drafting games, even ones as polished as 7 Wonders.  They are games that in spite of the card exchanges always feel more like MPS to me.  Also, I don't get excited by a game mechanic based on "one's person junk is another's treasure," where the choices are how to stiff your opponent and how to guess what others will dump on you, a game based on giving and receiving the least valuable items.

A game with a silly theme, but enough strategy and yet can be played in less than 15 minutes. Good for families and very portable. I will say the only issue is that if you sleeve the cards it is a challenge to make them fit in the tin. We play with my younger daughter and she loves it (and I do too)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's hard to say where I stand on this game. There is so much randomness. The cards in your draw pile are random. The order you draw them out is random. The cards you receive from other players during drafting is random. The cards they play are random and often unpredictable. There's just not a lot of control. I picked this up thinking that it would be a gamer version of Sushi Go, and it is better than Sushi Go, MUCH BETTER (with Sushi Go not really being a game IMO). But it's not real gamey, at least not with non-gamers. I'd be interested to see what it's like with fellow gamers rather than muggles. Conversely, if you go in with the mindset that this is a highly luck-driven family game, I don't think you will be disappointed. It's cute, it's got a small footprint, it plays fast and it's got the fun-factor. I would caution people, however, that this game is a bit hard to wrap your head around, despite its feather-light complexity. So, all in all, a good game if you approach it with the right mindset.

I like the drafting mechanic and I like how mindless the AI moves are. I tend to have a bit of AP with this because I think my mind is slowing down in my old age and I can't multitask (which card to discard? which to keep? to whom would I discard which card?) but I think that wouldn't be a problem if we played with more than 2.

**7.5 if two-player because playing two imaginary people is confusing, but 9 if other real people played because it's fun and easy to explain.

Video review - https://youtu.be/EE3TviX0q5I

Zany Penguins is a fun, quick, clever card game with a little zing. It has a pseudo drafting system where you pass one card to the player on your left and one to the player on your right. The clever thing though, is the scoring. You are attempting to gain the majority (highest numerical value) of a colour on the table, in order to score cards of that colour in your hand OR you are looking to thin down the cards of a colour in your hand because if you don't have a majority you score the lowest of that colour in your hand. It's a clever system that makes you really think about your choices. Well worth a look.

OMG the card backs! The card art! So freaking adorable! I was worried that the game would NOT live up to the cuteness, but I am really smitten with this little card game. It is fast-paced with little to no down time and loaded with thorny choices despite have extremely simple rules. Quick to teach and plays in about 20 minutes and if fun enough to warrant multiple plays whenever it hits the table.

RATING: 5
A light and simple  game of card play, hand management and set collection with master of world points. The theme is weak being a penguin that wants to take over the world. The game design requires that players set up tableau of cards based on colors and the cards have special powers.  The  base mechanism has a forced card drafting element.

Similar to, but not as draft-y as, Sushi Go, with a nice short play time and some tough decisions in there. The deal can hose you, but there is a good amount of strategy and tactics involved, as well as a dose of luck. The scoring can be confusing for first time players: double-check they know what is going to happen; then check again.

Nice filler card management game, with an interesting scoring mechanism. You score all the cards of a colour left in your hand if you have the maximum points of that card played down (so you need to balance), or you score the lowest card in your hand of a colour (so you need to balance again!)

RATING: 6.4
Ok, so long as I don't take it competitively.

Needs the ability to have a symmetric or balanced start.
Players are dealt decks at the beginning of the game that can be massively better or worse than other player's decks. This is mathematically identical to drawing a card from a communal deck in turn order ... but gives a worse feeling.

Looks like a REALLY fun set collection and hand management game. You want to have the biggest value of played cards, but you won't score them. You only score the points for cards that are left in your hand. Tough decisions to strike a balance of what to play and what to keep. Also card passing and some cards with special abilities.

Only played 2-player so far, with 2 programed players who we call Fred and Barney.

I'm sure this will be better with 3 or 4 but we like it as a quick game with some good choices and lots of fun. Nothing ground-breaking but an interesting scoring mechanism make it a nice addition to my collection. 

You're trying for majority control of each color on the table which decides how many of the cards in your hand will score. If you have the majority, you score all the cards of that color; if you only have a presence, you will score only the smallest value card of that color. This actually makes for some meaningful decisions even in a two-player game.

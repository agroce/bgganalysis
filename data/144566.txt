Just fantastic. I like the theme, and the hand management, and the constrained choices, and the money management, and the decisions about how to build your circus, and the random tile draws, and the luck of the dice. Just the right degree of player interaction. Works very well at 2p.

Plus, my wife is crazy in love with this game (like, borderline Agricola-crazy about it), which pretty much cements it in my top 5.

A euro with theme!  I don't see that every day.  You hire talent and perform in cities to score victory points and make money to pay your talent.  It's a really neat concept.

RATING: 8.5
A cool crossover game that doesn’t fit easy classification. Play it as a euro, stay out of each other’s way, and maximize your VPs. Okay, but then there are dice, random events/board makeup, and a CDG hand-management aspect, so a pure themed math exercise isn’t all that easy or feasible. Play it as a quasi-wargame and work your neighbors over every chance you get. Now that’s fun, isn’t it? I sure think so. 

Important, oft-overlooked American history baked in. Fantastic art and components. Advanced and Optional rules if you want to up the complexity. (Which you do.) Great stories generated every time. Just an excellent game, period. Big kudos to Tom Decker and VPG for this one -- deserving in every way of a much wider audience.

There is a place and a time for dice. Sadly, the designer didn't realize this.

In [i]Circus Train,[/i] your plans can be ruined by a lucky die roll from an opponent. Stealing performers is resolved with a roll of the die, regardless of how much cash players have available. Planning just feels mostly worthless. All of that would be forgivable if the game was short. But no, instead of the game being thirty minutes long, it is thirty minutes long [i]per player.[/i] That's called abuse.

Circus Train really captures its theme of struggling circus operators chasing the dollar, stealing from each other and treating their talent shabbily.  It's also nice to see Colloseum's concept of building a progressively more impressive show recycled in a better game.  The event cards are so amusing that it is a pity that more are not drawn.  

Luck is my problem with Circus Train.  Be lucky in the random distribution of talent, your die rolls to hire them and in high remuneration performances, and you will win.  I don't mind a hefty dose of luck in a filler, but Circus Train isn't a short game. I enjoy a laugh at my opponents' outrageous misfortune, but that isn't quite enough to keep this game in my collection.

Production quality is mixed.  The chunky counters and trains are quite nice and the cards are sturdy, but the jigsaw board fits together pretty loosely, with misaligned printing.  The rules are readable, but did leave us with questions.

As a euro-style gamer, this certainly isn't my cup of tea. The game has direct player conflict and tons of randomness; for one, the stealing of talent from other players is dictated by a single die-roll. Furthermore, event cards will randomly steel different types of talent and thus effect players differently. But the most influential random element is how the board refreshes; See, this game is very slow-moving and if the board refreshes in a favorable way (aka... shows nearby), a player could benefit greatly. 

But even if I ignored the random elements of this game, I find little to like about this game. Where most American-style game build tension and have fluid game-play, this game is clunky and made worst by certain random cards (rain can slow movement). For instance, it's not unusual to do nothing for several turns waiting to re-draw your entire hand. And while you can technically plan which card to play rounds ahead, the game is so tactical that such analysis is pointless. And to top it off, you have silly catch up mechanisms, obvious decisions, and an economic game that is more set-collection than anything else. The whole design feels uninspiring and dated.

This is my rating for the basic game. It sounded good with a strong theme but too much randomness. Very difficult to make strategic plans when you have no idea  where new tents will show up on the map or whether they will be performances or artists. Much too long for such a light game. Why are there so many rounds of scoring? This could have been streamlined immensely. I would be willing to try the advanced game with fewer than 5 players.

Fun hand management game where you manage a circus in the days of prohibition. Gather talent and perform at the various locations. I bought this for solo play and I only play it solo.
It is a really neat solo play game. You have a hand of action cards. Once a card is played you do not get it back until you play all your action cards. In the solo game you are only trying to make money. It is more simple than multiplayer play because you don't worry about victory points or reputation. It is streamlined, simple and better. You plan your hand how to make the most money by traveling around the map. Very nice puzzle to the solo game. I like it!

Players each manage a circus, travelling by rail around Prohibition era United States.  Very clever, engaging game, where players take turns to play an action card from their hand, and perform the action.  This involves moving their train piece across a point to point map of Canada and the United States.  Other cards allow the players to hire circus talent, perform a show, rest, and pay out the dreaded wages to your employees.  Performing increases your circus' reputation, and injects some income into your business.  At various points during the game, scoring takes place over a number of criteria, with another scoring round at the end of the game.

A very nice, thematic game.  The rules are a little fiddly, and take a bit of ingesting, especially when you try and backstitch the advanced/optional rules back into the base game for the full experience.  However, there is nothing particularly complex about the game, and offers some nice decision points for the gamer.  Managing the hand of action cards is very nice.  Interaction is high, as players swoop in and poach opportunities out from under the noses of other players.  

Underated game - deserves a much wider audience.  Fans of Colosseum should check this one out.

I like playing this one solo a lot.

After 4 plays I'm convinced I like it. I do find it hard to track what I'm doing and finding myself flipping through the rule book to verify things, but I think that will lesson as plays continue. That is mostly because I've played the Advanced and Optional combined rules. 

There's a lot of luck involved in the chit pulls, dice rolls for reputation, and random events that appear. How you play your hand of cards is where the tension and fun is at. In solo you make as much money as possible. The theme is really sweet.

mally a big fan of pick up and deliver games, but married with the clever hand management aspect it works really well. The game has just the right degree of player interaction and since it was originally designed for two it works especially well at this player count. There are a number of advanced and optional rules which add a bit more complexity and offer some extra control over recruitment. Scoring is a neat mix of prestige in the form of "best show" and a battle for set collection. Some will consider Circus Train to be an unholy mess of Eurogame and Ameritrash and much like a drunk high wire act the danger is that it fall in a sticky mess somewhere between the two. But, like the bearded lady, others may see this as a cool crossover as you build up your engine to score points whilst coping with unfair swings of fortune and stealing your opponent’s best acts all in a richly thematic setting.

Tense, very thematic, pretty unexplored and different theme, high player interaction, some randomness which provide fun, nice hand management ala Concordia/Historia with economic resource management, deciding the best moment to pay wages to your employees, while keeping your reputation as high as possible. 
Very original and high quality components also.
Highly recommended

Not that I am an expert, but I consider this my favourite pick up and deliver of those I've played.  It's got a great action selection mechanic held together with clever hand management, which drives the game well.  The scoring mechanism is also a clever mix between prestige in the form of "best show" and the actual victory points you are vying for.  Our first experience was a blast!

Great game. 

Designer did outstanding job of creating a narrative around this one. Easy to play. Lots of decisions. Some decent chrome. It's not a euro (this is good): it has soul, the random element and a nice screw your neighbor function. Not some boring and forgettable puzzle/worker optimization thing. Works very well with five players. Game survived the third week of play at the club; becoming a favorite there.

RATING: 8
A great game that conveys the theme really well. By theme I mean not just "Prohibition-era circus," but "fly by the seat of my pants, riding from town to town and trying to make this rag-tag show a success" (mixed metaphor and all :-). Really fun.

More detail: I picked this up mostly for the theme, which totally shines through. I've only played the advanced game, with 2, 3, and 5 players, and it's good at every count. The game is a mix of euro-style trying to balance how much talent you have with whether you'll be able to pay them, combined with some American-style steal-from-you/sabotage-your-plan elements (I really like the player interaction that this adds), and a good dose of chance from the random draws. The game has some fiddly rules, which I generally have a low tolerance for -- if you're planning to teach it, I really recommend solo-ing a half a game or so beforehand. But those rules really do match the theme. In the rulebook, the designer has some notes under a header that's something like "You Got Your Ameritrash in My Euro," and that's spot-on.

Update: This is one of those games that I like more than anyone else in my play group, so I haven't gotten it to the table since those initial 3 plays. I admit that the rules and pieces are both a bit fiddly; I thought the gameplay made up for that, they disagree.

RATING: 8.5
Basic game is really fun. Playing the advance game does not really make it a lot harder as there are a few new things but nothing too overwhelming. Only thing I was not really fond of was the reputation rules in the advanced game. The game seemed more fun with needing a 1-4 die roll to hire/steal talent. It just did not seem as fun starting with a 1-5 success roll and by the second turn of the game you could bump yourself up to a 1-6 and automatically be successful on all hire/steal attempts.

I had been eyeing Circus Train for some time, hearing good things on occasion, but always just keeping an eye open for a chance to play the game before trying to trade or buy a copy. I regret waiting so long. Circus Train is exactly the type of euro game that I thoroughly enjoy. The mechanics feel like something from 2004 when the best euros were being made. The rules could have been written a little better, and the board should have been mounted, but other than those small little nitpicks this game is outstanding. The game plays seamless and is always exciting. You get a since of accomplishment when you beat your previous best performance, and you definitely feel a little bit of push your luck as new demands are placed on the board. All in all this an outstanding game and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys streamlined euros.

Rating based on actual solitaire play combined with hopes for multiplayer play.  I'm not a big fan of solitaire games and I'm not sure this one delivers too much in that regard.  The random draws help make for decent replayability, but I am having trouble seeing multiple strategies.  It seems like just going with a skeleton crew to save on wages and maximizing the number of performances to take advantage of performance bonuses is the best way to earn.  I can't seem to make hiring additional talent really pay off given the loss of performances and the additional wages needed to be paid.

I look forward to multiplayer play, as that seems like it would shake things up quite a bit.  I wonder if solitaire rules might be benefitted by each turn replacing at least one local news counter.

I love the idea of this game and everything tends to work pretty well but you can really get wrecked if you spend a few turns fruitlessly trying to pick up performers from the board and you just can't get that die to land where you need it. Very cool but it would rank a lot higher for me if picking up acts wasn't so arbitrary.

Surprisingly fun. It communicates the theme really well in spite of fairly abstract mechanics. And while a read of the rules doesn't suggest much interaction, claiming artists and performances from under the noses of the other players is key, and hugely satisfying.

One of my most favorite of recent games. There is a nice screw your neighbor mechanic, which can result in wild swings of the leader, and it's hard to be sure who is really winning until the end. Combine that with a very nice use of theme, and this is a real winner. Not a generic euro, really more of an Ameritrash game, if one has to label it. It somehow reminds me of great games like Wiz-War and Pax Porfiriana, even though it's not too much like them at a surface glance. The components are really quite beautiful, too, although the cards are a little cheap (they are attractive, but not laminated, and seem flimsy - standard VPG cards, as far as I can tell. May want to sleeve them.). At least you don't have to shuffle them much. I think everyone who loves good multiplayer games should try this -- plays best with 4 or 5, IMO...the more player conflict there is, the better the game shines.

RATING: 1
To preface this review: I won by a substantial margin in my one (and hopefully only) play
... but much of this was largely due to avoiding, by sheer luck, the far-reaching, entirely upending, negative effects of the event cards. Another preface: one of my gaming buddies cannot stand Ginkgopolis and the lack of control that comes from the luck-dependent elements, which he sees as so pervasive and unmitigable that it leads to strategic void. I love Ginkgopolis. But it turns out I do have a line when it comes to determinism vs randomization -- and that line is somewhere between Ginkgopolis and Circus Train, because I felt that the latter left players way too much at the mercy of pure chaos, as the event cards can affect just about everything, rather than a balanced set of parameters. Truly a ghastly experience, as it also was overlong, featured event cards with ambiguous instructions (and no glossary of cards), and felt sloppy -- you could have the game end in 2 event card draws if both of them are stock market crash cards (the game ends immediately in such a case). Is this a joke? Who decided it was a good idea to cross We Didn't Playtest This At All with a 2 hour strategy game? In short, I am having lack of comprehension regarding how this game can have an average rating of 7.23, and how the top review can call this game fantastic and worthy of a Top 100 ranking. I love the title and the box art, and it's also on the rare (i.e., sold out) side, so I was looking forward to finally getting in a play. Woe betide me

---Preliminary thoughts---

A Euro game with cutthroat elements. It's all very thematic and make sense.

It's a pick and deliver version of Colosseum, with action selection.

The quality of the components is somewhat lacking.

There are also some rules that don't convince me (the cutthroat aspect, the initial rounds seem too unimportant, it doesn't seem to very easy to plan ahead, because some tiles are hiding??).

Needs playtime!

Comment: Rules are rather simple, but there are a few rough edges. After a few games, all the rules will settle in, but the first few plays you'll tend to forget a rule here and there. Most of the information is on the board, which helps, but a few things are kind of tucked away in the rulebook. Game turns are rather quick and you don't have TOO many decisions to make each round. The game can be incredibly cut throat depending on player count and the group. Components are mostly nice, although the board I got says it's a "Demo Copy Only". Not sure what the deal is with that...

Optimal Player Count: 4 > 5 > 3 > 2 > 1
Plays well with all player counts, but mostly the more the better.

Something of a Euro/AT hybrid, with obvious (and acknowledged) influence from Kramer's Colosseum, but with a map, post-decision dice-rolling and (optional) event cards. The theme (travelling circuses in Prohibition-era America) is delightful and the components mostly good but with some irritatingly small text on the important show tokens.

August 2013:  Allen and I played a print-n-play copy at a Gen Con event and thought it was decent.  Not crazy about who we played it with, so not a fair play to judge.

The deluxe version certainly upgrades the components from the smaller first edition map and cardboard chits.  Good eyesight still needed to read the small print on the local news counters, but much of the information in the game is open so no problem discussing things as one plays the game.

I have played the basic game and look forward to adding in the advanced rules (reputation, replaying cards, pocketing wages) to add another facet to one's turns and tactics.  

The optional event cards will work with both versions.  For the higher player counts, certainly worth adding in the optional special talent to help add more counters for the local news draws to minimize running out before the season changes.

RATING: 5
This is what you get when a wargamer designs a eurogame and doesn't really get what makes eurogames tick.  Too many important random rolls to determine whether you hire talent.  Random draws to determine where to take your show so you can't plan ahead.

Played with 5, which is probably too many.  (Probably better with fewer.)  the fifth player too often has no choice after the first four take their turns each round.

The real gripe is the game balancing mechanism is badly designed.  They use common technique of rotating the start player--but they only do so at every month (i.e. 4-5 turns.)  The problem is the fifth at the crucial start of the game and fourth in the next month, with all of the attractive options gone before he even gets his turn.  He usually can't recruit an act and build up his circus & ends up hopelessly behind that even getting first late in the game won't make up for.

If it rotated every turn--simple change--would probably work better.

Starting to become a relatively frequent mid-length game. Enjoyable but the two player rules need a little tweaking.

Interesting theme and gameplay. But frustrating when actions go unfulfilled, and components are quite small.

Next time I'd like to play without all the rules mistakes, and add the random events.  Nice game, though.

Circus Train is an extremely difficult game for me to rate. On the one hand, I want to give it lots of bonus points for feeling fresh and integrating theme so deliciously, richly into the game. On the other hand, the cost to the game play for that theme integration is high.

Circus Train, inspired by the massive hit novel, "Water for Elephants" is thematically about prohibition era circuses traveling around the United States. As a circus owner you have to manage your payroll, hire freaks, acrobats, horses, big cats, elephants and human cannonballs (7 types total) and hit the rails to perform shows based upon demand for specific acts. The entire affair is managed with the card mechanic seen most recently in Mac Gerdts' Concordia: each player has an identical set of cards / one card played per round / cards returned to hand when all cards have been played.* The essence of the game is managing your 9 card actions (8 in the basic game) efficiently to get the stuff you need for a pretty straight forward pick-up-and-deliver system.

Here is where the game shines: it is just downright fun to build a circus, put on shows, and to have witty, joyful, thematic comments bloom from the shared playing experience at the table. Jokes about roaming big cats abandoned in Des Moines... a funny double entendre about the world famous clowns of Chicago... narrative explorations of the benefits of pinheads versus fat ladies in the freak lineup, make the 2 and half hours of game time a great way to spend time with witty people you like to hang out with.

As a design, the game does pull its weight in crafting shared narratives, but here is where the game fails: as an exercise in tactical and strategic thinking-- in the foundational way in which you are prompted to out-think your opponents-- the game is wholly lackluster.

In Concordia, the hand management task is made exponentially more interesting by the singular change of allowing each player decide when to return the discards back into play. In Concordia, the cost for this is in efficiency and tempo. In Circus Train, with one possible way of playing a single discard one extra time (an action with an exceptionally high, difficult to justify cost) you will play through the whole hand before getting your used cards back. This has the unfortunate consequence of reducing the strategic space as the cards-in-hand shrinks. In fact, in the last round, the last three or four actions for each player are quite scripted and very anti-climatic.

Further undermining the decision space and the game-tension is a too-loose game economy. In the early game, paying for your talent is tricky as money is tight, but in an unfortunate design choice (imho), the player's money accumulation accelerates ($5 to $15 in the early game, escalating to $20 to $30 in the late game) without a commensurate escalation in overhead. This means that by the end of the game all the players are flush with money, taking away one of the tense and wonderful challenges of the early game: having tough choices between building your circus for the long term or performing for cash now.

In the design notes, Mr. Decker discusses his aspirations to (more coming,...)

Good, Colosseum-like game of putting on the best performances as travelling circuses. Replaces Collosseum's trading and circling nobles with spatial movement.

The end of season, player in last place steals any act from another player seems a bit dodgy - should probably be restricted to not stealing a player's only act of a type and optionally taken from the bank instead.

Very quirky game about traveling circus troupes competing for performance opportunities and talent while making money and out-performing one another.  The map consists of rail routes that span the Eastern half of the U.S. and Canadian border.  The map is deceptively tricky with little direct passage anywhere and can leave a circus in some backwater without any nearby opportunities.  All players start with the same hand of nine cards, but to accomplish anything one must plot their card plays ahead a turn or more.  Even misplaying just a single card can completely derail plans.  Unfortunately, this can lead to newish players needing a great deal of time to make their move.  And even the best laid plans can be sabotaged by fate or a predatory circus operator.  I suspect it shines best when played cut-throat which requires the right crowd and a thick skin.  The game pieces are artfully thematic and robust.  However, the tiny numbers printed on the circus tents would lead one to believe it was a flea circus.  Good game that I look forward to playing more.

A fun cross between pick up and deliver and Colosseum.

This game is screaming out for a high quality Ludofact publication.

This is not a railroad game. Point to point movement game during the Prohibition period.  Race on your circus train from town to town around the Midwest to pick up the best and most talent (or steal from other circus trains) and put on the most popular shows with alcohol. Increasing your reputation gives you card action advantages.  Each player has a set of action cards. the trick of the game is managing high costs for the big attractions while making payroll for your performers or save their wage and push them off the train. The game board art is inviting to play.

Take on the risks of running a Depression-era circus, complete with promising to pay your performers when you probably can't follow through….  There's something about this that has me hooked.  I think it's the solid thematic saturation into the mechanisms of the game.  In most games, I'd be incredibly annoyed if I arrived at a place demanding something just in time for them to change their mind, but it makes sense on the rare occasion that it happens in [b]Circus Train[/b]: You got a postcard telling you, "Hey, we want a circus to come to town!  With tigers and acrobats and clowns!" but by the time you eventually get there, they're hungry for clowns, elephants, and a human cannonball.  …or perhaps you arrive to find the unemployed remains of a bankrupt circus that got there before you.

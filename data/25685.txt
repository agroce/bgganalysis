Blackbeard (I have the newer GMT edition) is a highly thematic game, you pick up a number of pirates and try to make a lot of money by stealing cargo, destroying ports, abducting people for ransom, (sometimes torturing them to gain secrets), definitely not your average family game due to healthy doses of simulation of what pirate life used to be all about. The components are incredibly well done, the game may be a bit long but there is a lot of variety and story and it is fully engrossing throughout. There are also all sorts of navy from different countries that are trying to get you, including mercenaries (that could well be sent to get you by other pirates) and most of these battles usually end in tears but even though at times you appear to be almighty it will only take a bad weather card, or a counter card from an opponent to ruin your day. I don't think there are many other pirate games out there that give a real flavour of pirate life but also are very enjoyable to play.

RATING: 4.5
Fun and true to the original but disappointing. The cards in particular are poorly worded and too many require reference to the rules. I really wish the goods could have been goods rather than just values, it misses out on so much flavour.

Not as good as the original, which is a shame. Merchants and Marauders is a much better implementation of a similar idea, but I wish it was solo.

Best pirate game Ive played.  Definately a heavy luck component but it integrates well with the theme and is partly mitigated by allowing you to control multiple pirates simultaneously.  Suprisingly the careers of in game pirates hold pretty true to history with many meeting their end by natural disaster or the authorities after a few good raids.

RATING: N/A
This game is dripping with theme and fun.  It is not difficult to play and flows rather well.  High player interaction.  The components are good, but would be excellent if the functionality was a bit better.  The artwork is fantastic.  The game has thick glossy cards which are durable.  However, the game board is unmounted cardstock. The spaces for Hostages and the Letter of Marquee on the Pirate Display cards could be laid out better; however, this is a minor issue.  The rulebook was difficult to get through and could have been better written.  The Living Rules clear up just about all the rules problems.

I loved the original, felt that this version although it improved on pirates to choose, and some of the game pieces, lacks the tension of the original.. Also missed the chance to expand on the pirate geography of the game and correct some of the poor choice of ports in the Indian ocean, would love to have seen the inclusion of the Brazil coast (Roberts hunting ground) and the challenge of the pacific with the juan fernandez islands and the spanish dominated Chile, Peruvian and Mexican coast- the prize... the Manilla galleons!   I always remember reading the General with that immortal comment line "Drop anchor and raid Campeche"!

RATING: 4
A simulation of the Golden Age of piracy. Lots of randomness, "take-that", and theme. Probably too much randomness and take-that for my taste. As much or more energy can seem to go into thwarting opponents than doing your own stuff. You also aim to retire pirates when they've done well and then start again from scratch, so all-round there isn't a feeling of ongoing progression. That said, with a larger group than my 2p play, playing for laughs and camaraderie I think there could be enough of a game here to warrant a play. But I think I'd always rather play something else. Also lots of holes in the rules, ambiguities, and despite using revised rules, plenty of references to chits, holding boxes etc. which don't exist.

"Richard Berg has now taken the original and redesigned it, almost entirely, to bring it into line with what gamers like to see and play these days." Not this gamer I'm afraid. 
Virtually every aspect of Blackbeard is determined by luck, not just dice rolls, but card draws, tile flips - the lot. The only meaningful decision I felt I made in 2.5 hours was to agree to sit down at the table where this was about to be played. 
I don't avoid games with luck at all, but I just felt it was impossible to factor it into the gameplay in this one, and for me, being able to do that is what makes a game a game.
I didn't hate Blackbeard, but it is unlikely I'd ever play again due to the length, the significant lack of control and the fact it's possible to win by doing almost nothing except successfully defend your ships when attacked - not very piratey that, shipmates.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Would have put this at a 3, but after playing it a second time I knocked it a point down, as I am now certain I'll be skipping it next time it comes to the table.

The game is thick in theme and historical content, but the gameplay is lacklustre. Every player is on a race of victory points, with next to no player interaction, except being allowed to play disruptive event cards during another player's turn. Since all event cards only have low action values from 1-3, this is just another stick in the wheel to a game where not much happens.

The event deck might be a sinner here. The card values firstly don't allow for a lot of action in a player's turn, but more importantly the events are just boring. It feels like half the deck is just 'add governor' cards and the rest are just somewhat useful abilities you rarely want to spend for anything other than points anyway. Compare this with the event deck of another Richard Berg design, Genesis, where there are cards adding enemy tribes, cards that execute potentially devastating deity-events, a leader assassination card that, once in play, puts every king on the board in jeopardy, even the card holder. Blackbeard has no events as crazy and consequential as these.

Some of my fellow players seem to enjoy aspects of it, partly some of the hit tables and pirate-y possible outcomes, like being able to ravage a governor's daughter. I suspect they find some aspects that are enjoyable, in the same way that trashy films can be. In my experience, there was little to break the monotony in Blackbeard - perhaps appropriately, it feels more like being stowed on a ship for ages than a swift, swashbuckling sensation.

Initial rating based on one solitaire play that was more to teach me how to play the game than anything else.  I think as I play a few more solitaire games, I will remember the various actions and conditions and will likely appreciate this game anew.  

(6/16/08) Played first two-player game tonight--much different than the few solitaire efforts I have made.  We did not utilize the anti-pirate actions very often, nor warships or king's commissioners. I do think I have a better grasp on the game now.  I want to play one or two more times before adjusting my rating.

RATING: 5
You've got to be comfortable with a lot of luck, and enjoy the journey.  If you play infrequently, it will seem like you are spending a lot of time figuring out which chart to use.  I play with 5 players and the end comes fast.  I think that with 5 it is much too strong on the 'take that!' aspect, and it overwhelmed your ability to plan.  This should be reduced with 3 or 4 players.  Also seems to go on a little too long with 5.  Unfortunately 5 is the only way this seems to get to the table.  I would really like to try this 3 player.  Dropped to a 6 after repeated 5 player play, because I don't want to do that yet again.

A reference pirate simulation game. The newer merchants and marauders borrowed much from the main gameplay structure. The manual is written as in all simulation games. Very difficult to hold in all the info on the first pass, and there isn't any easier walkthrough. However the game itself is not that complex at all. I could call it a serious family game that lasts very long. It is a good pirate game that has lots of stuff to do, but misses something overly exciting mechanics-wise. I enjoyed the game. Would I prefer merchants and marauders? well if you're not a dedicated simulation fan, maybe. My choice is to wait around for an even more complex pirate game.

A good looking pirate simulation that, perhaps true to its theme, is quite chaotic. Although I had many laughs while playing, this is not a game I would want to play more than 2-3 times in a year. Because it tries to be a simulation it has many rules that do not however add depth to the game. It is fun because you do feel like a pirate in dangerous waters. It is extremely difficult to be a successful pirate and retire!

Well, I had high hopes for Blackbeard. I like the game quite a bit, but not as much as I thought I would. Some mechanics (sacking a port, hostages) seem fiddly just for the sake of being fiddly. I think of Blackbeard more of a simulation than a game, actually. The solo game was quite fun and I think this will be the only way I will play going forward.

An unfortunate disappointment for me.  I was really looking forward to this.  The game takes an incredible amount of time to basically (1) plunder some booty, (2) try to get back to port, and (3) convert the booty.  Due to constant Anti-pirate actions being played on you every step of the way, it took the entire course of the game for me to complete those three steps with just one captain.  Then the game was over.  Since I happened to be the one who got lucky with the booty roll, I won the game; basically all due to luck.  My group has played twice more with the same impressions.

Played this with 7 during my first experience. Consensus was that 7 is too many. Better with 5. I'm sure we made many rules blunders (we replaced far too many governors)and it was tedious rechecking rules, modifiers, etc. but I know tha goes away as experience grows. Don't yet have a handle on a good strategy but this is a good game. Needs to be played a few times and I think appreciation will grow.

Only managed to play 2 player up to now. Game is very luck driven (which is probably realistic but can also be very frustrating). Also in my opinion there are to many VP´s for notoriety. More players might help.
Compared to the original Blackbeard it´s probably the better game. While the new version can still be quite frustrating it´s a lot less so than the original.

I remember playing the original AH game as a kid, but not much else about it. What drew me to Blackbeard was the fantastic cover art and of course the theme! The later comes out very well. You can perform most of the typical pirate actions you can think of :)
There are many charts to follow which I like, a luck factor which is very manageable and a heavy "take that" aspect in the game that leaves me with mixed feelings.
You don't get to impersonate a single famous pirate but to manage a bunch of them. This detracts from the game a bit from an "rpg-light" standpoint but it works.
The solo rules are nice plus you only control a single pirate (Blackbeard) for the solo game, which is more close to my tastes.
The addition of historical facts on the pirates, real ports, KC and governor names, very thematic artwork and color choices, all add to the feeling of immersion into the Golden age of Piracy.  
ps. I own the second printing of the game which has revised rules (the "living rules" available for printing on the GMT's web page) and slightly remade graphics on the board, which by the way is not mounted!

I'd been thinking about this one for a while, and finally picked it up used on EBay for about $20.  Wasn't too sure of my purchase, as it seems much maligned on the 'geek, but I wanted a pirate game, and it seemed like simulation was the way to go over a Euro (plus wanted something that would play with 2).  I played a lot of Pirates as a kid on the PC, so I wanted a game that came close to that experience, and while this is of course not quite there (a bit too fiddly), it does a reasonable job. It's not hard to learn, just hard to remember all the details of procedure.  I like the card driven action mechanism, though. Recommended, but only if you have time and patience.

Right now there are so many pirate games in the pipeline! The new Blackbeard looks however as being the most likely game to scratch the pirate game itch I've felt ever since playing the oldie Buccaneer as a child and which has yet to be satisfied.

Too bad that GMT Games has with this game and WoP two competing games in its portfolio, thus making WoP's life yet tougher. A largely wargamer customer base is bound to be more attracted to Berg's new Blackbeard. Furthermore, it helps that this design's preliminary graphics are of such quality, whereas WoP's sneakpeek graphics (I'm not talking of the playtest graphics, but the artwork study) leaves at least me cold.

The game is very well themed and plays very similar to some of the great computer pirate games, but it comes up short in game play. You are required to constantly harass and peck at other players or you will lose. Nothing I like better in a game than confrontation, but it gets to a point that it just makes people mad when every time they try to do something you are preventing them. The confrontation is more frustrating and at the end of three or four hours you are just glad to be done playing. I'd love the game if the mechanics where fixed, but as is it would take a lot to make me play it again.

There's just an awful lot of dice rolling and fiddly chit pushing for what goes on -- and somehow that seems less acceptable to me in this genre than in a wargame.  Illogical, perhaps, but that's how I feel.

Criticism seems based on two issues; 1]  Rules are poorly done and 2]  It is a re-image, not a reprint of the AH game.  My replies...1]  It is a Berg game, what did you expect.  His games have generated more errata than Scrooge McDuck has coins in hsi money pile.  2]  Apples and Oranges.  The AH is a classic, but had a steep learning curve.  When you 'got it', great, but even then it was fiddly.  I'll never part with my AH version because of some great memories, but the GMT one is what will hit the table and be taught new gamers.

Played only one game so far and by the end was completely underwhelmed. I am willing to try it again, but (I can't believe I am saying this) way too much randomness. I also felt there was way too much "Take That!" style of card play. While I do like a game that has screwage in it, I think there could have been a little less and maybe something a little more innovative. 

After 2 or 3 shots of cheap rum, this game might rate a 6. Yo, ho, whatever...

Blackbeard is essentially an adventure game with all the associated randomness but sports a heavy ruleset fit for a wargame. This is puzzling: did the designers really think that this would work? Of course, it does not. The problem is not how the rules are written - the clarity of the 2008 reprint rules is above average - but in the complexity of the rules, which slows the game down and sucks most of the fun out of the adventuring experience. The complexity does not serve any useful purpose as far as I can see. Why cant you ransom prisoners at Portugese ports? Why do you need a complex system for determining how many actions you have instead something simple such as: two actions + (potentially) events from cards? Are the rules for pirate alliance really necessary? The designers hint that one design goal was to create a simulation. Really? What design goal is this? In any case, several aspects of the game are very far from simulation. Take, for instance, the event that states that all your pirates become seasick, never mind that one of them is at New York port and others are sailing near Africa. Realistic, huh? This and several other events are bad for another reason: they deny actions instead of providing opportunities and interesting choices. How much fun is to skip your turn? To sum up, it seems that designers have made a great effort but the result is ... crap. Nice components, though (for a GMT game).

P.S. Merchants & Marauders is certainly much better game. Oh, and forget about playing the game solo. It is much worse than multiplayer. Not that you can get much worse from rating 3.

This will be my first P500 game. It took a pirate game to get me to pre-order anything. ;)

May 8, 2008 -- It arrived today. :D

May 24, 2008 -- My first play was last night. It was a three-player game that took four hours. We made a lot of rules mistakes and strategic/tactical errors, but I think a second play would be much smoother and take much less time. 7/10

GMT Blackbeard is an interesting game.  The short version doesn't allow for enough game development but is okay for teaching purposes.  The long game is preferred and the nuances of game flow and rules referencing does take it's toll.  Once one gets the system down, Blackbeard plays rather well. Having the British ships at +2 makes the game more interesting and realistic in my opinion - I mean how many pirates took on British warships back in the day?  Do you press your luck for one more merchant ship or raid that port or retire to a pirate's paradise?  The historical pirates and locations/islands around the world make the game interesting.  The player interaction with the cards also adds an interesting dimension to game play.

This is my favorite theme, but even after making my own custom player mats and writing rules summary cards, the game has a Streep learning curve that requires players be familiar with the game to get a good play in.

Our group tried the short version, 1 round of card play.  We didn't get the 2nd ship into much action, think you must play the longer version to more balance the game. Our winner got lucky on a loot roll then get into port and retired quickly before the Pardon card came up and ended the game.  Not very satisfying.  Was hoping for much more.

Such a great missed opportunity for a brilliant pirate historical simulation. Just too many rules ambiguities makes coming up with house rules and interpretations too frustrating and more effort than I care to devote to a game. And this is AFTER the living rules fixes. Needed more playtest and development. 

Too much work to try to make sense of the King's Commissioner rules. I'd play Merchants & Marauders over this any time.

Berg + Randall + GMT = game kit.  Dspite the fact that they are on the second iteration of the rules for this game, there are still errors.  While I do enjoy luck in a game, the amount of luck present here does not fit well with the length and complexity of the game system.  While it may be historically accurate, it doesn't mean it is fun.  I feel there needs to be some limit on the number of pirates one can play as over the course of the game, as there was in the first.  There are some other things that just don't make sense.  For example, you can attempt to gain a safe-haven at a pro-pirate port, where you can retire as your next action, for 100-600 gold.  If you want to just attempt to retire at that same pro-pirate port (without first making it your safe-haven) it will cost you between 1100-6600 gold.  I feel that the game also loses a lot when removed from the hex grid, as you no longer really have to travel anywhere, and the speed of the ships is seldom, if ever used.

I left this game at someone else's house, 1600 miles away from mine, and I don't really care if I ever get it back.

Trying rate in the spirit of the rating descriptions is sometimes tough.  Will I ever play this again?  No I won't.  There are far too many other games available that will be on the table with my group.  But I don't want to give it a '2'.  Though that's the rating that fits I find it insulting given the work that obviously has gone into the game.  I didn't _hate_ it nor do I think it's fundamentally broken considering the type of game I believe it's trying to be.  Randomness or chaos (perhaps both are involved in this game) are not issues for me.  There are many games with strong components of both that I love to play.  Primary player interaction is blasting your opponent with bad cards (becomes expected every time you start your turn) or chasing them down with a KC.  Those things aren't really what bothered me all that much.  What it comes down to for me is the time investment.  I know there are some folks who'll love this game.  They'll invest the time to work out ambiguities in the rules and commit all the die & action tables to memory.  Perhaps once achieving that downtime will not be a significant factor and they'll be able to play the game in 3hrs as rated.  There are few games I'll put that much into and I guess that says a lot about me. ;)  It just isn't the game for me.

A nice idea wrecked by an overabundance of charts and an oversized, and sometimes ambiguous, set of rules. The upshot is that the game just does not flow well because of the constant chart and rules referencing. This will get better with repeated game play, but only if you play regularly.

Frankly, the game needs to be reworked and slimmed down, and probably turned over to a different designer (or perhaps [i]Merchants & Marauders[/i] is that game already). Berg really tends to fall down once he gets out of his comfort zone, i.e. tactical or operational level wargames. The whole bit with recording hostage information for individual pirates on individual ports is so overwrought it's absurd. All of the "take that" in the game makes it difficult to accomplish anything. As it stands now, the best thing to do is take the fastest ship possible, take one load into port and retire. You won't survive to load up the larger ships.

GMT gets some blame here, too, for not providing better player aids and the fact that some cards have restrictions that aren't listed anywhere but in the rulebook, where they should have been printed on the card itself.

Ultimately, I suspect most people want [i]Merchants & Marauders[/i].

Ken B.'s comment that "Blackbeard is the game that just kind of happens to you" is a fair one. I still dig it quite a bit, but it could *really* use an expansion deck or at least some variant cards to spice things up and reduce some of the repetition. However, it's a dramatic improvement over some of the more tedious simulation aspects of the original. The best assessment I can make of it is that it is stuck in a somewhat uncomfortable spot somewhere between simulation and game...

RATING: 3
Players take pirate actions to increase their net worth (via booty) and notoriety (by doing pirate things).  Players take turns to play cards as actions/events to do pirate stuff - take merchants, attack ports, etc.  Eventually a pirate will ideally retire and bank the victory points, otherwise it's a grisly end and banking fewer victory points.  Beautiful game, although the pieces tend to blend into the game board, making it difficult to assess the current game situation - we quickly got tired of trying to find the merchants every turn, and just kept a mental tally.  Coming as we did from the Avalon Hill edition, we were all was quite bored and disappointed by the downtime between turns.  The rapid game play has been replaced by ponderous "take that" anti pirate actions.  The rules have several holes in them, and the game is way too easy on the pirates.  It's rare for a merchant to elude capture, or a port fail to fall to an attack.  Warships and KC's are brushed aside, and sought after for the notoriety.  So, take out the pace, agony and tension of the original, and replace with "take that" card play - the last bastion of lazy design.  Played four times now and likely won't play it again - not for us.

finally got to play this.  THIS IS AN ADVENTURE STYLE GAME!!  Those wanting a war or euro style will be let down.  This actually has more in common with adventure fantasy style.

Excellent adventure game!

I never played the original version. Interesting topic. The game play feels a bit experimental and there is a lot of record taking, information tracking, and a high degree of luck--probably a tad too much of all these for the game to be my personal cup o' tea. That said, I do respect the game as I think it achieves the aim of pirate career sim (minus the Hollywood glamour and far-fetched swashbuckling of dime store novels). 

The artwork for the 2008 edition is drop dead gorgeous and perfectly evokes the period and subject matter. Mark has done a brilliant job in this regard. I do wish some of the counters had a bit more contrast in terms of background color-- everything has an ivory/beige background which occasionally makes it take longer than it should to locate a particular counter or marker. And there are a lot of different counter and marker types. But this is a very minor gripe. I'd give the artwork a near-perfect score.

I must also give kudos to Richard Berg for including a brief career synopsis of each of the pirates included in the game. This was a very welcome touch that really helped cement the theme and pull me into the game.

Want to know what fiddly means? Play this game. But this is a strange one. I would rather call this a collective pirate story experience than a game. As a competitive game for victory points it is pretty meaningless; you don't have much control over your pirates, getting victory points is often a matter of luck, rules are extremely fiddly, a lot of randomness, dice rolling and charts. But if you can digest the rules, pretty much ignore the victory points and concentrate on having fun with the events unfolding Blackbeard  can turn out to be a quite nice story-telling game where pirates come and go and fortunes can and will dramatically change. 

A good reference sheet for the main rules would make this game much easier to play. The rules are DIFFICULT to digest, but the play-experience is getting better as the rules are becoming more familiar.

Still at the moment I can't ignore the feeling that this could work better as a computer simulation where you just clicked "Start" and watched the story to unfold. Time will tell.

The old game was perhaps flawed, but a relatively interesting simulation. The new version attempts to be more of a "family game", but fails miserably. The complicated procedurals to achieve various things have stayed, the luck factor has even been upped a bit, but the atmosphere of the simulation has vanished completely. Basically one just plays the same event cards against each other over and over again. It feels like "Kill Dr. Lucky" in the Caribbean: "I move to attack this merchant" "No, you don't, because I play ....against you", and so on, ad nauseam.
A very disappointing new version - it would have been better to remove the botched turn order system of the old game and leave the rest as it was. Even the old map was nicer and more interesting to move upon!

I have read some ambiguous rule books in my time, but the rule book in this takes the p**s. It is ridiculously unclear, littered with spelling mistakes and examples jump from page to page explaining concepts the rule book has yet to touch. This is certainly the WORST rulebook I have ever encountered and it was a real chore to get through. Thank goodness for the geek and somebody producing a 'living rule book' version which helps to clarify a lot of the concepts here.

Stop-start gameplay, with player turns varying greatly in length, there is very little swordplay, cannon fire and plunder and it doesn't really have much of a pirate-y feel to it. The theme is undeniably there but it just doesn't feel quite right. There is also the issue that you can sit outside port, loot the ports merchant ship  then sail into the port ransom the merchant and goods you stole... and the Governor/Nation you just stole from couldn't care less!

We were scrabbling over 20-30 VP each when the general pardon card came up ... one player managed to loot a second ship in the Indian ocean, maximising his booty, and his notoriety and then sail into port for the full pardon and over 100 VP... didn't seem worth continuing at that point. 

I am glad I played... but I would never want to again.

Tentative rating. Seems good, nice if not real tough decisions to make. Having a different theme doesn't hurt. Isn't it a bit too long for what it brings?

This game complements the original version, not replaces it.  It depends on your mood for playing.

All I will say is that there are die rolls that could be the difference between scoring 40-50 points or not. When 25% of your score could come down to a single die roll, something is wrong with the design.

There is much to like about Blackbeard. But make sure you treat it as a storylike gaming experience, rather than a strategic battle.

A friend of mine picked this game up after we played my game (the original game from Avalon Hill).  This game might be "more realistic" as to what a pirate had to undergo during the time, but it loses ALL of the flavor from the original game.  You don't get to feel like a pirate anymore.  Instead, taking a merchant ship is underwhelming, and the misery you experience going against warships and in the normal day-to-day operation of your pirate ship, makes this game a definite "not likely to ever play again".  In fact, my friend was so unimpressed with this version, he sold it.

I got this in a trade knowing full well how involved and difficult the rules are... saying to myself, "I'm going to commit to learning them."  Yeah, right...  Every time I started into the rules my eyes glazed over and my brain hurt and I thought, gee, it just isn't worth the effort.  So anyway, I won't rate the game or comment on how it plays... but I have to laugh when I've seen this advertised as a "family game".  I guess it depends on the family, but that would not remotely be my description for this type of game.

I've only read the rules and a few reviews, but it certainly seems that it has exactly the same flaws (terrible randomness and few meaningful strategic decisions) of the AH classic but.

Unfortunately, all the thematic charm seems to be missing here.

I'm not sure what was GMT's intention with this game. Compared to the old one, the new is simply not good. They took away some of the best aspects of the game, f.e.: SAILING which is a huge disappointment for me. I feel like they tried to make a more simple game but they ended up with an even more confusing one. The amazing ship cards are not here either although we get some very well made event cards and a new system for them (this one is welcome). I would give it a 6 if the old one werent one of my favorite board game ever.

Graficamente notable, aunque con tablero de cartulina. Temática atrayente y muy bien llevada, con gran variedad de acciones disponibles muy en linea con el juego de PC de sid meyer, y factor puteo importante.

Pero... demasiadas tablas, gran cantidad de mecanicas deslabazadas que dificultan su asimilación, ayudas de juego definicientes (la no-oficial del señor Doyle es una maravilla, eso si), juego poco fluido a causa de la necesidad de consulta constante una y otra vez. No se puede improvisar una partida, hay que estudiar las reglas antes de cada sesión. La redacción de las reglas no es mala, pero tampoco ayuda. 
Y por último, el hecho de que no se pueda atacar directamente a otros piratas (aunque con las acciones anti-pirata ya hay bastante), hace que al final solo respondas a la generación aleatoria de barcos mercantes.

A pirate game with a very strong pirate feel and a relatively good level of fidelity (i.e., lots of spots on the map to be, lots of characteristics of your pirate captains, variable ship abilities).

Just played a learning game to play test the rules (which was useful since no one had played the new GMT version).

The jury is still out on an overall assessment of the game, but I would gladly try this one again.

Don't get too attached to any particular pirate. The object of the game is to score points by successfully playing a succession of pirates. Once a particular pirate has cashed in his booty a couple times, it's time to retire him before notoriety becomes too much of a liability. Once you get used to that idea, it's a great game. By wargame standards, Blackbeard isn't that hard, but some might find it a little too detailed for a game about pirates. Efforts have been made to make it historical. I personally enjoy it, and it's one of the few games I own that's perfect for three players.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (December 2012)

To be perfectly honest, I don’t remember much about the game.  I remember I thought many components were very similar between them making it hard to differentiate them quickly.

In theory the game is great, you can torture prisoners :evil:, however in practice I found the game a bit tedious and with lots of luck and “take that” moments. I no longer enjoy this kind of game. I also dislike the theme.

I will play again to properly rate and comment, however I don’t have much hope for the game. It is very likely its rating will go down with more plays. 

Current Rating: 4.0

RATING: 5
Sort of depressing. I'm sure the score reflects the sense of excitement I had for this game and then the letdown.  Its not a bad game but it could be so much more.  The skeleton of a rich historical pirate game is there but it devolves into a take-that card game.  On top of that, there is alot of bookkeeping which is largely unneeded.  As is, it screams for a computer automated accounting system.  As its not computerized, the game would really benefit from some sort of token system to show accrued glory, value of loot, etc.  I would be tempted to patch it but the overriding play isn't really exciting enough to do so.  The solitaire version is meh.

RATING: 6
A serious treatment of the piracy theme, this game stands out as a contrast to all the crappy pirate games flooding the marketplace.  The complex attributes of each pirate and his crew are welcome and reminiscent of the senators in Republic of Rome.  This character development alone is enough to make Blackbeard a game that, at a minimum, I'm willing and happy to play again.  Blackbeard has the same narrative potential that Republic of Rome, Magic Realm, and Tales of the Arabian Nights have, with grand stories of the glorious careers of the few pirates who retire well set against the stark relief of the majority of pirates who die or fail.  The difficulty of pirate actions is not an issue given that the goal is simulation.  I want it to be special when a pirate succeeds.

The main negative for me was that there is way too much take-that, and I'm not sure fewer players would actually fix the issue.  The real problem with the anti-pirate actions is that they break theme, and theme is critical in this genre.  Wait, you mean I'm a "pirate player" and I'm controlling British warships?  Why do I care whether other pirates are screwed over as long as I get mine?  The anti-pirate functions would really be better off removed from player control, or if take-that is still seen as desirable, moved into the hands of one dedicated anti-pirate player.

There were also too many turns when I felt like my pirates weren't doing anything useful, then had to wait 10 minutes for the other players to actually do useful things before finally getting to make more interesting decisions.  (Screwing over other players, with the exception of using the King's Commissioners, wasn't a type of decision I found interesting.)  This is one area where fewer players would help.

I would like to play this game again, with 3 or 4 so as to get more frequent turns and less screwage.  I don't want this game to fall under "unrealized potential" for me, but I sense it's destined to become a game I play solitaire in order to build stories without some of the more irritating game mechanics.

The interaction is great.  There is certainly a learning curve, but by end of game we were moving pretty quickly.  The Anti-pirate actions are a HUGE plus in this game.  Some randomness in the cards - which is a great thing.  The newly released Official Clarifications and Q&A really help with some of those hard to answer questions too.  After three plays, there doesn't seem to be enough available Pirate Actions.  Anytime you get some steam, the Anti-Pirates coll you off.  A little too much time and effort for the reward, in my opinion.

Components look beautiful.  A real step up from previous GMT games I have.  Counters just seem of higher quality than, say, Conquest of Paradise, and the cards are wonderfully thick.  The art is also awesome.  Shame about the off-centre counter printing, and the numerous rule book typos.  Looking forward to seeing how it plays.

UPDATE: Played once so far with wife.  The game is quite complex and I spent most of the time looking in the rules.  Fortunately, most things are easy to find.  I can't see it hitting the table very often since it will be just too complex for my gaming friends.  I was hoping for something just a little more complex than a 'heavy' Euro, but actually it's in a different league to games like Caylus and PR. Very disappointed with the errors in production: 'Soth America'?!  Rules questions on BGG and CSW have also indicated that it's worth waiting for all the errata before playing again; considering trade.

Blackbeard, fiddlyness be thy name! The game plays like the rules read: "Each player now completes a player-turn (4.3), in the order determined in Step 2. Repeat Step 11 until the Game Length (4.1) is reached. At that point, determine the Winner (18.0)." I knew before that this will be an experience game and not one of great strategies being rewarded or tense decisionmaking. But the experience was severly hampered by the fiddlyness of gameplay.

Too bad as the components are gorgeous. Hopes for getting that nostalgic Pirates PC game feeling weren't fulfilled. For the three to four hours this might take with half-experienced players, there is too much randomness and not enough game or fun in it. What use playing for so long when the game is decided in booty rolls and who's lucky enough that none of his opponents has the right take-that card in his hands before retirement or any other important action.

RATING: 1
I think the game is unreal:
1- Pirates want to be attacked by Warships to get notoriety points when they used to flee ---> It's so easy!!
2- Ports are easy to attack, sack and destroy. Except very strongs ports like NY ---> Your pirate doesn't live long enough to attack that ports.
3- Pirates live a short... extremely short life ---> Specially with 4+ players.
4- Impossible to play with 4+ players ---> 3 AP actions per turn against your poor pirate.
5- I can't see the point for destroying a Pirate Port by a KC.
6- Loyalty is always high.
7- No crippled wounds = Less theme.
8- Alliances are useless.
9- It's the same to capture a Flute and 3-Masted Square Riggers ---> The old Blackbeard was much realistic.
10- It's very easy to change your ships.
11- Double Cross, General Pardon and many others cards are ridiculous and killed the game.
12- You can be the best pirate and lose the game ---> Someone used 10 pirates (few VP each) to win.
13-You can't attack another pirate.
14- Where are the bordings???
15- Bad ratios for selling booty ---> Read old Blackbeard rules.
16- Where are the plastic miniature ships??
17- Why ransom a hostage when you can torture him...? ---> Torturing makes you gain much more.
18-They have mistaken Ship MANEUVERABILITY with Ship Speed. A galleon was faster than a sloop.
Etc...
I want to play with only one pirate, not 15... Frustrating. It's Blackbeard on speed. I expected much more for a reprinted and revised edition. Pity!

Overall boring and try.

No, seriously, I tried it. And tried to imagine what the original AH version must be like to play, having read about it and seen some videos. The GMT remake, having cut down on the simulation side, is apparently trying to be a light beer'n'pretzels CDG. Unfortunately it falls on a middle ground between a chromey take that -card game, which it essentially is, and a "simulation". For a quick-playing card driven game it's too fiddly and has too many little rule details and tables to refer to, but doesn't really offer enough strategic or even tactical depth either to really be worth the effort.

For example a couple of mapboards for ship vs. ship and ship vs. port tactical battles wouldn't have hurt to make it more of a game. Gotta give an extra point though for probably being a pretty damn good game kit, if one would be up to crafting such stuff around it. I however don't have the time or patience, and have too many other games to play.

I never played the 1st Ed by Avalon Hill (I want to!!). But this game is showing its age. It has easily been superseded by the game Merchants & Marauders (with its expansion)...

Blackbeard is fiddly with all its little bits/chits that tend to overtake player's boards.
Player escapades in the game are tracked by chits accumulating on the player's board. This could have been better handled by a slider - such as was done with morale or ship attributes.
Tracking cargo hold contents of "booty" is accomplished by marking a quantity in boxes with chits. Ex: 1,000 doubloons of treasure is tracked by placing four 1/4" counters (a "1" and three "0") on the player board.
If you bump the board, everything slides.

Many of the items that require tracking are better accomplished by:
- Laminating the player boards and using wet-erase pens, or
- Utilizing dice (a hand full of d10 and d6)

To more readily distinguish player's pirates from others, you will need some sort of disk or "standee" colored base to put your "pirate(s)" on (see pics) - otherwise you could accidentally move the wrong pirate.

This is a Card Driven Game (CDG).
it does not play like the modern CDG games (Paths of Glory, Twilight Struggle, Washington's War, etc). On your turn, you play as a Pirate. The other players are playing an "anti-pirate" role. They play cards to hinder/prevent you from doing "actions." After your turn, the process moves to the next player around the table (and so on). Because of this huge "take that" style of play for the anti-pirate players, the game is fun for the first play through. However, after playing this game a few times, your turn feels like you are taking one step forward and two steps back. In a 3 or 4-player game it feels futile to try to attempt anything. The game feels as if it going to last forever as no one is accomplishing anything. I would have preferred the CDG portion to have been a little more thought provoking and offer more strategy or critical thinking.

This is a very good pirate STRATEGY game. It's not so much a pirate adventure game, and it's very risky to play it like one, as concentrating on one pirate can be disastrous if he's killed. 

Deciding how to play your cards (as actions, events or Anti-Pirate actions) is one of the keys, and at first is hard (at least it was for us) to play the AP part well. Again, it's easy to concentrate on your pirate(s) and forget about the other player(s), but once you do put as much energy in playing the AP, the game becomes much more interesting.

These thoughts are about the 2 player game, where only one AP action can be played on a pirate each turn. This changes with more players...

Really in depth pirate simulation that tries to be somewhat historical (like many wargames) while also trying to avoid downtime for players.

05/13/08 Played 2/3's of a four-player game. 
I own the 1992 AH version. It had many drawbacks. So I looked forward to playing this version. Several things have changed, but nowhere near enough. Some things are better, some things are a little worse. All in all they even out to make this GMT version no real improvement. I have no idea how this version's solitaire game plays (which was the saving grace of the 1992 version). But my one 4-player game left me feeling if I never saw this GMT edition again it wouldn't bother me a bit. A couple of specific comments. 1. Tan, tan, tan, everything is tan! You look around the table seaching for a particular type of counter, everywhere you look you see tan. Tan merchants, tan governors, tan pirates, tan KC's. Even the map and cards are tan. Uggg!  2. Good - got rid of the hex grid and absolutely nothing to do on an opponent's turn. 3. Bad - still dozens of charts/tables to roll dice for. 4. Bad - the game still drags when its not your turn. Sure, you might spend 10 seconds playing an anti-pirate card, then its back to sleep for 20 minutes, waiting for your turn. In this universe pirates didn't die from being hanged or shot, they died of boredom from endless dice rolling and waiting in vain for their turn to come around again.

I am a bit generous with my '8' rating. A good game no doubt but I was also heavily irritated by some rules misconficts, too similar eventcards (many copies of each other) and random big swings in scoring the Kings Commissions cause. Fun but not what I expected. 4.11.2008: Rating dropped to '7' which Blackbeard deserves.

haven't played it yet but have read the rules carefully

the mechanism wherein players play anti-pirate cards on other players turns would work even better, thematically, in a game about presidential elections than about pirates.  In this pirate game, the anti-pirate actions represent the hand of fate mostly, whereas in an election game those actions could represent the back-room interference run by political operatives of a campaign.  

After playing: uggh. hate.

Looks very nice.  First play a bit underwhelming, as we didn't think we could do enough in one turn with our pirates.  The cards could use one extra action each.  However, will certainly play again, and I'm sure the game length will reduce quite a bit.  Some good laughs were had as we played, so not all bad.  After a second play and two solo jobs, it was with heavy heart I decided to trade.  The new game just did not catch us, in that we felt it ended too soon, and that we hadn't time to do enough during the game.  Too bad.  One of the only bombs fom GMT.

Game mechanics seems to dictate too strongly how the game is played.  You are almost forced to attack all the other players in order to clear your hand of cards so you can draw new ones.  Very few meaningful decisions to make, likely no negotiation, bluffing, or cooperation.  The required "action" to find a ship seems beyond pointless.  Too much detail for what should be a fast, simple game.  Very little planning involved.  Grpahics on the map and counters make it way too difficult to find things on the map.  Players have too little input in what happens.  It's mostly just a lot of work , with the game, rather than player decisions, determining the outcome.  Much monotony.  2-4 hours.

They never put down their quick reference sheets or the rulebook either, so it seems like it is a bit fiddely.  May be too much working against this one for me to ever want to try it.

I think this is the game that has finally made me admit that I don't like complicated wargames with zillions of charts and bits.  Much as I would like to get into them, it takes too long to master these, and I won't play any game enough times to really appreciate the strategy of such a complex game.  I was hoping this would be a lighter game with a slightly more realistic pirate theme than, say, Pirate's Cove.  Well, it's certainly more realistic... but it's also not fun (to me).  I can understand why a certain set of gamers would enjoy it, but I'm not one of them.  If you are a heavy gamer that doesn't mind lots of chits and tons of chart looking-up, ignore my rating.  But if you're a more casual gamer (like me) and think, "Hmm, maybe this is the game to make me like chits and charts," I would probably take a pass.  (And note that when I say I'm a casual gamer, I mean that I'm more casual than a wargamer - I still prefer "heavier" Euros to lighter ones... see my ratings for what I mean.)

Played twice. Won by 100+ pts each time!! Would like to play again and it was enjoyable but... I think too fiddly given how lucky it is. The vps you can get from different pirate actions also seem to be unbalanced - defeating kings commissioners is definitely profitable and if you have a brigantine and rerolls quite likely. Destroying ports doesnt seem to give you much vp benefit compared to just looting merchant ships. But given all that , still played surprisingly quickly (~2hrs even with the end game card at the end of the deck).

You are a pirate earning notoriety for your dastardly deeds; seize merchant ships and rob them of their booty, sack and plunder foreign ports, take hostages and ransom them back, fight storms and scurvy, seek safe haven in infamous pirate ports, avoid the King’s Commissioners who strive to put an early end to your dark career, and if you're lucky you may even secure a Letter of Marque and retire.

Blackbeard is chaotic, fiddly, and luck dependent.  I found it hard to plan anything the way I got knocked around by "Must Play Immediately" cards and other players' Anti-Pirate actions.  By the end of the game I only had one pirate that got any booty - and only 200 measly dabloons!

RATING: 5
Better than I expected it to be. The best thing about this game is, by far, the event deck, which can really make for some interesting swings in the game state. The rest of the game feels pretty ho-hum though. You're basically just trying to amass wealth and retire your pirates at the right times in order to score points. This game actually feels a lot more like a Euro than I expected it to. At the end of the day though, the components aren't that great, and I think Merchants & Marauders does the exact same thing in a more exciting way (Even though it isn't that great of a game either). With a new edition that has some more chrome and updated rules, this could be a really great game again.

The rule book isn't as bad as everyone makes it out to be though. I would actually say it's one of GMT's easier rule books to digest.

RATING: 3
More an antipirate game than a pirate simulator. You can't do much things in the game with your pirate. Even with a zilion options possible to play, i couldn't do much because of the antipirate actions. You can try to find a merchant navy to botty, I didn't find any in my game, need a specific roll to do it, but even then you must roll against warships or king Comissionars, and if you escape with a good roll of a dice you lose your action. You can also lose your pirate if the mutiny event is played, depends the luck of one player, you can also try to attack a port and destroy it for money and notoriety, just roll a dice. With a 4 player game you can be atacked in the same action 3 times. All of this is resolve with the roll of the dice. The luck rules the game, you just play antipirate cards and play one action card, role the dice and wait for the result, that's my feeling, but I know there is a strategy to play somewhere, must found where. I will play again, because maybe it's me, not the dice, sorry, the game. Anyway, It's a fun game and it plays fast after learning all the rolls and modifiers. For now a 6.
After a second play. A 3. The luck rules the Game.

After first play:

Typical Richard Berg heavy rules with lots of tables, die rolls, and exceptions. Lovely components in the latest edition, with a beautiful map bij Mark Mahaffey. The game itself is fun, although managing the luck factor of nasty die rolls can be frustrating.

Needs more play, and will certainly get it! Very fun so far.

Update:
After more play the rules are less of a bother, but managing luck (cards & dice) is still key. Playing with Living Rules (+2 KCs and WSs) is a must. The ratings stands.

Blackbeard is not so much a game as it is a light simulation. So far I have enjoyed playing it. I can see why some don’t - the game is unbalanced and there is a lot of luck involved. To me that's just fine. In this game you're a pirate and you take huge risks and either succeed or die. I would like to rate the game higher but I can’t and here's why. Even the 2nd edition rulebook is a mess and the game lacks proper player handouts. Therefore playing this game is cumbersome.

Ugh.  It's not broken, but wow, is it ever dated.  I was under the impression that they were updating the game to modern standards, but all they did was stick a pair of those fake nose-and-glasses on the game and ship it.  The game is essentially a formulaic exercise with a "take that!" card system; certainly games have moved well beyond both of these mechanics by now?  But my problems with the game don't end there.  The production value is quite low: Cardboard map, overly thin and small counters, and uninspired artwork.  Production values aren't a disaster by any stretch, but when a wargame company tries to branch out and do non-wargame, they'd better try harder than this.  In addition, the rewrite of the rules was very sloppy.  In addition to the spelling mistakes, which are understandable, there are multiple references to boxes or areas on the board or player cards that simply don't exist; probably a hold-over from the first edition.  In addition, a game that should take about 5 pages of rules to explain takes 20+.    It's a real chore to get through them.  And this was an improvement over the original game's rules?  Then we have the gameplay itself, which is a random series of dice rolls and chart look-ups.  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the theme.  But this game could have just as easily been about dogs playing poker considering how little input the players actually have in the proceedings.  The days of rolling on charts is long gone, and going through such monotony with Blackbeard reminds me of how far the hobby has come, and how some games just shouldn't be printed without a truly critical approach to their updated design.I'm not rating the game a 1 because I don't believe its broken.  But it does deserve the 2 I'm giving it, that's for certain.  Oh, and be very afraid if you should be the first player to take a turn.  All those anti-pirate actions will be burning a hole in other players pockets, and you are sure to draw many times more wrath than the next player to take his turn (as the anti-pirate cards will be expended by then).

I must confess this wasn't a great deal of fun, and we couldn't believe it ended as quickly as it did due to the King's Pardon card appearing again - so much so that we played on anyway. The government forces are easy prey for the pirates, and I gave the game away by attacking another player with them and handing him oodles of VPs in the process. Disappointing. 

Played again with the living rules 15 months on, and it's a vast improvement. I still managed to hand VPs over using a KC, but at least it was in a fair fight this time. Upping my rating to an 8 (just)

Cutthroat and brutal-only way to go in this one. 

Similar to Talisman in that it is an experiential game.  Not for euro-gamer snobbery. 

The ability (necessity!) to play cards against the active player means there really is no downtime. You are constantly looking for opportunity to stick the knife in somewhere.  

And if your opponents are any good, they are doing the same during your turn.

Played with 4 and 5 so far. Up for trade as I realize I will play this, but I don't want to teach it. Sold 6/12

Atteso per mesi, si è rivelato una grandissima delusione. Eppure la GMT aveva rivisto e modernizzato il vecchio impianto di regole e reso graficamente più appetibile la plancia e le carte. Peccato che il nuovo impianto di regole sia lacunoso, di difficile interpretazione e molto pesante. Peccato anche che il gioco sia più noioso dell'originale, il quale ha l'attenuante di avere regole scritte il millennio scorso. Pesantemente dipendente dal Caso, troppo per un gioco del terzo millennio. Si salva la grafica, anche se la plancia è un foglio di carta lucida e i segnalini sono quelli dei wargame. Acquisto sbagliato.

After 1 play:

It reminded me of a dungeons and dragons 2nd edition experience without the personalized characters or story or the fun. 
For a boardgame it has a LOT of reffering to tables.
The board is ugly, the pieces are very similar looking and tiny.
It seemed to me like it was based on a computer game that the designers were trying to stay true to instead of a neat fast fun game.
I felt that there was a brilliant game lurking under the surface but it was overly cluttered by rules.
There is a good bit of player interaction - thwarting of your friends but this didn't quite make up for the bad bits.

The new version of Blackbeard.  I am not going to compare it to the older version but judge it on its own merits.

The map is attractive but it is thicker paper type.  You probably will need a sheet of plastic to hold it down and play the game.

There are a lot of counters to this game.  Markers and such everywhere.  I ran out of anti-governor markers which is good because I didn't really like them much.  The advantage of having them take over is it forces you to attack more ports.

You don't get the feeling of sailing around the ocean just moving from location to location and the merchant ships are all based at port, never sailing around.  

Good assortment of pirates and the ship cards work but I rather see something that resembles a ship more.

The cards are fine, glossy but not much variety.  Got bored with them.  And there are some really annoying ones too.  

This game tends to be get in quick, get some booty and then retire.  If you don't, there are just too many ways to wipe you out.  Pirates don't last and your career will end shortly.  So hit a few big ones, and slip out into retirement.  Playing multiple pirates is a must or the game ends too quick.  This concept does not make it fun to try and build a career.

I found the game fun to play and works best with multiple players.  Playing solo is just ok.  I didn't do the solitaire rules though and just played as if I had 4 pirate groups.  Lots of interaction between players with this one.

Even though I highlited some of the issues, I still had a good time playing.  I rated it an 8 for theme, quick playability, high quality, and player interaction.  But I would tone down some of the easy killing of your competitors so you can build a little bit of a career.

RATING: 4
One of the most involved pirate games I've played. After just 1 playing I am still deciding on the game. I think it will be good, but it was hard to tell after stumbling through the first game of it.

Played again, but I am starting to lean towards the side of not liking the game too much. Its fairly complex and I am constantly having to hunt in the rules for everything. Additionally, how the mechanics work for timing of card plays, or for using the KC's and many other options is leaving me scratching my head many times during the game.

Played a third time, and I started to warm up a bit more to the game after another round of trying to decipher the rules. The people I played it with again were not very  thrilled with it, so I guess I won't try to keep pushing it.

Played a forth time. The rules really are too much of a disaster to call this a good or enjoyable game. To get any kind of feeling that you accomplished anything takes playing the longer (5-6 hour) game, which really prevents it from being fun.

RATING: 6
One play, 5 players

It's Bang! with a board and a lot of rules.

Players control pirates who do piratey things like loot merchant ships, raid ports. Pirates accumulate notoriety points and money with which they try to find a safe pirate-friendly port to settle and retire before being killed.

Imagine an Arkham Horror or Tannhäuser style game in which you control a character (who is always a pirate) with various traits, each of which are represented by a numerical value. Each pirate controls a boat that also has various traits represented with numerical values.

[b]Problem #1:[/b] Games like this tend to require lots of bookkeeping, and Blackbeard is no exception. There is a tiny cardboard chit to represent almost everything! For instance, to represent the amount of notoriety points a pirate has (which are converted to VP) or monetary value a ship carries, you don't use play money or chips -- you use numerical tiles to represent each digit!

On your turn, your pirate has several actions to perform, and a limited number of action points to do them. You have a hand of four cards. Most cards feature a choice: either play the card to use the indicated number or action points or perform the specified action, usually to the detriment of another player.

When a card is used to harm an opponent, it is played anytime (with some restrictions) during your opponent's turn, not yours.

[b]Problem #2[/b]: This game is basically a take-that game, in which the game itself encourages you to stick nasty cards to your opponent as often as possible (you always refill your hand back to four cards at the beginning of your turn.) This kind of interaction is the only conflict between players in this game. Unfortunately, because of the nature of take-that games, and the sheer number of nasty cards that could be played, there is little (if any) strategic consideration with regards to attacking players -- you can't build up your resources (and take the appropriate risks) and truly do something horribly nasty. 

However, because you must play nasty cards during your opponents' turns, it keeps you involved when it's not your turn; you have to pay attention to what your opponents are doing since nasty cards can only be played when your opponents perform certain actions.

The theme is actually quite well integrated into the game. However, the theme itself is implemented by lots and lots of fiddly rules.

[b]Problem #3[/b]: This isn't a good combination: Lots of chrome and not much strategy. I will gladly put up with highly convoluted rules if the game itself offers rich tactics and strategies. However, Blackbeard has a beer-and-pretzels feel to it, strategy-wise. No one should slog through a thick rule book for a game this light.

Good points:
I gave this a 6 because I was fortunate enough to have (a) someone who taught the rules very well and (b) a gaming group that revels in badmouthing each other. However, there are so many games out there that allow me to talk nasty to my gaming group without the rules overhead that Blackbeard offers. If it wasn't for these two points, I would probably rate this one a 3.

Five was probably too many players for this.  The game was over before it really felt like it had begun.  An interesting Pirate simulation, but the warship intercept rules still seemed confusing (especially when the same warship could fail to intercept multiple actions, but cancel all of them).  I'd like to try this again with fewer players before I give up on it completely.

The recent plays of Merchants and Marauders has given some interest to some of my game group to play Blackbeard.. in hinde site, I think my expectations of what I wanted Blackbeard to be was different than what it is and that curbed a lot of my interest, originally.

After a couple more plays, I have a much better understanding of what Blackbeard is all about and while it is not an adventure-esk game like M&M, it is very interesting with an interesting game tempo and interaction.  I really like my new finding appreciations of this game and I'm glad that I've found some people to explore it more with.

There are one or two things that I don't feel is right, I hope they get addressed in the living rulebook.  Mainly, torture the way it stands rewards the pirates that are not cruel even with MUCH reliability.  There has been a proposal in a thread here at the BGG that essentially reverses the mechanic.

A simulation of pirate life with great artwork and theme integration. Players represent one of six pirates, each with asymmetrical strengths and abilities. Blackbeard is a card driven game at its core, with each card introducing a unique event impacting you (or your opponents) and/or providing action points (used to navigate your ship, attack merchant vessels, steal booty, kidnap, ransom and torture victims for notoriety, upgrade your vessels, attack a port, partake in debauchery and revelry to improve morale, etc). Dice are frequently used to incorporate some randomness, e.g. in battle and when determining whether a King's Commissioner (controlled by opponents to chase you on your turn) catches you.

Oh dear the amount of randomness in this game, I mean seriously. The rulebook and card texts could have been much clearer. Yet the theme rises on the top and gives you somewhat historical feel, at least getting into to theme seems to be quite easy in this one. It's a fun mess and there is always some good laughs in this game, especially when other people utterly fail with their dice rolls or you hit them hard with the event cards. Beer&Pretzel pirate game.

Got to playtest a solo version of the game during playtest as well as play a copy of the game hot off the presses (prior to shipping.)  The multiplayer game is certainly the way to go as so much of the game is the player interaction as others try to play anti-pirate actions against you on your turn.  But the short game (once through the deck) felt too short as pirates looted and were quickly retired to lock up victory points.  The long game (twice through the deck) is likely to be the better way to play to encourage a bit more planning and attempting to do well with your pirate for several turns.  Lots of chits and bits to keep track of information, but a nice thematic package.

Played solitaire for the first time, and feels like a solitaire game first. 

This was my fourth attempt in five years to play the game - there's something I cant pin down about why I've found it such hard going - is it the set up? Or is it my attention span? 

But in the end, it seems jolly good fun, and feels quite like the real thing. A lot to deal with.

Very beautiful components.

There's a lot of potential in this game, and in theory this could be the ultimate pirate game, but ultimately the design is flawed. It is quite fiddly in what you roll or modify for this or that, when do you add or subtract loyalty and when not, etc. that prevents you from immersing yourself in the setting.  The anti-pirate actions, rather than making you feel more involved during other players turns which I understand was the design goal, just slow the game down and create a big take-that feeling.  And there are so many random rolls that could have been baked into the deck: e.g. A storm card could just specify the sea zone rather than make you roll and reference a chart.  And rather than playing action cards, which are almost always 2 or 3, why not just do away with that and just always have 2 or 3 actions?  And a lot more flavor could have been built into the pirates rather than just varying stats, like special abilities. and and... it definitely makes me want to take the basic structure and map and redesign a better game.

RATING: 3
--May2008-- At this point, I'm not a fan.  Perhaps the problem was that it reminded me over-much of a relatively disastrous outing playing an early prototype of _Archon_; perhaps the problem is that the rules are (despite updates) still ambiguous and contradictory in places; perhaps the problem is that it's still far too random, and that there's still far too much downtime.  Maybe I'm just the wrong audience.  But I didn't enjoy the first play at all:  and that despite the fact I won.I didn't enjoy the take-that mechanics.  The game took far too long (5.5 hours!) for its play value.  I'm not interested in indulging in the rules-lawyering necessary to play it cleanly.  So:  I'm happy to avoid it in future.

Berg likes "why"s.  So, a couple:
 * I don't like the specific take-that mechanics of Blackbeard, even more than I dislike take-that in general.  I am of the opinion that bash-the-leader is a viable if inelegant mechanism for making games close.  Yet in Blackbeard, if I find my hand full of relatively useless anti-pirate cards, I must play them on my opponents in order to flush them from my hand.  I may thus play an anti-pirate card capriciously on an opponent that not only is not winning, but is possibly not close to winning.  While that may "simulate reality" in some sense, it it not particularly appealing play.
 * I don't find that the game does a good job of simulating reality.  That's not at all to say that it doesn't have realistic color.  It does, of course.  What it doesn't have are mitigating factors (other than the trivial port knowledge that one can acquire by torturing a hostage.)  There are no modifiers for finding a Merchantman, for example: every search for a Merchantman is like every other.  One cannot intercept the mails, bribe a port authority for information, patrol the sea lanes, or otherwise affect one's chance of success in any way.  It gets old.  Similarly, (again other than the information that one acquires from torturing hostages) there are no additional modifiers for assaulting a port.  One cannot scout the facility, plant an agent, or even attack from the rear.  I had hoped for a greater scope of piratical ingenuity, and did not find it.

RATING: 5
This is a tough one.  When I first got the game and played it, I was taken with the level of detail (in both components and rules) and got into the role-playing aspects.  I played it at least half a dozen times, solo, and enjoyed it every time.  My rating during that time was a very satisfied "8".

However, I have since discovered other solo games (like Arkham Horror & Ghost Stories) which offer a more balanced and strategic experience.  Blackbeard is very fiddly, doesn't seem particularly well play-tested, and most importantly, doesn't allow for complex strategic planning.  You move around, roll dice, things happen, and you either win or you don't.  I don't get the sense that I "won" the game or "lost" it because of some decisions that I made.  I am also tired of seeing the same cards over and over - I wish there was more variety in the events and actions.

I have added a number of house-rules to both simplify and expand the experience for me, but I'm just not sure if I'll ever pull this off the shelf again.

[UPDATE:  2/22/09 - decided to spend the weekend completely re-writing solitaire rules.  Playtested it a couple times, and it's feeling much better.  May hold onto this thing for a bit]

(UPDATE UPDATE:  why would anyone buy this game instead of Merchants and Marauders?  Not that I own M&M, but it clearly surpasses Blackbeard in every way)

(UPDATE: 12-17-12: after having read a little about Nemo's War, I have a feeling that is the game people should own/buy if they want a solid solitaire pirate-like experience.)

First edition had innovative mechanics for its time (and still hasn't dated that poorly). This update is a shocker in how to make a good thing worse. The flavour of the game is stripped and mechanised into a system that's very formulaic and run-of-the mill. The dynamic turn structure of the first edition has been replaced with a boring 'we all take turns to do stuff' structure. I playtested an early version and it seems like there could have been less focus on graphics and more in actual development. How GMT could turn an elegant fun game into a dull inelegant beast is a mystery to me...oh wait, fire the developer. : )

Do yourself a favour: buy the original or if you bought this one, trade it for the original.

Not for me. Oh, I suppose I could be talked into playing again, but I'd rather do something else. Two things. 1. It's a bit of a luckfest, and you need to accept that going in. It's a bit long for that. 2. As I write this, there is too much thrashing about with the rules. Too much, "try this" then "try that" with rules problems. I don't think it was ready to be published. After we finished a game the other day, I asked a guy to my left: "Would you buy it?" "No.", he said. "If you were at a convention and someone asked you to join a game, would you?" "No. Probably not." My feelings exactly.

Sigh, what a disappointment.

I really love the old Blackbeard.  While it certainly had its problems, it was always a fun experience game.  Sometimes you'd have to wait a while for your turn to come up, but you at least had a real opportunity to do stuff when it was your turn.  The paltry action points given diffuse any advantage of getting a regular turn.  Many turns are spent doing nothing notable, sometimes you feel lucky if you can do anything even remotely worthwhile.  Most of this game now just revolves around a "Take That" system, so like many of these kinds of games, you feel like you are taking three steps forward and two steps back.  Many of your turns are spent in maintenance, cleaning up the mess left by the cards people play on you. There is a huge luck factor, with the cards and the dice, which certainly is in the original, but here all of it is in place to create friction.  I'd rather crazy bad luck that tells a story, rather than events that cause me to lose a turn, force the next couple turns in wrote actions, or negate the work I had just done.

It seems like all the fun of the original has been reduced into a something still a bit complicated, but devoid of what made it fun in the first place -- Adventure, movement, story, and action.  All in all, this is by far the most boring pirate game I've played, and that's saying a lot.

Ok, I have to say it, I can't believe that they don't have pictures of a ship for your pirate as they sail around. Lame.

There's a rule for Debauchery and Revelry.  There's a rule called Booty Grab.  What's not to love?  Well, the rules still read like a combination of your insurance contract and your car lease, except with more self-contradictions and three completely different but concurrently operational sets of rules for how warships and KCs are supposed to work.  So, maybe that.

This game is dripping with theme and fun.  It is not overly difficult to play and flows rather well.  High player interaction!  The components are good, but would be excellent if functionality was a bit better.  The artwork is fantastic.  The game has thick glossy cards which are durable.  However, the gameboard is unmounted cardstock.  The spaces for Hostages and Letters of Marque on the Pirate Display cards (also cardstock) could be laid out better; however, this is a minor issue.  The rulebook was difficult to get through, unclear, and could have been better written.  The Living Rules on GMT's website clear up just about all rules problems.

The designer cleverly cashed in on the 'Pirate' popularity wave, but sadly could only deliver this very weak release.

Think about this: pirates spent most of their time sailing around without much to do. If you want to play a simulation of this exciting pirating life, Blackbeard is the game for you.

I've played this "game" twice, once with two and once with four. With two, the game moves along and has a few redeeming qualities. With four, it's quite awful. In either incarnation, you have to roll a die to determine whether you can make an attempt at most actions. If you succeed, then you get to roll another die to see if you accomplish your intended action. But wait! Players can interrupt you by playing cards, which, most of the time, end up canceling out your action anyway. It's best if you just accept this fact, and drink lots of rum instead.

By the way, did I mention that this game takes 2-4 hours to play? Bring an extra bottle. You're going to be here for a while.

No fun. Except for the rum.

This game was a disappointment; I appreciate the history that went into it, but it's so bogged down with obscure rules and tables and the element of luck is so huge (even if that may be accurate to the age) that it's not very fun. We gave up up halfway through after 4 hours; this may be a good historical simulation of piracy, but it's not a very good game--would play Merchants & Marauders over this any day.

There's a long line of failed pirate games that I've tried, and this one joins the queue.  Not quite historical simulation, and not quite rollicking high-seas adventure, this game attempts to meld the two styles, but gets the benefits of neither.  This rating reflects Blackbeard at its best, which is as a solitaire or two-player experience.  Definitely don't try this with 4+ players, as not only does the game time dilate significantly, but players spend even more time dealing with anti-pirate events, leading to a frustrating two steps forward, one step back gameplay.

Combine all this with an absolutely stupid amount of rule lookups for almost every card play, and this game can be a steaming load of anti-fun.  If you're looking for a pirate game,Look at [gameid=25292].

Was super excited to get this game and try the solo variant rules.  Unfortunately, it was boring.  I pulled the game out a 2nd time a few weeks later to try again but didn't get very far because I was so bored.  In my opinion, solo rules that consist of "do whatever is best for the other players so that they have the best chance of winning" are a cop out.  That is essentially what the solo rules ask me to do.  I don't need a rulebook to say that to me, I could do that with any game not designed for solo play.  Disappointment.

There's chaos.  There's randomness.  There's a lot of take-that! in the game, too.  All of that can lay to waste any carefully laid plans on your part, which can be a little frustrating, but with the right crowd, it can also be a lot of fun.  I played half of a game with 4 players, and then half a game with 3 players when that fourth player had to leave, and I prefer it with 3, since there's less of the above three things to destroy your plans.  Playing this with more than 4, though, I think would be painful.  The jury's still out on whether or not this is going to be a game with legs for me, but so far, I'm interested in playing again.

Never owned the original.  Finally got this version when seeing that R. Berg decided to streamline the game.  Though I can't say whether it's an improvement over the original, I can say in having read both rule sets, this version is much more approachable by the Eurogame player though this is not by any means a Eurogame.  The rules still read like a wargame manual with lots of cross referencing.  The game revolves around a lot of "take that" actions against you while you're the pirate player.  You'll be giving the same as you get when someone else is taking their turn for their pirates.  This might put off some players that don't like that type of game.  Overall it has good production value with a nice cardboard map (not like the original mounted version) and nice cards.  I like the historical theme and more accurate representation of pirating versus other pirate games on the market.  This one is more of a gamer's pirate game though still with a good amount of luck in the die rolls which again may put off some players who want less luck in their games.

First impressions right of the box and after reading the rules:
- fabulous box
- lots of (unimportant) typos
- should have a lot more involvement from all players each turn
- can't say as I am in favour of the Attack History mechanic only affecting Ports, but not Merchants or Warships. Same for the Letters of Marque; it looks like you could have a Letter of Marque from one Nationality but still wail on their ships.

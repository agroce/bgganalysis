An interesting game that I played extremely poorly. For some reason I just could not get a city built to save my life. As a result I suffered a ridiculous defeat. I'd really like to give this one another go but I'm not going to go out of my way to play it again.

When it's OKAY run out of money: at the end of the round.  When it's AWFUL to run out of money: after the first auction.

Played once with five.  Lasted only four or five turns.  But it seemsed to last a while.  Wasn't overly excited about it, but that's what I said about Hermagor, and I have since bought that!

Traded away.

City building/job owning/area dominating game in medieval Northern Italy. Bid for cards to either build cities or control positions of power. Place armies through building cities or certain positions of power.Lots of different ways to score. Far more to the game than the original reading of the very small print and not particularly well written rules implied (we had to go on the geek to clarify how the final round was played re money situation). Early reaction despite above is very positive.

{2 plays, 3-4 players} Another one of those "it all works, but... " games.  The 4-player game had so few turns in it that I never felt like I could build to anything.  The 3-player game gave me more opportunity for hand management... but only if I got the cards I needed in the first place.  If you don't, and then none of the "right" colors come out for auction, there's not much you can do.  The auctions themselves were quite sterile: money is so tight, it wasn't uncommon for bids to go "2, pass, pass, pass."  On top of that, there was never any real struggle for board position - though some cities were better than others, any placement on the map was good.  And the ability to win a "free" placement anywhere kinda devalued the 4 cities up for purchase, which in turn negated your maneuvering to get specific cards.  Some interesting mechanisms here for sure, but the game around them misses.

Very impressed from first 3-player game.  Looking forward to trying this further... Enjoyed equally as much with four.

Nice production.  Last year Oltremare (first edition) was a big game in a small box.  This year Il Principe could have been in the same sized box as there is a lot space inside the box, which happily also contains an excellent game.

Now played with 5.  Disappointing.  Game finished in 4 rounds (which unless I am wrong on the card count it nearly always will) which means there is no chance to score 2VPs at the game end for each of the building cards that you have played least of as this will always be zero (as there are 5 different colours and only one colour can be played per round).

7.5 rating based on 3 to 4 players only.  With 5 down to 5.5.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.8
Bidding/area control game with roles being assigned at the end of each round (the player with the most 'influence' on a given aspect/activity gets the assorted role) that help gain additional VPs from other people's actions on the upcoming round.

All in all, the only exciting thing about the game for me was the bidding part, but then again I could be playing other bidding games in its stead if that's the only fun part..

Challenging medium level game with lot's of roads to victory. Very intricate scoring system. Money seems particularly important so don't run out.The rule that in case of a tie the players tied bid for the role stresses the importance of money even further.

Original rules are a drama. Do not attempt to play after reading the original rules as they are full of errors and ambiguities. Get the updated rules from the geek and enjoy this great game as it should be played.

A massive mix of euro mechanics into one game.  Area control, bidding, blind-bidding, set collection, varible powers, etc.  It sounded okay as it was introduced, but then as we played we were all underwhelmed.  I think part of the issue was that the auctions felt like they should have been tight but were just uninteresting due to a lack of money.  Someone bidding 1 or 2 was in good shape to just win the auction.  Silly and I don't think I'll play it again.

A slightly below average economic game.  It features a carefully crafted mixture of mechanics (auctions, stock collection and area majority), but the result is very restrictive gameplay.  The game feels forced, as if it is playing you.  There's a lot going on but you have little control.  In particular, there is too much randomness in the availability of city cards and resource cards... and players lack the degree of control neccesary to adapt to the randomness.

There is one small fault in the german rulebook. And 2 auction phases is one to much for such a small game. There should be another tie-breaker rule! Auctions cost to much playing time. I have added each Player 2 coloured dice and one pair of neutral dice, so these auctions will go with few words and fast. The dice will set one by one, till no one has ducats or dice. Neutral dice can only set to a previeusly set own die. When one of your die is outbet, you may add your second die or one neutral die. Otherwise you can take back only own dice and set for bet to other building cards. Under these dice-rules, i recommend the variant rule, as mentioned at the end of the rules!

Lo probamos en la casa rural en Diciembre 2009. Tenía el aratctivo añadido de contar con un tablero en el que aparecía Padova. Tiene parte de subastas, y a lo largo del juego tienes que ir planificando qué hacer con las cartas que vas obteniendo. Al final de la partida, hay un reparto de puntos en función de quien tenga la mayoría en los diversos estados.

Bastante interesante. Lo equiparo a un principes de florencia en cuanto a complejidad, aunque las mecánicas no tienen nada que ver.

A smorgasbord of various gaming mechanisms. There's auctioning, card drafting, area control. When it all comes together, it's clunky and underwhelmingly okay.

There is no way to earn more money other than to go for the gold colour role; this constricts strategy.

The components of the game are small and crappy.

Thoroghly uninspiring. That's not to say bad; just uninspiring, that's all. Some mechanisms were put in a blender, and a game came out. It works, which is saying something (with the minor exception of the fact that there are *way* too many pointless auctions), but like OltreMare before it this is a game about figuring out how the game works, not about actually making decisions or judgements or having fun. For some, this kind of game is great, but for me, not so much; the game feels very disjointed, and the theme is incoherent. I think Caylus does this sort of puzzle-game much better.

This sounds harsh, and probably is given that the rating is a "take it or leave it" 5 and that the game does work and is playable. But there is a lack of anything in there that would make me want to play it again.

I'm not entirely sure what to think of this one.  There are a lot of intermeshed mechanics and ideas here, but I'm not convinced that they come together to build a very solid game.  I felt like I was doing stuff, but that the stuff I was doing wasn't necessarily controlling how well I did in the game, nor did I feel there was much room to make clever plays in order to better my position.  Overall, just too many chaotic ways to score points rather than a solid system.  Despite this, it still managed to be somewhat fun and I wouldn't be opposed to playing again.

Il Principe is an exceptionally strange auction game that has layers built upon layers with the final product merely being an ok game.

The principal (hah) goal in the game is to acquire victory points which is mainly done by drawing the correct cards, or winning them in an auction, then investing those cards into roles, and then having people build the right thing at the right time so that your role provides victory points. There are several other layers going on, for instance, an area influence battle on the board which one has to keep track of to be in the running at the end of the game, but the roles seemed to be where the biggest points were there to be had.

Now, how does this work and why am I feeling a little blah about it? The main problem is the lack of real control within the game. There are two major places where this rears its head: 
Firstly, in terms of control over the placement of pieces on the board. The right to place pieces is dictated by a pool of 4 cards. These show where your influence chits can be placed, and additionally show the cost in cards to play them. Having the right card up at the right time is fairly important, because otherwise your hand might not be suitable for playing it, or the place where you could put your chits might not be useful. Because the pool is only 4 deep, and tends to change quickly, it is difficult to plan ahead for this, which is brutal because one of the first steps in each round is to draw some cards, and then to choose 2 which are thrown into an auction pool, presumably because you won't need them. So you're essentially being asked to know what cards you're going to need in the round ahead, and though you can make some assumptions, you can never be entirely safe on that point.

Secondly, a major source of victory points is acquired via the roles. These give you points when other players put down area control chits which use cards that match that role's colour. The problem here again being that you can look at the available card display, but it is difficult to know which of those cards are actually going to be used. As each one is taken, a fresh one takes its place, and this means that one slot on the display might continually rotate, and a role that looked very good, might turn out to be not so hot.

There are some nice touches in this game that made me want to like it; for instance there is a money based economy that makes it very difficult to both win more cards and put down more influence chits, but I think overall the game system feels like a mish-mash of strangeness, and it ends up being very unintuitive. Additionally, as I highlighted above, the ability to control one's fate is questionable, and that sort of thing generally irks me in a game like this, because the system is asking you to look ahead to get the most VPs, and the best value for your cards, but your ability to do so is limited. Catch 22 is a fine book, but it's not something I think of as a noble characteristic in games.

RATING: 7.5
To be honest the first play was probably a 7 but our group wanted to play again and would have barring time restraints. The rules are very consise (perhaps too concise) and the strategies and tactics aren't very obvious in the first playing. You really have to balance your timing and objectives. In addition money is extremely tight in this auction, building game, so much so, that cards used for building may actually be passed on by all players, thus being disgarded from the game. Still, its a very interesting game and I'm looking forward to trying it again. The review sounded somewhat negative but to be clear its a good game just a little hard to see the best way to play out of the gate. The english rules could have used some work as well.

The game itself is a simple enough Euro mixing set collection with a bit of an auction and a touch of area control. The production of the game is somewhat lacking however. Notably the box didn't need to be the size it is and the cardboard counters are a fairly thin card stock. Based on 1 two player game.

RATING: 7
This game is a medium weight Euro involving bidding, set collection, area control, and variable player powers.  Each turn, players are dealt cards some of which are selected to be auctioned.  Those are gathered into color groups and auctioned by color group.  Upon winning an auction, that player may opt to build one city.  Building a city earns veeps, gets cards into your tableau, and allows you to place markers into map regions.  Once all sets are auctioned, each player gets a turn in which one thing can be done: build a city or play as many cards as they have and wish of a single color into their tableau.  The tableau cards are gathered into color sets.  According to majority and second place, privilege cards are awarded.  These give a variety of powers and can result in additional veeps during city building.  The trick is, if a player wins a major privilege, half of the cards used to do so are turned face down, making it less likely they'll win it again next turn.  Clever game, and quick too.

We're not sure why this isn't recommended for two players.  It's worked well that way for us, though it must be tighter with more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Update: rating improved on second play. Most of the mechanics I thought were kind of cute. Only thing I'm not keen about is that your color cards largely dictate the city cards you can try to buy, and so you don't really have a lot of control on the map. You don't really get enough pieces on the map for it to really be a territory control game. Still, I've enjoyed my two playings and would happily play it again.

This game should appeal to me: it is a fairly intensive auction / majority game with a relatively small playing time. Unfortunately, it tries to be too much for its own good; just like one of Ornella's other offsprings I played, Hermagor and Assyria, Il Principe beats you senseless with tons of ways to score points which seem to add up to pretty even results just the same. I'm not one to complain about subject matter, but in this game it made my eyebrows rise&mdash;it appears awfully far-fetched. The playing material is too tiny and fiddly. Il Principe feels like all sorts of mechanisms were thrown into a blender which was turned on. The result was expertly seasoned, and I'll give the designer credit for producing something which actually seems to work, but you cannot create a nice mix with just seasoning alone. This game might have been all the rage in 2000, but not in 2005 (when it was released), and most certainly not thereafter with similar and better functioning majority games on offer. Il Principe is interesting to have tried if you like majority games, but I regret to say the result is quite a forgettable title without anything to call genuinely its own.

Feels like there is a 1,000,000 ways to score in this game.  Need to play it again to see if there is a specific strategy to follow.  

Fun set collection, area control, and bidding game.

Update Dec 2010 - I continue to be drawn by and confused by this game.  The interesting depth in this game keeps me coming back.  The only problem is that the theme makes it very hard to get gamers rallied up to play it.  The secret is to go for 2nd place.

This is a very nice, quick-paced game with several aspects: auctioning resource cards, building cities in a territorial map seeking geographical majorities, gaining roles somewhat like Puerto Rico... and there's one aspect of scoring which is like Tigris & Euphrates where only your worst color counts.

Plays well with 2 players and with 5 players (and I'd expect 3 or 4).

Altogether, this game was a very pleasant surprise. It was cheap, on sale at a big discount... and I figured a $14 game was better than paying $14 in shipping. Very glad I did. Nice find.

Rating after 1 5er game.  I think we got some rules wrong; so I hestitate to describe with much detail.  We were discarding cards after buildings were built and I think they should remain in front of you...and count towards acquiring master/apprentice roles.  I expect playing with the correct rules will see this game go up a point or 2.  Plays pretty quick and for once I'd say the box estimate is about right...60-90mins.

Players yet again visit renaissance Italy and build stuff, attract workers, etc.  Players manage a hand of building cards, which are really just five colours.  Each turn they must donate two of these cards to the auction pool, which ensures cards and money move around a bit.  City cards are built using building cards, which gives players points and regional influence on a pokey mapboard.  Building cards can also be played onto the table to attract persons which give you extra bonuses.  Victory points are awarded for pretty much everything in the game.  It plays quite well, but feels like if the kitchen sink could have been squeezed in, it would have.  Rulebook is in tiny font, and difficult to read - it's also incorrect (you do get cash in the last round of the game - this is huge).

Emanuela Ornella doesn't disappoint with his new game - I actually liked it a bit more than Oltre Mare even, but that could be a matter of taste. Game mechanics are very clever (with some getting used to necessary), and the end result might also have to do a lot with the draw of the cards, but still this is a very interactive game (and the interaction is on several levels: auctioning, counter placement, competition for role cards). All these elements combine to form a complex whole that can at no moment be exactly pinned down (for example who is REALLY leading in VP's). Might be a bit dry for non-geeks, but gamers will have a lot of food for thought here.

This game does a great job of making infinity plus one different ways to score. No method is really overpowering, but certainly owning roles and building cities is important. That said it's just not that interesting. This is probably the highest of the 'second-tier' eurogames I've played. If you are a big fan of the multiple paths to victory idea, Il Principe does a good job with that. 

I've been dwelling on my experience with this game and I think the problem is that everything is too well integrated. That is nothing really stands out. Il Principe has auction/area control/set collection/role selection aspects but none of those really stand out. What you're left with is a game that wears a lot of hats, but none really fit.

This is one complex card game! Your cards do so many things: earning victory points, acquiring roles, building cities... Ouch! Also the money is very tight, so bidding is quite difficult and you'd better get the amount right the first time around. The difficulty seems to be in figuring out exactly what is worth something. Still, this seems to be the kind of game that rewards strategic play, and I'd like to try it again.

Il Principe is a stew of tried and proven mechanics. First and foremost it's a two-tiered majority game (area majority and "share" majority) but there's is some hand management and (too many?) auctions by the wayside.

The game offers many different ways to score a small amount of points. So many, in fact, that your actions often inadvertantly benefit other players almost as much as yourself. It seems like those multiple layers actually make figuring out how the game works mechanically more interesting than playing against those other players. The choice of what to do to best your opponents often feels trivial while e.g. upholding your cash flow to keep the game going is of utmost importance.

A game that gets played purely because of curiosity towards its inner mechanical workings probably doesn't really have a leg to stand on.

Playtested. This is quite a gamer's game very different from the other's Mind the Move titles. There is a lot of going on to keep track but few rules. Luck factor near 0%
++++++++++++
A rapid rules view:
 This game is set during italian Reneissance when cunning principi struggle for power. There are 3 major phases in the game:
1) Everybody draws 4 cards, takes 2 in hand and put 2 on dib. These cards are coloured and are used for build cities.
2) All the players cards are arranged by colour and bidded. If you win a bid you can immediately build one of the 4 displayed cities. You have to lay in front of you the right combination of money and cards then you can put your influence markers on a region next your brand new city. At the end of this phase you can or buy a city or lay any cards of one colour.
3) Now the minor and major roles are assigned according this rule: who has the majority of a colour takes that major role and his privilege, while the minor role goes to the second. Then who got the major role flip half of his coloured cards. The roles are vital to win because they earn you vp when someone build a city using cards of the same colour(s) of your role(s).
At the end you earn extra vp if you have the majority in a region, for each set of 5 played coloured cards, etc...
There is a lot of going on and some tough decisions to take. You can aim a particular city and collect the right cards but someone who win a bid before you can build the town before you. And don't forget money is very tight!!!

A fine mix of few mechinics that blended together make a pretty coherent game. Not my cup of tea but I appreciate the idea of primary and secondary roles and their benefits as well as some kind of area control added on top.

Has a similar weight/feel to Kardinal and Konig/Web of Power and Oltremare, Quite tactical, but some strategy there, and over in an hour.  Could have had a bigger board or smaller box, and printing the rules in a tiny font on one sheet of paper folded - are the designers into minimal? And if money is meant to be hidden you need a screen.  But anyway, recommended.

From reading the rules, I did not expect to like Il Principe.  It sounded like an abstract mishmash of mechanics with no clear organizing principle.  And actually, that's exactly what it is.  There are layers upon layers, with cards in hand used to build cities, which give you victory points and cards on the table, which are used to secure roles, which give you victory points as well as other benefits.  And I haven't even mentioned gold, which is used in nearly every phase of the game, or the shield tokens which are produced by cities and role cards and which participate in an entire majority-scoring subgame.  But the parts do fit together very tightly and the whole thing makes more sense while playing than it does on paper.  It's a very interesting game tactically, but has an episodic or serial feel with no real narrative arc.  This isn't a big problem, though, because Il Principe plays very quickly.

I've enjoyed my four plays so far, but I'm worried that although the mechanics interlock beautifully, there may be too little opportunity to plan and execute a strategy.  There are too many cases where you're one gold short or one card short (either in hand or on the table) and you couldn't really have predicted it the situation because of the chaos of the card draws and the bidding.  In my second game, the player who won had no idea how she did so, and neither did I.  It seems that you absolutely must be in a position to build a city on the second round.  Money is so tight that there may not be enough room to maneuver strategically.  For example, you can't afford to bid very much on the auctions if you hope to build cities.

So I like the game but I have a sneaking suspicion that the game mechanics are so restrictive that they're forcing my hand - a little bit of the "game plays you" phenomenon.  OltreMare gave me some of the same feelings, but the trading and bargaining in that game gave players the opportunity to get out from under the tightly-geared game engine.  I haven't seen evidence that Il Principe allows for differing strategic approaches.  It looks like this will be one of those games that is good for several plays and then hits a hard ceiling once everyone has explored the nuances of the system.  Not recommended for five players, because the game seems to end too quickly.  Also, the strangely underpowered white (bishop?) role detracts from the game.

A building game where actually building stuff is often against your interests (because it hands other players points); an auction game where buying stuff is often against your interests (because then you can't build stuff)... Yeah, I don't like Il Principe.

RATING: 7
Good auction / majority game with special abilities. Having to think in different layers makes the game interesting. Money being scarce puts everything in perspective. Building stuff doesn't just bring you points, but increases the influence on the board (end game scoring) aswell as the influence on the roles that give you special abilities.

There are a few "complicated / small" rules that you must be aware of and that you probably won't expect in such a rather small game, but that's about the only negative I found in this game. Still nothing spectacular or new, though.

While teaching the game I joke that this is the ultimate Euro - it has auctions, area influence, set collection, special powers via roles, income allocation, and probably other things I'm forgetting.

It seems that things are too interconnected.  Often the game seems to hinge on having the right role cards during a crucial round or two (when many cities are built), and while you can try to set this up for yourself there feels like too much luck to it.

I don't doubt you could get into this game far enough so that the luck would fade, but I don't see it getting played nearly enough to get there.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A multi-layered bidding and majorities game where players bid on building resources which they use to build cities together with left over cash from bidding. Left over building resources are used to obtain influence over Roles that benefit when others build cities, while cities exert influence over surrounding regions and score points at the end. With me so far? Phew. Like so many games now, this is perfectly well done, but nothing really new. Scoring is tight so what little luck of the draw there is has an effect on the outcome, while the constant swapping of start player (it changes every time a new player wins an auction) makes the game chaotic. Try before you buy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nifty little tactical auction game with an area control element.  Like other Ornella games I've played, you essentially start anew each turn, though this element is slightly weaker in this game as you get to keep your cards and money. Auctioning off unwanted cards is a clever twist and I like the special powers.  The components could be a lot better, though--the map is tiny, the players are represented by very small shield chits that are distinguished only with difficulty, and the names of the cities are nearly illegible.  (1 play)

Pros: Lots of auction, some card drafting, and little area control. The game is easy to learn but difficult to figure out a winning strategy. Appropriate luck factor.
Cons: artwork is just ok, and there should be a way to figure out in advance the final round.

A new edition with a little of 'take that' and a better-written rulebook would be a great game.

This is a good little game that mixes some familiar mechanics together very well.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (February 2016)

I wasn’t expecting much from Il Principe. It is an ok auction and area control game.

The rules are pretty easy to grasp and you can explain them under 15 minutes, however the rulebook included in the game, is ugly (white and black), hard to read (small font) and it is missing some clarifications (for example, when you get a role you use it immediately. This part is only explained in an example, not the rules themselves). Overall the rulebook is very bad and unclear. Also, I read two sets of different rules, each set has a different scoring system used at the end of the game :/ and I’m not sure which one is the current one (nor I cared much about the game to find out).

The art of the game is also regular and boring (including the box of the game). The board is ok and functional, but they also dropped the ball with the player´s shields. They are very similar and hard to distinguish so you can make a mistake easily when scoring or when checking who is controlling an area. The game box is too big for what comes inside.

Pasted theme. At first it seems the game will take a long time, but it doesn’t. It flows rather quickly.

The game decisions aren’t that obvious (Which city to build, which cards to play, which character(s) to pick and when, how much to bid?) so I had some fun playing it. This is the redeeming part of the game. Money is very tight in the game.

On the bad side, I’m not sure if the characters ‘powers are balanced, the blue one seem overpowered, but I need more games to verify this and I’m not sure I will get those plays. There are some luck with the resource cards you draw but there is a lot of luck with the city cards. The cities dictate where you can expand your influence and you can’t predict in any way which cities will appear. This is the reason I feel the blue character is overpowered because he let you place a shield in any terrain. Due to this, I’m not sure you can plan ahead very well, that is, I feel I have very little control over the game.

Bottom line, Il Principe is an ok game, but nothing out of the ordinary. Its rulebook is awful, I would play again if requested, but my overall desire to play it again is rather low. I already sold my copy of the game.

A little too familiar - getting commodities to make contracts, some area control... but it hangs together nicely.  The primary innovation here is that the commodities you use to complete contracts (which score points) move from your hand to your display.  Then these become used again in a majority battle for special powers, which score more points.

Disappointing components.

Whoa, this game is probably the most convoluted assembly of multidimensional abstract VP scoring opportunities ever published. Throw in a mix of auctions, area majority and set collection and you have a good overview of all existing Eurogame mechanisms. Even Knizia's scoring schemes look like math for beginners compared with Il Principe. All these dimensions added up to a rather random outcome on first play. Proof given that more is not always merrier. This became more obvious as we played Santiago afterwards which fits in the same niche and duration but delivers more with far simpler rules. Rating is more likely to move down than improve.
Mistake on first play: Only other players get VP's for roles, not the builder of a city.

Ornella's post-Oltremare games seem to be quite complex with a bunch of rules that are almost too hard to remember on the first play.  However, both games are fairly simple when you start playing.  But there are a ton of ways to score here - I cannot even begin to envision how one would formulate a strategy, as there are so many options.  Ultimately I guess a lot comes down to the auction phase - if the right cards come up, great.  If not, you're out of luck.  In our game, there was one round where only one color of card was offered, throwing off the entire round.  Still, I think the game plays relatively quickly and I would like to try this out a couple more times.  I could see my rating going either up or down with further play.  But my initial impression is positive.

Traded away.

A very intertwined economic-type game. There are so many things happening that interact with each other that it gets a little confusing at times. Money is tight and players must balance their resources against everything else. Rules are TERRIBLE. Everytime I think I understood something, the designer contradicts the rules here on BGG. 

Components are so-so. A larger scoring track (and map) would definitely have been better.

I don't know if we had all the rules right, but in a way it was really nice that it didn't last long. For winning I just went for the blue color on every occasion and it worked brilliantly, but that was the only viable strategy.

My initial thoughts on this were actually pretty good, but when I gave it a few more plays, I realized that any choice in the game is really just an illusion.  It strives so much for "balance" that almost everything you do is equivalent to pretty much anything else you might do, and therefore it almost doesn't matter what you do at all.  In the end, winning is almost random and hollow.

If you plan on pulling this out once every year or two, then it will be fine, but repeated play will reveal very quickly how shallow and weak the game actually is.

Interesting game this. It doesn't take too long, medium weight and is fun to play. But just how much luck is there? Can you really figure out a smart way to win? So many points are scored without you being able to affect it. I'm willing to play more and try to find out.

Meu primeiro eurogame, comprei em fevereiro de 2010. Estava por um valor razoável na Art Games e resolvi experimentar. A primeira coisa que salta aos olhos acostumados ao mercado brasileiro é a qualidade dos componentes. Tudo muito bem feito. O jogo é bem interessante, com ideias boas e divertido de jogar.

RATING: 5
Very chaotic in feel! It's less chaotic than it seems. The awful tiny dark colored thing which passes for a map board is a problem, made up in part by the incredibly fast play and overall short playing time. I think the box said 60-90 minutes - if this goes for 45 minutes then it has outlived its welcome by a good 5 minutes at least.

Why is there a different board pictured in the rules at the ZMan site? These rules are different from mine, especially in the scoring at the end. Oh, and don't even get me started on the crappy tiny text in the printed rules. Poor job on this game. I'll play it again because I rcvd this as a gift and own it, but warned of these problems I would never have bought this.

The auction is appealing. The description is appealing.
Tom Vasel isn't impressed. And another reviewer writes: "Mediocre theme, a difficult-to-use game board and confusing rules of tiny font are all culprits. But if you can get past these flaws, you'll find a game with startling ingenuity and a devilish learning curve that rivals Caylus and other recent classics." 

With all this in mind, it seems like it's not worth buying.

With the auctioning for one resource and then using that win for a further resource, this seems a little bit like Augsburg 1520.

After several plays this has grown on me, mainly because I have come to better understand what the game is and, more importantly, what it isn't.  It's a decent midrange bidding and building game with interesting tactical decisions to make, but it's not a long strategy game because it ends at about the time that it would get interesting.

2-5p, 60m. 2005.
By the designer of Oltremare.
My first time playing it seemed to drag a bit.  Later, I found out we had at least one rule wrong (resource cards go face up in front of you--not in the box.)
The bits are "ok" but not great (the linen-finish cardboard counters are too small and fiddly--wood would have been nicer).  The map is too small.
I think I'd rather play the designer's previous game, "Oltremare - Merchants of Venice."
I ended up trading this away in exchange for Santa Fe Rails in mid 2006.

11/08/08 Played a three-player game, once. Z-Man edition. It took a little getting used to this quirky game. But I enjoyed it and look forward to playing it again. Three minor quibbles. 1. The box is waaaay too big for what's in it. Why the board doesn't fold is a mystery. 2. The turn sequence cards are so tiny its very hard to read the print on them. 3. The score track is inadequate. Today I made 97 points. So I went around it over two times. I suggested the owner make some "+40 VP" chits to hand out to players each time they pass zero. 12/23/08 Played another three-player game. 04/21/09 Played a four-player game. 10/10/09 Another four-player game. 07/24/10 My first five-player game. The cards ran out quickly. 07/23/11 Another three-player game. 01/15/13 Played a five-player game. 05/19/15 Played a five-player game.

Intriguing game that mixes a bunch of old mechanics (bidding, tight ressources, roles) into a rewarding whole. The rules could have been a LOT clearer, and I don't like the fact that just about everything is worth VPs, but these drawbacks aren't enough to offset the fun of playing. I like how getting control of the big/small roles have to be timed with your money/ressources so that you'll get more points when building a city, this creates a nice little pace to the game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A mish-mash of mechanics (area control, player powers and auctions) a tight economic system and card-management (helped by drawing the right cards) all add up to an OK game.  I definitely want to give it another try considering we played two rules incorrectly (as interpreted from the rulebook: a) players DO get money on the final round b) cards spent on cities ARE placed in front of you to add to your influence (rather than discarded).  One thing going for it is the quick play-time.  Some possible frustrations: card draws may not be in your favour as you're often hoping to buy the available cities (which cost a mix of different card types), the city you're hoping to buy may not be there when you get a chance, the influence you have on a colour may not be as valuable as it initially looks since new city cards with different colours (than you have influence in) may come up and be purchased by the other players (once a city is bought it's automatically replaced by a new card), a player may outbid you in the one colour you need... sour grapes.

Aukciós-többség szerzős-lapokat gyűjtős "hand management" Ornella maestro tervezőasztaláról.

Jól összerakott, érdekes mechanizmusokkal és pontozással, bónusz pedig, hogy egy fokkal még szebb is talán, mint a Hermagor.

A játékról:
- városlapokat építünk, amikhez különböző színű kártyákra van szükségünk, amiket aukcióval és húzással szerzünk meg
- építés után GYP-t kapunk és 1-2 tartományra helyezhetünk le családi címert, a játék végén tartományonként a legtöbb címerrel rendelkező játékos 5 GYP-t kap (a második 2 GYP-t, többiek egy nagy nullát)
- minden kör végén, amelyik színű kártyából a legtöbb van előttünk, kapunk a színhez tartozó "fő" szerepet, ami egyrészt azonnal valami extrát ad (+GYP, +lap, stb), illetve a következő körben, ha olyan színű lapokkal építkezik valaki, 1 vagy 2 GYP-t kapunk

4 fázis van:

1. Kör eleje
 - mindenki kap 4 lapot a pakliból, kettőt megtart, kettőt bedob a közösbe (ezeket fogjuk később licitre bocsájtani)
 - és minden játékos kap alanyi jogon 5 dukátot (pénzt)

2. Licitkör
 - aukció: színenként licitálunk az eldobott lapokra (magyarul ha négy ugyanolyan színű is van közte, akkor azok egyszerre elvihetők)
 - aki nyer egy licitet, akár építhet is már várost (nem kötelező, csak bónusz, a licit megnyerésének egyik előnye)

3. Építkezés
 - VAGY megépítünk egy adott várost színes lapokból + dukátból (amiért GYP-t kapunk azonnal és a várossal szomszédos tartományokra letehetünk x címert), a városért kifizetett lapok elénk kerülnek (set collection mechanizmus ON)
 - VAGY nem építkezünk (mert nem tudunk, vagy taktikai okokból nem karunk), de leteszünk a kezünkből egy (de csak egy) adott színből tetszőleges lapot (ez számítani fog a köv. fázisban, ahol a szerepek kiosztásra kerülnek)
 - ha valaki építkezik, minden játékos, aki rendelkezik olyan színű szerepkártyával (az építkező játékost kivéve), amilyen színű lapokra szükség volt az építéshez, pontot kap (egyet vagy kettőt)

4. Szerepkártyák újraosztása
 - színenként megnézzük, ki előtt van a legtöbb színnel felfelé lévő kártya és ő kapja meg az adott színhez tartozó "fő" szerepet (döntetlen esetén licit)
 - aki nyert egy szerepet, az adott színű kártyáinak a felét (felfelé kerekítve) lefordítja, azaz a következő kör végén az már nem számít bele a szerepek leosztásánál
 - a megszerzett szerep akcióját azonnal végrehajtjuk (az 5 szerephez tartozó akció: +GYP, +lap, +dukát, egy kártyát visszafordíthatunk, egy címert letehetünk bárhová)
 - a 2. legtöbb (színnel felfelé lent lévő) kártyáért a "kis" szerepeket lehet megszerezni, amik csak 1 pontot adnak építkezésnél, cserében viszont egy kártyát sem kell lefordítani)

A játéknak akkor van vége, ha már nem lehet 4-re kiegészíteni a város kártyákat (ilyenkor azonnal), vagy ha az építési kártya húzópaklija lecsökken annyira, hogy már nem jut mindenkinek a kör elején 4 lap (ilyenkor az adott kör még lemegy, de kártyát már senki sem kap, és annyi kártya kerül licitre automatikusan, ahány lett volna a dobások után, tehát játékosonként kettő - ha ez sem jön össze, azonnal vége a játéknak és a végső pontozás következik).

Játék végén a közben megszerzettek mellett több mindenért jár még pont (természetesen az elején említett tartományokért is, ahol az első és második legtöbb címerrel rendelkező játékos kap pontokat: 5 és 2 pontot).

A térképen a többség szerzés nagyon jól össze van kombinálva az aukciózással, szerepekkel. Aki ezeket a mechanizmusokat szereti, tetszeni fog neki a játék. Szerencsefaktor bejátszik, de nem elviselhetetlen. Cserébe viszont van interakció bőven a licitálgatás miatt.

A játék kétségkívül jó iparosmunka. Aki játszott már Ornella-játékkal és bejött neki, ebben sem fog csalódni. Ketten is működik egyébként.

There are a lot of cool ideas here, and the prospect of all the interconnected mechanics is very appealing.  There are a lot of things to pay attention to while you are playing, and every action you take has significant ramifications on the game.

The problem, however, is that there isn't enough you can do about all the mechanisms to have control over what happens to you.  I think the auction is too tight.  There isn't enough money to make the auctions interesting, and as a result the person who bids 2 usually walks away with it.  There just isn't enough you can do to shape a strategy; you are forced to build whatever you can afford as soon as you can afford it, and hope you have a little money left over to bid on the roles.  A game with a lot of potential that really fell flat for me.

In Renaissance Italy, players are a family, trying to erect buildings, and compete in roles to VPs. Five different suits of cards are used. First, players select cards to auction. Then building occurs, then placing tokens into regions for area control purposes, then count card majorities for major roles. There is a lot going on in this game, and it does have some potential. However, the rule book was just a bit hard to comprehend, as we had to read some sentences over, but I think once you get the hang of it, it's okay. Almost everything counts for VPs as well, so it's a bit hard to grasp at first. I was probably the only one in my gaming group who thought this game was okay. Everyone else probably didn't like the numerous ways to score VPs, and once you fall behind, it is hard to catch up. If you can grasp what you need to do early and buy buildings at the right time (then when everyone else buys them, you earn VPs when you own some of the roles), the game will be okay, otherwise if you are behind, it is tough.

If there was ever a game to give legitimacy to the "Euro games are for wimps" argument, this is it.  Il Principe awards victory points to the players for doing everything short of drawing breath.  You can stumble your way through the game with only the barest idea of what you're doing and still rack up a competitive score.  Whoever plays best will still probably win, and at the end of the day I think it's fairly enjoyable, but it's not a good choice for a "main course" game.

First impression (3 players): Area control, auction and card management game with couple clever twists. There is some interesting balancing and timing when and how to use your cards + money. You need both to buy influence to areas + points but on the other hand you need cards to buy certain privileges that grant different powers and also you need money to be able to buy cards from auctions. 

Three players was actually pretty good number for the game which is pretty strange for (half-)area control game.. Probably four players is the optimum number for the game.

Bought cheap at Milsims, July 09. Seems to be a good game, but board is dull looking and too small. The rules are poorly translated, badly set out and printed too small, and in B&W.

Nevertheless, looking forward to playing.

It's an average game. I can't fault it, but equally there is nothing outstanding about it. The game is an auction game with strong area majority and hand management elements. 

I have played with 5 players, which I feel takes too long (2 hours).
2 player is quicker (1 hr), but the area majority element is less interesting. Competing for the role cards is still interesting - and more transparent (since there are fewer opponents). 

However with only 2 players (or 3 players) there will only be 6 cards up for auction each turn. With 5 card colours that means they are generally being auctioned in groups of 1 or 2. It seems the only sensible bids for 1 card are £1 or £2 so IMO the auctions don't work well when there are only 6 being auctioned each turn. 

I think the optimal number of players is 4 or maybe 3.

I liked this game in my one play.  Bidding on a certain color was multifaceted as it affected your ability to build, gain privileges and score more points.  My first instinct was to rate this game higher, but I have a feeling I will actually like this game less as I play more.  Needs to be played again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An awkward game, combining set building with area majorities. Money is very very tight, so the difference between bidding 1, 2 or 3 is huge - so one of the most important decisions points throughout is whether you can afford to go low and get away with 1, or bid safe with 2, because it's certainly not worth 3. An area of concern is whether an early leader (they've lucked into a card combination that gets an early build and therefore gets lots of early powers and points) can be chased down. Combine this with the tightness, and one or two things not going your way can knock you fairly heavily. It doesn't get requested a lot, but I find the game interesting enough to hang onto for the occasional play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Mechanics fit together quite nicely.  Need to explore whether a runaway leader can be effectively dealt with by the other players.  If so, may be an 8, if not, a 6.  Gift to Ares WWP Auction.

RATING: 7
Early reading of the rules seemed confusing, but it really isn't too difficult once you figure it out.  The key is that cards used for building are left in front of you, so the cities you build are often based on what you need for majorities, instead of simply based on what is convenient. 

Definitely want to play this again.

This is a neat little auction game with a touch of area control and a touch of set collection thrown in.  It was good to try to get stuff down early to claim the tiles, but at the same time you don't want to overpay for your cards.  I really liked how cards were "used up" when tiles were claimed, it kept everyone in contention.  The game has some visual flaws, mainly having to do with the board being way too small.  Also, colored cubes would be much easier to see than shield tiles.

The driving decisions in this game is like a stockmarket, in which you speculate, auction and play "shares" in 5 colours, on display like Union Pacific. Your display of certain shares is forced out for VP reasons at a cost, as well as gaining the UP type majorities to get game benefits, especially to place scoring markers El Grande style onto an Italian region. A game rife with ways to score VPs, even co-operatively from your opponents building certain building using colours which you have a majority benefit. A common gaming experience i.e. interesting but neither exciting or fun.

hm... what good things can I say about it? It's pretty? The way that the game plays out should have been separated into two different games, one to gain roles which do stuff and one which is area control. The problem that this game has is that the roles are too powerful and that they go away too easily. Money is also too scarce and needed too much, too easily trackable. This combination and that the game seems to go too fast for any meaningful interaction says that this game is in the trade pile.

Apparently we played this wrong. It still doesn't solve some of the problems.

I have only played two players.  I don't think I will bother playing two player again because there wasn't enough competition for the victory points, We didn't have enough cards to choose from during the opening phase, and every turn each player either got the majority bonus or the minority bonus.  I like the neat idea involved in the draft mechanic for auctioning off cards.  But it does not work with two players because late in the game, each player will throw the two (probably of the same color) that they have an overabundance of and no one will really want to buy anything.  It doesn't work all that well.  I can see this mechanic working fabulously with three or four player.  Even though the game says for two and for five, I don't think I would play it with two again, I don't think I'd play it with five because I can see the likelihood of tons of boring downtime.

Most of the time it plays itself, but there are a few key points where a miss bid by 1 gold can cost you the game - if it hasn't been cost for you by another player's accidental actions. Definitely works, but the chaos/control/length/effort balance isn't quite right.

Some bars have a drink they call 'The Bucket.'  What they do is throw a dash of every liquor they have into a pail of ice.  It smells like that guy at the corner with the shakes.  It tastes like you just vomited and forgot to brush your teeth.  Why is it that drinks taste fine in certain combinations, but are terrible when *everything* is mixed together?

Il Principe is like a small sip from 'The Bucket'.  When you have 18 possible goals to work for, all of which are tiny and completely different, how in the world can you choose a strategy?  Particularly for a game as short as this?  The fact that there are so, so many small rules seems to hide the fact that the game lacks a core of inspiration, some central idea to give it its own unique flavor.

Rating based on one 5-player game, so take it with a grain of salt.  I was confused throughout my one game; I feel like it deserves at least one more chance.

the role cards both give you lots of points and give you the cards/coins you need to keep getting roles.  So, once someone pulls ahead on card influence, they stay that way.  The mechanics fit together in a fascinating way, but the end result is lockout/snowball which is really too bad.

--Oct2006-- A fascinating experience, though I still can't claim that I've got much of a clue.  I've now played with 2, 3, and 5:  the 5 player game seemed too short, too arbitrary, and too random.  The two player game was pretty nice, and the 3 player game even better.  I'd love to try with 4.

You know, this is a solid little play.  The form factor has some issues, pieces that are too similar and rules that are written in too small a font but after your first play and with a few cubes or some meeples those issues go away.  I'm looking forward to another game of this.

This game is about piecing together all the varied ways you can gain victory points and coming up with the right combination depending upon the play of the game. Ultimately though the extreme lack of money in the game tends to produce some strange auction results and lucky/unlucky turn order that's out of your hands. Still, there's plenty to think about in what seems to be typical Ornella value meshing fashion. I'm interested in exploring further at some point. I'm told it plays better with four than with five three might even be the sweet spot. Certainly further play has confirmed that turn order (which is largely out of your hands) is all important.

Il Principe (Amigo edition) -- Played once; four-player. 

I'm told the two-player version does not compare well. 

A strong mixture of mechanics requiring balanced play, Il Principe offers almost too many options each turn. I wonder if more play will make the overabundance of possibilities more manageable. I look forward to finding out.

Major Roles offer more points (than Minor)  when someone else builds cities, but they also require that you deactivate half (rounding up!) of the correspondingly colored cards, thereby making continued use of that Role unlikely. I generally appreciate balancing mechanics, and I remember finding this method innovative.

Minor Roles offer the same bonus powers as their Major counterparts, and while they garner fewer points, they do not negatively affect the same-color cards.

Building cities allows placement of several colors in one's personal play area, but this advantage comes at a dear price in coins which could be used in auctions. 

Constructing buildings only allows the placement of cards of a single color in one's play area, but at no additional cost.

This game is about choice. Which cards to keep and which to put up for auction. Which then to attempt to purchase at auction. Whether to pursue unwanted cards simply to have the first chance to build the city of your choice.  Whether to allow others to build while you have Roles which garner points. The glut of choices may seem overwhelming, but it's also empowering. Choices minimize luck. It's just that in this case, they happen to inhibit long-term planning as well.

While production quality is high with the Z-man edition, there are some implementation issues which sully the gaming experience. It's as though the game was never play-tested using the actual product. The map/board is simultaneously wasteful of space and too small to properly accommodate the chits. The space alloted to the Role placards is entirely unnecessary and could have been used for a larger map. The turn order cards use very small text to accommodate text in two languages on one side. Instead, each side of the card could have been used for a single language, thereby allowing larger text.

I enjoyed my first play quite a bit.  I waited to purchase a copy until the release of the new Amigo edition, as I'd learned that it addressed many of my complaints about implementation, and I'm so glad I did. This edition makes for a better gaming experience.

A serious brain-burner of a game. I was pretty surprise by the amount of calculation and consideration that could go into improving your game.

RATING: 7
At heart, this is a gamer's Euro with intermeshing mechanics (auctions, role selection, building, area majority). The theme is pasted on (Feuding families in renaissance Italy) but the game zips along at a decent pace with 3.

Each turn, cards are put up for auction. These cards are then used to build buildings and/or laid down to win roles (which gives bonuses: money, etc). Buildings give VPs and a chance to lay down control markers for area control scoring. Money is artificially tight and the turns are tense.

The game feels slightly overly balanced and might potentially drag with 4/5 players. The rules are shockingly poor and the board is incredibly small. If Ornella wanted to put the game in a big box, just go all the way and give it a big box treatment!

If you like games like Goa, then you'll like Il Principe.

I quite enjoyed this designer's Oltre Mare, and this sounds good and my GBs like it.

Update: played a 4p with a gamer, a moderate gamer (wife), and new gamer. Me and the gamer liked it, the other two did not. That probably tells you quite a bit. It's not complicated per se, but it is not immediately obvious what the relationship is between cards in hand, cards on the table, the majority scoring tokens on the board, etc. It takes a couple rounds to "get it" -- definitely not a gateway game. I'd like to play it again before deciding if I should keep it or not.

There are so many moving parts here that I want the machine to have a purpose.  I think it works.  I did win, so I really can't be sure that there is any skill in this.  Mostly I just like the way this frankengame is stitched together.

The concept of this being in Renaissance Italy is amazing.  I feel that this game really captures time and place.  Oh wait, no, not at all...

I really think that this game deserves multiple plays before I really can gauge how I really feel about it.  It plays so quick that I feel that if you don't know exactly how to jump in the fray half the game will pass you by before you can figure out how poorly you spent your precious money.

UPDATE: This has been a tough sell to get back on the table.

Great auction game.  The most interesting thing is that your cards enable you to build cities and gain roles, and the balance that having a minor role allows you to keep the cards face up is a nice twist.  The area control piece also is a nice added element to add for some other decision points.  The only downside is that the ruleset is confusing - look at the Rules here so that you can play it correctly.

I had trouble wrapping my head around the rules and strategy, perhaps because it was getting late.  Need to try again!  Update:  played again and barely remembered the game for a while, which isn't the best sign.  As opposed to something's missing, this game feels like there's a bit too much.  Everything seemingly scores!  Also, in games where you're vying for area majorities, you need a bigger board!  It's also strange that you can run out of markers.  It's alright, but not one I would request.

Only one game but it was interesting; a bit of auctioning (the core of the game, actually), a bit of set collecting and a bit of area control.

Interesting game where cards used to bid on cities (for VP) are then also used to influence roles which grant other VP and/or special abilities.  Also has a minor area control mechanism.  After several plays this game is starting to grow on me.  There's a lot going on here: bidding, area control, role selection, even a minor progression mechanism where past success influences future success.  The rule booklet leaves a little to be desired (for instance, it doesn't make clear that players do get income on the last turn) but overall this is a very good game.

Great strategy game which is not very complicated. The biggest advantage of the game is that there are several ways of geting victory points, so players can use diffrent strategies in order to win.

A terrific game that offers a ton of options and strategic choices within a very reasonable time frame. Some of the special roles may be a bit more powerful than others and not drawing the right building cards in those colors can be frustrating, but overall I think the exchange of a bit of luck in card draws is worth the tradeoff of keeping the game to an hour or less. There's a ton going on here, but it's all tightly woven, well balanced and works together beautifully. This is one I consider a hidden gem that has not garnered anywhere near the kind of attention it deserves.

The game was a bit of a brain burner for 5 people. It takes a few rounds for people to get the hang of the flow from one phase to the next. Pretty dry game, but it is a meaty game.

In glancing over other reviews of Il Principe, several words stand out, including: forgettable, lackluster, subtle, dry, etc.  Il Principe is a perfectly fine auction game with a tiny board, bland components, and an exhausted theme.

There is a good game here, I know it. I just can't play it. It isn't the game's fault. I played it around 5 times, and [b]every time[/b] with a rule wrong. The same one!

I knew the proper rule and still played it wrong, because it was "natural".

Even with this, the gameplay is smart, there is a fine amount of interaction, beign a set collection and a area control game.

I was so ashamed of the several games played wrong I had to sell the game.

It reminds me somewhat of Lucca Citta, in that the cards serve multiple purposes in the game, but the main difference is that in Il Principe, you have to commit your cards to a singular purpose early each turn and hope that things will turn out your way by the end of the round.  This isn't a bad thing, since it creates some nice tension and turn angst, but the area control aspect of the game comes into play twice, through the card play and through the maneuverings on the board.  The game has a nice flavor, and I would be interested in playing again.

An auction game where income and resources are automatically gained at the beginning of each turn. Then the money is used to bid on more resources, then the resources can either be used (along with money) to build cities, or "displayed" to qualify for "roles" (like political appointments) which gain influence/VP-graft plus (a special power such as income boost, resource boost, VP-boost, or resource re-display.

Building a city gains the player VP but also gives VP to the opponent(s) with matching role color.  Watch out for the rule-set here - it is very hard to understand!

Played once (with 4 players). There are lots of things going on in this rather short game - probably too many to make it easy to identify a strategy and follow it. Points can be scored in multiple ways, some of which may seem a bit useless (such as the points for most money and most cards in hand in the end). Also, luck in the buildings draw can play quite an heavy role. Theme might be difficult to follow as well, but I don't consider that to be much of a problem.

There seems to be a conflicting design going on for Il Principe.  Although the play duration is short, there are numerous paths to victory that it quickly becomes overwhelming as one start to consider all of the possibilities; and just when you think you have a good engine going the game is on the brink of being over.

It is also very auction heavy (for cards and for roles).  As a result the lack of money is a constant problem, especially since it takes even more coins to be able to build a city.  This is a good example of a game that tries too hard and is too busy.  There are just so many things going on to pack into 60 minutes.  As a result, no matter how interesting its various parts are, the end product felt very flat and anticlimactic.

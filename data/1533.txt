[Children's Game]
Solid family game that works in so many different ways. It has very kid friendly components including an excellent cut-away castle map. It works very well with kids of almost any age. Because it's one against many you can easily play with younger kids and adults. The varients that are built into the game allow some scaling of difficulty depending on who is the ghost, adults or kids, which is a very nice touch. The game also works very well as a deductive game to be played by adults only, similar in many ways to Scotland Yard.

RATING: N/A
06+ or 08+, 2-5 players, good with any number, 60 mins. A 2 player game is more intense/deductive. KMV. For sharing. One player is the ghost and the others search for him.Asymmetrical play, similar to Midnight Party, Fluch der Mumie, etc.

Cracking game for the whole family--our 6-year-old loves getting to be the ghost (with help from one of us)--he's very into the "sneaking around" element that playing the ghost offers.  I find this a great alternative to "Scotland Yard".  The components and artwork are also a plus.

Good game to play with kids or with adults who will look past the board art.  The movement of the ghost is brilliant, since the ghost still moves around but the other  players can't necessarily tell even the location of Max, even though everyone uses the same board.  Be prepared to play Max a lot.  :)

(KIDS) We enjoyed our first play of this lighter Scotland Yard-type game that works with the littlest of gamers.  I was a bit surprised at how limited the movement was for the ghost chasers, but I suspect that experience will help us with this.  The second play was not great with just 2 players.  The third play was a lot of fun with 3 versus 1 and all adults playing.  Max was unable to move on his final turn and the Ghost Chasers won.  After the third play, I see now that the Ghost Chasers are limited in their movement but so is Max, especially as the game progresses.  Good stuff and I bumped up my rating from 5 to 6.

RATING: 5.5
Similar to Scotland Yard, but maybe a bit more strategic (and a better deduction game) since the ghost player cannot re-use rooms (except twice per game with cheat cards).  Overall it's game involving slightly educated guesses (and slowly plodding your pawns around the board to find or trap the invisible ghost).  I'm not a fan.  Games like this are better for kids.  I prefer deduction games like Sleuth.

RATING: 5
I keep comparing this to Scotland Yard.  At first glance, it seems that the ghost has the advantage due to the ability to move in any direction, whereas players have limited movements.  However, the expended resources (use of the cards) begins to entrap the ghost such that the game leans to the players.  It's a different but similar mechanic to Scotland Yard; however, I'd have to say that SY does it better.

Its more fun and challenging to play as Max, the ghost.  Playing as a hunter has its moments too, like watching the player being hunted sweat and squirm in their seat.  My son likes to play as a hunter and explore more than trying to catch the ghost.  The art is great, nice details abound each room.

RATING: 5
Beautiful components. I particularly like the way you set out tokens as a count-down clock. The artwork is wonderful. There are the omnipresent hedgehogs, too, which always brings a tear to my eye.

This game seems like its really meant to be a children's game. In our one playing, the ghost was never really in any danger (with 4 chasers). He only used two 'special' cards, but there was no way for us to really threaten him. I think with certain numbers of players it may not be balanced very well. 

Still, I am considering getting this one since I think my kids will love it.

RATING: 7
A &quot;one player against many&quot; game, featuring a ghost chase through a 54 room castle. One player plays the ghost, who must elude the chasers. The rest of the players play the chasers. There are interesting restrictions on each side. The ghost player may move through walls but may only enter each room once during the game. The chasers may only move through doors, but may enter a room more than once during the game. Every 4 to 6 turns, the ghost must reveal himself to the hunters, but the rest of the time his movment is hidden. Several special action cards allow the game to be balanced one way or the other according to taste. A lot of Scotland Yard in this, but I think I prefer this one. Fantastic Doris Mathaus artwork and a quality family game.

I don't plan to play Ghost Chase any time soon.

Did we play something incorrectly?  The ghost player won without any real challenge.  It felt a little like a non-game, but repeated plays might change that.  Learning the layout of the rooms and thus the best way to move around surely would make the chasers more adept.

Got at UK Games Expo for £4. 2 plays with Kite Jr and Mrs Kite. Playing as Max is quite demanding on the memory, and can lead to lots of referring to old cards. Movement for the Hunters is quite awkward, but each time Max was caught. Reminds me a bit of Fury of Dracula, but much better and more fun.

The card moving system makes this variant on the "Mister X" mechanic original. Fun for kids and adults alike. If you own ScotlandYard/NewYork or Museum caper or Fury of Dracula, you may find this unnecessary to own. Overall a solid family game as intelligent as it is cute.

A "Hidden Movement" game where the ghost hunters try to corner the ghost named "Max".  Good production values but  the game itself gets a little tiresome after a play or two.  My girls prefer to be "Max" rather than one of the ghost chasers. We don't play this one much but we are going to keep it for dark, scary nights when the electricity goes out.

This is similar to Fury of Dracula, Scotland Yard or even the Bio terrorist variant in Pandemic! Everyone is hunting for Max the ghost, who is played by one person! This is our favorite of this type of game because of it's simplicity and game play length! It has turned out to be great fun from 2 to 6-players and new gamers! The artwork is outstanding! The haunted castle with all the rooms is absolutely wonderful and the little animal time counters are great for playing with kids too!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I'll pull this out with the kids every now and then for their love of the theme. It's nice how you can vary the level of difficulty, and the planning as the ghost to avoid cornering yourself in is challenging and agreeable. I don't think the play as a hunter is all that interesting though, either moving in from the other side of the board or moving back and forth to herd a ghost in a certain direction until it runs out of options. As a result, usually it's kinda boring, but at least it's over in 30 minutes.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very similar to Scotland Yard, but more guesswork involved. Perhaps not as much strategy/deduction for adults but well suited for play with younger players or a mixed age group - although by no means a simple game, and with a few significant differences...

Hunters simply move one space per turn, but the ghost uses cards for hidden movement (similar to Fury of Dracula) so that you can only visit each room once. Therefore, a good memory of previous cards played is useful for the hunters.

Hunters are limited to movement through doors, stairs etc. whereas the ghost can move through walls and floors/ceilings. These different movement restrictions can make for interesting play. 

In addition, the hunters have a small amount of control over when the ghost must reveal his location, by choosing the order of the sets of animal tiles.

Very scalable in terms of difficulty (allowing handicapping) due in part to optional cards with special abilities for both sides.

Plays very quickly and easily allows all players to have a go at being the ghost.

This is a great deduction game to play with children! It is attractively produced, and the game play is at just the right level to be fun for kids and adults alike - namely, it's a children's game that won't bore you to tears. As an added bonus, it's actually fun. One player plays Max, the ghost, who moves invisibly about the castle. Max appears at various points in the game, providing a big hint to the ghost chasers. Everyone else plays a cooperative game as ghost chasers who are trying to enter the same room with Max, or force Max to enter a room containing one of them. Max can only visit each room once (with rare exception). So far, the ghost chasers have won every game, so we may have to give more advantages to Max. Fortunately, the game has a variety of special cards which can be added/removed to provide benefits to Max/the chasers. This is really nice, as it allows you to introduce handicaps appropriate to the ages of the players. It's a very thoughtful aspect of the design. If your child enjoys The Secret Door (a memory game for kids with a very simplistic deduction element) then get Ghost Chase. It's a big step up from The Secret Door. My only recommendation is that, for younger kids, make sure an adult plays Max as it may be difficult for children to follow the restrictions on his movement.

Do I need to mention that it's like Scotland Yard?

It's nice that you can adjust the handicap of the ghost with the special cards. I think the player of the ghost really need some experience so that they can use the way the humans have to move to their advantage.

My opinion differs from many of the comments here and I don't think this is just a kids game. Maybe they're fooled by the artwork. Non-gamers I've showed this to have LOVED it.

A very Scotland Yard-ish game that I picked up so there would be an alternative to Scotland Yard when we felt like that sort of one-vs.-many hunting game.  But it just didn't work very well with our group, and left me feeling empty.  Nice theme though.

RATING: 6
I liked it a lot when I first played it, and I wish I could still enjoy it as much as back then, but I don't. It's either too easy (being the humans) or too hard (being the ghost), and it's too dependent on table talk (human players), and sometimes dumb luck (the ghost). Not horrible, but fun once and a while, we play it around Halloween.

A simple and straightforward use of hidden point-to-point movement, which I like!  

*Owned for school - single copy*  Played this one for the first time with a few students this week.  Can be a bit tricky to make sure they're following the correct movement rules for the ghost since he's invisible, but at least they can't get too far off base since the ghost reveals his movements every 4-6 steps.  Other than that, the game is fairly simple for a hidden movement game, and my students really enjoyed it.

Similar to Scotland yard. A good variation to that game with a fun theme.

Just as we roleplayed as children characters get to run around an haunted house looking for a ghost.  Fun game from the Scotland Yard family of games that always hits our Halloween play pile.

Fun game, kind of silly for an older audience.  Basically a simplified version of Scotland Yard.

[b]A MOST EXCELLENT DEDUCTION GAME![/b]

Superior version of Scotland Yard.
A perfect information game that requires all of the players to catch the lone ghost player, in a marvellous co-operative, logic, deduction game.

Every game of this has been a hilarious mix of bluff and double-bluff, that has had us all chortling with deductive glee. As is usual with these sort of game-types, the ghost player takes on a sinister persona while trying to outwit the hunters - I myself really get a kick out of making "ghostly noises" during my turn. What a child I am!

Quality components, nice set of cards/standups, TERRIFIC cutaway board of Canterville castle, and a selection of solid card badgers, rats, bats, and cats - these provide a hilarious space/size recognition game for any adults playing.
Plays wonderfully with 5 experienced gamers, taking turns to play Max the ghost. You can even scale the difficulty for beginners by removing some of the ghost's powers; in so doing you can broaden the appeal of this little-known gem to a wider audience.

If you are reading these comments, then you are probably thinking of buying this game; do so! You will not be disappointed with your purchase.

NB. I replaced the card characters with the plastic playing pieces from the SCOOBY DOO! CYBER CHASE game, for an amazing Scooby haunted house variant; much more fun "being" Shaggy than merely "red".

Played this once and thought, "Eh, it's OK."  Never really had a desire to try it again.

This is like [thing=438][/thing], except the chasers are more constrained in their paths; however, the ghost is not allowed to revisit the same place twice.  As a result, the chasers start to be able to deduce where the ghost is — provided their memory holds up.  Fortunately, there are several handicapping mechanisms in the game, as well.

Nice bluffing game. When you're the ghost, you think it's easy being the chaser. And when you're the chaser, you think it's easy being the ghost! Unfortunately, it's much more fun being the ghost...(and there's only one!)

Mostly a game for kids, it is attractive in art and has a neat feel to it.

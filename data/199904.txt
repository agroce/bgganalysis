Maybe the deepest game I have ever come across by Mark Herman.

The brilliance of the game amazes me.  This is how you do competitive-cooperative.  Churchill did it, but it was 3 players together and apart.  This one has teams and among those, teammates fighting for the victory.  Fire in the Lake had this concept, but I always had a problem with doing something to your partner that would screw you over in order to keep him from winning and then all three players ganging up on the leader.  Maybe that's how it worked, but it felt too "gamey" for my tastes.  I couldn't make the connection to realism and victory conditions.

But in this one, the debate aspect has you fighting with your partner, and then you work together during the theater placement to go smack the other team.  The level of inter-team screwage is easier to connect and you understand that it is factions within the same team fighting for the greater glory and sometimes they do cut off their nose to spite their face while working together to prevent an instantaneous defeat, yet not working together for the greater common good, lest it make the other guy better (think of how managers at businesses operate and you can see it clearly).

The method of moving between war and peace and still having a fun game when you are NOT at war is something you don't see every day.  The wood pieces doesn't make you think "Euro" in the slightest.  The combat works.  This is a tough topic to game with a CRT and odds-based combat, so Mark Herman pulls it off in a way that is logical without being complicated.

This has levels and levels to explore.  I can see a player having to play this numerous times to have the level of proficiency of, say, For the People or Fire in the Lake, or Washington's War.  This game is not going to reveal its secrets in one play.  It is an investment game, so you can play and play and play and get your money's worth.

This is NOT Churchill on a new map.  You can see how Churchill influenced it (debate and war management), but this goes to an entirely different direction.  If you have Churchill, I wouldn't say learn it first to help you understand this, because it really will not.  Pick your favorite and jump in first.

As much verbiage as I have spoke about this game, it frustrates me because I can't tell you just how cool this game is.  Heck, I don't think I even understand how cool this game is.  I just feel it deep down in my bones and I marvel at it.  I make it a habit of not rating a game 10 until I get enough plays of it to understand it on a deeper level.  This baby is going to take a heckuva lot of plays to get there, but I will be surprised if it stays at the 9 forever.  It's just a matter of time, and since I don't have 3 other gamers to play this with, I'm going to have to wait for the next convention.

I happen to have played a sort of social interaction/inclusion game at a school camp, which included two participants each having one of their legs tied together, and then having a race between other teams of two each with their legs tied together. The resultant race can only be described as a painful exercise in team coordination, as the tie rips at your shins and you and your partner rush each other on. Imagine adding the goal of only one person on each team counting as the winner. The result would probably look even more silly, with teamplayers purposefully sabotaging each other, possibly to the detriment of the whole team, to gain ahead. 

This is a pretty good estimation of how Pericles plays. Two-player teams each vie for control of Greece and each player in the team battle it out over who gets to be the director of their faction, broadly speaking. The gameplay is an exercise in frustration, especially if your team are poor coordinators, but frustration has never been this much fun. 

It has some similarities with Churchill, the predecessor in Mark Herman's Great Statesmen series, with the big, obvious difference being that  Churchill had 3 players on the same team and Pericles has 2 teams of 2. The gameplay is likewise more complex and fiddly. Frankly, very fiddly. But if you can ride the frustration, you're gonna have a great time. I'm inclined to prefer Pericles more, because I enjoy the team-interaction more and the game has much more strategic depth, having a more sandbox-y theater-map, rather than Churchill's front tracks. After only two plays, I'll admit it's too early to tell, but I am eager to play this again.

Brilliantly devised, deep deep and fresh handling of the Pericles theme, but beyond fiddly in its complexity with (at least on the surface) esoteric systems that all feed into each other in ways that are far far too exhausting to try and manage alone, let alone with a minimum of four other players for it to run on all cylinders.

Churchill was darn near a 10. This took Churchill and added so much more that it took away almost everything that made Churchill brilliant. 

It was a 10. Then I played more, and it dropped to 8. I expect that 6.5 is where it will stay. This seems like a personal labor of love that shows so much promise and so much zeal for the theme that I went in expecting greatness and instead got greatness in design but an Ishtar level execution of that design.

Rating is based on one solo play. I play a lot of solo games, and prefer always heavy games over others. Played plenty of times mage knight, through the ages. Played enough splotters, gaia project, and a lot of what don’t caome upt o mind now. But, wow this is a beast. I don’t know what it is. Maybe I am not that used to wargames and I just don’t get the logic all the times. But my guess is, it is because of the way the rules are presented. There are just to many questions unresolved for me. Especcialy the way how the bots works. And then trying to manage 3 bots. It’s just to much of bookkeepping. I’m spending to much time for managing the bots instead of making up a strategy for my own.

Soon I will play this with a group of experienced wargamers. I expect that my rating wil get a boost. Because I guess this game will just be a blaat to play with four. But for soloplaying it won’t get my first pick. I Will play through all the scenarios also solo, mainly for the narative. As an history teacher, I’m very interested in the background story. It’s like reading a book. Fantastic. And I just hope that after several games my handling with bots wil get better, so I also can enjoy the solo gaming experience.

Much closer in play 'feel' to a COIN game than to Churchill. Players The teams
need to work to achieve a side victory, but compete within that side. More
to do 'on the board' than in Churchill. 

This one also seems to nicely incentivise actions (such as peace) which are not
well represented in other games covering the topic. Moreover, it doesn't give have 
an equivalent to the 'last scoring card' problem that the COIN series shows (which
bothers me, although it may not technically be a problem), while remaining very
competitive right to the end.

This one is tricky to rate. The concept is fantastic: Two rivaling factions that still have to work together somehow to not lose the war. However, compared to Curchill, this focuses heavily on the combat aspect. The learning curve is huge. There are so many options, but I often have the feeling that the results are overall not too interesting and that the game feels pretty much alike every time I played it. 
So after three games, I´m still not sure what to think of it, and I´ll definitely give it another shot.

Im on recording as being pretty disappointed with Churchill, but Mark Herman always does such interesting - if not always successful - games that I'll probably find it hard to just stay away from it. I was watching people play at GMT West and the 2 on 2 co-opitive model seems a lot more promising than Churchill's 3-way competitive model. 

I will say a lot of people who played it said they found the LIFO issue resolution to be extremely confusing and unintuitive.

Anyway, I'm curious to give this a try, although I'm not going to buy it.

OK, this one stimulates a number of pleasure centers at once, so I'm going to be more fulsome in my praise than I usually am for a first outing: this is a damn impressive piece of work, and one that is clearly a labor of love for the designer.

The quicky rundown: the game is a 2 vs 2 pseudo-team conflict where the players represent one of two notional political factions in Athens or Sparta. The winning side is the player who has accumulated the most Honor (read: VPs) in the Polis that has prevailed in the eponymous Wars (read: the city whose two factions have the highest combined Honor.) And there's your central tension: you need to cooperate with the other faction in your city to ensure your Polis sees its enemies driven before it and hears the lamentations of their women but not [i]so[/i] much that that other faction gets all the glory from the driving and the lamentations and the whatnot.

The meat of the game is divided: the first part is a card-driven intra-Polis debate over the actions you will take, in the form of a tug-of-war of chits along a number line. Agenda items that fall on your side of the zero point are yours to control during the next part of the game. Agenda items that fall exactly at zero? You don't get to act. You get bonuses for prevailing in these debates but if both sides are going to all out to win every single debate, you're going to end up with a bunch of things you don't get to act on. Governmental gridlock is a very real threat.

The second part pivots to the map of Greece and environs, and you will take it in turns placing chits corresponding to the issues you won in those debates on spaces on the map, then take it in turns to flip up those chits and take the appropriate actions. Another clever bit, which some people [i]hate[/i] for some inscrutable reason, is that these chits are resolved on a last-in-first-out basis, so the placement of the chits involves quite a bit of bluff and paranoia -- you THINK you know where the opposing faction is planning their devastating attack and you put a token on top of theirs to get some reinforcements there first, but maybe the token they put there is a bluff and then they put a token on top of that that is their devastating attack, and so on.

This game isn't for everyone (what game is?) but Pericles is loaded with beef -- fun period-specific chrome, which is appealing to anyone who slogged through Thucydides in college, and can now pleasantly discover that it's a useful hint book. Political wrangling without the baroque complexity of a Republic of Rome. Tons of scenarios to tailor the experience to your available running time. And a wide-open sandbox design that resembles the COIN series games but is more fluid and less tit-for-tat. I need to savor this one more -- in an ideal world I would find a group that was committed to really exploring this one. But I think this could be one of the greats.

Feb '18: Not sure what I think of this one, After being confused about a few rules during the first two thirds of the game, I've got a few issues with it. It feels very much like the Spartans stick to land (with the tough land units) and the Athenians stick to the sea (with tough sea units), with very little reason to cross into each other's territories. If you looked at our game board at the beginning and finish of the game five hours later, you'd probably have thought we'd been at it for 15 minutes. Not particularly satisfying, although the political side of things were novel to me, so I'll leave this at a 5 for now.

Components: really good components
Complex: lot of rules, but everything flows from the first turn
Weight: heavy
Players: 4, only 4
Length: from 3 hours would I say
Mechanics: wargame, voting, area control....
Decisions: think all you want, and far beyond
Opinion: this game is delicious, just delicious.
First of all, the theme is very appealing for me, I love this period.
In the game we have 4 players, 2 playing with Sparta and 2 playing with Athens. It's a teams game, but with only one player as winner. I think my comments will be shorter than expected.
If you understand the idea of just only one player winning, you have the concept of the game. Here you have to cooperate with your mate (remember this is a team), but keeping in mind that you have to have more honor than he at the end of the game. And the game does it in an amazing way, on the politics phase you decide how many actions your team will have on the next phase (important who of the team is leading that action for the points), so it is important that you get as much as you can, but... who will have the majority here? they are points
Then, in the action phase you will place these actions decided previously on the board (last in first out) so you can delay the actions of your rivals. Will not enter on these actions, but there are wars, traitors, your colleagues from the league.... and the one leading this action is the one getting the points.
I think this is the game, we can go in detail about what actions give honor, how to take them from your mate and take advantage.... but what really amazes me is how the game shows all explained above.... 2 Teams, just 1 player wins

RATING: 10
I've never given a 10 rating before and swore I never would (no game is perfect) but I'm loving this game. Best new design I've played in years. I have a keen amateur interest in the Peloponnesian War and the game's themes and strategic demands resonate strongly with my understanding of the conflict. The game's key tension between the political and strategic theatres is deeply engrossing and challenging and I'm still discovering new and surprising layers of thematically appropriate, emergent strategy, even after multiple plays. It takes a few plays to see the design intent through the abstraction but once there, it's brilliant. Destined to become a classic. I may drop my rating to a sensible 9.5 after many more plays and the shine wears off, but no prospect of that yet.

RATING: 9
A brilliant, innovative and intriguing game that is also very hard to wrap your head around until you've really immersed yourself in it - a fact that is unfortunately made worse by a dense and non-intuitive rule book. In other words: this is not a game for casual gamers or people just starting to explore the "heavier" part of the gaming spectrum. However, if you're an experienced gamer and looking for something new and different, this game will keep you occupied for years, if not a lifetime. 

The system is built on the Churchill logic but far exceeds it when it comes to complex, interacting layers of gameplay. Politics and warfare intertwine in an almost dizzying way to create a truly unique experience that is pretty hard to pin down; I will need to play much, much more to be able to provide a coherent description of what Pericles actually does. Can't wait for the next session.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Tentative rating. The systems are all smooth, and the intra-city fighting is neat. Internalizing what to do on the board (and what issues to fight about so as to influence the board properly) is very tough to internalize, though, and the solitaire system (while excellent) doesn't help teach you this very well--it mostly just engages in brute-force tactics and smashes things.

Still reading the rules on this one, but it does appear to be a really neat game about government and the theaters of war during the time period.  It appears that the 4 players will be busy with strategy of card play, debate issues, and the military side of things with little down time.  I am excited to see how this title plays out.

This is nothing short of a game changer.. i'm reluctant to give it a 10 after just one play but i predict this will be a straight 10.
This is not for the faint hearted, because of its high complexity and a few unusual (and very innovative) mechanics.
This game is tough decisions constantly..! You seriously hold a knife to your allies throat while making plans on how to best beat the enemy.

RATING: 5
Very ambitious design with great ideas which has sooo many issues:
- the entry barrier is HUGE.  Plenty of rules (think 'Churchill' and multiply it by, say 3) and a lot of effort required to digest them and transform into a conscious play
- playing time (reported 6-8h).  Note: scenarios can come to the rescue and auto-win is a viable option too. 
- fantastic system of haggling over issues and capturing them for your side/faction (invented in 'Churchill') doesn't work here at all.  Zero tension and zero interesting decisions.  It could've been skipped here altogether and replaced with a more or less fixed set of issues for each side during each turn
- way too much chrome - some rules could really be cut out without any sense of loss (specific pawns, Persia's influence, peace with this island in the bottom right hand corner, specific one-time issues, brain trust, hostages etc.) or greatly simplified (types of routes and the ways how you can travel through them or completely RIDICULOUS, absurdly overblown system of taking losses in battles).  Alternatively, some more advanced rules could be placed in an 'advanced variant' section.  Even without them there is a lot to absorb...
- you need exactly 4 players... yeah, you can play with bots, right :-/  It's easier to gather 3 for 'Churchill'...
- and the last but not the least important objection: INSTANT fun you get from Churchill is nowhere to be seen here... 

The bottom line is: THIS IS NOT 'CHURCHILL' set in ancient times.  In fact, both games have VERY little in common.
In 'Churchill' your foucs is equally distributed among winning issues on conferences and advancing fronts of WWII.
In 'Pericles' the fight for issues is basically skippable and the whole game transpires on the map where you can perform many diplomatic and miliatry manoeuvres.  And while interesting and challenging they share absolutely NOTHING with actions on the 'Churchill' map.

'Great Statesmen' series under which both games are advertised is a forced and misleading identity.

To me - 'Pericles' should be stripped of unneccessary elements (esp. this whole bargaining for issues part), well streamlined and sold as an indpendent, very fresh game offering the mixture of diplomacy and conflicts during the Peloponnesian War.  But the designer - an expert on antiquity - got carried away... and there it is - a not-quite-charming colossus.

Sold.

I have been enjoying "Pericles" since it first arrived in April 2017, and I rate the game a 10 - "Outstanding - will always enjoy playing" per the BGG rating scale.  I have described the game to my friends as a "lifetime" game that we can play for the rest of our lives and we'll always finds interesting and unique insights about the game and the Peloponnesian War every time we play it.  Not only that, I think the game is a seminal work of scholarship on the Peloponnesian War and I'm going to make a bold prediction, just as we do now 2,400 years after Thucydides wrote his book on the Peloponnesian War, in another 2,400 years from now, way out there in 4417, people will still be studying Thucydides to learn about the war, and they will also still be studying Mark Herman's "Pericles" to learn about the war in a dynamic and interactive way that adds perspective and insight beyond what can be learned by only reading the book!  "Pericles" is a game for the ages providing us a window into the past!

I was hoping that Pericles will be better than Churcill. 

Instead it removed most fun aspect of Churchill (three way "negotiations") and added operations phase. Which we have not enjoyed at all. 

I know that it is strategy game, but I do not like that game does not factor in any way weather during sea traveling. I do not like LIFO, I do understand what it should do, but for me it changes  game into strange combination of oponent guessing and acconting.

I could probably go on on this. Instead I will say that this game was big dissapointment for me and my friends (only 1 person from 4 quite liked it).

Played it solo using [i]Formio[/i] for the co patriot and [i]Brasidas[/i] for the enemy city state. Rating of 6 is based on solo mode, following flow charts isnt my cup of tea although they are well written but i m getting headaches after 2 hours (per day for 3 days in a row) of trying to find out the enemy movements (same case was for [thing=62227][/thing]) . Furthermore for the same amount of time that i soloed Pericles i could play other games (like MK) and have 10 times more fun. 
I m sure that for 4 players this will be a blast but as a solo game, nope, thank you but i ll pass...
1st edition rulebook and mainly the playbook have too many errata's and up to this date (February 2018) there isnt any living rulebook/playbook and i had to made corrections with pencil in the books so i could play my first game. 
I wanted to like this so much and i ve tried hard reading the rules many times, watching playthrough videos for hours and dedicating my self (and mind) to this boardgame with a univercity lesson/style approach but reality is the ultimate judge and pass is the verdict..
Solo disappointment of the year for sure...

For some reason Churchill didn't initially grab my interest.  I think I am too interested in the military aspects of the Second World War to want a game at a much greater level of abstraction (no matter how good the game).  But I caved in anyway and ended up liking it ...

With Pericles my ignorance of the Peloponnesian Wars is vast, both militarily and politically.

This fills in some of the enormous gaps in my knowledge (I am reading Thucydides to fill in some others), and it seems like a pretty nifty game system too.  A different take than COIN on four player military/political conflict.

The game plays like it should:  it has a distinct wargame feel, but the politics is still central.  Often the politics in wargames is something of a token piece of chrome.  And the military aspects of political games even more so.

But in Pericles both are equally important, in different ways at different times.

Was.a lot of work to learn.  The mechanics don’t seem so hard once everything fits into place, but it is a very procedure-heavy game.  Although there is a lot of history I felt the complex mechanics overwhelmed the “wargame essence” for my taste.

RATING: 7
Interesting mix of political bargaining, which then impacts on the tokens which can be played on the main map.  If debates are tied then that team will have less tokens to play on the map, and hence less actions to take, which can lead to massive swings.  Requires a lot of coordination to avoid this, and the right timing to block out your team mate to seize victory.

Complexity and rules overhead means I realistically wouldn't solo it.  Annoying little movement restrictions are an example of rules bloat which appears to be historically accurate, but unnecessarily complicates things.  Prefer a simpler ruleset.

Another great game from the mind of Mark Herman. This is my first ancients game. I continue to get beat up by the Phormio bots, even without any handicap honor points in place.

[i]Pericles is a four player 'sandbox' design that covers the period from 460 BC to 400 BC. The players each represent one of two Athenian or Spartan factions. The game has a political and a war phase. During the war phase the players are US versus THEM. During the Political Phase it is ME versus YOU (Athenian faction versus Athenian faction and Spartan king versus Spartan king).

The City State (Athens or Sparta) that gains the most Honor wins the war and the faction on the winning side with the most Honor wins the game.

There are over twenty scenarios that cover portions of the war with playing times from 30 minutes (mini Theater scenario), 45 minutes (6 years of the war), 90 minutes (a decade of war), and then there are the three long scenarios that cover the 1st Peloponnesian War, 2nd Peloponnesian War plus the Campaign game. There are rules for 3 player, 2 player, and solitaire play.[/i]

For anybody to rate a game a "10" (see his comment below) just because they like the designer's other games - without having played this one - makes me want to rate this game a "1". 

I will play the game first, you see, and then rate it. See how that works?

Spiritual successor to Churchill in the "great statesmen series" (mostly carrying over a variant of the conference system). Much more of a traditional "wargame." 4 player format pitting competing factions on the same side against the other team adds a lot of tension and potential for skullduggery. 

Hasn't sunk its teeth into me quite the same way Churchill did, but this is certainly another great game by Mark Herman. Looking forward the the "Paris 1919" installment.

Brilliant work of design, mechanics simulate historical aspects in an outstanding, innovative way. How the political debate resonates in the military theaters, how the "last in, first out" creates this kind of chaos that is expected in the military logistics of the period, the delay in transportation and communications... the work of a genius, embedded in good, sound historical background.

Based on a late play test in Alexandria. Combines the best aspects of Churchill with those of triumph and tragedy along with a cool event resolution, but being dealt a good hand is too determinative of success, rather than doing cool stuff on the board.

Zweifelsohne ein Klassiker, eine perfekt gelungene Mischung aus Euro- und Wargame, besser noch als die bisherigen Spiele der COIN-Serie. Nicht unbedingt leicht spiel- bzw. erlernbar, aber jede Partie bleibt in Erinnerung. In gewissen Grenzen vermag das Spiel sogar die Thukydides-Lektüre zu ersetzen.

RATING: 9
I don't want to call this a masterpiece but it is certainly a game that gives me a lot of joy. There are some elements that I am extremely fond of - for example, the control of main sides has been divided between two players competing for the same resources to enforce their decisions in the game. It is not a game about a perfect control of one side and it does show nicely the internal divide present in ancient Greek city-states.

There is a healthy (I would say) dose of abstraction and the game does not bog down with important but often tedious (from the game perspective) historical minutiae.

I really like it and I thoroughly enjoy the fact that I can play that game even with bots. It is more than just "play the other side to the best of your ability".

I am still learning how to play the system efficiently but it is a fun journey. There is a certain "lean-ness" in the rules. In other words, I feel like any superfluous elements of the game, if they have ever been there, were removed and so the "meat" remains.

The only possible complaint that I may have would be the initial learning curve and the rule book which many players with whom I had played find not quite easy to process. Mr. Mark Herman, why, oh, why  do you create such innovative and intricate designs? :D

The map seems very limiting at the beginning as does the mandatory land- or sea-first battles in the theaters. The richness of the debates, infighting while trying to beat a common enemy, and Aristophanes cards adding certain goals for each side to pursue are quite cool, though. Where and when to stack action chits is perhaps the most fascinating of the sub-games here. But it's also heavy-handed. 

Notes recently sent to a friend:

Pericles is heavy, but you won't find it too heavy, and I was playing with three other bright people, so we did fine with it after the first turn where there was a snail's pace and some discussion. I think it will solitaire alright with some creativity, but I think that about almost any game, so beware. The debating's really the only tricky bit mechanically with solitaire, but there must be a way, plus he provides a bot (not that I would use it). It's somewhat fun, this game, but some situations, like certain spaces being land battles first or naval battles first, no exceptions, before other battles can take place is restricting. You might consider watching a video or two on it before you take the plunge. I'm not sure if I'll keep my copy or not. It is intriguing, it is somewhat fun, but but but...

Pericles as a wargame. Well, it's much more of one than Churchill. You have naval and land troops, which fight in naval and land battles respectively. Add bases, which count for either. Treachery chits also add to the space's combat factors, as do strategoi, which count as a strength point and can also bring in units from other spaces as long as you don't have a minority of strength in that space when you leave it. Each side also has a special unit, a land unit for Sparta, a naval unit for Athens. You add all of this stuff up, flip a card for each side (1-5) and that's the total for the battle. Losses are taken in a somewhat complex, but understandable, way and there is no CRT. You can watch Herman's 50 to 60 minute video to watch combat in action. 

I don't know. It's kind of a wargame, but not overly tactical. Check out the rulebook or tables. 

What bugged me about Pericles you've already read, but the Aristophanes cards turned each turn add random goals for each side to complete, the debates can be rich with a number of options of which actions to pursue via chit, and the in-fighting vs. fighting the common enemy can likely produce a lot of tension, but perhaps more so when playing with a group depending on how much you like to stab at yourself while playing solitaire.

RATING: 9
Placeholder rating of 9 based on BGG's recommended system of scoring based on how much I want to play it, and right now not surprisingly, it's a lot.

Preliminary impressions.: I realize that Pericles is not COIN, but I came to Pericles through COIN, so comparisons are inevitable. 

One thing I really like so far over COIN is the solo system, COIN's system is constructed with a heavy strategy of "Dog pile on the human!" By contrast Pericles "Phormio" system tries to implement a broad strategy consistent with the conditions on the board and acts more in character so to speak, so Athenians will act like Athenians, Spartans like Spartans, etc. Also, since the COIN bots are all directed to challenging the human, there is a sense that deviating from the microscopic details of the flowchart feels like cheating. With the Phormio bots there is more of a sense of freedom to override its decisions when you discern that it is making a boneheaded play. In short, it's more narrative friendly, so if you are like me and are driven more by interacting with the story than beating the game, advantage goes to Pericles.

I also prefer the combat here. One of the charges I've heard leveled against COIN is that they are "Wargames without war" as one faceless, disposable group of cubes displaces another. I see the point, but I think the real issue is that it seems that there is usually a more optimal Operation than combat out there and, more importantly, combat results at best only have an indirect effect on the score. In Pericles combat is direct and the stakes are high. Big battles potentially yield big scores and while it's still cube vs. cube, there's more drama as the game hangs in the balance.

In COIN's favor I would say that in those games the board is a gorgeous map of the conflict area whereas Pericles is a gorgeous map with a bunch of boxes slapped over top of it. I get that this is convenient as the routes from one place to another are a bit more complicated than in COIN and that a straight-up map would be hard to play on, but when you place a green cylinder in the Mekong Delta it evokes a sense of a sweaty band of SOG operatives snoopin' and poopin' in Charlie's playground. In Pericles it can come off more like cube hopscotch at times, but this is a minor quibble.

I know of no other game like this. It is one of a kind. After playing through the learning scenarios I know I have so much more to understand for skill and strategy. It doesn't open its secrets to you right away as it is not your typical cardboard pusher. Solo play is outstanding and we'll thought out. Player vs player is a game of intrigue and impacts. You will plan you may conquer or you may fail depending on how smart you are with resources, timing and sheer luck at times. Beautiful components and it historically captures all we know about this massive conflict. I will always enjoy putting this on my table.

RATING: N/A
Looks very promising. I ran through the intro political phase scenario with a friend and he talked me through some of the basics. It seems to take the things I like from Churchill and improve upon them, and then remove the things I didn't like entirely. To reference, I didn't particularly like Churchill (settled on a 6/10 rating).

Churchill was a (players vs. players) vs. system game. Pericles is a (player vs. player) vs. (player vs. player) game. I really didn't enjoy the "system" portion of Churchill. It felt procedural, clunky, and bloated. Pericles seems to scrap the system and just focus on the players (Unless you're playing with less than 4, which I assume I wouldn't enjoy nearly as much- solo might work though). 

I look forward to exploring this one greatly. Exploring the balance of the in-fighting vs the external battles looks fantastic.

Highly complex, very thematic game. Fortunately, things are explained rather clearly (for the most part) - there's just a lot thrown at you (e.g., Honor is the path to victory if your side wins the war, and there are count 'em 18 different Honor adjustments in the game!). 

Familiarity with Churchill won't help much (this is more of a wargame than Churchill). Taking it slowly...

Pericles is a backbreaking design, both infuriating in its complexity and breathtaking in its smartness. More dynamic than its predecessor Churchill, both of its halves — the assembly at home and the war with your rival city-state — echo back upon one another in myriad ways, resulting in one of the most frustrating and rewarding sandbox games ever crafted.

Pericles is a truly unique design. I probably haven’t played anything this innovative since Churchill (also a Mark Herman design) which says a lot. The political competition felt less tense than the struggles against the opposing city state during my games. This is a game with an active military theater in lieu of the status tracks in Churchil. Overall these games are distinctly different. As a wargame, I appreciate having a teammate with which to coordinate efforts. There aren’t distinctly unthematic/gamey incentives at play. Honor can shift quickly in battle. I’ve seen leads that looked quite insurmountable evaporate with thoughtful redeployment and careful placement of orders. 

Despite the capability to play with less than four players, I would never recommend it. The phormio AI may suit some players, but the negotiation component of this game is an essential part of my enjoyment. Overall, it’s a very good game, but difficulty teaching it to new players means it likely won’t make it to the table very much. I would advise starting with the 2 full turn scenario. My first game with four new players took about 3 hours. My second game was a full five turns (6-10) and took about 4.5 hours with players that had played before. The variety of scenarios makes length a non-issue, but those times were what I experienced.

Interesting follow-up on "Churchill", which takes the political arena issues of that game and adds a competition element between the two two-player teams of Athens and Sparta. Certainly innovative, but it feels bloated and fiddly in comparison to its predecessor. Incredibly draining and exhausting, probably after having some experience it could be less taxing to play, but as it is now I don't care too much to revisit it.

This is an excellent successor to Mark Hermans classic Churchill.  This is a brilliant game with a refreshing take on the realities of democracies at war.  I found on my first turn playing as the Spartans our theatre phase crippled due to a near dead lock in the senate.  It's all wonderful stuff, it requires a good deal of thinking and deciding where you can afford to lose political fights to win the military fights, and finally when do you backstab your teammate if you are in the winning position.

I wont lie though, this is a complex game, much more complex than Churchill.  I didn't have too much trouble but I did spend a week reading the rules and ran a full solo turn before unleashing this on my friends.  The Training gymnasium of tutorials does help ease you into the game.

This is a real gem of a game but Mr. Herman does not spoon feed you fun and will make you work for it, but if your are willing to put in the work he will reward you with a unique experience.

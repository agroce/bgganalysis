First Play: Had rules explained and launched in after about 20 mins. Once you join the dots, this is a clever and quick game and with experienced players could be classed as a filler, all wrapped up in 45min to an hour. We took 90 mins with the rules explanation.

Whats clever is the opportunity to persue other avenues if one player domm=inates one aspect of the game. At game end it came down to a tie break with the other two players only 1 point off.

I look forward to playing again. However with different money. The notes are truly horrible and should be burnt.

Others say: mechanical, overly convoluted worker placement game, fairly straightforward auction followed by trading/optimizing, not an innovative design, resource collection & shipping, not as good as Peloponnes or Ad Illa Ect, lots of mechanics that don't gel together, obvious choices (and clearly stupid choices that no one picks since a few VP paths seem weak or non-viable such as the "Path to Intrigue"), non-intuitive, feels somewhat unrefined, must keep referencing rulebook, bad components (pawns & money), no real choices, no turn angst, very little competition, unlike many Euros you start with a decent money engine so you don't have to spend the first half of the game building your economy (as you do in most Euros).

(Played at Spiel 2010.) A variation on the workerplacement genre of boardgames: instead of managing a small number of workers the players are now managing a fleet of 18 workers. Some of these will take up residence in places from where they cannot be removed, causing a bit of long term tension in the entire game. Overall, I found this game not particuarly engaging; and perhaps more damaging, not illustrative of the reasons why the author was so impressed with the managing skills of ancient Carthage to keep the harbour running smoothly. I was given to understand that this was the inspiration for Porto Carthago, and it comes as a disappointment to notice that the result lacks these interesting historical facts about Carthage's port. 

Porto Carthago in some remote way reminds me of Leonardo da Vinci, which has a similar game feel. Mechanically both games work, and probably rather good a that, but there aren't many interesting decisions to make, and at the end you're (well, [i]I[/i] am, in any case) left with a [i]that's it?[/i] feeling which does not entice you to play the game again anytime soon.

What a let-down. To me this was just another soulless euro which is sad as I really like some of the designers other games and had high expectations.

To make matters worse it wasn't even exciting. No turn angst, no competition to speak of, no really interesting choices, no real resource management. With five players it took us almost 2½ hours to play four turns which was way too long.

The rating might be a bit harsh, but I have no real interest in ever playing this game again.

Players represent harbour masters or merchants, trying to earn a profit and purchase influence at the palace.  Players on their turn scan the horizon to spot the shipping coming into Carthage, and send their workers scurrying around the board to do stuff.  Down to the docks to load ships, portaging goods around Carthage, hiring ships or off to the temple to ensure Baal looks after the voyage across the Mediterranean.   When ships depart, trade points are accumulated, and money earned.  Both of these things are used to place pawns in the palace, and most pawns at the end of the game wins you the game.  Good solid stuff, well presented (apart from the flimsy money and cylindrical, spotty pawns), that plays well.  You need to plan ahead and get your moves optimized to do well, and pay attention to the Path of Righteousness (or whatever it was called - the sneaky way into the palace) - that's where the winner is going to come from!  Nice game, but probably a little lost in the great game flood of 2010/2011.  I liked the other games from the designer, Pelopponnes /Alea Iacta Est, more than this one.

RATING: 8.5
Ez is 9  felé hajlik, addig is míg döntök: 8.5. 
A Peloponnes után újabb játéka a szerzőnek, de míg az egy családi játék inkább, ez már komolyabb. Nem is a 60-90-es játék idő miatt, hanem az összetettsége miatt.
Nekünk persze első parti 3 órás volt, de sok egyéb ok is hozzájárult ehhez, valójában bőven 2 óra alatt lehet hozni még 5 fővel is.
Ugyanakkor végig izgalmas volt, nem dőlt el semmi.
Sok út, sok lehetőség, sok apró részlet.
Egyik tanulság, h érdemes figyelnie annak, akinek esélye van rá, h esetleg már a 4. dekád végén befejezze a játékot: az utolsó dekád csúnya változtatásokat is hozhat.
A másik, amit nem figyeltünk annyira: a kikötőkbe úgy áruk pakolása, h még nincs ott hajó: ilyenkor gyakorlatilag a forduló kezdetekor (behajózáskor) juthat az ember, még a többiek előtt, bevételhez, kereskedői ponthoz, és ugye ne felejtkezzünk el a kiváltságokról sem.

Amúgy a játékszabály alapvetően nem túl bonyolult: mindig ugyanabból a 6 akcióból választhatunk, csak hát nem mindegy, h mennyiért.
a kereskedés nagy trükkje: h akció körön belül csökken az áru ára, de újabb akció körben -ugyanazon dekádon (fordulón) belül- már újra a régi ár.
És hát a játék cél: nem a pénz: hanem a palotában minnél nagyobb befolyás szerzése: azaz minnél több ember ide pakolása, ami persze pénz kérdés , de csak IS: mert h ahogy egyre több bábu lesz itt, úgy nem csak drágább lesz a bevásárlás, hanem egyre növekvő alapfeltételnek is meg kell felelni: a kereskedési pontokkal kell rendelkezni.

Összesítve ez egy sokkal komolyabb játék, összetett, de talán nem túl bonyolult, izgalmas, jól kitalált. Megfelelő játékidővel, sok módszerrel, lehetőséggel.
Alapvetően szép, és minőségi tábla, a kártyák szépek, jól eltaláltak, a doboz lehetne picivel masszívabb.
2 bajom van vele:
egy a pénz kártyák nekem nem tetszenek
illetve nekem a fa bábuk némelyike is sorjás.
de ez alapvetően nem befolyásolja a játékélményt azért.

RATING: 5
We're fans of Peloponnes but this one didn't come together for us.  While some ideas in the game had potential like the action card market values that change each round, the overall experience resulted in less than the sum of its parts.  It seemed to play pretty slow and I'm not sure multiple plays would improve speed of play much.  The Path of Intrigue seemed more like a Path of Avoidance as the Trading House was deemed much more valuable.  It's a big gamble for the first player to commit because if no one else goes in you have to spend three pieces (that you don't get back) just to get one piece on the score track at the end of the game.  We all thought you shouldn't have to reach the first point space to activate scoring; having a majority up to the that space would be suffice & encourage players to use this part of the board.

I was going to play this once, but after listening to the rules I had a strong feeling that this was not a game I wanted to play.  There were 5 of us, and it seemed to me that the game would be better with fewer players, so I bowed out and let the other 4 play.  They told me after they finished that I made the right decision.

Porto Carthago is another variation on the worker placement mechanic. Instead of the usual "worker = action" formula, here you have a fixed number of actions available that you need different amounts of workers for.

Despite a couple of nice twists the main action of loading boats in the harbour is a bit uninspired, and the flipping of pirate ships is clearly reminiscent of the colonisation deck in Goa, something that hasn't exactly been met with universal appraisal.

Personally, I didn't quite like the very chunky scoring. There is very little sense of progress for most of what you do, and a lot of effort goes into necessary preparations for just getting into position for having the possibilty of maybe scoring one of the few VPs.

Classics revisited. A very generic design with generic theme and played in a generic way.

In spite of this I had a good time playing Porto Carthago - mainly because of the mix of two ideas: 1) every action costs you a specific number of your workers and your choice is not limited by other's choices and 2) the layout of the cards with special actions allows you to combine two actions at a time.

Definitely worth knowing. Especially if you can find it at a bargain price.

RATING: 5
Initial review after one play. Unfortunately, there's little desire to reassess. Bland worker placement Euro that once again has players racing to get things that convert into things that can be turned into VP, with special powers and combos along along the way. The randomness of the pirate card flips and each round's action track layout is enough to make me balk.

Nicely themed cargo-moving game, of the variety 'I never have enough actions...".  Micro-optimisation may lead to slow games, though given the random nature of the ship loading and market this should be pushed along.

In the first few games everything seemed fine, but then it broke down. I never saw it as a great game, but one with really nice mechanisms ans ideas. Sadly, it just doesn't feel well developed in more than one way. Even though it doesn't look this way at all, the few elements of luck can decide the whole game in both directions. Could have been much better!

RATING: 4
Completely superfluous Euro, another entry into the category of games that highly annoyed me on my single play and never will get played again. Perhaps not as bad as my rating makes it but life is not fair.

The main reason is the random card draw for the pirate ship that will decide the game against players having bad luck. Another annoying element is the random draw of the merchant goods. Given the close game end scores (ranging from 4-6 in our game) any unlucky draw can cost a point and there are not enough random elements to balance out over the game. Add to this a huge rules overhead for not enough depth and there's a stinker at hand. Another game that could have needed a professional developer and not a self-publisher.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Bad component quality on pawns and money, but apart from these the game looks and feels quite good. And it also plays well. There is lots of differing actions you can take each turn and sequencing your own actions and also sequencing them against the actions of your opponents is quite subtle. There's quite a lot of minor take that, but again, this is really subtle and not at all straightforward. There's also some luck included and even though the chance also seemed to be balanced it might ruin someone's play sometimes. In the end it's just about making money and turning this money into positions in the palace.

LIKE:

* The pirate implementation is interesting in this game as you flip a card and find out if the value is greater than the number of workers you have praying the temple.  However, all is not lost if pirates hit you but you still lose half your money from the ship and can only move your influence marker up one OR your intrigue marker one instead of the option to do both.
* VPs are based on the number of workers in the palace which means as you get workers into the palace, you have less to use.  
* The actions are the same each round but can and will change in cost as they are mixed up and redistributed on the cost track each round.  

DISLIKE:

* Paper money is horrible and feels like it won't last much more than a game or two.
* Instructions proved difficult to follow for my group and for this simple a game, should not be an issue.
* Game doesn't feel all that dynamic with little story arc and doesn't maintain interest.  There is a lot of doing the same thing over and over again and I prefer to play other worker placement games before this one.

First impression (4 players): The rules seem messy. Two players had read them and there were still many things we needed to (double)check during the game. Perhaps this is because many things just don't feel intuitive. Maybe because of this the game experience wasn't as good and my rating is what it is. 

Perhaps we missed the opportunity to make money simply by having plenty of guys at home to make basic income but with (just) 4 players there was a bit too much battling for harbour places and then to gain ships. There are the other boats but they are a bit random on how much they'll bring income and they bring less anyway and you still lose your good & boatsman even if you gain only half-income.

Also as the game ended in a threeway tie it felt perhaps a bit too tight.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A very pleasant surprise. Even though the majority-based end scoring scheme isn't very inspiring, there are lots of clever interconnections and timing issues elsewhere in the game.

Very poor component choices:
- The pawns are very unstable, and round, so you'll be collecting them from the floor all the time.
- The money in the game would fit on one counter sheet, but very thin paper money is used instead.
- The goods come in the same colors as the player pieces.
- Some people have reported having received a marked deck of cards but I haven't had this issue myself.

Porto Carthago falls into the category of perfectly okay game designs with decent art direction and quality production values that completely fail to excite me.

The rules are easy to understand, as are the paths to victory and each player's turn provide some interesting choices without AP. 

That said, the path of influence (the second of 2 options for gaining access to the palace/victory points needed to win the game) only has potential if multiple players choose to pursue it. Without that largely situational option, the game is balanced enough to keep VP's so even spread between the players that it feels like ultimate victory is granted to whoever shipped/loaded marginally higher cash-value ships during the game. While accomplishing this does require planning and skill, it isn't without it's share of luck.

Ultimately, that just doesn't feel like the goal of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
The game is a fairly straightforward auction followed by trading/optimising. I have doubts about these sorts of games because auctions when they are set up correctly are fundementally challenging as tactical problems but a lot of these games seem to swamp the central auction with loads of detail. I played once and saw this played a second time and the rules explanation took nearly as long as the game, which is odd given that the rules aren't that difficult. Probably just not quite aimed at the right level for what it is.

--Feb2011-- Finally got it to the table.  It's much more amusing than the early Essen reviews led me to believe.  Unfortunately for [i]Porto Carthago[/i], it's got a lot of moving parts - and it takes a little while both to explain and understand.  Once all is in motion, though, it's pretty nice.  In some ways, one sees the family resemblance with [i]Peloponnes[/i]:  that one, too, takes about half as long to explain as to play!

Clever euro, with lots of great little choices.  Lots of look ahead with a little bit of luck.  As usual with most modern euros, you have to know when to start sacrificing your economy and switch to Victory Points.  Fortunately here, it starts with everyone almost completely up and running rather than a protracted first half for people to get functional only to have the shift to VPs again.

Round bits are bad!

The money is ooky.

All in all though it's nice.  More importantly different enough to justify its existence (but it could be a bit shorter).

There are some interesting mechanics here, but the game fails on a number of levels. First of all, the slender wooden cylinder pieces are a terrible choice for a worker placement game. They show off every little production flaw and tend to fall over and roll off the table en mass. The paper money in the game is just awful, both in terms of graphics (the one, two, five and ten "dollar" notes don't have numbers on them ... you're supposed to count the number of coins pictured on the bill to see how much it's worth) and production quality (the notes are about as thick and as slick as a magazine page). In terms of game play, the system for introducing the goods into circulation is seriously flawed. In my first (and very likely last) game, I had workers at a dock with a ship seeking a "yellow" good. During the following four rounds, yellow was drawn just twice, including my spending three actions to clear and refill the goods hoping for a yellow one. I was unable to load a yellow good until the last turn of the game, and by then it was far too late. You see, the rich get richer in Porto Carthago. The people who successfully ship early not only get money and trade points, but they also get the bonus actions from the bottom of the ship cards which - surprise - help them ship successfully the next time. This is truly a game where the sum of the parts is far less than what, from a reading of the rules, would seem like a solid, albeit unimaginative, Euro-style trading game. A very disappointing experience.

RATING: 6
Portho Carthago had some interesting things going on... but it's a game that's designed so that everyone will be buying points at roughly the same rate. Which means the scores will be tight until the very end. 

What decided our game was the "path of intrigue" which pays out a point or two (or even three!) depending on who has the most markers committed to the path.  Which was also tied, three or four ways, and was broken in favor of who committed a pawn to that path earlier.  So if one of the other players had committed to the path earlier, there could have been two other people who could have claimed the win.  None of us had realized that the game would come down to who entered this track first... but it seems like it will decide the game on a regular basis.

Also, there's a way to ship goods to a random ship and you don't know if the value will be 1-6 before you try to ship, and your rewards are cut in half if you don't have enough markers in the temple to match the ship value.  In such a long, tight game, getting screwed on a card draw is a little disappointing. And finally, you can be really dickish if you have more markers in the lighthouse and screw people by sending the boats they want to the wrong place, or just telling one boat to go away.

Overall it wasn't horrible, but there's nothing really compelling about the game either.  The whole "keep everybody close in score" mechanic is one I'd rather not play to be honest.  I want to win a game because I did big things and came up with a grand strategy, rather than being slightly more efficient on one particular move, or getting the right turn order on one critical round.  Playing for a couple of hours just to have one small decision be the deciding factor is unfulfilling.

RATING: 4
Carthage – long before the deadly conflict with Rome.
During 5 decades, each a game round, players use their servants to earn income or position them to obtain goods and load the goods onto incoming merchant ships - or even take the risk of chartering a private vessel - all with the goal of buying influence in the palace. Influence in the harbor can also determine where the best ships will dock, and the path of intrigue can provide yet another way into the palace courts. Only the player who develops the best business - through any means necessary - will end the game as the most influential senator.

Bought this on a whim and wish I hadn't.  The implementation of the "push your luck" mechanic seems intriguing, but in practice is a failure.  There is just not enough freedom in this game to make any interesting decisions.  I don't mind games, such as Backgammon, where you work with the die rolls to build strategic positions or construct tactical ploys.  Unfortunately Foray! permits you to do neither.  Luckily the store where I bought the game is letting me return it...which I will do as soon as possible.

A love hate relationship. 

Great components, rules explanation, interesting dice. 

Roll the dice, step on someone to kill him or penetrate a fortress and return alive. So.....what's the fun in that again? 

Like a phrase we use here " go there, touch the wall and come back. " ...... Must be doing something interesting.....

It's ninjas and like them - this game presents one face and the rest hides in shadows.  The game is outlined as a light fun game about competing ninjas, but it is really an abstract game in ninja dress.  The nature of the die rolls can have a huge influence on the outcome.  As long as that is okay - you can find some enjoyment in the play.  Just remember to look over your shoulder from time to time,

I like the wooosh factor of superfast Ninas, that are faster than their own shadow.
You can play with everyone. and if your opponent likes the game you will spend hours with it. If they dont like it the game is over after a few minutes, so there is usually no harm done or time wasted.

Quick, fun press your luck game with just a touch of strategy.  Fun ninja "theme" for a game that is really just a light abstract.  Good one for my 7 y.o. son.
Edit:  My son now likes to play his own variant on the game where the object is to eliminate the other players.  The shadow ninja is used and has the added ability of eliminating any opposing ninja occupying a space 1 space orthagonally from where shadow ninja lands.  He has fun with it.

Simple game appropriate for children. Family fun but not a lot more. You roll 2d4 to determine which piece you move that many pieces each turn. "Oh no, I rolled a 4!" Or: "Yes, I rolled a 6!"

I probably like this game a lot more than I should, perhaps because I do not own it yet.  I cannot think of any flaws with NvN; it does everything it is supposed to do well and quickly.  The theme does not feel pasted on (note the two win conditions: you can either shame or eliminate your rivals), and more importantly, there are some exciting push-your-luck tactical decisions to make.  I never thought that I would enjoy a roll and move game so much.

This is lighter than most dedicated two-player games we own, being a light chess-style game with pawn capture and strict movement.

The main goal, to sneak into the opponent's dojo and get back out safely, is a minor but fun twist.

It plays fast, so a couple of rounds in a short evening are no problem.

[b]Rating based on - 5+ plays, 2 player[/b]
A simple 2 player only roll-and-move type game where you are trying to get points for infiltrating the other ninjas' dojo. There is a press your luck element as well because once you are on a mission, you only have 3 turns to get back to your own dojo! Do you want to venture deep into the other ninja's dojo and risk capture? Will the dice let you return home safely before you are caught? Very amusing to play and quite good fun. Also...adorable minis!

Houses the components to my PnP of Onitama which uses the ninja minis. 2 awesome games in one box!

RATING: 4.143
Actually - - It's not such a bad game!  Hardly the best, but very cute pieces, and something I would like to play with Stevie again - - almost a simple abstract.  Sure , with the dice there is a high luck element, but It's a short game, so that shouldn't be a problem. I like how there are two different paths to winning (get to 7 points or eliminate the other ninjas - - would normally be a 5 rating but the cute pieces raise this to a 7). (1/7/12). UPDATE: Son finds this too boring, and spinning the cute dice is annoying.  Game play on reflection is mechanical and uninspiring.  Alas, the nice pieces do not redeem the game (Rating 4.143, Dec 16). Gone (Jan 17).

Ninja Vs Ninja
MFG: Out of the Box
#of Players: 2
Age Range: 8 +
Overall Construction: I love the style of the artwork on this game. The ninjas, masters, & the dice are a rubberized plastic. The Dice are a bit on the weird side, as they are square with swords through the center of them. Sometimes it makes rolling them difficult. The board is a narrow tri-fold board with the same fun graphics on it. The rule book is easy to understand with plenty of graphics that will help you understand the game easily. Typical high end product from Out of the Box Games.
Gameplay: Ninja vs Ninja is a basic 2 player game where you are ninjas from opposing dojos. Your ninjas line up in the specially marked spaces in their dojo. Each player has a Master that goes on the scoring track and a Shadow Ninja that keeps track of how far you enter your opponent’s dojo. On a players turn, they will roll the dice and move forward that many spaces. You 2 more rolls to try to get into and back out of our opponent’s dojo. If you make it into the opponent’s dojo, move your Shadow Ninja to the space even with how deep you made it into the other dojo. To score you have to make it back to your dojo. The object is to score 6 points.
There are more rules and nuances to the game than I’ve listed here, but it is the basic idea. 
Yes/No Recommend: This is a fun, quick, and easy to learn board game. The components help make the game fun for all players. It may look like this will be an easy game, but you are rolling 2 - 4 sided dice which make the odds of getting there and back difficult. If you like chess this would be a nice change up for you with a high enough level of strategy to keep you entertained.
Where To Get It: This isn’t a newer game so you might be able to find a copy at your local game store, if not - see if they can order it for you, and since Out Of The Box Games is no longer in business – I’d say check your favorite online retailer.

Ninja versus Ninja is a tactical game for two players. It involves lots and lots of luck--maybe a bit too much luck for many people. Play is somewhat chaotic, as the rolls of the dice can stymie a plan or bestow a game-winning windfall. The rules are relatively simple and easy to grasp, and the components are cute and sturdy. Gameplay is short enough to make the randomness unimportant, but some skill and foresight are required. These elements add up to a game that should be fun for most kids while also being tolerable, or even enjoyable, for many adults. 

The experience is enhanced when the players engage their imaginations, for example pretending that they are trapped in a cheesy marital arts film. Overall, this is a good, light-weight filler-length game for the whole family.

Ninja vs. Ninja  is a great game due to its simple mechanics and fast game play times.

Plus the cute ninja playing pieces and neat looking dice help add to the fun.

There is quite a bit more strategy involved then you would think upon the first few plays. At first it seems like a pure dice roll game with more luck then strategy.

As you play more games you start to see patterns emerge with ninja positions that make it hard to have a ninja killed or move to block enemy ninjas from returning home in time.

Sometimes chipping away at the enemy dojo a point at a time can win you games. 

You can also win by killing all the other ninjas as well. Though I have won a few games with only one ninja left, running back from the enemy dojo to score the winning points.

A fun simple game with fast pace play and some subtle workable strategic mechanics that keep it from just being a luck of dice game.

I had thought it might be a light family game enjoyable by adults, but, having played it now with my 7-year-old nephew, I can safely say this is placed squarely in "kid's game" category.

Yes there's a lot of luck, but you can play the percentages to give yourself a slight edge, and more importantly you can fit in about 4 games in half an hour.  Luck- based games are fine by me if they play quickly and are still fun.  Which this one is, especially with the multiple paths to victory (missions vs. enemy elimination).

I appreciate the theme; I felt in a hurry when in the middle of an incursion into enemy territory; killing ninjas is quick and efficient (like really ninjas :).  Good children game.  Can be relaxing for adults.

Rugged pieces, quick to play, easy to learn. Games take 20 minutes at the most. Good if you want something more in-depth than Fluxx but less involved than Carcassonne.

Good 'silly' fun. It's less silly than it appears, but that's what makes it fun. I love the bits. This is the kind of game I would have played as a kid when we were breaking out chess, checkers, or backgammon.

I've since decided this is a children's game so I've removed my rating.

A clever enough game, but I suspect a limited replay value for people older than about 9. I got shown the game at GenCon 2009, and my then 10-year-old also felt it wouldn't stay interesting to him for very long. For kids maybe 7-9, however, it seems like it would be a good fit. The board and ninja pieces are excellent, and I even like the dice, which are narrow and elongated.

RATING: 6.75
Nice two-players abstract game in a nicely edited way. The figures give the game more dimension. It could also be made with coins on a board (which would have made it cheaper), But the idea of the Ninjas works commercially well.

This is a fast and simple filler 2-player game! The specialty dice, ninjas, and board are all top quality! Your mission is a simple one...sneak into enemy territory...go as far as you can and then get back to your own territory as quickly as you can. Try not to get killed along the way!

Waaay overproduced, especially since even the ninjas can not cover up it is really an abstract game.  That being said, I do like that the premise of the game is make the most of your luck.

RATING: 6
Played Ninja vs Ninja edition.  First off, this game is really well done.  The Ninja figures are great.  It is almost worth buying the game just for the bits.  Still, the game is a relatively light, quick dice game.  It is all right for what it is.  However, because of the dice, a lot of what you can and can't do, as well as can or can't be done to you, is completely out of your hands.  Because of this significant lack of control or ability to look ahead, the game feels really chaotic.  That doesn't seem quite wrong for two groups of ninja having it out with each other,  So overall, a pleasant enough experience.  [05/23/2009]

An abstract game with great little bits (Kovalic artwork for ninjas, cool dice). 

The board is divided into 2 grids (dojos) separated by a neutral zone. Each player has an equal number of ninjas. On your turn you roll 2d4 (cool ninja dice; d6 with a sword stuck through it that kills 2 sides) and move a ninja exactly that many spaces. That ninja can move only in a straight line, with one 90degree turn and/or a 180degree turn if in enemy dojo and headed straight ahead (end up heading back to your own dojo). Ending movement on an enemy ninja removes enemy from game. If you move a ninja out of your dojo, it's on a mission; if not back in home dojo by 3rd turn, it's removed from game. You get points by advancing ninja into enemy dojo and safely returning home; 1VP/row penetrated. Win by reaching 7VP first, or eliminating all enemy ninjas.

Ninja versus Ninja is a quick, tactical abstract. The components are awesome, but there's not much game here.

This game is obviously designed to appeal to children but the mechanics lend an edge to an adult who can plot odds based on likely dice rolls. This means there's a very small chance of a child beating an adult in the game (assuming the adult understands basic gaming tactics). If kids are playing each other, then I imagine this game is probably more enjoyable for all.

Your Ninjas must defend the honor of their dōjō against a rival dōjō. Victory hinges on eliminating Ninjas and skillfully venturing into the opponent’s dōjō. But how far do your Ninjas dare to go...and will they return? Every move is critical as you position your Ninjas for defense and ready them for their mission!

Prove yourself to be a worthy master with Ninja versus Ninja!

Nice little filler that feels like an abstract with a big "push your luck" factor. It also reminds me a little bit of StreetSoccer, but simplified and with streamlined rules. The little ninja figures (which are really cute), and the short playing time (approx 15 minutes) make this a worthwile addition to my collection. Still, some games feel completely luck-based (especially those that are finished by eliminating one side's ninjas).

For all my worries about whether strategy can trump chance in [i]Ninja versus Ninja[/i], perhaps a more important point is that I was willing to play the game ten times to attempt to answer that question. Random or not, the game is short and fun and has that "one more time" quality that good filler games do. Lose, and you're sure that the next game will play out better for you if only... Win, and you're happy to give the opponent another shot at you before moving on to something more engaging.

Quick and funny game. I think a deck of cards with all the probability of the dice + 1 wild card that players could choose from would have made that game more strategic, but it is such a light game that the randomness of the 2 dice (4 sides with numbers with a sword going through the 2 others side) is not a big deal.

Another game in the 'short 2P filler' category. This one is a nice take on the roll and move. While there is a minor bit of strategy here it really just comes down to die rolls. That's not totally a bad thing, just don't expect anything too deep.

That said, the theme and components make it enough for me to keep permanently in the collection.

I can't make my mind up about this. I really like some elements but others drag and although I want to like it, the trading aspect is very tedious and two of the games have degenerated into long, drawn out affairs. The mythology expansion adds more variety and fixes a few balance problems but doesn't resolve any of my reservations

Ancient Mediterranean Civilization game. The trading part is interesting, but seems a bit chaotic for something so pivotal to the game. I only played once, though, so maybe there's more to it.

We clearly aren't playing this right... first game short, and the trade phase wasn't conducted correctly (our bad). Pyramids went to Greece after five or six rounds (12 taxes).

RATING: 4
a '4' partly due to the dissapointment factor. Only played one 3-player game. My opponents found the resource cards 'fiddly' and their crankiness damped the experience a bit. But the problem I had with the game was that once all the market tiles were used there was still much of the board to be explored, but no reason to so the game stalled when it felt it only about halfway through.

Un "civilization ligth" mas corto, con una curiosa mecánica de comercio, se equilibra más con la expansión. Es un juego muy muy bélico y de mucho enfrentamiento constante, el metajuego tipo hablar con los jugadores para hacer o romper alianzas etc. es básico. No lo recomendaría a quien vaya con mentalidad de euro de "construir su civi" porque apenas eso es al principio del juego, luego enseguida es todo muy escaso y el juego te obliga a batallar.
A ver la nueva edición si mejora ciertas reglas y mecánicas y balancea todavía más el juego, a parte de la mejora de componentes. Porque el juego, básicamente es el mismo.

Very nice board and art. I was not so appealed by the gameplay. The rules try to be very synthetic and brief, but unfortunately they left some huge holes that make necessary to check the published FAQ too often. 
I tried it again and still though that it wasn't bad, but having Antike I do not see any reason to keep it.

RATING: 3
1st play: There's an interesting game here with trying to sneak in various advantages and pushing to get 4 heros or the pyramids.  Set collection with a 4x feel to it, throw in some greek mythology - there's potential here.

2nd play: Unfortunately, when everyone is paying attention, there's a race to build everything, then you run out of components.  The game then turns into who buys the gods that let you steal the one caravan token.  Military isn't so much about helping yourself to another player's good as it is about smashing units into other units while the remaining 4 players get stronger.  After about 3 hours of grinding back and forth with only 2 players having a hero (50% to victory), we called it.

A simulation of the geopolitics of the ancient Mediterranean.  Quick to teach, and allows for several routes to victory, not merely the military, as is too often the case in this sort of game.

I played this game, looked good, was doing well and then it ended???

I am a wargamer not a eurogamer.  This is 100% a eurogame. the combat mechanism is pasted on and totally pointless.

If you like eurogames fine feel free to buy it.

If you like military games and thought you might like a light game DO NOT buy this it will be a massive dissapointment

RATING: 3
Game with swift changing alliances. And with Greece in a kingmaking role and with limited defence and response capabilities - since combat takes place immediately and with fleets on very long distances - It is not too difficult to hunt down the player who is in the lead.

OK the heroes adds spice to the game but this fantasylike mechanism doesn't appeal much to me. The limitation in cities, markets etc. is fascinating but the destruction of one mostly benefits a third party. Furthermore it constrains your possibilities if you were not able to build some early in the game.

At last the whole trading mechanism adds little to the game given the time spent on it. Trading 4 different items for 4 other hopefully different items or taxes.

After gotting locked up in another three and an half hour game I am absolutely fed up with this no-sense game and intensely hates it.

Splendid game. While "Empires of the Ancient World" is more technical, this one is easy and playable (three games in a single afternoon and my group still wants to play it).

Acquired 2/10/07 (Thanks, Rodney!)

Rating based on initial play with 4 players, start positions random with the 5th removed per the instructions. I started in Rome, something I would not have chosen to do for the first play, as I prefer to play a commerce or building role rather than military. We determined the game would have been better with either 3 or 5 players, as the player with Egypt had plenty of income from cities and the best opportunity for expansion; he won as a result. 

We were all tripped up by the limitation of available buildings, and played the first several rounds forgetting that we would not be able to continue to build caravans and cities in perpetuity. There wasn't enough military action on Egypt to slow that player down, and my military actions never got further than Greece. The game felt fairly static after the buildings ran out; director roles didn't change much. There wasn't much expansion and it was a bit late in the game for some to switch gears to a military offensive to gain cities and resources. Still, it was enjoyable, and I'd like to play again... knowing now what I'd do differently.

RATING: 9
Relatively simple and fast Civ-like game. I find it very fun, although the learning curve is STEEP... In our 4-6 first games we found that several players made decisions that turned out to be huge strategical mistakes. You need to play several games before your decisions start to be ok. AND, most important, you better go and get the expansion: it's awesome!!

RATING: 8
I really like the games mechanics and play style.  The base game is very good and I'm just a touch disapointed with how the expansion changes the game play.  (It adds mythical monsters).

RATING: 4
A war game, having much more in common with Risk than any German game. Soon it's either buy markets and temples or start fighting. Game would have been better if it had been designed to finish in 1.5 hours or so, but I can't imagine a game lasting less than 4 hours. Each empire is pretty much forced into following the strategy that the designer has set up, limiting the players' own decision-making. Additionally, mistakes can be fatal.

RATING: 6
A pretty good game -- and, I think it meets its goal: to be a Civilization game you can play in under three hours. The rules are a little obtuse and scattered, but after playing, I think I'll be able to explain this one much better. We played with three, and I think it'd be much better with five...

I&#039;m normally the type of guy that gets swayed by game components. If that were the case, this game would be getting a 10. Wow! Simply incredible production quality.

The different starting positions are also quite unbalanced.

Initial Impression: After having played a session of this game one evening, I woke up the next morning thinking about my experience and my overall impressions. The factions feel asymmetrical by both the leader powers exclusive to each faction, the relative starting positions on the map, and the initial resources generated by each faction. This game has an interesting story arc and its instant victory conditions force a high amount of player interaction, both with trading of resources as well as military conflict. The game's overall balance is left up to the players as there's built-in catch up mechanism but relies on a "bash the leader" urgency. In the end, I have mixed feelings about the game and would like to try it again to see if my next experience leaves me with a similar impression as my first impression.

Played once with 5 players.  My first impression was "Wow, this is one beautiful looking game!"  I loved the color choices for the map, the size and shape of the wooden bits and the artwork on the cards.  My later impressions were "OK, uh-huh, and is that it?"

Mare Nostrum may grow on me, but it's essentially a trading game and I'm not a big fan of trading games.  To give you some perspective, I rate Settlers of Catan, Traders of Genoa, Bohnanza and Chinatown as 4's and 5's on the BGG scale.  The good news is that in Mare Nostrum you are not trading randomly acquired resources (which is a big plus,) but the bad news is that you have to trade well in order to get the game winning pyramids.

As for the civ building aspect, I liked that you conquered territories that clearly marked the trade goods to be acquired, so that trade goods were not randomly assigned as in most trading games.  I also liked that there was a potential for playing a war/diplomacy game with neighboring kingdoms.  In my session we pretty much left each other alone, so this potential was never fully realized. 

I'd be interested in playing with the expansion for it seems to offer more Heroes, Wonders, etc.

I played this in Essen (2002). It seems to be a great game!! The trade system looks simple - the person that dominates trade decides how many cards everyone should make available for trade. Then, starting with this person, everyone takes one resource or gold card from the pool of available cards. There's a lot more tactics involved in this process than you would think!
Armies and improvements can be built by spending resource cards.
It's a bit disappointing that the initial setup of the game is very similar every time, though.

With expansion.  A pretty good multiplayer Civie game. I definitely enjoyed playing this.  Its not perfect, but once  players get used to the game it wouldn't be a problem. It's a fun and interesting game, but it lasts a little too long, for what it is. This is really just a set collecting game with a lot of chrome and mechanics thrown on top of it.

So far I like this one. The combat is more interesting than some of the other games in the same general category. The rating is based on one 4-player game using the basic game with the predetermined set-up. The point allocated set-up will be played next, followed by the addition of the expansion. Also one or both of the next games will be 5-player, so the rating should show some degree of change change

I was very disappointed with this game, especially because I played with the expansion, which so many people seem to think fixes the problems with the base game. The game seemed to end prematurely before there was too much tension and when build-up and conflict had only barely begun. I was Egypt and had lost one city to occupation but gained another through expansion and building. On the last turn I got three commodities and six tax as my resources. I also got three free tax from the god card I'd bought the previous turn, giving me nine tax and three commodities. I managed to trade for two more tax, used my Cleopatra power to turn the leftover commodity into a tax, and chose myself to build first, allowing me to build the pyramids and win. Someone else could have purchased the pyramids that turn, as well. I was surprised that I could do this so early. I was feeling stuck in my corner and very vulnerable to attack. Even though I won, it seemed anti-climatic. The game had lasted less than two hours and felt like it was only just getting going, only to suddenly end. That being said, I really like the basic mechanics and feel of play. If these mechanics could be reworked into a game that had a better overall progression, I'd play.

RATING: 6
Some components seem superflurous (like the pyramid card), nice production value but the rules are too short (can you place an influence marker only where you have a ship next to the province?) I played Greece, a postion which seems rather untenable but maybe moe playings will reveal more options.

It did have a Civ light feel...but I love my Civ, so it didn't scream awesome to me.  It is a solid resourse gathering game that moves along fairly quickly, actually.  I was surprised on how quickly it moves.  The rulebook sucked, considering it was playtested for a LONG time per the designer.  But, once playing, it was simple enough.  

Update July 2013:  We played it again with the expansion and with six people.  Yah, it is down to a 2 now.  The God cards, I get, were added to balance but it just made the game meaner and completly chaotic.  Not that I don't mind chaos, but this *really* seemed to be an overkill for what I see now as a rich get richer problem.  The endgame.  Christ.  We had four of the six of us set to win in the last round.  The person picking the build order was not one of them.  REALLY????  3.5 hours of play came down to a choice by someone?  We called it a tie and that was that.  

There were many parts of the game where I wasn't doing anything.  Blah. Game is nearly broken, to me.

A great Civ game, with a good balance of commerce and warfare.  The trade system is really interesting, as are the various leader and wonder/hero abilities.  All the games I've played have been fun, and the variety of ways to win make it a game I keep wanting to play again.  Only downside is the near-necessity of a full complement of 5 or 6 players, and frankly some people I game with (i.e. family) just aren't that into the whole "ancient civilizations" theme.

My regular group really enjoys this game. Yeah, the Greeks are in a heart-breaking position facing off the Romans and Carthagenians, but we play the advanced game where players have 36 points to set up their corner and perhaps buy (or not) their faction's unique leader (randomly distributed). Diplomacy and forming coalitons to reign in the leaders is a big part of the game. What I like is that, through careful play, almost everyone has a chance to win under the advanced game rules. We've also exploring novel uses for the various powers, such as using the Lighthouse to set up forward bases on the far side of the board so power can be projected. Keeper for me!

I've been interested in trying this for a long time, and finally had the chance to.  I liked it an awful lot, although we played with some of the expansion parts, as well, and a few house rules.  So, it wasn't just the out-of-the-box game, but it definitely worked well.  Everybody loved it.

Civ game, similar to Antike as well as Civ itself. Way faster than Civ and much more enjoyable. Clever trading mechanic can be used to prevent someone collecting enough different resources to win. Mare Nostrum creates the usual kind of "win if you don't have to attack anyone else" approach.

RATING: 8
This game was designed specifically to attract fans of Civilization and Advanced Civ who wish less of a marathon experience. Initially promising but after a couple of playings it became obvious that more play testing should have been done. The game must be played with the updated rules  - and playing with the expansion helps a lot also. The game combines commodity trading alongside territorial expansion superficially not unlike Civilization and commodity accumulation provides the wherewithal to buy and build to fuel the expansion of the player's empire, but the way trading works ends up being quite a departure from what one might expect.

Here, trade turns out to be a powerful weapon designed more to break up another player's card "sets" than to build your own up, which takes some getting used to for a game which appears to revolve around traditional trading which is usually approached as negotiating win-win transactions. Here, however, trading is a forced function and players will often find that their holdings after trading will be worse than going in - which can sometimes be the intention (particularly toward a player focussing on a "tax strategy"). A major part of the game's dynamic revolves around being the one doing the forcing (seizing the role of Director of Commerce).

Moreover, the game design requires aggressive military action in order to maintain player balance and a close result. Hence, players must balance economic activity with military action as concentrating too heavily in either direction may prove quite unsuccessful. On top of this are the "wonders" and "mythical heroes" each player seeks to further his fortunes.

An interesting variation on an empire building slugfest but in a comfortable evening's session...

My first ultimate impression is that of liking it. I drew Athens, got set upon from the outset by Rome, started to dislike the unrelenting combat and posturing and finally was able to convince Rome to set his sights on Carthage(I had to beat him down a few times). So I have mixed feelings. I do well in games with a combat component but I prefer to win in other ways. And I almost did win with 12 tax cards, if not for turn order. 
The trading/economic component is very good and while it's not a "deep" game, I'd certainly go out of my way to play it again, to give myself more information with which to form an opinion.

Upon reading the rules and playing a three player game, I was very excited to get five players to the table.  Unfortunately, the board is very tight with five, and a prudent player wouldn't expose himself on a costly campaign.  This results in a lot of stagnation until one player opens up and ultimately gets trounced.  Then the player who does the trouncing wins the game.

Comprado a mila-spiele.de en medido conjunto en julio del 2010.
Juego ambientado en la época clásica. Admite cinco potencias: Grecia, Roma, Babilonia, Cartago y Egipto. El objetivo es conseguir ser el primero en construir las pirámides. En cada turno hay tres fases: Comercial (intercambiar recursos), política (construcciones) y militar (peleas). Cada fase tiene un líder que dispone de ventajas... aunque el líder puede cambiar de manos a lo largo de la partida.

Se le critica que la fase de comercio se puede volver algo engorrosa, por la cantidad de cartas que cambian de mano.

A mí me parece que el juego está bien y ofrece partidas llenas de posibilidades. :)

Después de mi segunda partida, a tres jugadores, observo que el juego se puede convertir en algo tedioso y demasiado largo (aun no he acabado nunca una partida). Esto le hace perder atractivo. 

Además, no elimina jugadores, pero puede quedar alguno en una situación irrecuperable, lo cual puede hacerle tediosa la partida. He jugado a tres, y la fase comercial queda muy sosa (todas las cartas comerciadas cambian de mano en un sentido). Le he bajado de 7.5 a 6.8 y es probable que lo ponga para venta o cambio.

Lo cambié en la mathtrade de la BSK, Invierno 2014, en Febrero y fue para Musambay.

Great game.  Nice mix of warfare with building and I love the trading system in this game.  It really is a Civilization light and the best part about it is I've had so many games where it came down to 3 or 4 possible victors in the last turn.

The only thing that keeps this game from a perfect score is the balance issues but I think those can mostly be solved by the advanced setup.

Based on only 1 play so far.  But I think this could be the Civ lite that everyone is looking for.  The rules are so simple, the game can be taught in 15 minutes or less.  The board is beautiful.  I don't think it is a wargame.  Yes, the conflict is certainly a part of the game but the director positions (which I had largely ignored) turned out to be very important.  For example, it sure is nice to use your military last after two major powers have decimated each other.  We had 5 players who had never played before and finished in just over 3 hours.  I definitely want to try this one again.

A good game that reminds me of Antike. Some interesting dynamics.

Rating after 1 play with 6 players using the expansion.

There's some great things in MN. I really like the fact that the basic rules are rather simple and that there's a lot of variety because of the different cards in the game. Roles are also important as is the fight to be the one who receives the role card.

By far the biggest problem with the game is the length of it. Our game took over 5 hours and the last hour or so was just waiting for the game to end. The system for trading is also quite dull and not too often used since most of the time it is not beneficial for the one who decides.

As with most of the civilization games there's also the big problem of being left behind. One of our 6 players spend 3 hours just watching the game and wishing that there would have been player elimination in the game.

I'm left with mixed feelings with MN.

There's lots to like here but I'm not keen to play again without the mythology expansion as I found the base game just too unbalanced, with Greece able to do little to resist Rome's military might and another player isolated enough to benefit from almost unfettered expansion.  Yes, unbalanced scenarios are a real test for experienced players but they should be optional, not the base state for the game.

Having said that there is promise here and the expansion delivers on that.

Having played twice now (the last with the Mythology expansion), I'm not too eager to try it again. Lot's of down time for little actual gain: for example, in our 6-player game it seemed to take an inordinately long time just to collect all of the resources; and with 35 different wonder/hero cards to read and evaluate all at once, analysis paralysis can easily creep in amongst newer players.

Martin Wallace, in comparison, is very good at designing Euro games that play like wargames (or is that the other way 'round?) -- this game feels like a failed attempt to emulate that type of crossover game.

[8/8/2006]

Folks, the optional rules endorsed by the game designer VASTLY improve an otherwise rather flawed game.

Those optional rules allow numerically superior fleets to blockade the transport of legions. This gives naval affairs the significance it is otherwise very much lacking, yet desperately needs.

Pericles is much enhanced by allowing the Greek fleet to lend once a turn naval support to adjacent land battles.

Caesar pays the normal rate for fortresses.

Hannibal can move from Western Tunisia to Gallia Cisalpina (i.e. crossing the Alps) at the expense of one unit being eliminated.

I had at best a lukewarm opinion of Mare Nostrum before using these optional rules. Given the severe balance issues (especially in regards to Greece) and the very satisfactory naval aspect, I'd give the original rules at most a 4/5. With the optional rules, the game deserves easily an 8. 

If you've been troubled by the issues I note, I suggest you give the game a second chance with these optionals. They certainly worked for me and our gaming group! If you like the game as it is, chances are you will love it with those alterations. Check them out! I dare say you won't regret it.

P.S.: So where does this leave my rating for this game? I'll give it a 6.5 - the middleground between my rating of the middle-ground and the new rules with the optional ones endorsed by Serge included. Pity those rules I mention are only optional and not integrated into the core rules set, so I could give the game the 8 I want it to have.

I'm not trashing this game because I got trashed at this game.  I'm sorry, this game doesn't work.  First, it is not very entertaining, especially when the game takes 2+ hours.  The strategy is lacking because the gameplay is too simple.  However the rules are complex where they don't need to be.  I played with two who had played at least 4 games each beforehand, and they were still refering to the rules as if it was a war game.  The victory conditions have nothing to do with winning a war, instead you have to build a pyramid?#$%^#$   I thought only the Egyptians built pyramids, but whatever.  And apparently all it takes to build a temple is some fish, some fruit and a slave.  Just as long as the slave stays fed, this temple should take only a 150,000 years to build.  Unless it is a really small temple.   There are plenty of games that are faster than this, with more strategy and a better theme.  There are also plenty of games longer than this (Axis & Allies, Civ)  that explore the theme of development and war, that stay on track, and have long gameplay because of the subtle strategies.  Mare Nostrum is sub-mediocre in everything that people look for in a game and is just plain horrible.

More of an economic/trading game than a military/civ game, Mare Nostrum has a lot of interesting moving pieces to its overal mechanics.  There is a very steep learning curve, so be prepared for your first couple of games to not play as you think it might.  Rating could really go up after I play again.--2 games played and both games came down to a multi-player tie with the winner being decided by build-order director.  I have never seen such blatant kingmaking as the end-game for this loser.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I had hopes, but Mare Nostrum is a disappointment. I had discovered the game hunting down "dudes on a map" and "civ lite" games, and this one was generally well-regarded. After one play, I'm not sure though that it can deliver on what I hoped.

I liked the streamlined rules, the concept of having one role determine turn order in each phase, the limited wooden pieces and the balance between military and economy. 

What didn't I like? The trading phase felt wonky. Being able to totally shut down trading or cut the trading to only two people felt too extreme. Even with the rule tweaks from the expansion, Greece is in a tough spot, and that player got pounded on pretty heavily.

I play dudes on a map games because I like the direct interaction and table talk, but in practice a good game will keep each player involved and not virtually eliminated for a major portion of the game. Maybe greater knowledge of how the game works would keep players in better check of each other, but unfortunately, I almost certainly won't have that opportunity with my current game group.

Update: ...and that pretty much sealed the deal. Traded this away for Tigris and Euphrates and some Yomi decks.

It really needs five players (its major weakness) but aside from that, a wonderful implentation of the Civilization franchise.

Granted, only one play and we got a couple rules wrong. I'm planning a second playing to confirm this opinion...but its hard to imagine the game changing that much.

The premise is cool. The components are lovely. I think the game play is enjoyable, too. But the win conditions feel so arbitrary and tenuously connected to what you do on the board. The trading phase probably decides the game. The person who is able to get the ability to choose who builds first may play kingmaker much too easily for my taste. Seems borderline broken.

RATING: 6
Mare Nostrum is yet another attempt to create a shorter Civ-type game. Each player starts with a civilization featuring a special power due to their leader and access to a small handful of the, I think, 12 trade goods. On their turn, players first collect taxes from their cities and collect trade based on caravans. They then go into a trade phase where a number of cards are taken from their hand of their choice and laid face up in front them. Players then take turns drafting cards from these face up offerings, with the player whose card was selected getting to make the next pick. After this is done, players get to build stuff with the cards. Most of the things being bought require "sets" of unlike trade goods with the exception being the tax cards which have to be all tax cards. Things cost multiples of 3, with the cost noting how many unlike cards have to be in a set to buy it. Basic military things cost 3, more trading stuff or multiplier effects cost 6, special powers in the form of wonders and leaders cost 9, and you can always just win the game for 12. Finally, there is a military phase, where guys can manoeuvre around the board, trashing stuff and disrupting trade. The game goes until someone builds the 12 card or some combination of 3 wonders/heroes in addition to their starting one.

MN is an interesting game and there is a lot going on. The trading phase, for instance, has a lot of angling for unlike cards as rare items are snapped up quickly, and the person who gets to choose how many cards are put out (this is a power based on having strong goods production on the board) has a lot of leeway to dictate how much people's hands are being changed around by trade. This phase seems to require a lot of care, as it is important to disrupt people who look like they are going to be able to create larger sets which can buy special powers and game winning effects. The game also has an artificial shortage of the city/city multiplier/trade/trade multiplier chits, so it forces people to compete over these things. In theory, players will be forced into each other's kitchens to be able to keep producing things, a good design choice.

My first game of this was a bit wonky as we played with a full table, most of us newbies, and no one was disrupted fast enough. Just as the military units were starting to appear, one guy was able to put together a set of 12 to win the game because of his huge goods production power. This is a game, in hindsight, that has some interesting choices, but which really seems like it would require some regular or at least semi-regular play to shine. A lot of the balance, like many of these games, seems to require players keeping each other in check. Of course, keeping people in check requires knowing what can actually get out of hand in the first place, which is difficult when you first sit down to a game. I think my recommendation to the casual interested person is to not get this unless you actually intend to hit it up a few times in short order with the same group, because the player-created balance that this game seems to be pushing means that newbies in your neighbourhood can easily create a quick win, at least if they're not the extremely aggressive types, in which case they might just cost both of you the game, which doesn't sound a lot better. In general, the strategies here seem like they would be interesting with repeat play and would have room to evolve, but a single person who has less experience could be enough to hand the game away.

I am rating this 6 for now, but it's the provisional type and is based on having played it with 6 (using the Mythology expansion), which I felt was too many with as many new people as we had. The game might be fantastic with 6 experienced players, but I would prefer to try it with fewer in the future. I don't like it enough to buy it myself, but I would be willing to play it with the same people repeatedly to see if the seeming potential depth is here in that environment. There is certainly an interesting base here, especially because of the variety of powers that are available, I'm just not sure if I have the group to really get it up to that potential or if it's good enough for me to justify giving it that kind of table-time. I also have some lingering doubts about the balance of this type of game in general for my tastes, because a lot of it seems to ride on not being the guy being beaten over the head by the other people at the table. The trading phase, for example, would hypothetically allow the table to shut someone out by not taking any of their cards until the pickings were extremely slim if they were the perceived leader. Thus, it would be possible to artificially put someone in a losing / much worse position repeatedly by continually forcing them to play with a sub-standard hand. Extended out to a long, experienced game, it seems like it could turn into a "duck your head and pray no one sees what you're up to" type of thing where the person who is not perceived as the threat is the only one who can sneak out a win. Meta play like this actually seems like it would be intelligent play at an advanced table, and I'm not sure if I like that sort of element in my games. Being the guy stuck in the middle, like all of these games, also seems like it's a recipe for trouble because you have more ways to have your throat slit. FWIW, of the recent "light Civ" games I've played, this is a notch better than Tempus, and a couple better than Antike. Again, for whatever that's worth.

Fairly enjoyable fantasy wargame. It has a nice mix of building resources and armies using sets of resource cards while trying to stop your opponents completing the winning conditions before you do. I've only played using the expansion and I'm not sure if some countries are unbalanced and the game ending works all that well. The main downside is sorting/collecting the similar looking resource cards and it needs at least 4 players and a big table to work well.

When you've played a game 20+ times over 3 years and you realize that you love it MORE than you did the first times you played it, you know it's a classic.  MARE NOSTRUM is such a game for me.  Unlike most recent "Civ in 90 minutes" games which shall remain unmentioned, Mare Nostrum actually manages to capture the spirit and flow of ancient civilizations while also allowing the player a huge amount of freedom.  Mare Nostrum combines the best traits of American-style light wargames with the fluidity and structure of Euro designs and the result is a game that has much of the flavor of Civilization (particularly in the trading and expansion) in a 2-3 hour game.  There is an inherent variability built in to the game where games can be won through shrewd trading, economic dominance, military strength, or smart diplomacy and the possibilities make for an interesting game every time.  Ignore all the Eurosnoot internet bitchers, this is one of the best games currently available- it will appeal to folks who love Advanced Civ but also to people who like Settlers.  A real, bona fide masterpiece. Do not hesitate to purchase the Mythology expansion- it's essential!

Our group played this twice. Both games came in under the two hour mark. The game mechanics are good. I like the different powers each nation has at the start. The warfare and trading are good. Overall its a good experience. We didn't have a great deal of warfare but I feel this will change as we get more experience. There are also a number of other elements like the heroes and wonders that add to the game. The economics are also a good addition. Having leaders for the political, economic and military realms is also a good idea. Lots of good elements in this one.

Mare Nostrum is a bit of a mixed bag, I feel. Back when the game was released, a '2 hour 4X title like Civilization' was considered to be something of a design grail. Many who flocked to this title based on that premise walked away equally quickly, because the game simply didn't respond well to being played as a 4X title. Trade is very counter-intuitive, and actually more of a weapon rather than something you will easily profit from. Players were also not used to playing a civ according to its strong points: this is incredibly important to do in MN, for if you don't you will lose. A further nail in the coffin was that the rulebook was horrible, containing many errors and embellishments introduced by clueless translators. It took quite some time for these errors to be sorted out... and by that time the damage had already been done of course.

But the biggest flaw was probably that the game as published in 2003 simply wasn't properly balanced. There are quite a few rough spots lurking in here: Rome is very powerful while Greece is weak (especially with the recommended setup). Some time thereafter some balance fixes were introduced which helped considerably, but it doesn't look particularly good when the game needs fixes (no matter how small) in order to become properly playable. The author redeemed himself in the eyes of many by releasing the Mythology Expansion: personally I consider that expansion a load of fecal matter as it introduces far more rules conflicts and a great deal of Magic-like combo'ing into a game which doesn't support it.

For better of for worse, I've played quite a bit with the fixes in place over the years... and have to conclude that MN really is a product of its age. It opened the eyes of many in that you could create a functional hybrid between war games and euros, but the game itself is also fairly brittle in that players have little time to ponder alliances and practice diplomacy: attacks must be made swiftly and precisely otherwise there is no longer a need to continue playing. With less than the full compliment of 5, MN breaks down in noticable ways. Also the timing of the game feels 'off': it takes forever to acquire your first Honder, while numbers #3 and especially #4 really don't do anything for your own development any more. In other words: the game could stand further development... and this it actually got in the form of the 'reboot' Mare Nostrum: Empires. That game has been placed on a much stronger game-theoretical footing, and gives the players much more to do as the action already begins from turn #2 onward. 

It is all very understandable why the game suffered from the problems that it did, and back then there really wasn't much competition to compare the whole to. But as I'm writing this about a decade has passed since I began playing MN, and sadly times [i]have[/i] changed. For the better, that's the good news... but the sad news is that the rate of this game has taken a hit, and might suffer from more such hits in the future.

Good trading game with a war game added on.

RATING: 6
My typical group is 4-player, and I think Mare Nostrum has balance issues with anything less than 5 (and maybe even then). It's fun to play so long as everyone recognizes the inherent imbalances present (either Rome or Egypt is almost certain to win, and Greece has little to no chance of victory, though we have certainly witnessed exceptions to the rule). If everyone's on the ball and taking actions to prevent an easy Rome/Egypt win, then the game is fun.

I've only ever played it once with five players, and despite one of those being completely new to the game, it felt much more balanced.

Traded away.

This is a fantastic game, I have played it only with 5 players and once with 4 (not as good). The Mythology expansion makes the game even better and is a must if you have the base game. 

I have been told that it is easier to win with Egypt, but after several plays there has been a even spread amongst the civs for winning. There was no one civ with a higher win ratio,

Let me clarify my rating: I don't think the game itself is bad.  In fact, I thought it was pretty interesting.  Unfortunately the game was far too fiddly, especially with all of the resource cards.  We spent more time doing housekeeping tasks than we did actually playing.

The fiddlyness of the game was so high, though, that I honestly don't care to play the game again.  If it were reprinted and reworked in some fashion I'd certainly give it another go.

Played this 5 player and played to a stalemate that lasted a couple hours.  There was little nor no incentive to attack.  The game finally ended when 2 players got to build 2 heroes in the same turn.  One player built to 3 and got smashed by the rest.  I havent played more than the 3 times when i bought it.

RATING: 2
Update: 2  Played the 2016 release recently and have back-rated this one.  I cannot see myself playing this game or the 2016 one ever again.   The problems inherent in multiplayer 4x games are just too much for me to overlook.   This game may be a lot of fun for some people; however my gaming tastes have changed quite a bit in the past 10 years.

I'm rating this game a 6 because I think it has a lot of potential.  There are pretty cool mechanisms for fighting, mythological creatures, wonders, heroes.  A lot of good things about this game.  But where it misses is a typical problem in many multiplayer wargames.   There's a nasty king-making element here combined with a big incentive not to fight.  In our 5er game, the Babalyonians and Romans started off strong.  As Greece, I could not catch them.  I could try to delay their progress at my own expense (via combat), but whomever I delayed via combat would propel the other to victory. 

This is with the expansion.

I would play again though.  It's a fun ride, but ultimately there doesn't seem to be a lot of decisions to make.

RATING: 5
Elegant "Civ" type empire growing game.  Up to five civilizations take in income from cities and commodities and reinvest them into military and passive expansion, reaping further income.  Income is ultimately spent on Wonders and Heroes, which are required to win the game.  Early days but this seems like good stuff.  The endgame may have the problem of coming down to a popularity contest, but that should be fixable.

Very good game. It has a very unique design and I have yet to find someone who does not like it. The chits and cards are high quality and plain beautiful.

It is one of my girlfriends favourite games although it is a three hour (!) "I'll kick you in the  groin (!!) with my soldiers (!!!) and might even bring my Kraken (!!!!)" type of game.

It looks lovely...however, there are a couple of problems that we have perceived. If you get hit early you are constantly behind and you struggle to catch up. The drawing of commodities seems ok but the trading is seriously flawed. 1 person gets to control the entire table so he does whats in HIS best interest.

We have only played it once, and we may change our minds....but at present it's not quite the game we had hoped for.

This is a terrific game. Love the trading system and the fact that it doesn't take forever, in fact it can be too short, but that is easily fixed with the variants. It is Civilization-lite. Oh, the expansion helps the game a great deal.

I've played this twice now and I really want to like it, but it's just not my cup of tea. First time I played was with Greece and I got my ass handed to me on a plate. Second time I was Rome and we modified Rome's startup to make it a little more balanced, and I also got my ass handed to me on a plate. I typically don't rate games based on the outcome of my play, but I didn't find either play very enjoyable and it seems each civilization has a certain strategy they HAVE to follow or they'll get trounced. Would like to try again with the advanced setup sometime.

A simple wargame compared to others. Luck in combat. Player elimination. It can take a couple of hours to play a game. Beautiful artwork. Some cool ideas.

Some Cilizations are better than others, so not well balanced. Can be unpleasent if you are one of the weaker Civilizations. Bash the leader, bash the weak.

It's refreshing to play a territorial game where military force is a means to an end, but doesn't constitute victory in itself.  It's a fun and interesting game, but for what it is, it lasts a little too long.

Limited options, forced conflict and indistinguishable trade goods made this game unpalatable for my gaming group.  We all prefer to play Advanced Civilization (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/177), even though it's much longer.  While the overall production quality is high (it's really a beautiful game), the tokens representing cities, markets, temples and caravans are unsatisfactory flat cardboard chits.  Cities and temples are hard to distinguish from one another, and the caravan tokens conceal the resource sites that they mark.  Rules are brief and simple, though a bit badly written; some critical information for three and four player setup is only included in the "Questions" section of the rules, and other cases are not addressed at all.  If you're looking for a lighter alternative to Advanced Civilization, I recommend Vinci (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/60) instead.

Trading, economy, civilization, military elements - plus high production, and different enough from Antike, and [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/5698]somewhat reminscent of Serenissima[/url].  Resource production, trading, and building like Settlers of Catan, military elements like Diplomacy and Risk, as stated well [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/14384]here[/url]. Some accuse it of being imbalanced for one civilization (Carthage and especially Greece have a very difficult time, and Egypt and Rome are strongest), but [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/342972]there are rule tweaks that solve this[/url] - see the optional rules introducing naval blockade rule for Greece; a better Pericles (a free trireme at start), a slightly worse Caesar (fortresses cost 3 not 2), and an improved Hannibal (a free legion at start).  The players also serve as an important balancing mechanism, by holding back leaders (i.e. a totally straightforward solution is built into the game - negotiation, using built-in weakness and strength as bargaining chips.)  The Director of Commerce (initially Carthage) especially plays an important role to ensure other players sets are broken up (eg prevent Egypt from winning with taxes by trading 4-5 cards, or refusing trades with Egypt), and should not be played by an experienced player.  Best with 5, really needs the expansion to balance it when playing with 3 or 4 - see [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/347621]this review[/url] for a guide to playing with different numbers of players.  The relatively small number of tokens IS the source of conflict and drives the game.  See [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/121230]this article[/url] for detailed observations about balance and strategy, [url=http://fortressat.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1238&Itemid=551]this article[/url] for a response to some typical criticisms of the game, and the excellent articles on strategy [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/forum/67/boardgame/17099]here[/url] and [url=http://spotlightongames.com/analysis/mare.html]here[/url].
Recommended tie breaker: it seems unfair to let the political leader decide the winner if two players can get four Heros/Wonders (or Pyramids) in one turn.  Solution: Winner can only be declared after end of construction phase for all players, and if there is a tie with Heros/Wonders, then resolve it with total number of cards that would be produced (taxes and commodities) plus active military units (legions/triremes/fortresses).

Carthage is the hardest to play, followed by Greece, so these should be played by experienced players, while new players should play Babylon.  Since inexperienced players can easily bring a game of Mare Nostrum to a premature conclusion as a result of poor choices (especially the Carthaginian player), so consider this variant for new players:
1. [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/346355]Eliminating the pyramids as an instant win condition[/url] 
2. Limiting trade to four or five cards.

Impressions after four or five games: a good civ game, more military and less tech than Antike, and having assymetrical civilizations means it plays differently for each nation, also less dry/mechanical.  Ingenious trading mechanic.  The Leader roles are critical!  Can't wait to play again!

[gameid=17099] - corrects any perceived imbalance of the base game, and makes the game more playable for 3-4 players.  I don't like the idea of buying help from the gods though, although this aspect could be left out.

A fun game, well built.  The only complaint I really have is that it could use a board of some sort to keep track of your current standings in cities and caravans, etc.  I know there is a player aide on this page that will serve this purpose, but it should have been included with the game.  Also, I spend too much time handing out goods cards, then taking them back three seconds later and sorting them back... repeat a million times.  But that aside, it&#039;s a pretty intense game.  Big fun and I do see where people call it Civ Lite.  It has a lot of that civ flavor... :)

RATING: 6
Funny, I'm almost disappointed to give this game a 6...  I guess expecting too much because of the general appreciation of my group.  Not that there is anything major wrong, I just find that there seems to be patterns when playing with 5 players.  The choices seem to make themselves and leave little for the powers to experiment with.  My initial impression is that this game could suffer from a bout of "Axis&Allies-itis" in that the first moves are pretty much self-evident.  Also, much as I try to see differently I don't think all powers are created equal.  I'll play it again for sure, so I'll keep an open mind.  And I'll try it with the expansion to be sure I get the full experience.

---------------

Update: Played with the Mythology expansion which supposedly fixes some of the problems in the original game (getting rid of Helen of Troy is a nice first step).  Ultimately, we don't know how the game will be fixed because there is definitely something missing.  It appears that to enjoy the game as it was meant to be played, the players must collude to bring down whoever seems to be the closest to victory.  The trading mechanism is brilliant until you realize how easily 12 ressources can be acquired to build the Pyramids.  Scripted games never had a hold on this play group and it's probably something that no ancient God could fix.  Very disappointing has this game remains one of the most beautiful around.

Somebody please fix this!

Possible suggestions to make game more enjoyable: 

- Limit trading to 4 cards;
- Remove the Pyramids as a winning condition;
- Have variable and hidden winning conditions;
- Something else...

RATING: 7
A light civ game, with lots of small elements that normally wouldn't stand on their own, but the game as a whole does all of these elements well and combines them with some streamlined mechanics. 
The trade system is awesome, and the combat, while abstract, makes the game pretty intense at times. I like the idea of building being the key to winning, rather than combat, but using warfare as a means to limit others progress. 

PROS:
- Relatively short play time once you get to know it, at least for all the concepts it delivers.
- A ancient civ theme!
- Fun trade mechanic, and makes trade a little more strategic rather than bluff/negotiate based. It keeps the game balanced, as you MUST trade resources, you cannot hoard them.
- Combat is quick and abstract, but always looming. Gives you another aspect to manage, and allows for bluffing and threatening. Personally I use my military to force people to be nice to me, rather than actually attacking anyone. 
- Components are fantastic. Everything is wood, even the dice! The cards are pretty nice stock and the board is big (see cons about the board though).
- Simple rules/mechanics, but has a lot of strategy involved, specifically the trade phase. I love when games use pretty simple rules to produce a pretty deep experience.  

CONS:
- Unbalanced. This seems to be the typical complaint I've seen on BGG. After reading the magnificent history behind the designers "years of development" on it, I would have thought it wouldn't need much fixing, but it requires some home brew rules to keep the game fair. There are some good balancing resources here on the Geek, but I personally just made and use my own. But still, home brew rules are a must when playing, and then make the game a huge blast every time. A personal note: Normally this would totally kill my rating/fun level, but the fixes are easy enough, and the reward for doing so is great. 
- Board is a bit unclear at times with the region borders and rivers. I think it could have been a little more clear, as borders can be confused with rivers and visa versa. While it isn't a problem after a few plays, it can make it annoying to have to explain borders/rivers when it could have been made more obvious.
- SOMETIMES it's really obvious who is going to win a couple turns from the end, which can make for a disappointing experience. However, there are enough tricks in the game to keep guessing who exactly is going to win.. You just know it wont be you, lol.

I am happy with this game as a shortened alternative to Civilization and I personally believe it deserves the title "Civ Lite".

Trade is very important, and allowing somebody to dominate more than one of each area (trade, politics and/or military) is a sure way to hand them the game.

A wargame mixed with a resource management game and giving the feel of neither type. I played Serge Laget's prototype extension with 6 players, packed with gods and special powers. The resulting game is long, very long, and could have gone on for numerous more turns in our case. That's way too much for what the game is. My point of view might be influenced by the fact that one player was a whiner, so my rating could go up.

Good game - would definitely play again, especially with the expansion. Would like to play more often if not for the length of game play. Found myself thoroughly engaged for most of the game (little downtime).

I don't think there's enough room on the proverbial shelf for this and a game like Shogun. Will try Mare Nostrum a couple more times with the expansion and see. Leaning towards trading Shogun though as Mare Nostrum felt more engaging than Shogun. Time will tell.

It really didn't work at all with our group. I blame metagaming, but still, other games didn't feel as drawn out and kind of cyclical as this one. And the limit on armies and boats seems so low that you can max out pretty easily and then everybody's at the same level. We tried it three times and it never was a good experience, so we decided to let it go. Also my friend couldn't get over the fact that city construction is limited by available chits ("Let's build a mighty city!" ; "Can't do that, Boss, the world is out of stone.").

Very balaced game full of good ideas and principles. There are a lot of ways to keep others from winning, which can extend the game another 3 hours after the first "Noone is gonna stop that guy". Not a 10, because you the right people for it. It is just not that much fun with all defensive players at the board.

EDIT after several more plays: I decreased rating from 9 to 7. The "keep others from winning" strategy is interesting first, but I am annoyed by it now. This mechanism extends the game for hours after it feels finished.

To say that this game is a „sibling” of the classic Civilization boardgame would be something of an exaggeration. Although there are some similarities (namely, the theme and the map), this is a totally different game. The great pitfall is that players have no incentive to take the initiative, and the whole thing comes to a carefully balanced stalemate after a few games, when players have acquired sufficient experience and know what is good for them. We actually had to abort a game when nothing happened after two identical turns, and nobody dared to take bold action, fearing to leave his back unprotected.

Very impressed with this game after initial playings.  Very fast-moving once all the players are up to speed.  This game has the virtues of Civilization without the all-day play time.

Great game with many different ways to manage power and keep people involved.  All players have to be good at stategy games though newbies or non-stategy people throw off the balance because they mess up the trading or try to play as an all out war game.  So give it a few plays and use different countries but the same people then decide.  The endgame can be abrupt and lackluster because it ends with a build.I have won with every country numerous times as have friends, if you think greece is getting beat up on then somebody is playing poor strategy.  Rome has no reason to go after greece, carthage only a small reason to attack Greece but is better off going after rome, babylon would rather take from egypt, carthage or rome.  Really greece's only real enemy should be egypt which doesn't have any military advantage.This may look like a war game but it's not, the object of the game is to build stuff... only use military as a raiding tactic, you get in steal enough taxes, or commodities to build a wonder/hero or even the pyramids (I have won with every nation multiple times!) and get out keep the troops alive to resuse elsewhere or to defend with.GREAT GAME!!!

I like this game and look to play it with crossover wargamers.  Read the rules clarifications as it's easy to get confused.  Unfortunately has some balance concerns which weren't addressed until the expansion, but still a good game.  The trade mechanic is novel and good.

I really like the theme ... the playing time is usually about right (though highly variable) ... and the components are great. Two problems (for me) that drop MN down a peg or two: (1) I just don't like the trading aspect. With all the cards (potentially) flowing around, there is a pretty high likelihood that someone will make a mistake that "gives" the game to another player. Trading is also the slowest part of the game (get me to the exploitation and combat). (2) It is difficult for a player who makes an error early in the game to seriously contend for the victory.

Far from being the greatest game ever made, Mare Nostrum holds some considerable entertainment value. The gameplay is simple and quick. The logic of the game is easy to follow and different special abilities add a lot to the game. I have a feeling that there is a small runaway-leader -problem here, but I've seen much worse in other games.

The general game isn&#039;t very complex, but you often get caught up in situations that aren&#039;t covered by the rules as given. There will probably be as many ways of playing this game as there are players...
Still, a game with a lot of potential. Adjust the rules a little bit in a way the players will be forced to attack each other. One way to do this is not using the multipliers (markets and temples). This way you&#039;ll have to earn your resources by invading other provinces. For more information, read the thousands of FAQ&#039;s concerning this game :-)

I love this civ game, but it needs to get to the table more than it does.  It really needs 5P or 6P (with expansion).  I was initially annoyed at the inclusion of mythological elements in the expansion.  It is still not my preference, but game-wise, it does a tremendous job in making each of the nations unique and fun to play in their own ways.

Played one game, mixed feelings.  I liked it but I don't know where it will go ratingwise.  Need to play again.  Trading didn't really jump out at me as a fun mechanic, and the extreme limitation on the countermix is a bit of a bleh thing as an artificial way to create conflict.  The asshole we played with shut trading down on his turns, which really ground the game into a long slog.

My game was subject to an epic player meltdown, which is always a good sign.

Finally got to play this, and my first playing of this was with the expansion, so that is something to take into account.  On the whole, I enjoyed this, and I am a sucker for games with special or variable powers.  It is a little difficult to keep track of everyone, but in comparison to Parthenon, this game is a dream.  I can easily see getting distracted with attacking and defending.  It does lack the feeling of advancing one's own civ which is something that I like.  It's more about expansion.  Still, I enjoyed it, and it is beautifully produced.

RATING: 6
A victim of unfair expectations.  This game had been so over-hyped as a three-hour distillation of the best parts Avalon Hill's Civilization that it was guaranteed to be viewed as a disappointment.  I was reluctant to even try Mare Nostrum because of the negative buzz.  Now that I've played it, I count it as my most pleasant surprise of 2003. 

*Update*  Well, it's March 2005 now and Mare Nostrum still hasn't hit the table since my first game.  A longer game (not that Mare Nostrum is terribly long) that requires several players has to be really good in order to beat out the other choices, and I'm not sure Mare Nostrum quite makes it.  I'd still like to give it another try, but I may never get the opportunity.  So what's holding us back?  Three things.  (1) The need for exactly five players (although four's not bad), (2) the fuss and legwork involved in the rather awkward trade card system, and (3) the stalemates that result because the game is too balanced.  I think the last one is the biggest problem.  Players all claim their slice of the pie, which is not enough for anyone to win. Then the various positions thrive or suffer based mostly on how hard they're hammered by the other players. It's one of those "Don't let him win!" games, and I've got to say that I'm not partial to that style of game.

RATING: 7
I had a too big expectation for this game. The flaw is that the game takes long time in combination that you need to play it several times. An early error can make you suffer for the rest of the game. I can see a good potential, but it will probably be difficult to get other players to play it more.

I am not sure on this one. All the right mechanics are there for this to be enjoyable, but I found that if the players on the far side of the board from you are not doing their job keeping their neighbors down, this game can end suddenly before some players have gotten far into their strategies.
It seems like the players that start out with a majority of gold OR a majority of trade items more quickly get to 6 or 9 cards to build cool things, while the players who start out with a balanced distribution of trade/gold locations fall behind.
Definitely ONLY play this with the Mythology expansion.

Great fun until the endgame, and then it's bash-the-leader for several hours. There's just no way to adequately defend yourself from attacks by sea, particularly if your opponents put aside their differences to gang up on you. All three of our games lasted about five hours, and two of those ended with someone falling ass-backwards into a win because a weird chain of events with the trading allowed them to build the pyramids.

Played with 4 players and 5 players. There is a fragile game system at work which does nothing to stop quick anticlimatic game ends when playing with inexperienced players. It only seems to play right with 5. This game is going to generate a lot of bitching around the table with players needing to colude to keep a leader from winning. I don't like all this verbal carry on to be a feature of the games I play,

I think Antike has a similar feel but scales better, I much prefer Antike to Mare Nostrum though I conceed that it also has a fragile system resulting in possible duff games between inexperienced players. March 09

I love this game. I have played several 5-player games and they have all been knuckle biters. I can't understand peoples confusion with the rules though. I read the rules a few times before playing the game, and if you just take whats written verbatim and don't interpret whats there, they are very well written. The only issue I found was with the Political and Military leaders determination of order (done all at once, or person by person), which has since been clarified. In the games I have played in, we have found a tax card win to be easier than a 12-card commodity win, but a 4 hero/wonders win is still a bit easier. We have had several games where 11 cards were all that one player could garner through trading, so if players are conscious of what is going on during the trading phase, you can prevent the supposed leader from winning (at least right away). The components are excellent, although I would have liked the civilization sheets to be on hard stock rather than paper. I highly recommend this game.

Thematic fighting and expanding on a map mixed with abstract anti-set collection.  The game itself is fine, but I don't like how starting positions are pretty unbalanced, requiring player interaction to fix balance issues.  I often like to play regular games that a group likes, but often we have a new person or 2.  I don't need the new person to be in winning contention, but I don't want new player moves to just completely unbalance the game(which happens here).

Well, away from the nice trading mechanism and order of the characters, the game ends pretty fast and suprisingly. Another thing I didn't like was the very bad overview. The board is big and the different markers don't look different enough.

All in all, you can get a very similar gaming experience without the luck and a much better overview with Antike.

I only played Mare Nostrum for the first time last night and I really enjoyed it. There were plenty of choices to be made in working toward a victory. Unfortunately, I didn't make the right ones :) 

We played with the expansion and I really liked how the mythical creatures and use of the Gods were part of the game. 

I guess the only downside that I see is that I was told that 6 players is best for the game and there might be certain issues when you have fewer players. It's not always easy to get 6 players, but if you can, it's a real cool game. Then again we played with the expansion, so I guess the base set would be fine with 5 players.

Seems to live up the to &#039;Civ-in-an evening&#039; hype. A couple of rules niggles that need to be thrashed out with a visit to the FAQ. Otherwise, highly recommended - has already become a firm favourite with our group.
Now that we have got to grips with some of the tactics, I would query the playing time or 2-3 hrs. We regularly have to carry over onto the next session after 3 hours (-; A laminated copy of the board and some washable pens are invaluable as not all territories have &#039;names&#039; which makes writing down positions on bits of paper very difficult.

Amazing game (I have played only with the Mythology expansion). Easy to learn and teach, but the gameplay is fantastically dynamic and open. Every civilization has to worry about at least two fronts. Every civilization is unique (unique tactical position, unique powers). There is a huge variety of different kind of powers that can be acquired to help address different strategic problems that one may encounter. There is also a great balance between the game and the metagame (diplomacy) in Mare Nostrum. For example, given that turn order in each phase is decided by a player whose civilization meets certain criteria, the fight for turn order, and the bribery of the person who controls it, throws all kind of deal-making and breaking opportunities at players. You need to form alliances and break them at key moments. Everyone at one point or another depends on the good graces of someone else. Even if  you are poised to win, you will probably still be at someone else's mercy, and that means the dynamic can get fiery and unpredictable. So much fun! 

Incredibly, the game also wraps this up in 3-4 hours (a first game full of newbies will take 4-4.5 hours, but after that it will get closer to 3).

RATING: 6.5
A Political, Economic and light wargame of many subtleties.  Each Empire starts off with a slight advantage in one area.  Winning usually requires finess, in this most excellent game!

Initially, everyone races to increase their economies via the building of Caravans and Markets.  Once these tokens have all been bought, players start increasing their military, which they hope to use in order to "help" with their Diplomacy  :)

All battles (ground and naval) are resolved by rolling 1d6 per unit, totaling the result, then dividing by 5 to determine the number of enemy units destroyed.

The game's winner is usually the player who has played the best political game, or the one who has managed to put everyone to sleep and then builds the coveted Pyramid wonder!

The game is best played with 5, and is still Ok with 4.  Unfortunately, it does not work too well with only 3.  

A 3-player scenario (Triumvirate) has been published.  Rating adjusted due to 3-player scenario!

Looks nice and has a good feel to it. But after two four player games (the first of which we were playing some rules incorrectly that especially weakened Egypt) the game seems hopelessly unbalanced. Rome looks by far the strongest. Carthage at a big disadvantage. Nice try but was ANY play testing done?

RATING: N/A
Civ game in (1 to) 3 hours - sounds really good.  Balance issues (not everyone notices these) addressed by Mythology expansion which is highly rated.  Ideally want 5 (or 6 with Mythology) players for full monty.  To ponder - game is unforgiving - non-gamers who make mistakes can throw whole game, not just their chances - needs right group.

After the great experience of opening it up and finding a marvelous and beautiful game I was sadly disapointed at the gameplay (It ended in 5 turns maybe less, very anti-climatic). We're not giving up, rating will probably go higher.

Must play with expansion rules.

A good game with victory conditions (build stuff) that make it play differently than I first thought (i.e. not as much combat).

Keen to play again, probably with the epic variant.

[q="EndersGame"]Recommendations for new players

Inexperienced players can easily bring a game of Mare Nostrum to a premature conclusion as a result of poor choices (especially the Carthaginian player, by trading too many cards and giving Egypt or Greece a chance to win by using Tax cards to build the pyramids). Consider this variant for new players:
1. Eliminate the pyramids as an instant win condition 
2. Limit trade to a maximum of four or five cards.
3. Ensure that Carthage (Director of Commerce) is played by the most experienced player. Babylon is ideal for the most inexperienced player.[/q]

Some reminders:

* A player's capital province cannot be converted by another player.  (Neutrals' can be though.)

* Occupying buildings counts towards Roles for the occupier (not the owner of the province).

* You're supposed to remove 8 random heroes in set up.

* Ariane only works in defence.

This was 20 years in development? Well, even a solitaire playtest would have shown the designer that Greece was significantly weaker than the other powers. Fundamentally the problem here is that if the players play to properly balance the game then no-one can win (even your cards are public knowledge to anyone paying attention). Trading, which works so well in Civilization, borders on being pointless here. This may be 'Civ Lite', but other than combat, every aspect of this game is inferior to the original.

Un juego que captura el espíritu de las antiguas civilizaciones otorgando a los jugadores mucha libertad en acciones a realizar. Combina lo mejor de los wargames ligeritos de estilo americano con la fluidez y estructura de un Eurogame conservando el aroma del Civilization clásico Cada civilización tiene sus propias debilidades y puntos fuertes a explotar... Comercio, roles como el de Lider Político o lider militar que se ganan o pierden durante la partida.PROS: Sencillo y corto (en 2-3 horas se tiene la partida acabada). CONS: No hay mucho desarrollo de la civilización. Sólo para jugarlo ocasionalmente. Problemas de Kingmaking (pudiera suceder que el lider político decidiera quién gana). ¿Los romanos necesitan construir pirámides para ganar? Casi el 75% de la tensión de la partida sucede cuando se está acabando.

La expansión arregla el problema de "saco de boxeo" de Grecia.

First played this on May 3rd, 2007.  This isn't as complicated as it looks or sounds (keep in mind I've played A&A so that may skew my judgement).  I've heard it is a more palitible version of Civilization.  The rules are long, say 15 minutes for a good explaination which I was fortunate enough to recieved.  The game says that it'll take 2.5 hour or so which is a bit long for our typical group to play.  It seems to be worth it however and I had a blast.  We played as three players and it didn't seem to play as well as it could.  I somehow figured that it was about conflict (and was wrong at least for the start) and initiated it too early in the game and caused the 3rd player to have free reighn to victory I suppose.  We finished in an hour.  It will take a game play to figure out what to do, and then you still will need to play it several times to get a good feel for it (or so it seems).  I'd recommend it to those who like complex strategy games and would like a shorter version.  Of course you may not have two hours to play a game like this as well.

RATING: N/A
Not sure what to make of this one yet.  It's alleged the designer intended to make a Civ (AH) game that was playable in just a few hours, and that's probably where my problems arise.

Civ, to me, is crazy intense trading sessions and constant border skirmishes/negotiations.

MN's trading is just barely trading.  It's kind of... lame, and slow, and i just doesn't recreate the Civ experience for me, though it certainly seems to have all of the elements in place.  Want to try several more times...

Game is great, exept the naval rules are flawed.  Greece can never defend aganst invasion from Italy or Turkey since you cannot attack boats on land and cannot intercept them when the move off shore.  This is a serious limitaiton and essentially give the Greek player no chance to win if Italy plays correctly.  Addendum to rules needed to allow interception of boats coming off shore to balance this.

RATING: 8
A civ game which doesn't really feel like a civ game.  Resources can only be bought by playing diverse groups of cards.  This requires a good deal of trading with everyone else while watching what everyone else is grabbing so you don't give them the win.    Some groups favor large amounts of trading (Atlantis), others minimal trading (Rome) and other want to sit back and collect tax (Egypt).  The trick for everyone is paying attention to what your neighbors will want you to do.

This is not one that we played very often, but it always feel like a special treat when we do.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Design which is ambitious (with expansion very ambitious) and trimmed at the same time.  On paper it's very clever, but when playing it's not so great.  I'm not able to pinpoint specific problems, I just don't feel such excitement and tension which I expect from euro-wargames.  Try 'Conquest of the Empire' if you look for something of that type.  CotE works better for me.

Interestingly the best game of Mare Nostrum for me was 3-player game...  I don't know if that's a rule, but that game was sweet.. Other (5-6 player) games were unfulfilling.  I wonder how it works with 4 players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game went over pretty good until we confirmed the rumours that Greece was too weak and too close to Rome, a double whammy. If you like games stalked full of special powers and multiplayer war-type games you should give this a try. 

I didn't really like the trading phase as I felt it really didn't add much EXCEPT length and the ability to 'create' a winner although after my second game it did appear the trading was a necessary evil. 

I did like how there wasn't really a turn order but rather how people in power decided who did what actions first, neat incentives here. Lots of tough decisions as you need everything and just can't get it, seems to be multiple paths with all the ways to grow in power whether with military, caravans, temples etc. War is a good option and implemented well, I like the rolling and rounding down of the dice, I think it minimizes the luck in the dice (like Serenissma) and want to implement it in some of my other games. I also like how the Fortress automatically rolls a 6 so it is a great asset for defense. I found it quite similiar Antike, VP's really is what you want not war but war can help you get them.  I do find the one ending to the game (which ended our game twice) where someone now acquires enough cards to be quite anticlimactic.

As mentioned Greece looks too weak and Rome and possibly Babylon too strong, the expansion fixes all this pretty good and adds a whack more special powers and a great  addition to the map for the 6th player
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is probably the best of the "civilization"-style board games.  I really like the card-based trade mechanism.  The civs are generally well balanced, although I think Greece is a little week.  War is a big part of the game, and tactical errors can be harshly punished.  The combat system is simple and works well.  While this is not a bad game, the decisions seem a little "programmed" at times; I've got to believe that there is still a better game on this theme out there to be made.

RATING: 7
Entertained. The components are excellent. The this well-considered well idea but it he fails in his conception. Elegant "Civ" type empire growing game. Up to five civilizations take in income from cities and commodities and reinvest them into military and passive expansion, reaping further income. Income is ultimately spent on Wonders and Heroes, which are required to win the game. Early days but this seems like good stuff. The endgame may have the problem of coming down to a popularity contest, but that should be fixable.

I liked the premise of the game but it seemed to have several flaws. 1) The trading mechanism is broken and no one ever initiated a trade in our entire 5 player game, 2) The various commodities have no individual purpose and would have been better off with numbers rather than names. Also the pictures of several of the commodities (wine, perfume, olive oil, etc) were far too similar. This led to confusion throughout the game. 3) The Romans ability to spawn cheap troops seems too strong and unbalanced. 4) The inability of naval units to impede naval invasions seems counter-intuitive and makes navies too weak. Overall, this game seems broken in it's current state.

Two of the three games I've played have ended in joint victories. The other one *might* have been a joint victory as well - I don't recall.  It's just too easy for this too happen.  The occasional tie in a game is fine, but for it to happen in >50% of the games is unacceptable.  This is sad because I like the game otherwise.  It's a decent "Civ-lite".

This is an under-appreciated game in my mind. I think it's beautiful and it works quite well. I like the main roles you can get, I like the trading round and how you can affect play with it...and the expansion set (and Greek blockade w/advanced Greek setup) works fantastically. 

I'm not sure why it gets knocked so much on the whole. It's a sleek design, has some very nice interactions of mechanisms, and it flows well. 

It's got a bit of chance, but I feel the strategy out weighs the chance. The die rolls feel well mitigated to me.

I really do think it's a pretty game. The production is very nice. 

Again, the expansion is a huge bonus, and highly recommended, but it is not required if you use the Greek Blockade rule (find it on the Geek) and the advanced set up for Greece in the base game. That said, get the expansion! :)

Initial rating - not sure of longevity but it deserves a couple more plays.  Worried that it may all boil down to trying to convince other players that someone else is winning and getting your timing right to just get over the finish line.  It also seemed very easy to take someone out.  If one person attacks you, then others may do so also to get there share of the spoils and you can be left in a non-recoverable position.
Acquisition of trading resources got a bit tedious and the whole trading phase was a bit long-winded.

After four plays, this game seems good, but not quite balanced.  Like many games of this type, frequently who wins depends on the quality of the players who are supposed to contest each other.

I'm torn between giving this a 6 or a 7. The game was definitely fun. Because there are so many variable power options, I think the big challenge is sticking with a strategy to win and not getting distracted by all the cool stuff you can buy. First play was a little slow with players pouring over the cards trying to figure out what to do next. I can see this getting better with more plays and more familiarity. Score could go up if that proves to be the case. Played with the expansion and I can't imagine playing without it.

RATING: 7.9
Played (with expansion) a couple of times.  Seems quite good but its not the civ-lite holy grail  :-)   Seems too short – games are a rush for VPs and the winner is the person who avoids conflict.  Interesting trading mechanic, techs, units etc but none of it really comes into play as much as it should.
--------------------------
Update:  Played 7 times now and its really working well - lots more combat, good fun.  Key is to make sure that an experienced player is Carthage!  NEVER succumb to the temptation to trade more than four cards during the commerce phase, unless you are certain to win on that turn!  Unlike Antike and Vinci, the theme is very strong here although it lacks that really 'epic' feel.
Important notes:  
1. more than any other game I know, a game of MN can be wrecked by one or more inexperienced players - I would put MN equal with Cluedo on this.  Regrettably, Its probably a major design flaw - you NEED to have someone pointing out an possible blunders from inexperienced players before they wreck the game.
2. play until someone gets a FIVE (not four) heros/wonders.  Makes it much better.
3. if you are using the expansion, make the Pyramids cost 13 not 12.  In fact, its better to make the Pyramids worth two 'honders' and NOT to make them an auto-win.  The auto-win thing just makes the whole game a tedious process of monitoring players in case someone can do it.
4. you MUST use the expansion, or make serious rule tweaks to help Greece out.
--------------------------
Update (11 games):  yes, this is the best civ-lite game.  I think its also my preferred light wargame, edging out Shogun now.  Serge got it right - its just a pity it take several games to realise it.  On further reflection the trading mechanic is very clever - it accomplished the objective without lengthy haggling.

A lot of the problem with inexperienced players can be reduced by making the pyramids worth two 'honders' towards winning, rather than an auto-win.  Yes, I know that the pyramids auto-win ability makes for rooly kewl come-from-behind wins, but that's only fun for about two games and then it gets annoying and the whole thing devolves into someone playing 'policeman' for Egypt.

Note that you CANNOT turtle and win unless the other players really mess up.  There will be war!
---------------------------------
Update (17 games)
Endgame IS a problem without a simple solution.  Inadvertent kingmaking will happen unless someone is continually pointing out how certain moves will result in a win for another player.

As good as multiplayer conflict games get for me, i.e. I would be willing to play this again. The rules itself are not very complicated and there are a few innovative ideas with the clever trading mechanism being the major one. Each turn, three roles (four with the expansion) are awarded to players fulfilling certain prerequisites best. The roles grant the right to be "master of ceremony" for the respective phase which is very attractive in most instances. Asymetric starting positions, many different heros and wonders, creatures and gods in the mythology expansion assure that the game won't get boring soon.
Mare Nostrum for now is worth exploring as I expect more than a simple bash the leader or popularity contest.

RATING: 8
Rate this 7 by itself, 8 with the Mythology expansion. Getting all of the elements of trading, civilization building and warfare into 2 hours is an inspired design. The minor balance issues seem to be worked out in the expansion, but there is a whole new set of hero cards that may or may not have their own balance issues. I've enjoyed it every time out.

RATING: 7
Pretty enjoyable in our first (six-player, with-expansion) game. I think we all played a bit too cautiously, and as a result it felt like the game ended earlier (with a win by me as Carthage with 12 resources and the Pyramids). The revised rules are pretty clear, though some issues do still crop up (some just with the cards, which is almost inevitable). I do think playing to 5 heroes/wonders or 13 commodities is almost necessary for the expanded game to stretch it out a bit. The main complaint raised was the difficulty of handling all the modifiers, which I personally didn't feel but I have something of a wargamey background. Components are lovely. The cycle of phases is pretty easy to master after a turn or two. I would definitely give this a go again, although I'm not sure how easy it'll be to draw in six again.

Another game with an attack the leader problem. To make matters worse in my first game I was clearly not the leader and was ganged up on. I don't find it particularly fun to receive or dish out this sort of attack - it sucks a lot of the real strategy out of a game and replaces it with psychological manipulation ("look at the victory points, that guy is so far ahead ...").

While many games suffer from that problem, this one also takes too long to learn for too little return. Twelve commodities is far too much to keep track of and slwos the game down unecessarily.

It could be more boring, if they were all too similar. Solid game. Love CivGames...

Based on 3 plays.  Even with the expansion, the game doesn't have all that much appeal to me.  Mare Nostrum promises grand strategy with soldiers, ships, resources, monsters, and cool special ability.  Yet we never got into it because the game ended right when things were getting interesting.  Increasing the cards needed for victory conditions might help, but the beginning of the game was already a drag.  In terms of the empire-building genre, I would recommend Shogun or even Nexus Ops instead of this.

1 partida.

Me recordó al Cyclades, porque tienes ejército y barcos que usas para atacar de una isla a otra, además de los dioses, que te dan distintos beneficios. Pero el Cyclades es muchísimo más bonito y con miniaturas, a parte de que no se hace tan largo.

Pero comparaciones a parte, me pareció un buen juego.

Acquired in 2003 and only played two games that year, and none since. I think the problem is that I can't find enough folks willing to sit down and play a four hour game that requires them to learn a whole bunch of rules. The game is beautiful! I like the different pieces and the general flow of the game except for the strange trading phase (the weakest part of the game). Also have the Mythology Expansion but haven't tried it yet. I'd really like to give this another go.

Update: Played twice more recently with the suggested rule modifications based on the expansion. Didn't complete either game, but I foresee more opportunities to play this.

[size=12][b]Why I dislike Mare Nostrum:[/b][/size]
- The game balance is off. Some of the factions are better than others.
- The building victory conditions took me out of the experience as I wanted to conquer at least one of my opponents regions but lost to a wonder. I could have probably built the wonder myself but conquering regions is far more interesting.

If you draw Greece (with 4 or 5 players), it's best to fold right away -> the game is only playable with 3 players, as Rome is removed from the game. Greece doesn't stand a chance against Roman legions.

With the Myth Expansion to this base game, my rating goes up to a 9.  Great production quality.  Nowadays, this is the closest I will get to playing a game like Diplomacy or (Adv.) Civilization.  With no time for an Advanced Civ marathon, this is a great Euro-style substitute, good with 4 and best with 5.  Interesting wargame tactics coupled with Euro-game trading/economic strategic choices (gaining the various roles and what to select from the bank of heroes & wonders to augment your civ).  You're usually never out of it b/c you can always go for the home run by building The Pyramids/12 Tax cards to win (by combo trade or build).  The others may create temporary alliancse to "trade embargo" the leader(s) during trading phases in order to stop momentum, keep someone from 12 Taxes, or from acquring too many Heroes & Wonders.

RATING: 5
We played six in my first play of this game which also included the mythology expansion.  I think this is one game that is really sensitive to new players not knowing what to do and how to play effectively which can lead to quick victories on the part of a couple different nations very easily if not contained from the beginning.  Not even one battle was fought in my game.  I'm not certain I want to revisit this game.

RATING: 6.5
This is an interesting game but ultimately not a favorite.  The game seems a bit too much a matter of making political deals with other players and is also highly subject to kingmaking.  I do enjoy the fact that each civilization must take very different actions in order to utilize its inherent strenghts and give it the best victory chances.  Unfortunately, the game does seem a bit unbalanced in favor of certain powers.

The number of articles and session reports posted here are daunting!  I can smell that this must be something very good.  Maybe later a PC version? 

The game subtely combines economics, politics and military expansion that you won't find when you are making one move or decision, in fact it has effects on the 3 aspects altogther.  Many design concepts are welded together and yet they are very distinct and easy to understand. The trading commodity system is the economic backbone for any empires and naturally some have more and some with less resources.  Others might have some unique resources to trade for tax income and some might have more resources (i.e. commodities) in common with others to trade for.  The resources are spent in a set of 3. 6, 9 or 12 cards, in which no duplicate resources should be in a particular set.  The commodities are exchanged for city infrastruture like market or temple, caravan for more resources, or the usual military stuffs (troop, triereme or forts) for threatening others.  Of course you can always combat by moving the military units into the same hex with your enemies.  

The game is won by whoever is the first to build the Pyramids by spending 12 different kinds of commodities in one set, or the first to obtain the 4 cards, in any combination of hero cards or World Wonder cards.  So basically you have to be good at maths in order to maximise your chances to build out of the most efficient use of the resources.  

Combat system is easy where a fort automatically scores a hit on a 6 in any defensive battle.  The no. of military units present determines the no. of die rolls you make.  Tallying the dieroll results and you eliminate one enemy unit for every 5 dieroll results score a hit to eliminate one enemy unit.  Sea battle is the same as the land combat.  Tiereme is also used to transport troops across different sea areas as long as they form a link in between 2 landmass.  

Each side has a special ability with their respective leader.  For example, the Roman cost one less comodity to build a legion and a fort, the Greek cost one less commodity to build a ship, the Babylonians can have one free influence (you can place your military unit in an influenced area, not necessariy out of a city), the Egyptians can trade one tax card for any commodity and vice versa, while the Carthaginan battles with a +1 to the dieroll total because of Hannibal.  If you played GMT's Pax Romana before, you can pretty much understand the general situation of the existing powers in the ancient Mediterranean area.    

We can play 2 games in an afternoon session and the pace of which should really depend on the types of players you get.  If you get people wanting to trade early on and large, the game could go faster.  Otherwise, a restricted trade would generally lead to a slower growth and thus a longer game.  And yet, what I talk about "long" here might only be an hour longer.  

I should say this is a masterpiece in Eurogames and I seldom like a Eurogame.  This should be the game for all those heeded for a deeper and less so abstract Eurogames.

Verdict: [b]Set sail![/b] This game provided another of the funniest moments of BGG.CON 2015 for me. After an hours long affair, I lost out to my good buddy on a literal coin toss to determine the winner when a third friend tossed a coin to choose his decision in being kingmaker at the game's end. I just had to laugh at the outcome, especially as I saw it coming a few moves earlier.

I've really grown to love this awesome game. The elegant mechanics just come together smoothly... so smoothly that most of the times in the last turns you forget about them and immerse yourself in the game, the feel and the interaction with other players. The whole game FEELS great, not truly EPIC as a "civilization building" game, but it feels as if you've acomplished something greater than "transforming cubes into other cubes". I think the Commerce Phase is what makes this game truly stand out.

I think I like MN more for its theme than its actual gameplay. I *WANT* to love this game but after around 5-6 sessions, it was made clear that some things are missing. A better play balance, a drop of chaos (event cards anyone? anything to make each game different..) and more strategies would all be welcome. Yes, it's SORT OF a Civilization Light, but a lot of what was good in Civ has been taken out. So try it if you can but dont expect the perfect game some have been raving about.

A new (2nd?)  Edition or that upcoming Expansion will probably fix these problems and push my rating from 7 to an 8 or even a 9...

Rating based on two plays.  I want to love this game, but I just can't.  The first game seemed to end just when it got interesting.  Second game with the expansion had very little interaction on the map as people were very tentative to attack.  This wasn't something I expected to happen.  Again, as things started to get interesting and interaction appeared imminent, the game was over when one player built his fourth wonder/hero.  Too many cards and having players read the text on all of those cards made the game drag.  As players gain more experience with the card text, no doubt the game would move more quickly, but my gaming time is too limited to invest in a game that has given me two lukewarm sessions in a row.  I wanted to love this game based on what it promises, but it failed to deliver and was traded away.

WITHOUT the EXPANSION, NOT THAT GOOD:
My third time playing this was the charm.  The first two times (one without the expansion), the game suffered from at least one player not knowing what they were doing.  This is a game that is best played with the right group of gamers who can think, and, it helps very much to have at least three people play who've played before.  It takes time, but with 6 using the expansion, it really shines.  I'm so ready to play again (I've yet to win it).  GAME NEEDS THE EXPANSION!!!

RATING: 1
With many good proposal, I've played only once this game, that has been revealed a fiasco. Twenty years of playtesting didn't prevent to have unreapairable superiority from the 1st turn.
I had Rome, builded markets and caravans to have all resources exploited, with the "Game Expert" saying me that I was wrong since Rome has to follow a military way. Having 3 regions with 2 resource each, you'll be granted a massive commercial power (forcing Egypt to fade away asking Commerce 0 or forcing the Papire with an high number of Commerce), a huge army and the better acquisitions.
Maybe 1 game is too little, true, but that game (that the Italian "game driver" called as "badly influentiated by a strange Rome way of play) results in an Overlording of my Rome from the 1st to the last turn.
I burned and Annexed Athens and Cartago if I remember clearly, with no chanches for the opponents to strike me back while I acquired resources for the  Winning Wonder bought.
The better strategy is the winning one... does playtesters ever think to this chanche?

My final Opinion: Avoid this Game.

Very elegant rules that provide lots of depth and strategy without too much complexity, which is good, and without any book-keeping, which is even better. What they did not provide in our first trial run was a fast game, as we needed about 5 1/2 hours. The second game took only 3 hours (including explanation of the rules), which increased my rating a notch. I need to play this more often, but getting exactly five players (who, for this game, have to be more than casual gamers) is not so easy, apparently.

Some interesting ideas, that seem a little dated and half baked now. I will play this more but I worry that the war game on the map part of this is a side show to the collecting of goods/ buying the victory.

The art is very good, and gameplay is decent except for a severe bash-the-leader problem.

Civilization-themed games are usually problematic because they reward ganging up on those who are (thought to be) about to win, even if they are willing to live and let others live. I don't like games that reward whining and appearing to be weak.

RATING: 8
Unadulterated multi-player conflict challenge set beautifully in a wider tactical civilisation building theme and all wrapped up in three hours or less. No, it's not balanced and yes, there is kill-the-leader and gang-up-on-your neighbour but when the game is three hours or less, that's just part of the fun! Lots of tactical options and asymmetry to explore should make this a game with a good shelf-life. Combat ought to be marginally more exciting than it is and the use of artificial building and troop limits to drive the game is vaguely irritating but otherwise very good. Makes a nine played with the expansion. See my reviews for more details: http://fortressat.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1238

I have since reduced this a little, because of issues that I have about balance - namely, the game is too hard on Greece -  though these have been addressed in the expansion, the basic game still suffers.

Played three-player games on 02/17/07, 05/12/07 & 08/04/07.  The game has some serious flaws and a few ambiguous rules. There seem to be several rules/mechanisms that are unique, not because they're superior, but "just because". And they usually have the effect of slowing the game down. A few specifics follow. I found the trading process cumbersome. The limited amount of influence and caravan markers made the game take longer. As for the graphics, mostly they were fine. But the color scheme of the markets/caravans and cities/temples were too similar to differentiate at a distance. And a very big flaw, Egypt easily won every game due to its tax breaks. After three disappointing games I lowered my rating form a 5 to a 4. I see no need to ever play Mare Nostrum again.

Update: 23.07.2007 - too bad this requires too much from players to maintain its masterpiece status. The first hour is always very good gaming but then the game turns into "hose the leader"-contest which is sadly boring. The different win conditions (score track implementation maybe?) could help.

Rating based on one play.  Had a great time.  I like this one.  Seems part Euro part Ameri... There's a bit of civilization building, bit of war game.  Lots of player interaction.  Opportunity for "screw-you" moments.  Players can gang-up and players can be (nearly) eliminated, but this isn't so bad with the right crowd and if players focus on making the best play, not revenge. Love the theme.

I'm not really sure about this game yet. Played it once with the new rules and some veterans were still complaining about Greece and Rome being unable to "win on their own". Board and bits are beautiful and the overall game is nice. Just seems more difficult for Greeks and Romans to pull off a win by themselves. Will play more using new rules to better evaluate.

What initially struck me about Mare Nostrum was the sheer amount of game- and strategy-changing actions one can take.  Between different heroes/wonders, god actions, and commericial/military options, no two games will ever be the same.  Among veteran players it will probably come down to a game of efficiency -- given a starting condition (nation), which player can most efficiently get on track to a victory condition.  As a fan of long, drawn out games, MN also takes the cake (it's no Civilization, but it doesn't end quickly, either!!).

Hmm. Kind of strange. Being purely into resources or into taxation seems to ramp up quickly to wonders, heroes, and the win. Having some of both kind of sucks. Also it sucks to be next to the Romans... poor Greek.

The discount on legions is really strong, also because it uses up spare resources. Otherwise, only full multiples of three are useful. Maybe it could be nerfed to getting three legions for the price of two.

I really enjoyed the game the first time I played it. However, the next session was with five players and took five hours - it was way too much. The game, as I see it, has an endgame problem: about 75% of the game is endgame, and it just doesn't end. Players keep on beating the leader, until somebody gets a lucky break or the others get so bored they won't stop the winner. It's a pity, because I like the art and I like the system.

Avoid.

The good - it has civ elements, like conquest and trade.  I really like the trade mechanic - I think it's the best part of the whole game.  There are lots and lots of options.  The bad - Really, really fiddly, what with all the trading back and forth of cards.  Combat seems very minor compared to economic growth.  The endgame really just sneaks up on you and jumps out there - I can't imagine a game going on for more than eight turns.  I don't know, I probably wouldn't play again unless asked, but it wasn't awful.

I want to play some more before settling on a rating, but the pyramid auto-victory really kills the fun in this game for me. The game almost always seems to come to a too rapid conclusion. It may just be the group I've been playing with, though, who lean towards ridiculously large trading rounds.

RATING: 5
Mare Nostrum does a good job of capturing the civilization building feel in a streamlined way.  The locations and civilizations are historically inspired, and each one feels and plays differently, which is a bonus for replayability.  The game isn't too short, so you do feel like you can create a plan and implement it, but it doesn't overstay its welcome either.

On the downside, the game does seem a little unbalanced.  It is certainly harder to win with Greece, and Carthage and Babylon benefit from being near the edge of the board on each side.  In addition, each of the civilizations (other than Greece) have a hard time doing anything other than what they are good at, and are sort of designed to do.  They can feel a little programmed at times.  The game is certainly fun, and there is some interesting strategy and some good confrontations, but it doesn't hold the greatest depth.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Just what I've been looking for since I played Civilization. It really bothers me those 12 hours of play, but Mare Nostrum scratches the same itch under 4 hours giving you a much more fresh gaming experience. This is a solid game which I hope to be playing for many years from now. Commerce is awesome, perhaps the part of the game I like the most. I would give this game a 9, but is the Mythology Expansion the element that pushes this game that high on my ranking. If if weren't mandatory the 6 players to enjoy, this game clearly would be a 10.

RATING: 6
Up to 5 countries (Rome, Greece, Carthage, Babylon and Egypt) compete for scarce resources. Armies, fleets and fortresses can be built to defend or invade. A 2 hr game that is not difficult to play. However, Rome seems to have an advantage over the other countries, since they are close to 7 or 8 different commoditites. The game also progresses on what your neighbors do; if one person builds an army, you are almost forced to, but the other players go ahead in production, while you fall behind. Based on an apparent disparity between nations (though I personally don&#039;t mind the challenge of trying to play Greece, for example), the unpredictable intentions of neighbors, the game just doesn&#039;t work well. The trading phase reshuffles commodity cards around, which benefits others, and can hurt you, and most of it maybe beyond your control. An ambitious game that I think everyone wants to like, but has limitations.

If you, like many people, are looking for a Civilizationish game that doesn't take all day to play, I would urge you to check out Mare Nostrum, with the understanding that ALL players need to give the game their full attention and choose their battles carefully if a good time is to be had.  [i]Mare Nostrum is NOT the simple build-and-fight game it appears to be.[/i]

If you don't have the expansion, I recommend using the alterations to the civilization-specific heroes for a more balanced game.  (This means Pericles comes with a free ship, Hannibal comes with a free legion, and Julius Caesar reduces the cost of legions but not fortresses.)

RATING: 6
Mare Nostrum started out as an interesting challenge but quickly lost its luster.  It fails as a civilization game because the theme is too watered down.  It fails as a wargame because the combat rules make effective war impossible to wage.  It fails as a trading game because the trade dynamic, though clever, is one-dimensional.  My greatest gripe about the game is that each civilization has a set strategy that it MUST follow (including who it should ally with) in the beginning else the game is thrown off kilter.

----
Update 

Gave this one a fairer shake and it benefited from it.  It's quick, interesting, and the fact that each civ has a different path it needs to follow is a feature, not a flaw.  The expansion is a must, IMO.  Get it Get it Get it.

----
Update

Still a 7.  The learning curve here keeps it from going higher.  Until I can get more playes in with the same people so we all know where the game is and, most importantly, how to prevent an early victory, 7 is where it stays.

---update---
Still a 7, but significantly more enjoyable when the game has time to develop.  Endgame has issues that may need to be house-ruled to make more satisfying.  This has potential to crack 8 if those issues can be overcome.  Won't go higher, though.  A few-times-a-year game.

---update---
Those aforementioned end-game issues?  They can't be overlooked.  They cast too great a shadow over what is otherwise a brilliant game.  If only determining who wins could be made more satisfying (which is to say, satisfying at all.)

I like the trade mechanic, the fact that you can actively mess with other people's plans makes it useful. Having the leaders choose the order for trade, building and war adds another layer of strategy to the game. The fact that it's a bit unforgiving makes the player really have to think, unless they want to lose all of their territory and be out of the game. You should always be thinking about how to get nine cards to trade in for a wonder/hero. Just having a big army doesn't really help much.

I think there should be a tie breaker instead of having it simply be the first person who builds wins. It's too easy for there to be a situation where two people can build for a win, and a third person gets to decide who wins. I'm just not fond of that situation cropping up in games.

Unbalanced wonders/heros. Need to overpower to have a chance to win any battle, while leaving other areas unguarded. Inability to truly plan your building strategy due to the trading method. Having said trading method take for-god-damned-ever since everyone has to now calculate exactly what they need, and what everyone else needs and try and figure out exactly what to take from whom and when.  No, I don't want to play this again.

I was negatively biased going into the game, but I actually had fun playing it... the first time.

The components are ok, the meeples are quite fine. The graphic design is average (not bad, but the good cards could be a bit more different; there are a few that are very similar).

It has some fine mechanics (the control of the sea gives you plenty of options, but it doesn't make you untouchable at all, the commerce phase, even if long, becomes interesting in the second half of the game, the political, economic and military chief mechanic is powerful and cool, etc.), but it also has presents some issues: rich gets richer, possibility of gangbanging, game is too long (if you fall behind early, you're lost and doomed to a boring long game), and 3 important ones:
-> Winning is quite difficult. You actually need some bad playing from your opponents during the commerce phase (or a political/military evident superiority). 
-> It's very easy to block certain players from winning. Just choose some resource they don't control and don't offer it during the commerce phase. The only way to win will be to buy 4 wonders (hard) or buy the Pyramids with coins, something that favors a lot civilizations, like Egypt or Greece, that have many coin resources close.
-> Not well balanced. Artemis is much more powerful than any other wonder. Basically, it multiplies your chances to win by 5 at least. Cleopatra is by far the best leader... There are many, many differences between heroes and wonders.
-> Promotes passivity. Usually, attacking means leaving your doors open for a third player to come into the heart of your empire. You can easily lose more than you'll gain.

It also has another big issue: the administration time is insanely huge. Handing out the resoruces to every player, every round, becomes a nightmare at certain point.

I think age has not treated this game well. The idea is good, but the actual gameplay is long and messy. Other games after this have corrected some of these issues with new mechanics. After all, how many games are there about trading/combat in the Mediterranean?

An interesting game, with great board and components, but one that demands experienced players to maintain a balance of power.  For instance, a weak or inexperienced Carthage player can inadvertantly hand the game to Rome if he doesn't maintain his control over trade, and any player can skew the trading round if he or she doesn't pay attention.  Heroes poorly balanced -- Helen of Troy is much too powerful and always taken first.  Feels like this game was playtested by the same group over and over again, without input from new players.  Not in any hurry to play again, but hopeful for Mythology expansion.

Gioco interessante ma molto determinante dalla fase delle contrattazioni e anche dal kingmaking. Come in tanti giochi di questo genere (Risiko, Shogun, Scythe) conviene non attaccare, stare in difesa, coltivare il proprio orticello cercando di non dare nell'occhio. Un vecchio gioco che porta i segni del tempo. Esiste una versione nuova che prova a rifarsi il trucco cercando di sembrare più moderno ma non riuscendo in toto nei sui propositi.

It is a game with warfare, and players can get crushed. But I still think its a good game. It plays fairly fast for this type of game, and has serveral interesting mechanics. The rules are also easy to learn, but I suggest checking out the FAQ. Advanced setup with 4 phases buing 9 points at a time is a good variant. That way you can let Greece buy last, and let them decide what to do against the Rome Legion threat.

I like the design, which for me was easy to understand and smooth to enact. 

It also seems to me that the design concept is balanced, in that, although players must lead with civilization-building (via trading and construction/expansion), at a certain point it's also in their interest to act militarily to prevent another civilization from becoming too developed or powerful. 

The rulebook is a rarity in that it's well written, and the player aid sheets are very helpful for set-up and for reference. 

Looking forward to playing this more and developing various strategies (plus I have the expansion).

Jeu de conquête, commerce, diplomatie dans le bassin méditerranéen tout comme le Méditerranée de Dominique Ehrhard. Les graphismes (cartes et plateau) sont vraiment magnifiques

Quelques similitude entre les 2 jeux :
- il faut des ressources différentes pour espérer emporter la victoire
- le système de combat est relativement proche

Mare Nostrum est un excellent jeu qui apporte un peu de rebondissements avec ces héros et ces constructions (avec chacun un pouvoir particulier), mais ... malheureusement certains personnages semblent avantagés (il vaut mieux être égyptien ou babylonien que grec ou carthaginois). De plus, au bout d'1 à 2 heures de jeu, certains joueurs savent pertinemment qu'ils ne pourront pas gagner (alors qu'il reste encore quasiment autant de temps de jeu). Au bout du compte, ces perdants "décident" qui va gagner en attaquant ou pas l'un des joueurs en tête. Dommage pour un jeu de cette ampleur, en espérant que la version 2014 modifie tout cela ...

Similar to Diplomacy, but it removes all the things that sets Diplomacy apart. Two simple units - fleets and armies. Rich get richer by investing in supply centres cum cities / caravans. They get closer to winning. Everyone gang up on them, knock them down to size. Then pick on the next tall poppy. And basically hope that you're the last poppy picked on. But all the diplomacy is overt - there's no rush of intrigue, of will he or won't he join forces and turn on the leader, no revelation, surprise or drama. And the broad reach provided by the galleys exacerbates the problem because anyone can hit anyone. Perfect if you like pound 'em games, not so otherwise. The game is nicely crafted and all, but the ebb and flow just seems too severe for me here.

I have only about 20% of one game completed. We had to stop due to rules confusion and a missing pieces dilemma (someone else's copy).  

From that experience, plus reading rules, I think with a good learning game, I will likely enjoy this game very much.

Mine is a heavily pimped out copy with the plastic army/navy pieces and cardboard influence discs from Conquest of the Empire. Fortresses are stolen from Lego.

I will play this game any time, any where. I love this title. I have twice played it in family tournments with Risk as the starter, and this as the serious game. I have hosted nights just to play this one. There are a couple of rules (Rome's fortresses should cost 3) that may need to be tweaked for balance, the French author appears to be hard at work at this and an expansion...

I found it annoying that Greece is underpowered and Rome is overpowered. Updated rules in expansion help this a little. Sometimes unbalanced games can be fun with experienced players.

Have on 'want' list as I could use an extra copy  for playing 5-player, I have the expansion mixed into my regular copy. I also have a copy framed and on the wall of my game room.

Oct 2014: This was one of my favorite games for a long time. I organized more than one game party as an excuse to get this one to the table. I played it with some serious hobby folks, and some non-hobby gamers. It did well. It's beautiful, and I just wish the expansion did not muddy it up with the mythology stuff. I tried to mash together the base game rules with portions of the expansion that made sense to me, but then teaching it becomes more of a headache, as I have to moderate.

One big flaw to this game is the fact that if Egypt is not "controlled" by the players at the table, they can easily run away with a win. If you don't like games where one player will will if not kept under control, you should avoid this game. Twice I've seen Egpyt win for this reason, and noone was happy about it, even the player that one, because it felt "cheap".

I believe that there is some great stuff to explore here, but I don't think this one holds up to a lifetime of play. I am dropping to 6 because of this.

The game is a "9" in graphic design.

I know lots of people will not enjoy this long time game, but for me it got everything needed. Build an empire, negociate with others, fight for a purpose and not just to fight. The new version is more balance but I still love the ancien one particulary with extension (mythology creature)

Looks very pretty but it was not what it seemed (a territory war game) but a card collecting game. I spent 3 hours in one small corner of the board collecting sets of 9 cards to get heroes. I got the heroes but also got bored. Have played 2 times now, I wont be playing it again. Thank god I did not buy it. and what (ronjon) said

Excellent game, oozing with theme, that really submerges the players in the ancient civilization leader role. 

Each civ is different and needs a different approach to succeed. Needs at least five players to really shine. The base game has some balance issues which were fixed in the expansion (and it's possible to use some of the rules of the expansion in the base game to correct these problems). 

Inexperienced players can throw away the game (most of the time to Egypt) and ruin everybody's experience because some of the powers are in key positions and their actions have not obvious implications. I think that's why it doesn't get a higher rating in this site. 

Avoid giving Carthague to the newbie, clearly explain all the implications of the trade process and how Egypt can win if people aren't careful during this phase and you should be ok. 

When played with a group of competent players, this is an absolute incredible experience. No game that I know can deliver the same amount of tension, involvement and an epic feeling of building a powerful civilization in the same time frame. This is a masterpiece in game design. 

Rating is for the base game plus expansion.

(3 plays)  We played our second game with 4 players on the 6 player map.  Not recommended.  I'm thinking it's a 5 or 6 player game, and with 5 players don't use the Atlantis map.  It was still fun - but the game just didn't quite work with neutral provinces - again.  Unbalanced.  Still, we'll give it another try with the correct number of players next time.  I still like it enough.  The Mythology Expansion seems a worthwhile improvement.  My biggest problem with the game is that it's too difficult to "see" the game state by looking at the board.  There is constant re-evaluating and counting cards to figure out who is close to winning, and it takes too long to figure it out.  It slows things down too much and makes the game much less fun.  I finally decided to trade it away.

Could be a great game.  I just thought it was not that much fun.  Maybe I had my expectations high on the whole idea that this was a civ-lite and war game-like.

I liked this game at first, but it didn't stand up under repeated plays.  A lot of neat systems and ideas interacting, but the sum of all the parts isn't much.  After winning accidentally (by trade), I realized how fragile this game was; it's too easy to win and too hard to prevent someone from winning without making the game drag.  Also, war is useless; if player A attacks player B, he has ensured player B will be set back, but is setting himself back, too.  War is too expensive, trade is too powerful and the game is a little too fiddly.

Update: After a long time away from the game, a recent play of the base game reinforces the balance (and other) issues. However - the expansion appears to fix many of these problems. Unfortunately this is still Settlers on steroids.



I enjoyed this game when it was first published; it seemed to be THE Civ replacement.  Upon repeated plays however, I find it nothing more than a Settlers variant (and not a very good one). Combat is pointless; the nations are so unbalanced that the real game takes place before the first piece hits the board - who gets to play which nation. If this game required 20 years to develop then it was done on a very part-time basis.

After a year of ownership I finally had the chance to play this game with 5. Although I have the expansion, we wanted to get a taste for the game as created to see how supposedly unbalanced it was. I must say I agree that the game is unbalanced as originally created. I played the Greeks, so my view may be skewed. The Greek player will have a tremendous uphill battle because he is sandwiched on both sides by powerful kingdoms. Perhaps if the designers had given him a powerful hero to negate that it would have been easier. However, he also has one of the weakest heroes in my opinion. Perikles allows him to build cheaper navies, but few other players even had any navies to start with. They were busy expanding to grab resources, while Greece has to spend her time building legions and fortresses to dissuade Rome from destroying her right at the start. Rome and Babylon definetely seemed more powerful than the other kingdoms, especially Egypt and Greece. We are looking forward to trying it with the expansion. The game itself, the design and mechanics, the artwork, production and combat were all well received.

First impression:
Good game that is not to be taken as a wargame. Of course there are battles, but those are not mandatory to win the game. Lot of interaction between players. The expansion is definitively bringing a much needed player to fill the gap between the Roman player and the Carthage player on the standard board. The rules are easy to read and to understand. The main problem is that I can't see myself playing that game with less than 6 players. The 5 player set up is the most detrimental has two players have only one nearsided opponent has the three other player have 2 opponents. The rules are clear, the mechanic of the game is simple, the game plays rapidly for this type of game and still I might put it up for trade.

Première impression:
Bon jeu qui ne doit pas être confondu avec un jeu de guerre. Bien sure il y a des batailles mais elle ne sont pas obligatoire afin de gagner la partie. Il y a beaucoup d'interaction entre les joueurs. L'extension apporte le support d'un sixième joueur très bien venu pour combler le manque entre le joueur Carthare et Romain sur le plateau. Le problème principale est que sont optimum est à 6 joueurs. Le jeu à 5 joueurs est le plus désavantageux alors que deux des cinqs joueurs n'ont qu'un opposant près de leurs frontières alors que les trois autres sont pris en sandwich entre deux opposants. Les règlements sont claires, la mécanique est simple, le jeu se joue rapidement pour ce type de jeu et encore je ne suis pas sure de vouloir le garder.

RATING: 9
GREAT game! I can't understand why everybody is not in love with this game. It is not a 10 because it really needs 5 (maybe 4) players.

Still, the game is very simple, very interesting, conflict feels just right and it definetly is not the main course to victory, but it sure can bring down a powerful player.

Even if the game is a bit long, the time spent with it is worth it, it is great fun.

good things about this game: (1)the board looks gorgeous, (2)the meeples are seriously cool, (3)the amount of variable powers available in the form of heroes and gods give the players a variety of options and the game a nice amount of variability.what i don't like about the game: (1)you need a full compliment of players, and the expansion to balance the game.  (2)the trading system is boring and dumb. i feel like if the trading could have been handled more like the trading in settlers  (i can't believe i'm saying this), it would have gone a long way to holding the leader in check. as it stands the ability to punish the leader in this area is not as easy to do as it should be. that ties into (3)the only way to prevent a runaway leader is for the other players to hold her in check militarily. however, the first player to do so, makes themselves venerable to the other players who may take advantage of a poor outcome. so basically in this game, a player is punished by playing well and smart. i feel like there are better games of this type to devote 2-3 hours to.

One solo play.  Exactly the sort of game that I get excited about, but you seem to run out of cities etc. quite early on, so it forces you on a conflict path before I felt like I'd finished building up my civilisations.

A very good ancient conflict game.  A good balance of economic and conquest-based victory conditions.

A civilization/war game with barely any civilization or war. Actually sounds very appealing to someone like me. The resource acquisition and management in this game is what really interests me.

RATING: 7
A fun, fairly lightweight game combining civ-building with a little bit of battle. (Reminiscent of Antike, in fact.) Beautiful board and cards, fairly simple rules for a game of its type. Has elements of negotiation, leader-bashing, and king-making, which I mention as a warning to those who object to that sort of thing--I liked it. Not much luck involved, although you do roll dice in the occasional combat. Lots of player chaos if you have a full 5-player session. Many people claim that it is unbalanced without its "Mythology" expansion, but I haven't played enough to have a valid opinion about that.

Another decent entry in the Risk "super-family".  The trading is probably the most interesting feature provided the trade leader is relatively cunning.  The rest is fairly standard but all fits together OK.  Doesn't do anything to damp leader-hitting, so the games tends to be a peaceful race for a few turns and then a blood bath of "pile on the leader". Fun every once in a while.  Haven't played the expansion enough to know for sure, but seems like it might be over-chroming the chassis.  The God cards add even more "take that" to the game which is not a good thing in my opinion.  Genuinely fairly simple and plays in less than 3 hours.

Played it once and liked it a lot. Already knew and liked Mundus Novus, which uses the card trading mechanics of this game.

A fantastic civilization building game.  Each of the civs by nature of its location and resources has a different path to victory.  This adds to the replay value.  The artwork is some of the best ever seen in a game.  My only problem with the game is that it is SO balanced, that kingmaking and ties can be a problem in the endgame.  That can be kind of frustrating in a 3 hour game.  

The expansion seems to do a good job addressing this (although not explicitly with any new endgame condition).  With the expansion, it's a 9.

As you have seen elsewhere the rules can be ambiguous in spots.  We just tried to use common sense and the FAQ to interpret the rules.  Otherwise the components are top notch, the art is really good(there were many compliments on that), and the gameplay is fairly smooth.  As with any game of Mare Nostrum's ilk, there can be a fair amount of analysis paralysis between turns.  My only complaint is with the setup/players aid sheets for each civilization.  They are just made out of plain paper :( !  Thick cardboard would have been nice.  Otherwise, the theme is fantastic and very well done.  Just think "Risk" meets "Settlers" and you will have the general idea of gameplay.

We finally got to play this and it was a good time.  The rules work well, but I'm looking forward to trying the expansion.  We tried it with the expansion the other day and the play seemed very similar to the other times we have played.  Typically if you end up bordered by a couple of opponents they work on eliminating you and while that is happening another player uninvolved in the wars takes off and wins the game so the game play has not been as much fun with repeated plays.

I had high hopes on the game as it had been sitting on my shelf for several years.We played a 5+ hour game with six players and the mythology expansion. We had several wars going on and the game went back and forth. One player got eliminated and there was not much trading going on. Maybe with less aggressive style of play and more focus on the racing part (who is able to built the heros/wonders/the pyramids the fastest the game would have been more enjoyable. Anyways it's hard to see this hit the tablein the future again.

I was very disappointed by this game.  it's got some nice artwork, some obvious talent went into its design, i like the theme and could tell a lot of care went into it, and I love when a game can be adequately explained in a few short pages with decent illustration and not get too wordy (usually a good sign, especially for a rich/complex looking thing such as this).  However, something here just doesn't work. The rules are all there, but they somehow don't explain everything too well (no major issues, though).  The mechanics work, but they don't flow.  The parts and components are all pretty good, but they aren't really all that necessary, in the end.  They seemed like window-dressing for a game that fundamentally didn't click.  I don't know...reminds me of a pretty cake that tasts like marshmallow nothing. I'll play again, but was really just not enthralled with it.  Parts of it (like the trading and the end game conditions) seemed added on.  Maybe I'm bitter because my expectations were too high, but this went back on the shelf quickly and that's usually not a good sign.  And I won!  I don't recommend this game for people who aren't die hard for resource/trade/conquest games.  I think I might rather play Risk...and I loathe Risk.  Extra +0.5 for the component quality (which is excellent) and the general ambition of the game.  The combat mechanic *was* somewhat inventive.

Mare Nostrum and I are not two who get along real well. I had actually forgotton all about it when I made this list originally. Wishful thinking. I think that this game is pretty boring, and can actually get too tedius to even remotley come close to enjoying. Nothing like an Empire Building game, like some say, although it's mechanics are Waro. As I remember it, players start as different ancient civilisations, and move around the board starting cities in different countries. I think. Every country they own, they can collect resources from. Now you don't get to keep any resources, so all the counting and deciding what everyone gets, then paying for armies and such, then putting all of it right back....just....makes me wanna tear my face off. Although, I do believe that the combat and combat resolution was pretty interesting, and the pieces were all nice. I think the endgame might have been flawed though. First to collect x amount of World Wonders wins.

I love the idea of empire building games, but until now, I haven't really found one that totally appeals to me.

MN does. I really enjoyed the varying nature of the role cards. I really enjoyed the trading, which I think will become quicker and deeper as my group plays this game more.

The combat is intresting and does give you ways to mitigate the random roll of the dice, if you so wish.

Love the production work.

For the sake of hurrying up the game maybe there should be a rule requiring trading at least one card per turn. Pity some of the rules are vague.

It has nice, easy and original mechanichs that let you experience everything that an empire building game needs to approach:  Heroes, Military, Religion, Trade and Edifications.  Perhaps my initial rating is a little rash because only with several plays it can be said if the game suffers of balance issues, such as may happened in one of our games, in which two players weakened a common neighbour.  Nevertheless, it doesn't seem so at first impression.  Besides, the [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/17099][i]Mythology Expansion[/i][/url] does  help in this matter.  Although, it may suffer of [i]kingmaker[/i] problems, since it is possible that two or more players have the cards to win in the building phase, and a third one, the Political Leader, has to decide who wins.

After 2 plays, I give it a solid 6.5, I expect it will actually go up, but I will hold back until I get to 5 plays. Update:
I don't think this game will make more than 5 plays. To long for what you get out of it. I find myself avoiding this game. April 2006, played with expansion and did enjoy it more. I see this as a once/twice a year game.

This one does seem to live up to its goal of simulating civilization in a shorter time span... the interactions and mechanisms are both interesting and run smoothly. As has been noted having 12 commodities can make it awkward to get them all into your hand, but perhaps dividing each stack into two for each side of the board might help if there is sufficient playing space.

At first it seemed like greece had a disadvantage but greece&#039;s naval power is quite strong and can rule the seas... and babylon has few armies. If Rome does attack Greece at full strength things can be tough however Carthage to the south should be engaged as well. Would like to see the errata also. 

As a side comment, the game is superbly crafted and beautiful to behold.

The various ancient Mediterranean games all have a certain similar feel.  The resource mechanic of Mare Nostrum is certainly interesting, but doesn't seem to really promote conflict.

Enjoyable light-civ/light-war that wraps in 30min per player. Undone by terrible rules-writing and a couple of antiquated ideas.

I like war in the Mediterranean, but wish the empires could have been contemporaneous.

The rules, when written and implemented correctly, are clean. A 'boss' of each phase of the game, a 'trading' phase that is basically white elephant, and Ameritrash-style building + moving that doesn't take too long because everybody's kinda poor. Clever way in implementing resources.

Ameritrash that is as pure as it gets, with the only minor Euro influence being game time, which is a godsend.

Great game.  It plays a lot differently that I was expecting.  I went into it expecting the military option to be the way to win, but as it turns out the military is meerly an instrument.  As the game quickly turns into a military stalemate a solid, diverse economy is much more important than troops for the most part.  Definitely some heavy strategy late in the game as well.  I have played a 3 player game so far and it was mostly balanced.  Really looking forward to the chaos of a 5 player game.

A good game for a big group. Lots of chances to argu...er "negotiate." The biggest flaw I find is that the game relies exclusively on the players to maintain balance and keep it from being all over in a few turns, so when it's good, it's very very good, but when it's not, it's kind of a let down.

Ah, a civilization game. One of the best game types. This is a mix of civilization, clash of cultures, and age of mythology. The trading aspect is very unique and allows you to attempt to manipulate the game in your favor if done properly. It's difficult... but it can be done.

Expand quickly, gather your taxes and win through building the pyramids!

The strategies for the various cultures are slightly scripted, but the strong theme and abundant choices are good compensation. The rules are simple, yet interesting, and they encourage negotiation and interaction. The card trading mechanic is novel and fun. Mare Nostrum is not as balanced or as elegant as Antike, but it is more fun to play when it's working. The game can be unpredictable and end either too quickly or much too slowly. Definitely best with 5 players, with some of the rule modifications from the expansion for play balance.

RATING: 7
For me it felt more like an empire building (but a decent one at that) than a civ game. Making wonders is not quite enough. As it is impossible to win without some co-operation it also reminds me of Diplomacy. The rules are solid, but I thought that trading although sometimes crucial is more often pointless.

RATING: 5
First play wasn't overwhelming. The game has some nice ideas, the trading is kind of fun, the way you use resources to build is also neat. The concern is that with so much going on, and so much ability to whack the leader, the winner is the person that is doing well at the point where exhaustion kicks in. Which obviously means I didn't win, so my opinion has to be taken with a grain of salt.

Thematically I thought the mythological creatures and the Gods were disappointing. The creatures more so when looking at the board because they look ridiculously large compared to triremes and legions. Also they represent such different creatures but all look the same.

The Gods were just madness. I can whack a guys caravan from across the board, then I can build that caravan myself. Not sure why but that is how I have to get more caravans. Just a little off.

I guess it is because the picture of the huge boat on the box looks awesome. From that I thought I'd get a slightly euro civ game that played in two hours. Instead it was more mythological, and very swingy. Also very fiddly to track resources. Annoyingly fiddly even with the aids. 

In saying all that, I would play it again. Like most games it would get better after multiple plays, and being able to read the state of the game would get easier. My rating is still valid for a long five player first play. That experience was five out of ten. The score could go to seven with more familiarity. I want to like a game with that artwork on the box.

The changes posted on BGG to the base game fix balance issues, in my opinion. I really, really like this game. It's a bit of a cross between Civ & Game of Thrones. A fun, strategic multiplayer. Might be my fav multiplayer strategy game.
There's a bit of dice rolling, but not enough to make it super random, and I likethat because a bit of dice rolling can be fun!
There's negotiations and threats (depending on the players) and that's fun!
Ther's jockeying for position and localized neighborhood conflicts, but still the ability (unlike civ or Adv Civ) to stike at a country or region across the map relatively easily!

FUN and still strategic! 

I like this more than Wallenstein & El Grande (two of my fav multiplayer euro strategy/conflict games), and even Adv Civ (Adv Civ playtime is too long most of the time).

Great board design and color.  The meeples look great, but then why they throw those terrible city, caravan, market, and temple tiles that look the same and blend into the board is beyond me.  Trading is a bit laborious, but strangely kind of cool, that said there really isn't any way to control what you get if no one feels that your goods are worthwhile, or if they are just putting the kaibash on trading with you.  It seems that it is too easy to lose everything that has been built up with one bad diceroll, so the work is just too high for how easy it is to have it all taken aways from you.
 
Ok, after playing this again, the game suffers from some real problems.  They system requires everyone to keep each other in check.  You are required to pick on a leader that you determine by constantly monitoring everyone, even if it means falling farther behind just so that you don't lose outright.  This makes for a tedious endgame.  The closed holdings are retarded as people can just count what you have, so there is never any guile in trading.

The game also suffers a bit in that I never have turn angst.  If find the decisions a little obvious, with the most of your choices in how you shop.  The rest is left up to the conul of all players who aren't the leader and the dice. 

That and without the rules in the expansion, the imbalance of Rome & Greece create an even more predictable game.  Rome clobbers Greece, Carthage gets antsy, Rome clobbers Carthage, Babylon almost wins from taking Greece's land, but the Egytian taxes buy the victory.

This game started out hot but my desire to play has cooled with time - I have found that the auction is too easily manipulated and those focused on the economics tend to have an easier path to victory.  In the other hand, I am wondering if our play group is now at the edge of a precipice where the added knowledge everyone has of the heroes and the mechanics could lead us into a new appreciation of it ... that is when we will know if this game shines or not ...

Have now played twice, and both times I was left somewhat underwhelmed.  I think there's an excellent game here, but the sheer volume of choices in regards to heroes, gods, and monuments just boggles the mind and bogs down gameplay.  I just don't feel inclined to spend the time to learn the nuiances of the game, when there are so many other games out there with simpler systems that are just as deep and satisfying to play (if not more so!)  I'm more than willing to give it a couple more plays to see if my opinion might change, but for now I'm somewhat ho-hum.

Played once (6 player, with expansion). Probably an unusual game, with all 6 of us playing for the first time, and only one person having read the rules.

Quite a good game.  If it has a major flaw it is that it's too similar to so many other games.  "It's really cool.  See, it's sort of like Civilization, only not as long.  And you get wooden meeples for playing pieces.  And you can trade resources with other players.  Oh, and you use dice for combat."
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.25
Interesting "lite-Civ" type game, but it suffers some problems. It seems Egypt and Babylon are stronger starting than the other Civs and unless other players keep them in check they can easily run away with the game. Unequal play experience can drastically hurt your chances of winning -- if you know the best wonders and heroes to go it gives you a huge advantage over just picking what you think it best now.

My score might rise if I played it again and everyone kept everyone else in check -- but it seemed I was the only one actively attacking people and everyone else was just defending and building towards victory ASAP with no regard for stopping others. (2009-12-11)

2nd Game. Played as Hannibal in a 6 player game with expansion. Same problems with Egypt and Babylon being extremely strong and players not shutting them down. I got attacked from both Egypt and Atlantis because Babylon put no pressure on Egypt. Rome won because Atlas attacked me and Greece did suicide attacks against Babylon instead of putting pressure on Rome. Definitely needs experienced players who know who to fight to maintain the "checks and balances" in a sense.

It's a trading game, a civ building game, and a multiplayer war-game, all at the same time! Mare Nostrum is strongly driven by player interactions, and each game can play out totally differently based on your opponents' level of aggression and trading strategy. It's a highwire balancing act though, as it's easy to get blindsided if you focus too much on one front. On one hand, make sure you don't get invaded, but watch out too that someone doesn't build the pyramids from a strong trade engine. Accusations of imbalance are grossly overblown, the greater issue is that it's too easy for one player to get ganged up on and devastated beyond recovery. 

Note: The Mythology expansion is required to get the most out of your game.

Fun game, a bit shoehorned in strategy by your race and not enough impact to affect someone on the other side of the map: if you don't meet, the interaction with such a player is virtually non-existent. Gods/wonder draw is highly random, get the right one(s) at the right time and you're set.

That being said, we had a good time, it is both grand in scale as easy to learn and playable in one evening, and experience will lessen all the aforementioned drawbacks. Would not mind playing again!

Mare Nostrum is a fun, anachronistic empire building game.  Unlike Antike, it has specific player powers that I find appealing.

I was pleasantly surprised with this game, especially after reading how a lot of people were so disappointed with it.  Perhaps never having played Civilization helped me in this regard.  Mare Nostrum has a nice, quick buildup phase when resources start to run out, namely Caravans and Cities.  Then, it's more about military might. diplomacy, and alliances.  The whole time, you are trying to complete sets of resources while simultaneously denying them to opponents.  Each power can have a distinct and flavorful advantage given by its hometown hero.  Excellent game.

Very strong game. The strategy you use will be dependent on which race you start as. Depending on who you are, you may wish to opt for a strong military, or perhaps rule the water with triremes..

Great game, absolutely a classic.

Pretty decent game. Took one play through to get all of the rules down though. The first game played ended up with a winner that came out of nowhere, which was interesting. Many (not all though) plays since then have resulted in one player getting far ahead of everyone else, with the rest of the players attempting to drag the leader down. Okay for a play or two, but this gets annoying after repeated plays.

As a fan of Civilization, I had to give a chance to Mare Nostrum. And I'm glad I did! Mare Nostrum is actually a simplified and shortened version of Civilization (its glorious ancestor). A thing I like is that it perfectly mixes warfare, trade, expansion and technology. I never saw these themes so well mixed before.
The only dark side I found is the lack of flexibility that each nation has. They all tend to adopt a given strategy (Roman attacking the Greek, Egypt getting cities as fast as possible, etc.).
With the Release of an extension that will introduce gods and mythology in the game, Mare Nostrum could become the ultimate strategy game in an Antiquity setting next to Civilization!

RATING: 3
One game.  Lasted three turns.  No combat.  Very little going on.  Seriously underwhelmed.  The trading seemed to be 90% of the game.  This is fine and good, if I was signing up to play a trading game, but this advertises itself as a civ game.  Just seemed completely off.  Maybe I'm missing a rule somewhere.  Maybe I'm missing the point.  I just know either I am missing something in the game, or the game is missing something.    I'm told the game shines with more experience.... I don't really think I want that experience.  The trading mechanism would be neat for a 30 minute filler.... I don't feel like doing it much more than that.  UPDATE:  Tried a second time.  Only the word kingmaking can describe it.

RATING: 7
After only 1 play I feel inclined to rate this at what I feel is a bit low.  This game is fantastic! 

EDIT: After many plays I think 7 is the home this deserves.  I have only played the game with the expansion so I'm rating them the same.  A great civ building game that has great replay value but tends to get tedious with the constant get cards/give cards.

UPDATE: I just took this one off the shelf after having not played it a couple years and am excited about it again. Funny how that can happen. I can't wait to give this a try again!

I've come to the conclusion that I don't like this game  - someone in my game group spends half the game using table talk to get players to attack each other because that's the kind of interaction he wants.  If he thinks you're in the lead, he's going to start directing other players to attack you if he can't do it himself - dragging out a game that no one particularly wanted to play in the first place.

An amazing game of civilization. Fast, simple and unique mechanics makes this game a masterpiece. The original game without the expansion gets a 9, but with the expansion gets a solid 10.

We really wanted to like this, and it has some interesting parts, but... the opening was very dull (advanced setup might help a bit, but there is still a desperate shortage of city markers), the endgame was problematic, and the trading was mostly worthless (if the Director of Commerce doesn't need to trade, trading won't happen or will be minimal, and this was usually the case).  I'm down to hoping there are problems with the English rules at this point - certainly they're very unclear on a number of points.

Great looking game with easy to explain rules and epic scope. So, what's not to like? Well, I played this beauty three times with 4 and 5 players, and none of these times we were able to finish it after 3 - 4 hours of play. Somehow, it is prone to end with one player not being able to get the last victory point and all other players not being able to progress because they give everything up to keep it that way. For a similar feel, you are better off playing Antike.
UPDATE: It appears that the German rulebook is incomplete, and this probably explains the long playing time. Really want to play the English version now!
UPDATE: I was finally able to play the English version together with the Mythology expansion. My rating for the base game with corrected powers and the complete set of victory conditions is a 7. With expansion, it becomes a 7.5. The game really falls into the same category as Chaos In The Old World and Cyclades, in that it is heavily dependent on players keeping each other in check.

Wow, our 6 player game took 6+ hours to play... but yes, we finished it! :)

I really like some of the ideas here. Graphics are cool too. BUT. I believe there are many problems with this game (we played with the Mythology Expansion). For us, the game was endless back-and-forth excercise. No one wanted to trade anything and game just stalled for 4 hours. I guess with certain playing style, the game would work better. BUT I believe it is the game to blame, if it cannot naturally push players to the right direction. Some elegant systems, but I believe that the soul of the game (cards, trading and winning conditions), while nice, doesn't really work or is too fragile. Dissapointing.

Best of the numerous contenders for [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/71]Civ[/url]-lite crown.  Scarce resources force war in a manner very true-to-life.  Dynamic of slowly building civilization is a viable strategy, while instant-win condition (Pyramids) makes sure that any player always has a chance of getting what they need through military means.  The accusations of imbalance puzzle me.  My group has tens of plays under our collective belts, and we see no significant advantage or disadvantage.  The most common gripe seems to be that Rome can plow over Greece with no difficulty, but that seems to be a quick way to put both Rome and Greece behind.  In my games, the game is often over by the time Rome can build up enough of a force to do lasting harm to Greece.

There's a lot to like here; it's a very involved and deep game that, true to its intention, gives a full game experience in a long-but-not-too-long timeframe. What I don't like about it is that it's one of only a few strategic games I've played where a player, through no fault of their own, can be completely prevented from doing anything beneficial for the remainder of the game, and also cannot be eliminated. This is, in my opinion, just about the worst thing that can happen to a player, and I don't enjoy sessions in which that happens to any one of the players. I played with the expansion, and it did not fix this problem.

So torn on this...some aspects I love, but it has big issues. I think I'd love the trading system if it were embedded in some other context.  But the biggest issue for me, by far, is simple: the game state is a mess.  Your production (in/out) is public knowledge (a few cards around the edges can be hidden away), so to play well, you have to grind away figuring out every player's "missing" pieces; this isn't interesting work, it's just grueling and could easily be summarized in one central chart (esp. considering the attractive but indistinct graphics, and the bizarre choice of markers that obscure them). And speaking of work, the constant cards in/out is just...dull and repetitive (again, a chart or grid?).  This is all independent of the near-certainty I have that a well-played game of this should technically never end.  But with such a muddy game state, mistakes are easy to make.

Shame, as the civ distinctions and the card combos are fun, and the fighting is fun. Having to do work just to understand the game state is just...asinine.

Interesting game.  The trading mechanic is clever, but im not convinced that it adds much except lots of fiddliness.  You can embargo people if folks cooperate.  I could see having lots of AP during this phase while you count up what someone has in their hand and figure out what to keep from them.  Strategy feels a bit scripted, and if folks dont actively hose certain players the game becomes unbalanced.  Play with the maximum amount of people, it felt strange having an neutral country because the people bordering it have an easier game.  

I think there are flaws here.  It was also a lot of fun to play, so if you like the the theme, go for it.  Note: These comments are about Mare Nostrum + the Expansion.

Civilization - in an evening.  The mechanics are streamlined,  with a little bit of economics,  a little bit of building, a little bit of combat.  Everything is nicely abstracted - the "goods" produced by your empire are only important in that you need sets of differing goods to buy things.  The alternative is to collect sets of money.   Either way,  the cost of things is either 3 (for generic soldiers,  influence for taking over territories),  6 (to upgrade the production of a region),  9 (to build a wonder) or 12 (to win the game!).

The resources are sufficiently scarce to encourage "player interaction" (ie attacking your neighbour).  Combat is random - attacker and defender role a die for each troop,  every 5 points kills an opposing troop.  Player elimination is possible, but rarely cost effective.

The game is won by building 3(?) wonders or building the 12-cost pyramids.  There's a bit of memory finagling during the trading,  as you try to make sets of 9 goods (to buy wonders)  while trying not to give someone enough to make sets of 9 goods (or a game-winning set of 12!).  Interesting trade mechanic - Trader names the number of goods to trade.   Each player (with sufficient goods)  places reveals that number of goods.  Trader takes a good from another player,  then that player may draw from another player and so on.  You can't go back and forth more than 3 times,  ostensibly to prevent player exclusion,  although with 3 players colluding you can manage to exclude the leader.

Wonders are special powers!  So as you progress towards the game-winning condition,  you are given some pretty substantial powers,  and since all the wonders are different,  empires tend to differ a bit from game-to-game (although people will have their favorite combo...)

Balance is iffy - the empires are probably not balanced (Greece seems to be weak out of the box) and the wonders aren't balanced either.  The game plays out as a "bash-the-leader" or "bash-your-neighbour" style,  which encourages players balancing the game - it's in everyone's interest to reign in the leaders.  This does mean that in the endgame (unless you managed to catch people off-guard earlier on),  almost everyone is in contention for the win,  some closer than others.  It often degenerates into not paying attention during a trade phase,  or a nice bit of maneuvering during combat.

Not perfect - the game length is pretty variable,  since losing is often a matter of someone making a mistake,  which can occur early or late.  Also, the game depends a lot on the players to keep things in balance - if you don't reign in the leader,  they'll take the win in short order.

One of my first Euros,  and lots of good memories here.  The expansion adds a lot of more powers,  and more ways to win,  which probably shortens the max game length.  The game is definitely best played with a full board of players though.

This was not what I was expecting at all. In our game of Mare Nostrum I was the Atlanteans and was very isolated from the rest of the cultures. The gist of the game is winning by building the pyramids or by building four heroes/wonders. You’ll also be building caravans, markets, temples, cities, legionaries, triremes, and mythical creatures. And you build all of these things by turning in sets of goods. Each set of good must consist of unique goods, so if you needed to turn in a set of six goods, you must have six different goods. The complication is that you don’t have access to all of the goods, so at the beginning of the round there’s a trade phase where you must trade a certain number of goods (as determined by the Director of Commerce). After that you’ll optionally make offerings to the gods in an order dictated by the High Priest, then build buildings in the order the Political Leader says, then finally move units in the order the Military Leader decrees.

I was doing pretty well as the Atlanteans, and would have won the next round, but my neighbor managed to pull out the Pyramids win on our final round. I was very surprised at how little combat there was in our particular game as the rules talked quite a bit about how combat was resolved. Still, I really enjoyed my one play of the game and look forward to trying it out again.

Tentatively recommended. Try before you buy.

This game is beautiful, well-designed, deep without being too complex, and easily played on any given evening. All selling points. I LOVE the fact that your overall strategy varies according to who you are - games like that are the jam (from Cosmic Encounter to TI:3 to Dune). The only complaint I have is that, until everyone I know who plays this game figures out the nuances of being the Director of Commerce, our games will invariably get shut down by somebody who calls too many trades and gives some random person the game. Keep it tight and be patient!

RATING: 4
I like civ games best when they don't have resources and aren't won by the first player to build a predetermined number of wonders, monuments, or heroes.  They're called wargames, and they're much more fun.

Putting aside my inherent bias, I can see where Mare Nostrum could get some people singing its praises, despite its well-documented flaws.  If you want a short experience in ancient racial evolution, look no further - as long as you don't mind unbalanced starting positions, a fragile (and sometimes broken) trade system, etc.

Bonus session report:

I built just enough military/mythological might in my first game to prevent another player from winning, but in so doing I shut down my own chance at victory.  I can't get behind a civ game where a combat-free strategy is the only winning option.  Bah humbug.

Very fun first game (using the expansion).  Rating is for the game with the expansion (the only way I've played it).  I like the trading vs. combat vs. economic balance and the way the players have to be keeping their neighbors in check while building their own systems.

(3/20/2012)  Bumped the rating down to 7 because whenever it comes up, I want to play something else instead.  Tough to get played because of the number of players it needs and the necessity of everyone understanding how to keep each other in check (the same thing I liked about it initially).

Honestly my brothers didn't like the wooden pieces so we almost didn't buy this one.  The historical theme and Civ look led me to believe good things might be inside the box.  My opinion prevailed and we were all glad it did.  I have only ever played this as a 3 way and due to that each time there has been a bit of kingmaking but I still love it.  The combination of war and trade is done in such a way to enable plenty of options yet still remain simple enough to play in a decent time.  Still wish it had sexier bits... just call me superficial but it does make games easier to 'sell' to the beer & pretzels crowd.

And did you wonder what a boardgame would be like if it were crafted with this concept in mind?
I did. Mare Nostrum is THAT game.

Forget Risk:Godstorm and the like, MN is the daddy of the card-playing, dice-clattering, alliance-shattering, warmongering, goods trading, empire-building genre. It bestrides other games, as Telos bestrode Jason's Argo. Heroes, and monsters from the deep, really will rise, and nations and cities really will fall.

The board is beautiful, though pale, allowing the rainbow-coloured game pieces to stand out on the table. The cards are all excellently illustrated, and the components workmanlike; the rulebook clear and useful. 

Game mechanics-wise, this is the gorgeous daughter of Risk and Blood Royale, with which she has many similarities. The combat resolution is masterfully simple and fair, and superior to Risk because of it. The forces at your disposal, legions, triremes, and mythological monsters, are expensive to construct, making invasion a costly business, and one in which a player must debate, weighing consequences, before committing to her actions. The resource card system is very much like the aforementioned Blood Royale, underpinning an elegant trade design that keeps resource-heavy players in check. MN is even related to Knizia's Marco Polo Expedition, with its own card set collecting resource system. Diplomacy between players can last as long as they want wish it (unlike the painful treaties of BR), and construction of advantageous sites, etc, is limited only by the tax collected in your coffers, or the trade goods you have at hand.

Inherent in a design built around resource-management, MN forces the player to make agonising decisions each and every turn: What godly favours should you buy? What buildings/armies should I raise? What wonders should I build? You will find yourself - in a good way - scratching your head, mind spinning, while trying to best advance your civilisation. Because of all this, the game has multiple paths to victory, none of which are assured success. If you want to expand murderously, or simply build great cities filled with marketplaces to trade to victory, the game allows you to do these things, encouraging/enabling organic - not programmed - gameplay; your opponents may have other designs and plans, however...

Each nation has its own strengths and weaknesses to exploit, as well as geographical defence issues to address. The player whom best manages his abilities will be in good standing for a win, just like in most games. Roles, like Political Leader, or Military Leader, are won and lost during the game and these are vital to control the game's development, allowing the title bearer to decide turn order; a power which should not be underestimated.

Mare Nostrum is fairly swift to play, considering the subject matter, and combines the very best in euro-game mechanics with Risk-like conquest elements. This makes for a very, very satisfying game, and one which I've been searching for since my dad introduced his young son to Risk. The ULTIMATE ancient empire conquest game.

[B]THE TITAN RISING FROM THE DEEP, SEAWATER CASCADING DOWN FROM ITS HORNED HEAD, TRIPLE EYES BLAZING WITH FURY:[/B]

1. Large, nice sized board.
2. Great theme.
3. Empire-building gameplay.
4. Design has lofty ambitions, which are solidly met by the game systems that drive it.
5. Vast in scope - each turn probably simulates 20 years or some-such.
6. You can wield Krakens and Centaurs, as generals leading your traditional grizzled, sword-and-Hoplon armies.
7. You can unleash the power of the gods. In this game you can destroy a city, if you wish, with the fist of an angry god. That's a pretty cool thing.
8. Minimalist approach to all buttresses of the game's architecture.
9. Game demonstrates that you can have simple rules (2-3 pages) and still achieve deep immersive game-play.
10. Many paths to victory.
11. Not a steep learning cure to the game's various strategies.
12. Tactical as well as strategic, on many levels.
13. Very elegant trade system, possibly the best.
14. Has more wood in the box than a hottub filled with pornstars.
15. It's easy, at a glance, to appraise the victory status of each player and the balance of power in the Med, because the tokenry (is that even a word?) is straight to the point simple, and also the muted colours on the board contrast nicely with the bright wooden meeples - so you're not squinting at a hundred pieces of detailed cardboard on a garish game-board, puzzling over who's won yet.
16. You get to utilise Medusa and a whole usual suspects line-up of mythical heroes. That's pretty cool right there.
17. It's a trident's length better than Cyclades - which I enjoy.
18. During the course of play you may engage in costly, time consuming wars, but they just don't feel as spiteful as the knife fights in Cyclades.
19. The basic structure of the game enables and encourages emergent game-play. You can break or bind contracts verbally with other players as you see fit.
20. Interesting decisions on every turn. A satisfying game.


[b]THE FAUN, PIPING EXUBERANTLY, CROUCHING BEHIND A GNARLED TREE:[/b]

1. Needs at least 4 players. Don't even bother getting the box out of the Hepplewhite for 2 friends and yourself. Just don't.
2. It's expensive and hard-to-find.
3. You MUST play using the Mythology expansion. If you have the means, I highly recommend it.
4. It's a heavily disguised Euro: trading, area control, optimising, roles, and special turn order malarkey.
5. Takes 2-3 hours to finish, number and pedigree of players withstanding.
6. It's a diet-Civ. And, yes, that's a pejorative term hereabouts.
7. A lot of guys whose opinions I respect say that the game has region-balance issues, not entirely addressed by the Mythology box. I have not found this to be a deal-breaker however.
8. Could be prone to king-making, like any "make yourself a king" game, I suppose. And if this game has that problem, then so does Cyclades - so there!
9. You need to either have all players know the game's heroes from A to Z backwards, forwards, and sideways; OR come up with a House Rule that covers what heroes players can pick. I just don't think it's a good idea for folks to be able to hire a hero with their hard-earned trade cards, and then spend until their next turn deciding which super-hero to have - because there's like a hundred to choose from. If someone's new to Mare Nostrum, they will be bewildered. Put out 3 at a time, or something.
10. Has a strange name that not all players will recall 3 months after playing. What is it about these type of games? People are still arguing over how to say "Cyclades" even now. This game is pronounced, "Maaray Nostrum," meaning "Our Sea." Or so my most enlightened friend informed me... If it isn't, then go mud wrestle a Cyclops.
11. The trade cards can take up a bit of table space, and somebody really needs to be the banker.
12. The ONLY thing I would have done if this was my game, admitting that I couldn't have come up with this as it stands anyhow, would be that each player was actually playing a god, fighting to raise the greatest empire of men - instead of you each being the pious king that you are at present. Maybe that's because I'm a Londoner (I'm not), or maybe it's because I want to have the power of a god, not "buy" a god's power each turn with offerings. I feel the same way about Cyclades, come to think about it.

I own the MYTHOLOGY expansion.

RATING: 5
Good production with lots of promising concepts, but the game plays terribly.  By turn two one of the players was already 1 card away from achieving the victory condition, and I myself won it four turns after that.  Everyone was questioning if we had gotten the rules wrong to have finished so fast.  To me, a civilization-building game should be epic in its attempt to mimic a culture's rise and fall, but Mare Nostrum felt deceptively mundane with some really poorly implemented designs that seem rather useless.

I played this game twice, then traded it away.  I have no desire to play again.  I don't hate the game, it's just that I'd rather spend 3+ hours of my time playing something else besides "bash the leader".

An under-appreciated classic. The simple mechanics border on the genious. Easy to learn, but difficult to win. Patience is rewarded; laziness, bad diplomacy and stubborness is quickly punished. Timidness will quickly give victory to someone else, but aggressiveness will never win the game. Trading is crucial, yet dangerous and treacherous. The pace is relaxed, but losing concentration will quickly hit you in the face. Every victory is hard work and feels much more rewarding than in most games combined.

After 1 Play: I don't know why, but this game just didn't click for me.  Also, it seemed like some players had a big starting advantage over the others.

I really like this, although not all of my group agrees. The combat system is great and the varying powers of the heroes and monuments add much to the flavor. The game could last quite a while, but that is not a problem for me. The board looks nice and the components are also nice, so nothing bad to say, really.

An epic-feel game with streamlined rules and little need to keep referencing the rules (as you would with, for example, a Fantasy Flight game). The artwork is excellent as are the mechanics. The game has one expansion which, while difficult to find, is very well done and does make the game stronger and allows for more variability.

Own the Mythology expansion.

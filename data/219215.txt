ONUW it's not. It removes most of the potential for clever play and replaces it with 20 questions. This might make it better for some shyer groups, but it makes for a duller game. Still some decent fun as a filler, but ONUW is still king.

RATING: 9
Calling this "20 Questions made into a game" is meant to be disparaging, but here's the thing: the "game" elements added to that old classic makes all the difference. Anybody who enjoys Codenames or One Night Ultimate Werewolf will like this, but it feels like a fresh take and not just a tired rehash of the aforementioned.

The app works well (although I couldn't get it to play sound on an ipad with an older version of ios). My only complaint is that the word lists are *very* American-centric especially at higher difficulties. If you're a non-USA group, the first thing you should do on the app is increase the number of words the Mayor can choose from so you can ignore the words (American sports teams, cities, idioms, minor celebrities) that won't mean anything to you.

After many plays, rating raised to "9". Even more accessible than the brilliant "One Night Ultimate" games.

Rarely would I prefer to play two games of this versus one of one night ultimate werewolf and one of contact. 
But for certain groups this could hit the right spot on the game weight and level of meta.
Well executed and again integrated with an app.
The turnaround vote forces thematic play on the wolfs and seers.

RATING: 5
Players essentially play a game of 20 Questions (but the questioned here are unlimited, rather than 20) to figure out a secret word. The Seer knows the word, and tries to steer the group to the word without being detected by the Werewolf, and the Werewolf knows the word is trying to steer the group away from the word without being detected.

This is pretty much a clone of Insider, very slightly modified to include some Werewolf-y roles, so I give it the same rating I gave Insider. It's OK, but I find the guessing of who is the Werewolf or Seer to be pretty much a crap shoot, which isn't really that fun to me, despite the 20 Questions portion of the game being fairly fun. I'd prefer just playing 20 Questions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Werewolf meets 20 questions. Players try to guess a word selected by the "mayor" by asking yes or no questions within a 4-minute time limit. Nice, quick deduction game that adds a nice twist with the introduction of the werewolf, seer, and other special roles. Definitely the type of games where you will play a few rounds at a time, and a good way to start a game night!

Combines two games (One Night & Insider) of which I am not particularly fond.  I don't mind a 20-questions style game, but added wrinkle of not trying to expose your role continues to frustrate me.  Not sure if I dislike this more than One Night.

I am not going to say this is a "Bad Game", because I don't think it is a bad game for what it is.  However, for ME, I do not like it at all, and I do not want to ever play it again.  It combines elements of all of the types of games that I hate - group think, social deduction, 20-questions, hidden roles, and "guessing" the bad guy.

If you like Werewolf and it's various iterations, if you like "guessing" games, and if you like games like "20-questions", then by all means play this game, as I am sure you will have fun.  But for me, I will politely say "no" and walk away.

RATING: 7
Components: Clearly marked role cards. The tokens are almost unnecessary. The app is easy to use, even for first time players.

Experience: Lots of fun. 20 questions is hard enough, but by throwing in the time pressure and the hidden roles, the game really shines. Perhaps my only complaint is that the games are samey, because we get into a rhythm of pursuing a similar line of questioning each time. Doesn't work as well with 4 player where sometimes only one person doesn't know the word.

Werewords is a hidden role game of "20 questions." Carrying mechanics from Ultimate Werewolf, Werewords has two roles that know the word--one wants it to be guessed and one does not. Both want their role to be unknown. Werewords is a great gateway to hidden role games and is always enjoyable to play. Rounds are short and satisfying.

First off, will say I don't like Werewolf games. HOWEVER if I were to play any games of the Werewolf variety, I would definitely gravitate towards this version.

Interesting twist on the ho-hum Werewolf affair. The Mayor is trying to get the players to guess a word. Some of the players have a secret role: Werewolf or Seer. They all know what the word is. The game is timed; you can ask the Mayor any question but the Mayor can only respond with literally "Yes", "No", or "maybe" (by using tokens with the corresponding word).

If the word is guessed correctly, the werewolves have a chance of winning by voting who they think is the Seer. If they are right, they win. As a result, it is in the Seer's interest to NOT declare the word and guide the players as best as they can without being obvious.

If the word is NOT guessed in the time frame, the players can vote who they think is a Werewolf. If they are right, they win the game. As a result, it is in the Werewolves' interest to not completely obstruct the game/be obvious.

So it's interesting and neat.
Does require an app to run and a space of reasonable quiet (so you can hear the app's prompts and so the mayor can hear the questions).

My son loves the shit out of this game.  I enjoy it, especially in comparison to "One Night Werewolf".

For me, the amount of information available in the "One Night..." games is always just a little too light.  They often just become "he said she said", which I know is the point.

Werewords adds a simple enough game on top (20 questions), reduces the number of special roles, and keeps the game theory super tight.  All big wins for me.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (September 2017)

I have played before the game One Night Ultimate Werewolf, and although fun (with the right crowd), I didn’t want to play it again. Its decisions are obvious and easy, most things are out of players control and due to this, it almost isn’t a game. I think both of its sequels are the same (Daybreak and One Night Ultimate Vampire) so I didn’t buy nor played them. I was expecting similar things from Werewords, but a friend convinced me that it was a different game and he was right! Werewords is a good party game and a must have for me.

The rules of the game are very simple. You can explain them under 5 minutes. Playtime is around 5-6 minutes.

The game´s components are ok and functional, but the role tiles get marked very easily, so I sleeved them. The art is ok as well.

Werewords is a mix of Werewolf (ok game) with The Resistance: Avalon (I love it)  and Black Stories (I like it). It works great! In each game, there is a secret word that the good characters need to guess to win and the bad characters, who already know the word, need to confuse the other players so they don’t guess the word. If the word is correctly guessed the good guys win but the werewolves and their minions can still win by killing the Seer (exactly like Merlin from Avalon). If the word isn’t guessed, the good guys can still win by killing a werewolf. The process of guessing the word works exactly like Black Stories. Players can ask the Mayor (who cannot speak and already knows the secret word) questions that can be answered with a “Yes” or “No” answer and they have 4 minutes to correctly guess the word.

Werewords uses an app as other previous games in the series, but in this case the app is a must have, that is, without the app, the game cannot be played. I have played many times now and the app works great, however, there is a bug when you play with 11 players. In that configuration the app resets. We tried with many different iPhones and the bug persisted. I hope they fix it soon. Still, I don’t plan to play much with 11 players. The game is best played with 6 players. The app offers a wide array of words, so far, we have only played with the easy category.

Bottom line, Werewords is a fun and quick game. I already bought it and I will be playing it a lot in the future. It is MUCH better than any other game in the series.

2017-07-14 - This is a pretty fun twist on 20 questions. I like the app, although it makes a lot of the physical components, aside from the role cards, seem superfluous. There's a learning curve with the questioning and honing in on the word, and while you're learning it, the game might seem skewed toward the wolves. I suspect that the pendulum will swing the other way, though, as you get better at questioning.

Excellent take on roles mixed with 20 questions.  If you have ever played 20 questions think of that meets hidden roles and extra end game conditions.  I can not recommend this game enough.

Been playing games for years including werewolf but something about this little party games hits home perfectly.

I've become a big fan of Ted Alspach's games and this is another great game on the shelf. Call me old school, though, it's weird to be so reliant on an app... but it works. And it works well. My gaming group gets a huge kick out of being the Werewolf or Seer and trying to hide within the crowd. It's deceptively simple and strategy evolves every time you play it. 

Probably my only gripe is that the art is very "meh." I'm not one to usually complain about art style either. But it's not a big deal. You generally won't be focused on the art, but the person's whom you're playing with.

The game fuses the game werewolf with 20 questions.  I like the little app that tells the mayor and werewolf what the words are along with the seer.  Villiagers then start asking questions.  The mayor can answer using tokens with yes, and no..    if the mayor runs out tokens the villiagers lose.  If the villiagers don’t solve the item they lose.  The werewolf can win if he finds the seer before the time ends.  The werewolf wins if villiagers lose.

The game was ok. I would play it again but would not seek it out.

Nice mix of hidden role with 20-questions style play.  Great, simple setup with clear defined roles and  player motivation for those rules.  Occasionally gets dicey with trying to ascertain if a question warrants a yes/no/maybe answer when you're mayor.  Tight game mechanics makes this a must have for those who love word games and hidden roles games.

This game works surprisingly well for what I initially thought would just be an odd combo.  It plays very similar to Insider which I like.  I like the game itself better, but the choices of words are too pop culture for me to enjoy it as much as I'd like.  I find those make it difficult for some in groups depending on their exposure to whichever films or media are covered.

This is a solid 9 for me, though it kicks into a 10 because it plays in about 5 minutes.

Gamer's 20 Questions, which sounds like an insult, but it's not.  Trust me, it's not.

Spectacular game.  I know Insider did it first, but this improves on the design considerably.  Every gamer should own a copy and I'd suggest this to non-gamers over Codenames.

I don't think it plays terribly well with 4.  It's likely that half the people at the table know the secret word.  5 is better. but isn't ideal.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Played 12-15 rounds with a group of 8...

Somehow, the game never fully engaged me.  

Our group did struggle to identify the word - I think we only did it twice - and this really prevented suspense from developing in later rounds.  People were getting disillusioned... The "Easy" word choices from the App did not seem that easy to us.

In addition, the questions started to follow the same pattern every round  - it just got samey and boring.

Perhaps 20 questions is just not that compelling of a game foundation after all...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Amazing party game... it improves on Insider by limiting the number of questions you can make and using the tokens to respond diminishes the "cheating" factor of verbal signs when giving the answers.

I hate social deduction games, and will generally pass on games like Werewolf, Resistance, etc. However, the 20 questions element in Werewords provides enough of a distraction for me that I can tolerate it, and on occasion even have some fun playing it. I still dread getting any other role than Villager, but even when I do, the word game gives me something to focus on, as opposed to say ONUW where you're given a blank canvas and you have to come up with a believable story on the spot.

RATING: 5.5
I was quite disappointed with this one. I had high hopes hearing about the game from friends. But unfortunately the game doesn't work well with people who are not native English speakers. Not necessarily because of inability to speak the language but rather because words that are considered 'easy' are those that are barely used in normal day to day conversations. Not only many people have then to look up the word, it is especially difficult for the 'seer' particularly to play an active role. Sadly, it doesn't seem like this game would ever see another play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Fun game in the spirit of insider with an added twist of Werewolf.  Which one I will choose to play will depend on the group.  Insider feels more entry level while Werewords feels like more of a gamer's edition.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.83
I guess after 61 plays I'll write a comment. Unlike One Night, I don't think I'll ever get tired of this game.

This game takes what Insider did and improves upon it in really important ways. First of all, in Insider, there is little incentive for non-insiders to help very much with finding the clue word. Yes, you all lose if you don't guess it, but so does the Insider. The pressure in on the Insider or having hard words that every player happens to want to try hard to get. With Werewords, the villagers all want to find the word and the Werewolves don't. The Seer and Werewolves know what the word is, but neither can be too obvious; if the village guesses the word, then the Werewolves try to guess who the Seer is, but if the if the word isn't guessed, then the villagers get to guess who the Werewolves are. That's a brilliant change that solves the problem of Insider feeling broken.

Not only that, Insider comes with a deck of cards that is far surpassed by Werewords' database. I haven't seen any repeated words in the app yet, so that's really impressive. 

I've played with all player counts now, and I must say it works great even with 4 players. The clue giver can also be a Werewolf or Seer. This is now my 2nd favorite Social Deduction game to Moriarty's Machinations, which is an evolution of Resistance. Werewords is also super cheap; everyone should own it.

Reminds me a lot of [thing=206051][/thing] but the execution of the game play is way better. Use of an application makes the game run smoothly and just works so well. Really great party game and I had a ton of fun with this. Werewolf theme works well in this situation too. Great design and game play. Would be a great night cap game for sure.

This game took game night by storm. We were fans of the Werewolf franchise and we love word games, so boom, instant purchase.
The game is great. It employs the hidden identity aspect, from Werewolf, that we love and combines the "educational" game, that sometimes gets us into fights, but mostly is just awesome moments of "aha!"

First time I sat down to play and heard the premise explained I thought "this is stupid". We proceeded to play 12 straight times.

Best version of Werewolf I've played but the artwork *sucks*, what were they thinking? Begs for print-n-play.

A fun game, even for younger kids. The more people the better. The first few games I played was with my boys (7,9,13) and it took a few rounds before the boys understood how to play, the roles, and the nuances of how to be a 'subtle' werewolf or seer. Then on Christmas Eve, we had 7 people, mostly kids, where we got to introduce a second werewolf. Those rounds were MUCH more fun!

A quick and especially silly variant of 20 questions.
Good for a laugh, but not something I'd pay for.
Honestly,  you don't even really need any components to play.   Just download the app and use any old Resistance/Werewolf/similar cards.   
You'll be better off too, as the art and production value of the retail version is miserable.

I really liked this take on a word game with added in Werewolf components. At it's heart it is like 20 Questions where everyone asks a player yes or no questions to try to guess their word. The catch is that there are two others in the group that know the word too. One is a werewolf among them trying to throw people off and the other a seer trying to guild them to the word. Neither of them can be too obvious, because if they succeed but are named as the seer/werewolf, then they lose anyways. The mayor who in the person answering the questions can also have the role as a werewolf or seer as well which can be quite interesting. My only real issue with this game is that, no matter what team is successful during the main game play, the losing team still gets that guess. It could be a complete guess and still win, which sucks. At the lower player counts, the odds aren't that bad. However, it plays fun and quick enough that its not really a huge issue. I think this more approachable and is a great introduction to the regular One Night Werewolf game.

一个结合了狼人与谁是卧底的游戏。市长得知了对付狼人的神秘咒语，奈何却被禁言。
游戏的目的是要猜出这个咒语（词语），以及清除狼人。游戏中，村长、先知、狼人都知道咒语，村民不知。在游戏中所有人可以问市长问题，村长只能回答“是，或者不是”，如果在限定时间内猜出咒语，则狼人暴露。狼人有一次机会杀死先知，如果成功则狼人获胜。如果在限定时间内没有猜出咒语，玩家则有一次机会投死狼人。
游戏的核心在于，如果你知道答案，你不能很明显的给出，只能慢慢引导，同时在过程中猜测谁也知道答案。如果你不知道答案，则要尽可能的去获得信息，同时在过程中看谁在磨洋工。可以说是一个双线发展的猜身份游戏，很符合中国国情。
但不管怎样，这两个机制合并，总感觉有点违和….

I'm not a fan of pure hidden role games like Werewolf (including the one night version) or The Resistance.  I think there is no real gameplay in these purely social games and unless someone is a terrible liar they just boil down to blind random guesses.  But I like a lot of hidden role games with a little bit more gameplay, such as Spyfall or Blood Bound.

This is another one I'm fond of.  Instead of simply finding the members of the other team the villagers are trying to guess a word with 20 Questions-style yes/no questions.  The villagers have a Seer on their team that knows the word and the Werewolves know the word as well so the Seer should be trying to steer the questions to guess the word and the Werewolves would be trying to steer the questions away.  This is important because if the word is guessed the Werewolves still win by guessing who the Seer is.  If the word isn't guessed the villagers still win by guessing the Werewolves.

The other fun caveat to this is the Mayor, who runs the game, can also be the Werewolf and outright lie with the clues he gives.  But of course it might be really obvious if he tells clear lies that he's the Werewolf.  Overall a really fun game with some interesting layers on the standard hidden role experience.

Probably my 3rd favorite party game after Codenames and Deception at the moment. The fact that you're struggling over words adds a dimension of decision-making that you don't get with most other traitor games. Also, I was wary of the fact that the mayor/moderator can be a werewolf but it turns out that it adds to the fun of the game.

RATING: 4
It's essentially 20 Questions with some hidden roles thrown in. The incentives are a bit broken, though. If you lose the main game, you get to guess who you think the wolf/seer was, and if you get it right, you win. That means that, if you're pretty sure you know who the wolf/seer is, you want to lose the guessing part of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
More fun than 20 questions has any right to be.  Especially given that the mashup with One Night Werewolf doesn't actually work that well.  Somehow, that final product just ends up being enough fun that it doesn't matter.

[[Bézier Games 17 edition] {Werewolf; social deduction, word; scalable} A refreshing attempt to One Night Ultimate Werewolf.  Now people has to guess a word properly with sabotage from werewolves.

It receives many positive feedback.  Looking forward to play it.

Hope the App can have Chinese words so that my daughters and her friends can play more accessibly.

Werewords is basically 20 questions with some social deduction.  One player knows the answer (a.k.a. Merlin) and one player is trying to figure out who knows the answer (a.k.a. Werewolf).  

This is a very strange mix of genres.  For one thing, the players are limited by time, not by the number of questions.  So the werewolf player can only really sabotage things by  wasting time or.  Secondly, the cluegiver can be the werewolf.  Their only options are to intentionally answer questions the wrong way, but the Merlin player should be able to tell if they are lying very easily.  We didn't see this play out, but I can't really imagine how it would work.  Lastly, you don't even have to get the question right.  If you don't, you just have to guess who the werewolf was.  And in our 7 player games, we had 2 werewolves.  So if you can determine the Merlin player and determine that the cluegiver wasn't the werewolf, that leaves a 40% of guessing a werewolf by chance.  Seems flawed.

All that said, I found the game to be pretty fun.  The social deduction part at the end where you are guessing who the werewolf is was entirely unsatisfying and random, but the fact that the Merlin and werewolf exist made the question part more interesting.  I haven't player regular 20 questions in a while, so I'm not sure if this is actually an improvement over the base game.  But, I had enough fun that I would play it again.

I've played this game so many times over the past few months, and long sessions of it with multiple plays. It just seems to work so well in almost any setting, with gamers and non-gamers. I also haven't found anyone yet who not only didn't like it but that didn't enjoy it a lot. While it may be  a very condensed Werewolf and the social deduction element isn't as strong as in other games, mixing that mechanic with a '20 questions' type exercise makes it accessible, fun and a great party game. The role reveals can be hilarious, as well as some of the words generated by the app - another feature that really helps this game and gives it structure for non-gamers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Eh. A little window dressing on 20 questions, but it doesn't really work well enough (unless playing with super easy words, the werewolf is very often going to win without having to even work at obfuscating the group's progress) or add enough to be worthwhile.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I'm not a fan of social deduction games like Werewolf. I usually feel uncomfortable because I have no idea what to say or do. Werewords solves that problem by putting the focus on guessing a secret word, if you're a Villager, or steering the others away from guessing it, if you're a Werewolf. So, while it's still not a game I'd pick to play, I would be willing to play it again - hence the rating.

I liked Insider quite a bit when I played my homemade version using Codenames cards. Werewords is a nice improvement on the system. Having more roles is always nice, the app works well, and the yes/no tokens help to make everything more trackable.

I will say that it is a little weird that the leader (the mayor) could possibly be the seer or a werewolf. The mayor always knows the secret word, and those other roles also know the secret word. Especially if the mayor is the seer then a large portion of the game is removed because no other "good guy" will know the word and it will be harder for the werewolf team to identify the seer. I don't like houserules, but I'm leaning toward removing the possibility of this happening by just dealing out roles equal to the number of players, so that they mayor just has the one role.

Overall a fun game. If you've had any interest in Insider I would say go straight to this game which is basically Insider 2.0.

Werewords seems to fix some of the flaws with the traditional One Night formula but may also remove much of the fun finger-pointing and subterfuge. 

I'll need to withhold judgement until I've played a few more games, but if this is a winner the ability to continually input more words makes this game endlessly replayable.

Twist on the ONW formula based around 20 questions.  The Mayor has a word and the villagers have to guess it.  One player is a Werewolf, knows what the word is, and will be trying to ask questions that lead away from the real answer... but if the villagers fail and identify the werewolf, then the village team wins.  One player is a Seer, knows what the word is, and will be trying to guide the villagers to the right answer... but if the villagers win and the werewolf identifies the seer, the werewolf win. (Some extra roles provided).

20 questions meets Werewolf in under 5 minutes. One of the best quick social deduction games for the non-gaming crowd. The difficulty levels raise this game above any of the other super short games of this genera. Plus the difficult word list will challenge any literary expert. Always have ended the game in laughs.

I think this is a legitimate upgrade over Werewolf iterations. The werewolf component is just one aspect of the game, which minimizes the social deduction component. Because I run a large board game club at school each week, I'm getting pretty sick of standard social deduction games. I like the added mechanisms centered around the questions and answers.

Love the Victorian era and want to try this out asap. Just need to wrangle up some 10mm or 15mm miniatures.

RATING: 7
Great fun - Quick playing, light hearted rules. We played a lot of Northwest Frontier (of India) games using Ral Partha 25mm figures.

What can I say?  The archetypical miniature wargame.

RATING: 7
Fun, easy to learn tactical miniatures game covering the high points of the "Small Wars" fought in the mid-late 1800 in Africa, India and Afghanistan.

I recommend using 15mm figures- especially for the natives since you have to paint up bunches of them.

One of the best miniatures games I have ever played.  I continually run this game at conventions, usually with Chris Borucki - and it is a great time.  The game seems to attract very friendly nice players - it plays well, comes to a conclusion in a reasonable amount of time, and is just "fun" in its mechanics.

Fun, atmospheric, well-written, with lots of uniform and flag information as well.  A classic.

Have only the manual.  No box, No plastic units, NO wargame rules for particular battles (aside from unrelated "French Foreign Legion and Arabs Wargame Rules" printout)

Located in "The Complete Brigadier" Game Box

Great goofy fun.  A lot depends on scenario design and back story in my experience.   Of course I seldom play, I usually run the games...

Probably over 100 actual plays. We played this often because it was fairly fast moving-even when we had bigger fights than the number of troops we had! This is one beer and pretzels miniatures game I sorely miss.

Played this game a while back. It was ok, but I would surely like to play it again.

Probably one of the best Beer & Pretzels wargame out there, certainly the best Colonial wargame.

I've played this a few times at the cons.  I always have a good time playing, and it's simple enough for anyone to pick up.  Good Game.

RATING: 5
Played at least 100x in the 80's and early 90's before I got into FIRE AND FURY. I finally devised a system for mounting the figures in small units for ease of play.

I used to not like these rules but they've grown on me.  The de-facto standard for Colonials if you ask me.

After 35 years of miniature gaming these are still my preferred set of colonial skirmish rules.  Simple, but very effective and it is usually a good time for all involved.

Plus expansions and supplements for other periods or settings. I've played this more than any other single set of minis rules.

RATING: 8
Never really considered myself a minis player but this is a terrific ruleset. Only played a few times and long ago (Greenfield edition) but great fun. 
Recently picked up the latest from L.B. and would like to get back into it one day. Although my painted lead is long gone, I could still perhaps muster a Zulu skirmish in plastic.
Any players out in Thailand let me know!!

RATING: 8.5
Great simple miniatures game with at times some interesting results. Perfect for those looking to play a small to medium Colonial action and have fun doing it. Not to be taken to seriously and the focus here is the fun factor.

RATING: 9
A quick and fun miniatures game based around the British Colonial wars.  Was introduced to this game by a long time player not too long ago and recently picked up a used set of rules.  Now I play this one at least once a month.

RATING: 6
Good rules for small skirmishes, but tend to bog down if too many units are used.  The Europeans are intended to be severely outnumbered, but make up for that by having better firepower and more leaders per unit.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
These rules have been around for almost 30 years and are still the standard for re-fighting small colonial skirmishes. Anybody can pick these up and be playing in 15 minutes. It isn't designed for fighting large battles, but I'll pop open a beer and play this any time.

One of the classic sets of miniatures rules with a justified reputation for being fun and interesting. My copy is the old Yaquinto edition from 1979 but I have played several of the newer versions. It's all good.

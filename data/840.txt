Felt very random - the punishment for failing an attack is huge, and so the reward for getting lucky is pretty awesome.  Like most set collection games, randomness in generating sets can be a big deal and make or break the game.  It's barely okay as quick filler, but I'll pass.

A nice average session with a little complexity and not much wild strategy.

Needs at least one more playing.

The second playing helped this one a bunch.  There is quite a bit of strategy hidden in this one, but it still has a LOT of luck (dice).

The term "pointless exercise" comes to mind. I've played several times with four, and games take way too long, have too much going on, and just aren't very fun.  A perfect example of how a game can have only four pages of rules and yet still seem convoluted and fiddly.

Components: Nice artwork, well-produced ship tiles and cards. The colored barrels are difficult to distinguish from across the table; it would have been better to use symbols instead of colors.

Experience: It is almost always advantageous to broadside one's opponent, and it is seldom possible to successfully counterattack. Extremely luck heavy. Kept wanting it to be over.

This is probably a 5 or 6 for me.  Play some cards to match colors up with a tile.  Once you have those colors satisfied, roll dice to see whether you get the tile (worth points).  Decision points are a little low for a game of this length (1.5 hours).  The success of die rolls will make or break you.  A failed broadside or boarding will send you to from the penthouse to the doghouse too quickly.  Still, the pirate theme is fun even though it is thin.

RATING: 5
I only got to play this halfway through, but it really worked for me. A nice mix of card play and some dice rolling for tension, but you've got to make some neat choices if you don't want to waste your turns. Being forced to play 3 cards on your turn makes you get through them. You can't hang on to useful cards, you've got to pick your battle and push on through. Oddly, the dice we had had ornage and purple sides, but the cards had black and white instead. Long out of print, I've been interested in Stortebecker for ages and now I definitely want a copy for myself.
*** Well that was 2007 and I rated it 8. How times change! Played again yesterday (July 2013), it stank. Way too lucky, dice rolls, more dice rolls, card draw, very few decisions. What was I thinking??! It's a 5 at best.

A light beer & pretzels dice game where players are pirates trying to board merchant ships while at the same time keeping the other players from doing the same.

Some of the design decisions don't make a lot of sense thematically (firing broadsides with bananas, anyone?) but ultimately the game works pretty well.

To board a ship you first need to place the proper provisions next to it (yeah, so, er, you first load the ship in order to board it afterwards), then you throw the dice and hope the result plus the strength of your pirates is high enough to overcome the ship's defenses. If so, the ship is yours - unless, of course, one of the other players immediately launches a counterattack. There are also ways to steal or destroy other pirates' provisions (the aforementioned broadsides) which also rely on throwing the dice.

Corsairs is a game of hand management and dice rolling but in contrast with games like Alea Iacta Est which provide ample ways to mitigate the luck clever hand management won't get you very far here when you cannot get the dice to cooperate.

Sure there is some luck involved but so what!!! The game is still fun and the process that you use in determining which ships you will go after will determine if you win or not.

The biggest problem here is that you usually can't assemble enough cards to take a ship in one turn (since you can play only three).  That means everyone else gets a chance to broadside your cards, and in a four-player game it bogs down quickly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game plays well with four.  You compete with the other players to capture ships totalling the most points. The game depends somewhat on rolling the right number and drawing the right cards, yet somehow does not feel too random.

There is some direct conflict as you attack other players to steal their provisions to attack their ships.

This is another game I use to introduce boardgames to people.

Although the theme is meant to be boarding and raiding ships, it makes more sense to me to think of it as provisioning ships back in Hornblower's times. The quartermasters are racing to see who can provision the ships fastest, but there's skull-duggery abounding, trying to steal each other's provisions. The dice off at the end represents how weevil-rotten the provisions you tried to lump on the captain were (unbeknownst to yourself) and how closely the captain checked them. Maybe more sense, but not as marketable obviously.

The game play itself is simplistic. 4 ships are turned over. Each ship lists the provisions it needs (two red cards (rum?), two white cards(flour?) say) plus a dice roll you need to exceed. Each player competes to get matching cards against each ship. When you've got the set of required cards out, attempt to beat the dice roll. If you do, any other player with a card against the ship has a chance at completing their set and out-scoring you. Whoever rolls highest scores it (hard ships score more). If you don't roll the required amount, you roll the colour dice to see if you lose any cards. Turn over another ship to replace that just won. Repeat until the ships run out. It gets repetitive. Especially as there's no sense of thematic progress, or at least rising tension, which dice games need to make them stand out. Just turn over another ship.

There are various actions that allow you to try and steal other players cards (which we used most turns), or exchange cards and seek what you need in the discard pile for use next turn, but most of the game play is laying out cards and rolling. Which is ok, but hardly rocket science. Fun enough as a mindless past-time, but no need to play again.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
It isn't as though this game is bad, but I can't imagine why, when playing this game, I'm NOT playing Ticket to Ride or Carcassonne. The theme is 'interesting', insofar as I don't know what we're actually doing. Are we pirates, bribing the ships at sea with meat and rum to join our cause? Are we businessmen, trying to outfit ships with the goods they demand? Neither of those actually fit the bill, but the term 'Meat-sides attack' has entered our group's vocabulary, so I can't say it's entirely bad.

Reminds me of Clash of the Gladiators - only with more control and a little more strategy. Rare example of a Euro game where dice decide the outcome. Play it for laughs with your Johnny Depp&#039;s pirate voice and the right players and you&#039;ll laugh more than any other Euro game. Otherwise it can be painful, especially after several bad rolls. We played with fewer ships.

Always fun and interesting to play.  Wife and 9 year son love it too.  Nice blend of passive strategy (accumulating what you need in order to take over one of the neutral ships on the board) and aggressive strategy (stealing another player's supplies).   The usual luck of rolls and card draws, but still feel like the best player usually wins.

A vast ye mates! Fantastic game! Very well designed mechanics of risking provisions (to broadside attack) for the option to counterattack. The luck aspect takes its form in card draw, and dice results. However both of these can be contolled to some extent (more corsairs for DICE, and retreiving from discard pile for CARD DRAW). Also, you are never FORCED to throw dice until YOU decide that you want to. Fun Fun Fun!

I do have an aversion to dice in games.  I have come to accept that I just don't roll well.  So this game is pretty random but it is fun.  There's some strategy but at the end of the day, the guy who rolls the best, wins.  As long as that is OK, then this game is OK as well.  It does elicit quite a loud response from our normally fairly quiet group.

Very light pirate game. Randomness more prevalent than I normally prefer, but with the right crowd, this one is a blast.

Pretty OK card game, that playes well with just two. The theming is really bizarre: since when did 13th-century corsairs in the Baltic plunder ships with bananas?

When in doubt, broadside your opponent.  &quot;I&#039;m going to shoot my bananas at you.&quot;  Well-balanced, fun for 2, 3, or 4.

This works, but felt tedious rather than intersting, exciting or challenging. Sigh ... another dull game hidden under a cool pirate veneer.

Good game. Too many ships & not enough resources to cover all the bases you'd like to. Typical of a good "German Style Game".

These pirates go beyond despicable. They will board your ship in a knife wielding frenzy and.....toss bananas at you! 

Corsairs is a very light pirate themed game that will likely not appeal to everyone.  At it's heart,  it is a simple game where you attempt to match colors / commodities to a queue of ships in order to board them and add them to your scoring pile.

The components are stellar and while I derive enjoyment from the game,  it may be a bit too light for many others.

Needs six sided ships (on hexagons) so that we can have 5 or 6 players.

Ah, simple game of rolling dice and battling your friends. Not a great game on the "brain" front, but it is a great one to blow a little time and thwart a buddy!

If you like Cheapass games, you'll like this one. Works best if you use the Faduitti suggestions. Play agressively for the full enjoyment.

It's been so long since I've played it that I can't remember much about how it plays to give any real comments on it.  I do remember enjoying it, but this was early in my exposure to Euros, and everything was fun.  Reading through the rules, it sounds like an area control sort of game with some Take That! elements thrown in for good measure.

Nice light pirate themed game.  Got this one before Pirate's Cove had an English release, therefore this game doesn't hit the table much anymore.

Attractive, fun game of pirates -- but often boils down to several turns of the same actions... still, a fun way to spend 30-45 minutes if you don't mind lots of dice rolling.

RATING: 5
A fun hand management game that has some fun interaction, some dice rolling, and quite a few options of what to do on your turn. The only thing I don't like is that there isn't any endgame scoring, so it can be easy to see who is going to win a few turns before he/she does so.

not a big fan of roll the dice luck, but the kids love it.

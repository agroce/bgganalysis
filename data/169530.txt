Interesting mechanic.  Can be easy to win if you're the first one to make a line, but still chaotic and not assured.  Specially the resistor cards, they can turn your good fortune around pretty fast (though in my first 2 games, we tended to discard the resistors, mostly through luck)

This is the best train Baron/competing mayor game I've ever played and I'm really glad they decided to re-skin it to be about super computers and nukes instead, because let's face it, there are too many games about mayors competing with each other or train Barons being all Barony, and I should know. I'm a train Baron.

Pretty straightforward 2 player game of card matching. Random draw controls the outcome more than the players actions as which power to use on what card is mostly straightforward. Small memory element on making sure the card you flip doesn't hurt your game.

Neat art but it doesn't grab me.

Fundamentally and in regards to gameplay, I like RESISTOR_ but I have to add a big caveat: Depending on what cards are dealt at the beginning of the game, you can be potentially screwed before you even get a chance to play your first card.

RESISTOR_ is still a very neat concept and enjoyable to play.  I think if the start conditions could be a bit more controlled, I would rate the game higher.

What's not to like? A cool use of the box, awesome themed art, quick 2-player action -- the list goes on. But for me, any game that incorporates cascade effects has me hooked. Transistor chains are fun.

In Resistor_, players are super computers trying to hack the other to bring down its defenses so that they can be destroyed in a devastating thermonuclear war. In practice the players put out seven cards randomly between them that have circuits that may or may not connect both super computers. On a turn, if a player can manipulate the cards to create an unbroken line of their color running from their super computer to the other, that player can raise the Defcon level of the other computer. A computer starts at 1 and can rise to 4. A successful "attack" while an opponent is at 4 wins the game. All cards are two sided. Players have a hand of two cards and they can play their own cards or the backsides of the opponent's cards - effectively giving each player a "hand" of four cards. Actions include flipping over a card on the board, drawing a card and trashing one, and replacing a card on the board - all to the purpose of creating unbroken circuits in your own color. 

The initial draw can significantly advantage one player over another. Impactful moves often depend on a lucky draw. A player with a good memory of the backsides of cards that have been flipped has a big advantage. Ultimately, these aspects make the game feel heavily luck influenced and negates any fund that might have existed inherently in the card play. Not a game for me.

RESISTOR_ (you have to spell it with the underscore or it loses its juju) is an interesting two-player tug-of-war-ish game in which you are Cold War supercomputers trying to shut each other down so you can nuke the other country unhindered. So it's a light, family-friendly setting. You manipulate circuit paths in order to connect to the other computer and score hits against it. It's different from a lot of other 2p card games I'm seeing out there, and it does a lot of clever things (not least of which is how they designed the box, knowing you want to hide sides of the cards from both players.) 

RESISTOR_ is a nice change of pace and the matches are short enough that it can come out to play before or after another game.

Hand management with the added twist of both sides of the card are playable, but only one is know to you and another to your opponent. Mandatory actions are played every turn and remembering the opposite sides of cards is a must. Simple pattern recognition is important. Plays only 2 player in about 20 minutes.

As someone who doesn't have never has enough time to play the games I love, I was thrilled to discover RESISTOR_ two years ago. It's quick. It's entertaining. It's smart--and smartly designed. It's even a good game for spectating. I have my own much-loved copy (a little beat-up), and I just bought two more: one to replace my beat-up copy, and one as a gift for a friend whose kids love games. I am not surprised that this game is number one on The Hotness. I hope its ranking helps other people to discover this game I love so much.

RESISTOR_ is a surprisingly fun little 2p game in which players take on the role of two computers, each in control of a nuclear arsenal, actively competing to bring their opponent's defcon level down. Each computer attempts to "hack" into the other by arranging the line of cards connecting them such that they have an unbroken line of influence all the way to their opponent. Players manipulate the cards by flipping them, swapping them out with cards in either their hand or their opponent's, and by use of resistors, which can restore players' defcon level, but also shortens the link between them, accelerating the pace of the game.

The game design & graphics are simply brilliant. The cards look like old electronics boards and the draw pile is cleverly integrated into the box design so that it stands upright, much like the cards actually *were* electronics boards being plugged into a computer! The result is s clear atmosphere of '80s computer geek culture with cold war tension percolating beneath.

Tug of war game for 2 players. Not my kind of game. There is memory involved and double sided cards. You are trying to make paths of your color across the board. Meh- found it boring and repetitive. Riley liked it since he is a nerd.  I'm just kidding but he is a computer guy so he had memories and associations attached so he is bias.

RATING: 6
This is a 2 player game where you have a line of circuit board looking cards, and you try to manipulate the connections so that you have a line of your color connected between you and your opponent. The goal is to hit them four times to win. The game is quite clever. The actions you take in a round are represented by cards that you flip to your opponent's color to show you've used them. The cards are double sided, where you only get to see one side and your opponent gets to see the other, and you can play and manipulate each other's hands. The game box even turns into a nifty game component that you draw your cards from. I liked this game, but it does rely on having some memory to retain what's on the reverse side of cards you've flipped, and honestly that's not me. I don't get nearly enough sleep to be able to remember even so much as what's on the reverse side of three or four cards. I also don't get much 2 player time, so while this game isn't a good fit for me, I have to commend it for being really well designed and clever.

Abstract, dull theme and relies heavily on memorizing cards. I work in IT and even I find the theme boring. Might've been better implemented themed as some kind of train baron game or some prestige fight between mayors of neighbouring cities.

Even then, the idea is novel but I don't feel like playing this game. Let alone owning it.

It won't appeal to everyone, especially with its memory elements, but this is a deliciously grim game that encourages long-form abstract strategy, then poops on your head with resistors, only for the cleverest players to figure out how to use them to their advantage.

A great little two player game with a fun memory element. 

It's easy to teach, plays quickly, and is very portable. If I had one complaint it would be that once you're holding your hand it's hard to really set them down anywhere since you aren't supposed to see the fronts and your opponent isn't supposed to see the back.

My biggest surprise of 2015. Relly great art (The circuits connect you guys! On both sides!), easy to teach, very fun pasted-on theme, a lot of strategy and memory...

It's a ton of fun every time. Deep Red for life.

I had a chance to try RESISTOR_ out at GenCon 2014. Even without taking the amazing aesthetic and design into account, this game is a winner, pure and simple. I'm not sure how best to describe it, but this game makes your brain hurt in all the right ways. If you enjoy fast-paced puzzle-based games with clever controlled randomness in a duel scenario, you will feel right at home with RESISTOR_. That was a lot of words, but it boils down to "this is a super fun 2-player game."
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I love the production on this game, and it sounds like an enticing notion, especially with the actions being mandatory, but in any order; but I felt like I had nearly no control over what was going on. Two consecutive games ended 5-0 for the same player, so effectively, it was 10-0. I really hope I've missed something crucial in the succinct rules (besides mistaken the use of "effect" instead of "affect", which I did not miss ;)), because they really hit it out of the park on graphics and packaging, and I'd like to show it off, not hide it.

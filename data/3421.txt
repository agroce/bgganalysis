RATING: 8
Nice little game that makes soccer almost interesting (almost). Simple yet engaging, light but not without a bit of tactics, ideal for those occasions when you want to think but not too much. Of course, luck is present, but given the time it takes to play a game, why don't you go straight for another one instead of blaming fate?

Very simple and well crafted components. Very easy to replicate with common materials.

StreetSoccer is one of those games that is easy to dismiss as heavily luck based due to the rolling of a six sided die in order to determine one's move each turn. And a couple of plays might confirm that to a pair of amateurs. I can assure you that this is not the case and while luck management is a heavy part of the game (not to be confused with plain, dumb luck) there's enough strategy and decision making to keep you coming back. This is probably my favorite sports board game.

Doesn't try to be a detailed sports sim type game but it sure hits the sweet spot. Fast and fun, great game! A little dependent on the die rolls but good positioning and not always booting the ball as far downfield as you can will certainly help your chances.

Seemed fun at first, but after playing several times against the online AI, the dominating strategy seems to be to have about three kick-throughs hanging around the opposing goal.  This results in a game where there's a significant chance of bad goal kicks leading to multiple successive goals.  Consequently needs tweaking: perhaps an offside rule?

Not sure what to say about this game that hasn't been said.

There's a LOT of luck in this game, more than some people would like you to believe.  If your opponent rolls noticeably better than you (2  pip more on average) it's nearly impossible for him to lose.  Heck, if he rolls two high numbers, and you roll a low number in between, he's almost guaranteed to score.

With that said, I do think this is still a pretty good game.  It's fun, it's rather addictive (I play it even though my dice rolling kills me- how many times can you roll a one in a row?), and it's appealing to non-gamers in both its simplicity, look, and topic.  And there's enough tactics there to make the game interesting even with the heavy luck.

This is a fun quick game for two. You know when you play those wooden fuzball table games or those hockey games with the rods? It has a similar feel in that the position of the players is crucial to set up scoring opportunities or defensive positions. I remember angling all my hockey players so that a stray puck would not have an easy path to the net. 
In Street Soccer, once you have your guys set up nicely, you can pass up to get an easy goal. At the same time you need to leave the ball in an area to force your opponent to move his guys out of position to get it.
It's a good game that simulates the part of soccer that I like best, the passing. No long balls to the strikers, just an exercise in  controlling possession of the ball.

It's almost all luck, but not really.  Sure, if you get lots of 1's and 2's and your opponent gets 5's and 6's chances are you will get slaughtered and it won't be much fun.  However, if the game follows the law if averages and you position your players to minimizes good dice by your opponent and maximize bad dice by yourself, this can be a fairly fun AND tactical sports game.  I have been known on occasion to play it obsessively online...  I really like it and wish more people saw the genius in it.  Of course, maybe I like it so much BECASUE I play it solo, and perhaps it's not that fun for two... hmmm...

My brain's been fried the last couple of weeks, so StreetSoccer (and some of the Kosmos 2-players) have been my straight fare for a little while.  I must say that this is an excellent little game that captures the elements of "real" soccer quite well!  I like this game better than "Foosball", even though the ball doesn't richochet and you don't get cool levers to turn.  :)  Perfect for having fun, along with a little thought (but not too much), when you're tired.

Boy, I was convinced Kristin and I were going to have a blast playing this.  As "simple" as the ball movement mechanism is, however, it was a real, real nuisance to count.  I'm a math teacher and I found it annoying.  Also, this happened on more than one occasion - one of us scores a goal.  The goalkeeper kicks it out and only rolls a two.  The other team rolls a five or six and boots it right back in, being already in position from their previous goal.  Ugh.

Simple, quick fun, with some good positional strategy.  Like the real game, it's hard to come from behind and win.  Still, a quick goal can change the complexion of the game.

It`s a really deep Soccer game, where conservative playing or "konrollierte Offensive" guide to success. Luck plays only a factor if both Coaches are on the same Playing-Level. Nice easy but clever rules. The playing time ranges between 10 - 15 minutes, which is also a plus point.

Whilst not a fan of the real life game, StreetSoccer is more my cup of tea. A fast tactical game, that whilst simple to learn has decent depth, and which manages to capture a lot of the feel of the real game. The game has a fixed play time (like the real thing), which makes it perfect as a filler. There is a fair element of luck to the play, but this balances out reasonably well over the whole game, and adds tension to goalshots etc.

This is a spatial game of sports-themed area control, with a six-sided die.  You have to balance so many factors... keeping defense back, pursuing the ball, avoiding over pursuit, goalie positioning, bending, and, of course, passing, which is the most important facet of the game.  Watch out for overtime -- sudden death can be your issue if you get sloppy in the waning minutes of the game.

Lot of people will claim that it is based on luck of the die, however after several plays under my belt I can assure that it's more about setting up your rolls.
 
Case in point, I introduced this game to a friend after I played it many times. At first I was trouncing him with scores around 10 to 1, however after playing tens of games with him the scores are never more then 2 point diffrence, and usually only that far apart because someone gambles at the end to try and pull in a tie.

Backgammon-weight game, in which die rolls play a big part, but good positioning and managing of probability will win out in the long run.

Its a enjoyable little filler where you are just passing a ball between your pawns trying to score goals.  Roll the dice to see how many times a figure or the ball can move.  Thats about it - though there is some good up and downs to the game such as when you come up 1 pip short.

Es un juego muy bien concebido al que te tienes que acercar sabiendo lo que te vas a encontrar, un filler ideal para dos personas que se juega en poco más de media hora que fluye perfectamente y que fomenta piques.

Atreveros a jugar más de cinco partidas para superar la fase de que todo es azar.

(Many plays against the AI...then I picked up the boardgame Nov'09--20+ face to face plays so far, more fun that way!--raised my score.)

Update, picked up extra copy for myself, gave another copy as a gift, joined mastermoves.eu, Dec 2012. I play this every day with a long distance friend.

FAST! Lots of excitement, emotion, feeling, and testing your ratio of animality to robotics. Lots of little tricks and tormenting mini decisions. I discovered the same qualities as players have discussed at length on BGG (Skill over luck, positioning, tactics/strategy, fun factor, luck crying and cursing, followed by pause and Playing Again.) Such joyful, simple elegance, quick turns, with spice hint of chess, I see this as one of those games that cry out to be played. A beautiful game.
  

Face to face scores so far: Game 1, D5 P4 (OT); Game 2 P4 D2. 
Against nephew, 4 games: P3, T1.
Against Charlie, 7 games, P5, C2 ...the 2 losses which I videoed and posted here!

"Straatvoetbal..." Hey now I speak Dutch... enjoyment grows... Straat-awesome... So much better face to face, but we do have online options for distant play.

I like the new (to me) game clock method best. Start on the ten (9?), count down on rolls of 1, excepting kickoffs. Three extra clock ticks if a tie.

I am still considering (not implementing) the newer rule which disallows your own goalie and fullback to occupy the two squares at the front of the goalie box (not the back two squares--impacted by older rule). I have seen some crazy Man Walls on mastermoves.eu, so I can understand the rationale behind this.

One of the best roll and move games in existence. Once you get over the initial positional learning curve and start to recognise patterns and look ahead, you get an amazing feeling of football. Fast and easy game to teach, anybody can play this. Just awesome, my rating will likely go even higher.

Make sure you count only empty spaces the ball passes through (and not spaces where the ball is kicked), this is a much easier counting method than the one in the rulebook.

Great theme. Nice incorporation of luck (the die)which allows for some strategic thinking. I think I'd grow tired of this one if I played very often, but its fun to play periodically.

A lot of luck is involved, but it's just fun to play and really feels like a match of soccer. This means the boring/more tactical parts of soccer, like 'keeping the ball' when you're in front, are also there...

RATING: 8
Elegant, but simple soccer simulation. Takes more than one game to see the strategy, which centers on long to placement issues rather than individual turns. Haven't played enough to decide if it warrants an eight.... 6 months later, it does (if played without over analysis)

The best sports-related board games I've played, and a wonderful 2-player diversion.

Dice do affect the game, but skillfully positioning your players is more important than rolling high. Great design that is fast and simple to play yet remains both strategic and entertaining.

My only regret: not finding opponents nearly as often as I would like.

Nice little positional game. Where your players are is more important than the ball. Biggest concern was that the ball can go quite a long way which seems to take away some of the feeling for working the ball up to the other end. Relatively quick game too which is a bonus.

RATING: 5
Clever, fast playing two player soccer boardgame.  Players use die roll pips to move players and pass the ball between their players.  Quick passing plays can be set up as +1 die pip is earned for each pass that hits a team mate.  Very simple rules, but the way the passing and curving of the ball works, it does feel like soccer/football.  However, you still have to roll high ;)

Fun little soccer game - quick and easy.  I really like the ball movement mechanics.  In spite of the heavy dependence on die rolls to move your players, the game can be quite strategic.  I highly recommend using Greg Pool's suggestion to use cards instead of dice (see Articles) - adds much more planning and strategy to the game, while still retaining the necessary random element.

I was really really happy with Streetsoccer upon my first play. Streetsoccer is to Soccer with Battleball is to football. That is by no means a faithful simulation, but instead a game that captures some of the flavor of the sport of inspiration.  Where Battleball plays up the concept of skill positions, (linemen are slow but pack a big punch, running backs are very fast but not strong) Streetsoccer is a simulation of positioning and passing. 

Where Streetsoccer really shines is its simplicity. Roll a die, move a guy, kick the ball, hopefully score a goal. My 2p partner was not nearly as excited about SS, but I hope I can find more people to play with!

RATING: 8
The more I play this game, the more I realise that luck is less and less important. There are inherent stratgeies in the game which gradually reveal themselves to you. When I played against the designer, he spent a lot of his turns on off-the-ball moves. If you are losing, it's because you let yourself get pulled into a bad shape. Not because you rolled 1s and they rolled 6s.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Excellent choice for a 2-player.  Easy to teach, plays fast.  Lots of room for strategy.  And just enough "chance" to make it unpredictable.  Everyone hates getting low rolls but the better players will win more games overall.  I'd say play a few games to determine the winner, but that would take too long for what this game is.  I usually want to play once and move on to something else.

RATING: 6
50+ plays. Good 2 player game whether or not you enjoy soccer. Light strategy. I was originally massive on this game but eventually burned out. Recently I tried it a couple times and was quite put off by the luckiness - it is virtually impossible to win if your opponent rolls 5s and 6s. So it's basically a game of 5s and 6s. [Current online record: 21 win/4 draw (3-1 OT)/7 loss]

As sports games go, this has a lot going for it.  The simplicity and speed of play makes this a perfect game for tournaments, leagues or just quick pick-me up matches.  I can only wish I had a game like this back in high school.  My only beef is that the game is ruled by the dice; not to say you don't have any control over what's going on, but the typical lopsided luck factor does impact the outcome.  Hint: try to get the ball in your opponent's corners and watch him try to get it out.  This games is also on BrettSpielWelt which is fantastic when you're short on live opponents.

The goals are actually pretty difficult to score which makes it fun.  Unfortunately the game felt like it came down completely to the die.  I can't help feeling this would be a much more interesting game with a deck of cards to replace the die.

RATING: 6
For a game driven by a single die roll per turn Street Soccer packs quite a punch. In addition to a lot of tactical (and a few somewhat more strategic) decision about how to position your players and where to pass the ball it even manages to evoke that soccer feeling to a certain extent.

The only negative I can think of is that the difference between one player rolling high and another rolling low is going to be very noticeable. High rolls are simply more useful in every respect. It isn't too long a game, though, but should still provide enough time for things to even out at least a little.

Maybe I&#039;m to big a soccerfan to enjoy this game as it has little to do with actual soccer. The best part of reallife streetsoccer is taking the ball from the other players, with a little force if necessary. This is completely not possible in this game. Just as it&#039;s impossibel for the ball to pass any of the lines. That just ain&#039;t right. The game as such may be good, but it&#039;s *not* a soccer game!

Street Soccer is a marvel of game design.  Many games have simple rules.  But what's amazing about StreetSoccer is that its simple roll-and-move rules create a game that (1) is tactically interesting, requiring a degree of finesse to play well, and (2) actually conveys the feeling of playing street soccer!  Finding that sort of magic in such a simple game is exceedingly rare.

If you like Street Soccer, but are interested in something more nuanced and realistic, you should make haste to check out the outstanding Champions 2020 from the same designer.

Mostly mindless dice chucker.  Moves quickly; has room for some clever play.  Strategy is important as keeping your players well organized throughout the game is key.  If you push too many players out of position to score, you may yet lose the game because of it.

I clearly don't fully get the strategy, though. The only game I played with students where the students stood much of a chance of beating me.

Winners can point to their great strategy, while losers can blame the dice (not a bad thing at all). I burned out on it after too many on-line games but I've been enjoying it more recently.

Easy to learn and quick to play.  A tad too random for me, but if you replaced the d6 by an average die (2-3-3-4-4-5), it would probably be more interesting, and less random!

As it is, a "6" is almost always a goal, while a "1" can put you in serious trouble, and both have little to do with where your "players" are located on the field.

Other then that, a great idea/concept, but it needs a little more polishing.

RATING: 7
StreetSoccer is a great quick and dirty soccer game (and that's what it is alos supposed to represent as well: a 30 minute school lunch game of kick-ball). The game itself is simple, roll the dice and distribute the pips between moving a player and moving the ball. Here, luck plays an important role (i.e., with the dice) but skill definitely plays a role that is much more important. Where and how you position your players determines how easily you can pass the ball up as well as how difficult you make it for your opponent. Furthermore, like in soccer, keeping possession through moves that might seem to not get you any closer to the net aren't necessarily a bad thing! Overall, another cute, fun game from Cwali with some meat on it.

I really enjoy this one.  The die rolling aspect can be frustrating but I think it usually balances out and it's fun to try to figure out how to deal with crap rolls.  Even when you have bad luck with rolls in a game it's over quickly and thus not a deal breaker for me.

The game has some interesting ideas and I like the chaining mechanic, but man is it skewed by the dice factor.  Maybe if the game were played using a D4 or something, it would be better.  Basically, if you rolls sixes you can't help but score and if you roll ones you can't help but not.  I rate the game a '3' due to the aforementioned problems and the aggravation level (something I find to be a big offender in this game).  If you roll low on your goalie kick off repeatedly, you can get stuck in scoring loops that are enough to make the blood in your veins boil.

Another good weeknight filler for 2 that still provides some fun, maybe I've underrated it a little but we would almost never pull this out to play

A nice little filler.  With very simple rules it amazingly it does a pretty good job of giving a thematic feel of soccer.  Positioning of men is critical, and thinking defensively can be just as important as offensively.  Of course the 'die of doom' can be nasty at times, but over the course of the game rolls tend to even out.

I play this online at http://yourturnmyturn.com/ . I don't think I could figure out the legal moves without the computer doing it for me, but I like thisn game. The dice element brings a little too much randomness to the outcome, but I think with a dice deck this game could be a great strategic quickie.

I rated this a 7 after a few times with the boardgame, but raised it to a 9 after play this game a lot on the iPhone and iPad.  With at least a few dozen games played against AI, and being able to see the roll differential for each game, I can say this is not the luckfest that it appeared at first.  The die can, of course, hurt.  There's nothing like rolling a 1 between two of your opponent's 6's to dampen your day.  But in the course of a quick game that can (usually) even out, and there's a lot to maneuvering in the game.  (In some situations, the best move is to concede a goal and set your player up for the next play.  And one should think carefully about blocking player movement and passing lanes.)

To start off with the good stuff, Streetsoccer really feels like soccer! You position your players, pass the ball between them, and hopefully end up with a scoring chance. It's quick and it's got mega-meeples. :-)

That being said, it's all about rolling high: Look, I rolled a 6. I guess I just passed the ball halfway down the field and scored. Oh, you rolled a 1. Sorry, you hardly got the ball out of your own penalty area. Wow, another 6 for me. Guess what? And so on...

It's a quick filler and if you like soccer and luck in your games, it's a fine game. Me, I hate the luck factor, so I can't see myself playing this again anytime soon.

RATING: 7
A nice, back yard soccer feel. There is control of the game by positioning your players. It has a very slight backgammon feel.

Explaining the ball movement is confusing for new players to hear; it isn't really hard once you get used to playing by any streatch, but it always seems to throw them. That is, until I came up with a different way of saying it: simply count the number of empty grass spaces the ball passes through; each player that the ball touches can change the direction of the ball. Each player that passes the ball on may bend it (move it on a diagonal) 1 time if they wish. 

Have the new player roll and see it in action.

This is a nice game that I enjoy playing.

Great theme.  This game is always fun to play if you are in the mood to try your luck.  There is just enough to skill to make this a rewarding game.  I think the rule about allowing your opponent access to the ball without leaving the field is quite robust.  Even though there are some unfair-looking wall strategies that you can employ when you are ahead, if you aware of these strategies, there are countermeasures that you can take.

Pese a lo que pueda parecer, éste es un muy buen juego para dos personas, sobre todo si te gusta mínimamente el fútbol (y si no, sigue siendo buen juego para dos).

Se trata de un partido de 5 contra 5, en el que todo el movimiento se hace por medio del lanzamiento de un dado. Aunque pueda parecer que es un juego totalmente basado en el azar, salvo jugadas puntuales, la táctica suele primar, y una buena defensa (o ataque) te da la partida.

Reglas muy simples, pero muy bien pensadas. Y muy entretenido.

I learned Street Soccer as a filler game at a Diplomacy convention where it was frequently used by players who where eliminated in their round of Diplomacy. It's astonishing how a few rules and a single D6 can evoke the illusion of playing soccer on a board. Uneven die rolls will give an advantage but solid tactical play can mitigate part of it and in a Best-Of-Mode the better player should win most of the time. A unique game and one of the best Cwali offerings.

COMMENT:
Initially, this game seems quite novel and interesting. However, after a few games it quickly becomes clear that the game to a large extent plays itself, and there is too much luck invovled for my liking. That aside, it's still fun to play but perhaps not as fun as it might have been with more players on each team for example (there are only five players on each team). Champions 2020 is a game which simulates everything that is involved in a football match, with eleven players per team but this game. It will be very interesting to try this game. Majority of plays were online.

If you look at who designed this you'll see it's more of a logistics game than a football simulation. It's about chaining your players together and trying to disrupt the other player's chain. Funnily, raters seem to be divided between high raters saying there's luck but there's skill too, and low raters saying there's skill but there's luck too. I think I'm closer to the second group: often the game feels like a tug-of-war with victory going to the high roller. For instance, a common way of scoring is directly after another goal, when the goalkeeper rolls a 2 or 3 trying to get rid of the ball and you roll a 5 or 6 to put it right back in. Very nice design, though.

Update - 7 > 8 - repeated plays means this is becoming a group favourite.

Success, as to extent in the real game of football, appears to be down to four maxims; get goalside of your opponent, give options to your team mates, try and play the game in their half and if you cant keep possesion put it in a position where your opponent can do the least damage (all good ideas for footballing success).  But because it is dependent on dice the game is reduced to one of maths and probability.  Isn't everything you ask ... but football to me transcends this ... the moment of genius as well as the playing of percentages ... the numerous approaches to the game (The Dutch or Brazilian versus the English or German styles for example) rather than a strict adherance to four rules.  Street Soccer which is a solid game with great tension and replay value is unable to capture this.  Therefore in order of preference it remains football in the park, watching Orient, Subbuteo and then Street Soccer which is still a big achievement against such stiff opposition (yes, even watching Orient).For those who have not such a limited worldview StreetSoccer is a competitive game with a simple timing system which ensures tense moments and close finishes.  Recommended but not as much as Orient.

Played only on BSW.

Very fun and surprisingly strategic filler.  While there is a heavy luck factor (it is roll-and-move), there is enough strategy and tactics that the better player will win much more often than not. 

UPDATE: Just haven't been playing much lately.  I don't really think any less of it, but the fact that I'm not going out of my way to play once in a while basically means it's not a 7 anymore.

UPDATE: Had an opportunity to play this some more recently, and I had a lot of fun.  The significance of a well-timed 6 or badly timed 1 (or vice versa when your opponent is rolling) is annoying, but smart positional play can mitigate it considerably.  A good, fun, light two-player game.

There's alot more to this game than meets the eye. There's the luck of the die, bit it takes a back seat on how you choose to position your players, and how well you can "milk" the action points that you gain from each roll. I haven't played a game yet that felt like luck every played a primary roll in the game.

I also have to say that the back and forth action of the game does a very good job of conveying that soccer feeling, even though I hadn't entered the game seeking that.

And it's a twenty minute game, so I don't mind the luck factor.

This is a very surprising little game, and should not be passed off as a simple dice game.

Despite the amount of die rolling, and the football theme, I may actually like this!  Need to play more to see just how much strategy you can apply, and how much is down to rolling bigger numbers than the opponent.

Great little football game, short and very fun. The mechanics are simple yet provide for a good deal of subtle positional play--I'm still discovering new defensive gambits even after many, many matches. Each player rolls the die 25 times during the course of the game, so the luck of the roll (usually) evens out by the end. High replay value [73 plays].

A very well designed game that fits its theme, feeling somewhat true to five-a-side football, albeit in slow motion.  The random dice element simulates the unpredictability of football and the chance of an underdog victory, however, StreetSoccer is primarily a game of skill.

Excels when  played in competition, especially in league format.

I love this game. So much depth to it but only tends to shine through with experience. There are a number of rule clarifications that have been made but aren't clear in the rules. I recommend going to Mastermoves.com and playing a few games. This should clear any rule ambiguity issues up.

5 player football soccer..... so.... it is not a soccer football board game because you are missing 6 player in each team, which means a complete different game.

But Corne scored with this board game ..worldwide selling status.

11 player soccer football calcio into boardgaming is DIFFERENT !

RATING: 9
I really like this game. My feeling is that it's greatly underrated. Probably the reason is that is requires quite a lot of playing before realizing its subtleties. It's so deceptively simple and elegantly made that in the beginning you think that this is a no-brainer. All the decisions seem to be obvious. If you continue however to play you will soon realize that there are many decisions to be made and most of them are not obvious at all. In other words this game requires skill. The luck element is there and if you only play one game against a strong player you may just be able to win. If however you continue playing, the strong player will surely come up as the winner. In that respect Streetsoccer reminds me a bit of Backgammon. And this says a lot for the quality of the game.

RATING: 3
I admit the game is more interesting than it appears... and it's more than just another dice fest... but I just don't have the urge to play this. Every game has to have a draw... a pull... a twist... something to get you hooked and bring you back and I personally don't find that with StreetSoccer. I think it helps a LOT to be a soccer fan which admittedly I'm not but even so the game just doesn't draw me into it whereas even many abstracts can.

Quick and fun.  Very light and easy to learn.
I was vaccilating between a 7 and an 8, but the 7 won out as there are just too many games out there for me to never turn this one down.  I consider though, that it will be rare when I turn this one down.

After more plays I've bumped this back up to an 8. Average playtime runs around 10 minutes, which just makes this game too darned versatile to resist.

RATING: 10
I love this game. 

Rules are very simple, and don't really do a great job of abstracting all the ideas from soccer... but the positional play is very interesting and (in most cases) outweighs the randomness of die rolls.

A great abstract, and still one of the better sports-themed board games I've had the pleasure of playing.

(I haven't played the Champions 2020 re-implementation, as I'm very content with the smaller and more abstract StreetSoccer. Sounds like that game adds more chrome than I'm interested in...)

RATING: 9
Simple, fun game with a surprisingly real soccer feel to it.

UPDATE: Moving to a 9 because I've decided to cull out fractional ratings.

UPDATE: Just the teeny-tiniest downgrade to 9.9. That's simply because after 730 games I actually thought about pausing for a while on Little Golem because I have way too many other games going. But I stayed in the SS championship.

UPDATE: Went from an 8 to a 10 after hundreds of plays on Little Golem. The subtleties are incredible and I could spend hundreds more games attempting to improve certain aspects of my play -- opening position, defense, chaining of players, etc.

The players are big and heavy, very nice to handle. The die is a joke, and has to be replaced.

RATING: 6
As a filler game Street Soccer fits the bill - it's light and rather luck-dependent but it does require a bit of skill placing the pawns on the board. As a football simulation, though, it falls a bit short: the initial placement of the pawns isn't reduced to the player's own half, the amount of options for each turn is drastically conditioned by a die throw, there's no offside rule at all and after a goal the pawns just stay the way they are, so more goals can come in a cascade.

RATING: 5
Looked really good, but does not keep me terribly interested. A little luck, no problem there. The problem is that each turn you roll the dice and are presented with a binary decision- a good roll allows an attack, average and poor rolls force you to play for safety. The game is too dour.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nice very easy game which reflect well soccer mechanics. Scoring a gold depends heavily on the die... more than in real soccer.
Modifying the die with 6->4 and 1->3 balances the game a lot (raising the score from 6 to 7)

RATING: 6
Since high school I've worked sporadically on making my own soccer game. The challenge in making a soccer game is to come up with something that plays fast enough like soccer yet doesn't take too long to play. The designer of this game not only devised a game that moves like soccer but did so in a game that takes only 20-30 minutes AND involves a heavy dose of strategy. Amazing. I'm also impressed, as I come to appreciate more about its strategy, by the intensity of the game: play several games in a row, and your brain's really gotten a workout. While it's true that on balance the most skilled players will tend to win the most, it's also true that repeatedly rolling low die throws can hand the game to an opponent who's rolling high ones. I find that luck element frustrating at times. Therefore, I like the variant of rolling two dice and halving the result, rounding up with odd results. The other limitation I see in this game, especially after learning the rules and then practicing versus a computer opponent, is that the most effective strategy is to line up players pretty much down the middle to maximize scoring, which doesn't exactly mirror soccer strategy in that in this game the sidelines are useful only a place to which to dump the ball and make the opponent go get it. But it's also true that playing the ball to corners or to the sides can be a game-saving strategy, so it's a mixed bag on that count. I eventually decided that although the design is very good, over the long haul it wasn't not my "bag," so I traded it. (I've also played vs. the computer, and although to some extent that game's fairly addicting, I still feel the frustration of losing to the computer simply because the computer got high rolls repeatedly.)

Much to my surprise I really enjoyed playing this online (little golem).  Great, addictive little two=player game.  Not sure what about it attracts me to still actively play it after twelve years, I find it addictive, challenging, a bit of a puzzle.

Fun soccer game that you need to play at least a couple of times before it starts to become noticeable that the die doesn't determine a winner all by itself - my initial impression was that this was too luck-heavy, but I've since come around.  Well worth seeking out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A very interesting (but at times a little confusing) way of using a die count to move both the player and the ball. We found that the player who rolled the higher numbers won the game. Not surprising when you are using one D6 to drive the entire game. This one will not get played too often, so I am glad I did not spend a lot for it.

Quick but deeper than what you could think, although I'd try with different dice (avoiding 1's and 6's).

Test it on www.littlegolem.net ! ----

Fast and fun 2p game. Players control a street soccer team and have to battle it out on the field. The rules are very simple, the components are nice (with the biggest meeples I have ever seen) and the game is very interesting. Position is everything and sometimes it's better to sacrifice the greedy benefit to avoid the scattering of your team over the field. There's a good amount of luck involved (a die is used to determine how much can the players or the ball move) but there's also a learning curve. I think the decisive factor is skill and, in my experience, the better player wins most of the time. It's simply a great 2p game!

I can't believe that a half-sized board and 10 meeples costs $35 plus shipping.  I invented the same kind of game as a kid with hockey.  Seems fun enough and might get better once I play it more and learn better moves, but it's a $12 game being sold for about 3 times that.  My advice -- find someone with the game, make a color Xeros ofthe board, and just use the larger meeples from Carcassonne or some other game as your players, and save the 35 bucks.

Just played again.  About as interesting as tic-tac-toe.

I've played this online, and the luck element is staggering.  Just three bad rolls (or three great ones) in a row can get you up or down three.  If the luck element were more balanced it be much more fun and tactical.

For such a simple ruleset, this is a very convincing soccer simulation!  You can play offensive/defensive games, try to force the ball to one side of the field, kick to a corner as a defensive measure, try your best to keep your guys along the center.  And unlike other more 'realistic' games, the simple ruleset means it moves fast!  roll the die, move your guy, move the ball.  that's it each turn.  The die makes the game a bit lucky, but not as much as others would have you believe.  Near as I can tell, the game has even less luck than something like backgammon (another game which is less luck than people think).  If the creator really has a 85% win/loss record, then the game is even less luck-based than tigris and euphrates.

Sure it has a luck factor with the die, but so does Backgammon - another game I like.  The skill in this game is realizing how to utilize the luck factors to give you the edge.  But in the end - between two equally matched players, the game will come down to who gets the right rolls (ie gets their luck) prior to the other player.  For that reason - game gets knocked down a bit in my rating.

Play several games each day at online venues - but I don't record any of those plays, so my games played stats is much lower than actual games played (A quick tally shows 11,863 games played)

Getting better as I discover the strategy of not hitting the ball, blocking (within the rules), and waiting for the high die roll. In the end though two high rolls in a row against your opponent's two low rolls in a row should see you scoring. Still, more tactics than I first thought - positioning of players, etc - glad I tried it out a few more times. It's quick and feels like soccer - hey, soccer is frequently about luck anyway. Go with the flow and enjoy. For a low level thinking game I find it rather relaxing. Nothing too serious, but some fun banter, trash talk and laughing about the die rolls. Enjoyable.

Skill can mitigate luck between an experienced and novice player, but there isn't much differentiation between equally skilled players besides luck of the die.

The difference in fortune between rolling a 1 and a 6 is just too large. A more balanced mechanism would be welcome.

3+2

This is an excellent adaptation of soccer to a boardgame.  While there is some luck involved, a lot of it can be mitigated by appropriate positioning -- of both players and the ball.  A lot of interesting tactical decisions.  Even though it wouldn't really add anything to the game, I wish I could get my hands on a couple of other teams.  One of my daughters has taken a liking to this game which results in the vast number of plays.  [01/08/2011]

There is little doubt that the dice roll governs this game. Regardless of the quality of your strategy, a bunch of good rolls for your opponent and bad ones for you can spell the end.
That being said, StreetSoccer has plenty going on. There many moments when you can feel as if you are playing a game of soccer. Should you chase that ball into the corner and leave yourself out-of-position? Should you try a shot or set up for a shot on the next turn.
There is much to appreciate here but there is also going to be some whining about dice rolls during a competitive match.

Played online at littlegolem.net.  
I wanted to really like this game.  I will concede there is some skill and it does quite well to simulate the flow of a soccer match.  But at the end of the day, a bad roll at the wrong time and you are sunk.  And I really STINK at dice rolling, for some reason... UPDATE: up to 7 from 6.  I gave it another chance.  There is still an element of a bad few rolls can hurt a lot, but player formation to limit damage when those bad rolls come is vital.  With a few more games under my belt, I begin to do better, despite the occasional bad die roll.  Can't see it going any higher, but it is fun and quick with some challenge.  And it does simulate the agony and ecstacy of a soccer match quite well.

This is a wonderful two player delight.  Really a fun system, that unfortunately depends on a die with a game breaking extreme of 1 and 6.  If you roll ones you lose, and sixes you win.  Use an averaging die to bring this to the game it should be.  

When it works there are a number of great decisions here, the way that you move the ball and position your pieces really gets you into the feel of soccer. And yet even if you couldn't care less about soccer, there is still a good enough game here to make this a blast.

Pretty good game for two.  Proper play and positioning will help you to move the ball better and score, but die rolls play a major factor in who will win the game.  Despite the randomness of the die, eminently enjoyable.

Very attractive, quick game that will probably reward more plays with a better understanding of how I can make the luck roll my way. But therein lies the problem -- it's hard to get people interested in playing because on the surface it doesn't seem like more than a children's pastime.

Nice quick light soccer game. The turns are quick but interesting and the game is over in 20 minutes. It's great for kids but I find even adults enjoy it between other stuff. There are kids in my board game club that grab this game and set it up the second they arrive. Some of the younger kids that show up to some of my game nights at the library grab this game and have fun playing for hours just making up their own rules too hehe.

Roll the die and move the soccer ball. Simple, and yet there's more to it than just that. The passing rules (basically, each person can advance the ball 1 space for free) force you to get your players in optimal position to be able to take advantage of your rolls, and be able to block the other team. Fun little game that plays pretty quickly.

StreetSoccer does for passing and shooting at a goal what Powerboats does for racing: reduces it all to a simply understood dice-rolling system without losing the advantage for the player who makes smart moves.  I would like to try it with a die numbered 1-2-2-3-3-4 instead of the traditional d6.

[Cwali 2002 edition] {Dice, soccer; roll-and-move} It is a very thematic dice game, good! Fun, fast, engaging and interactive. Moderately luck dependent.  There are meaningful decisions even with dice.  The final score usually is quite near; so, it's engaging ^_^

The components are nice - big pawns, sharp color, and sturdy board.  My only complaint is that the publisher should not use disc as ball.  I use Tipp-Kick's football to replace the football disc in playing.

The game really transports the atmosphere of soccer. Of course there is luck involved. But so is in real soccer. The better team is not always the one to leave the pitch victorious. There really is everything involved a football heart is calling for. As I lack football vocabulary, I'll write it down in German: Flügelspiel, Konterspiel, Spielaufbau über den Torwart, Kick & Rush, Sich zwischen Ball und Gegner bringen... All that in about 10- 15 minutes time. Great filler for 2!

Fast and Fun.  I love to play this game.  It is a shame it isn't easier to get a hold of.

Update: About 40 plays later and this goes up from an 8 to a 9.

The great thing about this game is that the it appears to be all about rolling the dice, but as you play more you see how positioning is nearly everything.

I write "nearly everything" because the die rolls still have a large impacton the game.

I actually see this as a positive. First, this keeps the game from being too heavy.  If I want to play chess, I'll play chess.

Second, it allows you to bring new players into the game and not have them get crushed as they learn.  It also means you don't have to have two people of roughly the same skill level to have a competitive game.

When you do have two good players, though, it really is tense and fun and usually comes right down to the wire.

On top of all of that, it really does feel like a simple soccer match.

Great game and it has the potential to go even higher in my ratings.

Update:  10.  Every time I play (and I always want to play) I enjoy myself immensely.  




Suitability for Travel:

Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 1
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3

I enjoy playing this light filler on BrettspielWelt, and would like to have a copy to play in person, but can't seem to find one.  It wouldn't be hard to make a homemade version, but I'd definitely buy it if I found a reasonably priced copy -- UPDATE: Finally got this game as a birthday gift, I guess FunAgain found a few copies somewhere, yay! -- This has risen from a 6, to a 7, and now finally to an 8.  The more I play StreetSoccer the more I enjoy it, and the more I realize how much strategy is involved, despite the major role that luck plays.  It's a very tense and exciting two-player game!

StreetSoccer's simple rules can be explained in about one minute. Let me try.

On your turn, roll a die and then move one of your players orthogonally a number of spaces equal to the die roll. If the player moves onto the ball, he kicks it. Stop moving the player and start moving the ball instead. The ball can move orthogonally or diagonally, must continue in a straight line, except that it may bend its direction by 45 degrees once. If the ball contacts another friendly player, that player may kick it in a new direction. Every time the ball is kicked, you are allowed one "free" space of movement that doesn't count toward exhausting your die roll. The ball may not travel out of bounds. Score by sending the ball past the end line from either of the two spaces in front of the goal. The game ends after each player has taken 25 turns. If the score is tied, play 10 turns of sudden death overtime.

I just explained 90% of the rules of StreetSoccer. The only rules I left out are how to kick off at the start of the match, how to bring the ball back into play after a goal, and some minor restrictions preventing a player from forming a wall around his goal or around the ball.

Many games have simple rules. But what's amazing about StreetSoccer is that its simple roll-and-move rules create a game that (1) is tactically interesting, requiring a degree of finesse to play well, and (2) actually conveys the feeling of playing street soccer! Finding that sort of magic in such a simple game is exceedingly rare. Street Soccer is a marvel of game design.

This is Corne van Moorsel's second consecutive year placing in the Spiel des Josh top ten. His Titicaca earned a high ranking last year.

Corné van Moorsel; meeples play soccer. StreetSoccer is the name in the Netherlands (Dutch: Straatvoetbal) for how soccer is played in parks or squares in cities and villages. In this game 2 StreetSoccer teams play a 25 'minute' match.  The soccer field is 10 spaces long and 6 wide (plus spaces outside the lines). The 2 players of this game both are coaches of one team.  Both coaches have 5 StreetSoccer player figures (incl. the goalie).  A die determines your number of spaces to move one of your figures. If you reach the ball you shoot the ball by the unused number of pips on the die. The die makes luck a part of this game. But your choices, like which player you move to which field and where to pass the ball are very important. For the following turns you calculate chances for your opponent and yourself and you try to have your players in good positions for later situations.

I'm sorry but I don't care how much strategy there is in the placement of your pieces, the fact is that a die roll is just a poor way to simulate the movement of players and the ball.  Yes, it is the easiest implementation, but the fact remains that luck will ultimately have the last say in who wins, regardless the skill involved.  You just can't compete if you consistently end up with low rolls.

At first you seem at the mercy of crippling die rolls, and a high luck factor.

This actually came out the same year as Twilight Imperium (1997), otherwise I'd call Twilight Imperium a blatant rip off of Throneworld.  It is very much like a streamlined version of T.I.  The downside is that the components aren't nearly as good being cardboard.  The map can be a little crowded, and the colors can be somewhat hard to distinguish, on the other hand the yellow, light orange, and dark orange do contrast well with the board.

How this differs from T.I(3rd ed.) is that physically it is much smaller.  The entire game fits in a bookshelf.  The components are cardboard.  There is a simpler tech tree with progress not guaranteed, you need to successfully make the die roll each time.  Each power has unique powers.  Victory is determined by owning x # of planets with the throne world in the center being worth 10.  There are no roles that each player takes each turn, and much of the space opera atmosphere is stripped away, leaving only the wargame aspects.  Rules are pretty simple and straightforward.

The worlds need to be scanned before they are attacked, and some of those inner and outer world can be very difficult to conquer.

Solves many of the problems of these games ... players spend most of the time attacking each other, and the endgame does 'sudden death' nicely. You have to attack to win. 

But dry.

An interesting Sci-Fi empire building game....game is a bit slow and will take 2-3 evening sessions to finish. Players really play against the game system and not each other. Im not sure I liked the way that the game develops. Most of the player interaction came at the end of the game. Worth playing but our game group lost enthusiasm after a couple of games. Plays best with 4 players IMHO.

Nice space conquest game with technology development etc. Random planets make for a variable map. Chit draw system is nice as is the need to place 'scans' before you can invade a system (giving a warning to your opponents). Different powers for each race are nice too, as is the background (shared with TimeAgent) Only real problems are length (it's a bit too long) and that players need to be of similar experience or the more experienced will win. Wish I could play it more often!

A game with a lot of interesting element, and a promising attempt to avoid the "he who makes the first power play gets hammered and loses" problem all these game have, but the attempt doesn't quite make it. In the genre, one of the better efforts, but the genre has a lot of inherent problems. In reality, it's competing with Titan - which is a vastly superior game.

What Twilight Imperium should have been, a decade before TI even came out.  A solid combination of space combat, planetary assault, tech advancement, border conflict, and reaching for the metaphorical brass ring to win.

Tentative rating after some solitaire play and 1 game against real opponents. As one of the reviewers notes, it's more about expansion and conflict, with none of the political or diplomatic element of [i]Twilight Imperium III[/i]. It also has a greater variety of ground units which provide for more interesting production and tactical choices.

There are some good concepts in there but it has some issues, too. The first part of the game is effectively multi-player solitaire unless you play with the optional setup. The alternative maps in the Files section are recommended if you want to force more player interaction earlier in the game. The space units were given strange names that only muddle things ("Mothership" instead of "Carrier", etc), the components are weak, and the actions & events should probably be turned into cards so you can get more variety.

But, on the whole, I like it and would play again.

RATING: 7
If you can look past the unsightly components, this is really one of the best multiplayer empire games going. 
 
As you build up fleets and upgrade your technology level, you guide your unique empires from the fringes of known space and conquer the high-tech core systems. Eventually the players bump elbows as they approach the center, and prepare for a showdown over the Throneworld itself. Then output stops and all eyes turn to the final battle. Great fun! Cerainly an older-style American game, but elegant and fun. Buckets of dice are needed and yet the system works really well. Best of all is the way the four tech tracks add unique depth to each player's species but don't complicate the game needlessly. 
 
If you have the time and the friends this is a must-play and is much better than Twilight Imperium, Game of Thrones, and whatever other games are trying to pass as 'empire' games.

RATING: 2
many great ideas, but needed more development.

the map and components are quite ugly and not user-friendly - difficult to analyze the map and see where important things are.

there is no catch-up mechanism for tech or economy - you can't invest in infrastructure or tech, so bad action chit draws (e.g. no artifacts) will leave you behind.

the bad random events should be targeted on leaders, not who happened to roll better.

battles tend to be very one-sided; a small tech advantage is a huge benefit and there is little incentive to split up your fleet.

there could be several hours of 'solitaire' before player interaction.

on the plus side, a few house rules plus better components could make this game quite better.

Probably one of the best 4E space boardgames to come out in years.  Alas, it came out roughly at the same time as Fantasy Flight Games' giganto game of the same theme (but with giant plastic pieces) named TWILIGHT IMPERIUM.  I think TimJim folded tent after this.

Never has a great game been so hobbled by production. The map looks like it was transferred from graph paper with minimum effort. There are myriads of tiny little cardboard chits to keep track of. The type, as Dan rightly pointed out, is on white backgrounds on the board instead of having been knocked out for no discernible reason. But despite all that, Throne World is a great, satsifying system. The different roles are well-balanced, and all this game needs to earn a 10 in my book is a streamlined monetary system so that you're not dealing with lame markers all the time, and some innovative way of fitting all the information you need on each system without sacrificing overall appearance. I really enjoyed playing this, and I'd play it again the next time I had 8-10 hours to spare. It's well worth  the money you'd pay for it; just don't expect Rembrandt.

Sold unplayed.

Epic "precursor" to GMT's Space Empires 4X, with more chits, more tables, and a hideous map.  Picked up with the hope that it could finally fill the 2-player-friendly Twilight Imperium 3 desire.  Punched it, read the rules, and then could never get it to the table.  More wargame than space opera.

Would be intrigued to play.  No chance of future re-acquisition.

I love space based 4 x games but this one missed on so many levels. 

It was as if they stripped out all the chrome that makes these things fun but left in all the length and tedium.

I would much rather play Space Empires 4x, Twilight Imperium or even Eclipse to scratch the space themed multiplayer itch.

Long play time but shorter than a lot of other games of this ilk. It works very well. The player mats are functional and there is plenty to think about to keep you from getting bored over 5 hours (3-player games)

The game does need a facelift though.

What Twilight Imperium 3 wanted to acheive, a space exploration and conquest game with manageable technologies, economics, and warfare.  No turtleing possible.  The board is really awful, and some in our group thought there too much downtime, but we think the latter can be easily fixed.  You get to throw a lot of dice, and there is enough detail to keep it interesting, but simple enough to learn the game in a couple turns.

Interesting space themed develop and conquer game. It develops slowly and takes a long time to play to completion, but on the positive side it doesn't take up much space and would be easy to keep set up between sessions.  One drawback is the quality of the components, the counters are thin and tend to fall apart (this must be in an older version of the game, I've seen different editions with better pieces), and the graphics are not spectacular.  But the game is interesting enough to play if in the mood. I want to like this game more, but I just can't get too excited about it.

Your old style war game, with a very generic space theme, which could have been almost anything else. I like it for what it is, but the length combined with the fact that the amount of dice you have to roll is ungodly make this a mixed feelings game for me. On one side, I would love to play this with a full compliment of six, which would cause much needed infighting (in my 4 player game we did not have the need to fight each other to meet the victory criteria), but then we are talking about piling up about 2 to 3 more hours of play due to the extra players.

I really like this game. I know that it has been compared with Twilight Imperium as being more of a wargame, but that's probably what I like about it. The only drawbacks are that the game is long, and I can't seem to find enough enough opponents to play. It is also the game I wished Stellar Conquest was.

RATING: 7
Nice clean empire builder that needs an advanced set up.  Because this is an exponential growth game, if a player gets humped by some random events or obscenely tough planets in the begining they are going to be well behind the curve.  I recommend opening the game with a homeworld, the two random fringeworlds and three outers in control.  You now have an income and with an artificial boost to your tech by 3 (plus or minus how you desire) everyone is good to go.  This leaves some exploring but it also puts people in range, which is where you want to be.

Otherwise you will spend hours getting to near the same place, with no interaction at all.

The system itself is quite fun, and blocking actions is devious.

Eh, so the endgame has a problem, what do you expect from a 10 year old space conquest game. If you have an issue with it, have the throneworld restock when everyone else does.

Hmmm...my opinion is still up the air on it.  My rating is tentative at this point. There are some core concepts to the game that really work quite well.

I like the combat system, and I like the technology advancement.  I also think the communication network concept is ingenious.

However...the game has some major flaws, too. Number one is presentation. The board hurts my eyes to look at.  Clear hexes would have been easier to deal with. MUCH easier.  Additionally, there are a lot of chits in the game. I think perhaps too many.

I think I may actually create a homemade version of the board with larger blank hexes, about the size of 1st edition Twilight Imperium's.  That should make it a lot easier to deal with.  It would also require making a new homemade scoring track, but that's no big deal.

More Super-Advanced Risk than Light Twilight Imperium.  In our first play we only made it 2/3's through the game and had almost no interaction between players... I'll need a full play before I can rate this, but the "solitaire" expansion phase of the game is only about a 6.

Traded for a copy of Battleline.

First game we hastilly learned the rules, so we did a few things wrong, but i greatly enjoyed this. The cards especially are so interesting. The deck is a pain to arrange, but its well worth it as the game has quite an organic feel to it based on events and not knowing when the score card is coming up. Plus I think i have a system down to put the deck together faster next time, so setup should get much faster with eperience.

Looking back, once we learned the flow of the game, the pace of play was just lightning fast. That is what will set this apart from other space conquests games (other the excellent and unique theming). The end game doesn't feel rushed or like the game ends too quickly for you accomplish your goals. In the end you've had a chance to do a lot, and see a lot of story in a tight amount of game time. I love that.

Ive only played one full game so far, and i need to play with more than 2 players to evaluate more of combat and the game length, so more data is required, but I think this will edge out City of Iron as my favorite overall design of Laukat's. Plus, the producton of this game is wild, the chunky selection tokens are some of my favorite game pieces ever.

This really has everything I want from a game. Immersive world where players create their own stories, absolutely stunning production, interesting choices, and satisfying interaction. This will be an absolute classic in our household and one of the games my children look back at as being a evergreen part of their childhood.

Wow - where to begin. A truly galactic experience, in pretty much every sense. A far cry from the original edition, this version improves on it in pretty much every way. Brief aside - the bonus 'making of' booklet included with the KS edition is a fascinating addition, I hope RRG includes such a release in all their future titles.

I love, love, love:
- that despite how easy-to-grasp/simple the combat mechanism is, it STILL adds tension to every battle
- the ARTWORK!! (definitely a game that can be expanded upon with more and more planets and alien races and events)
- the storytelling! (again, definitely ripe for lots of 
great expansions)
- the control vs influence of planets
- that you can be diplomatic or a conquerer of planets or both
- that you can be in orbit or on the surface of a planet
- the mix of uninhabited planets and inhabited planets
- that control of a region makes sense (got a planet controlled by another player but no troops or base to be found on it? it's under your control once you drop by)
- that you are encouraged to go after a mix of actions rather than just move and attack, move and attack, etc.
- the inclusion of hazards in space, adding another layer of planning your moves
- that each turn, every other player can follow/refresh/do another action, so you're always paying attention to what's going on in the game
- that it's not a small board but not a large board of planets, either--it's enough to have stories and unique races on the large planets to add variety to every game without having just the same few planets every time or way too many planets that you end up calling them by their colors or what animal the alien race looks closest to
- the Worldships being unique to playable races
- the little "holding area" under each Worldship for cargo, disease, and other units
- that the game isn't miniature-heavy, so it has a sort of wargame "purity" to it--you have the info you need and an idea of what each unit is without cluttering up the board with distracting minis
- that because you don't have a starting planet for each player, there is no need to always bounce back to your own controlled region to drop off resources or pick up more troops/ships AND there is no chance you'll lose control of your own home
- that combat is not punishing (so no forcing a player to spend the rest of the game catching up) but isn't totally absent of tension like in Scythe, either, because you're almost always getting rid of REALLY good cards to ensure you win and are battling for real benefits/points, not because the game says you should
- the asymmetric mix of technologies available for each playable race
- that the game allows customization of your ship with bases or technologies
- that victory points can also be earned via secret Empire cards and building and researching
- that you earn a unique special power if you're allied with an alien race, so it really pays to not just conquer every planet
- that you are able to recruit aliens that you're allied with
- that influence is lost by all players on a planet once a battle happens, so you are encouraged to leave troops/ships even on planets you don't control to hopefully dissuade others from attacking
- that each inhabited planet DOESN'T have a blurb explaining each one's story, so you have to get a sense of it on your own as you play the game
- that there is a way to trade resources with other players or the Trade Ship, should you be looking for a certain one but don't want to invade a planet or there are no more planets to takes resources from
- that the cards can be used for their card effects or their power values, making every card useful and difficult to want to lose

I dislike:
- that the rulebook isn't very well done; for example, we had to refer to it a lot to find out what each icon means, and it took a while for us to find them because there isn't a little glossary set aside just for translating each icon, and some items weren't in the rulebook but in the glossary section at the end
- that the stories aren't THAT fleshed out--I would've liked maybe a quick blurb in the rulebook about each playable race to get a better sense of who they are since I'm the one playing as them so I should know WHO they are
- that on the lower right side of the board, there's just a lone space node connected to one planet only--it's so weird/out of place, but maybe I just don't understand its use/benefit, yet
- there doesn't seem to be as much asymmetry as I'd like between the playable races...

Final verdict: Looking loving it so far but need more plays to really say where it ranks in our collection.

Played 2P and 5P twice. Beautiful art and components as always with RR Games. We had no questions really that couldn't be answered by the rule book. The Academy of EEHG won 2 of the games and came in second 2 vp behind the winner in the other game. So makes me wonder a bit if they are OP.  Everyone enjoyed the game play. Right balance of strategy, luck and conflict.  I was surprised a bit at how the cards drive the direction of players. A hand of well coordinated cards can really propel a player toward winning. Need more plays to see how I feel about that.

Excellent game, but complicated to learn initially.  We misunderstood many rules initially and wanted to never play again, but after curiosity got the best of us a day later, we invested a few hours in reading the rules in far greater detail. It was an excellent investment, and the game is wonderful.

I like Ryan Laukat; at least 3 of his games are dice worker/dice manipulation games, a rare a noble subgenre. This one looks more like a competitor to Twilight Imperium or Race for the Galaxy, a game of some complexity in terms of turn structure. Missing is the dice manipulation mechanic, so maybe he needed a break from that. I was excited that it might be another exploration of this mechanic, but despite this not being the case I still look forward to trying it out some day.

RATING: 7.5
Random but fun. Game is a bit chaotic, just like the outer rim of the galaxy. We played 5 player, probably best with 3-4 I think. There is a fair amount of luck. Roll a die to move over a hazard feels a bit underwhelming as far as game mechanics go. Overall I liked it, it's like nothing I have in my library. Great art and theme, and will be a fun one for my family. I would not recommend this if you want a lot of control over the outcome, you will have to change plans often. Good chaotic fun.

[size=12][b]Why I like Empires of the Void II:[/b][/size]
+ I like the mechanics
+ The game is shorter than similar 4x games. 
+ There is decent replayability
+ The game is fine to teach
+ The game requires meaningful decisions to win the game
+ There seem to be the right amount of decisions to make on a players turn. 

[size=12][b]Fixable dislikes in regards to Empires of the Void II:[/b][/size]
/ I am not a fan of the 3 unit limit for battles. I'd like a variant to increase this limit.
/ I cannot fully comment on the duration because I played with a rules mistake that caused the deck to be bigger. I presume that the game is significantly shorter. I struggle to optimize every move after the 4-5 hour mark and the last 30 minutes or so was stretching my limits. I might make an exception for the duration anyway because the game scores well in just about every other regard. 

[size=12][b]VERDICT:[/b] Usually willing to play this game[/size]

I finally got this game to the table this weekend, and oh my gosh - do I love it!  I think this is my new hot favorite.  I ran through a few of the phases solo Saturday night to familiarize myself with the rules. Sunday my husband and I played.  I lost but immediately wanted to re-match.  Usually after one play, I can put a game away for a few days/weeks and come back later, but with EotV2, there is a subtle addiction to the whole thing.  We officially re-matched on Monday and this time I won (barely).  I wanted to play again tonight but we didn't have enough time (darn you, real life responsibilities).  I l've this game far more than I thought I would - and I thought I'd like it a lot.

Empires of the Void is an interesting game. Not so much because of the game play, but because of the history involving its conception. The game was slated to not have a board and be very story driven, but due to pressure from fans, the game now has a board and feels almost like a complete reimagining of the original game. The board was only supposed to be in KS versions, but apparently it's in all of them now...which really feels like a bait and switch from my end, since that was the main reason I backed the KS. Plus I was under the impression that this would be a fairly different experience while belonging in the same "family," so to speak.

So we went from a game where Ryan was going to keep milking the storytelling success he has received so far to being an almost completely new version of the first. However, this game has motherships instead of home planets, and missions to make the game feel less 4x and more like a pickup-and-deliver experience. I am a bit disappointed that the excellent tech tree system from the first has been overly simplified here to the point of feeling very generic.

I'm one of the lucky owners of EotV I, but that also made me view EotV II with some skepticism going in. Unfortunately, my suspicions about this being a sloppy and rushed production were pretty much spot on. I'm glad that others will get to experience something very similar to the original game, but I prefer the original version pretty much across the board...campy expansion content and all. I just don't know why Ryan didn't reprint a definitive version of the original game.

Ok 4x game. Some colourful cards and ideas, the Laukat design school shines through.

Unfortunately, a number of issues with a lack of military incentives coupled with a few luck of the draw problems. There is better 4X stuff out there and the artificial limitation of movements bugs the players. Something does not really gel here, so the rating is not as high as it could be.

Stunning visuals, deep story lines, immersive gameplay, fast turns, and strong replay-ability make this 4X (light) a keeper in my collection. 
 
POSITIVES: (after two games, both at two player count). 
+ Immersive game experience with plenty of good brain burning decisions.
+ Strong in the replay-ability department. 
+ Very quick turns with low AP issues. 
+ The "follow mechanic" really enhances player interaction and engagement. No games of solitaire here. ;) 
+ Multiple paths to victory (attack or alliance).
+ Fantastic storytelling and character development (planets and races).
+ Beautiful components and high production quality.
+ Great game tension with constant threat of losing footholds. 
+ Everything feels very tight and thematically consistent. (especially with addition of Ryan's "liberate" variant added on BGG forums).
+ Objective cards (aka Empire cards) provide needed focus, bonus points, and help inform your strategy 
+ Event cards add a wonderful story element to the game.
+ Multi-use action cards enhance game variety. 
+ Scales very well for 2P games. 
+ Plays in 60-90 min, vs 8 hours like other space operas. 
+ 4x Lite: Doesn't have true "exterminate" element, so when you lose a battle you just retreat with your units in tact. (hardcore 4X-ers may have issue with this, but it's a positive for me). 

NEGATIVES: 
- The instruction manual (much like Ryan Laukat's previous games) is not the best. It's unclear, somewhat disorganized, and requires several read-throughs to fully digest. I strongly recommend you visit the BGG forums for additional clarity.
- Holy crap the set up time! Clocked myself at 20 minutes. 10 if I had a helper. 
- Can barely close the box: Really should have came with an insert for organizing all these chits and bags. 
- Could have used more asymmetrical player boards. Abilities (minus 1 or 2 technology differences) feel pretty much the same no matter who you pick.  
- It's EASY to forget, and hard to keep track of all the extra abilities from races and planets. I strongly recommend a separate piece of paper to keep track of your powers and abilities.   
- Not sure there are enough metal coins (Kickstarter edition) for more than 3 or 4 players. 
- Players looking for a deeply strategic "think 5-10 moves ahead" game, without dice or any random card draws may be turned off by this inherantly tactical "quick on your toes" game. (Not a negative for me in any way, but thought it was worth mentioning). 

OVERALL the game is simply stellar, and damn its pretty to look at! A really unique (and streamlined) take on space operas and 4x games. As soon as I finished it I wanted to play again, and that's saying something.

Only one play so far. It's quite a struggle to get through the rulebook and hard to explain everything is everybody is new. The scorings came each time earlier then expected, but that probably depends on how often the players refresh. Definitely have to replay before I can make a judgement.
One negative point: this is a second edition. They could have improved it a lot by adding icons (of an artifact, a  marzan agent,...) on the empire and power cards. that would help new players to the game a lot.

RATING: 7
In this game players fly around space trying to grab up whatever points they can. There's a lot of variety in what you get asked to accomplish in the deck of secret objective cards and action cards. Some will ask you to complete a pickup and deliver quest, others will ask you to attack another player when they are in specific places, others will demand you go to a specific planet and pay a cost. The game is fueled by a central action board at the top of the map. Each round the starting player moves the action pillar and chooses the action for everyone to resolve. If a player doesn't want to resolve it, they can pay to do whatever action they like, or reset and collect their income. It's important to keep an eye on other players and be in-sync enough with them in terms of being able to resolve actions so that you can benefit from their choices, otherwise you'll fall far behind.

Downtime is quite high with 4 players, and with 5 players it feels like you don't get to do much before the game ends, despite the long playtime. The iconography is also not ideal. The event cards are marked as such by them not having a printed power number as opposed to some text that says "EVENT" which causes new players some trouble when they draw one and don't realize it. Additionally, the cards at times refer to components by thematic name rather than by picture. The rulebook is serviceable but feels poorly organized when I need to go back and reference something. The game could also really use faction specific player aids that explain how some of their techs work.

not a reprint, it is maybe a sequel. Either way, from what I saw and heard, it doesn't remind me of EotV 1. Surface actions on planets. Transports, Fights and Diplomacy..

Ryan Laukat's latest, a total redesign of the original out-of-print Empires of the Void, which was widely praised as one of the best Twilight-Imperium-Lite games you can't buy.  Setup involves putting out a lot of stuff and building the deck with the right mix of cards, but then the game flows fairly quickly.  (We finished a five-player game with all new players in two hours and twenty minutes.)  The central mechanic is first player picks an action from Move/Build/Recruit/Cards, and everyone can either take that action, pay to take a different action, or refresh their resources.  Planets have alien races on them, which grant special powers, and you can conquer locations militarily to build on them, or ally with them diplomatically which gives you their power and unique units.  You can even do both, but invading a planet wipes out your existing friendship, though you can rebuild it later.  Each planet also has a event on it, drawn from a set unique to that planet, so each location has consistent flavor, but variety across multiple plays of the game.  There's several paths to go down to pursue victory points.  I really enjoy it, and think it's my favorite big-box Ryan Laukat game (more fun and engaging than City of Iron, The Ancient World, or Islebound, but I haven't gotten around to playing Above & Below or Near & Far yet).

KS edition. 

Another b-e-a-utiful Laukat game, with stunning artwork to the last detail. 

The predecessor being a light-weight 4X game, #2 takes a different turn. This game feels more like a pick-up-and-delivery style space game, where all players move around the board in order to trigger the mission and action cards in their hand in the right place at the right time, expanding their influence or control in the galaxy, allying with the inhabitants and gaining the upper hand through various boons found throughout the system. Not a strategy game or 'empire builder' at all. 
This is not Laukat's Eclipse, but Laukat's Firefly.

The differences between races are not really noticable. It's not like every race needs a vastly different playstyle to win. The planets are all very beautiful and I like the modularity of the game; different set-up every time. This influences the boons available to the players through their allies. 

I would not consider this Laukat's best game in terms of design, mostly because of the interface. The interface feels very cluttered especially when you get more boons and allies into play, which are spread around the game board or the player boards. This causes errors, with players constantly realising they forgot to add or do certain things because they lacked overview of all their abilities and boons. 

Compared to some other space games in my collection (Eclipse, Race for the Galaxy) and Laukat's previous games (Islebound, City of Iron, 8-minute Empires), I feel this interface could have been worked out in a way that gives the player more overview.

Cool game.  There's a lot there but it seems to avoid most fiddliness.  Need to play it more to see how balanced it is (in my one game the gecko tech race ran away with it).

Interesting. Much like many other space games but also some indefinable diversions that appealed. Pacing is key. It is a slow, measured game where achievements stick around. Liked it.

tl;dr: solid entry in a classic genre

Red Raven Games always delivers when it comes to components and artwork, and so far Ryan hasn't put out any stinkers. I never played the original version, but it's always been on my list. So naturally when this second edition was announced, it was added to my list. After all, everyone knows second editions are better, right? Well, that's the idea at least.
Anywhoooo
This is kind of a 4x light in the same way [thing=72125][/thing] is a 4x. There's a bunch of planets for you to explore and conquer, units to build and stuff, technology to acquire... but it does play in a reasonable amount of time and doesn't have too many or overly complex rules. It is not a light weight game though. There's a lot of stuff to keep in mind, especially since it has Puerto Rico style action selection, so you're always planning not only your turn, but also keeping track of what actions other people might want to take.
I quite enjoyed this and look forward to trying this again soon.

Empires of the Void II raises some quibbles — notably, the movement rules are irritatingly restrictive, and there's so much stuff here that the game takes a while to click — but it also shows Ryan Laukat at his most ambitious and confident, crafting a surprising sandbox-style game of conquest, diplomacy, and storytelling in the process.

Huge amounts of luck and a mixture of dated mechanics (roll a d6 for combat, flip over tokens that could be really good or just useless, get cards that could be really good or just useless, etc). Nope.

I enjoyed my first play of Empires of the Void II, but not as much as I thought I might.  I think my opinion may well improve with the next play as experience will help me ride the wave of the game to a more enjoyable time. Between other player's selected actions and random card draws strongly informing your strategy this game simply was more tactical than I was expecting.  I'm certainly looking forward to exploring this one some more as the experience was pleasant and knowing what level of control to expect can make all the difference.

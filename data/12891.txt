I really want to like this game - the map is very interesting and the combat is fantastic. The strategy is thought-provoking and challenging. 

I see a few problems, however. First, the game takes a very long time and there's a fair amount of downtime (not too ridiculous, but the overall legth seems to amplify it). Second, the way the cards of fate control the elimination of nations and the game's clock doesn't sit right with me at all. I know the rules make an attempt to keep all the players in the game - but honestly, who wants to be near a victory with the Russians and suddenly be thrust into the role of the Imperial Army?

Verdict: A white wine that I just haven't developed the palette for

2010-04-14 (rating 7):

An OK game.

Mechanics are fine. But there is too much luck in this game for me (fight cards, event cards).

Also it seems to be very hard to win with Russian or Sweden - or at least I don't see way to do it although I tried few times.

There is also almost no interaction between Russian enemies which I don't like as well (I prefer lots of interaction).

The main disadvantage of the game are however: 1) it requires 4 players and 2) it is usually long, 3) Prussia player plays a lot more then other players.

RATING: 8
This is very much an initial rating after only three plays and a solo attempt.
I suspect my rating may go up a little rather than down.  We'll see.

This is a good game that models the Seven Years War pretty well.  It's full of S and T, which I like.  In part, it plays rather like the thinking aspects of Chess, the Fog-of-war movement of block wargames and the card battles of Mediterranean.  I like the asymmetry of it very much and the different challenges posed by each nation.

I may change my mind later, but I think playing the Imperial Army or Sweden has the possibility of frustration if your one card draw per turn is repeatedly poor.  It's also got some down time, but providing players agree not to analyse too much, that might not be a big issue.  Players must learn to look at their positions during someone else's turn - so they can act quickly on their turn.  Slow players playing Prussia/Hannover should maybe be faced with a clock of fate of a different sort - an egg timer to speed up their play!

Having said that, unless the cards of fate come up unexpectedly harsh, there is a very high chance that this game will go to 12 or more turns (it can go to 24), which means at least 3 hours play - and more likely 4-5.  That can be a problem

Looking forward to playing it again.

A pseudo-euro-wargame?  (But fun!)  I only have 1 play under my belt (Austria, I won partly because Prussia's last card was the last one in the pile).  Would play again, but only if I were in the mood.  Can be a relatively long game (4-6 hours).  I like the combination of wargame and euro.  Lots of tactical maneuvering, but balanced against the card-playing for the individual battles.  Very interesting.  I'm glad I got to play this one.

This game reminds me of the some early 20th century games.

Although I like the way armies and supplies are moving on a network of roads, there is no such thing as zone of control.

Some events are simply too randomn. It is no fun for the Russian player to get kicked out of the game suddenly when Tsarina Catherina dies. Why not first a Tsarina Catherina gets ill card?

My main criticism concerns the card mechanism. Why use four specially printed common card decks, while the whole line of card driven wargames shows how to go to add historical spice to a game!? And why is the - beautiful historical - map dividid in square sections? This makes no sense in recreating the wars of Frederick.

RATING: 7
Nice elegant wargame. Interesting concept with 3 players against 1. Nice board. The rules and the battle mechanic are easy to teach. I also like the supply rules. The game is quite tactical and I really like that the armies strength is hidden. The game lasts for more than 3 hours but it flows quickly. The event cards bring a lot of randomness to the game almost to the point that the winner is decided by them. Thats the impression I had from my only play.

Having played a couple of times, I'm still looking forward to getting another chance. This game may move up to 9-hood if it holds up under a few more plays. I like the system, the board, and the cards. Players are well rewarded for careful play, but will get nowhere without taking risks. Playing Prussia definitely seems a high-pressure affair, but victory is definitely achievable with a little clever play and some luck.

Seemingly original war game with clever design and assymetrical forces and winning conditions, but on first play, I really had the repeated unpleasant feeling that helpful/harmful card draws were a bit too decisive in this game.  Hooaray for my lucky card draw!  Darn, bad luck again!  

In our four player game, there was way too much downtime between player turns, and bottom line, let's face it, this game by design aspires to produce hours of war gaming stalemate, followed, presumably, possibly, maybe, by someone breaking through the Prussian defenses in a decisive fashion.  If no one eventually does break through, you have just played hours of frustrating stalemate...which is fun for the frustrated players?  And then, the Prussian player declares victory.  Not...that...interesting.

Luck is too important.
The combat system is stupid. The use of poker cards limits the options, so for some countries its imposible to move along certain places if you dont have this kind of cards.
Some events are very strong and others are nonsenses and both kinds can appear random from the 6th turn.
The comparation with WE THE PEOPLE game/system is stupid.
This is no my game, definitely.

This game is cleverly designed, very nicely produced, and playable. Minimal rules, and the cards and combat system work  well. Everything a wargame should be, but it will probably take more than three hours, and the randomness of the "Cards of Fate" may turn off some players. Eurogamers who don't like wargames won't care for Friedrich, either.

I had fun with this an I'm eager to try it again.  It took too long and we only had three players.  I'd like to try it with four, and see if we can get the playing time way down.

I liked that each nation had it's own feel based on its armies, cards, and the design of the map.  The card-based combat system was also neat.  And I liked that it's a cooperative/confrontational hybrid.

Really just an outstanding game.  Handles 2-4 players fairly well.  The combat mechanic is fun and simple, and there's always enough going on (and enough choices) to make the game interesting.  Prussia has a very uphill battle it seems (historically too), but only has to hold on long enough for things to favor it.

RATING: 5.5
An interesting take on a modern 'war game'.  The key element to the game is in the cards.  The role that the card suits play and their relation to the board makes the planning and execution tough if card draws don't go your way.  The game also favors history over game balance, so the victory conditions are non-linear and are based on playing a nation well.  Over all, the favor is with the Prussians.  The game will take a long time to play, especially for the first playing so be sure to set aside enough time.  Not sure if the time investment is worth it, but had fun while playing nonetheless.

RATING: 6
A very elegant design marred by the power AND randomness of the cards. Otherwise, I really appreciate the design of this game and am bothered that I will likely decline to play again due to seeing how significantly the cards swing the state of the game. Spending 4 hours of careful strategic planning that results in an arbitrary endgame brought on by a single card is not acceptable for me.

RATING: 9
Purchased 1/08. Looks very nice and emphasis on manoever rather than battle. Great components!   Can be on the long side to play full game in one sitting ( the only thing stopping it reaching 11). Prussian player must have cast iron stomach and enjoy being pummelled in the end game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I love the assymetrical sides and the historical filler that's added to the game.  It may be long for most people used to 60-90 minute games, but I prefer 3-4 hour games.  It can really hurt when you aren't drawing the suits that you need, but I'm sure with more experience I'll learn to play around this.

The battling by playing down cards sounds really hokey but seems to work pretty well.  The one complaint about the components that I have is that the control components seem a little cheap.  The game that I played the owner had substituted small wooden disks of the appropriate colors and they seemed to work very well as they were very distinguishable on the map.

The allied players need to be relentless in pushing Prussia.  Once Prussia cracks she really falls apart.  In our last game Austria was ready to resign after four hours of play.  I took my turn and Prussia lost 6 generals and their armies that turn and it was all over.

Warning our last play of this with 4 players was 6 hours.  Plays best with 4.  I think that with 3 it's much harder on Prussia.  With 3 players, play Maria instead.

Very elegant design for a wargame that doesn't much feel like one. Very few playing pieces and an innovative approach to combat coupled with area territory control make for a game of manoeuvre rather than intense combat. This plus the approach to supply make for a very 18th century feeling. The way it works as all against one, making a good game very dependent on the skill of the Prussia player, plus the variable cards at the end of the game, although thematic detract slightly from it, making Maria a better alternative in some ways.

Beautiful components with engaging, elegantly simple gameplay. Very intense as victory relies on the proper allocation of manouver, bluff and card management. While technically a weuro or hybrid game, it feels mostly like a wargame.

Some can't get past the gameyness of the card suite battle resolution. It is gamey, but its an abstraction and it works in the context of the game, and introduces interesting decisions.

One complaint, while I agree that rating all the generals would lead to gamey decisions on their use, Friedrich himself was a known quantity at the time, surely it would make sense to give him some advantage as a general.

Still exploring this fascinating game.  So far we can't seem to get the game to finish in a reasonable amount of time.  (Id like to be able to get it down to 4 hours).  There's a lot in this game that I really enjoy.  The card play and combat resolution is really engaging.  The map is beautiful, an filled with opportunities for maneuver.  The different powers all seem to have a unique feel.

After a couple of plays i feel like the game is basically perfectly balanced for the Friedrich player...that the game is designed around that particular player's experience.

It's not that the other powers are broken...it's more like...well...if you can play a song in a certain key, than this game is played in the key of Friedrich.

Which i suppose makes sense given the subject matter, but maybe not the best approach for a multiplayer game.  

While not perfect, it's highly recommended.

Nagyon egyedi, nagyon kidolgozott, és szerintem kiegyensúlyozott is. A 3 fős játék során elég ellentétes vélemények alakultak ki a játékról, volt, aki kevésbé volt tőle elájulva. Nekem nagy élmény volt! Szerintem nagyon látszik a játékon a 14 évnyi fejlesztés, utánaolvastam, és azt kell mondanom, hogy hadtörténetileg nagyon jól sikerült a 7 éves háborút visszaadni. Pont azok az erősségei és gyengeségei az egyes országoknak, mint amikkel a valóságban is szembesülhettek. A poroszok esetében a gyors koncentrált támadás a nyerő, az oroszok szép lassan közelednek és erősödnek, az osztrákok kapják a legtöbb pofont, stb. A végzet pakli kicsit erős, de a valóságban is végzetes háttéresemények döntöttek. Ami új: végre egy wargame, amiben nincs kocka, ehelyett kártyák adják a szerencsefaktort. Engem nagyon kicsit a Shogunra emlékeztet, annyiban, hogy egész távoli csatahelyszínek is kihatással lehetnek egymásra a mechanizmus miatt. Míg a Shogunban a toronyban maradt katonák száma a kérdés, itt adott típusú kártyák száma jelent korlátot. Kritikaként merült fel, hogy a 10-20 fős össz. hadseregméretek elenyésznek a szerencsét képviselő kártyaértékek mellett, de szerintem a katonákat csak amolyan korrekciónak kell felfogni ebben a mechanizmusban. Ráadásul a csata helyére is befolyásunk van. Nagyon jó játék! Még játszanék vele!
És nem elhanyagolható: ráadásul még szép is!

Friedrich offers a wargaming experience with interesting gameplay and easy-to-follow rules.  Unfortunately, the game can sometimes drag during other player's turns if your armies are not attacked, but this shouldn't be an issue for Prussia.  Even though Friedrich suffers from downtime, I really have loved each of my sessions. 

The artwork and cards really add to the playing experience. However, the cards also add a ton of luck so the game ending conditions occur very randomly.  Friedrich also suffers from the fact that one player can draw 4 TC cards of value 2-3 and another player can draw 4 TC cards of value 10-12.  As is the game is hard to take too seriously for your innitial country may be eliminated by a flip of the cards, but it's still a blast if you are in the right mood.    

I enjoy playing Friedrich with either player number.  The appeal of the 3-player game is that the French player has less downtime since he now controls both Russia & Sweden.  The elimination of either France or Russia is now less of a fun killer.  The appeal of the 4-player game is that there is an additional player.  Nuff said!   

I like the advanced rules in which Prussia has the option to go for an offensive victory.  It's sort of like calling Grand Tichu for you are not entirely sure if you can pull it off and you have to give a high powered card to the Austria player.

RATING: 8
This is a great medium weight wargame with no dice used for combat. Instead tactic cards are played to enhance army strength depending on the area combat takes place on the map. In this way a more controllable element of luck is applied to determine a winner, since one can take calculated risks based on how many cards of one type are held and what you opponent's recent card plays have been. Often victory can be assured with carefuly study of the situation and memory of recent activity. With movement restrictions based on the type of roads, forced retreats, and supply trains, and out of supply rules it very much feels like a tactical wargame. Recommended for three players only, it can be rather long, 4-6 hours. However I have enjoyed my plays immensely and still have much to learn.

RATING: 5
On the up side: 

First, as has been mentioned before, the board is a work of art.  

Second, I sense that the game beautifully captures the strategic balance of the Seven Years War in Europe.  

Third, there is the "three against one/but only one can win" dimension, where players must coordinate and cooperate (with limited intelligence based on the tactical cards), but only one can ultimately succeed.  

Fourth, the rules are short.

If there is a "joker in the deck," it is the deck itself and the use of tactical cards for combat.  A novel (for me at least) mechanism, but 1)how accurately does it reflect the combat of the era? and 2)how "gamey" might it be?  

And as a bit of an aside, I wish proper control markers were included in the game.  It is rather cheesy to ask us to cut up a postcard, though I suppose it kept the total cost down.

I can understand concerns about the luck factor, but how can the element of chance be eliminated from a game (or life)?  

This truly is a "hand management" game rather than a wargame.  The individual strengths and weaknesses of the leaders are lost in the deck.  I don't think it belongs in the wargame cateogory, but having said that, I am not sure where BGG should place it.

First Play: First impressions were good, pretty simple rule book a dynamic start and things looked good. I was playing France and got stuck into Hannover. The zones with card suits is a clever mechanic and an hour into the game I was impressed. However it became clear that this game is an opportunity for those who are AP prone to chew the cud over every aspect of their turn, but in equal measure a chance for those who pre-plan to skip through their move in double quick time. I'd recommend the two camps staying well apart.

The first half of the game was good with lots going on, it looked like Prussia would be forced out in short order. However the Prussians need to operate spoiling tactics to stay in the game and they did so very effectively. In short the game dragged on in this fashion for 3.5 hours with no clear winner being more than two moves off a win. We decided to pack up as our venue was closing.

The tapering off of the game and the realisation that one players job was to make the game go on for as long as possible turned a fun experience into a dirge. With that as a prerequisite for one players strategy, I really have no desire to play this again. Up for trade/ sale.

RATING: 8.5
Excellent first impression after incomplete initial four player runthrough. After nine turns everyone was still in it with Prussia just about hanging on. The card play is tense and the maneuver aspect is challenging without being overly sophisticated. Great atmosphere to the game and you really do get the variations between varying theatres/nationalities. Beware, it does play long. I think the 150 mins mentioned on the box is pretty outrageously optimistic (pay more attention to the + sign that follows it!) Can't really see this ever coming in much below the four hour mark unless the Tsarina dies with the first couple of fate cards or Prussia plays poorly, and I suspect five hours would not be surprising. The time flies by though! Rating could well go up to a 9.

Update: Still a gem, always leaves you wanting to play again (if only to avoid repeating that one mistake that cost you the game . . .)
Needs a certain mindset though. Amongst equal players I can't see how Prussia can win if the right cards don't come up early enough, but this is the price you pay for having the most challenging task.

Enjoyable light wargame that uses cards instead of die rolling.  The components are beautiful and the game is a pleasure to see.  Very finely balanced with Prussia going to war with all of its neighbors.  A key tension of the game rests on the shoulders of the allies as they must choose between a)crushing Prussia, or b)going for their individual nation's victory.  After turn 6, the 'cards of fate' are used and bad things start to happen - mostly to the allies.  So, there is time pressure on the allies to win quickly or give up the cause.  It is this alliance/self-interest tension that makes the game compelling, but it also makes the game only really interesting with 4 players.

Quite an interesting system, seemed finely balanced as the whole game had the feel of just being on the very cusp of all coming together - or all falling apart.  Ran a bit long and downtime between turns somewhat problematic, or at least it was for me as France.

Friedrich is an asymetrical multiplayer wargame with a card driven battle / reinforcement mechanic.  One player plays Prussia engaging in battle against allied Russia, France and Austria (three of the players control minor states as well).  To win the game Russia, France and Austria have to capture their own victory objectives.  Prussia can win by either capturing its victory objectives or by surviving to the end of the game.

The mechanics in Friedrich are simple but the decisions players face are difficult.  Exactly what I look for in a wargame.

RATING: 8
This an extremely well thought game about 7yw in Europe. Prussia have to fight against Russia, Austria, France and their allies, and hold out until  the clock of history (i.e. historical events represented by cards) will destroy the anti prussian alliance. Not easy at all for the dwindling resources of Prussia.
This put a lot of pressure too on the allies. Friderich is a light wargame that can be taught in 15 minutes and enjoyed by any newbie.

RATING: 5.1
The game system introduced in Friedrich is very good. It makes manoeuvering and position play extremely important. The card combat system forces players to pick their battles and to pick them wisely. Problem with Friedrich is that I played it after I played Maria. For me it's clear that Maria is a further evolution/improvement of this system and I feel it's far superior to Friedrich. The random events in Friedrich just destroy the game for me. I do not want to invest hours in a heavy game to have my power wiped out by a single event. This may adhere to the historical events but in my opinion it's also really bad game design that sucks the fun out of the game. I much prefer the political system in Maria which gives the players influence over the political events in the game. So it was a nice try, but it also was a big fail.

I really like this game alot. Battles are fun and exciting, you never really know what your enemy has in his hands, kinda like poker in a sense. Nice bits and board my only grip would be that Austria's and the Imperial Armies flags are close in color, making it hard to see the difference at first glance. Wonderful game, I highly recommend this one.

RATING: 5
My only play of this left a foul taste in my mouth. The game was way too long for what it is trying to accomplish and the cards of fate were just luck-ridden. 

To be honest, having played Maria before trying Friedrich really didn't help in formulating my opinion about this game. Maria, although similar and from the same designer, brings a lot more game and innovation to the table. So while playing Friedrich my thoughts were: Why play this when I could be playing Maria which is a step up in the evolutionary game scale?

This game is fabulous! The print quality and bits are awesome! It plays fairly quick and has a lot of historical flavor. The tactical cards are a unique combat system. My only concern is the replay value dropping off as I get more experienced. This could be fixed if expansion senerios are added.

Very clean, neat mechanics make this game easy to teach, fun to play, and very strategic. However, the game goes on a bit too long for what it offers (if Prussia is good), and France and Russia are far below Prussia and Austria to an extent for interesting play. Still, the underlying game is good.

I wasn't impressed. The luck of the draw on cards seems to have a significant impact. If you get low cards early there is no place to hide and although you might not be eliminated any chance to win is likely gone. Four play some of the countries have very little to do with such a low unit count, downtime is a real issue if the main action is away from your front.

A refreshing take on the Seven Years war, Friedrich uses fairly simple point-to-point movement mechanics to recreate the manuever of armies during this period. A clever and unusual method of using decks of playing cards to resolve battles puts the game in a class all by itself. Players familiar with GDW's old Soldier King game will feel at home and may agree with me that this does a better job of capturing the flavor of this period of warfare. Bumped to a 9 after playing again with the 2nd edition set.

Comments based on 1 session of 4.  Very nice combat mechanism : no dice but the outcome of the battle is determined through the strength of your armies (secret at first, you keep it on a private sheet) and cards you play out of your hand.  More plays will be necessary though : Friedrich looked very strong in our first session (collecting 7 tactical cards in every round) - most certainly we have to block him earlier in the game.

Still in love with it. Great game, great components, very intelligent design. Recreates the atmosphere of the SYW perfectly. You really feel like an exhausted Old Fritz after a 20 turn game of Friedrich as the Prussian player. The game abstracts where needed so you can focus on what 18th century warfare is all about: manoeuvre, bluff and supply. Only downsides: Long playing time, sometimes a little too much downtime for the non-Prussian players, especially in the 4-player-game. But this only drops the game from a 10 to a 9. Excellent game!

A brilliant and original game which probably deserves a "10".  My only reservation is I dislike playing Friedrich himself because it feels like everyone is out to get me.  Because they are.  I much prefer to play the "don't mind us, we're just having a look around" French.

RATING: 8
Rating based on one play, may well go up with more plays.  Won as Imperial Army even missing the siege train rule and even after losing TWELVE Austrian armies in one turn because of failure to appreciate post-combat implications.  Card quadrants provide an interesting dynamic where you're always trying to lure the opponent into a suit in which you're strong and you suspect he's weak.  If you can attack one army with two of your armies each operating from a different suit, you have a huge advantage.  Can't stop thinking about the game -- always a good sign.

I definitely want to try it again.  Could this be the elusive crossover "euro-style wargame"?  I love the map and the PTP look.  The rules are extremely clean with no muddiness and nothing that can be rules lawyered.  Great game in that you can explain and go in 15-20 minutes.  Supply train system is simple and elegant.  I wish I would have played it sooner but the "playing card" style deck turned me off when I heard about it (and the actual deck implementation is excellent).

What a great game.  I want to get my own copy but I wonder how many copies of 3-4 player wargame need to be in my group.  This is probably one of the best multi-player wargames out there;  it probably deserves to be in my collection just because the game is fantastic and the designer should get paid.  

I also want to see what Rio Grande does with the reprint.

A very solid strategy war game. Good ebb and flow to the balance. The Prussian player kept hanging on by a thread and getting away one round after another. 

Game is dripping with theme. Look forward to future replays.

The Russian player went sour on this game because the first Card of Fate eliminated the Russian army. I can see the ratinale for disliking this game based on this one mechanism.

Update: played as the Prussian player. It was tough! Absolutely pounded on all sides. It was particularly brutal as the first card of fate caused Prussia to lose 2 tactical cards per turn. Lost after the 5th card of fate. The Austrian player used all his Austrian forces to shield the Imperial Army for the win. France was just one step behind in the victory as well as Russia dropped out after the 3rd card of fate.

I have really liked what I have seen so far. Abstract wargame with Euro-like features. Bluff and taking advantage of battle locations across the board seem important. Very tough on Prussia I think, so most experienced player should probably take that role. 

PROS: Allies must co-operate and compete with one another, making for some interesting situations. Simple rules, but with good decisions. Intriguing combat using cards relating to areas on the map, which makes timing of battles very important. Removal of Allies does not mean players are out of the game; rather their efforts are directed to another army.

CONS: Potentially a very long game considering the payback in "fun". Difficult if not impossible for an inexperienced Prussian player to win (never say never though...). Luck-based removal of Allies from game may turn off some players.

UPDATE: Lowered my rating. This is one of those frustrating games: great idea, great concept, should be a great game ... but there are a few issues that really kill it. First is the monstrous playing time, *far* in excess of the 2.5hr advertised. I think this would be a great game at 2.5 hours, but at the 4hr+ we usually see, it becomes pretty tedious. It's also extremely sensitive to player attitudes. If the Coalition players think they are on the same side, Prussia is totally and absolutely screwed, barring outrageous good fortune. The Coalition players need to consider each other enemies to exactly the same degree as they do Prussia for this game to be at all balanced. Unfortunately, this is just not how many player intuitively play in my experience - even when it's explicitly stated that there is only one winner, the Coalition members seem to consider themselves on the same side to some degree. I think this game would be much better if it were balanced a little more towards a slightly cooperative element. As it is now, unless the game is played strictly competitively Prussia will usually lose but play the kingmaker, which would be more acceptable if there is was some joint interest on the part of the other side.

There is also a bit too much downtime with 4 if you aren't Prussia. Also a lot of luck with very swingy event cards.

All this wouldn't matter so much if the game were half to two-thirds as long as it actually is. Ultimately the length is the deal-killer for me. While I am really, truly impressed by elements of the design, the game just had to be shorter.
---
Played once. Definite potential; it was fun, and I look forward to playing again. It captures one small, but key element of Hanibal: the need to adapt, to play through bad deals and capitalize on good ones, to stay flexible with the sitation. This is cool. The pace can be a little on the slow side, however; I wonder if 3 players is actually ideal. The French especially seem like they're going to doing some thumb-twiddling. Frederick's position is interesting and challenging, but I wonder if the others are as fun to play - their positions are much more one-dimensional.

Also, don't underestimate the impact of luck on the game. The "power" card draws are a big deal, but there are a lot of them so there is some time for things to even out, and dealing with feast or famine there makes the game. But the random events, especially the major ones (where, like, whole countries leave the game), are HUGE, and may overwhelm any quality of play. For the first few plays I think it'll be no big deal, the chaos adds to the fun, but later on, I can see it getting frustrating.

UPDATE: Knocked my rating down to a 7 due to the length. This is a very interesting game for about 2-2.5 hours, but after that it can get pretty tedious. And it's likely to go well past that point.

Cool, cool design. Well done.

Card play instead of dice determines combat, and those cards are accumulated at varying rates by the different combatants; certain cards can only be used in certain sections of the map; one-versus-all system that WORKS; very low piece density; near unlimited permutations on maneuver; hidden army strengths; random events.

Highly recommended for Euro/wargame crossover players.

A cute and innovative game.  It's only a wargame superficially; this is the "wargame" to play for people who'd rather be playing a cardgame instead.

I'd certainly rather play Wellington or Bonaparte at Marengo.

RATING: 10
Simple rules and a well tested game give a strong historical feel for the mid-18th century without the pain of the usual 30 page set of wargame rules.

The players are asymmetric, which encourages conflict. Prussia running against the clock and with an early advantage in cards that needs to be translated into victory. The Coalition powers have the strength to win but each preferring not to be the first man to fight the Prussians. The game is hardest on the Prussian (as should historically be the case) but each of the powers needs to think very carefully before getting into combat.

The card-driven combat system will offend some because it lacks a historical basis, its results though seem to work well. Rather like WE THE PEOPLE from Mark Herman.

The game plays quickly, has a very attractive presentation and was very competitively priced. Highly recommended.

[20/8/06] As far as I'm concerned, Friedrich takes simply too long to play. While I know Richard disagrees with me, I believe the game should have fewer turns and should  compensate this with greater coalition strength and possibly also greater movement allowances. 

---

This game has easily exceeded my expectations. A brilliant, elegant and innovative design doing a fine job portraying the Seven Years War in Central Europe.

[24/11/05] I consider 3 players ideal for the game since this ensures everyone 's got plenty to take care of.

Personally I consider the length of the game somewhat of a problem. To this end I'm considering a variant reducing the number of minor fate cards in the deck, while compensating the coalition by other means for having to win in fewer turns.

Furthermore, I'd find an expansion including India and North America most intriguing and might design such a variant - incidentally also allowing for up to five players (France gets enough to do and Britain/Hanover could be played separately.). 

Anyway, this fascinating game system is very stimulating... A most remarkable design.

A game similar to Tigris and Euphrates, where your tactical choices are interesting but are still grounded by the random element of the cards in your hand.

Clever assymetrical game which is fairly balanced though unlucky card draws for Russia or France can leave a player with a minimal stake in the game. In all three of my games I have seen one or both of these powers removed by the 'cards of fate' which seems a poor reward for such a long game. 

The combat is quite abstract and there are unrealistic 'gamey' elements such as moving onto an objective, away again (to place a contested counter) and then back onto the objective in order to attempt to drive away an adjacent enemy general so the objective can be won on the same turn if the general is retreated by at least three (Thanks, Guy for explaining that). 

Overall, not a bad game but I dislike the elimination of Russia and/or France even if it is historical.

I'm not much on Friedrich's era, but I've heard it's a great game; hence, the purchase.  I will be rating this after I get to play it.

03/12/11 - Update.  Finally got a four-player F2F game of this in, and this is a really neat little game!  It's not thick on rules, and is properly classified as a waro (half-wargame, half-euro).  The game has a great set of interacting players with random events that just drive you crazy.  Predictably, Prussia is the most difficult power to play, but the game plays so quickly, it's not a big deal if you make a couple mistakes.  From setting up the game until completion with four all-new players, we had almost no rules questions and played the game in about 4.5 hours.  Highly recommended as an introductory game to new players who want to get into wargaming.  Cheers.

I have two copies of the game.  One copy has some slight water damage to the box bottom - no mold or mildew, all components in excellent condition.  This used copy is for trade.

I love the idea of the 3 against 1. The rules are straight-forward. The turns seem like they should be short, but I'm surprised at how much time actually goes by.

The combat mechanism has some considerations that are not immediately obvious: like positioning troops to fight in certain suits (especially if you're Prussia and fighting in several areas at once). Intentionally losing a battle by 1, just to buy time (again if you're Prussia). 

The fate deck can be fairly chaotic and has some pretty dramatic impacts (like putting a side out of the war completely) which can vary considerably.  

But if you can live with that chaos, the game and decisions themselves is very clever. I wish it were a bit easier to get on the table.

This game recaptured some of the feeling I had when I first got into European games some 10 years ago, a feeling that's been missing from all the repetitive and boring German games for a couple of years now- a sense of discovery, esotericism, and innovation.  Friedrich is a brilliant, brilliant game and a masterpiece of design work- a more or less traditional historical wargame with a traditional card game to resolve combat.  Simple enough, but the subtleties of design decisions are difficult to describe without being able to demonstrate the experiential realizations that you will come to during the game as you become aware of how it all fits together.  Beautiful.

Un jeu vraiment plaisant comme son "amie" Maria...Rien à dire c'est parfait avec des rôles équilibrés et des stratégies différentes à mener pour tous les joueurs.
Un petit point quand même en moins que Maria (9 au lieu de 10), car le jeu est légèrement trop long et ne tient pas sur une après-midi si les joueurs sont de niveau équivalent...

A war/euro hybrid.  The difference for me on Friedrich, is that unlike Byzantium (which is still on my wishlist hanging by a thread), this one incorporates historic aspects that appeal to me.  Compliments of my Secret Santa, this one is now resting on my games shelf!!!  This one is on the verge of getting played.  Am scheduling a game in the next couple of weeks!

Good crossover game between war- and eurogame genre. Unfortunately, it plays too long for a eurogame (we took 4h for 7 turns) and has quite some downtime. I cannot see this hitting the table too often.
It does a fabulous job at recreating the difficulties of fighting on all fronts at the same time with limited resources. It also depicts the fragile alliance between Prussia's enemies: they cannot win if they don't work together, but everyone wins by himself.

Elegant strategic level crossover (euro/wargame) game that hits my wargaming roots and my current euro tastes perfectly.  In this, it reminds me of A House Divided.  Another simple, but quite exceptional, strategic level wargame.

Production values are nice but could be better (Forget the chintzy postcard, find some transparent plastic bingo chips).  In some ways the game feels just a step above a prototype (did they really need to keep the standard suits?).

Highly recommended!

Love this. 
Area control, huge maps, great historic theme. 

The tension playing as Friedrich is great, a lot of bluffing and high stake conflict. At my current level of understanding conflict in the game makes me believe constant small retreats as Friedrich, only commiting when required is a pretty optimal stratergy. More plays will shed light on this, keen to play as Maria and press Friedrich's weaknesses using stacked armies to see if this changes the constant retreat style of play. 

Keen to play 4P and 3P as Maria

Not a Euro.  Not a traditional 'Big Stack' wargame.  No dice.  Just cards, a great map, and a vicious game of time and manuever that really captures well the FEEL of the 7 Years War.  Prussia battles against overwhelming odds, with only interior lines of communication and a first rate army (bigger card hand) to protect King Friedrich's aim to increase Prussian power.  If you're looking for a 'wareuro', this ain't it.  Its not a Martin Wallace design.  It also isn't a traditional wargame- no CRT's, etc.  But it is one of the more unique and intelligent wargames I've seen in years.  Highly recommended.

9/02/21- Initial rating based on one play with three players. All I can say is many decisions, twists at every turn and a wargame (it is a wargame) that my wife LIKES! Oh rapture!

09/11/13- Three plays now and but for the fact that it is difficult to get a 3-4 hour block of time together with small children in the house I would love to play it more. 

I have seen some complaints about the cards of fate. Personally I think the game would be much the weaker for their omission. They add a heady tension to the game where each turn of the deck can bring your plans crashing down and force you to look at perusing victory in a new light. Even once receiving the draw reducing "Poems" and "Lord Butt" cards as the first two draws as Prussia I did not feel cheated by fate (well perhaps a little). The challenge simply increased and forced a more conservative play.

Good game of playing cat & mouse. Playing Prussia is a very paranoid experience: I like it!

Compare with MARIA
Another vote for Maria. It's much more nuanced, strategically and diplomatically. As others have note, though, Friedrich has more straightforward fighting and works well with 3 in addition to its optimal 4, so only get Maria if you think you can get exactly two other players who enjoy diplomatic elements.
As an inexperienced player who loves both, I find Friedrich to be a more straightforward "fight fight fight!" kind of game, while Maria is more complex and subtle. Which one is right for you depends on your group, but as a whole I generally feel more comfortable recommending Maria because Friedrich has a few potential pitfalls: it can be a very long game, there is less inherent interaction between the non-Prussian players (it's all vs 1, but there's only one winner), and some people hate the Cards of Fate concept.

It was a very good game, with lots of stuff to do and lots of options.  The card play is very key, which adds a very intriguing layer to the game.  It's like yer playin' a card game and a war game at the same time.  My only complaint is that I wish it were shorter, but this is a minor complaint...

Interesting card combat system.  Lots of tension.  A long game (3+ hrs) but rules were simple and easy to learn as war games go.  Prussian player must play well to succeed.  Others must keep at him to not let his hand get too strong.  Makes the game truly a 3 on 1 so Prussian player better be ok with that.  I think the game really must have 4 to play so this may limit opportunities to get it on the table.

RATING: 8
Friedrich really hits the sweet spot between Euros and wargames like few games ever have, appealing to both types of players.  It's a very clever, elegant, and simple (by wargame standards) system that has room for strategic variety and slick play.  It can run a little long, and it has balance issues (it can be over in 6 turns or last for more than 20, which has a huge effect on how tough it is for the Prussian player, who has a hard row to hoe as it is), but it's so much fun to play that those can be overlooked.  Also, with experience, a good Prussian player has a decent shot at overcoming the imbalance.

Update: Dropped from a 9 to an 8 because it just takes too long to play.  If this were a 3-hour game then it'd still be a 9, but it can easily run more like 5.  Too much luck in the variable ending for that long of a game.

RATING: 7
I played [i]Maria[/i] before this, so I pretty well knew what to expect going it. It's more or less the same game, but with no political track and a random events deck. It can be played 4p but in practice I suspect you'll want to play this as a 3p game most of the time. If Russia leaves early, playing just Sweden will be quite dull.

On the one hand, I think it's a slightly more interesting situation militarily. On the other, that hand of fate deck feels quite chaotic. The difference between the Russians going out on turn 6 vs turn 12 or later could be game deciding. I understand not wanting to put a game on rails and the desire to generate a new narrative each game, but that seems a bit much. Also, the lack of a political track makes the hand management a bit less interesting.

So, on the whole, still a pretty good game, but [i]Maria[/i] has the edge.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Its a cliche, but this is a great example of the new hybrids: Very simple & clean mechanisms, nice bits, but a hard wargame edge to the strategy. 
Minor issue 1: I felt a bit sorry for my non-Prussian opponents who had more down time. I wonder if it might be better to have 2 players team up to control Prussia/Hannover since the decisions on each front are often isolated.
Minor Issue 2: The card suits do seem strange ("So because I fought a big Clubs battle in Sweden, I'd better defend the Danube a bit further downstream in Diamonds?")
Minor Issue 3: I suspect each player's chance to win is influenced more by the event cards than how they play.
Despite all that, I loved it and can't wait to play again.

Really enjoyed my first play of this - and based on that would rate it an 8. However I am a little concerned that some plays could result in a lock-out game for one of the players - which given how long the game runs might not be fun. In fairness the game does try to mitigate this but it could still mean it falls a little flat on some plays.

Overall though this does a lot of things well.

- The battle resolution mechanic is unique and although rather artificial does deliver some excellent, and subtle,  tactical and strategic decision making.
- The game is simple - there are no fiddly rules to keep looking up.
- Very asymmetric.
- Nice board.

Look forward to playing this again - or Maria.

RATING: 7
A breath of fresh air.  An assymetrical war/boardgame with 2-3 players up against the lonely Prussian player.  Each non-Prussian player has their own goals, but if they are the first to nibble at Prussia, they'll be smacked down - which may allow somebody else to win.  Meanwhile, Prussia is basically fighting the clock, trying to beat back the pesky attacks.  The game will end when a non-Prussian player takes their own chunk of territory, or Prussia survives by the event deck knocking the other players out of the game.  Rules-wise this is a very simple game, how you play it is not so simple.  The game cleverly portrays how armies act in proximity to each other.  Lovely components too.

RATING: 9.5
A true gem of a game.  Tense throughout.  I, personally, cannot rate it higher because of realism and historicity issues, but the designer clearly hit his mark and worked in the amount of realism and historicity he wanted.  By far the most curious rule is the restriction that no objective can be converted if an enemy force is within 3 towns.  By far the most curious anomaly for a game on 18th Century warfare is the absence of fortresses.  These two curiosities actually work together.  Whether or not the objectives are actually forts, think of them as representative of the fortresses in the area.   What the game is saying is that you cannot take a fortress as long as an enemy army is in the field to contest your siege.  While that is not strictly true, it explains why the game works as well as it does.  [Vauban was quite clear on the subject: no fortress can withstand an sustained, determined siege.  The defenders must ultimately rely on the presence, or threat, of a relieving army for their deliverance.] The Prussian army running amok in Upper Silesia is not a gamey attempt at guerilla warfare; it is a mobile defense in a fortified zone.  A surprising and elegant design.

Excellent game of a new tradition of German game designers looking for american style wargames as inspiration (instead of the other way round).

Fun wargame with a simple set of rules to learn and play. Very easy to pick up but the way the cards interface with the movement and combat through the 'suits' map grid means there's a fair amount of strategy and thought in the game. There's some extent of luck of the draw in the tactical cards, but the amount of cards you draw does historically reflect the capabilities of the countries involved. And well, this game is all about hand management.

The real luck of the draw is in the event cards. They do create tension in the game but control is completely out of a player's hand. If Elisabeth dies, Russia is out. That's that. While the probability of it being the first card of the draw is slim, having it occur cannot be any fun for the Russian player! 

Overall, this is a fun game for me, but the fact that there is a possibility that a player can get knocked out for no darn good reason beyond the luck of the draw is a dampener. This is one of those occasions where historical accuracy may be too uncomfortable for a game. While Frederick was saved by the tsarina's death, giving a player the shaft through the luck of the draw is probably not an ideal state.

One of the best 4 player games out there.  Prussia (Frederick) has to just stay in being and avoid one of the others winning.  Russia wants to get its foot in the door, Austria wants Silesia back and to restore Saxony and France wants over the Rhine into Hanover and elsewhere.  Very balanced, which is a remarkable achievement considering the complexity of 18th century politics. Challenging combat system in that you have to judge carefully where and when to use your combat resources.   Great game!

Having finally played, the common criticisms of the game were apparent.  Not quickly paced, not a game for everyone, considerable rewards fragile against impatient opposition.

However, this is board game design as art and science, instead of commerce.  A guy spends years and years designing something wholly original.  I have come across no game more beautifully produced or with a more elegant resolution of complex machinations.  That the game gets pilloried for being too thematic (deck of fate) and not thematic enough (card suits) indicates just how strikingly different it is.

I worry that replayability could be harmed by the fixed control points, but the yearly tournament suggests otherwise.  I need more games to see how different card draws can create totally different game play.  Attack Prussia early and often!  It is not good if Prussia banks a big early lead and the game has many, many turns before victory can be confirmed.

A one of a kind experience, that's for sure. I think what the designer has done here with only a few pages of rules is, and I use this word carefully, brilliant. The poker card mechanism sounds rather insipid on paper but is quite tense and interesting in practice. As someone who loves tactical map considerations, I'm in heaven here with the multitude of movement choices. The supply trains add a whole other layer to the game.

In spite of all that, the game does have flaws, and I'm not sure exactly what I think of it. I'm concerned that the deck of fate plays too large a part in determining who wins rather than the skill of the players. One thing is for sure, you need to have a competent Prussian player to give everyone a fair shot at winning.

I will never play this again.

I find the map to be very busy; for a game with so many abstracted design concepts, the amount of spaces are overkill.

Due to the card/deck mechanism if you are a mediocre card counter you will have to really mess up to lose as Prussia.

The retreat rules can take a non-Prussia player out of the game in one unfortunate combat forcing them to limp for a long time knowing full well a fate card can remove them from play while the are trying to get back in the mix.

I disliked the control sheets intensely as it was beyond irritating having to record information in a boardgame; particularly a wargame/euro hybrid.

After discussing gameplay with the designer and others, I see how this could be played better by a group of players more familiar with game, but I don't enjoy the map or the control sheet.

An amazing game experience, despite the heavy, "Euro-like" abstractions.  Well simulates the 7 Years War and it's very difficult for Frederick the Great to win, as it was historically.

Can't recommend this game enough!

Rating after one play. I'm not a fan of the longer games, but after an initial 5.5 hour game of this, I would like to try it again. There is a lot of subtle planning that goes on, trying to match up suits to places you want to squat for combat. I was able to eke out a victory after two rounds as Austria after France and Russia had two rounds of heavy combat with Prussia, leaving him with ~6 cards left. I don't believe there's an issue with 'random' card draws that leave you with nothing to do with for rounds on end. Each superpower gets enough cards in a round that strong suits cycle through fairly often... as long as you plan properly, this isn't an issue.

An incredible disappointment.  One of the few highly-rated games that I feel is bad (as opposed to not for me).
The retreat rules are spectacularly dumb, allowing the winner to determine where the losers' army goes.  The game is incredibly slow, with lots of downtime.  Requires cooperation among non-Prussian players, but doesn't provide enough incentive to do so.  I can't imagine ever playing this again.  Honestly, I have that "I must have played this wrong" feeling, but even with adjustments, I don't think there's any way I can enjoy this.

After our first game which ended with a total massacre of Friedrich before the first fate card was drawn, we decided to give it another go.  This time with the benefit of hindsight of some spectacular blunders and monumental mistakes, we discovered a deep rich and sneaky gem of a game.  Winning with any side is a real challenge, but to last to the end with the Prussian requires great skill and a fair amount of luck.  I can see how the real Frederick was fortunate to see his opponents drop one after the other; if the alliance players really coordinate their efforts, it is near impossible for Prussia to hold out for very long.  Excellent, difficult and very tactical.  A word to the wise: do not defend in more than two territories of the same suit; rhis is begging for a thorough shellacking.

Played once as Russia/Sweden.  It's a pretty fascinating wargame, but it can also be tedious and frustrating.

Still, we're planning to try this again with the advanced rule where Prussia can invade Austria.

RATING: 9
Update: Played again and I was struck at how simple the rules are and how much of a brain burner this game is.  Keeping track of the suits played and keeping an eye on the complex point to point map is lots of mental work.  The map has dead ends as well as close or loosely spaced areas that speed up or slow down movement.  And watch out for your supply trains!  I have to bump my rating upwards for this elegant wargame.

A beautiful game that is very fresh with the card battle thing going on.  It would rate higher but it takes a while and is a 'set in stone' single scenario where Prussia is always defensive.  I mean really defensive.  This might limit the replay for me, although I think the game has lots of depth and is fun.  Worth a try and a game I like.  If it gets played more often it might rate higher.

As a cross over euro-wargame:
I think it's too long with potential downtime that might turn off eurogamers (lots of thinking and pondering in this game.  Mistakes in piece placement can set you back for turns.  It's hard to play in a casual way).  Although wargamers would feel right at home.  I think Shogun is a better euro crossover for eurogamers (despite all it's rules), and Hammer of the Scots has funner mechanics to draw them in.  Despite its fun combat cardplay Friedrich moves slower than either of the above games and would not be the first cross over euro-wargame I'd recommend.  Very nice as a light wargame tho...

 Friedrich is a great 'experience' game that really puts you in the time period of the action and almost invites a role-playing feeling.  It has fantastic artwork and theme.  Really classy.

After my first two games I definitely started to like it and I hope to get to play it more. However, I might have some issues with the cards of fate but I suspect that if you accept that there are things outside of our control, it won't be a problem anymore.

Have played once, 3-player. 2.5 hours. Clean mechanics. Prussia is difficult to play on the first try--must play well. A promising game and probably will be rated better. After 2nd   3rd play: an excellent design. Bravo to Richard Sivel. 4-5 hours. The best 3-4 player game in my collection. 4th game: 3.5 hours. Austria won a close 4-player game on the 13th turn. Russia could have won had the game continued one more turn, and France had a good chance earlier on. Great game!

Great game! Played a 3-player game for the first time (for all) that had to be cut short due to one player who had to leave after about 3 hours. We all wanted to play again, especially in a four player game. I was Prussia/Hanover and got on tenter hooks after about 4 turns and was eargerly awaiting the cards of fate to ease my burden.

After a few turns to get up the number of cards in my hand, combat began in earnest. After a few battles, it became a difficult decison as to whom to battle and within which suit area to do so.

While I was able to keep Russia chasing me in the East and eliminated Sweden as a fighting force, I didn't pay enough attention to France in the West.

Austria bid his time in the South as he carefully judged my weak suit(s) and then attacked around turn 4-5. I was able to parry, take 1 army losses (one advantage of drawing the most cards/turn was having a sufficient range of suited cards to get to -1 and retreat) and just backed up ever so slowly while awaiting the fate cards to take effect, hopefully for the betterment of Friedrich. It was driving Austria up a tree!

Top notch and beautiful components/board. Ingenious and nailbiting combat system using four, separately accessed decks of cards each having four suits of cards (numbers 2-13) and two Reserve cards (any suit, your choice of number 1-10) whose numbers are added to your intrinsic army(s) strength(s) in alternating player phases.

Highly recommended! A+++++

I expect my rating will increase after a few more plays.

Very simple rules, but the result is still quite "wargame-like". I like the assymetrical setting, and it feels like it was very well playtested. I also like the card-based gameplay, it is still quite random but it is quite fresh when compared to standard dice-rolling mechanisms usual in this kind of game.

The combination of historical elements, unpredictable fate cards, chess-like maneuvering, and deception as to your zones of strength makes for a game I consider one of the greats.  Prone to analysis paralysis, though, so bring a timer.  One side of me is looking forward to playing as the Prussians, the other side dreads it.  

The fate cards alone introduce a huge element of luck as to who wins, which normally diminishes a game's appeal for me, but everything else about this game is so great that I can live with it.  Best not to be overly concerned with the final outcome and just enjoy the journey.

Again and again interesting new situations crop up in this game. The game is almost always quite tense, and it's a wonderful social "event." Long playing time just means that the entertainment lasts longer! I don't mind the luck with the Cards of Fate. How would you know when these historical events were actually going to happen in real life? Also, the different suits are a great innovation for wargames, and I think they're actually "historical" (despite what some say). They represent certain kinds of resources, and also certain complications with terrain, etc.--things that are too intricate to portray in a conventional wargame. The tactical cards add a whole lot of good decision-making. Granted, the system for fighting a battle isn't *completely* realistic. For instance, it is impossible to recreate the battle of Zorndorf, where BOTH sides took immense casualties (only the losing side can  take casualties). For the most part, however, the combat system is very effective. Overall: a great game, a real classic!

RATING: 8
An amazing blend of both Euro and war, with elegant and clean play design.  Strategy, timing and bluff all lend themselves to making this game always feel tense.  Some of the choices do feel gamey rather than thematic, but the over all feel, with different victory conditions, and the cards of fate breathe into the game what theme may be extracted.  All in all a brilliant design I can't wait to play again.

UPDATE: Lowering to an 8.  Friedrich is a strong design, but the length often begins to create impatience in players.  This is especially the case with 4. The way the countries are designated in a four player upon initial setup create substantial downtime for two players.  With all this said though Friedrich is still a brilliant game.

Brilliant game of the 7 Years War in Europe.  I find myself thinking about new strategies to use, and I've played the game almost 20 times in 9 months.  Anything that can keep me that enthralled for so long must have something to it.  Perhaps I'm just easily amused.

Despite one potential flaw (luck in the Deck of Fate) and the downside of playtime (2 1/2 to 5 hours) this is without question my favorite game.  The play is to give yourself the best chance to win, and sometimes fate won't let you.  If you accept that it becomes a beautiful game.

Really enjoyed this. Friedrich is a masterpiece of game design; the mechanics are straightforward, but offer plenty of opportunities for strategic thinking. Great tension. There is a fair amount of downtime between turns, but I didn't have much difficulty filling that time by planning my future moves or watching the entertaining card-based combat unfold.  The asymmetric play is interesting.

Nice board, and a manageable quantity of bits. Not the least bit fiddly.

The rules are simple, and the card-based combat is a blast. But the strategy can sometimes hurt the heads of my less game-friendly group members.

Hmmm.  I am not sure about this one.  I suspect that even after being familiar with the game, it could drag a bit, especially if Prussia is good.  There is downtime as well as players play multiple countries and they have a hand of cards for each country.  It can be limiting playing countries with just one or two pieces, so in a way it was more rewarding to play Prussia.  Not having the right cards for a particular region can be pretty big, and if you are Prussia you need the fate cards to take countries out promptly so that you can win.  I am just not sure it was that satisfying a game considering the time investment.  It could be that I like games where you build up an Empire, and in Friedrich you draw your strength randomly and then move accordingly and hope the fate cards work in your favor, or at least not against you.

I have no idea what kind of kool aid others are drinking on this one.  It barely functions.  There are far too few units, leading to stalemate-y formulaic patterns and making the smaller powers laughably irrelevant.  The card system is a neat-sounding idea but is rubbish in practice.  It makes for mindless, artificial strategies and further constrains a system that is already too limiting.  And let's not even mention the "Cards of Fate" - it's too frightening a topic.  An amazing 94% of raters have given Friedrich a '6' or better, so perhaps I'm just dense.

A damn fine game. This one surges to the top of the must play again pile. My experience as the Prussians was thrilling, and got better as the game went on ... I had a great time running from the Russians, grinding it out against Austria, chasing the Swedes in circles, punishing the Imperials with Freddy himself, and launching outrageous attacks against the French with the Hanoverians (who came roaring off the ropes after an early quasi-knockout). A remarkable amount of history in this simple little game -- only the fact that it requires three or four players will keep it from being played more (that and the prejudice against it in my local group -- they just can't get past the perceived stuffiness of the theme and that Andy Warhol does Frederick cover). The only problem with this one is that it is MUCH longer than it looks and finding four guys who can play it frequently is pretty much impossible ... combine this with a steep learning curve for the Prussian player and you have a game where whoever plays Prussia seems doomed to be a punching bag the one or two times you get it on the table each year.

RATING: 1.99999
Not a 1 solely due to the application of BGG metrics for determining a "broken" game. It's not broken in the sense that you can actually play it out of the box as is but it otherwise fails almost all my personal requirements for a good game. The components are first rate (as of the second edition) but these are irrelevant to a wargame that otherwise fails to elicit a historical perspective on the situation presented: the concise rules are a tempting invitation to suspend all disbelief in a ludicrous combat system; the draconian effects of the "Cards of Fate" are as unameliorable as they are capriciously and randomly disconnected to any events of the current game in progress; the "Honor System" of allocation of forces is a dangerous and lazy out for any designer attempting to infuse a "Fog of War" aspect; regardless of the length of a battle or composition of forces in any battle the victor never loses a strength point.

So, if I'm loaded with cards of the like suit to the area I currently occupy I can take on all comers, but set one foot across the arbitrarily delineated border into an area for which I'm devoid of like cards and all my powder, shot and combat accumen instantly dissolve? Return to the correct area and they're back? Please.

You're better off with Snakes and Ladders.

RATING: 3
bad, but could be talked into playing it again because it was fun until the Cards of Fate determined the game, and maybe there is something I missed, based on all of the high ratings.

- having geographical zones tied to a card suite to determine a player's relative combat strength is an interesting game mechanic, yet non-sensical with respect to a wargame.

- the Cards of Fate can simply be game breakers; maybe Sweden leaving on the first card, and Russia leaving on the third is unlikely to happen, but it sure wrecks the game for everyone but Prussia.

- the ability to retreat the loser of a battle away from supply is more powerful than actually winning a battle.  when an army 'retreats' five spaces into enemy territory, leaving all hope of supply gone, you are strongly reminded that you are playing a game with no connection to reality.

- Prussia will win unless everyone makes a concerted attack, so the fact that only one player can win is annoying.

most of the above would be okay if the game was under 2 hours; it is actually likely to take 4 or more.

I like this game. 

Playing Prussia you do feel up against it. My view (and the reviews I have read back me up) is that Prussia doesn't have much chance of winning. Prussia is playing for time, hoping that helpful clock of fate cards come up, in particular cards that take opponents out the game ASAP. 

I think the clock of fate cards are perhaps the most critical random element in the game. 

Although the other players are all fighting the Prussians, they are still competing with one another to be the first player to meet their objectives and win the game. They may want to cooperate with each other and coordinate their attacks, but ideally they want Prussia to cave in to their attacks, not those of their allies - an interesting twist.     

The secrecy of your hand together with the secret unit deployment creates a good fog of war effect.

The large, complicated point-to-point map is one of the games most important features. For the Prussian player a big, complicated map can help him evade combat for longer.  

The idea of having 4 different suits of tactical [combat] cards applying in different regions seems strangely quirky and yet the system works very well.

The rules are simple and brief and yet the game has a lot of depth. 

For me the biggest downside is the duration - we couldn't finish it in one evening.

RATING: 7
I liked this game but its not something I will run out and buy.  I already own condottiere, which is what this reminds me of, only its 4 hours long with a much bigger board.  Thats not a bad thing, as the game has a lot of interesting strategic decisions to be made.  Its a card play combat system attached to a very simple wargame framework, and it all works together very well.  Add in variable starting positions and win conditions and you have a really interesting euro-wargame hybrid.  

On the downside, its seems very long and at times the card draws can frustrate, as can the abstractness of the various suits.  The squares on the board that reflect the different suits have nothing to do with the theme, yet they mean everything to the outcome of the battles.  There are also points in the game where the ending is almost predetermined.  I think the balance of the game relies heavily on having an experienced prussian player. 

Overall, this is a very good game I would recommend to wargamers or euro players alike.  If it was 2 hours long instead of 4, it would probably be one of the most popular games on BGG.  Worth playing, probably not worth owning.

Below average: Strategic - 7 years war - Easy (Multiplayer)

Plus:
-Fantsastic gameboard, one of the most bautiful I have ever encountered
-Great strategic manouvring

Minus:
-Battle resolution is innovative, unorthodox. Whatever it represents, it is just not for me (maybe I lack imagination but I really need some relation to supply or production but I can't find it and that makes it really hard for me to enjoy) 
-First Edition: had postcard counters and was not a good thing but for a private publisher my advice is to improve (update: 2nd Edition has counters!)
-Game can take a long time before coming to a conclusion and if coming to conclusion, very abrupt.  
 

I must admit, this game took time for untill I appreciated the mechanisms. Especially the cards as I somehow could not get the link with traditional card games out of my mind. It seemed to simple, too dull...highest card wins. 
HOWEVER, after some time and tries it clicked and I understood it's purpose, and that the card system unites command, logistics, terrain, economics and tactics!

This is an innovative, unique game that shines through innovation, with a deep strategy but only 4 pages of rules.  

The Prussian player is the most fun to play but very challenging compared to the others. The board is the best I have seen.

It is all about manouvring and timing. If you don't have the right cards, move to a sector where you have better cards or avoid battle to accrue the right cards.

Recommended and also check 'Maria' which adds diplomatic twists.

Great game.  Watch the suits of the cards.  As Prussia, don't go balls to the wall in any one battle. Instead lose by one and pull back... slowly.  Wait it out.  Aggressive defense. Don't get in a tit for tat battle.  Keep your cards.

Watch out for your supply depot and keep in mine they will block your retreat and if you can't move in a retreat, you loose the army.

If you are Prussia, for each front, pick a different card suit.

As Allies, watch which cards get chewed up in previous battle and attack on that zone.

Friederich has many things I love in a game: tension, drama, thematic mechanics, spatiality, negotiation, subtle forms of communication, beautiful aesthetics, and more.

Yet, at the same time, I've also played its older sibling Maria which addresses some of the niggly things about Friederich which include:
- cards of fate being so wildly swingy by make the political events player driven instead;
- slow time killing retreats are addressed by giving the victor a point (potentially temporary nonetheless);
- uneven engagement (e.g., France gets a fraction of the time other players do) is addressed by creating three more uniformly sized sides.

This isn't to say that Friederich is a bad game. Rather, it is excellent and ground-breaking; it is simply that Maria manages to do many of these things better. In turn, I think I have a hard time ranking it higher when thinking of inter-game ratings (and using the descriptors as intended).

I have mixed feelings about Friedrich. On the one hand I absolutely love the first 5 turns where you pit your grand strategy against the other players'. When the Fate cards kick in I start to have a big problem with the game, especially if I'm playing France or Russia - I know it's to keep true to the historical events, but it really hurts my enjoyment of the game. Nevertheless it's between 8 and 9 in my ratings.

Played Austria on a 4 player game and ended up winning. Very tense and enjoyable with 2 drawbacks: Russia went out of the game at the first Fate Card and downtime between players sometimes excessive.

Conclusion: Brilliant with 3 players, just ok with 4.

Historically accurate and fun to play is a combination you won't find too often. Here you have it!

RATING: 5
Friedrich is a fundamentally simple and elegant combat system that only works if Prussia's opponents keep each other in check as well as allying against their common enemy. I'm far from convinced that 4 players are really needed here, France and Russia could comfortably be played by the same person. The 'Cards of Fate' also throw in huge amounts of luck. This would have been great if it could have been kept to 2.5 hours, more is just excess.

The theme is awesome and the combat / maneuver mechanics are great. In fact they are so great I don't understand why there is no other game doing it that way (except Maria). But there are some downsides to Friedrich: asymmetric balance (3 vs 1 player) and much randomness due to the event cards (players might suddenly loose control over their armies and thus be deprived of their victory). Someone should make a balanced eurogame out of the mechanics. Otherwise Friedrich stands as a game with a nice experience, but I won't play it regularly.

Preliminary rating. I'd like to play a few more times before I commit to something higher, but I could see it trending up. It seems like the type of game that could dearly use a dedicated group, since collusion in the game looks very bizarre.

This really does need to be tried.  The rules are reasonably simple but the play is pretty engaging.  The cards of fate don't seem to add a lot, but there's enough there before them.

The tactical card play is really a great system.  It's not complicated, but it allows for a lot of meaningful decisions during each combat.

Also, the asymmetrical sides do seem to be fairly balanced.  At least, balanced in chances to win, not balanced in play time.  France was rather boring in comparison to some of the others.

This is an unusual game.  I've played with both 3 and 4 players, and I think 4 players may be the optimum number.  The combat system is very odd, but once you get used to it, there are a lot of interesting decisions to be made. I think this game is accessible to eurogamers wishing to try a wargame.  One complaint is that there are no markers included in the game for marking conquered cities.  This seems like a major oversight to me considering victory is determined by conquering specified objective cities.  Writing this information down is suggested in the rules.  No thank you... give me some counters for that.

RATING: 8
Friedrich offers an unusual, if not unique approach, to simulating a historical conflict. In some ways it is similar to many typical wargames - particularly in the movement of armies on the map and the existence of supply rules. But the way that the cards are used - replacing such wargaming standards as terrain modifiers and rolling dice to represent many of the factors affecting the outcome of a battle - is truly innovative. Unlike Wallenstein/Shogun, Friedrich is not a Eurogame with a vaguely militaristic theme. It is a wargame that abtracts elements of war in a different way to other wargames. By replacing dice with cards, Friedrich reduces the element of randomness in determining the result of battle. Unfortunately the Clock of Fate Cards introduce a large dose of luck at the strategic level. Although I applaud the design of Friedrich, my experience so far (a 2-player and a 4-player game) has been disappointing. It seems that the draw of the Fate Cards can make the already difficult task facing Prussia almost impossible, while the French player can suffer from boredom with few decisions to make and a lot of time spent waiting while the other players cogitate. UPDATE: a couple of 3-player games were more promising though I still find that, unless you are playing the Prussians, you can spend a lot of time waiting for the other players to make decisions. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Friedrich is a fun game with medium complexity. The theme feels strong in Friedrich and premotes some roleplaying. I feel you can have a pretty laid backed attitude towards your countries which promotes a relaxed gameplay even though you are faced against the other players. The only downside is the game length with new players around the table it can take quite some time to finish up.

RATING: 7.5
This board game reminds me of a war game in a lot of regards, but the combat in the game was my favorite aspect.  There are standard playing card suit grids on the map and in combat, you can only play cards from your hand that matches the grid you are currently in.  The only luck in the game comes from the fact that you may not draw combat cards in the suits that you need.

In the game, Prussia appeared to be the hardest to play since they are constantly in a holding pattern and trying to survive to draw out the deck.  If Prussia doesn't send a sizeable force against France though, the French can quickly win.

This is a fantastic game! I've played once so far as the Prussians and enjoyed it very much despite losing in about the 17th turn. The game play is very simple especially if you've ever played even the simplist wargame before, then the concepts will be familiar. The only downside can be the very large swing in gameplay time.  The fellow who taught us the game had played only once before at it took only 1.25 hours for them the crush the Prussians.  We started the game at 9pm figuring on about a 2 hour game as our game days usually end at 11pm. We finished at 2am...

Beautiful map, nice bits and cards too. The play is fluid. It's fun planning strategically and tactically around the luck of the draw. Resource maintenance is pretty simple to handle. --------   Way too much downtime if you're playing only one of the minors, especially France.  But one person playing multiple minors would remove the race towards their objectives. That player wouldn't care which of his countries made it, as long as one did. I don't see a good solution. --------- Maybe play simultaneous games?

Fantastic game, one of my favourites.

Rich mixture of strategy (hand management, decisions about where to attack, where to hold and where to fall back) and tactics (can I take out that supply train? Should I bluff in Hearts?)

Players need to accept that luck (as manifested in the order in which the cards are drawn from the fate deck) will influence (although not necessarly determine) which player will win - acknowledge this and play accordingly!

Can play long with good Prussian play if the cards of fate allow.

Stunning game in almost all respects. The rules are a scant 6 pages or so, and most people could grasp all the core concepts inside of 2 turns. The components and presentation are of a very high standard. 

Despite the fact that combat is resolved using essentially a standard deck of cards, I found that Friedrich easily feels like a proper wargame. The use of supply trains and the clever nuances of how objectives are controlled all work together so well. 

I've now played once as Prussia--boy is that tough! The 7 cards per turn is nice, until all the allies find their feet and start picking at you on all fronts. I tried to inflict a couple of early defeats to slow down their progress (and succeeded in the case of Sweden, who were rendered a non-factor). But in the mid-game I started taking a lot of 1 army defeats on purpose to conserve my cards. If the Deck of Fate goes your way, Russia can drop out and give you more resources to defend against Austria and France. 

I'd jump at the next opportunity to play. Highly recommended.

A fine maneuver warfare game. Beautiful map with enough room for maneuver. Clever supply model. The map and pieces are very  ergonomic. The combat system breaks my immersion, though, and is too "brain-burny" (card-counting) for my taste. 

Prussia seems an order of magnitude harder to play than the other powers.

I really enjoyed that when playing Friedrich, all sides (with the exception of Austria) have it up against them to win the game, but I was Russia/Sweden in the game. After spending 2 hours building up a strategy to win the game, with both Russia and Sweden, a randomly drawn event card obliterated both of my armies in two subsequent turns.

Although this happened, I then took over the Empire, who thanks to Austria's two hours of planning and strategy building, had already won the game.

I really enjoyed the game, but winning conditions are just too random. It may have well been, pick a random card 1-10, highest card wins.

Not recommended if you don't like random, luck based cards to scupper your plans.

This could be the wargame I was looking for. Enough Euro gameplay-wise, enough conflict wargame-wise, elegant rules and multiplayer. The chaos and kingmaker factor of multiplayer games is to a great extent channeled by the fixed factions.

Excellent 4-player war/euro hybrid covering the 7-Years War. The 3 on 1 dynamic is great because the 3 "allies" are competing to conquer their objectives first. Prussia is so strong in the early game that you don't want to be the first ally to get in a tussle. However, it could end up being an advantage if Prussia stops paying attention to you after an early smack-down. The tactical card system is a good, new mechanic. I can't rate this higher than a 8 just because of the game length. If only this could play in 2 hours it woud be a huge hit. Nonetheless, this is a great innovative game about a very engaging topic.

She's a beaut - map locations are a bit small and the stickers are fiddly, but overall the physical quality is outstanding.  The combat system is a little goofy at first blush but once you have the gist of it the possibilities gel and plans begin to form.  The game-end mechanic adds a great deal of tension without being oppressive, though the occasional early-exiting Russian may whinge.  A very rewarding gaming experience, coming in alongside Struggle of Empires to make this a fine time to enjoy multiplayer wargaming.

The first time I played this, I was Austria. I started out too aggressively, lost most of my army, demolished (parts of) the Prussians', and essentially handed the game to the third player. I know it's unfair to let my own incompetence color my opinion of this game, but I have to admit a little suspicion of any game that bears so few mistakes. It seems a little fussy, what with the intricacy of the movement webbing on the board. There are dynamics to movement that I suspect you don't really get until the third or fourth play, but am I interested? 

The card system is ingenious, though, and it's easy to underestimate how important it is to play to your strong suits - just as it's easy to underestimate how powerful it makes you to have a strong suit in the first place. I'll give it another try in a year or two.

I do not like the war theme for this. Main reason is that this game does not have anything to do with war. Everything hapening here is miles and miles away from real war choices.

Very fun, simple multi-player game.  Playing in the Friedrich hot-seat was one of the most intense gaming experiences I've had.  I particularly liked the bluffing aspect of holding loads of crap cards as a means of intimidating my opponents with my "mighty armies".  Minimal communication is a must between the opposing forces in order to get the very nice feel of "delayed opportunism" as players react to the battle outcomes of their "allies".  The Hand of Fate cards place every player's neck in a noose from the start.  It's all absolutely brilliant design-for-effect stuff.

It's only weakness is its lengthy time requirements, which can be from three to nearly five hours depending on the nature of the players and the luck of the Hand of Fate draws.  Such time requirements are fine for me if there is a bit more history involved, but that would probably require more of a traditional CDG design and be just a fraction as satisfying.

Interesting asymmetrical wargame: all against one, but nevertheless only one of the allies can win. Coalition warfare is subtle, but necessary! The importance of supply adds a crucial element of warfare often neglected in simulations. Combat is resolved via a neat and original card mechanism. Although there are no dice, the outcome of the game is determined by a large amount of luck. The Cards of Fate have a huge impact on the flow of the game (actually only true for the ones that knock out complete nations), resulting in a race against time for the allies. Probably better with three players. Minor point: a game lasts a very long time.

Beautiful board and nice colorful components.  Gives a great feel for Friedrich's running back and forth to head off enemies.  The playing card mechanism was a gutsy design choice and seems to work well.  A flawed end of game mechanism drags out the endgame too long but does not ruin the experience.  Not a game for a light evening of fun, but definitely a good heavy.

RATING: 4.5
Friedrich is one of the bigger gaming dissapointments for me. I really expected to love this, all of the mechanics sound great in theory and the components are stunning, but when it came to playing it I just couldn't wait for it to end. 
 
I think the problems are that its much too long for something so simple, theres too much downtime and its too hard to make and hold significant gains due to the small amount of armies vs space on the board. 

I've only played one game thus far but the other players all felt the same way. We were all happy to have Sweden suddenly win on a random card draw and end it.

For a game of this type I'd much rather just play Axis and Allies.

Friedrich has numerous flaws which make me wonder how it can have such an incredibly high rating.

The game relies heavily on luck of the draw: some cards are flat out better than others and not by a small margin, difference between drawing something like 2 or 12 isn't exactly tiny. And not only that, you need to get the right suit to do anything.

Other players against Preussia is a fun concept on paper, but fails in practice: defeating Preussia needs co-operation between its enemies, but since only one player can win, there is no incentive to do it. Preussia also gets a lot of cards, which can (with some luck) lead to very game-y strategies, like hording massive numbers of cards in one suit and winning the game by mostly waiting it out in areas where that suit is needed - nobody can mount a real offensive, as they can't get the cards they'd need.

Considering this content Friedrich is much too long for what it is. If it lasted 30 minutes it would be a fun filler, but over 3 hours? Urgh.

Four is being generous, but I still like the core idea: a fun card battle system bolted on an interesting historic scenario.

Which is such a shame, because it has some really neat mechanics.

Annoying experience - especially those times, when you've to play role of Friedrich. It's just taking your positions and wait... wait... and wait. And because the game takes 3 hours you get bored... VERY bored. I see, that other roles are a bit more interesting, but still one has to suffer and that's not nice or fun.

[Original] Friedrich is a unique wargame encompassing the Seven Years' War. This 3- or 4-player game pits one player (controlling 2 of 7 nations: Prussia and Hanover) against the other players (who control the remaining 5 nations, or the Allies). The Prussian/Hanoverian player's goal--playing the part of Frederick the Great (Friedrich der Grosse)--is simple: survive, while his opponents withdraw from the conflict one-by-one. Frederick's opponents attempt to win the game by capturing and holding onto key cities (with each Allied nation having a different set of key cities to conquer).

The game combines an area control-like mechanic (where the position of the playing pieces is incredibly important) with disciplined hand management. Battles are resolved by playing cards of a specific suit (spades, clubs, hearts, and diamonds) which requires bluffing as well as subtle card play.

Like many games, Friedrich includes a built-in timer mechanic (so that the game has a definite end) in the form of event cards, called the Cards of Fate. These simulate historical events without pigeonholing the players into a series of uninspiring game turns. The Cards of Fate may help or hinder, including some which actually eliminate nations from the game. (Note, however, that although nations are eliminated from the game, at no time are players eliminated; this is achieved by re-assigning Allied nations amongst the players opposing Prussia/Hanover.)

The game plays well again-and-again with each outcome unique. (The game's designer also penned two 2-player scenarios.) When you play Friedrich will the Cards of Fate be with you... or against you? Only time will tell.

[2006.Dec.14] In the final stages of playtesting a Cyberboard game box that I designed for Friedrich, and I still enjoy playing the game. That's a good sign!

[2007.Jan.21] Note, if played with AP-prone gamers, the length of this game can quickly grow too long.

Probably the best 'war game' I've played in many years.  The game is literally simple to say the least.  The strategy however, is extremely intense.  There is an element of bluffing involved, as you never know what the enemy is going to do.  No dice needed, this is a 'pure game'.  The combat works with suites of cards, which are drawn from shoes.  Everyone has an equal chance of receiving cards.  There's a strong sense you're playing poker warfare at times.  The pieces, the map, the layout is done right.  Someone obviously spent a LOT of time putting this system together.  I wish there was more than one scenario to play, but it'll take forever to master just this one.

The game board and tactics and awareness of card play (of the Friedrich player mostly) are keys to doing well and lasting towards the end of the game.  It seems very difficult for Friedrich to achieve victory.  I'm also worried about the possible kingmaker factor in future games.

This is another fine hybrid Euro-War game that blends aspects of each genre nicely.  There is a surprising amount of historical detail presented in a game that also boasts the elegant mechanics of a typical Euro.  The playing time is likewise a compromise. Unfortunately this will not hit the table as often as it should for me.

RATING: 7
Strategic scale 7 Years War + multiplayers + Coloful circle chess = one of the highly acclaimed Euro-ish game, with history. Some of the rules are a bit gamey e.g. the cards suit directing your armies dominant theatre of operations and some event cards are too powerful to force a player to quit.  On the other hand, the game did portray the Prussians fighting an "interior" war against all sides.  Leadership, however, has no effect on the game, somewhat contrary to what I have read and played about the Seven Years War before.  The map is sufficiently detailed and large to cover the heart of Europe where the struggle was conducted.  Supply is handled quite elegantly where you can trace your units' supply either to a depot or a supply train, which moves at a slightly slower rate than the armies.  Armies are allocated by the players initially and may be reinforced.  The Tactical Cards (the suit) are used to reslove the battles. There is no zone of control in the game but battle occurs when opposing armies are adjacent to each other.  The armies' strengths of both sides are compared, adjusted by the cards of the right suit of the area where the battle location takes place.  The one with the higher 'adjusted' strength wins and the differential would be the number of dots to retreat and the number of losses inflicted.

With four experienced players, this game really shines. New players should never play Prussia (unless everyone's a new player). [2009-12-14]

Edit: [2012-01-25] Just received the new Jubilee Edition map in the mail. It looks really nice. The only significant change I noticed is the suits in the left hand "column" of the map have changed to club-hearts-club-hearts from what it was before. And one town name change.

A perfect 6 rating game. It's fun and different game. A little long and lot's of luck seems to be a factor. But good strategy can pay off! I would prefer a hand limit of 10 or so that would force some more fighting especially between austria and prussia.

after first play (4 players, i play Austria) : very interesting and even light weuro (wargame - eurogame)

RATING: 9
In midst of first play. Rules are pretty straightforward but there is a lot of strategy. 

At first blush the use of cards to respolve combat (yes, the 4 suits we are all used to; tweaked slightly) tied to rectangular areas of the board hits as weird but it works. The fog of war is not in how many many men you have but in how you use them. I think the cards capture that nicely.

There is also - especially if you are Prussia - maneuvering to defend objective cities while avoiding combat. 

The only thing that is a bit annoying is the fact that the numbers on the General units are a bit small. Also, we have been using colored glass stones to track conquered cities rather than the tiny national labels.

We haven't hit the Clock of Fate cards yet and I expect surprises. But that is like in real life. Richard Sivel warns that the game can have abrupt turns.

Am looking forward to playing this quite a bit now that I've finally gotten into it.

Components: Excellent. Mapboard is top notch and sits FLAT. (Only thing is Prussia looks like the sea...)
Rules: Short and pretty clear. There is a FAQ posted on BGG. Examples in the rules could have been better.
Gameplay: Excellent - a lot of strategies to consider. Bluffing due to cards you hold or wnat your opponents to think you hold. Position - one must always be mindful of your units - Generals and Supply Trains - or risk disaster.
Replay: Should be excellent as an endless number of approaches can be taken to play the game. Balance appears to be pretty good (with Fate cards upsetting the cart in mid to late game).

Update:
Having played through two games - losing as Prussia both times. The rating is solid. Oddly both games - with completely different players - played along the same lines but I think that is a fluke.

I think playing with 4 is best as the "Allies" have to look out for themselves.

This game (is way more fun than a bag of) rocks!  Lots of tactics and maneuver and interplay between the cards and sectors.  Great assymetrical yet balanced play.  Prussia is the hardest for our group to play by far--no wins yet.  You just can't seem to afford to win too many battles as Prussia.  Counting to three was never so difficult.  Game length is the only problem--the game play is so compelling that you don't notice the hours fly by while playing, though.  Just make sure you have enough time set aside to finish.

The length of a wargame but the history of a Euro.  Wouldn't mind the mechanisms and certainly agree that the game has interest as a strategy game if I ignore the historically bizarritude of the card play, but why should I have to go to the effort.

I really like the unique combat system and the point-to-point movement. As discussed with Ben, this would make a cool American Civil War game (Eastern Theater). Playing Friedrich is very challenging.

[UPDATE] - My friends love this game and I respect that. It's just not my cup of tea. I have no interest in playing this game again. My biggest beef is the downtime between turns. When I play a 4-hour game, I want to feel engaged the whole time.

[UPDATE - Feb - 2018] - After a long hiatus, I decided to give this game another go. The result: I raised my rating from a “3” to a “6.” I enjoyed the experience. I loved the dance and maneuver for position. I had a better understanding of the history.

That said, I still have problems with the game. First, I’ll say that three players is a sweet spot, mitigating the downtime and lack of engagement that bothered me in previous plays. I read a strategy guide before the game which helped me understand the stages and flow of the game—and that helped me understand the “give and take” of the system.

What struck me, after this latest play, is my disconnect between the level of abstraction in the game design and how it clashes with the richly detailed map of Central Europe. While I think the use of playing cards in the combat system is clever, I balk at the idea that I can’t attack a region because my “heart cannons” are sitting on a factory floor in Moscow or my troops haven’t been equipped with latest “spade rifles.” 

I also think the retreat rules are absurd from a military perspective.  Unless I have been outmaneuvered into a situation where I cannot retreat, the choice of retreat route should always be the decision of the losing general. What general in their right mind would retreat 4 spaces AWAY from their supply train? It just doesn’t make sense to me. 

Finally, the game is way too long for me. We played for 5 hours and were probably only 80 percent through the game before we called it. I was deeply engaged in the game and wanted to see it to the end. I’m sure experienced players could get it down to 3 or 4 hours. To do that, you would really have to have a passion for the game.

I would play this again, which is an improvement over my previous declaration of “I’m done.” It’s a good “special evening” game and when I come to peace with the abstractions and enjoy it for what it is...then it’s all good.

RATING: 7
7: An amazingly challenging and rewarding game. Beautiful board, pieces and cards as well as simple but clever mechanics make this a really good 3-4 player wargame. It can get a little long, though if Friedrich is holding his own and the Cards of Fate don't kick out the others quickly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Let me be clear, this is not a bad game for some people, but it is a bad game for me.  

The combination of game length, lots of downtime (for the non-Prussian players), and the randomness of the cards and events makes for an unpalatable gaming experience for me.  

In particular, the fact that the cards dictate where you can effectively battle, but the board dictates where you need to battle to be able to win makes for a miserable experience when you get unlucky draws.  

For example, as France my first few battles with Hannover were in the suit of clubs.  Hannover was drawing 2 cards a turn and on the first turn they were a 12 and an 8 of culbs.  I was drawing 4-1 cards and in my first set the only "clubs" card I had was a reserve.  On the next turn I tried again, expecting Hannover to not have clubs and Hannover produced the 10 of clubs.  I drew... no clubs until turn 3, when I drew the 4... and Hannover still had something better.  

The card play aspect reminds me of Taj Mahal, which I also do not care for, for similar reasons.

Also I am not sure how many different options there will be for Prussians. Time will tell on this. I will try this one again. 

Updated to a 7 after watching others play this one. I will need ot play it again myself but I see this going up. 

After the 2nd play it stays a 7

Updated to an 8. Really a great light war game.

My rating of 9 is after 3.5 games (my first game went about 5 turns before we had to call it).  A slim set of rules makes this an easy-to-teach game, but preserves the desperation one can imagine that Frederick the Great felt in the 7 Years War.  The tactical card mechanic gives a good approximation of the problem of having to defend all around, and the fate cards give the allies, as well, a timetable that they must win by (though they don't know what it is!).  I'm enjoying this game more and more as I play.  There's a lot of space on the map, and the game rewards careful, and often bold, maneuvers, as armies can get cut off from their supply trains (or the armies avoided and the supply trains themselves destroyed), or entire armies themselves can sometimes be trapped and destroyed by smaller armies.

An excellent game.  I'm ready to play any time.

RATING: 3
Wonderfully innovative game.  Friedrich has simple rules and very interesting gameplay.  I think that the mechanics are really as brilliant as everyone says.  You can find plenty of comments here touting the virtues of this game (the clever use of cards, the maneuvering rules, the historic backdrop) and I agree with all of them.  However, not much is said about its flaws.

There are some downsides to this game that people should consider though: 

Game length - The game can last over 5 hours if Prussia hangs in there.  Just be ready for the time commitment.

No enforceability - Many of the rules require everyone to manage their hand and their armies without any verification.  This can be a problem due to factors ranging from cheating to innocent mistakes.

Luck of the draw - The endgame is filled with tight struggles between players, while the game will randomly pick a winner based on the Cards of Fate drawn.  Once the Cards of Fate are shuffled and placed on the table at the start of the game, each player's probability of winning becomes highly skewed.  Make what you will of this.

Leader bashing - One aggressive player can unbalance the strength of the other nations.  If prolonged battles occur between two nations, they are both very likely to have no chance against the other nations that are laying low and conserving strength.  Warn new players that they could be handing the game to another player if they go at it too hard.

I do like this game and I hope it influences future designs.  I just think that there should be some awareness of a few of its negative aspects.

Update: After 4 plays, the flaws, mentioned above, make playing Friedrich a waste of my gaming time.  My rating reflects my desire to play again.

RATING: 8
Rating based on 3 & 4 players.

Fantastic game. It has all my favourite bits from Maria (the maneuvering, the back-and-forth battles using tactic cards) while removing the more complex rules, making it a smooth-to-play and easy-to-learn game. While I'd say Maria is probably the objectively *deeper* game as it incorporates the political tracks and negotiation (and I do like it more), Friedrich more of a "fight-n-fight" kind of game that is just straightforwardly fun. 

The Cards of Fate mechanic that can eliminate entire countries with one blow would be irksome to some, but I found that it added a nice bit of tension, and long as you know the possibility is there, you can adjust your plans accordingly. However, it does lead to a situation where the length of the game can vary greatly, and this is already a long game (especially as Prussia's win condition is to hold out until you get victory by default). The game doesn't *feel* as long as it actually takes, though how much you have to do depends on your country. Taking over the Imperial Army does feel a bit weird, and there is a possibility that is the only army you control for many turns, which would be kind of boring.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It works fine but isn't all that much fun due to the fact that it's difficult for the non-prussian players to screw each other over.  In fact if any of them want to stand a chance of winning they have to co-operate.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The whole design of the game seemed really well thought out and throughly playtested, however despite its novelty, the underlying mechanic just fell a little flat for me. The depth of strategy available is far less than it should be for a game of this length. I think it could be greatly improved by allowing for even just a bit more tactical play; setting up pincer attacks, terrain effects, etc.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A very interesting and absorbing asymmetrical game which appears to offer everything. There's some drama with the abstract combat system, some real brain-burning strategy, some history worked in nicely from the cards of fate and some light negotiation with an unusual twist from the "allied against Prussia" setup. Oh, and the components are fantastic. On the downside I've found it a surprisingly dry experience given all of the above and the "switch nations" mechanic offered as a sop to player-elimination haters is intensely annoying as you're taking over a position another player might have worked hard to achieve - or neglected. But these are minor quibbles - if you can find three hours to play a game, you'll surely find something here to engage you.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very strange game. Takes a while to figure out how to work with the odd definition of 'control' in the game. Very much a game of maneuver. Beautiful components and probably accessible to people unfamiliar with wargames. This is a 10 if you're playing Prussia, but probably only a 7 if you're playing one of the other powers.

The assimetry of the game (everybody against Prussia) that captures the historical need for Friedrich to be here and there in 5 fronts at the same time, the historical impact of the event cards and the sense of humor behind some of them are the main strong points of the game. Nevertheless, the battle card driven system is too abstract and the game loose at this point the historical flavour that one may expect.

Not taken with it after 1 4-player game. Too much in the way of luck, problems with downtime, and with the amount of gametime that some of the players get. (France gets very little to do per turn, Russia/Sweden not far behind). Might be interesed in trying it 3-player.

The card combat system is novel, but ultimately fails. If you draw low, you lose. If you don't draw the right suits, you can't even fight. Victory goes to the player who draws high in the right suits at the right time. And then there's the random event cards. So France can draw garbage combat cards, have almost zero input into the game and get knocked out on the first 2 event cards draws. And have spent 2-3 hours at the game table. Yay! Great game experience. This should be a 2-player, or at most 3-player, game.

A pretty interesting game.  This is one of my favorite conflicts so I'm interested in its different portrayals.  Friedrich has some mechanics that make it a bit more of a hand management game.  The rules are fairly simple and I like the mechanics and the general game flow, but it just doesn't evoke the period enough for me.  I have been playing a lot of Clash of Monarchs lately and this game just pales in comparison.

02/08/09 Played a four-player incomplete (3.3 hour) game. I enjoyed the game and look forward to playing it again. Though it took a lot longer than we thought it would. The only quibble I had with the game is the lines dividing the suit sectors are sort of hard to see. Their dark blue lines kind of blend in with the black lines of the road network (and where the board folds). I think they should have used red or some other bright color to delineate the suit zones.  
01/09/10 Played another four-player game. We quit after 5 hours and 16 turns. It could have gone 3 more turns, per the Fate deck. I like the game but its quite taxing. So I can't take it more than once a year. 
05/28/16 Played a four-player game in 4 hrs & 34 mins in 8 turns. I won as France. In my two previous games Prussia never came close to losing.  Today between turns 5 and 8 Prussia lost 6 of its 8 armies and its ally Hannover lost both of its armies. This was the first time I'd seen Prussia implode. In my fist two games they never lost an army and were unstoppable.

The presentation of the game,especially mapboard and tactical cards,is first rate. The game system is simple and clever,with only minor bookkeeping required,and good fog of war.One mechanic I really like is that the tactical combat cards are used for both adding to an army's combat strength,and also for purchasing replacements. I do wish the generals ratings influenced combat or movement in some way,although I suppose players can experiment with optional rules on this,if they so desire. This game is a treat,since it's so easy to explain to casual gamers,and,despite this,the gameplay isn't simplistic. One of the better games of recent years.

A solid game; the card mechanic really surprised me.  In fact, the whole game surprised me, and what a fun chess match it is.  I have no idea how to win as Prussia, but fun to play them.  The event mechanism great.  Nothing but praise for this title.  Further play has only strengthened my rating.  So much game, unique, and with only a few pages of rules.  Obviously extensively playtested as well.  Wow.

Very clever systems - particularly the Cards of Fate and the technique for determining conquering of objectives.

Beautifully produced with simpler rules than I expected.

I imagine it would play best with an experienced player playing the Prussians.

Cards of Fate add a nice randomising element, but also can make life excessively hard for the Prussians (especially if all the opponents stay in play and the Prussians lose their card advantage).

"The" missing link between Euro & War games.  When I first heard that battles were basically fought with a deck of playing cards I thought, this is going to be lame; the card mechanism works great.  I love: the theme of the game, the elegant tactics & strategies involved; the fact that you need to learn how & when to retreat; the supply mechanism; the defense rules; the beautiful game board & components.  I also rather like the cards of fate (clock) and their "historic" impact on gameplay although they can be very frustrating.  Each player has their own winning conditions so this one doesn't get bogged down with negotiations.

Need to actually play this opposed. The Prussian player seems to want to assign a certain suit to each opponent and hold a corresponding sector containing that opponent's objectives. To defeat this, the allies must gang up on these sectors so that their combined strength can drain the Prussian cards in that suit. But of course, since there's only one winner, the Allies may not cooperate perfectly. That seems to be the crux of the game, though of course there's lots of tactical nuance in the maneuvering.

Great game! The map looks beautiful and the game design is brilliant. The rules are very easy and short. Everyone can win, even the small swedish army or the imperial one. Friedrich is surrounded, the prussians are just trying to survive (Friedrich player has to be extremly careful with his hand cards, even when it seems as he has the total card superiority).

From a first play.  Man, is this fun!  It was longer than we expected, and yes, it can drag, but I had a fun time all the way through (playing Herr F himself!)  It's primarily a game of maneuver and canny tactics.  Reminds me of Fortress America, but with a lot more thought involved and replay value.  Can't wait to play again!

The game is a bit of a time commitment (it's no Diplomacy or Advanced Civ, but a hard-fought game where Prussia holds on for 20+ turns can go 5-6 hours), but it's also provided some of the most intense gaming experiences I've had recently.

Playing Prussia is not for the faint of heart.

Also, for some reason the game strikes me, more than any other I've played, as something that would have fit right into _The Player of Games_.

Simulating the Seven years war in 1756, Russia, France and Austria attmept to battle Prussia for supremecy. A nation wins by taking all their objectives, Prussia wins by preventing the other 3 nations from taking their objectives. Battles are fought with cards from a standard 52 card deck using suits depending on the region of the map you are in. Otherwise, almost like a war game, with very simple rules. Good game, I would play this again.

3-4 players  

Better than Maria? (Maria plays only 2-3 players)

[i]Defeat Prussia before the Tsarina dies! Or be Frederick the Great and struggle for survival with a mixture of courageous willpower, sudden inspiration and stoic patience.

It is the summer of 1756. On the eve of the Seven Years War, half of Europe has formed an alliance. Frederick the Great is in deep sorrow: Is the annihilation of Prussia planned? Is it Prussia's defeat or is it Prussia's glory?

All against one – but only one will reign supreme. On a map of Old Europe, players maneuver their generals from city to city. Frederick must retain a part of each Prussian province, while the attacking powers savagely seek out their objectives. The clever use of tactical cards is decisive to winning.

Histogame and Richard Sivél present Friedrich as a novel concept uniting the fascination of board and card games. Accurately based on history while maintaining a slim set of rules, Friedrich offers wide open spaces for chess-like moves and great depth for decision making. Taken into Frederick's era, you will reflect on tactical finesses, smile about interspersed anecdotes, and be perplexed at how often you are not able to count to three...

Note: A common misconception is that Friedrich has player elimination based on the cards of fate making countries leave the game. The game does not have player elimination; it has country elimination, and a player could end up controlling fewer countries than they started with, but players are never eliminated by the cards of fate.[/i]

Such a simple structure, yet the game feels really rich both in abstract-problem-solving aspect and historical-flavour aspect. Before my first game, I always assumed that Prussia will have a hell of hard time - but the ability to draw 7 cards makes Prussian player virtually invincible in battles unless other players carefully organise an attempt to bleed him. All in all, very highly recommended.

Wonderful game. You can feel the love and the time the author dedicated to it. Very easy rules. Incredibly deep in play (without being tiring). Fun. Tense till the end. A feast for people that, like me, prefer strategy over tactics. A game in which you, the gamer, are in control. A game in which you, the gamer, can choose your personal way to victory. A game that reaches this without using a complicated set of rules, and let you concentrate on the game and the strategy instead. In two words: highly recommended (only warning: it is quite long).

UPDATE
It doesn't scores higher because of the too powerful effect of the  fate cards (a kind of luck deciding who wins, but at least not deciding the way people play). Also a bit too long, especially considering that the players not playing Prussia (particularly the French player) have sometimes to wait a bit too long. Both problems are supposed to be solved by Maria, a game that hopefully  I am going to try soon.

This is a wargame I want to like more than I actually do. The gameplay is surprisingly light and the rules do not get in the way. There is space for different strategies and tactics. That is good too. There is, however, a lot of downtime and I have a feeling the game takes too long to play for what it is. Unfortunately all players are not constantly involved in the conflict. Sometimes you just sit waiting and collect cards, which is dull. In other words, this game drags a bit. I would love it if it would play in about 3 hours. Furthermore, now that Maria is out, I just play that instead.

I would like to try the new edition (Jubiläumsedition)!

Just the 1 playing where I played a very conservative Prussia, but I just couldn't hold off everyone at once when the howling hounds at the door got organised. It seems to me there's too much luck, first whether you pick 13's or 1's as your fight cards (huge range) and then huge luck on whether the game finishes early (Prussia wins) or later (Prussia loses). But it was interesting to play.

Easily one of the best board games created by a designer. I have never experienced such perfect merging of theme and mechanics. Richard Sivèl picked up every intricate detail of the Seven Years War and the spirit of 18th century warfare (and mentality) and stylized it into a simple and elegant, yet complex, gameplay. I find myself divided between wanting to play the game or simply stare and admire the monument that it is.

It's rare that a game does a great job of capturing the flavor of a period with great fidelity that's a successful translation into a set of mechanics.  This is one of those games.  As the Prussians, you're going to feel like you're always running from fire to fire with a bucket that you hope is large enough to extinguish the flames.  As the other players, you'll be hoping that your flame isn't the one that gets focused on or that the flamethrower that you've brought is enough to overwhelm the bucket brigade.

If the game has a flaw, it's in the event cards that you're going to start drawing.  If the Prussians don't go for the "knockout blow" of Austria then the specific sequence of events will have a great deal more to do with who wins and when than the strategy of the players.  If you're the Austrians and happen to get knocked out, then it's "Oh Well," even if you're one objective away from winning.

That element is frustrating sometimes, but does add significantly to the dynamic tension of the game by giving you a reason to risk not having the right size flamethrower to overwhelm the Prussians.

A very, very interesting and dynamic game with some fantastic mechanics.

It took me a while to get round to playing this game after picking it up at Essen. Should have tried earlier. 

The multi-player game is a race to take down the Prussians, which is one of those good news / bad news things. The Prussian player can only win if he stops everyone, so he is motivated to balance the game, but if he gets it wrong on one front (as happens in our game) the other players are shafted, probably through no fault of their own.

2 games of this so far and each time its just as tense and enjoyable. I played the Prussians and throughout the entire game I can feel the stress of fighting(defending?) on all four fronts and thats the kinda of game that I like. Granted there maybe be a lot of downtime especially when it is the Prussian's turn but that is understandable as it is literally 1 against 3 others. 

This game relies on the strategic outcome via movement and combat with the former, in my opinion, being more important. Battles should be chosen carefully and retreating is always an acceptable option.

This multiplayer wargame solves the "multiplayer wargame problem" (Player A attacking Player B helps Player C) in an innovative way.  Basically, each player must capture certain cities belonging to Frederick, while the Frederick player must survive until a certain point without that happening.  While the non-Frederick players are "allies", they are really competitors and cannot interact in any meaningful way.  The Frederick player must carefully manage his resources (in the form of cards), as spending too many against one player might mean a shortage against another.  My major complaints are that random events at the end determine when Frederick wins, which can cause huge playtime variations in a very long game.  Additionally, Frederick has a lot more to do than other players; playing as one of the allies may not be as interesting.

After first play, very positive impressions.  Great four-handed wargame.  It learns fairly quickly, and even the quirks are fairly rapidly assimilated.

In fact, rarely have mechanics and theme so effectively melded in a wargame.

This rating is for the 4-player game. Playing the french is a most boring experience. You need 20 seconds for your turn and then you can fall asleep for 20 minutes. The fact that russia can be kicked out very early (the remaining game will then be as agonizingly boring as the french game) doesn't help the rating.

From game mechanics I think this could be a good 2-player game. I don't know if balance allows this game to be a played by two players (the Allied side played by one side should be  much easier due to better sync), but that could help the rating at least two or three points.

I enjoyed my first game very much, especially since I won! (as Austria & the Imperial Army).

Straight forward rules with lots of strategy. Even though the players are three against one, it is not a cooperative game and each force is separate with its own separate objectives. The game seems balanced and I don't believe the drawing of cards mechanism introduces too much luck. Although, the smaller forces (such as the Imperial Army, which gets only one card per turn,) may be more affected by the cards drawn, however this is still balanced by the ability to use the cards of the wrong suits to increase the number of your armies.  Overall a great game and fun to play.

[floatleft][ImageID=82656][/floatleft][floatright][ImageID=590714][/floatright]Friedrich is an excellent, simple, elegant, multiplayer wargame. One player assumes the role of Friedrich, leader of Prussia, while the other players are pitted against Prussia trying to complete individual objectives for victory. Combat is handle by a clever auction of sorts where players must match suit to specific locations on the board. I am not really fan of the "random" events that occur.

Wonderful and refreshing take on war games.  Have only played a couple games with people I have previously taught; most have been with first-timers.  Thus, the game tends to get over-analyzed by new players and gets bogged down at certain points.  This would not be a problem had all players had a fair balance of choices, but due to the asymmetrical play of the countries, France has little to think about while Prussia, Russia, and Austria duke it out.

Despite these complaints, I have a ton of fun with the game and it is a breath of fresh air in the dice-cluttered typical war game genre.  When players figure out how the system works and pull off that one genius move, they realize that maybe Risk or A&A isn't the end-all to war gaming--which as most should know is one of the biggest hurdles in introducing players to 'serious' games.

The ease of the system and the sheer variety of gameplay(each game I have played has ended up drastically different in flow and structure) makes this one game I'm almost always willing to play.

RATING: 5
The game has a novel playing card mechanic for resolving battles and a map which absorbs all the movement complexity and makes it very approachable. However, this game suffers from far too much down time and the non-prussion players are far to dependent on each other to have a chance to win. No interaction within the structure of the game. I've given it a few plays but now it's time to move on.

RATING: 7
Three 3-player games. Had great fun even though one is somewhat at the mercy of the cards. Prussia may have the VERY much harder game to play with the strong possibility that his loss will put him in a kingmaker position every game. It's also possible that the other players don't have a lot of variation in what they can do so, in some sense, they might be doing the job of 'simple computer AI'. Hoping to play this again real soon.

A little bit too long for what it is - especially the battles can drag (because of constant calculation). Battle solving though is an interesting solution. Might change the rating after several games, when get to know the game better. 
Update after second came: calculation went smoother and thus the game felt also to be right length - updated rating!

RATING: 10
An outstanding game. With an extraordinary simple rule set, it captures several key ideas from the 7 years war. The game becomes a war of position where you can maneuver to keep key points from falling, but be forced to fight a battle to defend a key point. 

The map captures the period feel. The use of a "road" net to move between towns nicely channelizes the approach routes. I was suspicious of the use of cards to simulate the tactical, but it captures the superior Prussian military capabilities. Dividing the map up into suite areas also gives both sides incentive to avoid or seek battle depending on the capabilities. 
The only missing components are sieges and leadership 
You could say that sieges are accomplished by the "zone of control" of a covering force preventing a location from falling. Field leadership could also be represented by the larger Prussian card deck. 

Ultimately the game does hinge on the cards of fate. This provides a needed sense of urgency to the allies. If you wait too long for an ally to take on the heavy lifting of taking on the Prussians, you may drop out of the war. I have found that to be especially true of the Russians.

RATING: 7
Here is a game that I want to rate higher, but it has some curious flaws in the way the game can end. This is a game that can take upwards of 5 hours to complete and involves a good amount of strategy without much luck (no dice). The big exception to this, however, is the use of a random card pull to determine if one or more countries is immediately removed from the game. So after 5 hours of planning and strategy and working towards your objective, the game can suddenly end for you on the random pull of a card. This might be a more enjoyable mechanic with a game that lasts 30-45 minutes, but it can leave the game feeling shockingly empty after so many hours of play. I only played it with 4 players, however, and I think that perhaps the 3 player game might help with this, as then only 1 player is controlling all of the disappearing countries and the loss of 1 would not mean a complete and immediate end to the game, although it would still have a huge impact.

3/11/2010 - I've change my opinion on this game after some plays. It is an excellent war game, very complete yet short rules. I feel like I'm really in the war. The fate cards that can randomly remove a nation at any time prevent it from being taken as a serious strategy war game entirely, but I think that is a plus.

RATING: 6.5
This game is weird. There are a lot of things I like about it, and a lot I don't.

First, in a four player game, is three against one (which itself isn't bad), but it's three individual players against one -- the three are not allowed to fight or block each other! So the player playing Friedrich has a much tougher and interesting game to play than the other three. However, this three against one approach totally eliminates any petty diplomacy problem found in multi-player war games. Still this is one thing I [b]don't[/b] like about this game.

The combat system is excellent! However, it really makes no thematic sense whatsoever. How come all my troops can use the same resources to attack each other? Why does the map have to be divided into a grid for combat purposes? Couldn't it be divided along geographical or political borders (I figured the grid is probably better since the board itself is very, very busy).

The game moves quite fast. However, I would've preferred a game that focused more on the combat and less on the logistics of simply moving around on the board.

RATING: 9
Really interesting and tense gameplay. Even though the rules are quite simple and your actions don't vary that much, time flies by like nothing. You start gaming and the next time you look at the clock it's 3 hours later and nobody would believe it. The fate cards have a huge impact on the flow of the game, so the outcome can be determined by the unlucky draw of the fate cards. For example when Sweden occupies all first order cities and Rusia drops out, it has imediatly won which might be considerably hard if Sweden needs to secure its objectives for a couple of rounds. Downtime can be a problem if there is a player prone to AP. The time commitment is also quite huge, games can last up to 6 hours, at least at our playing style which might not be the fastest. Apart from all that, I still enjoy Friedrich very much.

I wanted to like this game.  The mechanics seemed cool for a wargame, and implementation was novel.  However, it just didn't work for me.  I guess I'm not a fan of asymmetric wargames, or at least, not with more than 2 players.  It felt a lot like Axis & Allies, but with cards instead of dice.  Probably fun if you're Prussia or as a 2 player game, but not enough to keep everyone else engaged between turns.  I'd try it again, but it would have to be under ideal conditions.

It took far too long for what it was. Although I was engrossed with the history lesson throughout, I wasn't really satisfied with the game at the end. 

It's more about entrenchment and strategic retreat than combat. You can drive someone out of a city and she can remain close enough to be in control, so you can't claim it until you drive her further and further back, and THEN go through it again (JLIRL). I liked the playing cards as a combat element, but that belongs in a lighter game.

The time commitment to a single game is what keeps me from suggesting it to our group.

For me, this is an incredibly addicting game. It's a game that I want to play again and again.  The components are very nice, but the choice of the blue for Prussia with what looks like coastal markings is one reason I didn't give the game a 10.  I really like the asymmetry of the game, where each country and player has substantially different challenges.  The mechanics are simple, but the play is sophisticated.

Interesting unorthodox system that's not too complex, with a beautiful map, but it's sometimes hard to get 4 people together and finish such a potentially long (but unpredictable length) game, it seems. Arguably too random for such a long game, but this game is so cool that I like it a lot anyway. :)

I made the [[Friedrich FAQ]] in the wiki.

====

But a complaint about sub-standard markers:

The 110 square markers are very lamely die-cut: They have white side nubs sticking out where they were attached to the sprues, which are very hard to try trimming off, and make the markers look cheap and ugly. :( Most modern game companies know to have the markers attached at their corners, not in the middles of their sides.

(At least the nubs are a bit less obvious & cheap-looking than on my counters from Maria.)

A beautiful game designed with such care deserves better markers than these, which are not congruent with the rest of the game's otherwise excellent physical design.

RATING: 9
Amazing war-like game - love the card-based combat, the point-to-point movement, the secret army strength and reinforcements, the supply train mechanic... The event deck provides a great narrative, but can leave a player or 2 kind of out of the game if it goes long (but that incentivizes Russia, etc. to push harder early). It's not really 1-vs-many but rather three games of 1-vs-1, where one player is playing 3 games at the same time with only one hand of cards.  The fact that one player has to be willing to be the punching bag (Prussia) against the other players, and the game length, means that it's really hard to get this one to the table; otherwise I would buy it in a moment.  Maria improves the system in some ways and I rate it higher, but both games stand on their own.  Friedrich has more emphasis on the combat, with some big battles, card tracking can be more useful and predictable (at least for Prussia), and more narrative arc.  Maria is a better balanced game, less impact from the events/political cards, where each player has more or less an equal chance of winning and has to maintain the right balance to prevent an easy win by another player.

--Jun2005-- Perplexing, interesting, fascinating, frustrating; it's probably too subtle for me, in that I cannot perceive the ideal balancing point either for embattled Prussia or for one of the other powers.  While I admire the design, I don't think I'll be striving to try it again.

I guess this is called a mix of a wargame and an eurogame. Feels more like a wargame to me but has a unique combat mechanism. You need to watch out which type of area you are in (represented by regular card deck suits)when waging war. It's meant for 3-4 players but IMHO can be played with two but then the player playing Prussia has a tougher task ahead of him. Is a bit on a longer side but looking forward to playing this again.

A difficult game to rate after two plays, as it is so unusual. I love the method of creating conflict between the 'allies', the low 'counter density' (in so far as one can use the term for the game), the concentration on manoeuvre and the fog of war. I do fear, however, that a Prussian victory would take many, many hours of play, and I'm not sure if the game has enough variety to keep it interesting over that time. 3 1/2 hours seems over-optimistic for a game in which the Prussian player knows what he is doing: 5 seems more like it. Still, I need to play it more to give a final judgement; the fact that it works well with three is a big plus.

RATING: 7
Good game; history grain of salt. 

I feel this also would work better as a two-player or multiplayer cooperative. There is a way to play this with four--if each of the three attacking powers realizes that if it pushes too hard it is making it easier for another power to waltz in and win. If you play this way, players gather forces, feint and punch and duck and punch again, and eventually someone sneaks in for the win. 

This was a two-sided war, does a four-player game work? Only in the artificial way described above. 

Still, it's tense and fun, waiting for the shoe to drop as the vultures gather around Prussia. 

Being in an especially forgetful frame of mind, I've played a couple of solo games of Friedrich. A lot of subtlety of maneuver that's just beginning to dawn on me. It seems awfully tough to play Prussia, and I wish the generals had a bit more "personality", but otherwise amazingly appealing. 

Some early thoughts: Other than the above lack of color for individual generals, it is strange that the victor does not lose troops, and the contrast between winning and losing a battle is made even more stark in that the victor can choose the loser's avenue of retreat, which can lead to even more pounding very quickly.

I use colored gaming stones, by the way, to represent the taken victory cities.

OK, I've played it once with a group of complete beginners. Because I owned the game they all forced me to play Prussia. I played terribly and got wiped out both by Austria in the south Russia in the north, and France in the East. I completely screwed up every single front. I know I would play differently if I played again (and I wouldn't have to be, nor would I want to be, Prussia), and I do think that Friedrich is a really good game, but I just don't think that it is the right kind of game for me.Just had a second play. I controlled Russia & Sweden, and the last games winner (Austria) took control of Prussia. I really enjoyed Friedrich this time around. The game is really abstracted and yet it still felt like I was marching my troops of soldiers around the map and engaging in battles. A couple of negatives though. My Tsarina drank herself to death on the 2nd or 3rd event, and I was left with my one little Swedish general for the rest of the game who hardly did anything because I had to go through a diamonds sector to achieve my objectives but I never drew any (with my 1 card a turn). Could I have won the game with Russia before they dropped out of the game? Secondly, this game went on for quite a long time (about 5 and a half hours). Austria was on the verge of winning (only needed 1 more city), but the Prussians managed to really savage them and drive them back a little. They failed to recapture any of their cities back though, so after France dropped out of the game, the Imperial army changed hands and the Austrians won on relaxed victory conditions. All of this took quite a long time to get to, and it just felt that the game plays out for a lot longer than it should do. Saying that though, I think at least 2 of us would have immediately started another game if we didn't have to get home for sleep. We're definitely enjoying learning sensible strategies in the game. On a final note for now, I did actually sell this game to one of the other players of this group. I think Friedrich is a fantastic game (perhaps a little too long for what it is), but it just won't hit the table with my regular gaming group. I still regret selling it.

RATING: 9
The card mechanism forces players to hold back and wait or adopt a different approach to achieving their objectives. It works well and results in a fun bluffing element to play. Retreating into sections more favourable to yourself, as well as forcing your opponent to likewise is a subtle art form. However, at the end of the day Prussia is at the mercy of the sands of time cards. Should Russia and France withdraw early then Prussia will take the win. Clever play might be able to extend the fight from maybe 12-18 turns, but if the cards don't come out it's over for them. Likewise should the Russian or French player be knocked out early then their chances of winning with the Imperial army (and the Swedes) is extremely slim. That there's no countdown warning mechanism for these two players is an error in my opinion. It might reflect history but it just sucks if at the end of turn six you lose your major force and are forced to keep playing on for another 90 minutes with not a whole lot to do. If either of these players had a warning of impending elimination then they could at least give it one last hurrah.

Update: This plays so much better as a three player game because of the semi player pseudo elimination. Rules are very easy - did they rewrite them since the first edition? A light and yet thoroughly engaging game. No matter what the cards do to you it's just fun to play. You have to love the very clever combat system. Both this and Maria are right at the top of my most fun multiplayer war game list. Maria is the more serious and less luck based of the two, but something about Friedrich gives it it's own charm.

Each side tends to play in a different way - the Austrians make the big stacks and are on the offensive. The Russians and French need to coordinate their first attacks in hearts to secure the French their hardest objective with Russian help. The Prussians need to pick and choose their battles very carefully and resign themselves to losing most of them by the narrowest of margins to avoid any massive bleeding of their resources. It's all very clever how it dances together in the one game. Supply cubes open up the board to some manoeuvring in open space and unexpected plays. The uncertainty of army strength is not just clever in how joined armies can split and redivide forces, but also the reinforcement of an army on the move (if allowed) and how it can build before an attack - at a cost of course. The turn order needs to worked around and managed - even a successful attack against Prussia using all your cards can come back to haunt you as Prussia moves and draws new cards before you. Moreover a Russian bleeding of Prussian resources in a sector can be exploited by the Austrians with Russia having done all the hard work for no gain themselves. Lovely stuff. Lots to think about, but plays fluidly and without rules checking or anything very complicated to slow you down.

Don't be fooled, this is a wargame through and through... but a very novel and entertaining one.  The Prussian player absolutely must learn how to balance losing men and losing cards, and must make the best use of terrain and threats to keep the allies off balance.  The maneuver and topography of the game are exemplary of why I love wargames.  The suit-sector TC system seems gamey but is actually quite clever and convincing in practice.  In the end, though, the game clock / card deck, and some broken card acquisition/holding patterns, kept this from making the regular rotation.

[b]Friedrich[/b] is a game of subtle manoeuvre, bluffing, and realpolitik amongst convenient allies. The combat system is deceptively simple, but knowing which quadrant (i.e. suit) to fight and whether to try to win big or lose small is difficult and fraught with risk.

Do you fight Prussia in two areas of the same suit, hoping to exhaust his cards in one leaving none for the other? Should you try to convince Prussia to concentrate forces against a player on the cusp of victory? Should the alliance combine and exhaust Prussia's cards in a strategically located suit, and who takes the hits first? Should Prussia defend forward objectives, or fall back? And above all, am I in range of enemy units and friendly supply?

The rules can be learnt in as little as 10 minutes, but playing it well takes a great deal longer.

[5 plays] Beautiful game, innovative and clever mechanics, and nice tension make for a very enjoyable game. Prussia is definitely busier than a one legged man in an ass kicking contest. It may take a few plays before the players develop some good strategies to fight off the pack of wolves nipping at Fredrick.

My reservations after the first play are not huge, but it seems as though the game can run rather long (4-5 hours) and there may be some downtime if players get locked into too much turn analysis, especially for the non-Prussian players at times.

Overall, I liked the game and can see it making it to the table from time to time. 

Update 3-2010:  Still enjoying this one, despite no real love for the subject matter. This is a great design. Better with 3 than with 4 due to less downtime.

Most recent play Jan '17.

I'd love to see this rethemed and retooled to a 2 player game of American Civil War.

A porosz uralkodó elleni háborúra a hatalomra jutó Mária Teréziának sikerült megnyerni a franciákat, oroszokat és a svédeket is. Míg egy játékos a kezdetben erős Porosz Királyságot, a többi a játékos az ellene vonuló többi nemzetet irányítja. A többi nemzet vezetői tulajdonképpen szövetségesek a játékot mégis csak egy ország nyerheti meg. Mindegyiküknek különböző célpontokat kell meghódítaniuk, Frigyesnek azonban ugyanilyen célok elérésén kívül, adott körön túli életben maradás is a győzelmet hozza.
Szép, jól kidolgozott tábla, jó tartozékok. Érdekes ötlet a más országokban járó tábornokok utánpótlásának szükségessége. Jó ötlet a harc kártyákkal való megoldása. Adott régióban, adott színű kártyával lehet harcolni. Nekem két dolog nem tetszett az első játék alkalmával. Egyrészt eléggé egyértelmű szerepek vannak a nemzetek számára, másrészt a kártya nagy szerencseszerepe. Egy-egy tábornokhoz maximum 8-as nagyságú sereg tartozhat, amellett, hogy egyesülhet két sereg úgy éreztem, a kártyák sokkal jobban döntenek mint kellene. Nagyobb sereglétszámánál talán nem lenne annyira sok teljes vereség, mint így. Lehet ezek csak az első játék hibái, de úgy éreztem nagyobb a szerencse szerepe, mint sima kockákkal lenne. Persze későbbi játékokban ez sokkal jobban koordinálható majd.
A játék mindenképp ajánlható a wargame-ekkel ismerkedőnek, jó átvezető a komolyabb játékok felé úgy érzem.

RATING: 6
I really love this game, but I fear that it has a serious fatal flaw.  Once the card balance starts to swing, players will hold on to suits that they don't need and not attack in suits where they think are weak.  Twiddle thumbs.

Soon, players will get to a point where they cannot hope to achieve their victory condition as a region will require them to gain cards that they will never hope to achieve.  This eventually can lead to players hands getting locked up with useless cards, no incentive to move forward, and waiting for the stalemate to break.

I would play this again if you could trade in the value of six pips or perhaps two cards for another draw.  This would flush useless cards out of hands and get more excitement going.

Otherwise it is a brilliant system.  A real shame about the lock up.  If the bugs could get worked out of this, I suspect it would go up to an 8 in my book, without the fix this gets a 4.  So, I'm middleing it...

RATING: 9
Update after a 2er game v Earl (7 YEARS after my last play of this!). 2er is a good way to learn/remember the rules, but almost nothing like the real game!

A great "weuro" game; good use of hand management in the blend of card game and board game. Prussia feels pressured the entire game, having to run around defending multiple fronts. The rest have to cooperate with each other, weakening Prussia in specific suits -- but not too much or they'll let an "ally" win the game! The game can be a bit long, but that should improve after repeated play (my second game ... essentially my first since I didn't remember much of the rules, was 5 hours). Regardless, it doesn't _feel_ long when playing the game!

I would love to play this more! I wonder, though, if it's quite as much fun if you're not Prussia?

This is a very light wargame with a surprising hidden intrinsic depth to it.  It's very much about card hand management and positioning your Generals and their armies in the regions that you are strong in of a particular suit.

Starting position: I'm not a wargame's fan.
A very well designed wargame. The components are very good, a fantastic board, lots of strategic movements. High replayability. The possibility of playing with different countries makes a completely different strategy for each time you play.
Luck is present as in all wargames, but it's a bit more fair than the usual. 4 hours.

RATING: 8.5
Simple rules allow you to dive right into the strategy, and there's a lot of it. Everything is abstracted quite cleverly, so while you have to deal with troop movements, building army strength, supply, escape routes, etc., it's all very easy to absorb--easier for me, in fact, than in almost any other wargame I've played. The card suit battle mechanism leads to a lot of tense decisions as it leads you to maneuver quite carefully. The event deck, map and named leaders give it all a nice splash of history which even offers a wry strain of humor throughout.

Great design with interesting factions and rules.  The battle resolution, while awkward at first, is a great original idea.
 
It all comes down to being only fun for the Prussian and Austrian player (the other are pretty scripted).  The wait time between turns are giving me flashbacks of Axis&Allies.

I don't know if it is always the case, but since this is a 3 against 1 game; the Prussian while end up doing king making in most game (depending on the card draw).

It's a good game, strong design, but my desire to play is really low.

Packs a surprising amount of strategic (and tactical) oomph with such a simple design. It really is one of those games for which the word 'elegant' was invented. Our group (about nine of us have played it) unanimously enjoy and rate this game highly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Played once with four and had great fun.  I played as the French, and I still had fun even though each other player took two turns apiece as I waited for it to get to me.  Long stretches in between turns are frustrating, especially when you only have 2 or 3 moves to make on your own turn.  Even more frustrating are the fate cards.  If the one declaring France bankrupt had come up, I probably would have thrown over the game board.  Your entire game rests on the chance of one of those cards coming up, and it is a little too much luck for me.  Lucky for us, our Russia was doing terribly, so when the czarina died, it was no biggie.  I'd play again as Prussia, and I am looking forward to it, but that may be it for me.  Good game, but too long to deal with the much chance.

RATING: N/A
Game not heavy on theme.  Easy to learn and play.  The combat system is unique and interesting, but it is heavily dependent on drawing the right cards. Not crazy about players switching powers during the game.  Components are very good - colorful mounted mapboard, wood playing pieces, somewhat durable cards with fair artwork.  Game length is around 2.5 hours which seems a bit long.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Simple and elegant rules for an unusual configuration : one side (Friedrich) against three other sides; the victory is allowed for only one player howver, so the allies are teamed up against Friedrich but there is also a small competition and negotiation between them. Simple and original combat resolution on a very functionnal and beautiful board. Very good with four players and optimal with three players. A must-have for any wargamer looking for a multiplayer game which allows also non- wargamers to play!

A 10 if you are Prussia.

Two thoughts -

It's MUCH longer than the box suggests... depending on the success of the Prussians, you're looking at 4-6 hours normally.  A prussian victory (unlikely until you have a few plays in) might take even longer.

Also, it is probably better with 3 than 4 as the Russian and French players have a little too much downtime with 4.  That said, if you have people that don't mind that, the game is certainly better with different players handling France and Russia.

Anyway, awesome game.

A game of agonizing decisions for the Prussia player, otherwise fairly easy for the others. Could possibly score a 9.5 if not for the slight unapproachabilty of playing the Prussia player for a new player. Could also take a very long time for new players. 

Need more plays to see if i could still raise its ratings. Very thematic and ingenious gameplay. I am spoilt by its gameplay and theme.

The components are beautiful, the gameplay is engaging.  The only downside is that our play-group is typically five players, so it only gets played when someone is missing the game.  It is also a stress-fest for the Prussian player, so you need players who keep cool under fire.  

This is a game for people who want to play their best first, and win second.  The final victor won't always be the one who makes all the right calls, but a better player will take more than their share.

Wonderful Game. Playing with Prussia is a Nightmare, you end up seriously burned out mentally. I very much prefer Maria for this reason, but still I wouldn't reject any opportunity to play Friedrich when there are four players. Haven't played with the other powers, but it seems for a more relaxing game than either Prussia in this game or any of the powers in Maria.

I've played this a couple times now, and while I like the game, I tend to think that luck plays too large a role in the game.  I've played Prussia both times I've played, and whether Prussia wins seems more determined by the cards of fate than by any other factor.  Maybe fewer cards of fate is the answer to the problem, but at any rate, I don't think it was a problem solved by the designer.

Also, both games I've played of it went to 5 hours without being resolved by gameplay or the cards of fate.

This game is so good, but it has to be one of the hardest games ever to get people interested in.  I personally think it is a very attractive game, but people seem to be put off by it.

A very unique and impressively unencumbered fusion of a point-to-point wargame and a traditional card game.  Nice balance of strategic and tactical considerations.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This game really is a behemoth of a game. There's lots to like but also, there are some disturbing issues. 

On the plus side:

+ The clever role of the cards in the battles, in which you sometimes have to decide where you have to lose a battle so you can - in the long-run - win the war. Yes, really. Sometimes it's better to lose and not waste all your resources (cards) and instead retreat (but not too far. You still want to be in protecting distance of your cities)
+ the considerations you have to make in regards to where you move your troops (depending on what your "trumps are and where they are best used for defensive purposes or aggressive rattling of the sabre)
+ having to anticipate your opponent's strong cards
+ having four different "nations" that all play completely different (probably - I've just played Prussia so far, but it seemed to differ a lot from the play of the Austrian and/or the French/Russian player (3-player-game)
+ there's so much anxiety, it's very likely you'll have to bite your nails all the time. Going first as Prussia and afterwards see the other nations close in on you and tighten the net step by step guarantee a highly involving gameplay. Odds can change very fast and though it looked good for Prussia in the beginning, at the end any nation but Prussia was close to victory

On the other side:

- there's the event deck, which is way too big and far too random. There's a significant difference between "Prussia has to go against Russia and Austria (and a little against France) for 18 game rounds. Or "Prussia can pretty much throw everything they've got towards the armies of Maria Theresia starting with game round 6. I would have loved for thatscenario to happen. All I would have lost is a measly general.
- I think the game is brutal enough on Prussia. There's no need for penalizing it even further. Unless the ideal condition happens and Russia vanished from the map in roun 6. But then and only then should you think about penalizing Prussia. 
- it is a veryyyyyy long game


This game needs quite a bit of investment. And I don't mean the monetary one but on a level of trying to find out what the right game balance is. If everyone turns against Prussia with all their forces I have high doubts that Prussia has even the slightest chance of winning. It'll boil down to who gets to occupy his cities first. You want Prussia weak enough for you to be able to run over them once you get the chance to ( or let's better say "once it's smart for you to make use of the chance to") but on the other hand you want it to be strong enough that your other opponents don't run over them. If you didn't hurt Prussia enough though and you're left alone with it: Prussia says thank you. 

Hurting Prussia is easy: by throwing your forces against them. 
But hurting your other opponents is possible by only one means. Russia, Austria and France will never get into a direct conflict. So how can you harm them? Basically the only way to have a conflict with them is by not attacking Prussia as hard as you possibly could. Maybe even wait with an attack. However, as the Russian player might get expelled from the game in round 6, he sure doesn't consider this an option... tricky, tricky and once again: tricky! 
I'd really like to play the game again, if I should find the time. But I must subtract at least a full point in the rating for the shockingly important factor of the randomly drawn event cards. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Friedrich is one of the better "light" wargames I've played over the past few years.  Instead of hundreds of chits to lose, its got little wooden pucks and in place of dice rolling it resolves battles through the use of cards.  It holds up well with repeated plays since changing the country you play (Russia, Austria, Prussia, France, etc.) calls for entirely different strategies for each country.  The clock of fate is a nice feature since it gives the player handling Friedrich some hope of surviving if..he..makes..it...one... more...turn.  If you're looking for a challenge for four players give Friedrich a look.

RATING: 9
So impressed with the design on this one. Beautiful is a word I'd apply here that I would only think of using for a few others (maybe some by Bowen Simmons).

I find it funny that some dislike this being called a wargame. How is reducing entire battalion or corps sized units to counters with discrete 5-3 ratings, applying a combat modifier from a table because the unit is on a hex that has been arbitrarily called "a hill", and rolling some dice any more "realistic" or less of an abstraction than the card-modified (for terrain suit) deterministic combat resolution model here? Really they are both abstractions, but between the two this one is not only simpler but captures some things that I think get missed in many hex and counter style games: the essence of the commander's dilemma. 

But, that is a polemical point to make here. I'll save any further diatribe for when I have the time to fully flesh out some real thoughts. The only point worth making here is that this is a wargame with a strategic depth to it that goes way beyond what one might guess upon first looks. The way this game uses cards proves that even a very simple and seemingly nonsensical abstraction in a game system can be used to great effect to simulate and account for the problems and situations inherent in real-world problems and decision-making. The most profound models often reduce complicated processes into simple key dynamics, whereby new layers of the underlying complexity of a system begin to emerge having been distilled from the chaos. You may not be thinking of the exact, specific terrain features that concerned Friedrich himself, but you are thinking more like Friedrich than you realize just in the way you are having to manage your resources, choose your ground so that it is suited (pun intended!) to your force disposition and logistics, and  use interior lines and greater economy of force to try and overcome an overall deficiency in sheer mass of forces by defeating your opponents opportunistically, one at a time. I would go so far as to call the design poetic.

The components are beautiful. The only thing I don't like is the paper army sheets. I would prefer something physical, like the make-shift matchbox systems some folks use to hide cubes representing the armies (only revealed during battle). That makes cheating/mistakes/trust less of a concern and makes management easier. Pen and paper are not things I enjoy having to employ when playing a wargame. But I can forgive that. Everything else is so well thought out and so well put together. The board is a thing of beauty, too. The end result gives you something that has a truly high standard of quality and elegance. 

A game that you don't just play--you ponder it. You make your moved carefully, debate with yourself, perhaps sipping a nice glass of wine while processing your strategic options. I really want to get some non-solo plays of this in.

Should one even bother buying this with Maria also available? I would say yes. Personally, I'm not yet convinced that Maria's added weight and convolutions add enough to make it a "better" game. Besides, I think playing Friedrich first makes total sense, as the latter is a logical extension of many of the same ideas, with enhancements and tweaks and curve balls thrown in. But I really like the purity of Friedrich and I have a feeling I will end up preferring it. If you're a purist, or perhaps just a simpleton like me, you might find yourself agreeing.

9-8-07: After 1 play as Austria:  I can see how this would be grueling for the Prussian player, as I had enough on my plate watching after only the Austrians and the Imperial Army.  It seems that there are some games that distill several concepts together in such a way that the whole alchemically reveals something greater than the separate parts.  Perhaps Friedrich is one such game.  Among the elements it combines: very elegant but tactical card-play; allies working together to prevent the (somewhat unpredictable) game-end but with mutually-exclusive victory conditions; slower supply lines and faster units; a board that combines a traditionally-strategic map with the overlay of the different card "terrains".  Each element is itself a balancing act.  Throwing them all together sounds like it could make a clunky machine, but they blend seamlessly.  First game was l-o-n-g, but it didn't hurt initial rating too much.

Great game of a very interesting period in European history. Game play develops a lot of tension. You normally can't tell who's gonna win due to lots of surprising developments during play. Although the game is highly abstracted and not very historically accurate, it is an excellent game with high re-play value. Highly recommended!

Un jeu de guerre qui ne se veut pas une simulation parfaite et complexe. Ça reste un jeu avec des mécanismes qui encouragent le bluff, simule un brouillard de guerre et entrainent des revirements.

Iconic, asymmetrical wargame of maneuver based on the Seven Years' War.  A Euro-version of Fortress America, using playing cards instead of dice.

Played that twice and quite liked it despite its long playtime which is always a downside for me. 
Also influence of events seems abit drastic to me. It makes a huge difference whether Russia stays in the war or is taken out of it by an event card no matter their actual military situation. Rules are pretty simple though while quite some tactical and strategic depth is offered. Combat randomness is greatly done as there are no dice but cards at your disposal.

For the allied players, nice balance of going after Friedrich whole hog, but not so much that you hand the game to one of the other players. Both the hardest and the most interesting role is Friedrich himself.  He's got to try to play very well in four different theaters at once.  Retreat too quickly and you'll be at death's door before you know it.  Retreat too slowly and you may get surrounded and cut off, or out of the cards you need.  I've only played without the advanced rules, but looking over them again, and knowing how the game went, I don't think it would be too much to tackle even on the first play.  Great game of maneuver and bluff.

This is a great game. Played once. Loved the theme and the implementation. The card based combat mechanism is excellent. Can't wait to get it on the table again. My only gripe is the lack of markers to show the ownership of objective cities. The whole postcard thing is really daft.

Sistema de juego muy original y que a pesar de su aparente simpleza (se explica en 10 minutos) tiene una gran toma de decisiones estratégicas. Si te gusta "pasarlo mal" durante un juego te recomiendo que lleves a Federico de Prusia para saber lo que es bueno.

RATING: 8.5
A very nice game indeed. Relatively simple rules and a clever movement and combat system provide for near continuous exitement as each player wheigh his own chances. The need to balance your own attack on Prussia in such a way that you do not make life too easy for the other attackers makes for very difficult decisions. Playing Prussia is a roller coaster of manouvering your amries to draw the enemy away, quick retreats, and the occasional deadly battle.

RATING: 6
The rules are very simple yet the geography of the board creates an immense amount of depth. The card system is surprisingly fun and there are many ways to circumnavigate the luck of the draw. What can't be overcome however is the luck of the cards of fate, which seem to have more of an effect on who wins than anything else. But forgetting this fact and taking the game as an experience it is quite enjoyable- unless it goes on too long, which can happen depending on how the cards come up. In conclusion an exceptionally good game for the experience but problematic at its core. UPDATE: the problem is that Maria really does make this game almost obsolete. Perhaps when I burn out on Maria this will be something refreshing to revisit, but in comparison it just has so many flaws.

One Play.  I like what I saw, but I have a few reservations: Prussian victory, or defeat, seems to hinge entirely upon the Cards of Fate.  While this may be evocative of the real conflict, I'm not sure if it makes a compelling game.  My opponents, however, really enjoyed the game.  Need more plays.  Update 11/13/17: Gave this one away to Mike D.

It plays well, and the asymmetry is definitely well thought out. As for the board grid, cards and card-suit divisions... it just feels completely detached. Why not terrain cards? Some kind of luck or preparation flavour? Just numbers? Who invited Knizia to this party?

Also essentially too long for what it is - re: Chaos In The Old World vs Kemet.

RATING: 9
Friedrich is an excellent game. I had some reservations about the tactical cards going into the game, however they were allayed through play. Moreover, Friedrich is an excellent multi-player wargame. It is obvious that years and years of playtesting went into this elegantly designed game. I highly recommend it.

I really like the suit-based combat system. It's a nifty innovation that leads to a lot of interesting decisions, bluffs, and some tense battles.

Unfortunately I do not like other aspects of the game so much. Some players really don't have that much to do, and can be totally stalled out by simply not drawing the suit they need to make an attack on their objectives. And I hate the idea of playing for hours only to have my country be knocked out by an event card or, even worse, to do well as Austria/Imperials and then have someone else take over the Imperials just in time to win the game with them.

I would like to see another game that uses the clever suit-based combat but in a different setting where the sides are more even and random events are less powerful.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
One of my favourite games. It's an intense game! Lots of maneuvering, nailbiting card-fights (keep those reserve cards for escaping!). 

For Prussia it is like dancing on a volcano, pull back with as little loss of cards and troops as possible and when necessary strike hard. 

For France, Austria and Russia it's all about fighting against Prussia and the Clock of Fate, and that clock keeps ticking. So you must react and try and hit Prussia in the right suit, and Prussia's hand is BIG... 

My first 2 plays were 4-player games, my third play a 3-player game. No problem at all for experienced players! For me it's a perfect 3-4 player game.

If you like this game, buy Maria too, you won't regret it!

A solid strategy/war game.  The cards really are my "cat's meow".  I love card management and this one forces you to plan you battles via the cards.  A keeper. (Rules in English and German w/no text on the cards.)  I'll need to play more to determine if my rating will go up.  Beautiful map and card components as well.

RATING: 6
Very good game, but it might be best with 3 players, as the downtime can get brutal.  In our last game, the Russians dropped out of the war on the first card of fate draw...not fun if you are playing them in a 4 player game, but okay as you still have the French in 3 player.  Fun combat system, you have more control than you think.  Knowing when to stand and fight and when to concede battles is KEY.  Bad luck with card draws is not a disaster; the game is long, and one can bide their time in order to build a hand if needed.  Playing cagey can work, then campaign with the hand you built up.  Where luck can play a role is the cards of fate draws, but it is no worse than any wargame that uses dice and/or cards.

RATING: 1
The most overvalued game on BGG. Thinking about this game alone makes me frown. I gave it a couple of tries after the awful first game, but they only confirmed me how terrible this game is. The most disgusting part of Friedrich is that this is one of the games that pretend to be deep, but it is not. 

Decision-makings are stupidly simple in this game. Every single army of any player follows the same rule, and the armies cannot move too far. In addition, there are food-supply restrictions, and the "objectives" you must conquer are pre-determined. So the number of possible decisions(horizontal complexity) you can make in your turn is quite limited. Also, there is not much vertical complexity; that is, you don't have to plan 'far ahead' in your turn. Or more precisely, you can't, because every randomness in this game is quite dramatic. For example, the cards that you play for battle are essentially worth the same number of armies as their values. But this game's deck composition follows the normal playing card deck's. (or four of them if you insist)So, values on the card range from 2 to 13, excluding a couple of jokers that act as "10". That is, standard deviation of 3.39. This is ridiculously high. Rolling two six-sided dice like in Catan will give you SD=2.45, and in Catan, the dice rolls are not private; it give goods to everyone who has a settlement on the number rolled. But in Freidrich, your private hand which can be converted to your army in 1:1 ratio has such a high SD! Also the event card can literally knock you out from the game. Defenders would say "oh-oh, you should've won the game before that happens," but I disagree. You never know when you'll be knocked out, and hence you can't plan anything. The control of a kindom also randomly moves depending on the events. The best thing you can do is keep pushing and trying to win "this" turn, and if you can't win this turn, just hope you'll get lucky.

So, the "tactical" decisions in this game are really vulnerable to all sorts of lucks. However, the amazingly complicated connections on the map(far worse than power grid) makes it hard for people to figure out the distance from one point and another, and the arbitrary rectangles on the map makes it even harder to understand the map. The game can be played much faster if it was a computer game, which will highlight the ares that your supply trains can reach, and those that your armies can protect.

This game, deep inside, is nothing more than a card-drawing game. It is not even a card-driven game where you try to manage bad hands. This is more like "uno," but with an unnecessarily complicated board. Considering the strategic/tactical/or whatever depth, if there's any, of this game, it is supposed to be a 30-minute long game. But the total downtime during which you cannot even plan ahead for your next move takes up way more than that.

Apparently there are a lot of people who like this game, but I recommend you NEVER BUY THIS GAME BEFORE YOU PLAY IT.

RATING: 5.5
I liked the mechanics, but I don't think I'll be keeping this one.  To be honest, there are one of two possibilities.  My thought is that the only way for Prussia to win is to get lucky and have the Russia/France/Sweden get out of the war cards come up really fast.  Alternatively, maybe I wasn't a very good Prussian player, and to win, Prussia has to be an excellent player with reasonable luck.  Either way, I don't see much of a future for this game in my collection.  I think the right answer is that Prussia can only win if it gets lucky.  That is too much of a luck element for me in a 3  hour game.  On the other hand, if you have to know the game really well to win with Prussia, it is never going to get played, because I don't want to devote enough time to a game to become an "expert" in it.

All against one co-oppetition Seven Years simulation wargame between Frederick the Great and the rest of the known world along the road routes of Prussia.  Startup is the same with Generals at preset locations.  Must maintain supply lines. Card play use traditional card suits to delineate map regions for resolving combat that also causes retreat.  Prussia player is almost a tower defense delay to last to the fate cards phase that force countries to withdraw while the opponents are trying to capture their specific strategic objectives-clever winning conditions.

Ooh, ooh, ohh, I REALLY wanna play this game, but am having no joy tempting the missus/family to learn the rules. 
Unfortunately I imagine the game would play best with 4 players, and is totally unsuitable for solo test playing.
Looks and sounds good though!

A different take on a wargame.  Maneuver around central Europe; if you're Friedrich, try to keep alive until Russia or France drop out of the war.  As the other 3 allied players, try to take key objectives but hope your allies don't get ahead.  Combat is a curious sort of a card game - odd, but it works.  A great no-dice wargame.

Exceedingly clever game that has weeks of downtime with four players.  Rating will likely increase ([i]edit[/i] - yep) after playing with three.

The balance is way off in favor of the anti-Prussian forces, but Friedrich is still fun to play.  Also, if Prussia plays well and the cards go poorly, the game can be punishingly long.  As a variant I'm strongly considering removing 2-4 minor event cards from the Fate deck (at random) at the start of each game.

It is great game if your are playing Prussia or Austria ... but if you get stuck with a little country it tends to be very boring and you get the feeling that even your success is more in the hands of other players (eg. if Prussia decides to go hard on you will lose, even if they will as well).

Wow, very, very impressive game.
I found it hard to predict how it would play.
Second play was really fast and furious.
Adrenaline pumping, really great game!

Third play, Prussia was really avoiding confrontation at the beginning. While controling key points. Great game, cards do have a huge effect.
But I kind of like that :)

I love the depth of this game. I have seen Frederich use everything he has to just ward off oblivion just one more round. The rules are simple and straightforward. The randomness is in the card draws, but even this does not bother me. I also like the long length of the game and the 'alliance of powers' meta-game.

I have received many complements for how well I taught the game, but the truth is I was standing on the shoulders of giants. Thanks to everyone who has submitted player aids for Friedrich!! :)

I've only played once with three, but my 8.5 rating seems pretty solid and may go up.  I won with Russia, and I'll say that having the ability to use France to annoy and suck cards away from Prussia seems a little overpowered in the 3 player version.  The only complaints seemed to be about game length--it took 5 hours and could have gone longer.  I don't mind but some of my friends seem to.  My pick for best of Origins '05.

Wonderful game. 15 mn to explain the rules, but subtle to play. Plays fast despite complexity. A german game based upon fighting, with lots of interactions (try to find 3 other ones).  Wonderful material (graphic design of tactical cards is wonderful) for a quite decent price. Is it a game for everybody ? No. Wargame purists won't like (a simple set of rules - no dice rolls - no modificators - no hex - all that stuff sacrified to playability). And some boardgamers could consider this game "too serious". One word: clever.

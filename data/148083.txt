Um dos títulos da MS Jogos que mais demorou para chegar na coleção. Acho que os únicos que eu realmente tive algum problema foram o Ovni e Gran Circo. Preciso ver as novas edições e ver se o coração amolece com esses, rs

O jogo flui direitinho e é o grande hit da editora, principalmente pelo tema, que grada a todos.

This is a neat game.  It's a light intro to pick-up and deliver as well as worker placement.  The theme is definitely present as you play the game; things just make sense.  One house rule I added was that you can't jump over dogs to get to other dogs; that just felt un-thematic to me.

Great intro into resource management type games. Seems confusing at first but after a play or two the game is revealed as quite simple...at least from a rules and play perspective. There are a number of points where making the wrong decision will land you in deep doo-doo. Beautiful production values makes pleasing to the eye.  My wife’s only complaint so far is that there should be an phase to place the pooches into their forever homes. Recommended for dog lovers and (non-cat owning) gamers alike.

Lindo jogo! Com tema mais fofo ainda. Divertido, com todos os elementos necessários pra aprofundar qualquer um no mundo dos boardgames. Boa quantidade de decisões para tomar, e um tema que faz com que explicar as decisões faça muito sentido, é algo palpável e não abstrato, como consultar cães doentes, alimentar os cães resgatados, comprar remédios, ração, ter gasolina para gastar, manter raças diferentes separadas e fazer investimento nos canis pessoais para poder aumentar a capacidade, logo, pontuar mais.

Bday gift for Shannon--with Artemis' name on a card. Arrived 13 NOV, a month late and the board was damaged and a yellow meeple was broken. However, the game itself was fun. It has elements of set collecting, worker placement, and resource allocation and planning. A pretty good family gateway game.

The game is ok.
The board is bigger than necessary. Could be cut 1/4 at least.
The art is ok. I would prefer either more cartoony dogs or more realistic dogs. Also the colors are washed away.
The ruleset seems unpolished and the rulebook needs two lectures to understand it completely.
Wife and I are in the fence with it. Time will tell...

RATING: 6.1
So the game seems pretty simple at first, move, pick up dogs, arrange your kennels, take actions (there's only 5 to choose from), feed, pay, etc. Pretty straightforward stuff.  However, the decisions are tougher then you'd expect. If you end up overreaching this turn, your next turn could be rough and you could simply be praying for the right cards to show up (and then to actually be available to you when it's your turn).  More than likely if you need a specific resource, so does everyone else and frankly, some cards are just much better than others.

The game is very tight, resources are just as scarce late in the game as they are early on. Each dollar you spend is very important.

It was a little longer than I'd expected but then again I'd thought this was going to be super light and so I was wrong on both counts.  This was a birthday present for my daughter and I believe she also expected something light and fluffy and so was getting frustrated that she had to play it reserved at times. Though she said it was "tough fun" so she liked it in the end.

Kind of an under-the-radar, underrated game that is surprisingly good.  The theme and box art suggest a kind of lightweight, fluffy game, but Dogs --while offering nothing completely new or innovative -- combines some of the best elements of pick up and deliver, worker placement, set collection as well as resource management.  Just about everyone I've introduced the game to has enjoyed it.  Lots of fun!  Recommended.

This is less a game I'll play for fun and more an educational tool. Despite a great theme it is a bit dry. But it simplifies and dissects many modern board game staples, making several mechanisms — tableau building, resource management, and worker placement — easy to understand for the neophyte.

[thread=1567560]It's a fun, simple and straightforward resource management and set collection game with a light, family friendly theme.[/thread] You rescue animals and bring them back to your animal rescue center, then you feed them and medicate them if they are ill. You must also expand your facilities to accomodate more animals, and you want, preferably, animals of the same race or species to score more points. Plays quickly and requires strategy and planning one or two rounds ahead.

1 play game is good,  but we both made mistakes by growing to early our kennels without having adequate resources and the game brutally punished us for it. This game reminds me of a faster streamlined Agricola. 

The art betrays you into thinking is a kids game!  Very heavy be aware (at 2 player's that is)

SOLD bad first experience

Just got our Kickstarter copy fresh off the press. However this isn’t the fluffy gateway game we were expecting let me tell you! You need to do some careful planning and calling this a lighter Agricola is spot on. The ending was a bit sudden and left me in a mess as my plans for dogdom domination were to be achieved a round later. Nevertheless this game was thoroughly enjoyed by all. Looks beautiful - wonderfully produced!

Happy to keep this but could be persuaded to trade if for something special.

Got this to the table as a 2 player game and after the game I feel that it will be a better 4 player game with all Dogs available. Just seamed like for 2 players that all the same dogs come out. Plus if one person goes for the dogs that provide money then you can really hose the other player and make money tight for them. Still a fun game though.

Após 3 jogos com 2 (x2) e 3 (x1) jogadores:
Bom jogo, com regras simples e escolhas intuitivas para administrar seu canil. Como a informação do seu canil é aberta, prepare-se para um certo fator bloqueio dos outros jogadores. E não esqueça de acumular ração para o fim do jogo! E mantenha seu canil grande!

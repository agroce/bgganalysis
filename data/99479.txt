Very nice family game. Simple choices and not much interaction but perfect to play with smaller ages though or if you need a nice break from long brainburners! Artwork concept is really nice and it's a game I'd like to do more plays with soon :)

Beautiful looking game with a very cool art style, but that's about all there is to like about this one.

Basically, your goal is to catch some fish and cash them in at port, establishing prices for the fish that are high for the fish you've delivered to port.  On your turn, you get three actions which use use to move your boats, catch fish, and deliver them to port.  There aren't really many options available, and turns tend to take about 15 seconds.  In the end, the player who delivered the most valuable load of fish wins.

An extremely simple game that honestly seems like it should have been marketed as a children's game, but deceivingly comes across as if it would be more gamery.

RATING: 7
Short pickup and deliver game that can be used as a filler. Somewhat flawed as a game, because some initial placement spots are far better than others. The first person to place there will have an advantage, and if others try to compete in the same spot, you will leave the other ports free for other players.

I got the best initial starting spot in the game, and believe this was a major driver why I won.

The game plays in about 30 minutes to an hour and is super quick to teach. There isn't much down time either. Looking forward to getting this out to the table more.

Players are fisherman, plying the Baltic Sea.  Players on their turn spend three actions to either move boats, fish an area, or sell fish back in a port.  Boats must form a continuous chain of four boats across the sea areas, making movement a leapfrog affair.  Fishing simply means picking up a token from a sea area with a boat, and pulling it on one of your five slots for fish.  Selling fish simply unloads your boat and turns fish into victory points.  Emptied sea areas are replenished from a bag of tokens, which also contains the game clock.  At six points during the game you have to allocate (secretly) victory point chips to your fish types, which will be a multiplier at the end of the game.  

Fun game - very light, looks nice with a very original clay-art look.  Not sure how many plays it will see, but certainly solid.

RATING: 7
A family game with depth, Mare Balticum gives each player a small fleet of boats with which they must ply the Baltic Sea, collecting fish.  By selling the fish at the ports, the players collect money, and in the end, the one with the most money wins.  The artwork is superb (clay modeling) and the gameplay is streamlined to the point of accessibility even for children, but yet still offers enough depth that adults will not get bored.  Perhaps not easy to find anymore, but still a solid family game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.2
Mare Balticum first and foremost presents itself as a very beautiful game.  To know all of the art was sculpted out of clay and then turned into the board and its components is a really great idea.  Not only did they pull it off, but I'm not aware of any game that's done that before.  Quite unique!  Talking about the game now, I haven't played a lot of pick-up and delivery games, but I do like this mechanic.  It's quite simplistic here, but it works really well.  I like how the fish show up and don't mind the luck so much.  I can see though that if the game were much longer in length, that luck would get a little grating.  As it is though, it works out well and fills up a nice 30 minutes.

With 5 the game is broken. Here the luck decides who will win, because there is no time to really travel anywhere. If the game would work, this might actually be quite nice game for the whole family - maybe it's better with fewer players, but why the heck even put game pieces for the 5 players if it won't work... ??? What did I liked here was the beautiful artwork. But the map is a bit too small for the all components, which brings some usability issues. And the map is unbalanced.

After few plays my opinion is that some areas on board (especially between Riga, St. Peterburg and Stockholm) are way too small to put for example three ships and two fish tokens. Gameplay is slow-paced, what helps to introduce the game to children. For family quite good, but for geeks it could be very boring.
I rate it as a family game.

I am filled with love for this awesome little filler. So far have only played the basic game but it is quick and fun. Both of which I like. Tried it on the Saturday of Bordercon (2012) and taught/played it five or six times over the rest of the weekend (and bought it, too). Including to the Bigster, who liked it as well.
The beautiful artwork doesn't hurt either.
I think this will work well as a family game with our girls, who are now 13 and 9.

I played a few pretty good new-to-me games this month, but MB is head and shoulders above the rest. It’s a 20 - 30 minute game with great components, distinctive artwork and a rather fun theme.

In essence, players send their fishing fleets to the Baltic to catch fish (or amber) and then unload their catch at a port that favours the particular sort of fish they have caught.

The great mechanic is that at random times throughout the game the players must secretly decide the points that each of the different types of fish will score for them. And well as pay a tax of two tokens at some stage.

This works really well and makes each game different (says the veteran of one whole game) as sometimes you’ll have a fait idea of how you’re travelling but others you’ll have to assign an arbitrary value and hope.

A great game with a lot of replayability. I fully intend to purchase this one.

With five players, the game ends way too quickly, and the number of ships available is also so low that there's very little chance of ever sailing to any other port than your starting place.

Significantly better with four players.

Mare Balticum is a light family game that plays fast (ca. 35 minutes) and looks beautiful (great artwork and components quality). Unfortunately it's also a very boring game. Not fun at all.

RATING: 6
Players are Baltic fishermen, netting, transporting and selling both fish and amber (scooped up in trawls- true!). Mare Balticum has a cool timer mechanism - some of the replacement fish tiles are time advances instead- and it also has interesting markets and transport rules. But it ends just as it is getting interesting, and the colour choices are very difficult. I read a little about it before playing, and somehow got the notion that there is a lot more to Mare Balticum. But it is really just a long filler. Leaving aside the difficulty caused by colourblindness, it was fine to play. But not terribly stimulating.

--Aug2012-- A very light pickup and deliver game, probably aimed right in the wheelhouse of my youngsters three or four years ago.  Today, though, they're looking for something a bit more demanding.  Still, this is fast, straightforward, and not completely trivial:  it's a nice design.

I've tried many times to come up with the reason this bores me so. I'm not sure, but it may be a game rhythm/timing issue. There's no real story, it just ends, sometimes very abruptly. And in between there happen to be these tax paying and fish price setting times. (What do they stand for, anyway? Specialization? But in what sense?) It all happens too soon and it's all over so quickly that you don't feel to have had many choices. But we also played it wrong this one time (oh, right, so you have three actions per turn, not just one, whoops). Maybe it's better with kids, but I'm afraid the kids I know are all these "modern" types who get bored and distracted really quickly ("Aunty, I think the game you painstakingly painted and built for my birthday is boring"). You know, not these little patient geniuses every BGG parent boasts about, who play (and win!) Settlers of Catan at age 2. This is all too bad, because the art is amazing.

Kudos for the artwork, it's very nice and original.
The gameplay is entirely opposite of that.  No meaningful choices and no interaction.  Their is little incentive to leave you starting port.
It's not a broken game, but it's dull.
I've might a played with the wrong rules.  Will need to play again to revised my rating.

Great little pick-up-and-deliver gamer's-filler with utterly gorgeous board art (made by building a model and photographing it). Players move a small fleet of ships around the Baltic Sea, picking up fish tokens which have to be delivered to certain ports. A space empty of ships or fish is replenished from the bag; drawing clock tokens advances the game timer.

What makes the game interesting is that, with each clock, players must set the end-game VPs they will gain for one of the types of fish (either 0, 1, 2 or 3VP each). In that scoring element it reminds me somewhat of Big Points, which I think is strictly superior (if much less cute).

It's a great, quick filler that I would rate higher if not for the strong impact of lucky fish replenishment draws. That drags it down to "like", not "love".

A neat indie game with beautiful artwork and simple but engaging pick-up-and-deliver mechanisms. If you're looking for a simple and short (30 min.) game in this style, look into it. The game isn't very original, but it's a pleasure to play.

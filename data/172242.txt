LIKE: Fast. Funny art.
DISLIKE: Random. Many take-that elements.
OVERALL: Quite vulgar, which I can see the novelty wearing off after a few plays. The game is not really my kind of thing, but tolerable to play occasionally.

What is the point of this game? The only reason this gets a 2 instead of 1 is the artwork. Buy only if you are a fan of the Oatmeal and want some artwork.

Note: on playing this, am very glad I returned the copy I purchased my brother for Xmas. He would not have been impressed.

You draw and play a card. It is basically it. If you draw a bomb, you explode unless you have a defuse card, and you are out. WIns who ever stays alive by the end. The artwork is extremelly witty and nicely done, but the gameplay is not as much as expected from an over-hyped kickstarter game.

Time bomb games are a lot of fun, and this adds a "screw you" component that offers an opportunity to get one back at the player that just damaged you.  It plays very quickly.  Read the rules again about how the "nope" cards work, because we played it wrong at first.  They don't stop the green save cards, which changes things up dramatically.  Elitists don't like this game, but they are lying to themselves.

Don't waste your money, I'm grateful that a friend bought it (she regrets the decision).  Played it  with a group of people who love The Oatmeal.  Game design incredibly boring, players lost purpose just to get it over with.   As for "NSFW",  just a series of poop, puke, piss, boob, and dick jokes seemingly written by a 5 year old.

12/28/15: To me this is a party game that I'd only pull out with non-gamers.  The artwork is amusing for the first 15 minutes but there really aren't that many different cards.  To me this is like a lot of other games I played decades ago, and there are so many other better games that have come out, even for people who don't regularly play games.

About 20 minutes per game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A decently entertaining game especially if you don't have much time. The NSFW version isn't suggested though. The regular version is just as funny and the NSFW version is just awkward sometimes rather than funny.

That one card with the dildo collection was funny.

Card art and titles of cards are cool.

Best thing about it is the box. No seriously, the box meows and explodes.

Everything else is garbage.

Game was never play tested it is honestly not even a game. Run, run away.

We seriously tried everything to fix this, we added more exploding kittens to try and salvage the 100 turns of quietly sitting drawing cards and having nothing happen (game suggest you ad exploding kittens = -1 # players in a deck of 60+ cards). Even adding all the kittens and removing the defuse cards couldn't help.

it is so bad. Please dont ever make me play it again

Initial Impression: I'm not a big fan of the artwork but the overall quality of the cards seems fine. I'm actually impressed with the box, which meows as you open it. That's fine attention to detail. The game itself is based on a press-your-luck mechanism with a fair amount of screwage. This game can get nasty quickly so players should be aware of that going into the game. My first play was fine and I can see it being used as a filler/evening ending game, although it seems to go on just a bit longer than I would like.

A ridiculously simple ruleset that somehow manages to overstay its weapon after 1 game.  It takes too long.  The one positive is that the cards are funny, however you never want to show people your cards (if you want to win), so you can't share the comedy.

These cards are funnier.

RATING: 5
Very mediocre game. Easy to learn and fast to play, so definitely a filler game. Good for when playing with people new to board games/card games. I especially don't like how this game is not really 100% compatible with the original edition. (You have pair cards without stats, with 2-3 of these you can perform actions like stealing other players cards, but if you combine with the original deck these pairs will obviously not match, which will result in players having really big hands and no matching pairs to play. If you combine with another NSFW deck, this will not happen. A rule could have been added to the rules book to avoid this.)

This makes for a good drinking game. Buy a few bottles of vodka, and give each player a shoot glass. When you explode, you die and have to drink your shoot. The survivor of each game does not have to drink. Game is finished when all but one player has either: passed out from alcohol poisoning. given up or when there is no more vodka (GET A LOT OF VODKA!). Enjoy!

Just... meh.  I kickstarted it since I was a fan of the Oatmeal.  Game always starts out with several rounds of drawing cards because there's no real reason to play any cards until the deck is about half gone.  

There really needs to be something added to this game to make you want/need to play your cards during the beginning of the game.  Imploding Kittens expansion sort of does this, but it's not enough.

10 for the great laughter what this game gave us. Not so much deepness in it but works really well with every group.
While I love the art I suggest to pick up rather the normal version over this for most of the groups.

I should rate 10 only the greatest games. This game is just not one of them 'just' a really fun one. Also there is a bit of cooldown after playing it for a year or so.

It's mostly poorly drawn obscene humor which was fun the first time but got old the second.  It doesn't have much substance for play, flip through the deck, sometimes play a card to screw your neighbor, but in the end whoever, mostly by chance, gets stuck with an exploding kitten loses.

A very fun take-that, press-your-luck filler game.  As I'm a fan of the Oatmeal online comic, I love the artwork, but others may think it's quite weird, and the NSFW deck is definitely more "out there" than the regular one.  We played with the regular deck and the NSFW deck combined, and if you do this, I highly recommend adding in extra exploding kittens cards, especially at a lower player count.  This game was more enjoyable with 7 and 8 players than it was with 4, where it seemed to drag since it took us forever to get to the exploding kittens cards.

Definitely a lot of randomness here, but it plays like Uno-on-steroids.  Fun for gamers and great for non-gamers, as it takes about two minutes to teach.  Lots of fun with the right group, but I definitely wouldn't want to play it ALL the time.

This game is more of a novelty item than a game and obviously designed to be so.  Going into this game I had very low expectations as this game is notoriously famous as being the Razzies-award winner for the worst game of 2015.  I was not disappointed.  But, I have to admit I laughed and had a good time playing with it.  But as a novelty item like the “100% marshmallows-0% cereal” boxes they sell in gag stores, I have no desire to ever touch this again.  I laughed because it was obvious that the creators clearly set out with the intention to make a game so horrifically bad… its good.  But watching “Plan 9 from Outer Space” with friends is a little different than playing a really REALLY bad game.  

You basically have cards in your hand: some with actions, some to collect (seemingly infinite) sets of types of cats (think Garbage Pail Kids-style) and you draw cars in hope of not getting an ‘exploding kitten’ card.  There are also many other rules that exist in the game without rhyme nor reason: they aren’t intuitive and trying to figure out mechanically why they exist is as pointless as this game.  The creators went out of their way to check off all the no-no’s of game design: No theme [check], No intuitive rules [check], no streamlining [check], Positive Player Elimination [check], no ambiguity in the rules/game play [check], no way of planning any strategy to win [check], no game ending goal [check], no way of know how long the game will last [check], really horrific and cheap artwork [check], poor quality card stock [check], a game that goes on far longer than it should [check].  It truly is an achievement that they made a game this awful.  

As a novelty game, I could see this as a hit with non-gamers and the general public that maybe play a game once every two years (if that).  It is there for a quick laugh (and its creators are apparently laughing all the way to the bank).

A game with simple mechanics for small children combined with art that is pathetically pubescent.

It's why I have no hope for humanity when "adults" enjoy something like this.  Very sad.

Hilarious card game that's great for a quick play. The art and flavor text crack me up every time. Good use of take-that mechanics. Randomness helps determine the winner a bit, though, since the bombs can be anywhere in the deck. This is a great party game if you have 2 decks.

RATING: 4
While the normal edition of the game is a light, fun game, this version is more or less offensive just for the sake of being offensive.  It really doesn't add anything to the game other than some immature giggles at some of the artwork the first time you see it.  About the only redeeming thing this version has to offer is the possibility to expand the original game up to 10 players if you really wanted to by combining the two.  I guess you could always run two smaller games at the same time as well since this is a fully playable stand alone game.

The base game I really like and have enjoyed introducing to new players as often as I can.  I guess I was just expecting a little more than was delivered with the NSFW deck.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
First off, the NSFW cards are very tame.

I don't understand the appeal. I love The Oatmeal but the cards aren't that funny, there is very little variety and there is no real humor once you've seen them all once. Gameplay is average to poor. The saving grace is how easy it is to teach to people. I suppose it can be a quick filler or gateway game.

This game is for the super casual card/board game player and I think it's not that bad as people say. I am biased towards this game since I am a fan of the Oatmeal. The game is overpriced for what it is and for the funding it got, it should have been a deeper and a bigger game. It has been compared to UNO and it has that feel. I prefer a game like Welcome to the Dungeon or Looterz for the casual/filler game but had fun playing this silly game. The humor and NFSW art is very novel and wears off fast but I do like the quirky artwork.

My wife and I received this as a wedding present.  Which makes sense, we like games, and cats, and I like explosions.  

It's solidly OK.  It's basically hot potato in a card game.  There are some decisions to be made.  It works as a pub game where people don't want to think a lot.

Although, we didn't play test this at all work slightly better in that department IMHO because of the description on the cards in EK either A, slows the game down as people read it or B people just stop paying attention to them at all and play cards purely based on mechanisms anyway.

Speaking of theme, I feel like this one goes out of its way to be NSFW.  It's not that I am offended, it's just that it sort of fails as shock value when every card is simply absurd and then the effect is worn off the cards are thematically tenuous at best.

BUT, I will say, it does achieve a very tense moment whenever you draw a card that will probably get it to the (pub) table occasionally.

Rating 4, because it's exactly the same as the base game, but with worse art and worse jokes.  The Oatmeal (the comic of which this game is based on, as you probably know) is at it's best when it's not trying to be raunchy.

This is also not really an expansion: It's exactly the same as the base game.  Just worse art and jokes.  Why didn't they add new ideas or mechanics? The base game is really simple, there's enough room for extra ideas.

Rated the original game a 6.  Rating this reskin a 4.  I like both the Oatmeal and simple filler games.

Love EK, slightly less love for the NSFW deck.  Doesn't do anything the original game doesn't already have covered.  The humor (to me) isn't any funnier than the base game, either.  There's a few cards that take it from slightly edgy to actually not safe for us to play at work, which is a shame, because we really like playing the base game at work.

Shock humour isn't something that gets me but the game itself is actually pretty good filler. The end game is a bit of a homogeneous arms race for the most defuses but the paths which you take to get there compared with how short the conclusion actually is make the game interesting for me.

Setup is kinda fiddly for how simple the game is.

In a two player game it bogs your hand down a bit with cards in the early and mid game, but it pays off at the end when you are madly competing to make sure your opponent picks up one of the instant death cards before you do.

As a serious gamer who has his spare map of Twilight Struggle pinned to his games room wall, I like it. 

It is what it is, a lite, simple, filler game with great components. I've found the games we've played of it have been enjoyable, with a unique sense of "rising tension" as the card pile dwindles. 

Going into the game thinking it is anything other than silly fun will lead to disappointment, but it's called "exploding kittens" ffs, what did people expect.

Initial Rating: 4.0 (May 2016)

I didn’t know anything about the game before playing it. I concede It can be a fun game to play with the right game group, but it is definitely not for me. 

The rules are ridiculously easy, you can explain them under 1 minute. The theme is amusing for some people, but it is lost on me. The artwork is good and amusing at first, but it becomes repetitive after a while. The Kickstarter edition makes a meow sound when opened and that´s “cute”.

Exploding Kittens is VERY group dependent. I have seen friends who have a great time playing it, and I also have seen groups in which the game was a disaster.

I find it to be an incredible obvious game with no brainer decisions in every play. Luck decides the winner and there is no way to mitigate it. It seems like a game out of the 80s (when I was a child). Very low replay value.

Very expensive right now. I don’t understand why it was such a Kickstarter hit, but I’m not familiar with the source material. 

The only positive I can find, is that it plays fast (but it is still way too long for what the game offers).

Bottom line, Exploding Kittens is a boring game full of meaningless decisions and completely random. Every game is decided by luck alone. I will do my best to stay away from it.

This is a hard one to rate fairly. I am a fan of The Oatmeal, but I did not back this game. It seemed way to simple for my gaming interests. The humor and art (while largely arbitrary, especially on the adult-themed version) is fun for a read-through. This, however, is a gaming site and so I must rate this as a game. 

"Card game version of Russian Roulette" is an apt description. You essentially have meaningless decisions to make in the game since you are limited to the decisions your hand allows and the outcome/impact of all of those decisions is random anyway (except for "Favors", but come on, everyone is going to give you their worst card). 

The game gets a "2" - which is what I give games that are full of meaningless decisions - but I'm boosting it a point for the fun art and theme. I don't think the game is worth playing once, but if you get your hands on a deck, it is worth looking through the cards, at least. Both versions get the same rating.

Russian Roulette, but with cards. 

Started off so strong, only to realize...it's not that big a deal. 

This issue here is that it's an elimination game with an obvious winner. If someone is holding off using cards, it might be obvious they have a diffuse card. What does this mean? A cat won't explode and it gets tossed back into the deck. Why does this suck? Well if you are unlucky and don't get diffuse cards (after your first one) you're sol. You could steal one, but still...it gets pretty boring and takes little skill to win. It truly is Russian Roulette and trying to dodge a bullet you can't dodge gets boring real fast.

Not a backer. Was hoping this would be a nice comedic filler to play with non-gamer friends to try and introduce them to the hobby. And to a certain extent it does that. But it really falls flat to me. 

Not a huge fan of player elimination games. 

I also feel like there are just not many different cards in the game. Only a few different actions and then just a few plain cards you have to set-collect to use. I dunno, I just feel underwhelmed by the the game.

Received as Christmas present from Rendell 12/20/15.

Great for parties of non-gamers.  This is 80% luck dependent, with some bluffing and a slight bit of card strategy.  Very easy to explain and the illustrations really pull people in.

This is not something I'd want to play multiple games of, but it works in crowds where other games like Codenames wouldn't.

It plays well.  Takes a full play through at least, to begin to see the strategy values of some of the other cards and combos (pair, 3 of a kind, 5 different, shuffle, etc) in placing and picking cards.  Also, after the first play or two players will be familiar with the rules and game and game play will be much quicker.

With 2 decks combined (or the regular+NSFW) you open up play to (6-9 players).

The only downside is the hard to read aspect of the cards text - the funny is just to buried in a tiny font to be front and center.  The NSFW has the funnier text (or more disgusting text).. and thats worth reading out as you play to add flavor.

I bought the expansion to support playing up to 9 players (I only really break this one out when we're having large sessions).

If playing with 6 players don't combine decks, rather use an extra Exploding Kitten from the NSFW in the base game.

RATING: 2
A pretty typical take-that card game with some random, and sometimes very strange, humor. I enjoyed the game well enough, but I was ready for the game to be over with long before the end due to playing with all the expansions. Some groups will probably enjoy this, but I would rather play Fluxx, Munchkin, Chez Geek, and many other games in this vein. I draw the line at Red Dragon Inn though.

Tem-Purr-A does the exact same thing this game does in a better way, albeit without the quirky humor, which, at times, made this game a little better than it would be otherwise.

A very simple, self-explanatory game. It genuinely takes about five minutes to learn/master, and after that it's quite good fun. The NSFW content is nothing to be afraid of; it's more a couple of juvenile boob/underpants jokes than anything of an offensive tone. Exploding Kittens is a solid way to game away half an hour. It wouldn't win any awards from me, but in terms of accessibility you can't argue with it.

RATING: 7
This is a simple game with limited mechanics. It normally takes 10-15 minutes to play and consists of each player taking turns drawing cards that may or may not be an exploding kitten. If a player draws an exploding kitten, they have to defuse it or they are out of the game. If the kitten is defused, the exploding kitten card goes back into the pile anywhere the current player desires. All played cards go into a discard pile and are not used again so the draw pile gets smaller and smaller. 

Though it is simple, it does provide several dramatic moments. If a player draws an exploding kitten card early in the game, they are vulnerable the whole time until they get another defuse card. However, the best drama is when it comes down to the last handful of cards and the probability of drawing that kitten becomes exponentially higher with every card drawn!

This version is Not Safe For Work and contains some explicit graphics and phrases, so be prepared to be distracted by the Bikini Cat.

RATING: 4
The rating for this game will most likely change when I have the chance to play it with its full complement of players. This game is extraodinarily boring with two or three players (the only way I have played it). I've heard so many good things about this game that I hope with five players it'll really show its true colors.

"Silly random game. Not much point to it.  The 'humor' was not funny."

What I like:
- It only lasted 25 minutes (which felt a bit long)

What I don't like:
- Player elimination
- Highly random play
- You can steal cards
- Tiny/faint text on the cards
- The NSFW stuff wasn't funny
- Long play time for what it is

This wasn't the worst filler I have played, but it's not a good one.

A simple card game without much to it, but I've played it on three separate occasions, with different groups and it went over really well each time. 
People are quick to grasp the basics and start to have fun.

RATING: 4
Pros:
1. Simple. A very simple card game, easy to teach, requires minimal thinking and converts easily to a drinking game.
2. Press Your Luck. I enjoy press your luck mechanics and this game adds that feature.
3. Art. The drawings are of course quite humorous given the artist.

Cons:
1. Quality. The cards are horrible quality. They started peeling at the edges after just a few games.
2. Old Fast. When playing this game it gets old fast. There's not much too this, so after 2 plays, you will be ready to move on to the next game.

Summary: A decent game for the role it's supposed to fill. Quick, light, easy card game. The art is funny at first, but even that gets old after a play or two. The game is cheap enough that it's worth a purchase if you enjoy his comics.

There are worse fillers but not much. It is faster than Love Letter, slower than Pairs. This game has some decision making involved even though it is a random mess and a shitty game. It is still quite fast(around 15 minutes). Personally I don't like the theme even though I'm not a cat lover. Unnecessary and bad humor on the cards drops the rating by one compared to the base game.

The gist of Exploding Kittens is to pray you never draw the titular card. Sure, you could steal cards and shuffle the deck in a bid to avoid said card, but let's not pretend that the decisions in this game are meaningful in any broad sense because there is just too much luck of the draw involved. At least the gameplay is redeemed by the quick playing time and the escalating tension as the deck gradually thins out. 

I also prefer The Oatmeal's "safe" humour, so the jokes here don't do anything for me.

Exploding Kittens is a fun party game that you can bust out when you're playing games with casual gamers. The game itself is very simple and easy to teach, but pretty fun. I usually get about 3 plays each time I bring the game out before everybody gets bored with it. It's a fun once in awhile game. The regular deck is pretty boring, but the NSFW one is quite entertaining. I gave it a 6 because of how long I can go without wanting to play it. But overall it's a good game.

So much humor in the cards and the game itself is just a lot of fun.  Got down to the final card being the final kitten and though I had enough cards to stave off death but my neighbor's wife had one more "Nope" card after all my defuses to kill me off.

I doubt this was ever intended to be anything more than a bit of a silly card game you play for cheap laughs down the pub. In that regard, it does the job amply.

Same exact game as normal kittens, just with different art.  Because it doesn't add anything to the game and the game does not play well with more than the base number of players, this is a useless expansion.  Still, Kittens isn't a bad game so if you give this to a friend you can treat it as a second copy of the game.

I just don't like this game. It got so much hype for the artwork because of The Oatmeal, but as a game, it just doesn't stand up for me, though I have only played 2 player. It's not a 2 player game at all. I don't care for the artwork personally (though it is good), the exploding cats isn't my thing, and I have many other card games with elimination that are more fun. That said, if you don't have much comparison, it's probably not a bad game, and you might like the vulgarity and gag humor associated with it (it's nothing close to cards against humanity but surely NSFW)

Really one of the shittiest "games" I've ever had the misfortune of playing. No decisions. Completely random. Atrocious artwork (I find The Oatmeal gross and juvenile, which is exactly why it's so popular in the United States, I imagine). It's also overpriced: $20 (in stores or on Amazon), for like, 60-80 cards. Light $20 on fire, and I promise you you'll have more fun than actually playing this.

Pretty stupid, but fast enough as to be tolerable anyway.  It's unlikely to take more than 15 minutes, and the cards are entertaining enough and the mechanics not so devoid of meaning that you can get through the game without worrying too much.  For groups that are fans of take-that games, this will have some staying power as super-light filler.  There's plenty of opportunities to screw the people over who you don't want to win.  The winner will almost certainly be some combination of the luckiest and the person who was picked on the least, so don't come looking for strategy.

Samuel L. Jackson said at one point while they were making Snakes on a Plane, they changed the title to something more generic sounding. He claims to have asked them to change it back, because it was a great title: "either you want to see that, or you don't."

So it is with this game. If something called "Exploding Kittens: NSFW Deck" sounds awesome, you will love this. If it sounds stupid, nothing in the mechanics will change your mind. I expected a few of the cards to be funny and it to be mechanically nothing special, and that's about right. 5 is probably too high for the actual gameplay but I had a fun enough time with my friends laughing at the cards.

Holy cow, if you like potty humor and bad language you will like this version of Exploding Kittens. Game play is fun. We got to the last card on the 2 player game. The funny part was with 3 cards left I was able to use the See The Future card. The last 3 were exploding kitten, and 2 Defuse cards. I then used the shuffle cards and drew one. Lucky me I got a defuse. Then the other player took a cards and got a defuse, that left the final card The Exploding kitten. Luck me I had 1 more Defuse cards than the other person. I won!

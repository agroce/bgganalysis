GAME: Pax Baltica
RANK: 2660
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.25
A significant improvement on the system used in Hammer of the Scots (and vastly longer!) . One thing I really like about Pax Baltica is the utterly different strategies the two sides must use: the Russians must be wary of combat with powerhouse Sweden, and try to get the Saxons and Danes to do the heavy lifting for them. The Swedes must pummel their enemies!......while avoiding being drawn into the Russian (and to a lesser extent Polish)  hinterland, where death and famine await. 

Complaints? Explanations of which nations are one's allies and how they are brought into the war (or out of it) could have been a heck of a lot clearer.

This is a failure for me, at least.

Bucket of dice, a lot of luck dependent events, boring and repetitious. I couldn't see the point. Sieges must be repeated from zero in case of failure the first turn. Too many RPs to play with, this is an evergreen attritional system. Way too long to play. I can't see myself play 80 turns of this boring gaming proposition.

I'm not even sure history is well served.

Sorry.

The quality of components contained in the game are outstanding.  But I feel that Pax Baltica, along with most block games, illustrates the shortcomings of the block design.  If you like swimming, imagine a pool where 5 feet, at one narrow end, is the deepest, while the pool itself is small.  You can have fun, but only up to a point; after that, things get rather repetitious.  Such is Pax.  There lies potential for a good game, but what is present is rather shallow.

RATING: N/A
Enjoyed, although it's a bit of an odd beast. The core engine is straight Hammer of the Scots, with dice being used to determine action points instead of cards. Very random and swingy with lots of chaos, this is a game about rolling with the punches, pressing advantages, and not getting run over when the dice turn against you. As a result, it needs to be long for all the chaos to feel like it evens out. Is there enough game here to support the ~10h playing time of the campaign game? Seems very unlikely - it'll get crazy repetitive. So it'll live or die on the shorter scenarios. The intro one is short (1hr) but really doesn't show off the game and feels out of kilter (replacement rates are so high you can essentially rebuild all losses every year). But it shows promise, so I'll try something meatier.

So, it's never going to be on the level of the better Columbia games using this system (Julius Caesar, Crusader Rex), and going for something long and chaotic is always a tough choice to make. But, it's a really interesting topic that doesn't get a lot of coverage. So I have some hope.

RATING: 8.5
PB is essentially the Columbia block model with some extra stuff included to cover a wide-ranging and eventful war on the wilder edges of Europe. There are quite a few special rules and lots of chaos which may cause a degree of blubbing amongst our weaker breathren. One should certainly not expect plans to come to a successful fruition most of the time, but after a while one begins to act like "The Last Viking" rather than a chess-player.

The games strengths are chaos and speed. However, its weakness is largely that it will fail to give a believable storyboard. Charles will spend far less time in Poland than he actually did. As a result a lot more combat will be in the narrow corridor from the Baltic through Narva and into Russia. The game is not aiming to be that historically based.

I've stickered the blocks and read through the rules. Seems like pretty standard block movement and combat rules, with a couple twists for foraging and navies, plus the garrison rules and minor powers.

My gut feeling is that it's probably too coarse to hold my interest for the full campaign, a whopping 88 turns if you play start to finish. I'm also not sure about using dice for actions and events instead of cards. But, I think it will be alright for the shorter scenarios.

Interesting block game derived from the Columbia Game school, but with it's own twists. Fast playing, it can be taught quickly as well. It is however a game that might be hard to master, especially with the Russians who seem to me to be at a disadvantage, at least in the first/short scenario. 
Played only the first scenario, but will definitively play the others soon.

RATING: 7
Having played some of the longer scenarios i've decided to put this one up for trade. It is a decent game but there can be a lot of filler turns and i'm not sure the game justifies the time it requires.


Unlike the other block war games i've played (Crown of Roses, Richard III & Sekigahara) there is plenty of room for manouvre on this map. Encircling your foes to prevent their retreat seems crucial as the Ruski's. The game also presents multiple objectives you need to weigh up. Do i want to maximise the chances of bringing Ukraine in as an ally? Do i want to attack my opponents recruiting areas? Do i ensure a reliable and well defended supply route? Or do i use my very limited actions to bring more forces up from the rears.

One comment i would make about this game against its peers is it appears to be really designed around the longer scenarios. The shortest scenario (1-2 hours) can be a lot of fun, but cuts out a lot of rules and maligns the event table rolls quite seriously. If you want a short playing block game, look at other titles.

2017-05-17 : solo-play to familiarize myself with the rules in preparation of an upcoming FTF play. Low block density and lots of space means this is a game of timing and maneuver and with tough decisions to make all the time - similar to the history really. The rules are quiet simple, but with enough period chrome. Combat seems brutal. Looking forward to what my opponent thinks of this one.

Good block game about a conflict not often featured in wargames. Combat system in the vein of Columbia games, chrome mainly based on the differences and exceptions applied to the manifold nations at war, and a supply system simple but effective.

Overall it's fine though it seems to be not a milestone of the genre.

For those who feel that Columbia has gotten a bit stale as of late this game will come as a relief. The rules have a few holes, but any veteran and reasonable wargamer can overcome these issues. My only concern is that Charles XII has little reason to play in Poland or leave Russia be after a Narva-level victory. Some of that is just plain hindsight, for we all now know that Charles XII's greatest error was underestimating Russia.

I want to see this system applied to the War of the Austrian Succession.

Interesting foraging mechanic makes superstacks costly. But you can still build a superstack if you are willing to accept some foraging losses. 

Boring units, mostly rated 1's or 2's. Swedish super-units (and some crap) against Coalition crap, basically. Even reformed Russians are still pretty crappy. Cavalry moves 3 but are otherwise undifferentiated from other units. (Including not being higher rated tactically. Many cavalry blocks are C's.)

Also, I question the economy here. Sweden builds for 40 each turn, and Russia for 32. (The Coalition also sometimes includes Denmark and Saxony at 16 each.) Sure, Sweden is at the height of her power here and Russia isn't, but still. 

The Russian part of the map feels small and constrained, with little room for the Russians to maneuver and defend in depth. Moscow is three steps from the Swedish domains. I would have liked some more provinces to the east of Moscow.

My mini review of the GMT version: A very well-produced game with wonderful parts. A better quality map than I expected with a very nice texture. Good blocks, a little thinner than the Columbia Games variety. Well written rules that seem complete. A Play Book with a lot of information including a historical overview of the Great Northern War. Play is brisk but there are 84 turns in the campaign game.

 It’s not a terribly complex game though a few more rules than say, Hammer of the Scots. Those rules are how different types of territories work with supply (forage), retreat and lines of communication. Also how the different countries operate regarding activation and special units. Also to be taken into account is the sheer scale of the conflict. The map represents about the same area as your average WWII East Front game and it’s 21 years of war. Consequently you can do less in the four seasons of the year than you would think. The situation is that the Swedish army of limited size tries to defend from attacks from three different countries of vastly superior strength taken together. The two sides, Sweden (plus sometimes the Ottoman Empire) and the coalition of Russia, Saxony-Poland and Denmark have the same chance for a number of activations per turn which tempers the numerical advantage. The Swedish army also has better units. Karl XII is almost unbeatable when at full strength. The trick is for the Coalition to choose their battles and attack Karl XII when he is weakened, preferably also block his retreat. 

All countries have strengths and weaknesses. Sweden’s strength is the quality of its army and number of replacement points. Its weakness is having to fight a three front war. Denmark’s strength is its fleet and the weakness the vulnerability of Norway. Saxony’s strength is the relative safety of the homeland, it has a crap army though. Russia’s strength is numbers and the weakness is that her south flank is endangered by a Ukranian uprising or an active Ottoman. Taken together it’s an interesting situation and I think history is being served. Charles Vasey thought the previous version lacked in historicity but I think this has been corrected in GMT’s version, there is incentive for Karl’s march into Ukraine for example, an increased chance for Ukraine and the Ottoman to activate.

Bottom line is I like the game. There are plenty of opportunities to try different strategies. I saw a comment that the game resembled Whack-a-mole in that Sweden must subdue its enemies and as soon as she has done so, they rise again (on a six!).

This is the first 1 I give to a game. Reason - total historical inaccuracy on the map. If that would be a fantasy game or something RISK like - that would not be a problem. But for a block war game that claims to depict historical situation in the region this is absolutely unforgiving. Lost country names, game designer acknowledging that he came up with names out of the blue to somehow name regions, incorrect language usage and just pure ignorance of the actual history. I do believe that the game itself might be great, rules perfect and etc., but as a person who knows history and lives in this region, I can't imagine showing such a map to anyone who passed 4 grades in school.

Enjoyable game overall.  There were a few areas where the rules weren't clear, but we were able to figure out a reasonable solution based on the rules and situation.  There are also a few situations that felt "gamey", but understanding that Pax Baltica is more game than historical simulation makes this an acceptable compromise.  There are a reasonable number of strategic choices to be made by the players.  Both of us learned the attrition rules the hard way on the first couple of turns! We played the 1707-1710 scenario, which was won by the Swedes on the last turn.  After an unsuccessful siege of Moscow, Charles and Peter squared off, with Peter's army block being eliminated in the final battle.

Original version.  The map is a mess with the provines FAR too small for the blocks.  Although the rules look simple and Columbia-esque on paper, in reality this game can get quite fussy, with dire forage limits and neutral countries that you can and cannot pass through and armies that have baggage trains, unless they don't.  This is all not NEARLY so annoying as the Events...players will pray they don't roll sixes for actions.  The Events themselves are usually irrelevant, but the cost in action points is severe.  I don't mind chaos too much as long as there is a trade-off in fun, but this is just sloppy designing. It's a really neat subject, but I want more flavor and less fiddly.  Is that too much to ask?
All that said, I can't wait to see what happens to the GMT version.  Hopefully that development team can fashion a diamond out of this underperforming lump of coal.

[Playtester, GMT edition] 

UPDATE GMT Edition: 

Certainly the most beautiful game GMT has ever made. It should be right up my alley, too, considering all the detailed work that went into this version. But with the forage limits, attrition, upgrading armies, replacements, and the dread Event table (out of 18 turns, 4 of them were Events (no movement), and three were “1’s”...one movement...and it could have been worse!


There are many grognards who will revel in the chaos the designers have insisted upon and rub their hands with glee at the comparatively laborious bookkeeping, but I am not one of them.

A nice block wargame covering the Great Northern War. Easy to learn, it comes with a beautiful map and nice materials.

A block wargame covering the Great Northern War.

Sweden vs. Denmark, Saxony-Poland and Russia

Great Northern war, a 21-year long war lasted from 1700 to 1721 and ended Sweden’s period as a major power in northern Europe and started Russia’s domination of Eastern Europe.

Shame though that the map is not a mounted map (board). Hopefully, this shall change in the near future. I would then consider purchasing it.

There is also some errata.
https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/907605/official-errata-clarifications

Also would like thicker sturdier blocks! Read the quote below.

[q="leroy43"] 
As noted before, I'm a big fan of block games, but one area where I feel Columbia Games outdoes GMT is that their blocks are thicker and sturdier. There is of course the natural tradeoff that thicker blocks mean that stacks of four or more become somewhat unwieldy and need a lot of real estate on the board, but the thinner GMT blocks, especially when you only have one block in a region, are more easily knocked over.

So far I have only played this solo. Although it shares some mechanics with the Columbia Block style games, it doesn't feel like just more of the same. There are always tough choices to make as you will never have enough actions to do everything you want to on each turn. Some of the attrition events are down right annoying and seem to hit exactly at the wrong time, however it ensures that no two games will ever play out the same. All in all a good effort and fun to play. 

Personally I think the solo rating for this game is too low...

RATING: 7
Wooden block strategic game of the Great Northern War. Since the war dragged on for over 20 years it can take a while to complete the full game, though their are early and late 10 year scenarios. Each turn represents a year with the Swedish forces of Karl XII holding the initiative and invading Denmark, Saxony, Poland and Russia in turn to stop them ganging up on him. The opposing player must try to hold him off while improving his armies and forging a coalition.

Took me some time to actually get around to playing, but I'm really enjoying it.

As has been mentioned, once you get the rules (mostly the special cases) down, the seasonal turns fly by. And that is good when you are covering a conflict as long as this one. Chaotic? Yes but not overly so and what chaos there is makes it more fun, at least for me. And no it doesn't exactly replicate the historical campaign(s), but what it does (for me) is capture the epic sweep, the ebb and flow, the sometimes dramatic reversals of fortune. 

Just a great game. Now I [i]really[/i] wish GMT would pick up [b]"A Throne Vacant"[/b], Three Crowns' take on the War of Spanish Succession.

Review after one playing. Interesting game of the Great Northern War based on the Hammer of the Scots chassis. I enjoyed the game, but it's clear that the dicey nature of the action and diplomatic subsystems makes this a highly chaotic game. The chaos actually gives it a very authentic 18th Century feel and may make it better history than HotS. However, many gamers will feel mortified when the dice pitches the game against them.

There's talk of trying to find a US publisher for this game. One wonders about the wisdom of this. Ported as-is with no changes many US gamers may not like the chaos. I can see how an American developer might want to add card play to make the narrative more predictable, but this would only distort the strategy and history.

Balticum Non Pacem?

Epic game--we played the full campaign and it went along at a nice clip, the game ending in 1716 with the Coalition suing for peace after some narrow escapes by the Swedes who managed to trounce Denmark almost immediately on their first appearance and then stem their tide on their second, a kind of coup de grace as it is difficult for the Coalition to do much without three active powers against those most bold and terrible Swedes.

It was fun creating a forward defensive strategy for the Swedes and implementing it in the face of many ups and downs of fortune. The game rang true, and an invasion of Poland was contemplated, although it did seem to make much more sense just maintaining what Sweden already had and using Ottomans and Ukrainians as occasional diversions.

A quality production, and I enjoyed it more than I imagined I would, but I'm not sure I'd rate this high in replayability.

Interesting game with a very dynamic alliance system.
But you need to like the action system.

GMT version, just a beautiful production. I'm somewhat surprised how accessible this title is. Has a few of the quirky items associated with most block games. Development is excellent, and the Playbook is a marvelous resource too.

Block wargame depicting the Great Northern War of 1700-1721. One side comprises Sweden and her allies whilst the other is a coalition led by Russia. Much of the game is reminiscent of Columbia block wargames where units have a number of steps that determine their strength (dice rolled in combat), which can be reduced and increased, whilst combat order and hit points are permanent. Where the game differs greatly is through the allocation of actions at the start of each turn where a dice roll has to be made and the result determines how many actions a side can take. There are several other features that introduce added levels of complexity such as military reforms, the introduction of allies, political events etc. The mechanics are solid (countless Columbia games are testament to this) and there's a real challenge for the Coalition player as they have to contend with Swedish forces of greater strength, but there is perhaps too much randomness introduced by dice rolling for the amount of actions available to a side. The game can become perhaps too difficult for a side (particularly the Coalition) if they keep getting one or no actions per turn whilst their opponent gets three.

If the topic is interesting, one might consider to buy this because learning much more new and have fun at the same time. It easy to lear and friendly for new players . The most important advantage of this game is a speed of playing: scenarios take seldom more than a couple of hours to finish.

My favorite wargame that I keep losing. It has a very peculiar rhythm to it, and captures an excellent "grand campaign" feeling. Much of the strategizing comes from accepting the losses you get and hope to outmanoeuvre your opponent on a fairly large scale. It's an interesting where the power balance is simultaneously precarious and hard to tip completely. Definitely recommended.

GMT block wargame, with substantially more complexity than most Columbia offerings. Slightly higher quality, too, although only just marginally. The rulebook is full color on glossy paper. The board is still unmounted card stock and even the box is a sort of rip of of Columbia. Hey, GMT, if you're going to do Columbia-style block games, at least do them with GMT deluxe quality treatment.

In any case, I had to have this game based on theme alone. A block game on the entirety of the Great Northern War, including the campaigns of Charles XII?! Hell yeah!

Have yet to dig into this one, but initial feels are quite good. Tentative rating, likely to rise once I've gotten a solo session or two in.

Columbia-like block games without cards but with sieges and politics. I didn't play the campaign yet but the scenarios were pleasant. Some randomness (activation rolls, allies), so those who prefer keeping a tight control on things should avoid or use loaded dice.

A good introductory wargame. Not many rules but interesting tactics that need to be used. The dice rolls for activations makes it very interesting along with foraging. It can be a very long game though and Sweden is very strong.

RATING: 9
Played 3 Times', a very good block game on the Great Northern War. And my rating of 9 is not biased. I really, really enjoy this game.

The good:
@ Simple set of rules, deep strategy
@ Turns are fast, low downtime
@ Enjoyable gameplay
@ Lots of space to manouvre
@ Tough strategic choices
@ Very interesting setting
@ High replay-value
@ Unpredictable

The bad:
@ Columbia games are better at designing blocks

Note: Some of the negative comments appear to have been made by people who did not actually play the game or totally failed to grasp the rules.

For wargamers with overloaded shelves, there's the nagging question of whether [i]another[/i] block game is really necessary. Despite my initial suspicions, I'll cheerfully report that Pax Baltica was worth the pre-order wait.

Warning #1: Pax Baltica is neither orderly nor clean. On the most basic level, you can't plan from turn to turn because you don't how many actions you'll get, if any.  It's wacky, and it's frustrating, but it plays against both sides equally.  So your opponent will be alternately hosed and ecstatic just as often as you are.

The chaos doesn't stop there, either (see below).  But that's OK. Pax Baltica goes completely overboard on chance, to the extent that you learn to give in and go along for the ride.

Warning #2: Pax Baltica is longer than most wargames that I play.  The mid-range scenarios, which will likely be our go-to games, can go for 5+ hours.  Four hours is usually my maximum, as that's the length that fits comfortably within a single evening.  But here I'll sit tight, fully entertained the entire time.

[i]How it works:[/i]

The number of actions per player (0-3, with 0 being an event) is determined by each player's 1d6 die roll. And oh man, you usually do NOT want an event.

Actions can be spent on reconnaissance (peeking at a neighboring group of blocks), group moves, siege declaration, adding steps to blocks, and rolling on the National Politics table.  Be warned: There is a 1 in 3 chance that something horrible will happen on the NP table.

Foraging (supply) capacity is checked every turn, not every year.  So maneuverability is limited by supply unless you're willing to overstack.  Which you should be.

Countries lose resource points (RP) - which are used for block builds - by having their territories garrisoned by the enemy.  RPs never go up, only down.

To receive replacements, blocks need a line of communications (supply line) back to a home province.

Area control is solely determined by garrison control, not by the presence of blocks.  This has subtle and horrifying consequences for retreating and regrouping.

After three rounds of combat, the player who must retreat is the person not in control of the space (garrison) - not necessarily the attacker.

Sieges are one-shot deals that do not carry over from turn to turn.  Also, garrisons have an intrinsic defense value; they aren't manned by blocks.

The map covers a huge swath of territory, from Denmark to the Ukraine.  In some games, you'll wonder why Poland was included at all.  In others, Russia will go inactive and Sweden will strike deep into Poland almost to the Saxon capital.

Allies have all sorts of nifty special rules that give them historical flavor. The entrance of an ally can be critical, but each ally only has a 1 in 6 chance of activating (or reactivating, if under a truce) each turn.  And when they [i]do[/i] activate, prepare for fun!

[i]Final thoughts:[/i]

Sweden has more RPs than it knows what to do with, and can be reckless with its vicious A-rated blocks.  The Coalition often outnumbers the Swedes in terms of blocks on the map and access to pressure points, but is severely limited by the number of actions rolled.  It's an interesting balance that is worthy of further play, and that's never a bad thing.

Simple block game with a nice smattering of period flavor. GMT will produce a larger map and clean up the rules. I'm sure my rating will only go up with the new edition, so I'm looking forward to it. Definitely worth the P500 sub if you're on the fence.

A very fluid and exciting game which has flavour of the era.

I'm shocked that this game can be played with the hours described in the playbook.  It is very unusual for GMT's games.

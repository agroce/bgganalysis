RATING: 7
This one takes chit pull to the next level and I like it a lot.  The map is busy but quite decipherable.  The rules are bigger than you might expect, but not too difficult.  The battlefield chaos is where this game shines.  If you ever watched a documentary or read a book about a Civil War battle and wondered, "if only ____ had happened.  Why did they do that?" play this game.

Still working on the rules, but from what I've seen so far, this version of the chit pull system seems to be really interesting.

A fairly complex wargame that plays so smoothly, it feels simpler than it is. The chrome is mainly implemented in things like event chits, not in extra rules (which is not to say that there isn't chrome in the rulebook). Once you get the hang of it, it moves right along. And despite the game's relatively small size, its chit-pull system and allowance for varying tactics make it quite replayable.

Note: I edited the rulebook, but have no financial interest in the game. I'm just happy with the way it turned out. :)

One play in of the short scenario, results were quite positive. I think this system manages to do a good job of representing general command and control confusion, while still leaving players in the driver's seat for the most part. Most ACW games tend to err on the side of either too much control or not enough, but this one hits the sweet spot.

The combat system is both unique and cool, where it uses a morale/flee check depending on how well you rolled rather than a straight damage system, with a different chart for close combat. Units can get damaged, disrupted, or both, assuming anything happens at all. It all "feels" right both in terms of the immediate results and the overall narrative that it generates.

Probably the worst I can say about it is the map, where it can be difficult to figure out what elevation you're on for LOS purposes. The lack of markers for VP spaces is a pain, too. Fortunately, the publisher is well aware of this and has made improvements in subsequent designs using this system.

Frankly, this system has pretty much killed any desire I had to play MMP or GMT's tactical systems which provide maybe 10 percent more realism at the expense of a rulebook that's 50 percent longer.

Played another wargamers copy...Overall a good and fun game. The chit-pull system needs some tweaking. Too many units turn after turn can be by luck or by forced choice doing absolutely nothing. Even after melee or shot at by the enemy. The artillery firing before all the rifle units fire seems really gamey. Since the players know this allowing them to avoid getting hit. Map is nice but is a bit too busy. Also, needs markers on the map where the VP hexes are. Other than a separate small map to decipher the main map. Lastly, there are not enough game markers.

As the game's developer I obviously like the system and although I realize not every game is every player's cup of tea, to say this system doesn't take into account unit integrity, facing or on-map command and control is to overlook the sophistication produced by the "Blind Swords" system.  

Yes, there are no rules sections labeled "Unit Integrity" or "Facing" but that's not to say they aren't taken into account. Just that they aren't an obvious feature. First, a player who breaks up his brigades will find his army lacks an offensive punch as only one brigade at a time is activated. So a dispersed force cannot concentrate as much firepower on an enemy as it might wish. Second, the Brigade Reserve Movement event only works for regiments that are adjacent to each other. so breaking up a brigade may mean fewer units get to the front line then you wish. Third, a unit only gains support when adjacent to units of its brigade, so a unit's morale will drop if it's alone. And a lower morale rating may result in fewer column shifts and a greater chance of breaking. So, yes, there are no unit integrity rules. It's just that bad things happen to a brigade that doesn't stay together. Just like in real life.

As for facing, first there is the concentric fire rule. But more importantly the players are taking the place of Stonewall Jackson and Banks. Does anyone think Stonewall Jackson concluded his orders with the reminder "Don't forget to face the enemy when you open fire?"

Now, considering the charge that the same events come up every turn:
1. Only a random half of all the random event chits are used every turn.
2. One drawn chit per turn is canceled, plus 
3. The drawn chits appear in a random order so at the end of a turn some random events are left unused.
4. A number of the random event chits generate a die roll. So, for example, in one turn a Union general is killed, 3 or 4 turns later a Confederate general is killed and a few turns after that the Union general that was reported killed comes back as he was only wounded. 
5. Brigades can fail their activation roll. So some units only fire, some only move, some only fire and move and some fire, move and assault. 
So how can this be described as the same events every turn?

As for command and control, the "Blind Swords' system includes the most sophisticated C and C system of any game on the civil war I've ever come across. True there are no on-board leader counters, but there are leader counters and a command system that plays an overwhelmingly important part in how an army performs. Is the physical location of a counter really more important than its function?

So, if the system is not for you, that's fine. No system can please everyone. Just don't say it doesn't take into account unit integrity, facing or command and control.

PS: Also a chit pull system is no more a Deus ex Machina than are dice or any other randomizing mechanism. As the old professor said, "you could look it up."

Seemed rather fiddly. Not very good solo (hidden chits); won't be very good by email (too many logs required per turn and interruptions). Map is... not to my taste visually and I found the elevation changes hard to read. Afraid it's put me off the rest of the series.

It's a really interesting system. I think I like it, but of course I need to give it a couple more run-throughs before I have a good feel for it. One interesting thing is that, because I had to restart a couple times due to seriously botching some rules, I can see how even this little game about this one little battle can play out very differently each time. The chit pull mechanic coupled with the special event chits can really cause things to branch out in different directions each time. So, I think there's a lot of replay value in this small package.

Lastly, I don't understand the complaints about the map. I had no problem using it at all (plus I think it's a work of art).

The map and counters are very functional and very good-looking. The system is completely new, and takes some getting used to, but once you get the hang, supports a very satisfying narrative. Compared to other systems at this scale (GBACW, MMP Regimentals) Blind Swords is a breeze. Not a 10, because I found the artillery rules a bit confusing (I posted a related question in this forum some months ago, and got some good answers in response). The designer and his minions are very engaged here and on CSW forums. Mazel Tov!

While this game system gets a lot of acclaim, I could not make myself sit down and play it. For a battalion level Civil War battle, there is little period flavor to the actual mechanics of the system. There are no formations, no facing, no unit integrity, no on-map leaders or command system... In short, there's little in the system to create the flavor and feeling that this is a 19th Century battle and not, say, WWII. You push counters around the board in any manner you wish, all subject to random chit pull and random "events" which function in my estimation as deus ex machina, a feature which some may find "thrilling".

Regarding these random events, they're all repetitive in that you keep throwing the same events back in the hopper to be picked again each turn. It's not like a CDG where cards played for events rarely get played more than once a game. If you like your opponents regularly playing Zeus and striking your units with lightning bolts from the heavens, with only marginal connection to what happens on the map, this is the game for you. The degree to which these events play a role in the game undermines the original appeal of player control in strategy wargames by injecting chaotic opponent-targeted sabotage into your ranks. Hence the name "blind swords" I reckon.

Now, this concept aims to recreate the apparent chaos in real life battles that often plagued commanders, so there's that; but in doing so it turns the game into more of an experience than a battle of skill, which is one reason some people play wargames. But make no mistake, the random event chits are the big draw of this game series. If that doesn't grab you, there's little left to draw you in.

Personally, the rules writing is fairly good, the counter art decent (despite some name errors), and the map is accurate showing appropriate features and the all-important elevation contours (although Barber's homespun art and lettering leaves something to be desired, unless that's your thing), but none of this pulls me into the period. Even though period chrome adds rule weight, I'd prefer that to this system that promotes the event chaos over the period mechanics. Others apparently feel differently. For this reason I still prefer the GBACW presentation from GMT for my ACW battalion-level games, and have little reason to go any further into this system. Compare all features of the Cedar Mountain battle in "Twin Peaks" with this title and you can see what I mean.

Great system but the battle is not as interesting as that in Thunder in the Ozarks. The systems was tightened up a bit in the next game along with the minor map problems (in Ozarks elevation lines are annotated and objectives are marked).

Very fun system, the designer went for chaos on the battlefield and has replicated it well.

Upgraded to 8.5, several plays in and the game doesn't get old!

For me it's the best regimental system for ACW. The rules are clear and the game is faster and more playable than GBoACW from GMT. The system is really fun and the Rick Barber's map very immersive. I will buy Thunder in the Ozarks and I hope more games in the serie after Longstreet Attack at Gettysburg. But please I would like a box version for all the games!
Thanks Hermann for your job and your support on BGG or Consim!

Beautiful map and counters.  The Blind Swords system very elegantly reflects the chaos & unpredictability of the ACW battlefield.  Excellent replay value - the system forces players to make tough decisions every turn.  The system is a real nail biter.  All in all, one excellent game!

Rules seem more complex when you first read them than they are because it flows quite easily once you get going. The map looks like something Clash of Arms would've published (that's NOT a compliment!) but like the rules, it also becomes second nature as you play. The beauty of the game is the game system that rewards boldness and being adaptable to chaos (because chaos abounds!). 

I like this game a lot and look forward to future installments of this system.

A bit difficult to get into (some unusual rules and mechanics), but once you understand the game it is very smooth and fun. 

There is quite a bit of chaos (events and dice rolls), but amazingly it all comes together.

Much better than GMT's GBACW, recommended!

Very enjoyable game, played it so much I had to order a set of replacement counters!  Chit pull makes this very solitaire-friendly and creates enough randomness to make every game play out differently.  I wasn't wild about the graphics as first... it's a beautiful piece of art, but I had trouble with elevations, etc.  After a couple of plays I got used to it and now prefer it to a more bland appearance as the "art" adds flavor!  Looking forward to any game created with this system.

Based upon the play of one play of each scenario, this is a very enjoyable game. 

It took me a few minutes to grasp reading the CRT results, after that, the rest was a breeze, almost second nature. 

Part of the enjoyment comes from the fact that I have been gifted with great opponents who play a challenging, but fair style of play, in fact everyone I've played in the last few years are like that. That way everyone learns, and gains from the play of the game.

I initially rated this game a "9". I've since changed it to "9.5" partly because of further play and partly to do what I can to offset Smjj. I dislike what he does on principle and will work to offset him when and where I can. He not only seems to universally dislike wargames; he offers no explanation for his ratings and he sometimes rates the game's prior to their release. It's all unfair, annoying and quite stupid.

Three plays in and greatly enjoying, chit pull system can produce a fair amount of civil war chaos on the map  as it should,( fog and fortune of war) but can be mitigated  somewhat by judicious use of saved chits .
Very good system, have just ordered thunder in the ozarks and will purchase Longstreet attacks as soon as released.

RATING: 7
Thematic area control game.

Yet another take on the area-control genre, but what makes this one work so well is it's strong theme, good scalability from 2-4 players (well it actually doesn't play too well with 2-players), and it's interesting multiple uses of the land plots/character cards.

You're goal is to have a presence (preferably first or at least second place) on different land plots in Egypt, which allows you to either: place a person in the museum (used for scoring multipliers) or take the land plot, which may or may not have bonus points associated with it, and which will definitely have a character associated with it.  The characters or patrons give you special abilities that you can use each round.  These patrons are also used for scoring- points are allocated for sets of each type, as well as for sets of the same type (this is where the museum comes into play).

This has a smooth, streamlined, well-designed feel to it, that along with the strong theme, makes for a solid game despite the fact that it's yet another area control game.

Own the [boardgame=30762]Nile[/boardgame] mini-expansion.

Mykerinos is for me what Louis XIV is to many people. I like Louis, don't get me wrong, but Mykerinos offers the same experience without the randomness that the mission cards and shields bring into Louis. It's a faster game too! I really enjoy balancing your activity between the expeditions and the museum. Too much in one area will kill your chances of a win. Additonally, Mykerinos plays quite well with 2 players, which means it's a keeper for me.

RATING: 6.7
Prototypical "super-filler".  Plays fairly quickly, enjoyable.

It seems to me that this game suffers from unbalanced roles.  The violet girl with +1 cube per season is way more powerful than the two gimpy "place more cubes on the board at once" cards.  My brown is useless later in the game, though the pyramid guy retains his tactical usefulness (it's always good to have one of him around).

Reducing my rating from 7.8 to 6.7 due to the obviousness of the choices you'll make.

A huge step up in the rating deserves an explanation...

Originally, I bought Mykerinos among the first 5-10 games I've ever owned, soon after Caylus, because it was an Ystari game. That time I found it to be just ok, while the constant blocking and extremely competitive nature of the game caused me to lean towards more player friendly games. This was true for my gaming companions as well. Thus, I decided to rid me of the game in an auction. 

Now in 2015, I found the game in the market for a decent price and nostalgia took over me. And boy, I have to say it was money well spent. 

Mykerinos was just as brutal and competitive as I remembered with the exception that this time both my and my buddies liked it. So, after 10 years of boardgaming it seems that I have finally grown to like the game. Rules can be explained in 5-10 minutes and the game plays in under an hour including setup and cleanup. But the best part is that every single move is significant. Every single move offers a trade-off for you to ponder.

I would not suggest Mykerinos to be played with newbies. Yes, it is short and simple but it really is a true gamer's game that does not reward casual play.

It's a quite abstract, fast paced area control game. Feels like an "advanced" filler. 

Better than expected. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.17
A good filler game for something to squeeze in under with under an hour to play.  Light strategy and nice area control.  Securing Sir Brown (which allows a player to put a cube in the museum during regular play) as an early patron seems to feel overly important after several plays--hence, if all players are not equally aware of this and there isn't meaningful competition to secure his patronage in the early game, then the player securing his patronage has a decided advantage (particularly if the same person collects several Sir Browns while other players have none).

Unfortunately, my youngest daughter (7) finds this boring.  My eldest (9) likes it, but I think the strategy of placing the cubes eludes her for now.  I find the game to be very  fun with lots of difficult choices to make.  I just wish I got to play it more often with adults.

I do find the cubes be to somewhat on the small side, every, the cards and very nice quality.

This one scratches the same itch as Web of Power: a game of influence

advantage of being luckless without being too predictable. It does not
look its part; the design is a bit boring, but the subtleties are
obvious as soon as your second turn comes up. Maybe, th best new game
release since Spiel 2005, but I have to play a few more games to be

Very simple, overall. The area control element of the individual dig sites was simple and did have some neat spacial / blocking elements, and then the other area control element of the museum for scoring.

I think I can understand why folks may think certain characters aren't balanced, but I feel having some of the various characters is important as well. I dominated the museum but still got crushed because I couldn't navigate the dig sites at all.

i'm with the people that seriously question the balance issues with mr brown.  getting into the museum is huge, and in 4p games whoever gets the jump on these cards seems to have a big advantage.  nobody wants to hand out cards in this game, especially a weakly-present 3rd place player, just to get set up for scoring.  i like the minimalism, the production doesn't bother me, i enjoy the cube play and all of that.  i just don't think the museum works, and i don't think the powers are remotely balanced.  in the process of testing it out further on mabiweb, and despite the shortcomings i find with the game i'm enjoying it.

A short, brutal and calculating area majority game with lots of blockage and denial. Plays quickly; our first game took 42 minutes, complete with rules explanation. People's reviews and comments compare it to Louis XIV, but I think it's just because of the placement mechanic. A good strategy is not immediately apparent, especially when it comes to counteracting some of the patron powers.

With three there was less blocking and someone ran away with the first turn. I need to play this some more, but Mr. Brown seems to be just amazing.

This is a bit of a sleeper title that is actually quite good, but flies under the radar of some gamers.  The basic play is focus on area majority, but it is spaced over three factors - the actual board used during rounds and the museum and benefactors.  The game has a nice balance between sophistication and game length (it plays quickly).  Highly recommended to play when you're looking for something with a little thought, but don't want to be locked in analysis all night. [GTI: AGSL]

Not a bad little game, but Mykerinos isn't anything special either.  I'm not a huge fan of area majority games (I only rate El Grande a 5), but this is definitely better than most I've played.

Pros:
The rules are easy to understand, and gameplay makes sense.  Deciding whether to add cubes to the museum or the board is a nifty idea, as is the fact that each piece of the board is actually a character that you can "tap" to grant you a special power (if you win it, of course).  Finally, it plays very quickly.

Cons:
My entire group felt like we were just going through the motions.  Perhaps I'm just sick of games where players just move cubes around and score them at certain times.  There was no excitement while playing Mykerinos; it's very bland, very dry, and there is no tension.  It's a solid game, and I'd definitely try it again, but there are more exciting games out there.

RATING: 10
I think this is probably the most satisfying 45min game I have. When I win I feel I really had to play well. When I lost I know what I did wrong. The way the board is layed out provides a near infinite amount of possibilities for game setup insuring you always have to play this game differently to win. F-A-B-U-L-O-U-S! Plays great 2,3,4!

I haven't been able to grasp it yet, after 3 online plays. It feels like a connection game, but with some strange majority and special power elements (or is it the other way around?). It's kinda fun, but not the great fun experience I imagined.

[UPDATE 2009-08-13] I'm starting to "get" it. While the theme is very nice, it has nothing to do with the actual game... the game is just an abstract with some "special" powers. That said, and that understood, it's a much more enjoyable experience than I thought. Still not my cup of tea, but a fun game and an elegant design.

RATING: 7
I recall reading that William Attia, designer of Caylus, claimed that that game was most influenced creating that game by Amun Re and not Keythedral as many people had thought.  Amun Re appears to have been an influence behind Ystari's latest release also, with the terrain cards resembling the Amun Re game board.First game was two player, not the best number.  Essentially an area majority game.  My opponent obtained several more terrain tiles than I did, including two sets, whilst I acquired all  (!) five rooms.  I won by one point.  The effect of the rooms, being multipliers, is easy to underestimate, much as the coral tile multipliers are in Reef Encounter.  Second game with three much better and all the patron's became more interesting, with Lady violet stealing the show.  Third game, four players.  Three and four both play well. Not as big a game as Ys and Caylus, in both senses of the word.  I was expecting more restrictions on the cube placing, for example across the cartouche, which would have led to a more tactical game.  Components (from Ludofact?) are top quality.  Minor criticism is the strength of the graphics under the rules making them hard to read.

RATING: 5
Mykerinos is quintessentially a Ystari game: dry, clunky, mechanics-focused. While I like the influence marker placements for area control and how the patrons affect the placement, I'm generally not as fond of how the museum and final scoring works. Players with brown patrons will be at a significant advantage in the museum and consequently in the final scoring. It is exceedingly difficult to come back from a deficit. I'm also not fond of the seemingly superficial passing rule where if everyone but one player passes, that player only gets one more turn. Consequently, players who have won purple patrons can get squeezed out if the other players pass early, thereby nullifying the advantage of taking purple patrons (which would have perhaps balanced out the brown patrons). In the end, the game feels like a lot of neat ideas were poorly cobbled together. Game play leaves me uninspired.

Good game, and inexpensive. Plays fast with hard decisions and combines tactic with some background strategies. It also plays very well with two players (special rules, with a neutral player but no fuss). Easily worth a rating of 8 for the quality of the  conception (rules/system), but the design lag behind (aesthetic and mnemonic/theme). Components are low quality and small, and the graphics are ugly and irrelevant. Not a big deal, but I am personally disappointed by these production decisions, as the game really deserve a better presentation/interfacing.

Mykerinos is a very clean and straightforward area control game, with perfect information.
It's an old school eurogame, that plays in less than one hour, and provides a reasonable experience.

There are four rounds, and every round player try to win the majority in some of the four (six in the last round) zones, placing cubes.
First and second (and perhaps third) will receive a character (helping in future rounds) or place a cube in the museum (for end game scoring).

With two players, there is a clever dummy player mechanism, working quite well.

A decent game, slightly dated (nothing fancy or new, no shiny graphics or components) but very solid and playable.

Very good twist on an area control game. You gain control on one board to score on the second board, however you have to make the decision for quick bonus points or potentially much a greater multiplier at game end. Also plays in 40 mins whilst being a mid weight game (I have put Mid Heavy but feel other may disagree). Also we have not found too much analysis paralysis.Will update after a couple more plays. After 4 play feel is a good game but it lacks something to give it a spark, try before you buy

This is one of my new favorites. Kind of like playing miniature 'Through the Desert' but with other stuff (the museum) to think about at the same time.

The components are a bit small, but I'm ok with this.

I really like Mykerinos. I'm terrible at it, but I really like it. It's basically 2 different area control games going on at one time.

I like it. This is a game that manages to feel like a much bigger game, but in a shorter playing time. Be warned that the rules are hard to get into, don't know why really, since the game feels really intuitive once you know how to play it.

A great little game. A meaty area control game with lots of choices that plays in under an hour. I'm really getting into these short, meaty games, and Ystari has a few of them (Yspahan, Ys with 3 players). I don't have as much gaming time as I'd like, so I love being able to play several short games that have the same feel as the longer ones. Played this with 4, and it was good. (It says 2-4 players, but the "2-player" game really isn't--it involves playing a fake third player. That's not a 2-player game!)

A fairly simplistic but somewhat fussy area majority and set collection game.  The limitations on cube placement (and your limited supply of influence cubes) can lead to a confrontational atmosphere, but you need to play smart (conservatively) and know when to cut your losses.  It helps to keep in mind that everyone tends to have a small number of cubes so the 1st or 2nd place prizes in some regions can be achieved with just a few cubes.  In the end, it's just too confrontational for my tastes, and I'm not fond of area majority games where you have so few influence markers that any small mis-play or even mild competition can be very damaging to your chances of success.

Didn't like this much at all. Theme is paper thin and game play felt dull, worse than that patrons didn't seem balanced, get ahead in the museum and the game is won - and you can do that quite early on. I'm sure some people love it, I don't.

I own this game and probably should give it more of a try. But, when I can predict the exact order players (4) will finish in after the first turn, when the theme seems (especially) pasted on, and the rules are poorly written (a running theme of the English translations in all Ystari's games) to the point players were getting impatient, i think it will stay on the shelf for a while.

4/24/06 - 1 play - 3 players. Initial reaction is that it requires more play to figure it out. One person ended up with two Mr. Brown's and basically locked up three of the top spots in the museum and ran away with the game. The mechanics of the game is smooth and quite intuitive and as is custom with Ystari games players aids are both on the main board and the patron cards so it's very easy to pick up quickly.

RATING: 5
When Ys first came out, I wasn't a huge fan, but it was a good shot from a first-time publisher, I enjoyed it well enough, and looked forward to what Ystari might come out with next.

If Caylus and Mykerinos is it, though, I think this is just not my brand. Mykerinos may in fact be the best of the three games, but the reality is that it's still dry as dust, pretty unoriginal, has a totally pasted-on theme, and is too long for its own good.

Still, pervious Ystari games had failings that hit you in the head like a hammer. In Ys, it was the fact that it was a blind-bidding game with a head-banging level of calculation required, not a good combination. In Caylus, it was the rediculous level of imbalance in the building costs and payoff and favor tracks. The good news is that Mykerinos appears, on first inspection, to be lacking these sorts of red flags. It plays quickly, is not too calculational, has a reasonably functional area-control thing going on (although it is gratuitously tactical when it doesn't need to be), and the obvious imbalance in the special powers is not terribly painful in this case, since the game is light. There is still awkwardness - Mykerinos wants to be light without giving up it's brand's "analytical" label, so you get both a slightly overwrought tactical game AND a card deck that can totally hose you. But really, it's not that bad.

Still, it's definitely not a "buy" for me. A lack of theme and an overlong playing can just be issues in an otherwise very good game, but either alone will break a game that otherwise is average. As they do here.

This is a good game, but it is super stressful. It seems to be all about minimizing the ways in which your opponent can screw you. And as the game progresses, your opponents options for screwage grow. I like screwage, but this is screwage. I liked it to a degree. But I'm really not a good spatial thinker, so this one is a big challenge. Would love to try with more than two.

Played one game of this as a (2-months) newbie to Euro games. I won it against two players, one of which was experienced. Overall, this was my introduction to "control" games and I love the basic principle. However, this is the first Euro game where I find myself actually questioning certain design decisions. I think some changes would have led to an even more elegant, dynamic game while simultaneously driving the theme further home. I need to play more games of this genre before considering it. But I can say without a doubt that I would examine carefully a second edition or remake/evolution of this game.

RATING: 2
Mykerinos is yet another area influence game in a somewhat new implementation of the genre, in this case, the "place pieces down, most present win something" sub-genre which contains Louis XIV and Leonardo da Vinci. 

The key concept behind the game is this: you place workers on a board to gain influence in one of five different patrons (suits). This influence does two things for you: firstly, it grants you special powers for the rest of the game. Secondly, it generates victory points for you. Decent so far. The problem is that the value of your patron cards is determined by a sub-board, the museum, and this can change individual patron values from their standard 1, up to 2, 3, or even 5. The museum board is interesting because it is where the most competition seems to take place, but my real issue with this game is that the person who wins the museum board in the early game seems to be all but assured to win the game period. There are 5 patrons, and in a 4 player game, both times I played it, the person who got 2 5 value slots was the one who won the game. The multiplier is so high, that having 2 different suits that one can get that large of a multiplier in seems to be the kiss of death for everyone else at the table.

As an offshoot of this, the patron that allows you to free place on the museum board (placing on the museum board generally takes quite a bit of work) was/seemed to be extremely over-powered in the early game as a result, and the person or persons who can acquire his tiles are likely going to be the ones to get the museum edge, and hence, win the game. I have since been informed that skilled play can mitigate the power of this patron (Brown) because it reduces the number of pieces the player using it has access to, but in all-virgin groups I would certainly consider this a problem, and the game wasn't good enough in my first outings to justify playing it more and upping our skill level, mainly because I find it dry. The special powers are not varied enough, and I would always prefer to play something like Louis, where player positions become strongly differentiated by powers, or Leonardo, which just offers a lot more bang with its long term planning and resource system.

Overall, a title that works, but I have had no desire to play it after my first 2 outings, hence the 2.

Wow. Love this game. 

Update after a few more plays. Initial high impression stands. It's interesting that, like Caylus, this can play very differently from one game to the next. Sometimes there is a massive battle for the museum which starts early, and final scores are high (~65). Sometimes people try to hoard cards first, worry about museum later. Those games tend to end with the museum less full. Winning scores in the ~40 range.

Great balance between tactics and strategy. Very little luck. Nice fresh take on territory control with sub-positions in the territories and flow between them. I really like that the mini territory control games are resolved four times during the game rather than the one big one like most games (although I like those too). The interaction of the museum and the special (but not too overpowering) abilities of the patrons really works well together. This is probably my favorite of the fairly recent 3/4 size games. Easily beating the Alea ones (including the new Augsburg). Maybe Louis XIV is on par, but Mykerison is a cleaner design.

While not an totally original design (majority, special powers), Mykerinos has a few intriguiging novelties. Quite cool is the second majority game you play—namely in the museum. You also play against time, because there's only 4 rounds of play, with the 2nd giving you special powers and 4th having 50% more playing area. Every twist and turn you could exploit has been blocked off very precisely. You [i]will[/i] follow the tortuous route set out by the designer. Yet surprisingly, it never feels overly scripted. The game works wonderfully for 2, 3 and 4 players; is relatively short, too; and comes at a very fair price. Game-technically, this is a clear '8'.

But.

But for that awful graphical design. The little pictograms are not very clear. The scoring board is too small: none of the player markers fit, they hang out over the edge. The cubes are too tiny. The player markers contrast very badly with the board; the graphic of the intrepid explorer should have been left out as there is no other visual difference anyway. The grid on the cards doesn't match up.  The more I play with the game, the more these flaws begin to irritate me. Therefore, a rare occasion: point deduction because of bad graphical design. Ystari needs to rework the graphics for a second edition to make them more managable. Then, Mykerinos can be awarded with the note it rightly deserves.

[b]Update[/b] I've bought my own set of new cubes and other things to make Mykerinos a bit more 'playable'. See [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/158530]this picture[/url]. I've also increased the note to '8' although I still think we should all receive free upgrades from Ystari.

Lots of tough decisions to make in this little game!  I think for the length there's more "fun" to be had with Yspahan but Mykerinos gives you some good brain burn in a very short amount of time.

Liked Caylus. Mentioned on dice tower. 
Got it now. Ill take a look.
UPDATE: played a few times. 6.5 What does work here is the "excavation" side of play. Fast, yet quite fun. Not nearly as deep as Caylus. Museum aspect seems heavy handed, over weighted and seems to make point collection via tile draws irrelevant. Comboing the 5x multiplier with specialization in one tile color is practically overpowered with little returns for blocking in 3-4 player game. I also dont like that the Brown tile bypasses the agonizing decision of wether to go for the Museum or not. Couldn't it have been replace one excavation cube of an opponent with your own? One thing I do like is that the key scoring aspects of the game are modular and thus quite friendly to house rule. eg. 2x tile scoring in second round, 3x in third, 10 points for 5 of a kind... these are the variants I would try. 

UPDATE:
Still brnging this to the table. It has good decisions and quick to play. The scoring is still heavily balanced in favor of the castle and it is had for players of dissimilar skill to produce a tense game, as in chess. Im gonn rate this one up to a 7.75. Higher if a scoring variant is used to increase the value of tiles plucked from the field. 

UPDATE: I designed a variant: multiply point value of tiles by round number when collecting this from the excavation. Cleanly addresses museum scoring issues I had. As a result, extraordinarily fun and satisfying game. 9.5

This game has a bit more strategy than most for a filler game. I enjoy the decisions that need to be made in this game. Can be subject to AP as some of the options can be difficult to weigh. Placing pieces in the museum at the beginning is a strategically important decision.

Fun little area control game, I worry that it is a bit unbalanced though.  (My first game did seem to be.)  I will have to assess on future playings whether this was just due to a lucky (or unlucky depending on your POV) tile draw.

RATING: 6

Archaology themed game of trying to get area majorities in dig sites so that your can claim help from different role cards. Get your artifacts into the museum and score there by area majority.

Works well enough. I was hoping that Pergamon would fulfill the theme's potential a bit better. (If they took the best elements of each of these games, there might be one really good game.)

RATING: 7
Mykerinos falls exactly in the same category of Louis XIV: a fixed-number of turns, variable power game, where new powers are acquired by winning (through a temporary area majority system) some land parcels. These "missions" are also how prestige points final victory are awarded.
It looks like some effort has been spent to streamline the rules and remove the much maligned randomness of Louis XIV. This has been done removing all kind of card and chit draws from the game. Now influence tokens are played directly on the "mission" cards. Since the influence cards are no longer available, a fixed capacity of influence markers is given for each plot of land. In order to make the game more interesting, a new level of complexity has been added in the final evaluation of "power/mission/parcel", mixing complete set collection requirements with single type focus, in a Kniziesque (and a little bit convoluted) scoring system. It sounds like a good game.
 
Will it replace Louis XIV? Probably yes, since it is faster but more gamers' friendly (thanks to the removed randomness). 
It is better than Louis XIV? I still don't know, because it might have some replayability issues.

Answer: No and No. Mykerinos is less fun than Louis.

I must say I quite like the game. The rules are simple and the gameplay is fast phased so you won't get bored while playing. Altough there seem to be only few good winning tactics, there are more than enought difficult choises in between preventing these strategies and building your own score stack.

I liked playing this... all the mechanisms worked well, the decisions were interesting and interactions between the various parts was good.
But each time I've played, its come down to who managed to get onto an explorer that no one else wanted. (Which can be influenced by who the tiles come up.) The multiplicative scoring doesn't seem to work well in a game where there's almost no incentive to take an explorer that someone else is already collecting (except to hand the game to a third player). This is a near miss to me.

RATING: 6
It's basic Ystari: an essentially themeless hodgepodge of mechanisms. Sometimes that sort of thing works for me and sometimes not. This one falls into the middling category. I'd choose it over Ys but not over either Yspahan or Amyitis, especially for a two-player game. Those latter two games lose little or nothing when played by two. Mykerinos somewhat clumsily introduces a neutral player (or at least neutral cubes) to make the two-player version work, and the result is just OK.

It seems that lately the trend in Euros has been going more and more towards games with excellent mechanics that work in every way you look at it, but which have a completely pasted on theme that has nothing to do with anything and which have rules because they have to have them so that they hold the mechanics together, but make no conceptual sense at all.  

Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Exhibit A: Mykerinos.  To be fair, Mykerinos is actually one of the better games in this niche, but it is essentially still just an abstract, and for an abstract it has too many rules for the depth it offers.  

Move along, (almost) nothing to see here.

I'm going to start this one at 6.  I think with a few more plays it will go up to a 7.  It is a little dry but fun.  While I'm not sure how much strategy there is to it, the cube placement gives the player some good tactical choices. It is a game where you hope that other players force resources out of another players hand rather than your own.  Ie they compete for majority on tiles that you are not interested in, giving you some cheap ones.  Area majority style game.

RATING: 4
Mykerinos was a fine, mostly abstract area control game. I liked it about as much as most light games (not very much), and would certainly be willing to play it again even though it did not thrill me. It wasn't bad. I just did not feel wowed by it, which seems to be the case with most light games. I wonder why?

RATING: 6
Players dig up bits of Egypt in order to win the favour of five sponsors.  A simple area control game where players sprinkle cubes into 4 by 6 areas of ancient Egypt.  Controlling an area at the end of a round lets you either claim a bit of land (flip it over to reveal a sponsor - Colonel Mustard sort of thing), or reserve a room at the museum.  Sponsors let you break rules in later rounds.  Scores at the end of the game are sponsors multiplied by their value (based on museum room value), plus bonus points picked up along the way.  Okay game in the Web of Power "light/heavy" mould.  Good gaming return for a small box game.

The compact playing area for this game provides both convenience regarding real-estate and tension regarding mechanisms. It's an incredibly tight area control game mixed with tough decisions in an impressively short amount of time. I forsee this game seeing tons of table time.

[b]8.2.10 Update:[/b] Officially added this to my top 10. The speed of this game is just too enticing.

[b]9.29.15 Update:[/b] Dropped out of my top 10. This wasn't because the game has lost any luster, it's because, for various reasons (theme, art, components, etc), it just isn't as attractive anymore and doesn't find the table often. I still love it though.

An enjoyable one-hour ish game filled with tactical decision, light to light-medium strategy, with a pasted on theme of finding artifacts for museum exhibition.

This is just another soulless euro (JASE), with blant artwork and horrific looking main board. All components are fine except that the scoring marker is tiny too big for the scoring track.

I thoroughly enjoyed my one play of the game. Turns are fast, the actions are easy to understand but critical in decision making. I love the cube management in the game; either you go all out to strengthen your presence in the current season or save some cubes for use in later season.

Kind of like 3 games in one, this is a clever game with a lot of depth. The learning curve isn't that high, but there are so many things to consider when playing that the possible strategies spiral out of hand. In particular, there are several ways to score points, and how they relate can be a bit obtuse during your first playing. However, we got the hang of it fairly quickly and the game to be pretty interesting. I'm not entirely sure if we were having fun, though.

The components are nice, and the tiles in particular. I'm glad they went with tiles instead of cards. If I have one small gripe, it's that the scoring portraits are too large for the scoring track, but it's easy enough to substitute a smaller object for scoring purposes.

This game probably deserves a rating of 8 or 9, except that I don't see it hitting the table that often. It's just not really my kind of game- a bit too abstract and dry, though the theme does fit very nicely. The character portraits are well done and a nice touch- kind of reminiscent of Clue, only better.

If you don't mind fairly abstract games with unusual scoring mechanics and multiple paths to victory, you might bump up my rating by a point or even two points.

7 év után kerül elő, még mindig nagyon tetszik.
H eddig nem? Hát ugye 4 személyes...
Egyszerű, világos szabályok, nulla szerencse. 
Terület foglalós. Egyiptom, ásatások. 4 idény, minden idényben egy ásatási régió, ami 4 kisebb területből áll, a területek pedig 2 telekből. (telek= kártya) A telek egyik felén a sivatag, az ásatás helye, a másik oldalán egy pártfogó képe.
a megszerzett pártfogó támogatják az ásatások szervezőit mindenféle extrákkal.
Alapban vagy ásatást kezdünk, vagy bővítjük az ásatásunk, vagy passzolunk, vagy párfogót használunk. A passz végleges passz. Holtversenynél az nyer, aki előbb passzolt. 
A lapkák -kártyák egyrészt ugye pártfogókat adnak, másrészt pontot is. De az igazán sok-nagy pont abból lesz, h a múzeumban kiállításokat szervezünk: 5 nagy szárny, az 5 pártfogónak dedikálva, minden szárnyban 2 terem, és van egy összekötő folyós is, különböző értékűek. A játék végén az egyes pártfogólapkák annyit érnek, amilyen a legnagyobb értékű terem, amit elfoglal a tulajdonosa. (2,3,5 lehet) Ha nincs abban a szárnyban embere, akkor csak 1 pontot ér az adott pártfogólap.
Ez sok pontot hozhat, szintúgy a sorok létrehozása: ha sikerül 5 különböző pártfogót szerezni, akkor az 5 pont, és ahány sor, annyiszor 5. 
Gyors játék, de jól összerakott, kiegyensúlyozott, egyik kedvencem.

Very similar to Louis XIV, but with less randomness. The powers won are slightly less interesting, but at least they're all available to all players. Also, there's less variation, since there are fewer powers available.

[1 play] I really did not like this game at all.  For one thing, it oddly felt to me as if there's not much/enough game there.  You do stuff that feels like it should be a preliminary stage and then it turns out that's the main (or sole) action of the game.  

More importantly, I found it really frustrating and annoying.  I'm struggling (in vain so far) to clarify in my mind what makes the difference for me between a game that's frustrating in an annoying way and one that's frustrating in a fun and interesting way.  One of the people I played with compared this to Blokus, which I like; they don't feel the same to me.  In Blokus, what I feel is time pressure on my choices--there are always (at least, till near the end) eight different moves I want to make, all of which are important, but I can only choose one on my turn.  In Mykerinos I didn't have the feeling of being pressed to choose between lots of good moves--more the feeling of futility in whatever I did.  Also, in Blokus, you fight to stay in the game until you reach a point where it's hopeless, and then you're eliminated.  You're either in it or you're out of it for good.  Not so in Mykerinos, where you play through the whole game but there's no assurance that anything you do will ever not be futile.  It would be possible--though of course not likely--to go through a whole game of this without ever scoring any points or winning any tiles.

Simple to learn. Just enough strategy and decision-making to keep you thinking carefully about each move. Random allocation of parcels makes every game slightly different. 

Best part: length of game is perfect in relation to its weight. 
Worst part: 'museum board' is badly designed, specifically: it's too small; counters don't fit on the scoring track (schoolboy error!); background design gives the whole thing a really messy feel. It just feels a bit like a prototype design.

Surprisingly hard majority game with interesting choices from the actions you can accumulate.

A nice little game that plays in just under an hour.  Do not neglect the museum, and watch the timing of the awarded tiles.  Try to be diversified instead of focusing on one aspect.

Good game, thinky and a bit dry.  Still I'd like to play it many more times. It's one of those games where you have to always study the board and evaluate each cube placement with care.  Yet it never drags since it's pretty short.  The no luck element makes it feel serious with lots of weight for it's size.  It made me want to play it more.  Not really my style of game but the short playing time makes all the concentrating possible without brain explosions.  Theme is just a wisp and the character names annoy me.  Otherwise very good.  A keeper.

Much more abstract than I initally thought it would be. The "excavating" is basically an abstract cube placement game. The way that it interacts with the museum placement, and the character powers are very cool and that's what really makes the game for me.

Solid game. Interesting decisions. Area control + set collection. Lots of things to balance. 

It works with 2, with use of a neutral player, but is much too tactical for our tastes. Much better with more. A little bit more abstract than I'd like. Doesn't see much table time, unfortunately.

Mykerinos is an auction/stock game disquised as a majorities/exploration title. I am confused to how this is so often to referred as an area control game, when it clearly isn't.  The cube placement on the parcels is really an auction mechanic which allows for blocking.  The winners of said parcels then either take the portrait, or raise the value of ones they already own by placing in the library.  With this all said however, I find Mykerinos an enjoyable little game which nestles itself comfortably between weight and time.  Temporary rating of 7, with room to grow.

My first impression is that this feels like a more streamlined version of Louis XIV.  To make some contrasts:

In Louis XIV, one really needs to keep track of his opponents' special abilities to perform well. Mykerinos players also gain special abilities, but they are limited in variety and are thus easier to keep track of.

Louis XIV is bad for three players due to a turn order penalty.  Mykerinos seems to work fine for both three and four (but Louis XIV probably scales better for two).

Louis XIV is fiddly.  Mykerinos is not (and sets up *very* quickly).

Interesting area control game - I like the abstract strategy element of placing cubes on the boards.  But the tiny size of this makes me long for the days when euro games were made larger than they needed to be.

Now that I've owned the game for some time, and finally played a 3 player, I've come to appreciate what it has to offer.

Elegant is the best word to describe the rules and the game as a whole. Easy-to-grasp, quick, for heavy gamers and casual gamers as well - and so compact.

Mykerinos simply took me by surprise and it was one of my best buys. Definitely worth having - especially for a euro-gamer.

The only reason I didn't rate it 10 is because in spite of its lightness Mykerinos is rather a gamer's game and you can't play it with everyone.

EDIT: Now it's a full 10 :-)

Area control games are a dime a dozen, but it is nice to see a good one pop up once in while.  The theme is pointless and really could be anything.  The Ystari artwork is pretty drab as usual.  If you like Web of Power or Mexica, then I think you would enjoy this game.  This game is nice and compact which is another plus in my book, although the scoring track isn't so clear and it is too small.

Continuing in my tradition of demonstrating how to play games wrongly, I managed to finish dead last in our first play of Mykerinos, an archaeological game named inexplicably after an ancient Egyptian ruler with a pyramid at Giza. It is reminiscent of another archaeology game but with none of the hopping around digging and collecting for exhibits. It boils down to area control and tile collecting, while attempting to gain the favor of five museum patrons who are able to grant special abilities for various advantages on your turn. What can Mr. Brown do for you? Well, he can sure as heck ruin your dig if you don't grab his tile early. This is one of those games that demands a couple of plays before really judging it. I started seeing the strategic lights flashing on about 3/4 of the way through, but, of course, it was too late by then. The patrons sniffed their disapproval of my archaeological skills and shunned the artifacts I brought to the museum. In return, I pocketed a tablet inscribed with some heiroglyhpics that I am sure outlines an ancient spell that will make me richer even than that old hag Mrs. Blackmore. I tend to like these types of games, so I enjoyed this one as well. Maybe next time I'll play a bit more intelligently. Or maybe not.

RATING: 7.5
Obviously Caylus and now Yspahan have a lot of fans, but Mykerinos is the only Ystari game that I haven't wanted to trade away after playing a time or two.  This is a surprisingly subtle and nuanced game!  I'm not sure why Mykerinos has gotten the tag of being a "lighter" game.  On the contrary, it seems to me to be an exacting, unforgiving game.  There's some pretty intense game theory (in the technical, math/econ sense) happening here.

Some have complained that Mr. Brown is too powerful.  My guess is that they're playing with four players.  I've played mostly with three players, and in that setting, Mr. Brown is well balanced against the other characters.  Having some characters that are a bit better than others is actually a good thing - it makes the game more interesting by differentiating the value of the tiles.

I had forgotten how enjoyable this one was until I looked it up again just now. You take artifacts and place them in different places around the museum to score different bonus points in your color, related to different patrons or something like that. I need to put this at the top of my play stack and try it again soon. I like most Ystari games - with the exception of Caylus - at this point. And the only problem with Caylus is it's too complicated and takes too long. Thats better than not being complicated enough I suppose.

I've GOT to get some more plays of this because of how much I LOVE Louis XIV. However, my first play was very underwhelming. I much prefer the use of cards in Louis to Mykerinos placement rules. Introduces luck, yes, but it also gives me something to think and strategize about when it is not my turn.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
One play. It was very interesting but not really that fun, and I'm not sure why. Maybe the problem was this: it's commonly accepted that having difficult choices is a good feature for a game to have, but the difficulty ought to stem from there being different paths to travel, each of which is tempting in its own way; Mykerinos has difficult choices, but to me the feeling was more like "you're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't."  I like games that occasionally let you have a satisfying turn, even if it's only in an incremental way, but every decision in Mykerinos left me asking "am I going to be regretting this somewhere down the road?"

I like the cube-placement abstract game inside. I'm not sure it's worth crunching through the outer layers of privilege drafting and jockeying for spots in the museum for, but I'm not sure it's not, either.

(I hear this is typical for Ystari? Nice, solid B+ Euro games. I think the time when I'd treasure that may have passed by pretty quickly and now be gone.)

RATING: 7
Nice game, but it didn't grab me in any way. The quality of the production could have been a little higher: for reasons unknown did they decide to create a couple of special cardboard counters for each player to track scoring and tie-breaker instead of simply adding a pair of extra cubes. Unfortunately are the counters to large for their spaces - or the board too small - in any case something that should have been cought before the game was sent to the printer.

Mykerinos goza de fama entre nuestros aficionados como un buen juego, como tal es correcto, pero su desarrollo es plano.

With a third game, I think we can now speak about "typical Ystari fare"; a game running smoothly with balanced mechanism, quality bits, clear and concise rules.  Once again nothing original maybe, but beats most of the games it emulates. If you want a fast area-control game, it is the best choice.[edit]Although an equally nice game with 2, 3 or 4 players, it gives a very different feel with different numbers of players, so much that it is worth mentionning. What I mean is that if you do not like it as a 2-player game, you should try it with 3 and four, and vice-versa
[edit] finally I put the score up to 8: maybe the game seems to be quite humble, but this is really a very good area majority game I am always wanting to play

good as a 2p game.  More tension than expected!
-----

Update December 18th 2014
After a few additional plays on mabiweb -- I think it's fair to say that Mykerinos' biggest contribution to area majority games is the spatial placement element which makes it all the more difficult to plan what you might be able to get, and plan blocking other players out (with a little help from some friends). This will never be my favorite area majority game, but it does something interesting.

[Initial Impression: 8]
A relatively quick, yet quite strategic game with elements of area influence and variable scoring.  Thematically, it works well and the tension rises during each season as players compete for influence in various areas.  Equally enjoyable with both 3 and 4 players, and the 2-player variant is nicely tense (passing becomes agonizingly important with 2). This appears to be effective in hooking new gamers - I think it is because of the lighter "feel" combined with the tension of having consequential decisions.

Yet another interesting take on area control from Ystari. It's significantly more chaotic than Ys, and it's hard to recover from a bad first turn. Still, a good game.

As far as production goes, it's sad to see such component quality tied to suspect graphic design. Some symbols are hard to see without good lighting, the main board is too dark compared to the text, and the manual's background makes the rules hard to read. The fact that they keep making the rules in landscape doesn't help.

イスタリが元気だったころの傑作。エリアマジョリティ+陣取り+得点化。マジョリティのために影響駒を置いていくが、その置き方によって他人の駒の行く先をブロックして陣取りも併せて行うことになる。マジョリティを取ることでパトロンを得るが、さらにその得点化を行わねばならない。最終ラウンドだけがマップが広く、しゃがんでいた人が逆転できるようになっていたり、毎回最終的には全カード出るようになっていたり、マジョリティを取るだけでなく得点化が必要で、そこも早い者勝ちになっているところなどとても理知的なデザインになっている。

If played with others who know the game, a full playing can be knocked out in around 30-40 minutes.  Despite it's short playing time and limited choices, it packs an awful lot of punch.  My favorite mechanic applies to how majorities are obtained.  During this stage of the game, it takes on quite an abstract feel, asking you to look at the current parcel you are interested in and figure out the best way possible to place your cubes in a way that limits your opponents placements.  I'm down to play any time this hits the table.

First played this on Setember 17th, 2007.  This is a quick learn (~5min) and quick play (~45min).  The balance seems tilted towards the strategy, however it works with the game.  We played as a 4 player game.  After one play, a couple of the characters seem to be more useful that others.  Your objective is to collect tiles to gain points in the auction house based on where you have your displays setup.  I'd strongly recommend giving this a try if you know some who has it and give it consideration for purchase and placing in your rotation of games to play on a regular basis.  Update: as a three player game, it seemed like there wasn't enough competition and the player who picked up a certain couple of cards had the inside track.  Perhaps too much of an advantage.

Mykerinos is duller than sawdust and as boring as filling out your 1040.  It also seems to have a substantial runaway leader problem (although the one game I played we had misread a rule that changed the placement of cubes significantly).  There really didn't appear to be much anything of interest to me anyway, so I'm not sure I care.  Almost everything appeared to have been stolen from other games and stitched back together to form this unimaginative and totally inoffensive title.

Game that is very much in my wheelhouse in terms of simple mechanics (part area control / part abstract strategy / part classic Euro resource optimization), yet requiring smart play.  Note to self: That Sir Brown seems like a strong patron to have in your corner.

Was pleased to see that this had been implemented at www.mabiweb.com.

Update:  After several plays, becoming a little less enamoured of the game, as there seems to be fewer successful strategies than I had initially anticipated.  Still like the abstract strategy nature of the game though.

I've got a a bit of a mixed opinion on this one. It's a solid area control game with a bit of a stock element thrown in (which I tend to like). But gameplay is really dry.

I have now played Mykerinos five times. The rules are relatively straightforward, but there are a number of interacting mechanisms at work and various ways to earn points. This creates plenty of scope for tactical play and also rewards players who engage in some longer-term planning. The theme seems rather awkward, but Mykerinos is a fairly abstract game and sufficiently interesting not to need a rich and well-integrated theme.

RATING: 7
Area influence:variable player powers:

initial rating could rise slightly....

Seems to scale well 2 - 4 (2 by far the weakest configuration)but 4 is definitely best, excellent game, quick turns that are still quite hard, fun, lots of screwage(lots of cursing in game), very low luck, simple and clean rules, strategy and tactics both in good portions for a 45 minute game. The only question could be in the replay which remains to be seen and something I will find out as this will be hitting the table again soon and often... 

[u]UPDATE[/u]: There is a lot of fun packed in this 45 minute game and some good depth as well. Looks like it borrowed from Louis but it feels different enough to own both. 

[u]UPDATE[/u]: Played again years later and felt a little flat compared to before.

The quality of the components is extraordinary. The theme is poor, but this is an excellent area control game. The various mechanisms (cube placement, room reservation, patron tapping) all work well together to give players lots of choices in the way to play. It's short, and very competitive. One of the best short games for 3-4 players.

Played two two-player games and one four-player game so far and had a good time. I wasn't sure an area majority game would work with two players, but the "neutral player" variant makes this challenging with just two. The game isn't heavy or rules, but challenging enough to be interesting. My rating might go up after some more plays.

Just keeps getting better. Have to balance your choices and also analyze/predict what other players are doing in certain areas (do they want a parcel, or do they want to place in the museum so that 3rd or 4th place you may still get to claim a parcel).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A surprisingly simple area control game that nicely balances trying to get what you want and trying to stop other players from getting what they want. I like the tension between deciding to take a parcel and going to the museum. Going to the museum is really a matter of timing, as you want to claim the good spots, but you don't want to reveal which point groups you're planning to grab too early—but it becomes obvious if you wait too late! Really love this game—the artwork and components could use a touch-up though.

Very good area majority game which plays quickly. It's definitely a lighter game than Caylus is, but since it plays in a fraction of the time, this is not a bad thing. Interesting cube placement mechanic (not trivial at all, as some have claimed) and a nice balance between getting cubes to a dig vs. to the museum. It does seem that a strong museum position at the end of the game is essential for victory, though.

The game has held up pretty well to repeated play, and I don't think my rating will change much in the future.

Compact German-style game (although it's actually French). Don't let the wooden cubes used to influence different game mechanisms put you off if (like me) you're not exactly short of games utilising cubes. Some nice features: in each of the 4 rounds you have 5-10 turns to play cubes onto tiles of 5 colours/suits that you can pick up at the end of the round if you have the majority. Tiles picked in previous rounds give you different advantages in later turns depending on their suit (my feeling is that it's best to go for brown early, although you'll need a mix to win), and are also added to your score at game end. You can (and should) also place cubes on a suit multiplier track that (if you play it correctly) can greatly enhance your game end score - easier said than done. This synopsis probably makes it seem a little dry, but to me it hits the right spot for the German/French games where player interaction, tough decisions, attractive components and reasonably quick play time come together to give a very enjoyable experience. Good price, too.

An area control game...not my favorite type of game but of the AC games I've played this one is one of the better.  The rules are simple enough and it plays out in a decent amount of time.

This game is brutal.  It's a two player game that really doesn't play well with more.  One missed score and you never seem to have the ability to catch up.  No 'fun' at all.  If you end up on the short end during the first turn (usually because of Mr. Brown), you might as well give up any chance you have at winning because you'll never be able to combat the special powers of the other players for the rest of the game.

In each of the games I've played so far, the person to get the first Mr. Brown patron, won.  Mr. Brown is WAY too powerful.  Using only ONE cube from your personal supply to get a choice spot in the museum doesn't seem to offset the use of this patron.  And if a player manages to get TWO Mr. Browns in the first turn, you might as well start the game over... you'll never catch up.  I'm not saying that the game is BROKEN, but it's close.

I thought that Age of Steam had inelegant scoring... this one takes it to a new level.  As a multi-player game, this only rates a 5 for me (and I think I'm being generous).  I doubt that I'll ever play this game with more than two players ever again.

One last thing... whoever said that this game was 'fast-moving' has obviously never played with our group.  The AP and downtime are almost unbearable.  A 45 minute game that takes 2 hours to play!

One last comment... why were all of the components for this game made so small.  From pictures, I thought that this was a full bookcase sized game.  Imagine my surprise when it arrived.

Cut costs by shrinking the components... and then reduce the typeface of the rulebook to 6-7 points which my old bifocal-clad eyes can barely read.  I ended up printing an 8.5X11" large copy.

"Best Game in an Hour"  Little downtime and constant tough choices - where to dig (focus in area or spread out?), which character to choose (can't let someone monopolize a character or else that 5 spot in the museum becomes awfully powerful) and museum placement (go for 5's or be content with 2's and 3's) are all key to doing well.

I've enjoyed my playings of this game so far. It's really resource management/area control. Deciding what to do with your resources is the issue. I would have thought the game would bog down as players tried to determine what their best course of action would be. But that hasn't seemed to happen and the game is clocking in around 45 minutes. It's a race for museum space and the best backers for your expeditions.

An engaging little burner. It feels like every game is designed to be close, which makes me wonder if there's much overall strategy to be employed, or if the game is only reacting to the situation on the board. I found the museum placement scoring to be a bit strange. I feel like those who score first have a definite edge, which is my primary beef with an otherwise good game.

This game seems to start slow, and then end very suddenly. One really doesn't have time to build up much in the way of special power cards before the final round is happening.

I really dislike the components for this game. The cubes are too small. The point markers are too large for the scoring track. The "paintings" on the cards are comic-book style. With better components, I'd probably rate this a point or two higher. Yup. I'm shallow like that.

RATING: 7
Plays very quickly and entertains the whole time.  Enjoyable theme and lots of interesting decisions to make.  There aren't too many games that you can play in a half hour and feel like you've actually accomplished something, so this one really stands out.  Over time, I'm thinking that 4 is the best number of players.  2 is not so good, especially since both sides play a dummy player that doesn't do too much.  But in order for some of the special abilities to have equal weight, you need the tightness and competition for space between 4 players.  With 3, there's too much open space.

RATING: 7
A fairly straightforward set-collecting game with powers. Players use cubes to bid on tiles and then try to make their tiles worth more points. I would've liked a cleaner museum phase, because it felt a bit clunky and tacked-on. Overall a pretty good filler.

A really smooth game that I see as slightly better than Louis XIV which fills the same niche. This is faster, there's less luck involved and this looks better. I'm not sure of the balance of the magnates though. Also five 5-point rooms in the museum could ruin this game in the long run, if it appers to be so that the player getting two of those in a 4-player game (almost) always wins.

This game involves taking majorities on tiles (sort of bidding on the tiles, really). Winning the majority gets you that tile along with it's special power to use in future turns. The tiles score points at game end according to how high you have rated them in the museum.

The Good: A good and underrated game. Lots of decisions, and it only takes an hour or less. Good amount of decisions to be made from choosing which tiles to bid for to choosing when to take time away from the tiles to raise values in the museum. I think this will make a good family game, but have not tried it with the family yet.

The Bad: The rules could have been written better - the first 2 people that taught it to me, both played it wrong ! It ruined the game both times.

Fast area control game with interesting tactical and strategic choices. Very low on luck, but the random placement of the 36 terrain/patron cards during the four rounds and the different distribution of the patrons among the wings of the museum at the start of the game ensures replayability. Nothing really innovating regarding the game mechanisms (except maybe the dual use of the terrain/patron cards), but the different elements blend very nicely together into a fun game. Only minor point regarding the production: the player tokens are a bit too big for the score track.

A nice little middleweight game with lots of board tactics concerning cube placement (area influence, card sets & powers) and museum (scoring) placement.  The trick in gaining victory points is that a major part of your score is the multiplication of both role cards collected AND museum multiplier (x2, x3 or x5) areas.  I really love the innovative & novel approach to the tactical, quirky cube placing idea on the backs of the role cards - really cool and my favorite aspect of the game.  An excellent two player game with both players controlling a neutral color (2p rating is a "7").  After several plays, I don't see a high desire for multi-player replays of this b/c there seems to be an optimal strategy of getting Mister Brown early and placing a cube in the museum (Mister Brown gives you a role card AND allows you to place a cube in the museum, which is a "double boost" that no other role card can match - so getting 1 or 2 Mr Browns early on is an extremely strong lead).  However, this is a fabulous TWO Player game and my rating for 2-players would be a 7 or 7.5 b/c you can counter your opponent more easily than in multi-player.  A case where IMO, this game shines more as a 2P than 3P or 4P game.

Definitely did not find playing with two very satisfying.  I've left it rated a "5" until trying it with more people to see if it improves the game.

There is a nice majorities game here with characters that give you powers to break the rules. There are some very tough decisions to be made, and the game can be over before you know it. Ystari wins 3 in a row (Y's, Caylus, and this one).

RATING: 7
A simple area majority game that has some depth. You place 8 or 12 tiles out to create a board.  You can start an excavation with a cube from your personal supply or extend an excavation by placing two cubes.  There are pyramids that "block" on the tiles so you can cut off opponents.  When everyone has passed you determine who has majorities on sets of two tiles.  The first play can choose the tile or place a cube at the museum which is important for end game scoring.

I really like the game.  It is simple to teach and somewhat abstract.  The game has ok components.  Rules are well written but stupidly written over a hieroglyphs image which makes them almost unreadable.  But other than that a solid Ystari line.

Atypical game. Feels as light, but has a lot of tough decisions to make. Nevertheless, plays pretty fast. Lots of interaction on the board. Remarkable how so many game mechanisms are packed in such a simple game. Area control, majority, character cards that give you extra powers and collection building, including share value improvement. Great game !

Having played several times now, I'm pretty impressed with the ease of play and the quality components.  It's original enough to stand apart from other area-control games, but really shines due to the quickness of the game.  We can usually play in under an hour, which is prefect when we're looking for a filler.

Now this shows how bidding games should work. Herr Doktor Knizia could learn something, and I say that knowing he developed Ra and Amun-Re. My point is that, great though those games remain, he's kind of worked over the same old mechanisms in a hundred different games and they're all a bit bland and repetitive.

In Mykerinos, I love the land parcel bidding; the tough choices when taking sponsors for their benefit actions or gallery spaces for points; the decision to drop out of a round early to have more influence in later rounds. It's pure Ystari genius.

RATING: 7
At first, I heralded Mykerinos for being an excellent heavy game in short play time - but after a hiatus while playing loads of different other games, I find myself not returning to it because it is somewhat dry and obtuse. A bit forced in how the mechanics are laid out onto the players, so to say. While there exist distinct short term, mid term and long term benefits to each move, I do not see as of yet if this will eventually all lead to a satisfying, fun gaming experience (where I can clearly see with hindsight what strategic choices were specifically strong, or weak), or just a mish-mash of mechanics intertwining to some fuzzy addition/multiplication scoring mechanism, where there are just the tactics of the moment and stuff just ends up some way or another. The above may also strongly depend on the amount of players involved. Writing these comments make me feel stongly that I should be trying to get at least 5 games close to each other under my belt soon, to see where my definitive opinion on Mykerinos is headed.

UPDATE: A few more games further, I can safely say that Mykerinos is a solid game. However, some of my feelings above still hold; if perhaps a bit more mildly. I still find the amount of interesting decisions in the short game length impressive, but I do think the game has some limitations that hinder the overall enjoyment. I am, for one, still not sure whether the timing of moves can be manipulated enough to force significant point differences. I also do not feel I have enough proficiency yet in planning the combination of card ability and museum locations - this may either improve or turn out to be a rather chaotic, overly tactical element of the game.
In short, I am still having fun with Mykerinos, because any elements that are seemingly annoying or (may become so in the future) are mitigated mostly by the short play time. Should these elements become more prevalent over time then I hope the expansion can help fix this. For now, solid but not top tier.

It should be noted that the components of Mykerinos are needlessly fiddly; the chits for score tracking are too large, and the cubes are way too small. I cannot imagine the publisher having playtested this game and nobody pointing this out. If it bothers you too much you can always replace these components easily with some stuff from some other game though.

Neat little area-control game that plays pretty fast. Different from most other games out there, which I liked. I would have preferred at least one more round of play, to give time for the "special powers" to really have an effect on the game, although that might have made the museum too powerful (I guess they could've always reduced the value of the museum displays to counter that).

Elegant area-control game.  The cards are great: one side of the cards depict a pyramid rich area in Egypt where the area-control portion of the game are played each round.  The cards form a small board divided into either 4 or 6 connecting areas where players place cubes to try to gain majority in their chosen areas.  Players who win the areas have a choice of moving into a spot in the Museum (which provides a multiplier to scoring at the end of the game) or taking the cards. Once you own a card you flip it over and you now have a character which can be tilted each round (to use it's special power). At the end of the game these characters (each with a different colour) provide victory points equal to the multiplier you have for that colour in the Museum.  (Moved rating down a half point as already I'm feeling it may not have a great replay value.)

An enjoyable area-influence/control game that focuses on competing for spaces on tiles.  The players who win the tiles can choose to either take the tile into their hand (getting points and special abilities) or reserve a room in the museum (which gives point multipliers for specific types of tiles, depending on location); choosing whether to forgo a tile to get space in the museum is an agonizing decision.  The game has many interesting mechanics (ties for each tile's influence are broken by who passed first) and presents the player with many difficult decisions.  This game is not too complex (e.g., decisions seem somewhat easier than in Louis XIV), but it does have a lot of meat to it (unlike, say, China).

[i]Mykerinos[/i] proves to be a pretty brainy little Euro. The cube placement part of the game, while not engagingly thematic, is nicely challenging. I really like the pass early to gain a tie-breaking advantage rule. By the 4th round there seems to be an over-abundance of special powers via the patrons. The little museum is cool looking, but again lacks thematic flavor in terms of gameplay. Own but have yet to try the Nile expansion. [2 plays]

A solid if very dry experience. To me, this game is simply a balancing mechanic dressed up as an abstract. It does have a very Chess-like feel to it as you fight for area control on the excavation areas, and knowing when to get cards versus moving into the museum is interesting, but there isn't much else going on with it. This is the first older game from Ystari that I was pretty disappointed with.

Acquired July 25th, 2008 - New

Love it!  Reminds me a lot of Louis XIV, but I like this one much better.  After you figure out who has majority, you either place a cube in the museum or take a card.  Not a hard choice, but causes some AP in the game.  The cards help you "break" the rules of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
In Mykerinos, you play two different area control games: one to claim assistants (who also give special powers) and one to claim spots in the museum (which increase the points earned for each assistant). A third game in the game is the pass order, where an early pass saves you cubes and gives you a better tie break order.

I think this game of "increase your area or increase the value of your area" is slightly more engaging in other games (Santiago, China, The King is Dead, Carolus Magnus and Sheepland are some examples) but Mykerinos does stand a comparison with them.

Mykerinos is a very clever game that packs a good amount of decision making into a short 45 minutes.  I really like the mechanic of choosing between taking a location tile, thus giving you a special ability and potentially points, and using your first or second place finish to go to the museum, thus actually giving your location tiles worth.  It's a very tough decision, and is the heart of this game.

Though I think Mykerinos does a good job with its area control mechanics, it is another area control game, of which there are many.  Also, I have some concerns about the balance of the character abilities.  With more plays, I will likely change my rating, but for now its a solid game, and a good super filler.

In this area control game, play cubes on tiles representing artifacts.  First and second place winners of the tiles get to keep the tiles, or play into the musuem. Tiles represent one of five personalities which give you special powers, such as placing  more cubes. Score points by having cubes in the museum, matching the personalities that you have.  This is quite a good game, with a mix of area control and tough decision making. It plays fairly quickly as well.

Unique theme. Both boards are important. The problem is that you really need to go to museum and get 5s for at least one of the category. But if you do it too early, you will not get those cards. This is a nice system for short game but not for one hour game like this one.

RATING: 7.5
Textbook definition of an abstract area majority game. Very good if you're into that category of games - but it can feel a bit dry to those not in this congregation. Feels a tad too short, and thus that there is a fully-control-your-own-faith element missing. However, good under the hour mark area control/majority control games are very hard to come by so this one fills that gap nicely.

RATING: 8.9
Very simple and fast, but a lot of strategy in this ystari game.  I really enjoy the characters and the way the museum interacts with you choices.  It is never an easy choice.

Everyone thought the are-majority mechanism was boring and over-done. Along came Mykerinos, which packs such an elegant game play into a small box. It is very simple and straightforward when compared to, say, El Grande, but it works very well.

Fun little Egyptian-themed area-control game. The excavation theme is worked into the game rather well with patrons supporting your excavations and, in a since, awarding you more points for collecting their areas. 

One of the goals here is to have a majority in a particular area of excavation; which allows you to keep a "patron" card (which gives you small advantages in subsequent rounds and a few points) or open an exhibit in the museum (for points at game end). When you are finished with a season (round) you Pass, after which the other players get 1 more turn. Passing comes into play for tie-breakers on the majority areas.

Plays OK with 2 players, but is better with more. 

Played this with the family recently. Can't remember who won, so let's just say I did. Take that, History!

One of the Ystari games that I enjoy. Acquire tiles by achieving majority in cubes placed on them. Acquired tiles give special abilities dependent upon tile color. Cubes also can be used to enhance the value of acquired tiles, which are scored at game end. The game plays in an hour.

A difficult game to get good fix on. You need to collect cards, both to gain points, but also to get the special abilities. Using your blocks to claim the cards seems to be a bit more important than claiming position in the museum.

This simple game manages to pack quite a bit of depth without a lot of fiddly rules or unnecessary elements tacked on, but it takes longer to play than it should (normally 60 to 90 minutes rather than 30 to 60) and it is rather bland.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A rather refreshing take on the very crowded genre of majorities games, Mykerinos doesn't merely use majorities for plain scores: each round of play a modular board is built, and the player who's placed the most cubes in each of its areas will decide if keeping one of the two tiles that build it or placing a cube on the "museum". The tiles, when kept, give extra points and allow players to carry out special moves, whereas the museum is a little board that determines how many points players can score if they posess tiles of a certain kind at the end of the game.

Even if this reads like one more twist on the usual majorities business, Mykerinos is actually an easy game to grasp - every element in the game seems to make sense. The modular board and the flexible configuration of the "museum" allow a huge amount of setups and the different possibilities to move give players enough leeway to try out different tactics without being afraid to lose a bit of edge (that can't be regained later, that is). Obviously the player who either collects loads of tiles or fills the museum quickly will have a comfortable win, but players with even skills should bring out a tense and rewarding game in about 45 minutes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A game that you think cannot possibly work, but it does. Swift and efficient area-control in 30 minutes and, although it features much of the worst push-and-shove of area control games, it resolves surprisingly well. Relatively little fuss for an Ystari game, as well.

Nifty little area control game.  Lots of good spatial decisions to be made here, you want to place in ways to claim the tiles that are important to you, while trying not to get blocked, and trying to marginalize other peoples' positions when possible.  The cards add some interesting abilities, but I think Sir Brown is too strong.

First impression, excellent area-control game. Immediately thought of El Grande (of course), and Louis XIV (of course). I think I will like this game more than more than either. I am concerned about the power of the "brown" character based on Geekbuddy analysis. Putting at an '7' based on two plays. 10-9 picked up at Essential Comics on Exeter, PA, on trade for about 150 1980's era comics. 11-12 After second play, brown role card seems to be devastatingly powerful. I've won two games big based grabbing these early.

Just one play.  Suffers from the inexplicably popular El Grande Syndrome; place your own little wooden cubes and hope other people don't place their little wooden cubes nearby.  Now pretend that this is fun.
Like El Grande, has HUGE kingmaking potential, since the scoring contains no hidden information.

The strength of Mykerinos is its simplicity; it's very easy to learn but there is depth to this largely tactical game. It may suffer from a runaway leader problem as the player who acquires the most patrons on the first turn has a snowballing advantage. The theme is laughably tacked on and this detracts from the game. The patrons' colour-coded names are silly and the board unattractive and bland.

A bit of a dud - wanted to like this game.  Fun and original theme.  Very reminiscent of Louis IV, from gaining curry and using favor of patrons, majorities (1st & 2nd) and other elements.  Easy to forget a couple of important points (taking points when claiming an excavation, and claiming rooms in the museum.

Nice variation on the area control core mechanic.
Bits are both too small and too big. The cubes are ultra tiny (are there tweezers in the box?) The cardboard discs for each players identity are too big for the score track. Different size cubes of the same color would have been a better choice.

The individual region strategy is nice simple and straight forward. The card collection as a modifier is also pretty straight forward but not as simple. Recognizing that more cubes to the board first isn't always as good as dribbling them out one at a time to wait out other players after the first round when cubes are more scarce.

Needs a few more plays to surface more of the strategy.

Pros:
* Plays surprisingly well with 2. I haven't played with more, but I really really liked how spiteful you could be when placing the neutral color cubes.
* Strong player interaction via blocking and area majority.
* Quick setup
* It would be perfectly viable to play the game without patron powers and turn this into a more simple abstract.

Cons:
* Dry as a bone. Standard "we can't think of a theme so let's just make it about something in Egypt" fare.
* I can't quite describe why, but the rules made the game seem way more scary than it was. Maybe it's the tiny font or the busy patterns.
* Did I mention the game was dry? Within minutes of playing the game, the narrative (if you can call it that) had already evaporated. I remember my play of the game, but only in the abstract "I enjoyed it and would probably enjoy it again" sense. Contrast that with the 2nd game we played this evening (Isle of Skye) where we spent a good 20 minutes discussing which tile was the game winner or our strategies for setting tile prices or what our maps looked like or any number of things that created a progression of interesting experiences. There are no "remember that one turn where you did that awesome thing?!" moments in Mykerinos.

Neutral:
* I'll have to play it more before determining if the game would feel too similar from play to play. The random placement of the pyramids creates a bit of a "map", but there's otherwise very little variability.

= 2015-10-22 - R:7

Going to start right off with a 7 on this game. I usually like to play at least twice, but this one impressed me. For all the comments I made about the game being dry, that's actually a pretty weak con for me. We also love Aton, which is another "Let's just make it about Egypt" game.

I've mentioned this before, but one characteristic I like in games is when a strong position leaves you vulnerable to a strategic counter attack. Examples might be hording of resources in games like Finca or Alien Frontiers or grouping up lots of cards of the same color in Babel. In Finca, if I'm due more of a type of fruit than is available, we ALL have to give them back and as the hoarder, you both set us for this and you suffer more from it. In Alien Frontiers you make yourself a target of the Raider's. In Babel a big group of the same color card sets you up to be able to use a power many times, but also leaves you vulnerable to cards that make you discard all cards of one color. I like how this limits the "rich get richer" problem while letting you push your luck a bit.

Mykerinos has a little of that. I thought I was doing really well by getting the 5 spot in the museum for the orange color and then winning lots of orange patron cards. The power of this card was also going to allow me to spam the boards with my cubes and then pass early. But it turns out the various powers in the game are quite situational. Sometimes it's hugely important to be able to build on a pyramid. Sometimes you'd kill for the ability to start an excavation with two cubes. Sometimes - or a lot of times if you caught on to what I was doing - you get your excavation sites blocked over and over so you can't even use your abilities.

Collecting lots of patron cards gives you lots of powers, but it also leaves you vulnerable to getting blocked out of the good spots in the museum. Going after the best spots in the museum means you're not taking patron cards so you risk not having the powers you need to win the patrons you need to get points from the museum. The game forces a nice balance.

RATING: 6
The upside:
- Area-control twisted by some characters super-powers.
- You try to build influence in several layers (escavations, museum, characters).

The downside:
- It's a bit dry, but well...it's in a desert.
- And a bit of an abstract.

Played once not fully understanding everything. Now that I have a better idea of gameplay I may raise my rating after I play it some more. Played my second(or)third game and have a better feel for play. I came in 2nd in a 3P game, 62-50-46. I'm liking it more. Upped my ratings. 

Played my fourth game today. Ended up being a three-way tie (out of four) for points at 39. Only one person had a cube left over, so they won. I didn't think I would be anywhere near the top, so I was happy. The third player could have won if he had played in the museum differently.

Seems like an ok game, and I suspect it's probably very good for 3 or 4 players, but it shouldn't claim to be workable with 2 players.

first off, this has to be one of the ugliest games i've ever played. the graphic design of this game is truly some of the most uninspired i've ever seen from a major publisher of eurogames--not to mention that the choice of pieces and markers are also pretty boring and hard to see. (although i'm sure the graphic design was handled by ystari, and not rio grande, but still . . . ) these problems would be minor, if it were not for the fact that this is a pretty dry area majority game. the bad graphic design conspire with the dry game play to make mykerinos a pretty underwhelming gaming experience. not a horrible game, but not one i'll ever be dying to play.

Area control games are my favourite, and this is as good as Louis XIV. Nice amount of control and the placement of cubes on the map gives it a good tactical feel. Another winner from Ystari - probably the most consistent game company around.

This is a really good area control game.  One of the best of that genre.  I love the agonizing decisions you make in a fairly quick playtime - do you increase the amount of scoring tiles or the amount of points  you get per scoring tile?  Do you take a tile that will give you more points right now or one that perhaps has a more powerful ability or just an ability that you currently lack?   Great game.

The epitomy of "euro" in a bad sense. There is theme, but it never makes any sense. This game promised to be interesting: it has a lot of component sub-games, but each of them fell just short of delivering enough excitement. Works but not gripping and towards the top end of complexity for family play.

RATING: 7
Interesting blend of placement decisions are presented in this game.  There are a lot of different mechanisms merging together but they do so in a pretty smooth way.  There's definitely a learning curve to play well, but you won't be totally out of contention your first game.  There's a good deal to think about, but it isn't too hard to grasp at the same time.  I've based this on one play, and suspect my rating could move after further tries.

(When rating games I focus on the "how likely I am to play this game again" part of the BGG description rating, as opposed to the "quality" part of the rating.)

LOVE this game. Lots of fun decision making. One complaint is that the marker tokens for the score track don't quite fit on the score track spaces. I use glass beads instead but it's a shame because the rest of the components (both material and art) are great.

Semi abstract area control. Place cubes on a set of drawn cards ("excavation" areas) and try to gain a majority on each card to claim it. Taking a card (gaining the support of a "patron") facilitates future excavations in a variety of ways (depending on the patron) and also acts as a multiplier for end of game scoring, encouraging set collection. Instead of keeping a captured card, players may instead opt to place a cube on a central board (the "museum"), which contains limited high-value spots that factor into endgame scoring (along with with the collected patron cards).  Somewhat in between a filler and a deeper game, with marks of Ystari design (including the passing track) noticeable throughout.

Reminds me both of Go and El Grande. Cubes are used to attain majorities in different regions, and can be placed to make it more difficult for other players to do likewise.

Surprisingly interesting as a 2P game.  Nice area control game to gain bonuses to gain control of more areas.  Have played multi-player game a few times as well, and get a similar, yet different feel to the game, but still appears to be a fun game.

The theme is a bit thin as one is just playing cubes to get area control to get points/benefits to gain more area control, but the game appears to be balanced enough that it is the accumulation of small benefits that appear to yield the winner.  And it plays quickly for another benefit.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The game works fine, but nothing grips me.  The early game is a bit arbitrary.  The mid game is a bit spite-based.  The late game is a bit forced.  All phases offer some choice, but none feel particularly tense, clever, or distinctive.  So, ultimately the game is forgettable but inoffensive.

Mr. Brown is a bit too good, given the somewhat arbitrary manner in which the tiles can come out and how turn order influences who gets the advantage in certain grabs for power.  That sometimes sorts itself out, and sometimes randomly gives one player a huge advantage.

Randomness in how the tiles come out is perhaps the biggest problem in general -- if the tiles you need get clumped, you lose.  If they are nicely distributed and other players don't happen to compete over them, you win.  If neither of those thigns happens, then the game is interesting.

Aside from a weak theme, this is a decent area control game with 2 definite levels of strategy to it.  There are some tough decisions to make and you need to formulate a strategy for points while maneuvering tactically during cube placement.  

I think the unintuitive theme here makes the game suffer and it becomes ultimately forgettable.

 I really like how the area control mechanism is done here. You do your best to position yourself every season, and at the end of the round, all is reset and you can start workimg again. There's role selection, set collection, and yes the Theme is brushed on but I don't care about that. For me, a game succeeds if the mechanisms are good, and if a little theme exists to give you an idea of a setting, that works for me. I went ahead and got the Nile expansion to go with it. 

02/25/15/: Nile expansion is solid, although not essential imo. It adds a little more to think about and the new patron is a good counter to Lord Brown. All in all, glad I got it.

I've only played this game with two players.  I want to rate it a 7, but honestly it's not fun enough to warrant that rating.  It's not a bad game, but it's too much thinking.

Mykerinos is an area control game with elements of resource management.  Players are digging through the dessert sands of Egypt, gaining patrons, all to display their findings in an exhibition at the end of the game.  Each player will gain workers at the beginning of the turn; whatever they do not spend they keep.  The game board is made up of modular tiles, each with 6 squares.  Two tiles form a region, and at the end of the turn the player with the most workers in a region gets first pick of one of the two tiles, or may go to the museum to reserve a room.  Each tile represents a patron who grant various powers.  At the end of the game the museum acts as a multiplier for the patron tiles x1 being the default, and growing up to x12.

Players must carefully choose where they want first place, second place, or not place at all.  The last turn of the game adds an extra 2 regions to the board, so conservation of workers is advised.  Players must also keep an eye on the museum and reserve rooms in accordance with the tiles they have or plan on winning.  This adds tension as the decision making becomes more strategic as to which regions you want to take a tile, and which you are willing to pass on in order to go to the museum.

It's fast paced but deeply strategic.

It's appropriate this is set in the desert, because it's dryyyyy. It was okay, but there was zero excitement...zero "fun." I appreciate that it's a short game, but that also creates a situation where it's absolutely unforgiving of mistakes; there's no time to fight back. Plus, if a couple of people gain supporters early, they're going to be cleaning up every round. 

Also, in our 4-player game, 2 people were handing the other one "free" tiles by sending people to the museum. (I'm not saying they were colluding or trying to help the other.) Since there's no way to guess or anticipate whether a person will send people to the museum, it's a crapshoot, and it was frustrating to watch "free" tiles get handed back and forth. A definite "meh" for me.

A tight design that distills an area-majority game to its bare essentials, which can be a hit if you like the pee-wee conflicts or a miss if you don't like I-placed-first-so-don't-fight-because-I-win arms races (I don't). The museum makes this interesting, as you have to balance between attaining more majorities and the end-game benefit of increasing the value of your majorities.

Mykerinos -- Played twice; four-player. 

Lord Lemon is clearly less useful than the other patrons. Conversely, Sir Brown and Lady Violet are very powerful and useful. Archaeologist cubes are in short supply, and Lady Violet is hugely helpful in that regard. Museum placement is key to scoring, and Sir Brown allows you to place cubes in the museum, bypassing area contention. The other two patrons are useful, but because they use more cubes, they work better if combined with Lady Violet's advantage (in order to offset the faster depletion of cubes). This is not a complaint. It's an observation that is important to grasp before playing.  As long as all players are aware of this, it is unlikely that one player will be allowed to monopolize the stronger patrons early in the game, when it can make the most difference.

People will complain that the scoring markers are far too big for the scoring track. It's a downright stupid mistake, [b][i]but[/i][/b] it doesn't effect gameplay. More importantly, the fact that the patron powers are not balanced does not make for an unbalanced game. It's the player's job to assign values to the various elements and make gameplay choices which balance the cost of cube expenditure with the relative value of patron powers and museum placements. I find it difficult (Okay, I'm terrible at this), but the play flows smoothly, and there's a kind of elegence to the overall interplay between the game elements and mechanics. Of particular note are the double-sided placards (terrain on one side and patron on the other).

I like that the order of the patronage colors in the wings of the museum varies from game to game, so a player whose recurring strategy is to focus on certain patrons will not always have those patrons adjacent in the museum (a real advantage when your patrons share a value 2 room).

Played once with 4P. An area majority game which has players competing for majorities in small parcels of land. Many elements tread on familiar ground – players have to work with a limited number of cubes in their personal supply, and have to know which battles are worth fighting for. The interesting bit is that players get to collect tiles which then turn into useful once-per-turn abilities.

Overall, Mykerinos is brisk-playing but dry. I didn't feel like I was making clever moves, but rather very pragmatic ones.

First play: a decent cube placement (area control) game with multiple paths to score (set collection, etc). Players are using cubes to represent expeditions in Egypt. Each turn, players either start an expedition (1 cube on the board) or extend a cuurent expedition by 2 cubes. Once all players have passed, the areas are scored. Players get to keep the area cards with patron abilities or seed a cube into the museum to determine the value of patrons they own at the end of the game.

Turns are fairly quick though the game does bog down slightly towards the end when players have stacks of Patron cards to activate.

Neat middleweight. Will update after more plays.

Give this game a graphical overhaul and it likely would get much more love. The mechanics are solid and it's a fast playing area control game for four. The board is bland, the components are mostly small cubes and the "museum" is a printed outline...but, whoever designed the graphics for the rulebook should find another line of work. The game play and the mechanics fortunately overshadows some of the design flaws, this is a solid game even with the "Mr. Brown" issue.

I didn't have a clue as to what I was supposed to do in this game at the very beginning, but I seemed to figure out most of it near the end of the game.  "Clue" is an interesting word because each of the personalities has a color referenced last name similar to the characters in Clue.  It looks like one of the strategies involves "going after" some of the personalities such as Mr. Brown early in the game.  The game essentially consists of two different area control games with the "excavation portion" broken into different phases to gain control of the museum.  Players who like Lost Cities or Egyptian games might like this one.

Wow! Another great game from Ystari!! The quality of the components is outstanding. The theme is thin, but this is an excellent area control game. The various mechanisms (cube placement, room reservation, patron tapping) all work well together to give players lots of choices in the way to play. Initial rating a 9, but am willing to guess that this will only increase after many playings.

A surprise hit. I purchased this game because of the good reviews I read and the price (under $30Can!). I only wish it scaled up to 5 players. Go Ystari!
Update: I adjusted my rating up half a point. I used to think that the museum patrons were unbalanced in favour of Sir Brown, but after I dominated a game with a heavy Lord Lemon strategy, I can see now that the patrons are more balanced than they first appeared. The other patrons do require more expert finesse to take advantage of them though.

This is a nice tight area control game with a some fun choices with cube management, movement and special actions.  I rather enjoyed my time spent playing it and look forward to playing it again, but at the same time I wasn't overwhelmed by it either. 

Regardless, it is a very clean system and if you like mathing things out this game is for you.  I suspect that further plays are going to cause my rating to move dramatically up or down.

Fun quick little game. It does what a good game should, it forces players to make some tough but interesting decisions and every turn you wish you could do just a bit more but at the same time the decisions you do make don't feel useless. Turns play quickly and there is a lot of player interaction as you fight for control of the board. I don't normally like two player games where you have to play a fake neutral player but this one works quite well. I actually miss having the neutral pieces in games with more players.

A quick play area control game with a surprising amount of choices and a bit of a brain burner. Comment was made about being a very similar game to Louis and I couldn't agree more. Some of the components could have been better constructed (card board chits for scoring markers, pass markers and museum exhibit influence should have been wood) and the board is a bit on the muted side. That said, it played very well with three, always a hard number to please. Would like to try again with 4.

1 play. 

It's a fast-playing area control game. There are 2 play areas: the desert, where you go to collect cards (come in 5 colors; some give instant VP, some give VP at end, some do both), and the museum, where the value of the cards is determined. The cards are arranged in 4 pairs (6 pairs in the 4th/last round). Both areas are resolved by an area-control mechanism. Each round, you add 8 markers to your supply, then players take turns till everyone passes (when 2nd-to-last passes, last player gets 1 more turn). On your turn, you may either place a new marker onto a tile or add 2 markers to a tile where you already have at least 1 marker (must be placed in a chain, starting at a previous marker). When everyone passes, resolve tiles: in rank order (# of markers in pair; earlier to pass wins ties), choose to either take 1 of the tiles or place a marker in the museum (in a common area, or adjacent to previously placed marker). Specific locations in the museum will increase the value of the cards at end of game, from basic 1 up to 2, 3, or 5. Once cards are acquired, later in the game they may be used to add or modify the basic options (add a marker to the museum, place 2 new markers onto a pair of cards, add 3 markers adjacent to previously placed marker, allow marker placement on card areas that are normally inaccesible, and place a marker taken from stock rather than your supply). At game end, tally up the points: sum of VP earned during game, value of cards collected (based on your markers positions in the museum), and 5VP/full set of cards. High score wins (tiebreaker = cubes in personal stock)!

Played just once so far with two players and there are some interesting decisions and a decent amount of tension.  It seemed a bit dry to me, but maybe I need to play it again with more players.  Also, I don't normally care one way or the other about production as long as the game is fun.  However, here you have a contrast between nicely produced cards and a board that is just too small, not to mention the ultra tiny cubes, elements which I found somewhat distracting.

I find the "take turns dropping pellets on the board" process rather tedious, and in the one game I played there didn't seem to be much I could do about it once I fell behind... which happened, like, immediately... but allowing for the little decisions about where to drop the pellets taking too long for the amount of fun they were, it was still interesting in a way, and maybe with experience it could become a contest and could move quicker.

Average game.  Wouldn't mind playing it with two, but with 4, players do weird favors for each other that don't really work out evenly.  The look is nothing special, and it seems like there can be problems with runaway leaders.  I'd play it again, but I'm not impressed so far.

Played 1+ times.  Very clever quick little area control game.  Lots of special power action.  The special powers all seem very well balanced on top of that you have to control how much you score for each of the pieces you win.  Almost seems like the area control half of the game needs one more turn, but the museum (scoring mini game) is probably best at the current length. Better with 4 than with 2 players. 2006/06/15

It's a well designed euro that combines a tactical placement phase where you basically drop stones onto the board, with a collection phase where you have to collect certain combinations to gain vict pts and special powers. On the professional side it's more of a "8" its well designed, the rules are fairly clean, the play is easy to understand. So if you think you might like it, you might boost my rating up by one pt. For me the theme is not so hot and the pt. grabbing doesnt thrill me, but I like the tactical dropping of the stones.  I've had fun the several times I've played and the learning curve is not steep.  It can certainly work with strangers at a game party and it does play in likely under an hour so that's good too. So it fits a niche of moderate thinking/under an hour/3 or more players. It fits that niche quite well.

RATING: 7.5
I've played this game a couple of times now and I really like it.  There is great player interaction throughout the game and yet you are very concerned about what you are trying to do to advance your own situation.  I love the small pieces and the limited board size too.  Very neat and relatively quick to explain and play.  I think there is considerably long-term playability too because there is so much player interaction (no two games are ever the same).

I have heard this game compared to a light version of Louis XIV and although I agree with the light part, it really didn't feel much like Louis to me.  I enjoyed the game, but I am not sure if I enjoyed it enough for it to move to one of the first ones I would pull out when introducing a light Euro to new players.  My wife didn't like it at all and felt that once she was behind there was simply no recovery.  She was often locked out of areas and found she simply could NOT aid in generating value to her patrons.

Good area control game for 4 players. Some of the roles seem to be a bit more powerful, but all players should be working to keep one player from stockpiling certain patrons. BTW, I totally suck at this game. The mechanics are easy enough, but I can't put it together in a coherent strategy. I like the MaBiWeb.com implementation, because seeing your total score the whole way is really helpful to me.

Update: This one is meh. I liked it for a bit, but just don't care for it as much anymore. Hard to put my finger on exactly what it is, but the game got less and less interesting the more I played.

Good amount of strategy for such a short game.  The small board makes it very portable.

Update:  Rating goes down from 8 to 7.  Mostly because Mykerinos was one of my first games and I was very enthusiastic.  I have played many more games since.  I still like this, but it is a bit heavy and it doesn't get played as much as I'd like.

Update: I haven't played this in years. I have no idea why. I genuinely like it and there really isn't another area majority game that is is as meaty or short as this one.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 3
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 2
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3

Ystari's take on area control joins the pantheon of great area control games.  While not quite as good as El Grande, San Marco, or Louis XIV, this game is another interesting twist on the mechanic.  Mykerinos delivers a lot of game in a very short period of time, filling a great niche in any collection.

I got this because BGG's "Recommended" lists suggested it the second most often (based on my favorite games) after Taj Mahal. Also, I was curious to examine whether area majority itself is enough to interest me.

It certainly reminded me most of Eight-Minute Empire, of games I've played. But instead of market-drafting cards that let you populate regions in certain ways, you're fairly freely placing cubes in areas in order to obtain one of several things that will be available to the two (usually) area majority winners of the area.

The prizes aren't amazing. Points, cards that grant placement abilities once per "season," and the right to place a cube in the "museum." The museum looks like a separate area majority game but it's better described as a way of claiming score multipliers for having certain colors of cards at game end.

It's certainly easy to play and has reasonably interesting decisions. I do feel like a power or two (i.e. colors of cards) is quite weak, and people say brown is the best. I would prefer it if you didn't score points during the game since most points are scored at the end. (There's a scoring track, and the leader at any moment doesn't really reflect who's winning.) I also feel like the game is short enough that the difficulty in predicting what a player will do makes the game feel chaotic, and like a single misstep can be very costly.

...Also, the theme only half works. I'm ok with with playing area majority by placing dig sites, but I don't know how to rationalize that winning a given area lets me choose between two characters' abilities or instead the right to place in the museum (perhaps under an unrelated character). I don't get what the museum, and how it increases your score, are supposed to represent.

...Played again. This may be the driest euro ever, but there are some interesting things about it. The two forms of area control serve as forms of drafting of goals, creating diverging incentives. The fact that the patrons are unbalanced isn't necessarily a flaw, but rather something to keep in mind as the incentives are initially evolving.

The simplicity of the gameplay of dropping cubes on the desert grid gives the feel of a multiplayer abstract, with the (IMO) appealing feeling that if you thought about your move and subsequent player moves long enough, you could come up with the best move. This seems much simpler to think through than something like Through the Desert.

The minimalist in me wants to get rid of the museum. Change the brown guy's power and score using squares of cards held or something. That might make the game even drier, but I think it would speed it up, too.

I can't give this game the coveted 7.0 thumbs-up, but I'm removing it from my hypothetical trade pile.

This is easily one of my favorite games. I find that I'm almost always in the mood to play it. The depth for the short play time is a big plus for me. I like how many things there are to think about in this game. Mykerinos is a great design. The process of play is fun enough that I don't mind losing. Each game has played differently. I have played with 2 and 3 players, and the game really changes from 2 to 3 players, which is another bonus. If you like games that have medium-weight gameplay with a short play time, also try out Arkadia.

My wife's and my complaint: theme just doesn't fit well. We wished it had been better implemented to pull us in. Through the Desert pulls us in more than this. The art is kind of dark, and I'm not fully impressed with the artwork on the board. Kind of unbalanced and hard to see everything.

NOTE: In my experience, this is NOT a wife game!

This is more or less a standard area majority game not unlike Kreta or to a lesser extent, El Grande. the game itself is not bad. I like the basic setup. It's simple and quick and the game is not that hard to teach. The theme is really well integrated. I thought the excavation and the museum exhibitions fit very well. The patron system is the rule-breaking mechanism for the game and I do like the Caylus-style passing out of the round mechanisms to win ties.
Not a bad game, but in light of how many area majority games there are out there, I am not sure this will can compete with El Grande just yet.

After a couple of 2-player games, I think the game is so-so with 2 players. I think more players will be better for this game.

RATING: 8
Do *not* try to teach this game by a straight reading of the rules.  In fact some of the actions explained in the second phase don't make sense until you have read the 3rd phase.  It tells you to turn a card sideways to indicate that you have used it before you even know how you get it.  I normally try to review the rules before teaching a new game and I picked the wrong time to make an exception.

Once you get past that, it is quite a nice game medium weight game.  The rules are actually pretty simple, but you need an overview of how they work before you get into a linear phase by phase description.  The different sponsors of the game can really change how you play, so you will either have favorites that you want to get early to suite your style of play, or you will want need to adjust your play to suite the sponsors you get in early rounds.  It makes for a nice dynamic game, which I like.  I went for a strong early presence in the museum, but that resulted in me getting fewer cards.  Others were able to get more sponsors by concentrating more on the dig site.  In the end, the top two players were determined by a tie breaker and the third place person was only one behind us.  Unfortunately, the bad rules explanation on my part meant that most of us didn't understand the end scoring (me included), but it is still interesting that we were so very close.

Finally played by the correct rules (2-player), this is a  great game, we played in about 50 min. including rules review.  I really like the relatively fast pace but there are still difficult decisions to be made.  I usually dislike games that use a simulated 3rd player in a 2-player game but in Mykerinos it works very well, and feels more like an added defensive mechanism than a simulated 3rd player.

Not particularly interesting gameplay, made worse by a really questionable presentation of theme.  Pillaging the treasures of the ancient world and bringing them back to the museums in Europe happened, but I see no reason to glorify it so glibly as this game does.  With light little characters like Lord Lemon, and Colonel Tangerine with cartoon caricatures, the game says "Gosh, remember that period where we stole lots of things from the rest of the world?  That was great!"  Hell, at least Indiana Jones does ancient archaeology in order to fight Nazis.  Such a theme should have some acknowledgment of the dark side of this era, or it becomes whitewashing of the worst nature.

Double area control game, where you place markers on plots of land. The most markers on the land cards wins them, or allows the player to place a marker on a multiplier in the museum, which makes your cards worth more. The plots of land also serve as special characters, which allows you certain abilities when placing markers on plots in later rounds, such as placing more markers than usual, placing in normally unavailable areas, etc.

Decent game, but nothing super special. In general, these kind of abstract-y area control games aren't my favourites.

Rated after three games. Nice archeology themed game, which has something in it, but not enough. The game is fast and easy, but understanding all the cards and scoring possibilities take a game or two, so playing with beginners is not very challenging. But it is quick, so several games can be played in one night.

A quick, tense area majority game. I really enjoy the mechanic of balancing point acquisition now, with increased point earning capability later, through the variably-valued patron cards. The two area majority games that are played simultaneously within the game (the excavation and the museum) combine for a challenging and fun package. Bonus: exceptional 2 player gameplay.
------------------------------------
Never seemed to make it to the table and when it did I always felt kind of empty after the game. I think it is well designed and full of meaningful decisions but in the end it just didn't resonate with me so it has moved on.

A lot of game in a little box (and few rules). A pleasant spatial area-majority game with a touch of special powers. Decision of when to pass is interesting, as passing order is the tie-breaker. One of my go-to mid-weight games.

I'm intrigued by this game.  It's a perfect information game with a random board setup, and yet it still plays in just under an hour.  The randomness of the board prevents the game from becoming predictable, but the perfect information makes a win very satisfying.  It also has elements of an area control game (something that I'm not fond of), but the areas are small enough, and the game intuitive enough, that it's not much of a detraction from the game.  That it's a brain burner that doesn't take an entire afternoon to play is definitely a plus.

So far this is based on several 2 player games, but the more we play it, the more we like it. Agonizing decisions at every turn. It plays fairly quickly. It sets up quickly. It comes in a smallish box. Great decisions to be made. I'm guessing it scales up well, too, though I don't yet know that. The best thing I can say is when we're done playing, we sit for awhile and dissect the game just played. That's always the mark of a good game.

Very interested - the approx 1 hour play time is attractive,  and the promise of deep strategy makes it doubly so.  What bothers me the most is the rather unappealing map of the Museum on the main board - to me, frankly,  it looks like their art budget was suddenly completely depleted. Now that I own this,  I can definitely say that there's a lot of tight play here - but bundled with that is the fact that it's therefore a bit unforgiving.  Definitely issues of evaluation - it's tough to know what's important, especially during the first play.  Patrons may appear equivalent, but definitely are not.  Components are minimal - the board with the minimalist museum, tiles are a bit samey - even though the differences in layout are critical!  You get the Caylus-size minicubes - would have much rather have the larger cubes from el Grande - and the scoring markers are a tad too large.

I like the little box and the little board. Quality parts and artwork.  Nice game to play.  It has taken a mix of elements and combined them well: area control, winning cards to help you later and resource management (which action do I do now), short term vs long term points.  I would like to try it as a 2 player.

Good, fun game, but BOY are the visuals busy. The hieroglyphic pattern on the rules and on the gameboard makes it almost impossible to see what's going on. Terrible.
But the game is worth it - it's a region majority game that's over in 30 minutes. Not many of them in that category.

Players control teams of archeologists in a strategic area control of a modular desert tiles board with obstacles and relics for the museum. Play a cube on any area, or play two cubes to expand from an existing location. Block opponents and counter to gain majority of the divided desert regions. Like a giant tic-tax-toe game to fill the most squares and block the moves of your opponents. Meh.

Burns the brain like many majority control games. Scoring is both direct (I make this play, I get X points) and indirect (I make this other play, I can do this other thing which will eventually get me more points). Very nice tiles, though the cubes could be bigger.

What a horribly unintuitive and brutally unforgiving game. With 75-80% of your total game score being determined by your end game bonuses, there is no margin for error any step along the way. So if you invest 3-4 cubes that earn you nothing the first round, while the other players are earning supporters, there's simply no way to catch up to the rest of the power curve. Even if you horde pieces for the next round, you can't get them out fast enough to compensate for the powerful abilities of the advisors, and can find yourself forced into a losing proposition very early on, making the second half of the game meaningless. Would be simply average, but gets knocked down a full point for the horrible game design and graphic design decisions -- namely the back-loaded scoring focus, the atrocious high contrast rule booklet with 7 point type (virtually impossible to read), scoring markers larger than the scoring spaces, poorly developed icons to represent the supporter powers, and overall very disappointing component design. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
As just an area majority game Mykerinos is a fairly competent effort.  The patron powers are a nice touch, but what really sets itself apart is the inclusion of the museum, where you can manipulate the scoring.  However, I am somewhat concerned that Brown may be considerably more useful than the other four, and if arranged next to Purple, it could be a combo that is unbeatable.  Of course this is solely speculation on my part after one play, however, if proven true, I'll most likely be deducting points because I dislike design that has unbalanced paths to victory.

As a two-player game, a more experienced person will thrash a newcomer every time.  That said, I think there is a solid and interesting system here.  Aspects of it are reminiscent of Louis XIV, but the decisions seem more make-or-break in Mykerinos.  With three players, there's a little more leeway, but the competition for plurality is fiercer.

After 2+ Plays: I've enjoyed every Ystari game so far and this is not an exception.  The pyramids block off certain spaces and provide for a lot of interesting tactical decisions, and the way the game rewards you for focusing on one or two patrons (through tight competition in the museum) allows you to try different strategic paths in each game.

This Euro, at first brush, both looks and feels like your run-of-the-mill area control game. Character powers which can be exploited and no clunky, "gamey" rules helps this one stand out, though. I don't usually love these gear-turning kind of games (they all seem too similar, too lifeless), but this one offers a good time.

Own the Nile expansion.

Want to play using the right rules... played with a slight shortage of archeologists.

Edit. Yes, getting 11 archeologists each round instead of only once changes the game "slightly".

Excellent area-control exercise.

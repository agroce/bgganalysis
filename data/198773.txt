It takes my favorite party game, Codenames, and puts a new twist on it by using images. Codenames: Pictures is a harder game but equally satisfying and it is better if you have people in your group for whom English is not a first language. However, while i enjoy it for a change of pace, I still prefer the original Codenames.

LIKE: Same as codenames, the word version.
DISLIKE: The pictures themselves can be difficult to discern in bad lighting.

OVERALL: Fun, same as Codenames, but with pictures. I'm not sure which version is better, but the word version seems harder which I find better in the long run.

All the good points about Codenames but the pictures makes it easier to pick the assassin due to the similiarity in pictures moreso than words. A better version in my view but the best thing is they are both great games and you can even mix and match them!

My codenames review: 
"A very easy game to teach and plays very quick and can fit a big group. It is one of those games where a review does not do it justice till you play it. It is immensely interactive and interestingly even when it is not your team's turn you are constantly discussing old clues and planning whether to push your luck with another clue if you are leading or trailing in the game. 
Downsides are firstly, the clue giver is under the spotlight and there is stress as the whole team depends on how you come up with clues. Also, more vocal players will dominate the game over quieter ones especially in bigger groups. 
Overall though such a simple game but yet so good I played 6 games in a row and still would not have minded to play more. Highly recommended."

1st play: Similar enough to Codenames but exercising a different part of my brain. I like the idea of throwing all the pieces from the different versions together and even combining pictures with words. Not too much to say except I like both about the same. I'm not sure they're different enough to make them both necessary, but for the price, no reason not to play them both from time to time.

RATING: 7.5
Codenames is a game I enjoyed playing, very good party game and fun, with a fast pace. Codenames: Pictures is even better, it not only put this game into a language independent level, the more than one meaning of the pictures gives a better chance to combine the cards together. So it is better than the first Codenames game.

Lewis managed to get a pre-release copy of this but, admittedly after just one play, it feels much harder. The difficulties in seeing patterns means that there is longer thinking time before giving the clue. It's turned an end of evening social game into something more strenuous.

RATING: 7
The original Codenames got a pretty lukewarm reception from me and I wasn't expecting to like the version in which pictures replace words any better.  To my surprise, I did.  What I like about the pictorial version is that it has gone slightly Dixit, in that the images are a bit surreal and many have more than one thing going on.  For me this opened up more possibilities for giving clues and also more pitfalls.

I won't comment on production quality and art as I played a prototype.

Better than the words version, because players could use simple words to describe the picture. Using words to describe pictures is always easier than using words to describe words.

Little risky when no common feature found or more pictures sharing the common feature.

RATING: 8
Like Codenames, except it has pictures instead of words. And, perhaps critically, the pictures are surreal blends of things, like a bug with a diamond or a stoplight with stick people walking out of it. This makes things more open to interpretation, and more memorable. Pics seem to have an edge over not blowing it on the first round ("you said BOMB and you missed FIREWORKS right there in the corner!") and debates over what is or isn't a fair clue. You can mix and match, though, which seems great too! Recommended.

Initial Impression: For such a simple game with simple rules, this game poses some real challenges to the code givers. My plays of it were grueling but fun. This game can be brought out at parties and can accommodate groups of all sizes. I think part of the charm is the artwork, which is strange but interesting. This is one of the few games that I may end up picking up to add to my collection, as I can see it being brought out on family game nights.

The original Codenames earned my love from the get go and every version to follow has been solid. You don’t really need them all, and I’d probably recommend the original over this, BUT I personally enjoy this one more! The difficulty is definitely increased because it is simply more complicated to link multiple pictures than isnis to link multiple words. Give Codenames a go and if you like it a whole lot then I’d definitely recommend getting this version as well! Recommended Players: 4 or 6.

Zelfde principe als Codenames, maar met tekeningen.

Bovendien zijn niet alle kaarten duidelijk.  Ik verkies echt wel de gewone Codenames.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I strongly prefer this version because of the abstract and open nature of the picture-interpretation. Additionally, I think that it is more suitable for families as there is no reading-/language-barrier.

Part of my view might stem from one of my gaming groups playing the original Codenames in a way that borders to cheating (or at least counters the intended way to play it).

As fun as the original, but the way you have to think it's different. Maybe it's more easy to relate elements, and there's more geeky stuff, but it's fun as well and it's a different experience from original Code Names, both can be used on different situations.

Ultimately like this better than the original, because of the dual nature of the pictures. There's usually more than one thing going on, lending itself to someone noticing the spider web on that chess peace and misunderstanding your spider clue to go to that. This can lead to some AP from the leaders but if they are thinking of their clues during the other person's turn, it doesn't seem to be an issue. 

May not work in all situations but a good party game that allows drop in and drop out play-ability.

Having played both, I think the text version works better for me. Being the team captain and staring at pictures makes it harder for me to think outside the box because the visuals are already there. The pictures somehow need a double translation in my head.

On the other hand the pictures make it easier to connect to your team mates because the pictures provide a more common language. When using textual descriptions creative thinking sometimes ends up being too creative and things go wayward.

It's essentially the same game as Codenames, yet it's different enough.

I thought this variation on an excellent game was just a money grab.  Well, let me tell you... it's an excellent variation... as well as the money grab thing.  Oh, it's just as cheap as you, so just get it as well.  What?!  You don't own Codenames Original Flavour?  Enjoy both.  Ahhh....

RATING: 7
To each their own on what they think is better (Pictures vs words), but for my group this is the one that is hitting the table.  This is because English is a 2nd language for some.  The pictures themselves are also pretty imaginative.  I imagine once we go through all the pictures a few times, that novelty will get lost.

RATING: 2
I like the original Codenames a lot, but I really don't like this version.

It works exactly the same as the original Codenames, except the words are replaced with pictures. These are entirely of a bizarre/surreal style (similar to Dixit, if you've ever played that.) Whenever I've played this game, myself and all my friends have found the pictures much harder to give good hints for. The result is that the game just plays flat-out worse than the original Codenames because spymasters are so often reduced to boring and obvious hints. Really clever hints that link 4 or 5 disparate words are quite possible in the original, but they almost never happen in this version. There's also just a lot going on in each picture, which slows down the game because each one requires a lot of examination by both spymaster and guesser. The words-only version plays far faster because the cards can be completely understood at a glance. 

Personally, I don't find the art very charming, either. Unless you're playing with people who don't speak much English (in which case this may be very helpful), I would strongly recommend sticking to the original Codenames.

RATING: 8.5
A great variant, and the production on this set is WAY better than the first. The pictures seem perfectly designed, and the 4x5 grid is great for this experience. A better game? I'm not sure. I want to try a 5x5 of pictures, and of mixed pictures and words, but so far this seems like atleast as good as the first set. I love that the first game is a word game that I actually like, where now this one feels similar to Dixit and other picture games, so I will continue to rate the original higher (for now) because it occupies a more unique space in my collection.

Played at Hex - a board game cafe in Krakow. Surprised at how much I enjoyed the game as I was more speculative approching this iteration of Codenames. Certainly stands up to the base game, initial impression is 8/10 (same as regular Codenames) but not one I think will hit the table enough to buy, as my other half/group will always pick Duet/Regular Codenames over this one. Keeping my eye out for a trade though - expect the family will enjoy.

-Easy to explain
-Nice game even for not "geeks"
-Always challenging
-Really interesting illustrations (the fact that they are in black and white it's really important! Otherwise almost all the codewords would be colour-related!)
-Language indipendent

Cons:
-The box is huge compared to what is inside, I have made a smaller one (the original one is 4 times bigger) where all the cards fit just right.

Still the same old excellent Codenames feel. The pictures can be interpreted in many more ways than words typically can, which means it can be more difficult to exclude opponent's cards. A little bit more tricky for the Spymasters.

Not as good as the original word version in which I enjoy the challenge of being Spymaster. Rated this high because I like combining with the words for freshness: 3 columns of words and 2 columns of pictures.

RATING: 8
It is certainly fun, which isn't surprising, as it is based on Codenames, which I consider to be an excellent game. However, as it is based on that game, I can't help but compare them. Where Codenames has me making clever clues to connect different words, this one seems to often default to making clues based on art that cards have in common. Oh, those three pictures have clothing in them? I'll say clothes 3. As such, I'd rather play the original. I also prefer the larger work space of the original.

Same as the original for the most part. The board is slightly smaller, which I don't like. It ramps down the difficulty and creativity a little. I have only played Codenames maybe 6 or 7 times and am already kind of sick of it. There are some boards where you can get creative, but a lot of the time it feels plodding. Everyone who plays it seems to like it, and that degree of universality is rare, so that is undeniably a huge positive. But it is a bit quiet for me as a party game, and a bit boring when you are the clue receiver, especially in games with more than 4. I still like it, but burned out fairly quickly. I have played some Resistance lately and I vastly prefer the bombast/human element of a game like that in a party setting, but A LOT of people don't like it, so it is tougher to get to the table. So Codenames has a place for sure.

We played codenames pictures on our last game night. Two teams each had 4 players. We enjoyed the game and everyone seems to want to play more. We played 5 rounds total. 8 players did not feel like too many, but the game is so flexible that I feel even 4 players would be a good amount. The only down side is the time it takes to come up with good clues creates a lot of quiet moments.  Some of the pictures are disturbing, and somewhat nightmarish.

We've found it more difficult to channel combinations together with Codenames: Pictures than its older brother. I prefer the original for this reason, but both are great.

Card game pitting two teams against each other. The cards contain all kinds of pictures. The teams have to find their own cards. These are marked on a card which only the captain of the team can see. This person has to try and guide his or her team by describing as many of his cards as possible by means of 1 word. Once the team has discovered all of its cards, it still has to find the assassin card in order to secure the win. The game can be played with large groups (party game).

For me, this is a step down from standard Codenames.   The images are trippy and done in an obvious way so that they have double or triple meanings.   The board (as a 4x5) has significantly fewer neutral spaces.   The "8-Ball" Assassin ending is a nice rule variant, however.   Overall, this is harder and slower than the original, and I don't think either of those things help it.

On my first play it worked just as well as the original. There are only 20 cards instead of 25, which reduces downtime at the beginning. Wordplay is a fun element of the original, and this version may do away with some of that, so I'm concerned it may not be as enjoyable. More plays needed.

On BGG a follow-up game based closely on another game usually has a better rating than its parent due to the fact that the people buying and playing a follow-up are generally fans of the parent game.  Therefore the sample of people rating the follow-up game is a biased sample, largely drawn from those who enjoy the parent.

Codenames Pictures has a lower rating than Codenames.  I think therefore my view seems to be shared widely: this is not nearly as good as Codenames.  I can’t actually put my finger on why, but it just is that way.

This is a reimplementation of the wildly popular game, Codenames.  As the name implies, this game uses pictures instead of words to form the game grid.  The picture cards provided in the game are bichromatic illustrations that usually combine multiple objects/characters into weird/ironic/humorous/twisted combinations.  This allows the clue giver more options when coming up with a clue word, but also requires more consideration when trying to avoid certain cards.  Other than the difference in cards, the game plays the same as the original.

As a fan of the original game, I enjoyed this one just as much.  Using pictures provides a refreshing twist on the original concept.  Some people prefer one version over the other, but in my opinion there's room for both in a collection.  Highly recommended!

Codenames. With pictures.

RATING: 4
2016-11-27 : The brilliant thing about the original Codenames is that - at least in English and Dutch - most words on the cards either have a double/triple meaning or could contextually be differently interpreted. Not so with the picture version : a monkey in a spacesuit is a monkey in a spacesuit.  You'd think that having pictures would make it easier to give clues, but it's actually much harder to come up with clever double and triple ones. The only reason I can see somebody liking/playing this game over regular Codenames is because the latter isn't available in their own language or if you want to play this with young kids. It's simply less good.
2017-04-23 : We played a couple of games of the variant where you mix picture cards with the original's word cards and to my surprise that actually worked well.

It's Codenames with monochrome Dixit-esque cards. It also shrinks the board (unless you get the promos tiles). If you own Dixit and the original Codenames, I don't think this is entirely necessary. Well, if you use Dixit cards, I would disallow people using a color as a clue. It is convenient that you can fit both this and the original game in the same box. Some people prefer playing Codenames with pictures, and some prefer playing it with words. I personally prefer words by a large margin, but there is less persnickity rules to cover when playing the pictures version. Still a great addition to the series.

One thing I dislike is when people give clues about the number of objects as a clue. It's debated whether this is legal or not:

I think I'd prefer to play Codenames with Dixit cards - the images are interesting, but could be more exciting. I guess they're designed so people can't just e.g. say a colour, but it means there are only a few elements to each picture.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Not sure if this says something about being left or right brained, but I had an easier time making word connections with pictures instead of the original word based Codenames. Essentially it is more of the same game, but with a low price point and almost universal appeal, I would not begrudge anyone from getting several versions of the game.

RATING: 6
A bit of a step back from Codenames (: Words). Pictures has much stronger table presence than Words, but Words explores an interesting facet of human language that Picutres fails to replicate. At the end of the day though, its basically the same game. I don't see the need to own both (unless to mix and match, which would likely be very fun), but I'd recommend Pictures over Words for anyone who hadn't already landed a copy.

I am somewhat conflicted about this game. I LOVE Codenames, but while this game has the advantage of doing away with some of the more fiddly rules of the original ("So, the clue is... frost 2! No, wait, there's "Frost" on the table. Well, let's say... board 2! Oh, s**t., there's "Cardboard" as well. Uh, what about Jack 2? What do you mean 'No proper names?!"), it also has an issue: pictures have an orientation, and if you're sitting on the wrong side of the table, you either have to pick them up and look at them (which makes the game slower and fiddlier), or you may miss some crucial detail. Overall, I enjoy this game, but perhaps not as much as I enjoy the original Codenames.

The game is language independent, thanks to the pictures thus can be played as a tool for learning English, or even be played with non-English speaking players.

Somehow significantly inferior to the base game. Fewer cards and losing the power of connotation makes links easier to establish. It's not like these are Dixit cards that are super open to interpretation. There are really two or three things in total on each card.

Can't imagine choosing this over the word game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I am really not sure why but this picture version is simply not as much fun as the word version... even though they are EXACTLY the same game. 

The pictures are fairly strange and pretty open to interpretation which can (and will) lead to more wrong guesses. As spy master I enjoy the challenges of thinking up a single clue to link 3 or 4 of the words together whereas in this version oft times you can link 3-4 clues together with a simple animal 4 or food 3 so a lot of the challenge is then reduced. 

I am also finding the pictures are more difficult to interpet if they are upside down for you... whereas in the base version the word is printed in both orientations... something I have never previously noticed until we played pictures and missed this feature

I am looking forward to mixing both versions together and giving that a go.

I also LOVE that the sand timer has been removed as it is such a dickish thing to do to people.

Codenames but with pictures seems like a logical jump, and it is. Unfortunately, the pictures almost always incorporate two simple objects into one (like a tidal wave and a bed), to the point that most clues that are given are incredibly easy, and with pictures with something like a wing on them being far too common. The original is a 10 out of 10 magnificent party game that's great for all skill levels and between friends or strangers, but Pictures does not live up to that whatsoever. Only get the original one, but maybe Pictures would be better for very young kids, but at that point you're better off getting Dixit anyways.

It's simply a variant on Codenames. It has some strengths and weaknesses compared to the original, I like them both equally.

Strengths: Language independent, can give clues for what's on the card, cool pictures. This results in a game that is easier to play, especially if you have a mixed language group.

Weaknesses: There's fewer opportunities for clever word play and wild correlations. I think because of the picture format, people have a hard time looking beyond the picture itself and therefore interpret and give clues that are more literal, which isn't as much fun. Maybe this is group specific and maybe we'll get better at it.

The art is cool, but having multiple distinct items per card makes it easier to come up with boring clues. That, the smaller board, and the new (optional?) assassin rules all point in the direction of making Codenames more approachable for people who aren't super fun to play Codenames with. For such a group-dependent game that's a mixed blessing at best.

Codenames with Dixit-esque pictures.   

Thought I'd like it more than I did, but due to the strange nature of the pictures, it makes things pretty difficult.

Strong variant. I have heard it described as more approachable and less language dependent than the original. While the latter is obviously true...I'm not so sure about the former. I found many of the images to be culturally bound leaving some out if they didn't get the reference. Not sure yet which I prefer. I like the images and appreciate the challenge in creating pictures that are ambiguous, layered and denotational at the same time. Very clever, tight and satisfying gameplay. My team lost our first four games...twice to the assassin card...making me wonder if it's easier to trigger that trap w pictures vs. words. We'll see! Great game

Compared to the original:
- Easier for kids, no need to read
- You need full access to the cards as there are details you might want to reference. Due to the fact that images only have one up and one down this might be troublesome for a larger group.

So I would say that I'll prefer the word version for adults.

I like the art work of the cards and they did a good job of making interesting pictures to pull clues from, but ultimately I find this a much easier and more boring version of Codenames.

This really is just as fun as the original Codenames. One advantage people haven't pointed out is that with the pictures version, you can split into two teams based on spoken language - nice if don't want a foreign guest to feel left out.

Codenames might honestly just be the best party game, period. This game is chock-full of creativity, tension, teamwork, comebacks, laughter, and excitement. It's extremely easy to grasp, plays up to 8 or even more very well, rewards good players while simultaneously allowing weaker players to catch up, and is about as far from "solvable" as could be. The sheer variety of combinations and the ways the clues can be given is simply stunning. I want to play it right now.

The picture version provides a nice change and might even appeal more to a more visual and less language-oriented crowd. The ability to mix the sets together is also welcomed, though it is a shame that the cards are not the same shape for ease of randomization. You can't really go wrong with this one or the original. Why not both?

Played the prototype in the Board Room at Origins. I hate Dixit, so I was concerned the pictures would be too Dixity. But they seem to have struck a good balance on the weirdness level of the pictures. I'm kind of disappointed that it doesn't integrate seamlessly with Codenames, but the Codenames cards are almost certainly too small for that to be a realistic possibility.

Can't decide if this is easier or harder than regular Codenames. You'd think easier because there are multiple "words" in each picture, but tying them all together seems is still a challenge. We like to use both pictures and words in the same game.

I don't want to succumb to the "new hotness" but this may be better than Codenames. When people make weird reaches in Codenames, it's often met with "what!!!???!!!", but in Codenames: Pictures a stretch connection is met with "Oh ya, I can see that". It's true that when you get down to just one, you really should never ever lose in Pictures. Wife says she prefers original codenames.

Initial rating: 8.0 (October 2016)

Codenames was my favorite game of 2015, so I couldn’t resist buying and playing Codenames: Pictures, besides, Vlaada Chvátil is my favorite game designer, so I always buy his games without knowing anything else about them.

Mechanically, the game remains the same (except now the card matrix is smaller) but with pictures. I also feel this version of the game is considerable easier than the word one (perhaps, that’s why the matrix is now reduced) because the surreal images have much more meanings than the word cards. The other difference is that now you can call directly what’s in the picture and I’m undecided about how I feel about this.

Everything else remain the same, that is, Codenames: Pictures is a very clever party game that is played by teams (I love this), you can explain it under 2 minutes, playtime is around 18 minutes, it works great with gamers and non-gamers alike.

The game components continues to be good. The art of the cards went the surreal way (a la Dixit) and is very well done, the only problem is that the card now have an orientation so players opposite to it need to pick up the card often to see all the details in it. 

The friend who explained the game to me said that there was a variant to mix both games, I really want to do that soon!

I don’t have anything bad to say about the game, to properly enjoy it you need the correct game group. I have some friends that really dislike the game.

Bottom line, I love Codenames: Pictures, but I still prefer the word game because it requires more from the players, this edition is way easier, however, it´s a good party game and I won’t ever refuse a game. A keeper in my game collection.

 - I prefer Codenames with words, as I feel they give people more to work off in that there's often more meanings to a word than obvious attributes to the pictures.
 - In my experience with Codenames Pictures, clues given seem to be more literal than in standard Codenames.
 - Good next step though if you get bored with regs Codenames.
 - Pictures are neat.
 - Haven't played with Dixit cards, but I think it'd slow the game even further.

This game is very comparable to its big brother. The main difference is that this game is a lot quicker to start! The first turn always takes a little while as the landscape is scoured, in pictures the first turn happens much quicker. Another difference is in pictures you can't link as many locations... two is difficult and three happened once. In its counterpart. Two was relatively easy and three doable, four was more difficult but could happen. I thought kids would be able to be the code master in this game... but alas, no! Keep the kids guessing, not clue giving!!! Great game, quicker played but just a little less satisfying.

If I had not played the original, I would probably have rated it higher. It's good, just not as good as codenames. The pictures does not lend themselves to as clever associations as the words.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Codenames is an excellent design that I rate a "9". This version has one slight rule change that can be applied to either version. Whereas in Codenames you can only make one more guess than the number spoken, in Pictures you can keep guessing until you hit an enemy spy, an assassin, or until you want to stop. That's it. Associating pictures well actually adds a level of translation from the picture to the word and then to associations with the word. Because the pictures usually blend two or more incongruous items, on that level you'll have multiple words per picture that you can associate - not just the individual items but also as an impression of the picture as a whole. You can really look at it either way, wherever the most associations can be made.

Not really a party game.  I do not understand the hype around this game.  It moves very slowly as players think of their clues and very dependent on the clue giver.  Not all clue givers are created equal, but everyone wants to give clues.

At first it appeared to be more difficult to find a description. Parsing the pictures isn't easy. Differing interpretations are likely, leading to more surprise results than in basic Codenames.

RATING: 9
Is it simple? Sure. Is it fun? Absolutely. I certainly understand people who don't get Codenames's popularity, but the popularity is deserved. I have played this with all kinds of people including my parents and in-laws, and it has been a huge hit every time. I often don't enjoy party games because I'd rather be playing a strategy game (even if it's a simple one), but I love any game that can be taught in 5 minutes and will get my wife, parents, and others excited about playing. Though Codenames is a simple party game, it is thinky enough to be really stimulating, especially if you are the one giving the clues. 

Though I think it is a great party game, it's not a party game for every siutation. It does require players to be focused, so it's maybe not the game you should pull out if people are in a silly mood, or want to be able to relax and not have to think much. This is better suited for situations where you're having a game night with several people and want to play a game with everyone together before breaking into groups. Still, I think it will be a hit in virtually every scenario.

It's a very good social game when having fun. I think this version works better as it's not so language dependant.

At first you think that pictures wouldn't fit well in the game mechanism. But then, all pictures have multiple items in them, e.g. a kangaroo with bee wings, allowing a tone of descriptions to fit (animal, mammal, insect, flying etc)
No reading so it can be played by children as well.
The combination with word cards from the original game makes a very challenging experience.

The main advantage of this version over the original one is the more "party"-ich atmosphere. The original Codenames is too much of a brain burner to be a party game. Codenames: Pictures is more subjective, which provides a more relaxing environment. Despite all that, I prefer the original Codenames, simply because I like making the conections between the words better than with images.

Tulajdonképpen teljesen ugyanaz, mint a szavas Fedőnevek, csak képekkel. Az nem teljesen világos, hogy miért lett 4x5-ös a "tábla", főleg, ha adnak hozzá utána promó lapkákat, amivel az 5x5-höz is elegendő lesz, no persze a kulcskártyákra viszont az eredeti szavas Fedőnevekből lesz szükségünk. Előnye lehet a 4x5-nek, hogy még rövidebb a játékidő, a képekkel pedig talán a kisebbek is könnyebben boldogulnak. Bár igen érdekes képi világról van szó. :)
A két készletet keverni is lehet, nekem tetszik az ötlet.

I thoroughly enjoy codenames, and the pictures one is almost as good. However, the pictures are sometimes hard to see and make out what they are, so one person may see something different depending on where they are sitting. I suppose this could add to the complexity of the game, but just added to the aggravating part of the game. 

All in all though, still a great game.

Removes language dependence from Codenames, but also removes much of the room for clever clues (as a word can have a number of meanings, but a picture is pretty straightforward).

No loss going from a 25-card grid to a 20-card grid.  This helps to reduce the thinking time for the spymasters (clue givers).

What are these strange symbols on the map? They are code for locations where spies must contact secret agents!

Two rival spymasters know the agent in each location. They deliver coded messages telling their field operatives where to go for clandestine meetings. Operatives must be clever. A decoding mistake could lead to an unpleasant encounter with an enemy agent – or worse, with the assassin! Both teams race to contact all their agents, but only one team can win.

Codenames: Pictures differs from the original Codenames in that the agents are no longer represented by a single word, but by an image that contains multiple elements.

RATING: 7.9
Seemingly no different from the original (well, 20 pics vs 25 words is all the difference) but I like the way you need to think and make associations slightly less (there you all create different images in your head about the words seen; here you create associations strongly based on the images you all see), also it lacks the slight Taboo aspect (not saying the word written on the card - it's much easier to say 'Kangaroo 1" here).
St9ill, the original concept is great so this one is also very good.

I consider this a very different game despite being almost the same because you have to think about things completely differently. I've noticed that it's the different between a good clue giver and a great one. The good one will sit down and say "I've got a Opera House anteater, a Windows hieroglyph, and a pot full of flowers. How can I connect them?" whereas a great one looks more at the individual elements in each picture and common threads. Some of the best clues I've seen have focused more on the tiny details and linked them instead of the overall picture.

Plays just like Codenames but with pictures.  The pictures are odd with say a heart tag on a bottle of poison.  It is interesting, but if I never play it again, I am ok with it.  I really did not like the game very much.  The alternate meanings of words in Codenames can open up a myriad number of choices whereas these wonky pictures limit you to 2 or three meanings at best.  I would just rather play Codenames.

It's hard to judge this independently of Codenames. If I had to play one of these games standalone, I think I might prefer vanilla codenames.

A fantastic variation of Codenames.  Love the art style of the pictures and discovering little nuggets within each picture.  The fact the the pictures aren't straight forward gives the player multiple hooks to hang their clues on.  And as a result, you're able to pull off more multiples within a turn.   In many respects, it's an upgrade to the original.  A must have for anybody who likes the original and truly a must-have for anybody who likes party games!

Very good version of Codenames, but that said I think I actually prefer the original a little more. This one the pictures are all combinations of other things, so while that gives you more options to tie them too, that also means making good clues is looking at EVERY TILE for a lot longer. 

The production on this version is better than standard Codenames, and I love the game, but the word version is a little easier to sell new players on, and has just as much depth.

Plays much like regular Codenames, only with a smaller grid that has fewer neutral spaces. Since it's done with pictures instead of words, it makes the game both language and age independent, so it's the game to pull out when you have a mixed group and/or younger players within the group.

However, there is one negative aspect, which is the reason I ultimately am rating it lower than original Codenames despite the fact that this version allows for more diverse groups, and that's how the images (unlike the words) aren't easily viewed from every angle, which I've experienced is a set-back for the younger crowd. It's still a stellar game, but because the words in regular Codenames is so easily read both ways, I still prefer that to this.

I do think I'd prefer the original one over the picture version, but I'd like to try it to make sure.

Update: I ordered it while it was on sale, just to make sure. I still don't expect to like it as much as the regular version.

Update #2: Yep, while some of the pictures are really cool,  we much prefer the original game. Connecting words is simply more interesting and provides more options...

Codenames is a game I definitely judged upon seeing the box. The first time I played the original Codenames, I felt like an ass. Codenames has a surprising amount of depth to it despite being really entry level. Codenames: Pictures just adds to it in every way, taking a great concept and bringing it to more abstract heights. The only downside to the game is that your enjoyment of the game is largely independent of the game itself. You're gonna be having a good or a bad time depending on who you invite to play.

This is the usual Codenames routine, and I won't ever be unhappy to play it. However, I do think the original is better. In my opinion, the words offer more opportunities for subtlety, picking up on unusual connotations or connections. How much you're able to tap into the multitude of meanings for some words is really up to the players, whereas there's a much shallower interpretation of the pictograms in this version of the game. Most of them feature two or three jarringly unrelated items, so you're typically trying to connect one of those items to something in another pictogram. Usually, the relationship is either obvious or non-existent. There just doesn't seem to be the same room for creativity in this game. But like I said, I'm perfectly fine playing this version; it's still a solid game.

Similar to the base game but I like the original more because with Codenames: Pictures you shouldn't be so creative with your clue: e.g. you could just say what's on the card to finish your last turn. In the original you can never say the word on the card. Also it's much more difficult to make associations with multiple cards at once. Unless you're playing with children, I would always choose the original above this. I also don't get why there are only 4x5 instead of the original 5x5 cards layed out. Definitively the lesser version of both but still good enough to keep in the collection if not to play with the kids or non-dutch speakers.

The basics of the game are very easy to pick up and the stack of card means there is a heap of replayability here. The real make-or-break of game like this is the other players. Fortunately, the other three people (all unknown to me as this was convention gaming) were all great and we had a couple of really interesting games.

I may be in the minority here, but I don’t care for Pictures as much as the other versions of Codenames. I think it falls flat for me because I compare to other, much better “picture” games like “When I Dream,” “Dixit,” “Mysterium,” and “Muse.” I also find making connections between words more fun and interesting because there are so many more possibilities based on events, context, etc.

This provides a nice twist to the original Codenames. A lot of people are saying that this version makes the original redundant, but I'm not so sure. I think the original is easier to play as a word written on a card usually only has one meaning but a picture can be interpreted in many different ways.
I enjoy both versions and will be keeping both in my collection.

-Satisfying when you "get" your teammate
-Can create funny discussions

[b]Dislike:[/b]
-Not as simple compared to other party games
-Long downtime
-Hard to come back from losing/cheap wins

It's alright, and can create some very funny moments. The downtime while a player is thinking bothers me a little too much though. Using a timer doesn't really help either because then you're just giving crap clues and then what's supposed the be the best moment of "Why the hell did you say plant if flower isn't one?!" "Because flowers aren't really plants!" becomes "Because I didn't have enough time to come up with something else" which is waaaay less funny than creating a discussion.

People new to the game usually also don't have that much patience. You're showing them this new game and their first reaction is "okay he just explained me the rules and now he's sitting there in silence". As a result, this is the most smartphone heavy game I've played.

I also believe it only really shines with at least 6 people, since as the clue giver you can hear your teammates discussing what your clues mean, which is the best bit!

Another, smaller problem is that when a person begins to say "right, 2" you have to tell them that's not allowed, and telling someone something's not allowed can make them feel very bad (not to mention the team already heard the clue by now). This surprisingly happened almost every time I introduced this game to new people. The simple solution is to just mention this during rules explanation, but it is easily forgettable to say since it seems pretty obvious.

A problem that might just be related to the pictures version (haven't played the original yet) is that when one team made a huge mistake (or is just really crap), the other team can just win by saying one word clues every round, which I think is way easier with the pictures version because then you can just say what you see on the picture.

Some people like Codenames: Pictures more than the original, some less. I think it all depends on how your brain works. The premise is exactly the same - guess which cards your teamate is referring to from an obscure, one word clue. Only this time, your clues are pictures, not words. This is a great follow-up that more than matches the original for me, whilst still bringing a new fresh spin to it.

(After 3 Plays) 1/18/17: This is a great follow up to the original Codenames.

RATING: 7
Just like the original Codenames, instead of words, there are pictures and as a spymaster you give clues for your team to guess the pictures. The setup is different though, it is a 5 X 4 grid, not 5 X 5, so there is more chance of hitting the assasin or other team's clues. 

Like the original, it's fun to play, but the visual aspect isn't really necessary for me, so I don't feel the need to own this one, if I own the original. The pictures have more detail which can lead to more interpretation, so the spymaster could potetntially be more liberal with their clues. .

Using images in place of words permits Codenames: Pictures to avoid some of the weirder rules enforcement issues of the original, but effectively creates new ones in their place.

This is really just a variant of the main game, so the comments and feelings it imbues are much the same as the original. It's still engaging enough to get lots of replay. With fewer cards in play, there's less downtime than the original and that's a plus. It's also more family and social friendly - pictures just seem more "fun" than words, in the same way that family and social gamers might favour Pictionary over Scrabble. I prefer the original Codenames because it provides a bit more scope for finding and enjoying cleverness, but this provides a nice lighter mode if there's a need. Same rating as the original.

Just like the original you split up in teams and try to get your team to guess which cards in a grid are indicated to be yours. You do this by giving only single word clues and a number representing the number of cards matching your clue. The only difference with the original is that there are pictures rather than words on the cards. This opens it up to a lot of interpretation but is just as fun.

Codenames Pictures, like its sibling Codenames, is a team-based word association game, where one player is the clue-giver and tries to come up with a one-word clue that describes as many of his cards on the grid as possible without describing cards that aren't his.  The big difference here is that the cards being described are pictures and not words.  The pictures in the game are fanciful and often combine elements that one usually wouldn't expect, such as a windmill with dragonfly wings or a hairdryer with snowflakes coming out of it.  The pictures are all black-and-white, presumably so people didn't focus on the color (and it's expressly forbidden to refer to shading).  I enjoyed the pictures, but they only faced one direction and often had details that were easy to miss from far away.  On the whole, I enjoyed this about the same as I enjoyed Codenames--that is, I find being the clue-giver to be a fascinating logic puzzle, but being a guesser is somewhat lackluster.

After the success of Codenames, they could have just used any pictures at all and sold a gazillion copies of this. Instead, they had really clever illustrations made. The pictures are subtle and allow for multiple different associations.
I don't really like this as a large-group game, though, because the pictures require looking closer than words do. It's too easy for someone sitting across the table to mistake (say) a clam shell for a mushroom. But I prefer it over original Codenames as a two-player game.

Csak pár dologban tér el a "nagy testvértől", itt ugye, ahogy a névből is látszik szavak helyett grafikák vannak, a másik változás pedig, hogy nem 5x5-ös hálót kell kirakni, hanem 5x4-et.
Ennek ellenére a többi dolog hasonló, azaz van két csapat (kék és piros), mindkét csapatnak van egy-egy kémfőnöke, akik a kihúzott kód alapján igyekeznek olyan szavakat mondani, ami a lehető legtöbb olyan kártyát "lefedi", ami az ő csapatjukhoz tartozik.

Úgy látom, hogy a pictures-ben könnyebb dolga van, mind a kémfőnöknek, mind a kémeknek.

I thought I would like Codenames with pictures more than Codenames with words. I don't. 

The art is too simple and straightforward, somehow it feels like the cards have fewer possible interpretations or descriptive possibilities, not more. No more "go big or go home" hints of 4+,  even 3 is rare.

Actually easier to play than the word version and with fewer cards. It is still possible to have unbalanced picture groupings but if anyone is playing this seriously then they have bigger issues. Excessive discussion can make the game run long and it is possible to offend people with some of the joking that comes with it.

After playing both games for awhile, I've finally come to the conclusion that Codenames:Pictures is better than Codenames. I am more willing to play Pictures than the original and I think I find it more fun. It might be that I'm just being a bit of a contrarian. I'm not sure. But I feel like the games of Codenames Pictures that we've had were just more fun in general. It's more lighthearted. People don't get mad at each other for not understanding their clues or their interpretation of the pictures, but people sometimes do in the original. 

Maybe people think they can be "good" at Codenames or that certain players are good Codenames players, but people know that pictures are more interpretive and subjective. People often think that I'm a good Codenames player simply because I'm a good communicator. This is just not necessarily true. Its much more about the group and your ability to understand your group than your ability with words. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.7
Not nearly as good as regular codenames, mostly because the pictures are upside down to half the players.  Also, they really didn't need to go all Dixit and have stupid fantasy drawings.  I think I'd've been happier with clip art of actual objects.  As it is, you have to spend forever scrutinizing every picture to make sure there isn't a claw or fairy or machine on some obscure part of the picture (like tiny paw feet on a table, e.g.) before you can make your clue.  Then the responders have to look at every picture in minute detail to make sure they don't miss something, too.  

It's interesting enough and makes you play slower and longer and work harder, but that's not what I was looking for.

Summary: I'll skip listing the pros and cons and just compare it to Codenames. This is a much simpler game than the normal Codenames, which can be good or bad. If you're playing with kids then this works great. If you're playing with solid gamers, then it may become boring. If you're playing with non-gamers or kids, then I highly recommend this game. If you're playing with normal gamers, then I'd stick to classic Codenames.

Just like the original (except the matrix is 4x5 instead of 5x5), but with pictures instead of words.

I prefer the word version to the picture version.  Because the double meaning of words adds an interesting element.  But the picture version allows for some bigger plays in our experience.

In our first game, we were getting crushed.  Our opponents had one card left, we had 5.  But the clue "living" allowed all 5 cards to be identified for a surprise win.

I've heard playing with 20 dixit cards is also something to consider.  I think I'll try that in the future.   The Dixit cards are so beautiful to look at I think it would improve the game.

If you like Codenames, you'll likely like this as well. It's maybe a touch easier. I think I would prefer to have it be the same size grid as Codenames instead of one row smaller (which you can do with the promo tiles). It also makes it easier to fit everything in one box since you can use the same grid reference cards and tiles to signify the red/blue/bystanders. For an interesting challenge, mix the words with the pictures to make your brain really work to make connections.

RATING: 6
Bit of a rehash of the original word based game, but better for it - I think. 
The pictures in the game are suitably cryptic combinations of items, which allow you to link various ones with single words. Almost infinite replayability and the game can cope with almost any size of group.

Not a great or go-to game for me, but I'd certainly prefer playing this to the Word based Codenames version

A logical next step from the original Codenames.

Codenames: Pictures has fewer items per game from which the players must choose, 20 vs. the original's 25. But the surreal nature of the pictures means many people can interpret them differently, leading to more ambiguous clues.

i remember first playing this just after a game of vanilla Codenames. yikes! like pulling apart the velcro that holds in my brain and putting half of it back in upside down! other than that one very magical, very trying session it just hasn't stood out much from the crowd. my family might prefer the Pictures and assume it's easier to find a match, but i miss the twisty wordplay available in the base game. i prefer Duet to either of those (although it's actually more difficult to come up with strategic clues as a committee), and lately would rather suggest the runaway hit Deception: Murder in Hong Kong above any of that.

RATING: 7
I like Codenames: Pictures more than text Codenames for 3 reasons:

1. It is language independent. That won't matter for many people, but I enjoy playing Codenames Pictures in Esperanto with Esperanto speakers, for example, and I always play it with people who don't all have the same first language (playing the text version is less fun when not everyone understands the language of the word cards similarly well).

2. It neatly sidesteps the occasional debates and disagreements about whether a clue is legal, which come up in most word/clue type games like this and Taboo etc. (E.g. if the word is "science" can you say "scientist"? If the word is "hat" can you say "hate" or "hatch" or "that"? If the word is "car" can you say "chariot"? If the word is "goodness" can you say "badness"? If the word is "Richard" can you say "Dick"? If the word is "I" can you say "me"? etc etc etc.)

3. The cool well done surreal pictures are much more interesting & fun to look at than plain printed text.

:thumbsdown: The drawings are way more unambiguous than the words in its predecessor. In [i][b]Codenames[/i][/b], the tension is built upon you having to pay close attention to avoid confusing hints. This made it a fun challenge to link as many words as possible to one hint. Giving a confusing hint is much harder in [i][b]Codenames: Pictures[/i][/b].
:thumbsdown: The grid is smaller than in [i][b]Codenames[/i][/b], which makes a misunderstood hint more of a 'fatality' from which you can't recover.

As a follow-up to one of the best party games in years, Codenames Pictures is something of a letdown. That's weird too, because it feels like an obvious step. But the pictures simply are too easy to interpret compared to words, and it's too easy to make clues. I still need to try it combined with the original game, which I think should solve that problem nicely.

Like the rest of the Codenames family, I really enjoy this! The cards are very well done, but almost might be a bit too ambiguous sometimes and don't allow for quite as clever of clues. I think I prefer the original Codenames to both this and Deep Undercover, but this is still super fun and great.

I was a bit skeptical to try this game (mainly because I love the original so much, and was a bit bitter that the sequel was a pictures edition, instead of a straight-up expansion pack) - but I'm so glad I did come around and try this game!

The pictures themselves I find fascinating (and a bit trippy... I'm half-expecting some of these things to show up in my nightmares...), and I found the difficulty level to be somewhat on par with the original Codenames. The games moved a bit faster than the original Codenames, largely due to the smaller grid size. I also appreciated that the rules to this game provided clarification on a few points that we were uncertain about from the original game (e.g. how to handle a scenario where you want to give a clue that can have two different spellings, and you intend to mean them *both*...), while also providing elaboration on a few points that were specific to this new pictures edition.

One challenge that we found with this game was that the spymasters seem to have even more of a tendency in this game than in the original to stare at their own words very obviously (e.g. trying to pick up on details / similarities), so we all try to not be too obvious in our staring (and try not to pay too much attention to the spymasters' glances), in order to stick to the overall spirit of the game. It also is a bit difficult having the pictures only being oriented towards one side of the table (unlike the original Codenames, where each word is also printed upside down), but it's not a huge hindrance to gameplay - we simply allow the guessers to move about the table a bit to get a better view (keeping the map card hidden of course!)

I'm still eagerly awaiting a straight-up expansion pack (yeah, I know there's an adult version, but looking to keep this family-friendly...), but in the meantime, the pictures version has added a breath of fresh air to one of our family's favorite game concepts. We haven't yet tried playing the game with a combination of the original word cards and the new image cards, but I'm excited to try that too!

Overall, the slight advantage still goes to the original Codenames game, but it's closer than I would have expected.

[12 plays] I thought this might be easier than regular Codenames since it has pictures rather than words. In some ways it is, for instance you are guarantee to get a “1” clue just by saying the name of the main object on the card. But in multiple number clues, I’m not sure that’s true, since all pictures have multiple objects and meanings.

Overall, I think my brain works better for the word version, but I can see reasons to have both games and some people will definitely prefer one version over the other.

RATING: 9
Identical to codenames but the switch to using pictures gets a mixed review from me.  On one hand the game is now playable with people who aren't good at English and can be played in any language (positive); the downside is that the pictures hinder creativity -  similar to how when you read a book you create in your mind what the world and characters look like, but when you see a picture,  it's hard to imagine anything else and during game play it really feels like the clues given are less creative. 

I will give an honourable mention for some improved rules on the original game that's included in this one that should be used for both games.

It's basically the same game as the original except that the cards have weird pictures on them instead of words -- really weird! Still good, but I prefer words.

Codename: Pictures is the same as Codenames just that instead of words there are pictures. I had a similar experience with both game (review of Codenames below). I ultimately don't find myself preferring either one.


Review from Codesnames:
I really wanted to like this game, but it kind of fell flat. There is just too much downtime/thinking for a party game. I found it frustrating trying to think of clues that your teammates would get and would link to more than just two words. This is obviously easier if your team shares your random knowledge or have known you a long time, but this limits who you can successfully play this game with.

I feel that this game loses some of the substance the original has, since the grid is smaller yet the pictures are harder to come up with hints for. Love that it's language independent though, and the fact that it enhances the original, as the cards from both sets can be used to make one grid.

Having played Codenames: Pictures, I could not imagine playing this game any other way.  Part of the reason is that while the English language allows for multiple interpretations of many words, the images used in the pictures have so many different elements, that it makes it a real challenge to give good clues that apply only to the cards that you want.  As one player said, "This would make for a really cool tattoo."

Need to play more but seems a little harder and features less excitement because the connections can be streamlined by a strictly visual component. I guess metaphors are a thing so maybe not. Either way, very excited about the prospect of mixing this in with regular Codenames.

It tends to range between too easy and too abstract sometimes. I'd prefer its elder sibling "Codenames".

Finally got this game to the table at the start of 2018.  Compared to the original Codenames, I like this version more.  The reason being that the illustrations depicted are so random that it almost takes knowing someone *really* well in order to see what they see.  Even though it maintains some of that Codenames flavor, it's almost more like a social deduction game given my thoughts on knowing the clue giver and what types of clues they would give based on various random images.  

Looking forward to mixing clues from the original + pictures together to see how they play together.

A birthday present from my lovely wife, Emma! We've played several games already and I really like it. Even the two player version is good. The pictures seem more 'accessible ' than the words version (which somehow feels more 'dry'/'pure'). I like this version for its accessibility and the other version for its 'hardcoreness'!

RATING: 7
tl;dr: less than the sum of it's parts

This game takes [thing=178900][/thing] and injects some of those weird images you can find in [thing=39856][/thing] into it. Both games shine at what they do, but when put together, the result is less than the sum of it's parts. The giving of tips seems to be much easier than in vanilla codenames, and part of the joy in that game is how tricky giving good tips is.
The game is still fun and worth playing, but if you have access to the original, I would opt for that version. Unless maybe you're playing with kids.

Codenames is great and I was fully expecting this game to be just as good, but unfortunately the system just doesn't work as well with pictures.

The main problem is that it's a lot harder to give multi-word clues that relate to the pictures. With the original Codenames, there are so many different meanings and associations that you have a lot of room for clever clues. With pictures, you just have to hope you get a good grouping that have some similarities.

The rulebook has a variant where you combines this version with the original and I actually want to see if that will work out better. For now, though, I would never choose to play this version over the original.

RATING: 7
One of the most popular party games to come out in recent years and its very appealing to everyone, even non gamers. 

The goal is to give one word clue that relates to certain number of cards. The first team to guess all of them are the winner. It gets better when there's chatty people giving mis-directions. It has since come out with many different IPs and I wouldn't mind trying them out. Always a blast.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Slightly easier than the original, and more approachable for younger kids. Not just because it's reading independent, but also because it's incredibly easy to get just one card if that's what you need. I actually think it's easily justifiable having both versions in the same collection. Codenames is still the best party game I've ever played.

This game is very much on par with the original Codenames. Only difference (mostly) is that it changes word cards for picture cards. This version is much easier IMO for newer players to become immersed in the game, because pictures have much more obvious relations than words. The change from words to pictures is nice and all but my favorite part of this game by far are the pictures themselves. Most of them are very creative and thought provoking! Really, they are perfect for a game like this. Some are even worthy of being blown up and hung on a wall. I recommend this game to everyone with an extra $20 in their pockets. 

PS this game can be combined with the original for more variety.

Good game. Pictures might be easier to play for younger players, but I prefer classic Codenames to the visual variant.

The images only having one orientation is also a bit of a let down. I'd rather have larger cards that show the image both ways (like classic codenames does) as I've seen a lot of people having to spin the cards around so they can see them.

Codenames: Pictures is essentially the same game as the original with only a few slight differences, the main one being that the game uses pictures instead of words. The pictures are often intentionally ambiguous having multiple elements in them. This change meant that you often had to study the tableau a bit more than in the original, as you had to identify what was going on in the picture and sometimes look at elements that weren't obvious at first glance. This is probably the reason that the tableau has 20 cards instead of the 25 from the original.

The switch from words to pictures did make it feel like I was using a different part of my brain when playing, which was odd at first, but quickly became unnoticeable. The change also obviated the need for funky "word" rules like the one from the original game where you can't say part of the written word as your clue.

There's not much else that's radically different from the original game here. There's more character art on the team cards which is nice. I do think I enjoy the pictures version slightly more then the original, but it's a close thing. Honestly, the main reason I wanted this version was so that my 6 year old daughter could play without being challenged by unfamiliar words.

[thing=198773][/thing] is [thing=178900][/thing] with, as the name mentions, pictures instead of words. The images have multiple elements, which can lead to several possibilities of meaning and understanding - a rich ground for the spymaster.

This is the good part. The bad is that this wider field leads to increase in AP of the spymasters, trying to fit more answers to the clues, and the same goes to the players trying to make sense of the clues. Since my gripe with [thing=178900][/thing] was the downtime, just scratching my chin, waiting to do something. [thing=198773][/thing] makes this worst whille not truly adding much in terms of fun - there is a little more possibility in making mistakes, due to the bigger openness in meanings, yet the counterpoint is, often, safer - and more boring - clues.

Overall, [thing=198773][/thing] is simply a worst, for me, than the original. Not by a whole lot, mind you, and not bad enough that I would refuse to play - just weak enough for me to think in several other party games I enjoy much more.

Played this a handful of times. As compared to its brethren, there isn't exactly too much of a difference. We noted that both words and pictures utilize slightly different mental faculties to process or form clues, but in the end of the day, pictures may end up slightly easier. With words, a certain amount of imagination is needed to form associations. With pictures, there is a "narrower" range of possibilities framed by each picture. This means for some folks, the original "codenames" offers more flexibility and choices, which may be a good or bad thing depending on the composition of the teams. 

With both sets of codesnames, I intend to mix and match the clues or play alternating words and pictures for variety.

Codenames: Pictures uses the same formula as the base game but expands upon it with wait for it...pictures.

Codenames pictures could have easily been poorly executed; instead we got a masterful rendition of the concept. The smaller board and (of course) the pictures give this a distinct feel from the original. Only thing I dislike is that there's too few cards (understandable as artwork costs more). The language independence is also a plus.

Codenames with pictures. After first game I feel I like the original better. Of course pictures are language independent.

Quick, fun and plays a crowd. It's a great alternative to games like Dixit when you want more player interaction and conversation.  I vastly prefer this version to the original as it makes it more accessible to everyone.

I like this better than vanilla Codenames, but I seem to be in the minority in my group. It's a bit easier, I think, with less potential for super clever/creative moves, but there's less time spent thinking, which makes it a win for me. Also less rules ambiguity since there are no words on the cards for your clues to collide with.

I like this better than regular Codenames.  I like That the pictures give you more things to try to make connections, and I like that it makes it more challenging.  Great party game one that I will keep in my collection.

A nice evolution of the game.  I'm indifferent to one version or the other.  I can get over the pictures being only in one direction.  Perhaps even easier to choose words given the photos.

While I think Codenames: Pictures is much inferior to the original word version, it still can be fun in the right group. It just requires a different kind of thinking. I would always pick the words over pictures though.

I like the new square cards, but it drives me nuts that the rules say to lay them out in a non-square grid. What was the point, then? I also find this version easier (and therefore less interesting) than the original version, because there are no taboo words.

Halfway through my first play, I thought I had made a big mistake by purchasing this as base Codenames is just as fun. However, after finishing a game and playing several more, I think I enjoy this. It seems faster as it's easier to find multiple-case hints due to the strangeness of the artwork.

Review Date: May 2017

Positives: Simple to learn. Gateway game and plays very well with social groups. Short play time and good value for money. 

Negatives: Maybe a little boring after a while? The pictures can be harder to see from the other side of the player board, unlike the word version which duplicates them

Conclusion:  The picture variant of the ever popular word game Codenames. If you have a large group who are not into board games as a rule, this is a very easy sell and fun to play. Might be too light for heavier gamers

Score 7 if it is your thing

My impression is that fans are finding this version to be inferior to the original, but I'm happy with either.  The dual nature of the drawings - two striking objects per illustration, all of which are unusual - leads to some slick clue opportunities.

In all versions, everything rests on the shoulders of the clue-givers.  A person without a creative itch is a person without a clue.  Literally.

[i]Update:[/i]

I've learned that it's easy to read upside-down words, but not easy to comprehend upside-down, multi-faceted drawings. This means that clues can be goofy, misleading, or just plain wrong unless the clue-givers circle the table to view the illustrations from their proper perspective.  That's inconvenient and annoying.

I found this to be fun but only once the group were 'into it' and 'getting the point'. They were slow so I don't think this is typical for most groups. However being this was a family event it was a painful experience at the beginning. One they got it though we were rocking and all having a good time. There are moments when you want to shout at the other team 'pick a damn card'. So we found the App for your phone that you can download tremendously useful for keeping the game going forward at a reasonable pace. 

Overall it was a great party game and when you have the right group you'll find you want to play again and again.

I think I've only played the PICTURES variant once. It's as fun as regular Codenames but... honestly I think the pictures thing really takes away from the whole language/vocabulary challenge aspect and makes it almost Dixit-like, or similar to Cards Against Humanity, where it's more like "What will resonate with my audience" instead of "What does this MEAN and what does it NOT?" -- not to say connotations and denotations of words don't play into regular Codenames in sometimes a slang or personal way, just that there is a more cultural commonality in playing the language version and something more abstract, or creative, or sometimes very personal and subjective in the picture version. Then again, I've never played either version of this game with non-native English speakers.

Intriguing game of vocal prompts that correlate with pictures, with my graphic design (visual) friends, it goes over very well. Great for 4 people, probably won't ever play with more or less, unless 2v3 if 5 people really want to play, but at that point i would rather play something else.

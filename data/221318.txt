RATING: 9.5
Picked this up at GenCon50 and absolutely love it! The game rules are simple enough that my wife will play it but the strategy is complex enough that I will enjoy it. The addition of more special tiles than you can use in a game and the variable placement of tiles in a game means replayability is very high. The artwork and colors are beautiful, components are high quality and the rules are very well written. My only (very minor) complaint is that some of the final scoring rules were a little ambiguous. But that was cleared up on a forum post. This one will hit the table a lot!

This is not a train game. The only thing remotely remotely railroad themed are the train meeples. You are not building routes. You are not delivering goods from one place to another. People are referring to this as "pick up and deliver." It is not that. You are collecting coloured cubes. You are fulfilling contracts with them.

Now that that's out of the way, this is a fine euro game with a strong spatial puzzle element. It's at least 85% tactical, as you respond to the dynamically changing board, although there is a strategic layer as you might work throughout the game to fulfil certain high-scoring goal tiles or to corner the market in particular stocks.

There is a good degree of player interaction as people jostle for position on the board and a few powers can have direct, negative effects on others. The board is created during the game, and this is bound to produce great game-to-game variability.

Although made up of grab-bag of mostly-familiar mechanics, they're put together in a way that feels as fresh as anything I've come across in a long while.

My only warning is that the AP potential is great, because the game state can change drastically between your turns. 5 players = lots of downtime.

Played prototype. Lots of opportunity for clever play in both tile laying and in where to send your trains. Tension in balancing setting up recurring routes to pick up points and special tokens with getting your trains to the western cities for big payouts. Lots of variability in play based on the city and intermediate tile setup.

I think this is a solid game with some unique and interesting elements, but it's ultimately one that I want to like more than I do. I simply don't feel enough tension when playing it and for a game this light, the pick-up and deliver portion just doesn't quite hold my interest as much as I would like.

First Play: Curious game that took me 80% of the playing time to work out a point scoring strategy. It then struck me that I had to get all three of my trains off the board and managed to scrape it by turn 10. I guess second play will be different but I'm in no rush for the second game.

Not sure what the hype is about with this game. I only have one play in but not too interested in playing again. First player seems to have quite a benefit. Also actions seem fairly constrained. Theme lost a little having to "burn" whistles to use them and tracks all twisted... similar to tsuro with tile laying. Just didn't translate well for me.

A cute puzzler, but the VP allocations seem way off (10 points seems to have inconsistent value in this game), and there's definitely some luck. Tiebreaking rules for stock certificates are dreadful. Still, a nice thinker to pass some time.

December 2017:  Sorta chaotic, sorta tactical, route builder.  Work your trains to get the most points in a variety of different ways.  Production is excellent, graphics are nice, gameplay is nice, too.  I do like games like this.  If felt less like a train game that it lets on but still good.  Be ready to pounce on opportunity!  I did lose because I let myself slide on getting the big bonus points at the end and did not get enough.  I want to play again.

Well conceived medium euro-style tile-laying race game. It's not 'pick-up-and-deliver' but 'collect-and-pay'. The potential chaining affects for points during a turn can be as exciting as it is AP inducing. After a single play at 3p, I can tell that it would be better with more rather than less.

Nice train game with a good blend of tactical scoring, end-game strategy, some slight player screwage, and a little bit of luck. You really do need to plan for your endgame (and you need to time it properly), but you also need to be flexable, adapting your plans as new tiles continue to come out. It's fun. Unfortunately, components are pathetically bad, though, with an extremely thin, warping frame and very cheap-feeling tiles.

A really straight forward and simple rules (but not easy!) optimization game of moving trains around a mess of railroad track, picking up goods along the way to deliver for points.

Most of this game hinges on the ability to identify easy and profitable loops and routes to exploit, as you only have so much fuel to move your trains around, so you need to be very efficient. If you have a group that's prone to AP, this could be a problem, as the options in this game are numerous, and you're searching for the best of those options.

I felt like down time was a bit much with 5, but can also see the game getting a little less interesting with less players, as there's a majority mechanism in trading in goods for shares in various companies, which would be less interesting at lower player counts.

Even though this game doesn't really do anything new or innovative, it's a very pleasing take on pick-up and deliver. Looking forward to playing this one again, as I like these optimization puzzles, especially when there's a map involved that you can study and help form in order to discover optimal routes.

Gamer Tsuro is the best way to describe this as you are building paths with your tiles to try and get to the other end of the board. There are some fiddly movement rules such as you can use coal to pass through your own trains, but not those of your opponent seems odd to me. I like the idea of building the board as you go and the random setup of the first column, fourth column, and last column definitely adds to the variability and I like the penalty of 10 points for not playing a special tile since it forces these to come onto the board. However, there was just nothing exciting about this game like most pickup and deliver games it feels rather procedural. Move to a space, collect a good, and on a later turn move to another space and turn it in for a stock or special power. No sense of building up anything just moving along and taking your actions. It makes for a rather smooth playing game, but one that is not very exciting. Finally, the pastel colors are an interesting choice. I get why they made the decision, but man do they look weird on the board.

This is a color blind nightmare and is unplayable.  The colors on the tiles are unidentifiable and a few of the cube colors are too close to each other.

RATING: 7
This is a solid couple steps up the complexity scale from Ticket To Ride, without it feeling too heavy, like Age of Steam or something. Although it's actually significantly more thinky than the name and art might suggest. The only randomness in the game is the tile draws, but it doesn't really make a huge amount of difference, because you have a bunch of trains on the board, and can use everyone's tiles. Personal tiles placed just means that the player who places them is the first one to use them. You generally are moving trains from one side of the board to the other, and the spaces on the far side have goals for specific resources, so you want to collect those by the time you get there. There's a little stock game thrown in where you get a share of stock by completing a small order on one of the company spaces, which also gives immediate VP. My only real concern is that each company has 6 shares, and at the end game whoever has the most (tie broken by whoever got the first share among those tied) gets 15 points. with no payout for 2nd place. It's a huge swing when two players each have 2 shares, and one player gets nothing for it. If nothing else, I would strongly emphasize that to new players. The game also has special bonus tiles, which can be bought with resources, which give the owning player a special power. At least one of them I know I hate: One tile lets you search through the draw pile of tiles rather than picking from the visible set of 3. That's an incredible drag on the game. I would ban that in my games. Other than that, pretty enjoyable.

Maybe I went in with the wrong idea, but this game really let me down.  First, there's no real interesting combo potential here.  It's mainly: get a power (from a gear, or from parking a train at a station) and repeat the same actions over and over again.  And some of the gears (or track loops) felt like cheating, especially the caboose (spend a coal to re-use the spot you're on).  

Your turns consist of micro-actions, which makes completing a minor goal very clunky.  And the goals themselves are simple recipe fulfilment.  I don't mind recipe fulfilment, but here it's just "trade two of these cubes for some points and a stock."  And the stocks matter because that's the bulk of the scoring, at least in 2p.  

There's no interesting tableau building.  There's no interesting financial management.  There's no interesting interactions on the board (think Via Nebula, or Brass, or Concordia).  It's very solitaire, just a race of cube collection and recipe fulfilment.

It's a shame because the game is SO BEAUTIFUL.  Oh well, off to purgatory.

After a single play, this seems to be the best of the hex-laying, route-building, PUD genre - still not one I particularly enjoy. I would play this again, though. It's certainly better than RotW, AoS, Steam, Via Nebula, and the horrible 1830.

Cons seem to be a board state that changes so much after each player that thinking ahead is mainly pointless, and endless unintentional getting in each other's way.

Tough game to rate because I misunderstood so many rules.  Ultimately there's too much AP in this game.  4 trains...each with multiple directions.  You can move them 1 space with coal or 2 with a whistle.  And you really need to plan out all 4 of your moves each turn.  Can really drag.   Starting it at a 6.  Not sure it will go up mich.  Horrible game for color blind ppl.  Brown, grey, green spots in the board all look alike!

This game was OK, but it felt like an attempt to stitch together several mismatched games in a working, but not fantastic patchwork. In the the 5 player game I played at least, the board game quite chaotic and you spend a good amount of time just reacting to it and less time planning long term. Some concepts as the final train bonus, variable board, and simple action play are all positives. Drawing and playing terrain tiles was more of an activity than a strategy (and can be painful if you have an unlucky draw late in the game) and the tie breaks on stock majority are too difficult to overcome for players in the back of turn order.

Glad the game was created and I had a chance to try it, but I doubt people will look twice in a year.

The tracks run together like the tracks in metro and belong to no one.    Goods on a stop do not run out & can be repeatedly acquired by all.  I like the way stocks are purchased along the route with goods.  Lots of choices--can always find something to do even if plans are disrupted by others.   Individual boards are designed so that upgrades nicely fit  into spaces with cogs.  Game lays out differently every time.

I don't like the flimsiness of the puzzle board and I am weary of the cubes picked up by most train games.

Very cool game where the mechanisms quickly fade to the background which allows you to focus on strategy and tactics. It has a nice level of player interaction without it being too mean.

There's a lot you can do in the game and a big part of it is trying to be as efficient as possible and trying to get the most points out of every turn. But timing is also a big factor, especially in when to retire your trains. Good stuff.

Good gameplay, and a really fun tactical/strategic puzzle.
Some Upgade Cards are better than others, for roughly the same cost, so it is up to the players to "balance" the game by buying the upgrades from eachother.

Rulebook it definetly not the greatest, as several common board states that come up during the game (eg what if you have several of your trains in a line, how do you move...) are not explained properly. And the game badly needs a player aid for the upgrade cards and a summary of final scoring.

After only two plays, it is quite clear to me that playing the game with five players give you way less control than playing the game with fewer players. Four players have taken their actions (up to 16 actions in total!) since your previous turn, changing the board state dramatically. Also you have less trains to do actions with, increasing the risk to get badly shafted, with no good moves left for you to do. 
So in my opionion the game is much more enjoyable with 3-4 players compared to playing with the full player count. The two player game I can't comment on...

A mix of collecting cubes to deliver and Tsuro path laying. The game lasts a set amount of rounds. On your turn you can generally move your train 1-4 times, depending on how much coal/whistles you have to burn. Because you only get 2 coal most rounds and other trains may be in your way, you may save some of your coal for future rounds.

I was very much looking forward to this game, but sadly, I was thoroughly disappointed.  Turns consist mostly of moving a train one hex and then collecting the one cube on that hex.  Sometimes you get to trade in a few cubes for a stock.  Overall, rather lifeless and dull.

Whistle Stop provides a surprising amount of tough decisions given how simple its rule set is. What could have been a simple game of picking up and delivering goods gets supercharged thanks to having to manage resources, lay down tiles to create the board, play the stock market metagame, and consider acquiring and using upgrades. Anyone looking for something a bit more involving than an entry-level Euro game would do well to take a look at Whistle Stop.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with Whistle Stop, but neither is there anything particularly special about it. Players have a set of trains that they are trying to move from one end of the board to the other, collecting upgrades, resources and company shares along the way. 

Movement is governed by whistles and coal, which can be scarce if you are not planning how to acquire more than the 2 coal you are given every turn. The tracks twist in all sorts of directions and players have a hand of track tiles and locations they can play when a train would run off the board. Locations allow for the acquisition of shares and points for resources, more coal, more resources, and gold - each of which has a variable value that is added at game's end. While it is tempting to set up production and purchasing loops from which you could extract big value, the game is too short to let you get carried away with it. The end can come surprisingly fast and there are potentially big point bonuses for getting across the map that are easily overlooked. Share majority bonuses in the 5 companies are all or nothing and have a big influence on the final score. This is partially balanced by leftover rare resources having significant point values as well.

The rules are simple and the game is easy to teach. There is more opportunity between your multiple trains for surprising and efficient maneuvers than at first may appear. The issue, I think, is that the game doesn't really differentiate itself. I have simple, puzzley contract fulfillment games already. There isn't quite enough interactivity between the different elements to engage me at a deeper level. As someone who has played and rated almost 1000 games and has seen all of this before, I don't feel like this game was designed for me.

Enjoyed this. Was originally interested b/c it's a train game, but it doesn't bear much similarity to other train games I like. I was disappointed with how the "stock" system had very little to do with actual stock market mechanics, but once you get past that it makes for interesting game play.

It's more like a traditional euro, as you spend a lot of time planning out how to get resources and convert them into VPs efficiently. There is tension between getting the resources you want for your upcoming moves and planning for your trains to all get to the end stations, which are worth the most points. I also liked the double restriction on actions (you need to spend coal, and you can't spend more than 4 per turn) as it feels both economic and tactical.

Long story short, it presented interesting problems to solve and didn't overstay its welcome.

We really enjoy Whistle Stop. It is a great next step in train game complexity. The spatial resource gathering loop is an interesting and unique mechanism. And the stock-market-as-set-collection is a wonderful introduction to heavier 18XX games.

- The Tsuro-esque tile placement is really clever. You can do some silly, circuitous routes to get to the towns or resources you need.
- Coal is the most common movement resource, but it also restricts your movement. This can lead to some tough decisions on where or how you move your trains, or when to time your Whistles, which allows you more flexibility.
- It's rule-light, and what you're doing turn-by-turn is fairly straightforward. This makes the game easy to teach.
- Upgrade actions add a bit of extra variety, in that it can open up additional avenues of scoring, or extra actions to make getting resources easier.
- Similar to point above, there is a ton of replay value in this game.
- Artwork is great! Reminiscent of some 2000's PC sim tiles, like Roller Coaster Tycoon or OpenTTD.

Cons:
- So far it looks like this game can have some serious downtime between turns at higher counts.
- Minor nitpicks on the choice of the graphic design (1st Class Cabin upgrade, the plus signs on the Trade Post). Otherwise, it's clear and provides enough readability on what you can do.
- Agree with others that, the rulebook could've benefited from another editing pass-through.

Overall, I'm feeling really good about my Whistle Stop purchase. It's very reminiscent of Suburbia or CoMKL, in that they are straightforward, replayable games with strategic depth. For me personally, it's one of the best games released in 2017.

It's good! If you like medium-weight Euros, this is a solid purchase. Whistle Stop also gives you an excuse to make choo-choo noises, which I can only imagine is a good thing.

A very well designed pick-up-and-deliver type game, surprisingly thinky, with depth of decisions that can occasionally lead to AP.  Very good at two player, & I would like to try it at three - but I wonder if it might become frustrating at four.  Update tiles seem underpowered thus far.  I have yet to win, being trounced royally.  If you can't read a map, and you can't parallel park - I'll bet you can't win this game.  Still fun though!

I can't give any meaningful thoughts after 1 play.  Very straightforward pick up and deliver game with path building and quite a bit of resource management.   Looks like it will be highly re-playable due to the tile placement portion of the game.

Shares some similarities with Via Nebula - sharing routes, picking up goods.  Via Nebula feels like a tougher/tighter game, though.

Would like to play again, but not one I'll be running out to grab ASAP.  Feels like a game that may grow on me with more plays.

After playing this twice I was done with it. There is too much randomness in parts of this game that really turned me off.

The biggest disappointment was in my second game. On my turn I played two tiles and had to draw two more to refill my hand. I ended up drawing two special tiles off the top of the stack (all tiles in the supply were special as well). The next player got their last train off the board on the next turn ending the game so I was stuck with two tiles that caused me to lose 20 points and come dead last. I wouldn't have won the game without those tiles but that bit of randomness ruined the entire game for me. Since it was not the 'last round' according to the number of rounds played in a 5p game I couldn't skip filling my hand.

The above makes me think this game didn't have enough development. Sadly this seems to be the story for many games Bezier has put out in the past couple of years.

Really nice tile laying/resource collection game with some interesting decisions to make. I'd make it a 7.5 or 8 if not for the singularly badly thought out colour scheme: making one player colour light green when the board is light green is bizarre, and the green and blue cubes and brown and grey are virtually indistinguishable. This is a game that cries out for aftermarket upgrades. Still, that gaffe aside, recommended.

It was alright, I guess. The route building is pretty fun, though I felt like the rest of the game was fairly procedural. Also, what's up with that board?

Steam is still my go to game in this genre, and it has no chance of being unseated anytime soon.

Whistle Stop is a tile-laying pick-up-and-deliver game where players each control a number of train tokens, trying to get from the East to the West, picking up resource cubes, gold, and stock certificates along the way. The tiles are hexagonal and most have a random arrangement of track configurations that could send you in any direction, along with some spots to pick up resources. Others have large depots where you can trade goods for stock, or pick up a few other items. The main resource in the game is coal, but this only lets you move forward--if you need to move back, you need to use a special whistle resource. Along the west side of the board are a bunch of spots where you can trade in resources for big points or trade in excess stock for points. For each stock type, the majority owner gets 15 points and everyone else gets nothing. I hadn't seen a Metro-like tile-laying system with a pick-up-and-deliver mechanism attached to it, so that was a bit refreshing. However, nothing about the game really stood out, and the conceit of needing to use whistles to go backwards seemed a little overblown to me.

After wanting this game and finally watching it in play, I can't say I'm as excited as I was before. The map looks crazy busy and this is basically Tsuro with pick up and deliver and recipe fulfillment. I'm not entirely sure this would even be worth it in my collection as I'd rather play Steam if I want a light train game or Indigo if I want a path type game.

The rules are for me not the clearly written (simply defining what a stop is by showing it on the map/tiles would already help) and it made I had some low expectations of this game.

In this game, players start their trains on one end of the board. On your turn, you can take up to four actions, by spending a coal or whistle token to move your train and resolve the action on the spot you land in. These action spots will mostly either collect you a cube of a specific color, allow you to spend sets of specific cubes for points and a stock marker. There are a few other special tiles you might find, but they're the exception. The movement trick is that the trains can't move backwards in the tile columns  without a special effect. This means that as you progress, your options are more limited. To a certain extent this is fine, because there are big rewards for getting your train to the far side of the map.

Budgeting your actions can be tricky, as even though you can resolve four actions, you only get the action tokens to resolve two actions during the income phase each round. This pushes you to try and find extra action tokens through special effects on the board to keep your engine running so to speak.

The game ends one of two ways, either when one player has gotten all their trains to the far side of the board, or when the round timer runs out.

At the end of the game, players score extra points for stocks they have the majority of, with ties broken by who bought the stock first. This feels a little strange, since if I'm the first to get a color of stock, it takes a single player twice as much work to beat me for it, when I'm also getting the advantage of being ahead in traveling to the far side of the board, but possibly this is a forking strategy, where one player might focus on getting as far along as they can, and another might work on staying back and collecting stocks? It also felt a little odd for there to be a substantial VP bonus for majority stockholder, but nothing for even 2nd place in each stock.

Overall the tight game timer makes the game a faster play than steam, but for some reason it doesn't feel as satisfying. The AP is still quite high. Cubes, despite being theoretically unlimited, as you get one from the supply any time you stop on a space, feel like they are in short supply. The rails on the hex tiles have so many paths, and you have several trains, that it can feel hopeless to figure out what your best move at any given time is. Moves usually feel more or less equitable, although that could be lack of experience on my part.

I'd like to play this some more, but so far it hasn't sung to me in the way I had hoped when I originally saw the design of the game.

The more I play the more I realize rushing all of your trains off the board to end the game is the strongest strategy. Hanging back to fight for stocks doesn't usually pay off. Make a plan for every resource you collect and try to end the game while the other players are busy.  Always hear a lot groans when someone announces they are finished.

This is not a traditional train game, that you would expect to be rife with stock manipulation and investment in other players holdings. It's more of a points puzzle, and an un-engaging one at that. There is promise of depth in Whistle Stop, at least in my first play experience. By executing a long-term plan I had held out on the entire game, I snatched second place coming from last in a 5 player game, without running a single train completely across the map. I am just not sure I wish to play further to explore other possibilities.

My primary issue is the king-making allowed by a perplexing design choice that lets you steal upgrades from other players, who may have spent several turns planning and earning the resources required to buy them. Yes, the fee is slightly exorbitant for the stealing player, but this does not translate to the effort expended by the player being stolen from having previously earned their upgrade. I will be frank, and say this victim was indeed me, but it did leave a sour taste in my mouth. In a game of five players, I was the only one who worked to obtain the maximum of three upgrades, while all others had 1 or none. No one thought to purchase any upgrades until they felt it convenient to take mine, when they happened to have the requisite number of cubes lying around and had no other meaningful actions to do on their turn. Worse, they took them NOT for the abilities, but for their measly endgame bonus points. They became some low hanging fruit which I was beholden to others' whims to pick, and my planning and resource management for several turns was all for naught. All the while, these players just so happened to be able to execute their own agendas for themselves on their turns.

As an alternative, it would be far more palatable if the resources paid for the stolen upgrade went to the player being stolen from, to at least make up for the price, or at minimum, let the player being stolen from have their choice of the premium cube color.

The other prevailing problem is the odd penalty of losing *FIFTEEN* points per station tile which you retained in your hand at the end of the game. How this design decision is justifiable or even thematically sensible is beyond me. Suddenly, an undesirable, unmitigated, push-your-luck scenario rears its ugly head in the endgame. When there are little to no open spaces left to place tiles, it is possible that in a single draw, you are punished simply because you so happened to pull a station tile. You draw at the end of your turn, if you have less than three tiles, so the choice becomes: expand and risk losing 15 points, or stay put and let others race past you. It is a oddly-punishing, luck-driven element that seems to exist "just because."

So, it is with these absurd design choices present, and the fact that the first play itself failed to enthrall me, that I do not think too highly of Whistle Stop. It simply drags at higher player counts, and the actions are VERY repetitive. To that end, if I wanted to play what should be an interactive train game at low player counts, I would likely not be choosing a train game at all.

(+) Interesting mishmash of mechanisms that keep you thinking.
(+) Pleasant aesthetics. Pleasant, not functional.
(+) Rewards long term planning (barring a major fault)

(-) Planning and developing upgrades can be gutted by other players with no way to defend.
(-) Terrible pastel color choices that are not colorblind friendly in the slightest.
(-) A slog at high player counts--AP Prone and repetitive.

A light variant of pick up and deliver, in that each stop has an unlimited number of resources, so each train stopping there gets to pick up that resource. You are moving your trains west trying to get the right mixture of 3 resources to deliver them to western end stops, for points but most importantly for a boost of extra tokens/resources and each train is 1/5 towards ending the game. To win, it seems you really need to race to get all your trains to end before other players as each train still on the board is 10-25 lost points, so it seems that messing around with fighting over majority control of stocks was just pasted on to the game and doesn’t really work. I won by a lot - it’s not a horrible game, but I don’t see any point playing again.

Very good train game where you have a lot of choices to make every turn. Do I grab a bunch of different stocks to cash in for points or try to grab majority shares.? Do I want to focus on upgrade tiles to be move more efficiently or grab gold? Do I want to get my trains off the board quickly for quick points or try to maximize my efforts and score the bigger tiles? It is a fun puzzle that offers different strategies in how you play. You can even make a loop and gather the same resources over and over and use your other trains to deliver them. I recommend this game to anyone that wants a step up from ticket to ride. Not hard to learn just has a lot of different choices to make which can lead to ap. I played a 5 player game where it take a bit to come around to you again but it gave me time to decide what I wanted to do on my next turn.  It’s a good meaty game that I enjoy immensely!

This game is super simple to play (though the movement rules in the book aren't the best) but man is it deep. AP players, let the paralysis begin!! There are soo many routes and options to consider, especially in the two player game, that it's considerably hard not to freeze up. I love the different logistics involved in the decisions. I do find that the shares are maybe a bit OP at first glance. But what do I know? Am just some dude. Definitely want to explore it more so that I can analyze that. Everything else is on point from the excellent production, to the graphic design, artwork, and huge variability. Oh and this game is ripe for expansions. Really excellent design and definitely top 10 of the year material for me.

A deceptively simple-looking game of pick-up-and-deliver. Players form routes with tiles are they push their trains across the board, and pick up resource cubes to exchange them for stock or straight-up VP once they reach the end of the route.

Despite the pastel-coloured hues (which may be confusing to colour-blind players or when playing in low lights), this is pretty brutal. Especially since the share system only awards points to the largest majority. Pretty interesting for what it is, but be warned - this is the sort of game in which your actions are heavily dependent on what others do before you, and so you often find yourself rethinking your actions when your turn rolls around.

tl;dr: nice, but sometimes frustrating

This is the kind of game we've come to expect from Bezier: accessible rules, well developed, plays well, good flow, good components. I found it quite enjoyable, as I do with most of the games they put out. I did get frustrated at some point though as everything I needed, including backup plans were blocked by other players for three rounds. I tried using my other trains to best effect, but I rand out of things to do in 2 turns, and those things were far from optimal. That was quite annoying. Maybe this wouldn't happen with only 3 players (we played with 4). You could say I could just skip those things, but by then I would be so close to the other side of the board it would be too expensive to go back, and if I wanted any chance of winning I needed to do at least some of the things I was trying to do.
But this was only the first play, so hopefully I'll get to try it again soon and we'll have a smoother game.

I love what the designers did with the color schemes. Because of the different upgrades and special tiles that are available, each game will be different.

Whistle Stop has a beautiful aesthetic. I love that it builds on the simple Tsuro/Indigo mechanic and offers so much variable setup.

I don't love the setup time required. I need to think harder about some storage solutions to make this process easier, but I fear it's always going to be a bit of a pain.

Big big fan of this one. It lived up to my personal hype and has become one my new favourites. I love how you can play the perfect turn using your trains in just the right order - very satisfying. I have played it with 2 and 4 players and enjoyed the game at both levels, leaning towards liking 4 best because of more player interaction.

My only complaint would be that the rulebook could be more specific to clarify certain situations that can arise.

Wife loves this game.  It's one of them easy, but still a ton of fun to play games.  When given the choice, it's my preferred options vs Ticket To Ride.

Initial rating after one play (4p).  Rules seem a little confusing until you lay out the game and then it all makes perfect sense.  I suspect this rating will stay the same or even go up with more plays.

On the fence about this one.
Like the road construction aspect of it, like less the blocking of other players as well as "stealing" abilities

Spaghetti railroad building. Limited actions, so better to run your trains on profitable routes.

Lay track and depot hex tiles within a jigsaw framed border.   Move trains along routes to pick-up-and-deliver color cube cargo with coal and whistle fueled action point rounds.  Gain stock majority, reverse movement whistle move big combos with the gear shaped upgrades, and the cross country train bonuses make this very interesting.

Easy to teach game with a lot of depth. However, the rulebook is lacking when it comes to explaining train movement. Terrible color choices for the colorblind that make the game nearly unplayable for them.

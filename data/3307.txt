I really enjoy the combination of wargame and euro.
I think the random order of the action cards is a great mechanic.
I just wish I could play it more!

I should like this but it doesn't quite work for me and I find it difficult to put my finger on why. I like the planning aspect but I can never seem to get myself excited about the wargame elements.

RATING: 5
Solid area-control game with alot of limited options.  Has some somewhat unsettling randomness (initial distribution of provinces, 5 blind actions, combat-although the cube tower is a pretty good innovation), but generally a very strategic, high quality game.  Appears to be very language dependent, but with the translations provided on this site, it's not a real issue.  El Grande is still the definitive area control game for me, but this one is worth owning and playing occasionally.

This is a very tense and demanding game. It's not light-hearted but a true gamer's game. Though it's about the 30 Year's War, the heart of it is actually a resources management game so battles take a backseat. Overall, it's a well thought out and balanced game.

Not for now. 150 minutes, 3 players. Great though.

RATING: 9
A great game! Players simultaneously decide their actions each action phase without the exact knowledge of which order the actions will be played in. This element of chance can be assuaged by good planning. I thought that the cube tower, which is used to resolve conflicts in the game, was an excellent alternative to dice rolling or simple mathematics since each outcome changes the bias of the cube tower on subsequent conflict resolutions. Overall, this is one of my favorite games in my collection at the present time, although I can imagine that there is enough chance present in the game to discourage those who are less partial to it than I am.

Very original war game. It is a sort of a mix between Puerto Rico and Risk. I just love it!

RATING: 4
In Dirk Henn land, you don't play the game, THE GAME PLAYS YOU!

In this game you commit to taking ten actions, but don't really know what order you are going to take the last five of those actions. As a result you are playing more against the game, while trying to squeeze in some player interaction on the side.

The cube tower is a fun novelty and the only reason to play the game.

See also Shogun.

Who needs Risk? I've got Wallenstein now, so not me. This game gives me the same feelings I remember having while being really into Risk, but there is just so much more game going on here. All I can say so far is that this is definitely one of the better games in my collection. However, it does not seem like a wargame. It fulfills a great role as a euro-style Risk like game that I think a lot of my friends would find appealing... if only I had this one during college!

The Cat's Pyjamas! This game is as good as I expected and hoped when I read about it here on the Geek. It took me a long time to acquire it when it was out of print and then a further time to actually play it, but it was worth the wait.

I love the tower and the constantly shifting order that things are done in. There is luck, but you can play cleverly to lessen that.

I don't agree that those in the corner always win.  I won on my first attempt and I was not in the corner.  I was mainly in the middle of the board - though I had a few territories near a corner.

It's a bit of a brain-burner with a large chunk of the unexpected thrown in.  I think some gamers might not like that random element, but I think it is often a part of great games.  In any case, I found that essentially if you decide what are your two main priorities for that turn and act accordingly, you will likely prosper.  Everything else should just fit around that.  I reckon attempts to get all 10 cards plays per turn totally right are doomed to failure, but then one should try not to make plays which are obviously too risky, either.

Great fun.  Serious, but not dull or too complicated.  The Art work is great, it's easy enough to print off the cards in English from BGG - and other parts of the German edition impart a lot of flavour, so why are you waiting for it to come out in English?  Get out and buy this one as soon as you can!

Fills my collection's wargame gap perfectly - you don't have to know the colour of Albrecht von Wallensteins socks to be able to play unlike most wargames. A wargame  people who don't care about history can play! [b]BONZA![/b]

RATING: 9
Having shifted the focus from just expanding territories to actually concentrate on building and keeping your provinces in supply, is what makes this game particularly good. Even though its a eurostyle wargame without a lot of conquest, then there are still a lot of conflicts resolving because of skirmishes and revolts.

From the Reviews: This looks fun and since I have heard that the dice tower isn't too bad of a thing to play with it might be a try, but only a reprint. There is no way I would pay collectors prices for this game

If you thought Shogun was bad then this is worse, allows turtling in corners, random action selection, punishment for being in the middle as easier access for attacks, random turn order. Nothing redeeming in this design at all for me.

Nice light wargame, not a great amount of combat since you will only be able to attack 12 times in a full game. Planning things right is essential and takes a lot of time for slower players. Much better than Im Zeichen des Kreuzes, you're actually playing against the other players this time.

RATING: 9.5
Great game with wonderful mechanics.  The changing action sequence forces continual reassessment and creates agonizing choices.  The chit tower is a unique way of resolving battles and is a classic.  Beautiful board and components.  Gets docked a tad for its horrendously written rules, which obscure rather than illuminate the play sequence, which is essentially simple.  This forces first-time players, who lack the aid of an experienced player, to spend a fair piece of time muddling through the first year of play until gradually it all begins to click.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
If you can get your mind around the impossible German names you will find a very entertaining resource management game with some conflict and a nice battle resolution system. The box say 3-5, but I have also played a few  2-players games using the variant described here. It worked very well. If I could choose I would probably trade it for Shogun, the art seems more interesting and colorful.

RATING: 7.8
A great game, for map reasons better than its brother Shogun.  As with any such attack-based multiplayer, there's some kingmaking, get-the-leader, popularity contest and 'let's you and him fight' instabilities to fight through, and perhaps the game is a little too kind on the turtles.  But if you're going to play one of the games where all of that is in the mix, Wallenstein would be my choice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

The tower is very cool and interesting, but cubes can get stuck in the edges.  Its a good game, I'd like it more if it were shorter.  Those who dont mind the longer games will probably like it a lot.

RATING: 8
Very nice mix of eurogame with wargame. It is an area control wargame but it is not always in your best interest to try to monopolize one region only. You need to spread out your influence generally to do well. There is also a nice mix of often subtle elements that make this so much more than just a wargame. The tradeoffs involved in managing your gold and food with the resulting revolts is neat. As is weighing the need to build buildings in your regions vs attacking other regions for their buildings. Throw in the Tower of Doom and the really nice way you plan out your turn then resolve the turn order. Overall a very solid game with lots for eveyone to like.

3-5(5)

Played with a two-player variant. The cube tower is fine and all (though I accidentally discarded the plastic bowl and funnel!), but the more interesting element of this one to me had been the programming element with only some amount of information of the year's events available, and how those would interact with the schedules of others.

Need to try again properly.

I really like this game... I can't explain why, I just do. Wish I could find others to play it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
There are two common problems with multi-player conflict games.  The first is A fights B and so C wins.  One way that Wallenstein tackles this is by giving each player a patchwork of lands and forces.  It is difficult to focus on attacking one opponent when everyone is a neighbour. Wallenstein also only gives you two opportunities to attack per season - and those attacks must come from different places.  

The second problem with multi-player wargames is downtime.  I take my entire turn and then kick my heels while four others do the same. Wallenstein sidesteps this by breaking each turn into ten brief actions that we all do in turn.

The system of action cards and action selection is at the heart of the game.  It generates many nail biting situations as you wonder whether you can achieve X before an opponent does Y.  I don't find the dice tower any more random than many combat results tables in "proper" wargames.  Wallenstein is a tricky balancing act between attack, defence, building and feeding your people.  It all fits together beautifully. 

The box artwork is pretty terrible, but that apart, the game is good looking and functional.  The rulebook is bizarrely ordered and a trifle vague.

My rating after a single game and I didn't truly play the whole game.  I sat in half way through the game playing te game owner's seat through the second year.  Although I understood the mechanics by watching most of the first year play out, I must say alot of strategies I failed to see until too late.  Still the first impression I thought was strong enough to earn a rating and I'm looking forward to playing this one again.

Man I love that tower.  I wish this got more gameplay than it does.  This is a game where Witheredhand will find a reason why he needs to attack me even if he has to go out of his way across the board to do so.

We choose starting regions by turning up 2 cards and giving the player a choice of one of these or the unturned card on the top of the deck.  This seems to work well and mixes things up a bit.

I have played this with some folks experienced in Risk but new to Euro games and they had a great time.

I prefer this edition over the Shogun edition.  I keep hanging on to Shogun, but we never play it.

Plays best with 4 or 5.

The tower is overrated/underrated.  Really, I don't see it as much different than dice or cards one way or the other as far as chance affecting gameplay goes.  Above average game that feels far too short.  I'd like to play it for another couple game years, but that would probably strain the food production mechanism too much.  I'd really like to see the turn planning mechanism applied to a more open (longer) wargame design.

It's a game with a very interesting scoring mechanic. Plus, the cube tower is a very nice gimmick. The problem is that the mechanics are quite chaotic, and there's not much in the "planning ahead" department. Nor in the "react immediately" either, for that matter. For such a cool concept, it's very poorly developed.

RATING: 8
Good mix of war and euro game.  Might be too war like for some and too euroy for others but looks a good fit for me.  Theme is present in esthetics and mechanisms.  It is a clean design but it does look a little like there is a lot of "see how it all pans out" for your decision time unless everyone is quick at excecuting your actions you have no choice over.  E.g. of the 10 actions in the game only 3 have any choices really attacked to them (movement and attack) everything is is just carried out automatically with almost no choices.  Some might be frustrated that combat is not all that rewarding but with the right group I can see this being a lot of fun.  One negative I have is that despite the simultaneous action selection the playing out of the actions can be a little slow for how few decisions there are but if everyone is working together its not too bad.  Also it is quite possible to be more or less out of contention after the first of 2 years but it is still fun to play.

I like Wallenstein quite a bit more than Shogun, though I'm not fully certain why.  (Note, I've played Shogun first -- it's not the whatever-I-first-played bias like I usually see on this site.)

One reason is that the start player each turn is determined randomly instead of players bidding for it.  While I can understand why gamers prefer the greater control and interaction with the auction, it's just one more decision to make in a game already crammed with paralysis-inducing decisions.  Having random turn order is a simplification that I welcome.

Another reason is that the board feels less claustrophobic than in Shogun.  Looks like the number of provinces is about the same, so I guess it's just the layout -- or maybe it's all in my head.  To me, though, Wallenstein encourages careful expansion and not stepping on each others' toes too much, while Shogun encourages fighting just to bash on the other guy.

Played a 5 user session as my first experience with the game.  I like the action card shop mechanism where the complete series of actions is not yet visible from the start and is to discovered progressively.  I also like very much the randomizing function the cube tower adds to the game for battles.

A lot of interesting decisions, but if other players choose to target you for some reason, then those decisions may be rendered meaningless.  Although it is a pretty lengthy affair, there's not much movement on the map, so it feels a little static.

RATING: 6
Seriously OVER-rated.  This game might belong in the top 500.  Luck heavy with only one good path to victory -- turtle, then rampage -- **year 1** choose provinces all over the map (don't concentrate much), build armies, build buildings, and don't attack (much) **year 2** attack the juiciest neighbors late in the game.  Any other approach is likely to spread your forces too thin, and you will lose.  The game is heavily spiked with luck from the cube tower and 3 decks of cards -- turn order cards, event cards & cards for the phases/actions for the round.  I have taken the game too seriously every time.  I need to relax and play this luck-fest quickly (and follow my aforementioned strategy).  Seems like over-taxing and/or over-harvesting a province or two is a good idea... you get the benefit before the revolt happens, and if you lose, it's only 1 VP... just earmark that province for food/gold production from the start of the game and don't build buildings there.  ONE FINAL POINT: if the pain (i.e. attacking) isn't evenly dealt to all players, the non-combatant(s) will likely grow strong and conquer war-torn provinces easily (and undeservingly??).

After having this game sit on our shelf for nearly 18 months, we finally downloaded the most recent rules translation, printed out English cards and got it to the table. About time, eh? And what a great game! I can't believe we let it sit on the shelf for so long. My only concern is that with some groups we play with, analysis paralysis is a serious concern, so a timer might be necessary. But this is as close to the coveted 10 as any game has gotten for me.

Rating confirmed after another play. We were teaching one new person this time, but he got up to speed quickly. After winter scoring round is a perfect time for a pizza break.

RATING: 8
A interesting early euro/war combo game where you have to mix building, taxing, and the threat of revolts to conquest.  Very good cube tower randomizer where if you get screwed one battle you are likely to make out in the next one.  Many online plays of this one at yucata.de

RATING: 7
Secret action planning and variable action order make this one a lot of fun to play. Feels 'short', but that makes each turn seem even more important. Some dislike the vagaries of the dicetower, but I find it adds a little spice to each battle (and it looks great!).
***UPDATE*** I've knocked this down to a 7 as although I like a lot of the mechanisms involved I've come to the realisation that direct conflict in multiplayer (3+) games doesn't always rub that well with me.

RATING: 7
Fabulous.  Simply fabulous.  I enjoyed this from the very first round.  In my initial playing I was soundly trounced, and I very much look forward to playing again!  This fits in well with both my fondness for games like El Grande and general interest for the 30 Years War historical context.

RATING: 8
Based on two games on SpielByWeb.com I like this game. One five player and one four. These have all been using the default setup and I get the feeling that starting positions are critical. The default setup(s) seem quite balanced. I could see how this could be disrupted by the advanced setup, and how you would start yourself could make or break the game for you.

Two of these games involved very little conflict. It seems appropriate to plan an attack carefully based on all the factors, but even then so many factors are randomized that it's still a gamble. Event cards, turn order, and forces lying in wait in the tower can really change your fate. I think I would mind this more if there were more battles, but it adds a great tension to the game that I like.

RATING: 8.5
A very interesting area influence game with many innovative ideas. In addition to area influence, one is also building infrastructure which can apply multipliers to the victory point calculation at the end of the game. Player turns are phased by a series of semi-random action cards that add a nice degree of suspense as you hope your plans will not be entirely upset by having things occur in an order you least expect.

Combat is truly unique, using the infamous "cube tower." Each of the combatants feed their troops (cubes) into the tower (which was also seeded at the beginning of the game). The interior baffles will trap some - and to find out the result, you count the numbers of cubes of each side that made it out and into the exit tray. More cubes of your colour means you win. It sounds nuts but the more you see it in action, the more elegant it becomes. Mass is generally rewarded but there can be surprises! Neutrals (peasants) can also appear to make things interesting and can turn the tide of battle.

The game was only available in German, with an English rules insert. The board and cards are in German but are simple enough that it barely detracts from the playability for English-only speakers.

The system was quite successfully carried forward in a Japanese themed version called "Shogun," (I refer to it as "Shogunstein" and it should not be confused with the older Milton Bradley Gamemaster series' Shogun) which included English versions. Both games are excellent and you should try to get hold of one or the other if at all possible.

RATING: 6
This is a good game, and a good way to play a wargame using Eurogame mechanics, but there's some bits I'm not so happy with:

Theme - doesn't fit with my understanding of the period - points for building stuff and it only gets burned down when both sides in the conflict 'lose'. Would make more sense (to me) if the board started populated with churches etc and they were pillaged as the game progressed.

Play Order - quite important, and determined randomly ...

Game Length - time to play is about right, but the game ends after 2 years (2 rounds) and it feels like that's too soon - would be better if it went a further year but I think the starting resources etc would need altering a bit to make that work.

Number of Players: 2 player variant isn't good and it's not that good with 3 either - even using the variant map.

Played this with three players.
Such a nice game. A lot to think about. If I conquer more land, can I still uphold the wheat for the winter or will there be a revolt. You have to think about your neighbours and protect your land from getting backstabbed.
Nice resource management game mixed together with area control and development.

Will probably get a higher rating after more games and with more players. Looks like it can be quite chaotic with 4+ players.

Sat on my shelf for 15 years before I finally got it to the table.  I have to say, it is more fun than I expected.  The cube tower is a great gimmick that adds the right amount of randomness to what would otherwise be a very dry majorities game.  Anyone who enjoys Risk but wishes there was more to that game should definitely check out Wallenstein.

Plays quite differently with 3, 4, and 5 players.  With 3 there is room to expand, so food production tends to be more important.  With 5, buildings are the primary means of scoring points, so there is less emphasis on food and more on creating buildings and taking (and retaking) territories with buildings and multiple building sites.  Fun either way, but I prefer 5 players because the conflict, and ensuing diplomacy, is more interesting.

This, for me, belongs to a class of games that are interesting to play for a handful of games but don't have staying power. You've got the programmed actions, the tension between building and attacking, the cool gimmick (the tower) ... all good stuff. But as a game, it feels more like a conglomeration of mechansims than a unified whole. It gets a bit repetitive, and the somewhat mechanical nature of the game somehow doesn't feel rewarding at the end. Compare to a game like Lowenherz, where by the end you really feel like you've been through something; Wallenstein seems to be missing that sense of beginning, middle, and end that gives you a feel of direction, of motion or accomplishment.

The 3 rating feels a little harsh, but that's where I'm at on the BGG scale - I would actively resist playing this again. In the lightly spruced-up Risk genre, there is better stuff out there.

Very clever game, if I could rate it on inventiveness then a Spinal Tap 11. Despite its Euro approach it has plenty of history hidden away. And lots of clever features. The Dice Tower is probably the most famous but I think the action board is much the cleverest. I was impressed how it could easily handle very different strategies in the same game.

RATING: 4
[21/04/05]

Theme: While I was by no means expecting a historical simulation, it has to be said that the game has precious little to do with the Thirty Years War. Indeed,  gameplay works against the theme. Rather than churches, palaces and trade posts being pillaged and burnt down in one of the most gruesome conflicts in history, players happily construct these buildings throughout Germany. Very odd indeed. Even thinly themed games such as Risk are more in keeping with their general themes.

Gameplay: Decision-making is largely done in the planning phase. Thereafter, those orders are then executed, which is little more than glorified bookkeeping as there are no decisions or uncertainty whatsoever involved save in the event of conflicts. In other words, you're only spending a small portion of play time making interesting decisions. What a bore. Collective downtime for all players, so to speak...

Further, turn order is determined in an entirely random fashion. Players ought to be able to influence this aspect of the game - say through bidding - considering how important turn order can be. What a waste of gameplay potential!

Similarly, I find that grain shortages can be truly trivial - at least if not reaching grave proportions. La Citta has a similar grain system, but makes far more effective use of it. 

The same must be said of the peasant revolts. Largely they're just a nuisance slowing down gameplay. A shame. This aspect could have been genuinely interesting. 

Wallenstein simply lacks the tactical and strategic depth found in Martin Wallace's masterpieces Princes of the Renaissance and Struggle of Empires, while it requires much the same (if not more!) time to play. Further, it does not manage to do its theme any justice, unlike those two way superior games. Player interaction is limited to conflicts, so for much of the time players are plodding along on their own. That simply does not make gameplay particularly lively.

Not enough strategy and theme. Too much luck involved (turn order) and bookkeeping. Considering what it has to offer, 2-3 hours simply is too long. 

The truly fun dice tower seems to have been the central focus of the game designer - at the expense of sufficient attention to making the rest of the game similarly fun and interesting.

No wonder this game is these days sold at bargain  prices here in Germany... Skip this one and play SoE or PotR instead.

This game has its luck, but like everyone, I think the dice tower is pretty cool.  Little long for my tastes.  I would like to think I won this because of something I did, but I don't really know because there was just so much going on.  Multiplayer tactical games aren't really my thing, because the one who stays out of battles is that one that wins the game....it's more fun than Age of Steam though.

The simultaneous action planning is deliciously tense, and the cube tower is just cool. If everyone is feeling frisky and mixing it up, the game plays much better. A little boring if everyone avoids conflict (even if it may be the best course of action).

Interesting game which makes you choose your battles very carefully. If you are used to Risk, you may find this game to be quite static. With the limited number of attacks available, you will not sweep the board. I like the cube tower which occasionally gives some surprising results. The box and card artwork is not the game's strong point. I prefer this to Shogun despite the art because it's a bit shorter and it's possible to leave some territories undefended because they aren't linked by some 'gamey' sea-route.

One game was enough to persuade me to purchase this gem.  A great mix of war and development with an engaging action card mechanic that produces bags of tension.  The game plays out 2 years of campaigning in 2-3 hours which some consider to be not enough.  My solution - play 3 years (or more if you have time)!  The tower is novel and hasn't annoyed me yet.  All in all, a great game I always look forward to playing.  Upgraded to second edition.

First play was exciting! We didn't get to play the whole game but it has incredible depth already and a fairly smooth and intuitive set of mechanics.

I thought the language barrier might be a problem as the cards are in German, but it was fine and there was only occasional need for translation that was nicely satisfied by resources here on the geek. 

I could end up really liking this game. (If I played it: language barrier is bigger problem than I thought at first because it stops it from hitting the table.) When's that English edition coming out?

Eagerly awaiting the U.S. release as Shogun!  What I like most about this game is the selection of actions before turn order, events, and other players' actions are revealed.  It makes for some interesting consideration of risk--is the King of Sweden going to take over that province before you can reinforce it with more armies?--and some speculation about where to expand one's territory.

I'd definitely get the German version (instead of waiting for Shogun) if it weren't so expensive!  (Edit: Hm, looks like MSRP on the new edition isn't going to be cheap either.  Ouch.)  It's not entirely language-independent, but really the only cards that require a lot of translating are the seasonal event cards, and not too many of those come up in the course of a game anyway.

And I need to refrain from making accidentally lewd-sounding comments regarding the tower in the future.

I don't think its entirely accurate to call this a "wargame".  Granted, you can play it with that type of strategy in mind (gobbling up land as much as possible).  But that's not really a viable strategy and will be ripped to shreds by experienced opponents.  Its important to remember that you are positioning for points....by controlling buildings and majorities of buildings in regions.  Battles should be surgical strikes...for specific reasons.  The action programming is a great mechanic as well.  I'm looking forward to playing this game more after the group gets familiar with the rules.

RATING: 5
Interesting hybrid between American and German games...the planning and move management is pure German, while the combat, and random elements are very American. Overall the game works very well, and the tower combat system is great, quick, and no more or less random than dice on average. I actually hesitate in calling this a war game in that combats are occasional, each player will participate in only a couple of major combats per game on average, the heart of it is actually in managing resources and timing moves. 

Still, this game has faded a lot with time for me...I can now see the critiques that there appears to be more going on in this game than there actually is. Player positions change very little over the course of the game, and the order of events in many cases isn't that important. I think the ultimate thing that hurts it though is the length to depth ratio. This is a solid 2 hour long game, but the decisions just aren't interesting enough to justify that length with any regularity to me.

Still charming, still willing to play every once in a while, but this ultimately has fallen to a 5 and I got rid of my copy because of it. If you want an actual conquest style war game paired with Euro mechanics I would suggest Wallace's Struggle of Empires over this.

I slept on this one when it came out for whatever reason, then it disappeared.  Now  it's been reprinted and I regret giving it a miss for so long!  This is clearly one of the best Eurogames money can buy, and I am just shy of calling it the absolute best German game I've ever played.  Better than Settlers (for the experienced player) and better than Puerto Rico.  By a hair.  Intriguing mechanisms and extremely tight decision making are combined with luck, strategy, and tactics resulting in the best wargame I think I've ever played.  All the "too lucky" crybabies be damned, the tower is a great combat resolution system that is also just pure fun and absolutely brutal.  Go play "Crocodile Pool Party" or something about balloon racing if you can't stand the heat.  This is easily Henn's best, and the best published by Queen.  Best, best, best.  I love it.

Not as good as as El Grande, Attila, Web of Power or Wongar. But still an awesome game of "area control". You must manage your troops, money, food and building construction. All while negotiating and manevering troops on the board. I wanted to add that the only drawback is that like most multiplayer wargames I find that people tend to move to the middle. If your stuck in the middle your dead. I don't know why people can't use some discipline and attack the leader rather than whoever is the closest.

Very good game with lots of player interaction, simple rules (core rules are just two pages), lots of fun. Several nice mechanisms, e.g. the programmed actions, dice tower. Some luck influence, so people can not be 100% sure about their final score untill the end.

Excellent Euro style wargame. The variable action sequence each season is great. There is lots of room for strategy and the tower is just the coolest! 

www.spielbyweb.com has a great version online that is very intuitive.

Played the Wallenstein version once, with 4 players. I expected to like this game, but I did not. 

First of all, there are too many factors to weigh. I don%u2019t want to work that hard at a game, unless there%u2019s a big payoff %u2013 and there wasn%u2019t, for me. It was frustratingly hard to accomplish anything. Attack a country and loose your whole army, build up your grain only to lose it all the next winter, buy buildings only to have your country stolen away, etc. And, themewise, it appears your whole economy is based on pillaging poor peasants %u2013 what%u2019s fun about that idea? The game seemed to drag on and on. (Perhaps unintentionally, it successfully conveyed to me the fruitlessness of the long 30 Years War.) 

I admit Wallenstein is an impressive piece of game design. I guess I just don%u2019t like long, involved area-majority games. Maybe if I just accept the game on it%u2019s own terms I%u2019ll like it more when I play again. But I%u2019m not sure I want to play again. [I was expecting this to be a combat game, like Risk on steriods. I played this game once when I was a euro newbie - my opinion might be different now. But I definitely like Shogun better.]

Since so many people spoke so highly of this game, I figured I couldn't go wrong with this title. Alarm bells should have been ringing in my head at the sound of the author's name, however. I usually don't like Dirk Henn's designs, and regrettably, Wallenstein was no exception. This game is craptastic. It pretends to be a masterpiece of historic strategy and even includes a booklet on the lives of the five player characters; what you get is a randomised piece of junk. It looks great thanks to the big map and, of course, the dice tower. It also has a pleasant playing rhythm which newcomers pick up easily. In that regard, the game is very streamlined and deserves significant credit.

But where it all breaks down is the utter pointlesness. It begins with establishing your 10 actions. Since you do not know when half of the actions will occur, it will have to be a wild guess at times. In addition, I cannot remember which action I assigned to what province to save my life. This becomes especially annoying when someone raids one of my provinces and I have to hand the card to him. Sometimes I even surprise myself by turning over a card I could not remember putting there, and worse, therefore have no idea what to do with it. Finally: what is the point of all that planning if the outcome of battle is more or less chaotic (in the mathematical sense of the word) anyway?  There is absolutely no need to think long and hard about what you're going to do, apart from selecting provinces rich in money or harvest. Chances are fairly large it won't go as you had in mind, anyway.

The conclusion is that Wallenstein is far from a strategic game: it revolves around simple chaotic combat and building for the moment. No brains required, just muck about, talk with pals, while trying to psychokinetically affect the outcome of a dice tower fight. I bet Wallenstein himself is doing 1000 RPM in his grave. I am really, REALLY glad this 'game' is no longer around to put the rest of my collection in a bad light.

Not bad--I'd definitely like to try it again.  My problems were that it seemed highly incremental--the game did not build, but rather seemed to involve repeating the same sorts of steps too many times.  Also, it seemed that while there were many important decisions to be made, you never have enough information at the time you have to make them.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Great game! Lots of tough decisions. Game is fun to play. If you don&#039;t like luck though, stay away, as the luck of the dice tower can determine the victor. I lost one close battle that resulted in me finishing in last place.  If I had won that battle, I would have won the game. One country with its buildings can sway the score that much.  Despite this (what could be seen as a flaw by some) the game is very entertaining and I enjoy it.

RATING: 7
Interesting RoboRallyesque war game.  Love the dice tower but system feels a little too inhibiting maneuver-wise and a very important factor in the game, turn order, is dealt with via a random draw.  It should be an auction or something.The online implementation is excellent and recommended and I've upped my rating of the game because of it!

RATING: 6
The idea is brilliant. Integrating area influence and warfare , still with a touch of euro-style resource manangement. Yet, I find it too time-consuming for the kind of fun it provided. But I have only played it three times, all with more than half the players newbies, so it does slow down the game considerably.

"It's a wargame!"
"No, it's a Euro!"

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Production: Lots of tiny cubes, revolt tokens, building tokens, and cards, all simple and functional.  The color coding of the regions is helpful in locating specific territories, though they can still be elusive at times.  Play: With all the different bits and tokens and cards, I'm surprised there wasn't chaos.  This game was less combat-oriented than I had feared, and even with five players there was plenty of room on the board, with several unclaimed territories at game's end.  I especially liked programming my turn based on what order the actions would be taken, and each of the different sorts of actions (building, harvesting, reinforcing, attacking) has a different flavor to it, so despite the brevity of the rounds, one feels one has accomplished quite a bit.  I was surprised at my enjoyment of this.  (2+0+3) (1 play)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
At its most fundamental level, it is a Risk clone.  Add to that the construction of buildings, indigenous farmers coming down on varying sides in combat, feeding your populace, secretly pre-planning actions for the turn, and a tower that makes combat as capricious as real-life can be, and you have an original.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
What's with the tower?

After you fight and lose because your mercenaries didn't show up, they'll be more likely to take the field for you next time... on the other side of the country! I know it's not meant to be a simulation, but the tower is just eye-candy for Eurogamers with an unreasoning hatred of proper randomisers. The more I play this (on SpielByWeb), the less I like it. The tower annoys me every time.

Wallenstein attempts to create what one might dare to call a perfect game.  A playable combination of Risk and Settlers of Catan with just the right amount of luck and skill to set it apart from the immitators and a very innovative combat system that seems to owe inspriation from a kiddies game.

The system of giving orders and the combat tower make Wallenstein just about the most innovative game in terms of game mechanics since 'German' games were first classified as such.  Everyone should give this a go, I've yet to meet anyone who didn't enjoy it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Only 6 actual turns per game makes this one a little too tight and unforgiving of mistakes. The game ends way too early and before any significant strategy can be pursued in any depth. Minimal prospects to pull down a runaway leader in time to change the balance of power. The resource model seems unnecessarily restrictive and arbitrary. For the most part Wallenstein overcomes these obvious problems for reasons I can't quite explain.

One of those games that I played and greatly disliked but feel I should play again since I must have missed something. The cube tower is dopey...it's a randomizing mechanism that leaves you with no way of predicting the outcome. Consequently, it seems to me, your best bet is to avoid using it at all costs. So I did. And won both games I played. Hmmmm. Add to that how almost everything is randomized in the game, and it simply feels as if it's iposssible to plan anything beyond the end of the turn.

Loses a point and a half or so for that damned tower.  So much variability, not only for just the attack you are taking care of now...but for future attacks that are yet to be impacted by armies that are stuck in the tower.  Impossibly random fighting.

Good game. I think someone else described this game as "a wargame for eurogamers" and that sums it up pretty well.  It has simple mechanics.  It's fun.  The tower is a kooky, interesting combat mechanism. More interesting than dice really. There are lots of tough decisions to make, though plenty of luck with the action order.

Not for hardcore grognards. Eurogamers looking for something a little heavier will enjoy it.

Wild and chaotic game. The winner must be a good surfer on the oceans of luck.
At heart, an influence-in-areas game, but the influence is of many forms (population & developments). The economic overlay of gold and wheat is simple and effective. The tower, of course, is funky. However, the turn preplanning with limited information is the beautiful heart of this game. Much agonising fun as plans are made, revised and remade.

Wally has it all.  Open like Shogun (Samurai Swords), orders like Diplomacy, empire building like Civ but something all-together new.  Exciting balance.  Where you levy you can't attack, or build, or tax.  Small empire easier to defend but gets fewer actions.  Leaving safe territories with few troops risks revolt.  Tower puts fun back in randomization.  My only concern is that cornered territories are the most strategically desirable but were not devalued in economics to offset.  This rating may go up.  People have been in search of Civ-lite?  It's right here!

After my first few plays I must say that I like this game. But I still have the feeling that the end of the game comes too fast.

[2006-05-04]
After a few more plays my rating goes up to 8. I really like the action-card-mechanism. You never know for sure what the other players will do. As a result, in each turn there are tough decision to be made: Will I add some armies to my "corn field" in order to scare that blue guy away or doesn´t he even consider attacking me and I´m wasting precious food? Do I attack the red player now or will I wait another turn, hoping that he won´t put additional armies in this region?

And the best about Wallenstein: It can be played competitive. :)

+ Nearly no downtime between turns since all players plan their turn simultaneously.
+ Tough decisions which lead to a lot of tension during the game.
+ The Dice-Tower: Normally I don´t like "dice-combat" but the Tower adds just the right amount of luck. There has never been a situation where I got mad because of a "Dice Tower-Result".
+ The winter-phase is a nice mechanic to ensure that no one is able to play too aggressively and conquer the whole map. You have to choose your battles wisely.

- I still think that the end of the game comes to fast. It just doesn`t feel right. But with all the fun I had in the six turns before it, I don`t bother too much anymore.

So many things are so great.  The five-up five-down action order.  The assigning territories to performing actions.  The fighting.  The scoring.  Having a battle come up before the gold phase, and snaking some guy's gold producer pick so he gets nothing.  The assigning of the countries to the actions is the coolest part though.  Really, just think about that.  10 actions, but each _place_ can only do one.  This would be a nine if I wasn't so much more excited about Shogun being in Japan.

8-6 Sorry, Germany.  But Shogun is so much better that I wouldn't think of picking this up again.  Not just in theme, but polish.

RATING: 4
I thought this one was overrated.  The tower was neat but most of the cubes fall straight through. But that's not what bothers me about it.  I don't agree w/those who say it is a cross between a wargame and euro.  It's pretty much an euro area-influence game.  There's no reason to attack in this game...except for the last attack card and that's only if you are last in turn order.  A game that suffers from the classic build-up and hope others engage in combat and weaken themselves.  So it becomes an average area-influence game.  El Grande fits that niche better and would be the better buy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Intriguing conflict game.  Players play warlords during the thiry years war, and are out to gain victory points by conquering countries and building majorities in buildings.  The core mechanic of playing your country cards against a set order of 10 event phases works really well.  Planning is crucial and there is so much information to juggle, you can probably count on one or two blunders over the course of the game.  Conflict is fiddly, via the wooden cube tower, but fun!  Probably a solid 90 minute game once everyone&#039;s played it once, count on two hours first time out.  Good stuff.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's a somewhat random Risk-ish wargame, but I love the "programming" mechanism of deciding at the beginning of the season what to do in each province.  Once side effect is that there is a limited amount of conflict in the game-- each player can attack at most twice in each season, and many of these attacks end up being against neutral provinces.  The tower is an interesting mechanism-- if you lose a battle that you should have won, you have a better chance of winning a later battle.  This actually made it feel less random than dice.  I don't know why there was no scoring track, though-- with all the other nice bits, it feels odd to also have to use a pencil & paper.

[Henn] A fresh multiplayer wargame, though admittedly not a fast-paced one. The innovative way it uses elegent Eurogame handing of familiar wargame features is the real pleasure of Wallenstein.

Cumbersome things like peasent revolts, harvesting and taxing are all made easy with elegent and effective systems. A rare winner for multiplayer wargames.

RATING: 7
The combination of randomly-ordered mechanics (Action order, Player Turn order, and Event order) in Wallenstein make it unique and a blast to play.  The goofy tower makes the battles a lot of fun as well.  A drawback in our early games: the game has a fairly serious turtling problem.  If you can get some territories off in a corner somewhere, you can easily defend them with a "battle fence" of outer countries while tossing up buildings as fast as you can in the territories that nobody can reach.  The winner of this game, whether intentionally or not, has used this strategy every time so far.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.75
A weird cross between euro and fighting: you get points by building buildings, and most points wins, but you also get points by holding territory, and you can punch the other players and take their stuff.  I like the programming aspect, but it can be pretty brutal.  If you tell a province to tax, and attack comes up before tax, another player can steal the spot before you get any money.  The game's only 6 turns long, so the loss of 1/6th of your income is a serious blow.  
Not sure whether I prefer this version or Shogun.  Think they're about the same.

I always enjoyed playing Wallenstein. I would probably say yes to play Wallenstein if anyone would make the suggustion.

I am not into wargames much. I don't really have an interest for them in general. Wallenstein is an exception to the rule. It is a perfect mix between a wargame and an euro which is rare to see.

In my last game, I had a strong start and a crappy finish. In the last turn I did nothing but fight with ONE player. It was a fight to the death, or in this case, a fight for 4th and 5th  place. Not something I would repeat anytime soon.

I played the new Shogun reprint of Wallenstion twice. I still prefer Wallenstein over Shogun. Battling on an island has it limits as protection is concerned. Although choosing your when you play and an extra card ability is a welcome addition.

Ok, the "dice tower" combat thingy is a bug, not a feature. Interesting game that tries a lot of randomizing elements to avoid it being completely deterministic. 

I would have to say I would give it one more try, but I'm less than impressed. For a game where you fundamentally only get 6 turns (3 each year + scoring each year), it takes a lot of time with a lot of fiddly bits for low fun density, etc.

RATING: 7
More area control goodness - the mechanic I love, but not quite done as well as El Grande.

However, there is a lot to like here.  I am an unabashed fan of the cube tower.  The thematic uncertainty involved is only part of the equation.  There is also something to be said for the creation of drama, just through the small amount of time taken to resolve the battle.  A battle system such as Antike's may be a more intellectual exercise, but it removes both the mystery and the drama.  The cube tower is even more fun than dice, because although it resolves battle more quickly, it creates a wondrous moment of clattering wood and a split-second to recognize just what exactly has happened - without the carpal-tunnel syndrome and repetitive pip counting of dice throwing.

The tower may be a bit anti-thematic, but it's hardly the most anti-thematic aspect of the game.  Complain about that, but have no problem with the rigidity of the action selection?

That rigidity is one mark down - the other is that the game lacks the transparency of El Grande, in terms of being able to clearly see how each decision has affected the outcome.  I won, but it felt more random and less satisfying than when I won at El Grande.

Euro-game styled war/economics game. Currently only available with German text components, but in 2006 Rio Grande will publish an English version of the game by Queen Games with a Japanese retheming (Shogun). 3-5 players, 3 hours, complexity 4/5.

RATING: 9.5
Last night five of us played one year (as a practice to get the general mechanics of the system. It was fun as hell and I was constantly shocked at how stupid and poorly thought out my "genius" plans turned out to be. I'm not sure what the best strategy for this game is, but it seems to be 'let others build and then take them over with your armies.' Revolts seemed like a hassle. And I wonder if the tower shouldn't be reseeded after the first year (since it was emptied of green by the middle of autumn.)

Actually, all the above is worthless commentary. All you need to know is "Dice Tower." Buy it for the dice tower, baby.

Another one of my "9"s.  Wallenstein is a great game of resource management, warfare and area control.  The mechanics of giving orders to each of the provinces coupled with the variability in with which these orders get executed is quite innovative as are the unrest and the revolts.  Finally, there is that cube tower, simply brilliant!

Equally well re-implemented by Shogun.

It is a very good game, but there is a tad too many things to keep track of for my liking. Too much forward thinking required. But, when you get started, and understand the turn order, it is very interesting. Timing, choosing where you build up, where you attack, makes key differences, but the revolting peasants make a nice balance. You need gold and grain, and if you strip your best lands, they will overthrow you. Wallemstein works as a game (El Grande style), and as a light sim. Wargamers will take to it well. Family gamers may struggle a lot. Mismanagement could see you eliminated.

played once but i really really liked it.  despite the fact that i don't understand why cubes falling on cubes sitting on a flat plane are supposed to displace them, rather than just bounce off and down.  i do agree with chris farrell's assessment that it's missing a good development arc.  or an arc of any sort.  i'm still very eager to play it again.

Excellent game loaded with agonizing choices.  Wonderful mechanics and game flow.  The tower idea is brilliant and works really well.  You only need to agonize over which actions happen before which, 6 times.  But the way the course of play evolves into opportunities and mayhem is superb.

Upate: knocked down a notch because the superior Shogun improves on this magnificent game.  I'ld rather play Shogun, unless we tried Wallenstein with Shogun rules...

RATING: 2
[Euro-wargame] [4P:2] So far only played on spielbyweb.com... and I already dislike the virtual dice tower. You combine the strange tower dynamics with random events and random+hidden action orders and you have a chaotic game. I think I can be convinced to play once in a while - most wargames are random anyway - by Wally's definitely not a game I'd be looking to own. ***UPDATE: Yep, the cube tower is definitely the worst thing about Wallenstein, and one of the worst resolution mechanisms I've ever seen in a game. If I were to rate this now, I'd give it a 3, maybe a 4, almost completely due to the cube tower. Replace the cube tower with a small amount of dice, or better yet, a deterministic combat resolution mechanism, and I'd like it much better. Let's see - dispense with the cube tower: when one player moves armies into another player's province, do a simple 1-for-1 elimination. Farmers die first. If it's a tie, the province is devastated as usual. That sounds much better. Have to try it with a physical copy. ***UPDATE: The cube tower? When you're unable to determine what your chances are of winning a battle, that's just unacceptable. It's one of the most broken mechanisms I've ever encountered. If you like your planning to have any sort of influence in the results of your combat, do NOT play Wallenstein or anything with this stupid cube tower in it. I was pining for the predictability of DICE for crying out loud. This game NEEDS a new combat system. I'd rather whack myself over the head with the cube tower before I play this thing again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An excellent game whose appeal definitely extends beyond the use of the tower (which is an excellent method of determining the outcome of combat - not quite random, and losing one battle increases the probability of winning the next).  Key to this game is the selection of actions; this can be crucial in affecting the outcome, especially later in the game.  Taking the actions in a different order each turn adds an excruciating element of doubt and risk.  Trying to achieve a victory solely through conquest is nigh on impossible.

Area control game based on Thirty Years War. The main feature of the game is its mythic tower of cubes. Conflict between players is usually not rewarding if used too often. Secret action placement phase is exciting but prone to A/P.

A good game with nice components and some interesting mechanics. Yet it doesn´t depict the thirty years war all too well. The random distribution of countries at the beginning of the game without any regards to the historical situation doesn´t help the theme at all. On the other hand this might prevent the game from feeling repetetive. The game also doesn´t involve the struggle between protestants and catholics making the approach to the theme even more superficial. It is still a fun game after all.

I had played Shogun first, and got this one in trade later.  Turns out its every bit as good as its reprint...just a different map.  Better?  Hard to say.  I dig this game, though.  Great blend of economics, balancing resources, building, and conquest.  You want to do far more than what you have actions for.

I might would say this should be played to a third year in game terms...we might try that someday.  Amazing game, all of my AT pals were skeptical at first but were converts by the end of the game.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
 An interesting game which teeters on being a euro-war game but doesn't quite succeed.  Wallenstein, and it's infamous block tower, is actually more interesting for it's pre programming of moves.  Players only know the first half of the actions sequence so have to bluff, second guess and strategize with a luck element to add chaos.  Although area control is essential to victory, land grabbing alone will just weaken one to be easily conquered.  Investing in areas and providing defense is key.

UPDATE:  Lowering to a four.  If at all interested why, read my comments on Shogun (ultimately the same game, except for turn order auction)

UPDATE: a three

Wallenstein is one of those truly great games: the perfect blend of simple rules and mechanics that fade into the background and enable you to focus on the strategic complexities and gut wrenching decisions that are the heart of the game.  The luck element is a self-balancing, manageable part of the whole.  A perfect blend of conquest, building, area control and resource management, easily playable in less then 3 hours.  Best of all: its fun!

RATING: 6
This game should be great, as its mechanisms are well thought out and there is a lot of brainburning to do when planning your actions. On the other hand, there are so many unknown random factors in the cards (and the tower), that all it boils down to in the end is sheer luck, which makes it hard to take it seriously. Fun gameplay, and of course the tower keeps you coming back for more.

I had a lot of fun playing this.  A good cross between war and development.  The cube tower was particularly entertaining ... giving a random element to battles while allowing for a bit more ability to predict the outcome than plain ole' dice.

Wallenstein! I love this game. Fantastic depth and tension, and wonderful decisions to be made every season. One thing I really love about this game is that all the major decision making happens at once, so all the analysis paralysis happens in parallel. While I'm stressing over my planning, so is everyone else. Then, the actual resolution of everyone's actions happens with little delay. There's essentially no downtime! Combine this with the absolutely amazing game mechanics and you have a massive hit with my group (despite the language issue) and a personal favorite.

RATING: 8
This is one darn good game if you like a little direct confrontation with your opponents. There are many decisions to be made and direct ways to inhibit your opponents plans.  Be aware...turn order, order of orders, and seasonal events are beyond your control.  But its all fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I know a lot of people complain about the randomness of the tower, but I love it.  It's unpredictable and gives out manned units a chance - things that presumably happen in real war.  

I also really admire the randomness of the action card order and player order.  

Plays best with 5.

Buying buildings in SAFE provinces if crucial.  There is no way to win without scoring points that way.  Having a lot of provinces is not nearly as important as having a few provinces in each region and having a few buildings too.  Even when behind, it's much like Age of Steam in that it can be fun just trying to stay alive!

This game is really almost perfect.  It's pretty long (3+ hours for a 5-player game, but at the same time, you have very few turns.  Somehow, it never gets boring despite the long game time.  Even if you're getting killed, it is a lot of fun to watch your opponents go after each other on the map.

RATING: 8.5
What a great game. This looks and sounds like a wargame but conflict actually plays quite a small part - players who throw themselves too readily into battle will almost certainly come off badly. The art is in balancing building, defense, taxes and resources. The tower is a great addition to the game and brings a fun twist to combat resolution. It is not a complex game because it is basically driven by your order cards. The turn-limited design keep the play time down to a reasonable level too. Recommended if yur players can get through the apparent complexity (it isn't) and the feeling that it's a wargame (it isn't).

Although many people think that Wallenstein/Shogun are war-games I strongly disagree with this opinion and I think it is the main reason for some low ratings. Wallenstein has some traces of a war game, but is not a wargame. It is a very good eurogame, dinamic and engrossing for five players that usually takes more than three hours to be finished but packs a lot of actions in it. I prefer Wallenstein´s map over Shogun´s one since it is more open and difficult to defend and thus more dinamic. ANother critic: scalability is subpar, play it with five people, no less, no more.

The thought process required to effectively program your ten actions every turn is deliciously excruciating.  Then there's the feared and mysterious cube tower that can make a mockery of all your careful planning.  Sound like a bad thing?  Not for me.  I love Wallenstein's volatile combination of carefulness and chaos.

I do wish that Wallenstein conveyed a greater sense of motion and maneuver on the board, and a lesser sense of entrenchment.  It takes a play or two to see that Wallenstein is not really a game of sweeping conquest.  It's a game of figuring out how to score victory points and then struggling to secure and protect and manage those assets.  In other words, a game in the classic German mold.  There are very few turns in the game, and each turn provides only very limited opportunities to manuever your forces and fight.  Whatever it is you're going to be doing in the game, you better start focusing on victory points from the very early stages or you'll run out of time.

Only plays well with the full table of five players.

Wallenstein is a hard game to nail down. It's a war game, kind of, except the Euro scoring system keeps things focused. It looks like the game is all about war, but war is so costly that you're better off picking your battles. There's also an element of resource management as your initial money won't take you very far, and taxing won't keep up with profligacy.

Yet included in this war/Euro/efficiency game is a large dose of LUCK. Players only know the order of five of the ten actions that come out, and it's entirely possible that another player will snap up your province before you get a chance to do anything with it. I can see how this is annoying to players used to chasing efficiency with all of their energy, but I find it a little refreshing. It involves a different kind of tactical thinking. It may not be advantageous to tax your richest province; rather, you want to tax your safest province to ensure it's still yours when tax time comes.

And then there's the cube tower, the arbiter of all disputes. Maybe your cubes get stuck in the tower in one battle you should have won, but they can shift the board in your favor later on. I love this balance. It really gives players pause before they go to war, especially if the farmers are fighting for you.

My rating has dropped considerably from first blush. Some clever mechanisms here, but I find I like the game a bit less each time I play. The game requires a great effort for middling results, and once you are behind, it seems very difficult to pull back into contention, meaning that second year can be a long, tedious affair for a tail-end player. Suggest a house rule where the last player to assign actions needs to lay his cards down at random. I'm afraid the game amounts to a series of precise inputs yielding random outcomes, which kind of gives you both the worst worlds of gaming.

Al principio tenia la idea de que el objetivo del juego era como en el Risk, masacrar al contrario, no es asi.
El objetivo es obtener puntuaciones en base a construcciones, siendo una muy buena tactica no atacar de principio sino acumular tropas para atacar en el momento oportuno al final de la ultima estacion de cada año.
El oro es fundamental, el trigo muy importante para no tener revueltas.
Me gusto mucho el juego.
El sistema de combate es muy bueno ya que equilibra el juego y da un poco de incerteza.

My initial impression is that it's a combination of a wargame and a Euro, and not a bad attempt, but also maybe not quite enough of either of those types to be really satisfying. It's a "whole less than the sum of the parts" kind of thing. But I've only played it twice so far, and I appreciated it more in the second game, so the odds are that I may grow to enjoy this quite a bit, though at the moment it's only a 7 for me.

(Rating after 3 plays).  Very enjoyable game system that seems very balanced.  I like  the mixture of control and random elements.  In often feels like it should go one more round, but the game would probably take too long if that were the case.

RATING: 7
Essentially a game of protecting and developing ones territory while sacking those of your opponents. 

There are several innovative mechanics in the card management and combat resolution. The whole effect creates a nice sense of paranoia, the feeling that there is never enough armies, money or actions to keep you safe. 

No down time, lots of activity and difficult choices make this a fun game.   My only complaints are it's perhaps a little too chaotic, could be more conflict and it feels like it ends too soon.

RATING: 7
Good game, near order selection mechanic.  Expect some down time during your first game or two, as players get acquainted with the limited choices they have!  The wargame aspect is very minor, and the tower of death makes combat resolution instantaneous.  Unfortunately, I'd prefer dice, as the tower can prove problematic if someone bangs the table (accidentally or not)

I enjoy this game. It plays quickly, almost too quickly for a war that lasts 30 years ;), but it was a challenge to keep up in the game. I enjoy the confrontation and the effect of the peasants in the over exploitation of an area for it's resources and in the cube tower. The simultaneous revealing of your actions really is great at keeping things moving in a type of game that could really drag with some players.

A lot of subtlety in this 'Waro' from Dirk Henn- much of it probably not visible on a 1st solo play, but the many levels of choice, the way the game and the setup fight against you, the interactive combat and struggling, combined with the cool cube tower- it's just a lot of fun to play, whether or not you get all of what's going on.

I'm sure that with play this could go up further; uncertain how often it will come out without an established group, but I'm sure I will pull it out from time to time because it's a truly enjoyable game.

RATING: 5
The good Food places are few and concentrated and seem to dominate strategy a little (as everywhere else is of approximately the same value). Only played with 3 and I suspect this is a little better with more. As we found that two players squabbled and the third player won....

OK with a few more plays including a four player game this one is beginning to look not so good. Seems fairly luck dependent. Also it is easy for one person to be hit by all other players and have his position destroyed without being able respond (he is then weak and his retaliation is split between multiple attackers....). Plus kingmaker issues. Not better with four than three. If anything worse!

The dice tower is cool, but there's many more mechanics worthy of praise in this game. For example, the whole actions system is very well done.

The only things I found unnecessary were the events. They don't have enough impact and it's another fiddly component in an already fiddly game. I think the way wheat reduction is determined is very clever though.

RATING: 8
Think of this as a Euro-ized version of Risk and you'll have the right sort of picture. Essentially an abstract conflict game with majority scoring (ignore the Thirty Years' War, there's nothing here that ties mechanism to theme). The limited opportunities to attack obviate much of the 'who gets picked on' effect inherent in multi-player wargames, but both action order and peasant revolts aren't as big an influence on the game as perhaps they should be. With province scoring tight, winning comes down to building majorities, but as a game with a substantial chaos element winning isn't entirely in your own hands. At 2.5 hours this is one of the longer Euros, but still  popular with everyone I've played it with. Awful rule book.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A cross between Risk and El Grande that's better than either.
Feels a bit static, as there is little movement, so it is difficult to drag down an early leader. Usually this sort of game is too political, but this one is the opposite.

It's about time to let go this beautiful game. Original German edition from Queen games in good condition, but this copy is not for a purist collector due to following two conditions.

- two yellow cubes are missing (60 out of 62)
- Protective clear tape was applied to the edges of the box
- All cards were laminated with very high quality thick laminate film. They are as thick as Credit card
 
Other components are complete and in like new condition.

I'd say that this one needs more plays. The tower is certainly fun, but also bit gimmicky. Have heard good reviews of the two player variant. Hah, just noticed that we've ignored the revolt markers totally.. Doesn't seem to work that well with only three. And I finally sold the game.

RATING: 7
First played June 19th, 2008. Taught in 20min, played in about 2.5 hours with 5 players. The game has good luck/strategy balance. It runs a bit long, however it worth it for those who have time to play. It keeps your interest throughout. I'd recommend giving it a gameplay and consideration in playing every now and then. Each person starts out with 6 gold and 6 blank cards(for hand). Next each player takes 9 cube/armies and they are all mixed and tossed into the battle tower. The ones that come out are returned to each player, the ones that are stuck in the tower can come out for other players during battle. Two province cards are placed face up and the start player picks one of the two(or hidden top most card). Once picked they place initial placement of one of their army sets(5,4,4,3,3,2,2) on them and add the card to their hand. Next another card will replace the card taken. Each player will draft 7 proviences and use all of these army sets; this will conclude pre-game setup. Next there will be two years played of 4 seasons/rounds each. In each round, each player has up to 10 actions they can take. Actions are shuffled and placed at the bottom of the main board with the first 5 visible and as actions are taken, the next one becomes visible. Each person secretly takes their hand(blank/province) and places them onto action spaces on their personal player board. The blanks represent passing of that action. You may place a Palace for 3 gold(on that province), Church for 2 gold, Trading house for 1 gold, harvest grain at the cost of one revolt marker, tax for gold at the cost of one revolt marker(two causes a revolt much like a battle with farmers), place 5 armies in the specified province, place 3 armies in the specified province, place 1 army and move armies into an adjacently controlled province, and two attacks from a specified province. After all have locked in their actions, the first action is turned over and executed by all players in the player order(randomlly drawn and displayed). During battles, you may lose a province and must give it back to the general pool(if a tie; or to the board if uncontrolled). If you battle another player each take their armies and place in the battle tower. Matching armies that come out are returned to each player. If there are extra of either side, that player wins. Any other armies are left to be mixed with the next battle armies(constantly reloaded). If you attack an uncontrolled province, you battle one farmer army. At the conclusion of each year you must have enough grain to feed each provience otherwise there will be a revolt. VPs are awarded 1 for each province and 1 for each building built. For each of the 5 regions each player gets 3 VPs for the most Palace, 2 for the most Churchs, 1 for the most Trading Frims. If there is a tie, each tied player recieves one less for that tied building. Winner is the one with the most VPs.

The main criticism of Wallenstein seems to be that there's a lack of control, but IMO the heart this game is the fun/challenge of managing all the different things that are going on -- attack and defense, maximizing your odds in the dice tower, gold and grain collection, majorities of buildings, the event cards, and revolts. Quite a gaming experience. Plus the dice tower is just so cool.

RATING: 8
Wallenstein in a very interesting but ultimately unsatisfying game. The components are the first aspect of the game to pique the interest (obviously here I'm referring to the tower). Then when you read the rules you discover a lot of interesting mechanics. After playing a couple of games you may find that Wallenstein is full (relative to other Euro games) of tactical possibilities and the potential for surprise. There is a nice element of tension during the action planning phase. However, there are perhaps too many unknown elements in Wallenstein. And your most carefully-hatched plans can be spoilt if another player makes a certain arbitrary (or vengeful) decision. Following my latest play (which I perhaps undeservedly won), I'm beginning to think that Wallenstein is a somewhat unbalanced mixture of Euro game and multi-player wargame.

This is basically 'Shogun' (its predecessor, in fact).  Not sure which setting I like better, but the map is clearly superior here.  The plays of 'Wallenstein' are much more dynamic and interesting because of it (no turtling). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A very fun game if you can stand the randomness and unpredictability, this game has it in spades, maybe more than any other I know which unfortunately leads to some frustration. 

Still a good amount of strategy and tactics to be had here (just don't count on your plans working out), choosing your actions is really prone to AP, there is a ton to think about, especially as things progress and you are required to 'outguess' or try to anticipate your opponents moves as well. The tower is quite cool and innovative for solving conflicts and not near as random as some other things in the game, the main one being the order of the actions (the first 5 randomly set out and the last 5 random and blind!), this order of actions can really "make or break" your plans and the plans of others and gives you very limited control over what you and others are doing. 

Conflicts are very hard to carry out as the game is so restrictive in your actions, one province can only do one thing per turn and this makes it much more difficult and requires serious planning ahead and even then it may not be desirable anymore by the time you are ready for it. Good game despite these things but it does run somewhat long, especially with 5 players. Reminds me more of a restricted and random Risk with some nice added elements than anything else, only a little like Grande in the choosing of actions and scoring but this isn't so much area influence as it is resource management and war.

Update: 8 => 7 A second playing of this through the new 'Shogun' version (very little difference in core system) drops the rating and even the wife didn't like it this time and she loved it the first time (after she has played many more games she now realizes the negative effects of randomness). By the BGG rating system this would rate somewhere between a 2 and a 3 because I really don't ever want to play again, I think I would rather play Risk (and that is not saying much) as even it has more control, dice or no dice. It is a well designed game albeit it is full of randomness and therefore fine for some people just not for me. Everything about the game is randomly determined; Turn order, event cards, action sequence & combat resolution with the tower. One hour or less games with random/luck elements can be tolerated but this is a 3 hour game. My rating is for what I think this deserves as a 'game' and not for my desire to play. I might be a little too generous here though and I do think this is over-rated on the Geek IMHO.

Very good game despite the tower's luck factor. I like the preplanning of moves, it takes some serious premeditated thinking.

Wow!  The wargame that wasn't.  Deeper than most Eurogames, but still very playable in 2-3 hours, even with newbies.

Update:  After two plays, it moves up in rating.  The need to plan with limited information, coupled with the tight resources/actions/victory conditions make this a classic.  The random nature of the tower serves to limit expansion and keep this from being a "risk-esque" style wargame.

Update #2:  While I like the turn-order mechanic in Shogun, and the somewhat harsher grain/rice conditions, I think overall I prefer the Wallenstein map.  They are enough alike that I consider them the same game for recommendation purposes.  After playing 5 more of these in the last two months, I want to play more!  Thus, this is now a 9.  Can 10 be coming in the future?

This is a great WARGAME in the German-type game style. It produces the strategy of hex and counter games without the book of rules.

A meaty game, so many interesting interactions between random player order, semi-hidden random action order, and known-but-random-ordered events, on top of all the resource management and area control.  I think this is going in my top 10!

Exciting amount of chaos, but not enough to overwhelm careful strategy.  Cube tower nicely simulates fog of war.  I love the feeling it gives me of being a field general: laying out my strategic plans at the beginning of each turn, then having to adjust tactically to developments on the "ground" (other players and/or the revealed action order).

Strategy notes for next time: "chipping away" from other side is working well.  When drafting, don't just focus on my locations.  Try to "block" someone if they are consolidating a lot of area.  I might have won the last game if I hadn't let the Kurfpalz player monopolize it during draft.

RATING: 6
Wallenstein is currently out of print, but many gamers are familiar with Shogun, essentially the same game on a different map with very small tweaks to the rules*. For that reason, I will refer to both games here. 

Often referred to as a "Weuro" (wargame/euro), Wallenstein blends resource-gathering and construction with army-raising and battles. Attacking plays a small role (12/60 actions with four possible targets). Opportunity cost is quite high, and attacking simply for the satisfaction of seeing your armies collide is a good way to lose. It's primarily a game of developing and guarding territory, and attacks must be made with precision against players in the lead. Wallenstein and Shogun are not games of conquest. Not by a long shot. 

Unfortunately, the game's standout mechanic is the one used to resolve combat, which in my mind comes close to making the whole affair a bait-and-switch. When two armies collide, each side's forces (cubes) are dropped into a tower. Some of these cubes will get caught on various cardboard ledges inside the tower, so sometimes numerically superior forces will suffer defeat (pretty standard characteristic of combat resolution in games). The twist is that cubes caught in the tower will later be dislodged in other skirmishes. This has two implications. First, players known to have more cubes in the tower are more dangerous to attack. Second, players whose cubes are dislodged in combats in which they are not a participant now have those cubes as an explicit bonus to their next combat. Admittedly this is all pretty cool, but it's such a small part of the game that it can't really redeem the rest of it. 

Each turn, players begin by executing simultaneous action selection [i]in batches of ten[/i]: build x3 (distinct), attack x2, gather resources x2, raise armies x3 (distinct). The order of resolution is random, and only the first half is known to players as they program actions face-down. Often it feels like "a lot of sound and fury, signifying nothing." Sooooo many steps. Sooooo much planning. Soooo much resolution. [i]And almost nothing happens.[/i] Obviously enough happens to determine a winner and I'll grant that it rewards good decision-making, but I find the experience draining, and way out of whack with any sense of payoff I derive from it.

I look at Wallenstein with a mix of admiration and incredulity. A lot goes in, but not much comes out.

[size=6]*One of the stranger "prevailing wisdoms" I've seen on BGG is that Shogun improves on Wallenstein's mechanics. It doesn't. Shogun takes an extremely procedural game and gives it a bad map, token special powers, and an auction that perpetuates leaders (essentially amplifying the effect of a poor map). Every difference between the two games shakes out in Wallenstein's favor. [/size]

Best euro-wargame, hands down.  Resource management and combat.  Isn't that what life is all about?  The battletower gives one pause, true, but you learn to love it.  I'd love to see a US publisher pick this one up and redo the theme.

This game works better FTF than online at www.spielbyweb.com . You just need to see your opponents for this to play the kingmaker game. 

The game can get a bit repetitive with 6x10 actions being performed.

It's still an 8/10 because of the great simultaneous action planning and tension of play.

After one play on SBW, I'm partially surprised because it wasn't at all what I was expecting.  A very gamey area-control game with heavily abstracted conflict.  Made me appreciate Tikal more.

Lovely game, great player interaction, and that crazy tower kinda grows on you.  I knocked it half a point because I'd like a touch more history in the mix, but that's just me being niggly.  Nice mix of decision making, diplomacy, and uncertainty - always a satisfying gaming experience.

RATING: 8
This game is surprisingly good with two players - there's an incredible amount of uncertainty and room for some very interesting decisions.  It is substantially more chaotic with 4 or 5, but that does not detract from the enjoyment of the game.  I like the cube tower mechanism, the randomness doesn't bother me at all.  I know next to nothing about wargames or even games like Risk or Axis & Allies, probably a liability in a game like this, but this is still a lot of fun. 

Update: played much more, still enjoy, but has been supplanted by Shogun.

Further update - I don't really like the Shogun map, so I would prefer to play Wallenstein.

RATING: 8.5
Very good game.  Played it twice now at least maybe three times.  Very tempted to get this or Shogun.

I'll say our group uses a timer for deciding actions and I actually like that quite a bit.  I hadn't realized till the last game that this was just merely suggested by the rules if turns are taking too long.  Of course, I might like it just because I'm horrible at spotting the values of each and every possible move, but I can get a good feel for a reasonable strategy.

Superb. Territorial conquest combined with the need to manage gold, grain and investments in buildings. We love the simultaneous game turns, the ingenious cube tower battle-determiner, the subtle choices and the player interaction (even some Diplomacy-style negotiation and bluff). Finally the revolting peasants help give the game a real feeling for the period. A genuine all-time contender.

Al igual que su sucesor Shogun, me parce un juego largo y aburrido, una vez piensas qué acciones haces, el resto es básicamente esperar a ver qué han hecho los demás. Y eso suponiendo que tengas más de 6 o 7 provincias, porque si no las opciones son limitadas y casi directas.

There are connections to Risk, El Grande and A Game of Thrones. The tower is a definite plus. Very nice and my fear that this would be going to take way too long when our group learns more and the analyzing really starts hasn't materialized. There's slightly too much randomness, especially in battles this can be too Risk-y. The game isn't too heavy because you don't have as much control as it at first looks like and the game is a bit on the longer side.

RATING: 9
A lot of great concepts woven together seemlessly to make a game with lots of brutal decisions.  The dice tower is a great mechanism, it adds uncertainty, but &quot;lucky&quot; events will even out over the game without having to rely on statistics.  The combat system is such that there are many checks against all-out militarism.  The main innovation is the action phase, in which you can only take one action in each province.  You can&#039;t build in a province and then fortify it in the same turn, for example.  This forces lots of challenging decisions.  Plays pretty quickly for the amount of depth.  Great game!

Hmmm.... Contrary to a lot of the comments on BGG - I felt the game is bland. It takes roughly 2 hours. You get 6 real turns with which you get 2 attacks max. With a random startup you get some cohesion, but not a ton. You spend your time building up, attacking relative close and good regions. Everyone does this so it can equalize so you end up in a roughly same position. Seems very boring to me - A complete waste of time. As a side note I do love the tower though.

The core of this game is one of my all-time favorites, but I would always prefer to play with the bid-for-turn-order cards and a few of the other rule changes in Shogun and 2nd ed. The visuals on the 1st ed. map are also quite washed out compared to the update. Decisions affect results in this game, but there's still plenty of chaos and luck.

I love the cube tower.   It's a random element that cannot be analyzed in any meaningful manner -- it's brilliant.

Unfortunately, the rest of the game is pretty awful.  It's completely chaotic.  You think you have decisions to make, but you have to outguess your opponents, the order of the phase cards, and the cube tower.  You may as well lay your cards out randomly.  

The most disappointing thing about this game is the theme.  Don't believe anyone who says this is a eurogame crossed with a wargame.  There is no element of historical simulation whatsover.  You could retheme this to any randomly chosen time and place -- say feudal Japan -- and not lose a thing.

It's a lot like risk.  Only more fiddly and longer, but taking less skill and having less theme.

Area control and resource management game dipped in a wargaming sauce. Building up the defense of your countries and building palaces, churches and trading posts is more important than attacking other countries. If you fall behind in the number of countries you control, then it will be very difficult to catch up. The cube-tower is an original way to determine conflicts. There is still a random element, but a player with  a lot of surplus cubes has a high probability to win the battle. ***** The more I play this game, the less I like it ... too much randomness (player order, event cards, action sequence, combat resolution) and impossible to reach most parts of the board which limits the possibilities for attack (it takes a year to build up strength, move one province and build up again - the game only lasts two years) ... frustrating experience. ***** Sold my copy 08/09/2006 - the first game to leave my collection!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This game has a nice theme, the map is beautiful, and the cube tower is an attractive component that works well.  However, the game is too abstract and random, particularly if played with a variable setup, to be worth the time it takes.  Poor luck in the opening selection of provinces will scatter a side's forces and make it nearly impossible to win.  I would advise caution if you are thinking of buying this as a supposed gateway to wargames.  It's too random and chaotic -- even for a Euro.

Granted I enjoy the game, but it still feels like a problem in the design.

Come on guys, its got that little tower from El Grande in it!  It automatically gets 5 points just for that.  The game play reminds me a bit of risk, but in German game style form.  Its an excellent game, up there with the best in the game industry.  I did rate it a 9 for a couple of reasons.  The fact that I have no idea where any of the old skool regions in Germany are (on the map) makes it a bit confusing for setup/gameplay.  Do Germans even know all these areas off the top of their heads?!?    2nd, I've never been a huge Risk player, which this game reminds me of.  Albeit this game kicks Risk's butt anyday of the week.  Highly recommended for a hardcore German style game!

RATING: 8
Really enjoyed the cube tower resolution of battles/revolts.  Money proved tight by the end and the food shortage killed me, particularly after an opponent took over my best food producing territory in a battle before the production phase occurred.  Seeking to find the balance between producing food, money, armies, attacking, and building special buildings in the midst of uncertainty as to player order, event card, and not knowing the order of the last 5 actions can be paralyzing or overwhelming if you need to think through all the possibilities.

I enjoy this game immensely. Wallenstein demonstrates a simplicity of rules, but depth of play, that I find most enjoyable. Not too much negotiation, some bullying, some luck, and engrossing decisions throughout. 2.5 hours for my group but seemed much faster. A lucky opening set-up may weigh too heavily. Still very eager for the next session!

I absolutely loved this clever and unique Euro-wargame hybrid.  I think it of it as "El Grande with the opportunity for combat."

Wallenstein on the move.  The great Imperial leader for Catholics cause.  He was recalled by the King because he performed too well defeating the enemy.  He was asked to lead the army again when his King fell back from the field.  He was finally assasinated by his own men.  A tragic military and political leader.  This is a good example of combinaton of military wargame (in its loose sense) with Euro-family style rules and game mechanics.  The game although lacks the "true" historicity but  overall the game conveys what issues the fighting generals are facing at that time: balancing the countries economy with the military expansion.  To extend too far, your supplies may not support you.  To tax and confiscate crops more, the peasant may revolt against your rule.  To plan the manouver and combat, you may be foiled by the "hand" of God (because the action sequence is different each turn season).  It is not a bad game.  But it also lacks the "chromes" that the wargamers are generally looking for. It is, nonetheless, better than some of the acclaimed "beer-and-pretzels" or folio sized wargames (e.g. SPI/TSR's Blue and Gray).  The dice tower used to resolve battles is especially something innovative (well, at least to me).  It is however abstract and casting doubt somewhat to the number of troops inside the tower remaining (because you are not sure whether there is certain "dead spots" inside the tower where the "troop" would never come out).

GREAT GAME! - Period. This Euro has some very nice mechanisms that add up into a very balanced and integrated whole. 

I was a bit skeptical about the whole cube tower device, which I thought gimmicky. But it works, and works very well! - I could see the use of cube towers in other applications as well (the mind boggles).
 
Wallenstein keeps you busy planning, hoping for the best and expecting the worst, and at times your main opponent isn't the other players, but general Winter, the environment of the season and those pesky peasants, who will revolt at pretty much anything.

Played only on spielbyweb, which in this case may help to illuminate the truth about the game, since it strips away the toy factor of the cube tower.

Like Web of Power, Wally is a game that suffers from the nasty combination of being static AND highly random at the same time.  While the tower had an advantage over dice-based resolution of promising future compensation for a horrendously unfair result, it is still tremendously lucky, and can do a lot to undercut sound strategy.  Additionally, if you pick a province to gain gold or grain from, and lose it before you get the harvest, you are going to be seriously wounded, if not put out of the running.

On the static side, because players can make a maximum of two attacks per turn, and the tower more or less forces you to only attempt attacks where you have a strong advantage (not to mention the issue of not making an attack that will leave an exposed flank behind), not a lot of real action occurs.

Overall, I have to say that this one is rather blah.  I'm even tempted to used the 'O' word here.

UPDATE: Been thinking about the game some more, and I've knocked off another point.  When you consider the elegant and strategic systems available in modern wargames, Wally's flaws are just so glaring.  Some of the simpler, introductory, wargames like Crusader Rex or Napoleon can be played in the same time (or shorter), and, by reputation and appearances, offer a much richer experience, with similar or less rules density.  About the only thing Wally really has going for it is the multi-player thing.

Bad.

One of the best games I have played.  There are many interesting decisions to be made through the course of the game.  The chaos of the programmed actions requires a good amount of risk management as well as planning.  Players can take bad risks and be punished severely for them, which only serves to increase the game's tension.  There is also a nice story-arc to the game.  It begins innocently enough, but by the middle of the second round, players will need to be careful about their neighbors' intentions.  Most notably, there is a high "fun-factor" with this game, and new players are almost immediately drawn to it.  Plus, the cube tower is an interesting and novel approach to resolving battles.

Gret game! Theme is well rendered. I really like the simultaneous action. It allows some interesing combo when you attack an opponent.

Good game mix: area controlling, resource management and wargame with good 30-years-war theme. Remarkable: Cube tower! Usually takes 2 to 3 hours to play. Great game but German rulebook could be better. Internet FAQs will help.

Tense, strategic game, with some luck and many decisions to take. War is only a part of the game, that's based on planning (with only "imperfect" information). Best with 5 players.

***Update: the more I play, the more I dislike the combat system (the tower is a cool toy but still only a randomizer... and quite unpredictable as well!). Having only a few battles per game exacerbates the impact of luck.***

This has all the features I want from a good strategic/conquest/diplomacy/economic game: great wooden bits, huge board, short playing time, good rules. If you're looking for a game of this kind, this is one to get.

RATING: 5
The cube tower is a interesting idea. It is very random and makes planning for battles in this game hard to do. I like that fact, however it tends to drive this game away from being a war game and more into a building game. To me this game just lacks real shine after you get over the novelties (cube tower, hidden actions). I find it dull to play. Not a ton of player inter-action and in the end it comes down to a few key battles and the luck of the tower. Maybe a longer game with more chances to score would even this out. But, with just 2 turns (something that feels too short to me) it  really doesn't work.

Only solo'ed this one so far but started an online game to find out the nuances and learn the rules better and have a group that is interested in trying it face-to-face. PLayed 3 games online. Great fun and enough surprises to make me want to come back for more esp. with the advanced setup. 

Got this one to the real table at last; It is as good as I had hoped, pre-planning was quicker than I feared and the combat system had a few lovely surprises, I think our group will be investing in Shogun now.

The cube tower is one of the more entertaining design mechanisms I have seen and is not as random as some think - lost cubes early in the game merely come back later barring bizarre luck, making it somewhat self balancing. The rules tweaks ported over from SHOGUN are worth implementing if you have the older edition.

The first game I played that really delivered on elegant rules, exciting and subjective gameplay and historical interest without sacrificing much at all. It's a really tense game, deriving it's tension both from the threat of other players and the limited choices and resources at your disposal. And it has a dice tower. The worst thing about it is that although this is in no way a "multiplayer solitaire" game, too much time is spent individually placing your action cards for the turn to come when you could be actively interacting over the board.

This is a nice solid German pseudo-wargame.  Our group has taken it on as 'Game of the Month'.  Despite playing several weeks in a row, a five player game still takes us just under 3 hours to complete.  This is too long for what the game offers.  It is nice, but just shy of greatness.

Hmmm, not so sure on this one, I want to say that the battle tower is cool, however that might be the only cool thing about this game.

Only played it once so far with 5 players. For new players I'd really recommend the player aid on this site as it really makes the rules explanation a lot faster - important when the game takes a few hours itself.  Enjoyed the game (particularly as I actually won for a change) but I would be concerned that it is easy for people to fall behind and not catch up.  More plays would help form my opinion on that aspect of it.

Fantastic war game. Choosing your actions in secret before each "season" means you have to anticipate your opponents' actions. Not having perfect information about the order those actions will be played out each turn is also a great twist. The unique "battle tower" method of determining combat outcomes seems more fair than dice over the course of the game. Resource management is important but not overly complicated and the peasant uprisings are a great touch.

Wallenstein is THE game. It has everything I look for in a game. A little bit of war, a lot of strategy and tactics and a wee bit of luck. The only downside of the game is the problem finding players for it.
The tower is something I don't realy care for. It doesn't bring a great deal into the game except that there might come some reinforcements in a next fight.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Yes, this is a good game with good tension and high fun factor. I like this map better than Shogun's. In Wallenstein each area has more borders, more options to attack, easier to move around. Shogun has the added bidding for turn order and advantages. I play both.

Only decent simulation of the 30 Years war I have come across. Before the purists scream, it is the only one I've come across which recreates the anarchy of the campaigning (armies invading allies just to eat, or simply disappearing and reappearing, or sitting static to their own side's despair). I rest my case.

Solid combination of warfare and Euro-like mechanics. Pros: - low downtime (something rare for a multiplayer wargame), lightning-fast combat (and that dice tower is just AWESOME!), lost of angstm and anguis
Cons: - The game is too short! There is a fair amount of randomness in all of the submecanics (dice tower, turn order, action order, events), and there is only two scoring rounds in the game... I wished that there were 3 or 4 rounds, to even randomness up a bit over the term of the game. Unlike most other "modern" wargames, this one doesn't have rules/mechanisms to prevent massive pitched battles on the last round as every rushes to grab that one last piece of land before time runs out. This felt a little anti-climatic and unrealistic, and placed disproportinately more importance on those last few battles.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A tough war game that features simultaneous action selection.  One does't know in which order actions 6-10 are going to occur in or which event (of 4 each year) is going to occur.  Scoring only happens twice so it's a contest of efficiency and knowing when to screw over your opponents (if you do it too soon you may have a full blown vendetta against you and since it's a quick game you'll probably lose to the others that aren't involved).  The dice tower is great in that you know how many cubes will be thrown into the tower but you don't know who's cubes will come out of it (you cannot count on "odds").  The tower is seeded early on in the game with cubes from each player and the neutral farmers.  Wars are vicious and ties (when an equal amount of cubes roll out of the tower) result in the whole area being destroyed.

Better played online (www.spielbyweb.com) than on board, because the server takes care of boring tasks ;-).
Despite his appearance, it's a management game, not a wargame: to win you have to watch at your resources and use them carefully; conquer of provinces can give you more troubles than advantages.
It has a big flaw (and my report reflects that): the game order of last roung give a huge advantage to last player

RATING: 8
Played once (mostly).  This is an area-control game where players vie for control over regions (by battling with armies), yet victory is determined by the number of buildings constructed in each region.  The turns are brain-burning, as there are eight different actions which players must "program" ahead of time to occur in one of their provinces.  Just enough is known before the turn begins to get an idea of what you want to do, but the unknown elements make each turn extremely dynamic and fun.  Planning for the unexpected is a must, and tactics reign supreme.  I love it.

This rating might go up or down with repeat plays.  I really like the action mechanic, where each action can only be performed once, and each region can only perform one action.  I also like the way the actions occur in random order.  I don't like the initial board setup.  A bit of bad luck can make the game unwinnable for one person (and vice versa).  It could be, however, that I just don't understand the nuance of how to initially set up the game.  Time (and repeat plays) will tell.

Gladly sold my copy of this chaotic mess. On first glance Wallenstein looks like a grand, multiplayer wargame with a unique combat mechanism and interesting action selection mechanics. After a few plays it starts to becomes obvious that all the second guessing required in the action selection phase goes into a trash can because the cube tower and the action resolution grind against each other to make a confusing mess. I actually love the cube tower but it doesn't work with the other mechanics at all. I'm convinced that everyone who loves this game are only awe struck by the uniqueness of the cube tower. A shame it hasn't been adapted to other games that could make better use of it.

Great game.  Very deep, yet very simple in rules.

The resistance of the people as the leaders squeeze them for food and gold.  Plus the dicetower is very novel (to me anyway) , and very fun to use.

I haven't played this enough to tire of it yet so for me it rates as a solid 9. An excellent combination of diverse mechanisms. War/economics/territory acquisition all play a part and this is one of the few games that when the game is over you think... if only it were a little longer. The mechanisms fit so nicely together that you feel that the game should go another year at least... which has to be a good thing for replayability. 

Update: I've played the game a bit more and I have to say this is definitely a 9 and will likely edge higher rather than lower. I really like the choices you have to make in the game and in classic Euro-game fashion... you never seem to be able to do everything you would like with the limited resources you have making for some tough decisions throughout.

Great game, but need more plays to discover different strategies: the first seasons, everybody is playing their own development game, and only in last stages of the game, battles take place but even these are limited.

RATING: 7
Representation of two years of the Thirty Years War. Plan out your moves in advance (battles, get gold, buildings, etc). Novelty in this game is that battles are resolved using the dice tower, where units may get lodged and subsequently come out in future battles. Good solid Euro game with a war game feel to it. Some of the strategy may involve perception, since if you are doing well, people may gang up on you. Game could lead to alliances or nonaggression pacts, which may detract slightly from the game. As an area control game, it does depend on who thinks who is winning, so being invaded maybe out of your control. Longer game, clocks in around 2 1/2 to 3 hrs. Since it is a longer game, if you are doing well, you are likely to enjoy it more than if you are not doing well. One turn of not getting gold can easily wreck your game. Or isolating an area to yourself where you can build churches to earn VPs where no one can attack you will lead to a good game.

I have played Wallenstein many times now, and the game remains a solid 10 for me.  This game is superb -- it is a bit longer than most of the games I play (~3 hrs), but it is completely engrossing for the duration.  The game uses a variety of novel mechanisms that provide _controlled_ randomness, leading to many interesting decisions.  Among these, the battle tower is a standout -- it provides a quick and amusing way to resolve combat, and since unused armies remain lodged in the tower for future battles, players' luck tends to average out much better than dice.  Overall, a stunning game from a master designer!

An interesting area control/confrontation combination.  The cube tower is preferable to dice, but not vastly so.  Despite the fact that it takes about three hours, it still seems too short since there are only six rounds in which actions are taken.  Also, I'm not a big fan of the randomized turn order, and the final turn suicide attacks are totally unrealistic.

I have played this a few times online, and I'm not getting it . . ..  I like the game well enough, but I don't see why this is better than say, Struggle of Empires, which ranks 23 lower, and which I prefer.  Maybe I just don't see the available strategic depth?  It seems that a crowded board and lack of one's ability to predict player movemetns (not to mention the randomization of events) detracts from the game rather than adds to it.  Also, I like the tower and all, but it seems like just another way to randomize combat results?  Like I said, maybe I just don't get it . . . I'll keep trying this one.

Wallenstein has hoodwinked boardgamers into thinking it is a game. It has done so by having all the same components of the standard boardgame, and by having many of the same problems of a boardgame like a long setup time with many fiddly bits and poorly laid out instructions where  important info is difficult to look up. 

The real problem with Wallenstein is the way the game limits the number of each available action and how they are chosen. Basically, all players do approximately the same number of all the same things each turn, the only variation being where each action takes place. The method of choosing each location is done by each player placing a card representing a province they own on a grid of each available action, once. No one is able to devote themselves to doing more of an action than the game permits, which makes play feel arbitrarily limited. This system both removes player's agency in the game and allows the now disinterested players to play completely on auto-pilot, choosing actions by just randomly placing their cards. Worse still, players on auto-pilot actually remain competition for the players still engaged in consciously choosing where their actions occur further highlighting how the arbitrary limitations of Wallenstein restrict players ability to do anything meaningful.

Even Wallenstein's famous cube tower lends itself to this auto-piloting as combat has been boiled down to taking either players involved armies and chucking them down the tower with the winner being decided by whoever's cubes spill out at the bottom.

In effect, all players could randomly play their cards down every turn, and watch how Wallenstein plays out like some kind of machine with zero player involvement. This is not a game! It is a box of parts that looks like a game.

Starting position in this game can matter. Since the goal is more to expand your area and just keep from dying out, battling doesn't seem like a great way to expend your resources. Trying to hold onto territories and buildings is the way to go.

A bit lighter than I would have though. There is also more randomness but fair amount of chaos fits this game both in theme and game mechanics. It is more of a resource management game than wargame. Special bonus goes to the cube tower which is a nice way to resolve battles. Tower offers some surprises dice can not and looks pretty.

A very intriguing game of hidden-selection which in some ways feels very modern and in others belies its age. The cube tower is rightly heralded as a lot of fun (finally! No more endless d6 rolls to settle battles!), and the selection of actions still holds up well, but the scoring doesn't seem to be very dynamic and the random turn-order is frustrating. It's easy to see why this game can be divisive and how it was the trigger for many subsequent refinements.

In the right hands, this should play significantly quicker than its suggested duration.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I found Wallenstein to be a lot of tedious work. I think much of it was because the game had a lot of German text, and it was tedious to have to refer back to a cheat sheet instead of just reading the card/game board. Plus much of the historical flavor and theme is lost without the background text -- you end up playing a fairly abstract game instead of being immersed. I know some people mark up a German-texted game with Enlish paste-ups, but I just can't bring myself to "deface" a game component,  even if it only means pasting over text. I probably didn't give it enough time, but it was also not a 2 player game so it had to go.

MY COMMENTS IN GERMAN TAKEN FROM WWW.UNKNOWNS.DE

2014-12-08: Ansonsten gab es am Mittwoch Wallenstein (erste Auflage), erst meine zweite Partie nach 2 Jahren Pause. Das Regelheft ließ Fragen offen, was immer wieder zu Unterbrechungen führte. Das Cover finde ich übrigens auch potthässlich, weil es sooo schlecht gemalt ist. Dabei hätte man doch ohne weiteres ein gemeinfreies historisches Portrait von Wallenstein benutzen können? Okay, ich kann mir natürlich denken, warum man das nicht wollte, aber das Cover finde ich einfach grottig. Das Spiel selbst finde ich hingegen nach wie vor genial. Im Prinzip ist das ein Hybride, wie man heute eventuell sagen würde, vielleciht ein "Waro" a la Kyklades oder Kemet? Jedenfalls ein aggressives Euro mit zentralem Kampfelement und lustigem Anführermobben und einem saucoolen Kampfsystem.

Great area control game.  Feels like the game could actually be played in a reasonable amount of time (less than the 3 hours my first game took) since there are really only 6 turns.  The revolts add a wonderful element to the taxation/farming resources mechanic.  The more I think about the play, the more I like the game.  Needs to hit the table again soon.

RATING: 7
With only 6 turns, expansion needs to be fast and brutal to obtain the riches you need to build and grow. I like the constraints placed upon you by the pre-programming, but it still falls into the multi-player beat-up issue where you'll win if you're left alone, and if everyone is conscious of keeping the playing field level, then it becomes a bit of a lottery in the last turn. And the luck of the cube-tower adds to the lottery feel. Solid and all, not just totally engaging.

The Thirty Years War raged in Europe in the 17th century and were a bloody chapter in the history of this time.  Catholics and Protestants were fighting for their very survival, and as seems to be the case in religious wars both sides were prepared to do some irreligious things to win.

Wallenstein starts in 1618 and play goes for 2 years or eight seasons.  Players take on the role of a leading figure from the Thirty Years War and attempt to gain more victory points than their opponents by conquering territory.  There are also no group wins here, it’s every player for themselves, even if historically to players may have been on the same side.

Each season is broken down into ten actions, the order of which is determined randomly.  Players secretly plan out their seasons actions by placing province cards over the actions they want to take in that province on their player mat.  You can reinforce provinces, collect gold and wheat, build buildings and attack other provinces.  The random order of these actions means there will be times when someone attacks you and conquers a province you were planning on using to tax for gold or wheat which then makes it harder to perform other actions later.

Gold is important because ot pays for your activities like recruiting or building.  Wheat is important to feed your provinces, and every winter you have to pay the piper and dish out the food.  Not being able to feed a province can cause the peasants to revolt and you can lose provinces if you lose the resulting battle.

Combat is resolved by using the cube tower.  Instead of rolling a bucket load of dice, you get the fun of dropping your armies and your opponents armies (little cubes) involved in the battle into the cube tower and seeing whose armies are left in the tray at the bottom.  No complex modifiers or combat results table this is a fun way to resolve combat that works really well in the context of this game.  Results can be wild and unpredictable, but so is life.  Just don’t expect a historically accurate representation of the Thirty Years War from this game, look to the Musket and Pike series from GMT instead. 

Wallenstein has the right level of strategic planning, and easy to explain rules that I feel I could encourage some casual gamers to give it a shot and I could imagine that they will enjoy playing it.  Overall I found Wallenstein to be a fun game to play, it has managed to find a good balance between complexity and depth and I look forward to further battles with the cube tower.

Very rewarding strategy game with a war aspect. But warfare is far from the only thing this game has to offer. The theme is the thirty years war, and shows germany smashed to shards of micro-countries. Players need to strenghten their split starting position, feed and pay for their troops, rebuild the lands and always be careful, not to overstretch, since the player could easyly be destroyed by internal revolts. Very innovative Cube tower mechanic for combat, which nicely shows the chaos of the portrayed war.

I appreciate the attempt to mix a traditional multiplayer wargame with euro-building mechanics.  That said, I just don't like multiplayer wargames.  What a lot of people don't seem to understand about this game is that it's not about consolidating your forces into one region, it's about defending a number of territories in multiple regions to score your buildings in those regions.

TRY July/04: Very enjoyable game (www.spielbyweb.com).  Cube tower is interesting, and adds a neat randomizing concept without the need to roll MANY dice, consult charts, etc.  But it also removes some of the 'feeling' of control over the outcome, to me; not a bad thing, mind you -- just like being a real army general, I'd imagine!

So this is a game made by the same guy that's responsible for that dull Alhambra game? It makes no sense...

Wallenstein, now this is a game I could play a lot! It's straightforward and slow paced, but it's never boring. It's not a "fancy" design in any ways, but it's totally solid and I predict that Wallenstein has extremly good replayabillity.

Actually I was hesitant to go to war and only used seven or eight of the twelve combat actions. But my heart was beating fast everytime those cubes were thrown into the awsome Cube Tower. 

Have yet to play the "Shogun"-version. But from what I seen I like the artwork and the map better on Wallenstein.

A Euro war game.  What's not to like?  The dice tower is awesome and adds a few surprises, and the hidden planning for the latter 5 phases of the turn is gut wrenching some times.  Other than it's a little long (2.5-3.5 hrs) there's not much wrong with it.

This is a game of finding the right balances and the right moments. It's not a wargame or a traditional economic euro... it's kind of a strange mix.

The programmed actions provide some "aha" moments and there's also a risk management component in the peasant revolts. All of this comes wrapped up in a nice package, with a beautiful map and a cube tower to resolve combat.

[UPDATE]: Didn't play it enough, so I sold it!

One of my favorites.  Has some delightfully difficult choices to make, and you have to plan your actions not knowing exactly what order they'll appear.  Is really a eurogame, but timely and well-calculated conflicts can disrupt a peaceful strategy.  I really enjoy a lot of little things, and the whole is somehow greater than the sum of the smaller mechanics - the yearly peasant revolts, the area control of the buildings, the need to feed your regions, the event cards, the uncertain order of the actions.  Plus the cube tower rocks.  With players on the ball, this game takes less than 2 hours.  150 minutes seems a stretch.

Loved the game.  For me, nearly perfect balance of wargame and Euro-ish concerns.  Elegant handling of actions minimizes time spent pushing pieces, while also retaining a need to attend to "social" matters.  A bit of a random feel due to the impossibly complex calculations of other players' moves, but I expect that over several games optimum play will yield good results.

Wallenstein is extremely dependant on luck and can be a long-playing game.  Ok.  That's the bad news.  The good news is that it is an excellent game, and I am very pleased to own my copy.  The basis of the game is a power-scramble in middle ages Germany, which is dependant on several fluctuating key (and random) things: seasons, farms and farmers, land improvements, soldiers, and revolutions - all tied together by a blind card mechanic and that bastard son of lady luck, the dice tower.

Although my games played are limited over the last months, my interest is always high.  With those that know this game, it's often one that is highly considered, usually losing out to something like Caylus.  Regardless, this is an awesome game in its own right.  Although the edition I own is German language, the iconography is well used to reduce the language requirement.

It can't be a 10, but it will remain a 9 until I play it so many times that it gets into that 10 category, else, dropped in favour.  Still, one of my prized possessions in my collection.

A light wargame played over 6 rounds which have several familiar game mechanics. Limited conflict(twice in a round) is conducted like Risk, but no dice rolls, just throw troops into a tower; this means more focus on what may be trapped in the tower to be considered. Other elements are similar to La Citta: manage wheat production or suffer peasant revolt, and gradual card revelations. The card selecting mechanic was the most interesting: programming your 10 actions to be activated in owned areas. Dilemmas are due to the fact each area card has 2 attributes: wheat and money production; so you may need more troops for a particular area, but that area card will generate more essential wheat. Which one to choose? Alot of random elements means it is a flavoursome ride game to pass 2-3 hours.

This is an excellent game that is just too short. There are only three turns per year (the fourth phase is a scoring phase) and only two years to play. I would love to see this go on for several more "years" as there is simply not enough time for any real empires to develop. In addition to that, the artificial limitation on attacking (only twice per turn) hampers the flow of the game.That said, this is a great game, even in this format.

What I really love about Wallenstein is that it's all about planning.  Given very limited information about how things are going to pan out in the current season (and even less about future seasons), you have to commit to the location for every one of your actions.  There will always be a significant element of chance involved, but wise planning can mitigate the risk.

The other thing that is great about this game is that the short time scale and limited actions make for a very strategic experience.  It is definitely not about amassing the biggest army and stomping across the entire board.  Rather, it is about carefully allocating your resources and keeping yourself well defended against your enemies.

One last note -- I really like the cube tower.  It is by no means perfect, but it does help to smooth out your luck over the course of the game.  Just make sure you don't have too many cubes in there when the game ends!  ;)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I know the gimmick of this game is the cube tower combat, but it's the thing I like least about this game.  I love the area control, I love the decisions you make throughout the game.  And then the tower comes along and does tons of completely non-sensical outcomes.

And I know it supposedly balances things out, but thematically it makes no sense that a battle in one area of the map that went poorly for you will make the other area go well.  And more than that, I don't even like how it balances the game.  It randomly unbalances your troops in ways you can't predict or control.

Take this game and put in another combat method and I would like it a lot more.  Hell, I'll take Risk's dice rolling over the stupid cubes.

I'm actually using the recommended rating scale for this one.  I played this once and can't ever imagine playing again.  It was tedious (way too long) and just didn't flow well.  Not to mention that it's not at all a game you can be very social while playing.  Too much direct confrontation and such.

RATING: 4
This game doesn't have enough fighting!

You have ten actions to perform per round. Only two of those actions involve attacking other players. There are only eight rounds in the game (really only six -- two of the rounds are scoring ones). The problem is that the board is too *big*. It's virtually impossible to attack opponents on the other side of the board. So the game feels like a simple resource management game. Thus, there's much less conflict between players than I'd like.

Bonus points for the cube tower. 

Update: Dropped from 6 to 4. This game is way too long considering how light it is. Too much wasted time on fighting farmers.

I found most of the game mechanics, while innovative and unique, worked against my ability to enjoy this game.  In particular, the highly-touted cube tower which is so very creative still made battles highly unpredictable with insanely illogical outcomes, greatly detracting from game play, in my opinion.  Yeccch.  The method of determining what each province would do each turn, while interesting and creative, was frustrating and produced insanely illogical restrictions, detracting from game play, in my opinion.  The method of, and necessity for, grain collection, while creative, was frustrating and insanely illogical, and detracted from game play.  The last-turn last-ditch effort to score points by making moves that would be insanely illogical on any previous turn detracted from game play.  The method of randomly determining the order of player turns, and the order of actions, was merely frustrating, throwing in an element of randomness that added nothing to strategy or theme.  Event cards and their effects were illogical and added nothing to the game.  There's a good basic game underlying all of these bad additions, and if you took out most of the 'unique and creative' game mechanics to get back to it, it would be a pretty decent game.  Then maybe you could add in some OTHER unique and creative game mechanics that would improve the game instead of spoil it.  I'll give this one a pass, as it stands.  I'd love to see pieces of it in other games, though.

Great game with nice mechanics, even the battle tower can be fun... if you win against the odds ;-))) But also it can be quite frustrating if cube after cube vanishes in the tower and never comes out (it can happen).  You have to decide carefully where and when to expand, conquest is not the key to victory, the buildings are, well of course conquest of regions with many buildings is important.

The tower is a funny thing, but has its own problems. The actions are very limited and as a result the game can feel very tense in the end of the second year. However, this is not a conquest game and real attack possibilities and strategies are few and between.  Somehow I always seem to get picked on in this and get my ass stomped near the end. That hurts =) I would recommend playing this with 5 players. As with these types of games  kingmaking in the end and attack turnorder do effect the outcome. After several games played I have mixed feelings about Wallenstein, maybe there's a bit too much chaos to my taste. As tactics go, you simply take the opportunity when it presents itself. Queen delivers very good components as usual (just a few cards have German in them).

Played a few times. It could be said it's not enough to judge a game. Point is I prefer to avoid to play this game.

Awesome game.  Personally, I think I prefer Shogun because the Japanese setting appeals to me more, but the more concentrated German map opens up some strategic options that are missing from Shogun.  A few of the rules differences in the games surprise me as I found I preferred some of the original Wallenstein rules, but it would be nice to incorporate the Shogun turn auction and special powers.

The cube tower is excellent! But with only six "seasons," it's possible to get very bad luck in turn order. The re-issue of this game (under the name "Shogun") fixes the turn-order problem.

The closest the German games will get to open war fighting. Well-designed action system with simultaneous (and secret) distribution of orders keeps things moving with regular tension throughout.

A solid game in they style of Risk mixed with a Euro - still has a combat focus, but that is not the be all and end all, just the most all.

Re-implemented by Shogun this game of conquest and intrigue has a lot of competitors but it stands up quite well. Players must balance their finances, food supply, military forces and at the same time find the opportunity to purchase or conquer the public works that actually score victory.
The only complaint with the game (and it is common to a lot of games like this in the last ten years) is that the relatively short game length is achieved by a guillotine that stops the game often just as it is getting interesting.

Let's face it: There's a lot of luck in the cube tower. Sometimes it likes you; sometimes it wants to kick your ass. Given that, this is a great game that injects a little randomness into its territorial battles. If you can accept that, it's a lot of fun.

The conflict resolution mechanism adds a nice twist to the game.  Initial concerns (after 1 play) - SBW handles a lot of the bookkeeping very nicely - is it fiddly in person.  Also, does it bog down when played F2F with all the stuff that needs to happen.  I am also concerned if the randomizer elements in the game add too much randomness.  But expect to enjoy the game as I play to find out.

this game has a lot of flaws:
Stupid last turn offensives; long planning phases resulting in only little interaction on the board; mechanical long preparing for offensives; no chance to work against a powerful player in the north, if you are in the south, and the other way round; the more countries you have the more your power will increase (due to the 1 action per card limit); it palys slow, mechanical dry and has nothing to do with the time period it seems to relate to. Call it "bismarck" and it could be a game about german first unification ....

The predecessor to Shogun (not the AV/MB game). a nice fusion of euro and light war gaming mechanics. I enjoy Wallenstein a little more than Shogun. Shogun adds a few more complexities that are mostly unnecessary, except for maybe the turn order bidding. Other than that, I think the symmetrical design of Wallenstein's game board is much more functional than the oblong shape of Shogun's Japan map. All other mechanics remain mostly the same. Both are made by Queen, so the production values are similar. If i had one minor problem with the Wallenstein components, it would be the green tray of the cube tower. It can make it difficult to notice the green peasant cube which blend in. Shogun fixed this problem with a clear tray. 

Area control, preprogramed actions, and an exciting cube tower battle system set this game apart. impressive, elegant and deep.

--Dec2004-- Perhaps surprisingly, given the high rating here on BGG - it didn't do much for me the first time out.  The game is fascinating, but I didn't find it particularly enjoyable.  The interplayer dynamics were far too close to those of Risk (admittedly with some interesting economics and delightfully chaotic combat resolution) for me to muster huge enthusiasm.  On the other hand, the game has grown on me over time - so I find myself wanting to attempt it again.  Hmmm.
--Jun2005-- Tried it again - this time with my nephews.  They all loved it.  I ended with less than half the score of the next worst player.  Maybe it's just me!
--Dec2006-- And despite my low rating, it's a game I still want to bring to the table - even if only to reinforce my delusion that I can't possibly do well at it.

RATING: 8
Often described as a Euro-wargame hybrid, this game uses Euro-style mechanics with a war theme to great success.  More about resource management than actual fighting.  The infamous "Wallenstein Cube Tower" is either a "fiddly randomizor" or a "neat gimmick" - either way, I like it!  It randomizes the individual fights nicely, but weights the odds in favor of those who have more units thrown into the tower.  Better than dice because a)resolves fights quickly and *mostly* fairly, b) adds enough randomness to make fighting dangerous, c) makes multiple losses unlikely if you are fighting with a reasonable number of units.  Best played with a full compliment of players.

Ah, Wally. How to describe the Waro wonderness of this game? Themed on the 30 Years War, this gem has an order placement system similar to AGoT. There are 10 orders possible, and each player has a player mat (mmmmmm, player mats....) with all 10 depicted on it. Each player has a card for each area he controls as well. During the planning phase, 1 card is put on each of the orders on the map, face down. As each order comes up (this is random) the players flip over the card on that order, and it happens in whatever area was placed on the order. Some orders are; move, extract grain/money, raise troops, or build buildings. Buildings are worth 1 VP each at the end of the game, but players earn extra points for having the majority in each type of building for each larger area (there are 5). That brings sort of an area influence aspect, in that multiple players will have buildings of that type in the larger area, and the person with the most scores extra. So spreading out is good, for extra points multiple times over. But watch your back! Cause this aint to TtR, other players with straight up INVADE you! Units are cubes in this game, very euro-like, and they are dropped into the tower for combat. Not all the cubes that go in the tower, come out of the tower. Its a pretty cool way to handle combat. With revolting villages, economic apects, building, limited options, and some guesswork, I'd say this qualifies for a high ranking position in my collection.

Best with 3 as an economic game.

RATING: 8
Technically, this is the same game as Shogun, but on a different map. 

Because Japan is more spread out than Germany, the distances here are smaller, and regions usually have more neighbours, making turtling (a potential problem in Shogun in less experienced groups, especially with standard rule of picking from only two cards during set-up) very difficult and giving everybody more possible targets. Not only one can pick a weakest province to attack, but usually you border with all other players, so you almost always have possibility of bashing the leader, which was often not the case in Shogun.

This results in a more dynamic play, and while many prefer it that way, after a couple of plays in Wallenstein and a couple of dozen in Shogun, I prefer the latter, exactly because of more limited choices, in the sense that usually there are few combinations of orders assigned to provinces are that are visibly better than the rest. Shogun and Wallenstein, even more than most action programming games, require predicting what other players will do. The more 'good' options they have, the more difficult this predicting is, making preparing for most potential attacks almost impossible. This means that luck, or fruitful negotiation is a comparatively more important reason for not being attacked than proper build up of forces, making victory for the opponent less probable or short-lived.

Although may plays so far are too few to form a final opinion, my impression is that a better player (more efficient, better at double-guessing their opponents) has higher probability of winning Shogun then Wallenstein.

Great, great game. Favorite for strategists and builders, but all player types like it. A great mixture between developing your lands and conquering lands of (and annoying) other players. Also nice: the historical background and the tower. The tower is a really nice bit of design. To resolve a battle both players throw in their armies. Inside are some barriers, which can hold back some of the armies, on the other hand other armies, which have been inside might fall out as well. That way you can never be sure to win a battle, but have to calculate risks. A fun part of our games is the depletion of the tower at the end of the game, to see how many armies of each player have been eaten by the tower. Awesome.

RATING: 5
Impulse buy (without having played) that I regret after my first play with the full complement of 5 players. I thought this would be the killer euro/waregame hybrid I've been yearning for, but it felt very dry, abstract, and pointless. The battles in the cube tower were not thrilling. Winner is the one who scored most over several rounds in categories of # of regions controlled and numbers of 3 different types of buildings in each region ... yawn. There are graphic design issues that make the game difficult to play, such as grain and gold values not being shown on the map itself but rather on a chart on your player board that you have to cross reference.

I like the fact that most of the thinking is done before the turn, in the planning stage, and then the execution is more seat-of-the-pants.

Rated after one play.  This is a good game, particularly if your game collection isn't deep. If you have a lot of games, you find many of the mechanics in other games. Also for me the game seemed over before it began. 

There are only 8 turns, 2 of which are just checking to make sure you have enough grain to feed your armies. While quite a bit happens during those other 6 turns, I felt things were just getting interesting and then it ended.

The "sameness" and gameflow compelled me to trade this away. I may regret it at some point, but at least the rumored reprint with a Samurai theme sounds more interesting to me thematically.

I don't generally like wargames AT ALL, and I despise dice based combat.

This is still a very good game, blending Eurogaming concepts: event cards, resource allocation, actions, etc... with light conflicts. It is only 6 turns long, and you can only initiate 2 conflicts per turn, which means that a lot of it is about the other stuff.

The drawbacks: if you fall behind, you are likely to stay behind, one of the insufferable problems in many wargames. Wallenstein plays quickly, however, so you don't have to suffer much. The other is the random factor involved in conflict - not dice, but a cute little tower that you throw your armies into, some of which fall out again. Not my thing, but the best I've seen in non-deterministic conflict, so far. It is at least quick (not a long series of rolls) - but still feels unfair and silly when the outcome is grossly skewed in one direction. That's wargames for you, take it or leave it.

This is a political area control game with some nifty mechanisms (building, resource management, feeding your populations,  farmer revolts, battles employing the cube tower, aggressive and non-aggressive choices, etc.) and enough substance to really burn the brain at times.

It can also be a very chaotic game of outguessing your opponents when played with 4 or 5 players. The language "barrier" of the Queen edition is not really a factor. The cube tower is a nifty way to resolve battles, it both creates and also mitigates bad luck over the long term.

The board and bits are quality and attractive. Enough wargame elements to please some wargamers and a share of tactics and strategy for the Euro crowd. (However, I don't think this game would go over with casual gamers. Their brains would freeze up and that would be the end of the fun for them.) 

Most recent play 7-21-09 with Corey, Alex, and Joel on SbW.

My God, the box is huge! We all know about the dice tower which is novel and works well. The game is more about area control and selection of actions than it is about combat. However, having said that, it passes quickly. Having to choose 10 actions is alot to do yet still isn't ever enough!

Games are usually tense affairs as you have to balance money with grain supply with building and troop movement. The two year turns passes very very quickly. Me? I usually don't build any buildings but instead choose to invade countries that have built.

The battle resolution is always entertaining, even when my troops aren't involved. Other than that, this feels like a fairly standard euro resource management game, the kind of game that I find only moderately interesting.

RATING: 9
Opened the box and it was love at first sight. Love the tower (as a cool bit and mechanism), like the action planning, limited points for majorities (a sloppier designer would have put those values higher) - it's a real, meaty game that is enormously fun. More confrontational than most German games, but nice for a change of pace. After many plays and even a little play with the Shogun variant, the magic is still there. Wish I could get it to the table more but at least I can keep playing it on SpielbyWeb.

RATING: 6
This game is ranked 10th on BGG and is almost certainly overrated. I like the simultaneous action selection, and the opportunity for planning, but the cube tower is an odd bit of hocus pocus. What is it supposed to simulate? Why would losses in early battles benefit the outcome of later battles? Another issue is that there never seems to be enough time to do what I'd like to do. Wallenstein doesn't quite measure up as either a wargame or a euro game.

RATING: 8
A nice mix of resource management and war game: to win you need to build buildings but to hold onto them and get ahead you need defence.  Add to that you need to make money and gather enough grain to feed your empire and there is some tough decisions to be made.  5 player is particularly tense and is my preferred way to play.  Some of the rules are somewhat odd (only can gather grain in one province despite the huge empire I control??) but these are balancing effects.  The mid-game scoring can lead to a bash the leader in the second half but I do think that skillful and careful play is rewarded and that delicious tension really makes it worth playing.

RATING: 10
Excellent, subtle game.  Unlike other Risk style games, goodies are not automatically rewarded for conquest: you must carefully extract them without angering the peasants.  Players in the center must be ready to abandon the mindset of fixed borders and think in terms of migrating, opportunistic empires.  Many fascinating factors are beautifully balanced without producing an overwhelming burden of rules.

Great mix between Euro and a War game.  Luck plays a big factor in this one as there is some blind guessing as to match what others are doing, guessing when actions will be available and then there is always the dreaded cube tower.  Lots of fun, though, keep you engaged even when you get your ass handed to you.

A few FTF, several at spielbyweb. 

As others have said, this is not so much a wargame as it is an area-control game with an interesting mechanism for resolving conflict (cool tower!). It seems closer to El Grande than to ... Risk. Very cool tightness in the game - only being able to issue 1 order/country/season, you cannot do everything you want to do as quickly as you'd like - have to plan ahead. But I think Struggle of Empires is better as an area-control / eurowargame. Down from an 8 (after initial play) to a 7 - would like to try more FTF games, though.

3 plays.

The game always seems to end up more "static" than I keep expecting it to be. Only a few big battles seem to occur in any game and the rest is just optimising building efficiency.

Based on 1 play online. I never got the rules. Bored me, wanted to drop out half way through. I'd give this another try (in person only) but only if I was needed to get minimum player requirements or if there was nothing else to play.

I do not care for the tower mechanism and the peasants revolting if you harvest grain or tax them, but then revolt if you don't have enough grain for the winter annoys me. In general, I've also grown very "meh" on anything resembling a war game.

RATING: 8
Played both this and Shogun once. Since they're basically the same, I'll leave the same comment and rating for both.

This is a long game, with lots of repetition each turn, but I still like it. There's a good balance between conflict and building stuff to generate VP. You really can't ignore either; what's the right mix depends greatly on other players' actions, and your response to them. So strategies should be flexible, but still a bit focussed. Hope to see the game length reduce with further plays, as I would really like to play this more often.

Overall a good game.  This is a somewhat lighter "wargame" that doesn't focus so much on the fighting aspect as it does on managing resources and acquiring victory points.  I like the pace of the game and how you plan out what you are going to do each turn by laying down territory cards on action spaces.  The grain mechanism is also well done to keep expansion-hungry players in check.  The cube tower is also a very intersting, if somewhat random, method of combat resolution.  All in all this is an enjoyable game that features some good strategic challenge and plays under 2 hours.  I felt the game underemphasized combat somewhat, but there are other games that can fill that need.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
[Queen Games 2002 edition] {War Game; dice-rolling, variable-phase, variable-player-order; optimal 5p} Wallenstein is a nice war game with a strong theme and some intuitive mechanics - variable phases, action cards, hidden action order and the dice tower.

It may look too random to novice players due to the random player order, unknown 5 action phases, dice tower and event cards. I kind of understand why there is so much hidden information during a turn because there is already too much information to digest during a turn; having more information may lead to a longer down time. As it seems many uncertainties and luck in moves, some players would complain it's too random that they cannot control.  The hidden action order affects all players; I think it's fair enough.  If a player depends too much on some projected action order, it's his problem. 

The combat system is luck-depending due to player order and the dice tower dice. However, I think a good strategy and diplomatic skill is MORE essential to win this game.  Besides, wars are frequent enough in 5p game to balance the randomness. The randomness just forces a player to prepare for better odds before declaring a war. Besides, players should develop good strategy and tactical moves to deal with uncertainties in the player and action order.  From my experience, players who frequently complain are the ones play too aggressively and unwisely depend too much on a single move/country/war. As Wallenstein requires player with much planning mind and diplomatic skills, it's easy for some players to complain that it's not fun.

In all, it's a deep game that forces players plan wisely for possible moves, actions and events. Without a better risk-taking and contingency plan, players will just fall flat in Wallenstein. I do agree with other Geeks that players have to plan wisely with partial information in Wallenstein, rather than reactive moves. If you only like games that you can react quickly about how other players play (with most information in hand), stay away from Wallenstein.

[Shogun] The core system is similar but the special cards allow players to have "more?" controls. However, this small different does not justifies buying one more game.

I like everything about this game--the strategies, the planning, the resource management, the conflict. Perfect. My only minor gripe is that for a game themed around war, it's unfortunate that the player that avoids conflict is more likely to win.

A very good game with tough decisions and a suitable addition of luck (with the hidden actions, events and the tower). The tower is just wonderful. There are two drawbacks (that come in mind): The colors on the components don't appeal to me very much (makes it look like an old game), but it doesn't matter that much as the mechanics and gameplay are great. The other is that it seems to last quite a while (the games I've played have lasted about 3 hours), but then again I think it's worth the time and there's practically no downtime.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A true mix of a war game and a Euro - well, I may not play enough war games to be qualified to say that, but it at least satisfies people that don't want to play games unless you get to attack.  

Lots of luck in this game, but luck that is the residue of good design as opposed to blind luck.  I.e. you need some memory as to who has more cubes left in the tower, and you have some planning around the actions that you don't know are coming.  

Overall, a very enjoyable experience that is long but not overly so.  

A few problems:
1.  Actions planning should be done relatively quickly.  If someone is taking a long time it removes the benefit of simultaneous action planning.  This can really hurt the game.
2.  Especially in a three player game, there can be incentive to hole up out of everyone else's way which makes for a more static game than one might like.  
3.  No scoring track comes with the game, nor any victory point markers.  This is easy to correct, but still annoying.

Those are pretty much nits, the main thing is that combat and tactical strategy isn't as well developed as a wargame and economic resource management isn't as well developed as in a Euro, but both are done well enough making this a fine addition even at the current price.  

I suppose a more major complaint would be that I don't feel I have as much control in this game as I would like - not just because of the luck elements, but because you only get three turns per year.  I think the chaos and lack of strategy probably fits well with the theme and the game is long enough as it is, but that lack of control keeps this from being one of my very favorite games. Still, I really like it and it tends to be pretty popular.

(Probably rates an 8 or 9 for 4 or 5 players and a 7 for three players.)

Quite impressive!  The game plays well and the tower combat resolution thingamajig is really quite clever.  Although it looks like a wargame at first glance, but standard wargame tactics don't really work.  Agonizing decisions to be made each turn--strengthen forces?  Attack?  Build?  Definitely a game worth owning.

This is what would happen if Risk were fun.

What makes this game a 9+ is using the cube tower to resolve combat. It works really well and it's just goofy enough that it takes the edge off of what's actually a serious, tense, and brutal (thanks to peasant uprisings) game. Tossing cubes into that tower and holding your breath (and being delicate to not bump the table and change the result) forces you to have a good sense of humor about the inevitable casualties to war or starvation. That tower is basically a happiness factory.

A german game for mechanics and components, but with a touch of wargame that makes it interesting. It seems too long for what happens during the game. Defensive is a key strategy, IMHO. With tower as mechanic sometimes happens strange result from combat.

The beauty of this deep, fun game is that the planning is done simultaneously.  It carries the 2+ hour timeframe well, the time speeds by.

It requires that attacking is carefully planned out.  Great game.

I have no idea how this game managed to be in the top 50.  This totally chaotic piece of garbage should never have been printed.  Its like someone put a whole bunch of game mechanics into a pile, then threw it up into the air.  Which ever mechanics fell face up they put into the game.  Now that I'm done ranting, let me tell you why this game really blows.

The "Random" Tower is the worst idea ever.  I love attacking a country with a 4 to 1 cube advantage only to have 2 peasants fall out and 3 enemy cubes, so he ends up with a net "gain" of 1 cube.  Its insane.  Or having a defensive advantage ending in a tower tie so the area is "laid waste"!  When we emptied the tower at the end of a 3 player game, 2 of us had "5 CUBES EACH" lost in the tower while the lucky one only had 2!  If your cube gets stuck in a corner its gone for the entire game.  It's basically paying for a resource and then putting it back in the box. Your only hope is that someone bumps the table.  I have this crazy suspicion that no engineers had anything to do with the tower design.  The tower needs to be in a place that wont get bothered by accidents.  That means you need to dig a ten foot deep hole and then build a pillar rising 4 foot in the air so that no accidental josteling occur.

If you are the unlucky player who gets most of his provinces in the center of the board, well then say hello to destruction as you get nailed from all sides.  Again random.  Dont even bother building if you get in that position.  You just should give your opponants your cash to save you the trouble of them attacking you.  The only strategic idea in this game is to have your back to a wall, then there will be one side you won't have to worry about!

The action sequence is an absolute travesty.  Lets plan a fantastic first 5 actions, only to have turn order screw you first then the next 5 "random" actions totally blow it for you second.

Lastly, if you have outraged peasants in your province then they should fight for the attacker, Not the Defender. I have never heard of an outraged peasant wanting to help fight for someone who just stole their food and then raised their taxes.  Those peasants could only hope for a new regime change.

So in conclusion: Terrible mechanics, Terrible strategy, Terrible "Tower", TERRIBLE GAME!

This game is great and unique for a number of reasons: First of all: The combat system. Not all predictable, but much fairer than a dice based system (as your "stuck" armies might help in later combats. Second: The action system is great too. Most of the players thinking is done simoutaneously, so waiting time is reduced. Finally the game is even nicely playable and pretty fast to understand by unexperienced players. Only the rules are a disaster in my opinion.

Clever mechanics, tense play, and the best random results generator ever designed. This game really rewards maintaining a tricky balance between expansion and development.

One of the best German boardgames I've played.  This medium/light wargame is best played with 4 or 5.  Although there's quite a bit of setup time involved, the actual game goes quickly and most of the actions are taken simultaneously (there is a player order to resolve in what sequence battles and other conflicting actions occur).  This is one of the few light wargames where logistics is intelligently done and is a crucial factor in composing your strategy.  If I have to come up with any criticisms at all, its that the cube tower could have had a sturdier base and turtling among skilled players can make strategic choices in later portions of the game a real headscratcher.  Although I do not have the reprint (Shogun from RGG), pick it up if you get the chance.

This game is alright.  Planning out the turns is alright.  The bluff cards are alright.  Balancing between military power and domestic power is alright.  The cube tower is awesome.  

UPDATE: This game is probably a bit overrated here at the geek, but it does create decisions and good pre planning.    The games do however, tend to have the same flavor from game to game.  Players will occupy the same relative locations from game to game, and carve out the niche on the map.  The novelty of the tower starts to wear off, and whats left is an okay game that doesn't fit my tastes.

One of the best games I own.  Just wish I could get more games in as my group just isn't overly interested in it. 

Update: After a turmultuous period of financial unrest in which a friendly neighboring faction supplied the financial needs in exchange for the box of Wallenstein the glorious day has come when thanks to the existence of BGG I have managed yet another fine trade to reacquire this amazing game...and yes I wanted Wallenstein and not Shogun. :)

Fantastic game.  I really like simultaneous action selection and this one uses it very nicely so that everyone plans out their entire turn at once, and then reveals their actions together.  The limit of only being able to do one thing per province each turn can be very restrictive and does make the board a little more static, but it makes for some difficult decisions.  The cube tower tops it all off as a great mechanism for resolving combat that infuses the game with some luck, but makes the luck balance out in the near future more than with dice since your cubes are bound to come out evenutally in a later battle if they get stuck on an earlier fight.

Maybe it was because I was playing with three experienced players and another new guy (who was left alone most of the game), but after getting ganged up on and unable to defend, much less recover, any territories, my first play of this game left me flat.  The Analysis Paralysis pretty much did me in as well, since it was taking everyone else 10-15 minutes to decide where to play their cards - only to have 1 or 2 stop and completely re-place their hand after someone played a card.  Won't play again if this is representative of the game.

I can tell the game has interesting mechanics, but it just didn't click with me. Area control just must not be my thing. I did like how it made sure you couldn't have one super-region that did everything for you, and how it stresses diversification but punishes spreading resources too thin. Altogether, though, the style of game has little appeal to me. At least that cube tower is nifty.

RATING: N/A
Historically, Albrecht von Wallenstein, duke of Friedland and Mecklenburg, was one of the most important mercenary commanders of the Imperial army during the Thirty Years' War (1618-48). His overweening ambition was to head a large central European empire, which got him dismissed in 1630. Such was his power, however, that the empire was forced to reinstate him when Sweden came into the fray. He recovered Bohemia, but was defeated by Gustavus Adolphus at Lützen, and was again dismissed. His subsequent intrigues with Protestant forces alarmed the Catholic princes who were probably complicit in his assassination in 1634 by Irish mercenaries at Eger, Bohemia.
The game begins with the start of the war, each player controlling several countries. Player actions include the conquest of new countries, tax collection, erection of buildings (i.e. development of the economy), feeding the populace, victualing the army, etc. Some actions increase the chance for unrest, and expensive rebellions can occur. The strongest power at the end wins.

Great game which seems to get better as players get more experienced. Rating only on the basis of 4 and 5 player sessions. Playable in little more than 2 hours for players who played it before, the game strikes the right mix between strategy, tactical vision and luck. Rules are easy to read and teach. The game is unique in that it is part wargame and part "majority" game (given that it rewards majorities in certain areas). Great components round off the package nicely...the oversized gameboard is especially inviting.

Played this game twice and I have to say I love this game. The only thing I like and hate about this game is the cube tower. Yes, its a randomizer and I hate it. Yet I love it for its uniqueness and quirkiness for resolving combat. I can be frustrating, but it sure beats rolling dice in resolving combat.
Overall, the game play is very Euro-esque and this is as close to a wargame I will ever get and I love it. I enjoy the push and pull mechanism of the game but I am looking forward more to Shogun since I think thematically, I enjoy it more. Kudos! Great great game.

Wallenstein is a remarkably accessible light wargame more about resource management and building majorities than fighting. The tower component is novel but, hardly, the entire show. The card distribution for events and actions give each turn and, ultimately, the entire game a quality of uncertainty. Long term strategies are tenative at best. Or so it seems. It will take multiple plays for me to decide if the luck element is too great. That said, I really enjoyed the ever constricting turns of events. After a few more plays, I find this is a very enjoyable and smart game with only one downfall. It's just too long to pull out more than once every couple of months. If I had more time to play it, it would rate higher!

I promised a write-up of 'Wallenstein', and here it is, belatedly. This game is about the Thirty Years War and the various attempts of the main protagonists to get their way. With this in mind, we endeavoured to recreate the chaos and the shennanigans of the period after an excellent explanation of the rules by one Mikey Brown, so no KRO's. I miss KRO's...

Each player has the same number of mercenary armies dotted across five historical states over which the conflict will be fought between the Catholics and the Protestants. Whilst there is military conflict encouraged in a game about conquest, after all, players must also keep track of their population as no one wants a horde of starving peasants knocking on their castle doors! Players then take turns to select from two drawn principalities (territories) or randomly from the top of the deck which should be shuffled well. Ours most certainly was!

Armies ranging in several sizes, are then placed in these territories, according to the choice of the commander in charge represented by the player. Ideally, you look to spread your armies wisely, but in our game, only myself and one other player secured a principality in one of these regions. I think it was Bohemia but I may be mistaken....Army placement can also be done randomly, I understand, but we decided to be cavalier. These armies are there, not only to threaten opponents, but to seek control from the mobs as territories that have been taxed and/or raided for produce will revolt, and internal conflict arises.

One of the two main features I like about this game is that over the course of two years, with four seasons in each, players assign five of ten action cards, corresponding to their own player mat, on which they have secretly assigned how these territories will be utilised. For produce, revenue or tax. There are also five blank cards for bluffing. There are two potential conflict cards as well as ones for other activities, previously referenced. The order these are placed will vary each turn, as will the order in which they are resolved, as a separate deck with the player identities is used each season during the course of the game.

in the last turn of our game, I was unable to raise revenue, or produce, because they were dealt in the last five hidden action cards although this affected all of us to a degree, so over several plays, it will even out. Uncertainty adds spice to the idea of making hay whilst the sun shines! Victory points are also allocated for erecting buildings of significance such as castles, churches and guild houses, and having majorities of these in several territories can be crucial. Victory in war within these areas allows the vivtor to destroy them, although an option to restore them might be interesting, so preventing influence as scoring is done at the end of each full year. There are also four season events which are drawn randomly and usually involve some kind of famine.

Peasants feature quite strongly in this game. Mistreat them and they will rebel. This can be most inconvenient, when as I did on this occasion, have very small armies to defend them which were overrun using my second favourite feature. Probably my most favourite feature - the dice tower! Like Marmite, you either love it, or hate it. There is no in between. The cubes representing armies, which can be reinforced at cost (like most of the action card options to a degree), are dropped into the dice tower and the numbers compared. Initially, there will only be those thrown in for the first combat. it gets more interesting when cubes from a previous combat fall to the tray with those put in. There were some unexpected results although cube numbers are identical for each player so it should be fairly easy to expect this although not necessarily that number fall out! 

Historically, Albrecht von Wallenstein, duke of Friedland and Mecklenburg, was one of the most important mercenary commanders of the Imperial army during the Thirty Years' War (1618-48). His overweening ambition was to head a large central European empire, which got him dismissed in 1630. Such was his power, however, that the empire was forced to reinstate him when Sweden came into the fray. He recovered Bohemia, but was defeated by Gustavus Adolphus at Lützen, and was again dismissed. His subsequent intrigues with Protestant forces alarmed the Catholic princes who were probably complicit in his assassination in 1634 by Irish mercenaries at Eger, Bohemia. This comes straight from the BGG blurb and is included for some (abridged) context! 

An excellent game which I would like to play again. perhaps Rod might bring it on Friday, as I may not have chance to review the 'Hail Caesar' rules in time. I look to rectify my mistakes, common with the other two players, in that most reinforced armies were located in one of the least strategically important areas. Highly recommended.

There are ten actions that can be performed each turn and players must limit each action to one country.  This throttles back the overwhelm-your-opponent strategy I dislike in other dice-based wargames.  Not to mention that this game doesn't use dice, but a randomizing tower in which armies go in and may come out or may stay behind for a later fight.

RATING: 7
Excellent strategical game requiring forthough, well timed execution, and self-restraint. You cannot overextend and survive. I think it captures quite a bit of the feel of the Thirty Years' War struggle with keeping the troops fed and the people happy.

The tower is an ingenious system to resolve conflict.

Update: Did play it a few times, and it was underwhelming. Some nice ideas (love the planning aspect) but the guesswork was not so fun. The tower is great in theory, but the game is too short (in turns, but too long in real time).  It feels like the middle of a really long but more interesting game, with the beginning and end arbitrarily chopped off.

Beautiful game, but not one I could get to the table even with laminated English cards, etc.  Not a terrific theme for average folks, I guess.

Our games of Wallenstein tend to be pretty long (about an hour per player).  A real brain-burner - lots of important choices each round.  The dice-tower is pretty random,  but felt very controlled most of the time - most people enjoyed using it as a novel way to resolve combat.  Not a game you can pick up and master - consequences are tough to predict.  A little fiddly - to find out grain and wheat for provinces you don't own involves looking things up on a table - would have been nice to have markers on the board or somesuch.  A lot of guessing what other players will do - everyone wants to do many things,  but only being able to perform each action once,  and only one action per province makes for nail-biting choices.

Now this IS a game.  Seems like it will be difficult to play but the mechanics are simple.  The things to think about, to decide on, the tower, the balance and the strategies - well these just make for a perfect game.  Yes this is a perfect game - they do exist.

Sort of 'eurogame meets wargame'. Rules feel heavy when reading but upon playing it has a light feel to it (which reminds me of Puerto Rico).

Incredibly elegant blend of wargame and euro-style play (more euro than wargame, but still).
And I can't get enough of that tower, which replaces dice and makes it more likely that, after a couple of bad results, you're pretty much bound to get a good one (whereas dice could roll against you all night...).
Always looking forward to the next game.

A game that's plays near identically to Shogun.  I personally prefer the theme of shogun, but this game is also fun and has many of the same mechanics.

The cube tower is neat of course, and adds unpredictability to the game play.

Played a few times face to face and once on SBW (with 4 or 5 players). Some nice mechanisms and a good combat system (the tower works really well and certainly improves the fun factor a lot) make that a game I like, despite some irritating points, but somehow I end up playing it quite rarely - which makes we wonder whether my rating is not a bit too high. I'm eager to try the new version Shogun, although the German theme appeals more to me than the Japanese one.

Believe the hype. A tremendous game. When Risk dreams, it dreams of Wallenstein. Only flaw is that the approaching end-game creates a go for broke mentality that would not be sustainable in a true "war."

Better than the Shogun retheme, but then I'm very interested in the Thirty Years War, so I'm biased. This is part wargame, part resource management and part 'kick the revolting peasants'. A great game, but one that requires a few hours investment.

Was expecting something heavier but it really felt more like a normal Euro than a war game.  The cube tower is a perfect compromise between rolling dice and deciding a battle based solely on superior numbers.  Never really bogged down at any point.  I liked how just about everything was implemented, the only thing that struck me as somewhat odd was how the tower was seeded prior to the game, effectively starting certain people with handicaps for no apparent reason.

A cute game, with a bunch of very interesting mechanisms, such as the simultaneous secret action planning and the very cool cube tower and some tough choices have to be made. However, it is much too long and too fiddly for what it is. I also missed some kind of story arc, ie. tension doesn't build up towards the end and there's no sense of real progress over the course of the two rounds. This feels like a game where you "do stuff and at the end somebody wins".

Rating after one playing; I really liked this one more than I expected.  There's a lot of resource management to the game, which appeals to me.  The fighting was interesting with the battle tower (and there wasn't nearly as much of it as I thought there was going to be).  Thing is, the game seems somewhat static; yes, there are things going on, but there's not a whole lot of movement (in fact, the way the planning stage is set up, there can't be a ton of movement).  This is frustrating and balanced.  Also to note that because of this lack of movement, you should be able to spot your weaker areas and reinforce them appropriately.  Upon further playings, I am not as enamoured with Wallenstein as the general BGG populace.  It's an interesting design, but not a whole lot of story arc.  Let's see: the way actions come up each season are random, the event for each season is random.  Is a player going to attack you or not?  Random.  Troops that come out of the tower: mitigated randomness.  Why is this game fun again?

What would happen if someone applieg "german gamemaking principles" and applied it to a War Game? Wallenstein!! Always a favorite of our group, the game follows a predictable pattern; build-up in the first year, with careful attacks planned in the second to maximum territory and building gain. The battle tower is cheesy, but used to good effect. Battles, more often than not, end in utter devistation on both sides which is both a good and a bad thing for this game.  The global event mechanic is brilliant!

Great euro-wargame. I like that attacks are sooo expansive. It's always a big risk to attack someone. Overall you get a game with the best of different categories: a little majority game, some ressource management, simultanous action selection and a bit of a wargame. The great components add enough to make it a 9.

I suck at this kind of fight and conquer games but I still like them. Wallenstein is especially very nice.

Really good game with 4-5 players. You should get Shogun instead though. Recommended.

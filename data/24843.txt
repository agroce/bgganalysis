There's a "Settlers" feel to the game. The principles are the same - get resource cards and improve your infrastructure - but there is less luck in the number and type of resources you acquire and more scope for different strategies particularly with the variable victory conditions. Recommended.

A fabulous civ building game in Norse Greenland one thousand years ago. Given the historical circumstances that the Norse were facing in Greenland, Graenaland is (for a eurogame) remarkably accurate in its theming. Rather than plundering each other (which they couldn't really afford to do, given the sparse population of a few thousand), resource allocation is determined by voting at the local council. In the game, the proposals and votes are frequently pretty obvious (keeping the game from bogging down in perpetual negotiations), but Graenaland shines when no player holds a clear majority in a territory: it's the best negotiation game I've encountered! And whether you work cooperatively with your opponents, or it's every jarl for himself, that's entirely up to how YOU want to play it. Mind you, I can't see how a player could win without some degree of cooperation. Victory conditions (in the advanced [and far better!] game) are hidden, and so one is facing a great deal of uncertainty throughout the game with regards to what your opponents are up to.
The negatives? It is a fairly lengthy game, by today's standards, but I think you're looking at two hours in a worst case scenario for experienced players. As well, board and bits are great, but they're a tad on the small size: a bigger version of this is very much in order. Also, be warned! DON'T play this game with AP prone players!

RATING: 5
A second cousin of Settlers with some interesting mechanics and a touch of Norse flavour.  A pity then that many decisions seem mundane; propose a division of resources where you are able to take the most, build whatever you can.  Passing up an opportunity to build just seems a way to fall behind.  Graenaland is a good-looking game, though the differentiation between the landscape types could have been clearer.

RATING: 8
Exelent game. Really like the way that the game rewards co-op playing without forcing you. You could stab others, but then the game turns much harder to win and it lasts longer. Last round stabs are probably more played in the advanced game as you try to secure the resources to claim victory. The advanced games hidden player spesific victory conditions are the last impovement to make this game a gem. 

A really nice suprise, as i was not expecting much of the game. 

-update. Will not play again with five players

Some nice ideas.  Once the game gets going there is a nice rhythm to the moves.  The suggested 5 player start positions in the basic game appear unbalanced.  Players 3 and 5 are positioned at the ends and can access fewer land tiles AND those tiles yield fewer rock resources, which is the key building material.  Turn order in the basic game also appeared significant with player 2 winning and the others being in a position to win on their turn had player 2 not already finished.

Advanced rules - a much better game.  I understand the intentions of putting in an entry level game, but I think the publishers did themselves a disservice.  Rating initially increased 6.5 to 7.5.  However...

Most recent play gave rise to an unpleasant experience.  The player to my left objected to my building in the start up space he had placed his leader, thinking I was attacking him.  It is not that sort of a game.  Building in one area was one of my easy win options, but also my opponent%u2019s.  Having both committed to the same space we couldn%u2019t restart elsewhere.  Will not play with same player again.  It is an unfortunate consequence of having a large choice of winning combinations.  Rating reduced to 7.

Have only played the Simple Game.

Three players does not provide much in the way of actually splitting goods, it just becomes a power struggle to control the goods.

Took a long time last night (2.5 hours), but with AP-prone players.

Need to try it with 4 or 5 again.

Update:

Played with 4.  Still far too many power plays, not enough real distribution.  Takes far to long to get interesting.  More cards being generated at once might help (yeah, the improvements should do this, but they don't do enough, I find).

I feel like the game should get good at some point beyond the 3-point finish, but that it will take 4 hours to get to the "good" point as is.

Verdict:

Too much power-playing, not enough actual "voting."  Leads to a boring result.

RATING: 5
"Graenaland" is an ingenious resource management and negotiation game. It's essentially a reinvention of Settlers of Catan, but the twists are that the victory conditions for each player change from game to game and the modular map with the variable reosurces is surprisingly new and different. Trading has been replaced by equally simple negotiation and cooperation mechanics. And all the building and publics works aspects of that game (and its expansions) have been distilled and condensed into one neat package. Its knocks are that the theme is even drier than Settlers' and there are times near the end-game when it feels and looks like any other process-driven Euro. However, thanks to the variable victory conditions, it's not so rote. One play. Could go up...

RATING: 6
Provisional rating, likely to alter with more plays.

Feels a bit like settlers - except I quite like this one (so far) and I loathe settlers! Trading has been replaced by negotiation and luck of the die roll has been replaced by flip of the card (each area generates resources, distribution of the resources varies). Wood is clearly the least valuable commodity (unless you want a church).

Not sure it works with 3 players, but seems solid with 4. Not sure about 5, the one game we tried dragged and people lost interest - but that might have been the players rather than the game!

** Update, I've had a love/hate relationship with this game (hmm, perhaps that's a bit strong) - had it, liked it, didn't see much play, traded it away. Then got another copy in a trade ... 

*** Update, now traded the 2nd copy, doubt I'll play this again now, and I feel a bit sad about that, wanted to like it more than I did, wanted the gaming experience to be better than it was. Just needed the right group of players.

Cambiado a Sguerrero en la Bsk por un Tempus, de Wallace. Me llegó el 5/10/10
De 3 a 5 jugadores. Mejor a partir de 4. Trata de colonizar groelandia por parte de los vikingos. No hay conflictos bélicos, todo se resuelve por votación.  En cada turno hay un jugador principal, que es el único que puede construir. Al principo del turno el territorio genera recursos. Después los jugadores mueven sus héroes (en cubierto y simultáneamente) para distribuir sus influencias como mejor le convenga. Después se desvela y resuelven los movimientos y cada jugador, puede hacer una propuesta de reparto de recursos de un territorio que se somete a votación. Votan todos los jugadores presentes en el territorio. Por ultimo, el jugador principal puede construir con el fin de mejorar sus influencias. El primero en conseguir 3 de las 5 condiciones de victoria, gana el juego.
Interesante y entretenido.

Rating based on two plays.  It's an okay game -- vaguely like Settlers except with cards+negotiation instead of dice for resource distribution.  The negotiation is probably what makes it less enjoyable than it should be for our group, because negotiation games tend to break down into bickering.

RATING: 7
The only reason I give Graenaland a 7 instead of an 8 (or maybe even a 9) is its length. Granted that negotiation games are not for everyone, Graenaland has some great stuff going on. Players can be ruthlessly non-cooperative, and it can lead to a very long game, indeed. Gaining ground by yourself is very hard without at least some help from the other players. Or players can work together, building public works and sharing resources in tempo with the main player building cycle, and the game might end in 70 minutes or so. Working more or less "together" leads to shorter games, but it may make the finish closer than some might want, especially when using the variable victory conditions cards. Overall, Graenaland is an excellent game for people who like negotiation, trading and building games. But if you hate area majority, negotiation and/or trading, you might want to pass this one by.

Need to try it again, but it may have a "leader wins" problem as everyone is fairly even.  On the last turn, foru of the five players could have won the game, but only the first player had the option.  Definitely need to try it again.  The mechanics (voting, simultaneous movement) are what really make this game different.

Played twice at time of original rating.  There's something about this game that strikes a chord, I think it's the fact that one small vote can become so significant with the fact that everyone only gets one proposal per turn, the "threats", and "favours" aspect of playing nasty and friendlily against other players.  A nice mix of resource management and player interaction
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Basic jist: you have influence in areas based on the houses you build there, and a few guys that can wander around. Areas spawn cards each turn, and the person with the most influence can simply take any cards that are present. If there is a tie, then one can suggest a split, and the other person there has to approve it for the cards to be divvied. The three moving pieces you can have all wander around and have different strengths and weaknesses.

Really, not a bad game, but not a particularly good one either. Everything locks together well, but it also seemed to lock together a little too well. Everyone was completely neck and neck the whole way, and there seemed to be very little room to really pull off the amazing play because of the restrictions of the system.

The movement of the pieces also ended up being boring and I think an apt way to describe it is a prolonged Mexican Standoff. No one wants to flinch, and the player pieces tend to just sit around staring at each other until someone can develop army technology. Even then, there tends to be a do-si-do of the church man and the army, which doesn't end up being all that exciting.

The only really promising aspect is that players can collude to build special buildings in areas that they share which benefit anyone who is present, but not very much of that was getting done. Majorities also seemed to be relatively hard to swing because the cost of putting fresh things onto the board was so high. 

I thought that the game worked well enough, but it overstayed its welcome and really failed to bring anything new to the table. The multiple victory conditions required seemed to take ages to fulfill, and the game seemed to lack much of a story. People's turns often boiled down to: I leave my heroes where they are. I take that stuff because I have a majority there. The builder puts up something, Go. Not too exciting at all.

RATING: 7
This will be my go-to game when someone suggests Settlers or something like it. This feels like Settlers for gamers. No dice, resource production that is probabilistically produced based on the land type, so not exactly predictable, and produced to the space, not to the players. Players get "votes" for the settlements and armies and such and have a simple negotiation process to allocate the resources. Very clever. If you adhere to the no negotiation during allocation rule, it flows pretty fast. Of course people complain about why a certain allocation was suggested, but that's part of the fun. Brilliant mix of cooperation / competition. So much so that it can play completely differently depending on how much players are willing to cooperate vs compete.

Nice game which forces players to cooperate somehow, either to split the wins or even to build something (which never happened in our games..., but then we are kind of alergic to cooperate). Not my cup of te. I did not like the rotating building role. It just slows too much the game. Ending conditions are also kind of frustrating, you never now when is going to end and the game can drag a bit too long for my taste.

Se trata de un juego de construcción al estilo Catán, pero esta vez los recursos no los reciben los jugadores directamente sino los territorios. Esos recursos después se deben repartir entre los jugadores votando propuestas de reparto que realizan los propios jugadores. La interacción entre jugadores es el punto fuerte de este juego, me parece muy interesante ... muchas ganas de repetrir me quedan :)

RATING: 7.5
Rating based upon three games (3,4 & 5 player).   A few quick comments:
Randomness - there is randomness in the resource cards which come out, and which are available on your turn. With no trading or exchange facility, then this can affect your ability to go down a particular expansion route.  
Interaction - the voting for resources was often a foregone thing.  I suspect with repeated plays we would have expanded slightly differently, and seek to build the special buildings more than we did. 
Public works - I build a road (extra resource) card early on in the territory where I had a majority - which I soon lost as other poeple piled in.  Again, with more plays I think we will explore exactly when it is beneficial to do this.  
I personally would have liked slightly bigger boards, and would like some way to indicate when a special building has been built.  The original idea of keeps etc for all players is economically unviable from a cost viewpoint, and I'm now thinking of some sort of coloured or shaped undertile to place beneath the settlement e.g. a grey square for a keep.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I'm not great at negotiation games, and my first try on this had me pinned between two players who stymied me early on. I like the mechanisms, except that it takes a long time for your one chance to build. The game is a lot like Settkers, but harder and longer. We stopped early and I'm not desperate to play it soon.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.8
Played with 4, and all of us enjoyed it.  I think it is interesting that the person who declares himself as victor can't be displaced, others place after him.  Everyone thought I was losing, but I satisfied two of the 3 requirements in one turn and won.  Getting to the mountains is important for stone & gold.  Sharing the resources is clever--be generous at the beginning, then screw everyone at the end in order to build and win.

Have played twice, 4p and 5p.  I like the development of the control-areas-to-produce-resources-to-build-stuff game, especially the resource card piles with the distribution on their backs, but the game doesn't really grab me. I wanted to like it more as it seems an improvement on the base Settler's mechanism. Perhaps it is the wait to build something, the relatively slow growth in resources, and the seeming difficulty to do something about the leader.  Or maybe I'm just not playing very well and not getting to do very much each turn.  Playing the resource availability rule wrong wouldn't have helped (we played you could only have settlement number resources available, when should have been settlement + 1).  Would still try again.

RATING: 5
Components: ok components, houses a bit small but perfect for the board. Sometimes is hard to identify well how many things there are in some tiles
Complex: easy to learn
Weight: medium - light
Players: 4, also good with 3 and 5
Length: around 90 mins
Mechanics: negotiating, this is the main one
Decisions: a lot (where to build, where to move, what should I offer...)
Opinion: funny game, Vikings go on offering and they try to settle the land.
The game goes about your position on the map and the offers you make, and this is a nice mechanic, the active player is the only one to build while the rest are making offers on the different resources.
Nothing new on the building side, beside the Public Works, as you can propose one of these buildings and people can help with the construction. The only issue here is that you can build some special buildings (giving you more heroes and VP) and could be mixed with the standard settlements.
The nice part is on the offering, each turn all tiles with settlements produce one resource card (up to the numbers of houses +1), and each player can make an offer, it's a kind of negotiation, but you have to make the offer and cannot talk about it beforehand. Once done, players vote if they agree (houses 1 vote, your warrior depends on the strength, the priest send warriors to pray so they don't vote, and the bard sings the epics so gains votes depending on other heroes) the offer is distributed, but if don't... is the turn of the next player.
And, more or less, this is the game. Dynamic and lot of thinking what others will do or will they accept the offer (in case you don't win by yourself). And you continue doing this until one player reaches 6 VP or more.... and how you make points? Each player has a secret table saying how they will reach each point, the conditions are the same, but some will have some of the conditions harder and other easier (increasing strength of your warrior, building lot of settlements, building settlements together, building special buildings....)
All in all I like the game, but will play it sporadically, why? because this is one of those games "group depending". If you have the appropriate group to play it, you will enjoy the game, if you have some players on their own business the game will be like a torture (think of one player saying no to you only in Catan, or some players making always the same agreements). This is why my rate is so low, I'd like playing for the joy not for suffering these friendships or enemies

A building game with some novel ideas. It replaces the negotiation from "Catan" with a voting system and borrows the scoring mechanic from "Anno 1503" (fulfill three of five victory conditions). The inclusion of heroes to affect the voting is nice, but their interactions depend on simultaneous action selection to work. Adding the semi-random generation of resources and the voting, the game feels a little too random and chaotic. It's still pleasant to play, but it ends when it starts to get more interesting (at least the basic game, which is the only one I played). My impression is that the victory conditions were set to low values just to reduce the playing time, which even so is a little too long.

Una experiencia distinta. A algunos les recuerda a Catán, aunque no tiene dados ni negociación. Las proposiciones son un aspecto único del juego. Mucha interacción entre jugadores. Combina control de áreas con producción de recursos; cooperación y oposición mezcladas sin que chirríe. Defectos: dado que tu habilidad para conseguir recursos depende de que tus progresos sean más rápidos que los del resto de jugadores, puede haber problemas de “escapadas en solitario”. El tablero es grande y tú sólo controlarás una pequeña parte, siendo difícil intervenir fuera de ahí al tratar de proteger tus recursos.

EDITO: Baja a 7 puntos al compararlo con juegos que estaban en el entorno del 8. Graenaland no me parece tan bueno como estos...

- plays too much like a simulation with many factors to calculate in
- drags a lot, even with 3p - still probably only good with 4 and 5.
- punishes mistakes very hard
- 2/3 of the components look too notch
- 1/3 of the components looks like a prototype

RATING: N/A
First game with 4 players. Nice components and general theme, although the latter is rather irrelevant to the game play itself. I should also point out that some elements of the game seem to be at odds with the history of Norse colonisation of Greenland - from what I know, gold was not found and iron ore in only small quantities, and the settlers did not build roads (they relied on fjords and the sea for travelling between settlements). It is very hard to judge Graenaland after only one play; we played it fairly slowly but it seemed to end suddenly with a clear win for one player (who was in the leading position for most of the game). I suspect that experience and use of the advanced rules will improve the game.

I am not sure about this one.  I give it a 6 because I am sufficiently intrigued to want to play again.  But the general thrust of cooperation in this game leaves our hyper-competitve group scratching our collective heads.  It played very slow for us, but that was at least partially due to the fact that very little investment was made in public infrastructure, and when it was made, it tended to be pallisades.  We clocked in with a solid two hours after rules.  I like several mechanisms, but if it continues to bewilder, it will end up on the trade pile.

JUL 09. Only played one (incomplete) game at ManorCon. I think that as a four player game we had a problem that it quickly became that we had 2 pairs, each vying for the same areas and goods.

Enjoyed it and would play again, but think an odd number may work better, but then that in turn may lead to "kingmaking".

When you read the rules you think that this game is a lot like Settlers.  But while playing I almost never thought of Settlers at all, except for the names of the resource cards.  This is more of a negotiation game.  Very often, players will simply take the cards due to a majority, but the negotiation and relationship building is definitely important.  It seems like it pays to be cooperative to a certain extent.  I'd like to play with the Advanced Rules, as it seems that just about everyone was ready to win in the same turn, perhaps making things a bit too balanced.  I can see how some would be bored with the movement aspect of the game, but I found it interesting and it provided some excitement with some nasty moves.  It seems like a very bad idea to leave one player alone or let one player dominate a certain tile from the beginning.  As long as the game moves quickly, I find it to be very enjoyable.

Update: Seems to last too long and is a little static.  More often than not it's just people trying to dominate in a region, proposing to take everything and then just doing it.  I'm sure it's more nuanced than that, but I don't think I'll be able to get this back to the table to find out.  Traded away.

RATING: 5
This is a combination strategy and influence game with some simultaneous selection and voting. While the game is promising in many ways it probably does not suit my particular preferences in games. My rating is based on one five player game that seemed long for me. Those who don%u2019t mind a bit of semi-predictable chaos while occasionally throwing a bone to create goodwill with neighbours could like this game a lot. The downtime is not excessive because there are usually things to do when it is not your turn to build. I would be willing to play it again - a ringing endorsement from someone who dislikes almost every game that uses the primary mechanic.

My biggest complaint about the game is that it feels like it drags even though gameplay is fairly straightforward and simple.  You can only build when you are the start player and cannot collect resources on your own as the start player.  When you aren't the start player, you collect resources.  A large part of this game is seeking to develop forced partnerships where you can get others to select a region that involves you receiving some of the goods.  Different buildings exist that change up production or effect the game in other ways.  There is some "trading" but it is basically a yes or no proposal and if you don't have majority vote in the region, if the other person(s) say no, you get nothing.  Weird little game...

Based on one play of basic game with 5 players. Took a couple of rounds to catch on. While you can come up resource short as in Catan, it doesn't feel like a dice based or positional death sentence.

Not a bad game but not a particularly good one either.

Since your ability to take a bigger part of the resources depends on that you progress faster than the other players there is a runaway-leader problem. 
The board is also very large. You are only active in a small portion. It's difficult to interveen outside your "homeland" since you have to protect your resource collection.

Initial rating: I guess this really is Vlaada's take on Settlers of Catan.

Has a steeper learning curve thanks to some  original variants on known game mechanics. It's probably more of a gamer's game where you have to "sense" the game in a way. I'd really like to get to know this game better.

Essen ´06- it had to be mine!  First game went pretty well (especially since I won!), but my rating is unstable.  Some things I liked, some not so sure of.  Some strategy there, but hidden victory conditions made it tough to guage your progress.  Our 4-player game saw scores of 6-5-3-2, so two players not really in it at all, and one 'eliminated' very early, and locked out of coming back, not that it bothers me too much.  The game took 2 hours, and any longer would not be good.  Interested to try again.

Never did, and now the game is traded.  Lots of other games I'd rather play with 4.

A great-looking, thematically pleasing letdown.  The fact that only one player can build stuff in each round perpetuates a "Yeah, yeah, c'mon" atmosphere, and the voting for resources often amounts to little more than grabbing everything in a location you dominate.  Worst of all is the scarcity of ore, which is required to build almost everything but villages, which don't bring any new mechanisms into the game.  A real pity.

RATING: 5
First impression (5 players): The game has some merits. I really liked the dividing resources mechanic that isn't a negotiation but simple offer to divide all resources. The other player(s) then must either take or leave as players vote for result and if there is over 50% okey's the resources will be divided. And naturally you might have over 50% by yourself...

That was the best part of the game. Rest is collecting resources and building up towards your victory conditions. You can build "common resources" that increase the amount resources for area but don't add to victory conditions and others might benefit too. This is supposed to be cooperative part of the game but it wasn't used really that much in our game. If some players use those then naturally others should too so they wouldn't be left behind in progress.

The game felt to be too much about moving your hero (in early game) to (be able to) gain resources and then build up stuff. Later it's about moving your hero/priest/bard to max out your resources. 

Five players is too much as you get only every fifth turn to be main player that actually can build stuff. If you miss once your building opportunity your probably out of competition. Four might be best number then as the game needs more than 3 players to be interesting.

Catan with voting. A fiddle to learn, but an interesting blend of resource collection, double-think and diplomacy once you're into the swing of things. The 'pick three of six' victory conditions is a nice idea. The only big problem, given that it's quite long and dry, is finding a group with whom you're going to play it on a regular basis.

RATING: 7.5
A solid design that takes many of the familiar mechanics from Settlers and reshapes them into something that feels fresh and new.  Rolling for resources and trading between players has been replaced with a voting system that is completely different; it generally works quite well - although many times, the voting is a simple "I'll take these" formality because a player has a clear majority in a region.

Very nice components overall, though some of the cardboard seems a little prone to chipping around the edges.

All in all, a very good game.  One final recommendation: Play with the hidden and variable victory conditions.  I think they reduce the 'sameness' of each player's actions and introduce more movement and interaction between the players.

This one is sort of like Settlers, in that you collect resources for the regions in which you have built things and then you can spend those resources to build more things.  There are more choices and more rules than Settlers.  The player aid was not much help; the symbols for actions could have been thought out better or words could have been used.

Anche se è ceko, un german game da manuale: regole semplici, strategie complesse. L'interazione tra giocatori (cooperazione o appropriazione di tutte le risorse) è semplice, così come lo è tutto lo svolgimento del turno di gioco. Molto originale la dichiarazione simultanea degli spostamenti di armate, preti e bardi. Da giocare con le regole avanzate, che prevedono obiettivi personali diversi per tutti. Plauso alla grafica e alla qualità dei componenti (mai visti legnetti così piccoli).

With 5 players the game is (too) long, it takes a long time before you can actually build something. Maybe the optional rule to let one extra player build will change this.

The so-called 'Vlaada game you've never heard of'. You play as one of (up to) five Viking clans trying to colonize Greenland, but through diplomacy. After all, why fight amongst your own peoples? Graenaland is a player-driven negotiation game, that much is true, though it is possibly not negotiation at its finest. Not with titles like Santiago, Chinatown, and more recently, Sidereal Confluence gracing us with their presence. It's not hectic, it's not very free-form, but it is clean and really not all that mean. This may appeal to certain players. Think Catan-style negotiation with some modicum of control. 

You see, while players are free to indicate how they wish to distribute resources in any given land area, the person with the majority votes on a land area gives the final go-ahead (or not) on that decision. So, there is a tangible unit of "agreement" here, that is, the votes. A player may have the opportunity to break a voting tie in favor of one player, and so the player dictating what is to be done with the resources within an area might suggest a mutually-beneficial spread of resources, and win the tiebreaker vote, gaining something in the process (rather than nothing). And gaining something rather than nothing is quite significant in this game, as resources are scarce at the onset. 

As a result, this is a game that plays better at higher player counts, with more zones being accessed, and more buildings developed to increase the amount of resources being produced and transferred among players, and a wider distribution of voting power. The folly of Graenaland is that a player group unwilling to make concessions on votes will stymie the flow of resources and cause the game to drag. Players need to understand cooperation will help this game plod along at a steady pace, and it is a test of skill to know when to begin holding back. A game of chicken, if you will.

RATING: 6
26-01-2014. Rated after 1 play. Graenaland is an interesting game in which you are settlers on Greenland trying to be the best colonist or something. In Graenaland, you try to obtain 3 out of 5 objectives. 

Each round one player is the builder who can build new buildings. This player gets a special resource card that gives 2 resources. The other players can, in the builders turn, each denote one area to divide the resources for. They make one proposal on how to divide the resources. All involved parties can agree or disagree. The number of votes that each player has decides who gets the resources. The number of votes is determined by the amount of buildings you have in an area, the amount of buildings and the overall strength of your heroes. Your Heroes are warriors (strength equal to strength of the army), bards (who are as strong as the number of warriors on the board) or priests who negate all hero values.

Graenaland is an interesting game, but it can be slow. I also wonder if its not too hard to determine who needs what in order to make good divisions. It's interesting, but I am not sure if I like it or not.

--Sept2007-- Pretty cool; the no-negotiation bidding seems a bit cleaner after a play than it had seemed from just reading the rules.  My first play had some of the feeling of the resource acquisition and building flow of Settlers or Keythedral (with more than a little of the acquisition-screwage of that latter title.)  There's a bit of area majority, a bit of custom victory conditions, and a tiny bit of blind bidding (for the leader movement.)  All told, the result is really quite good - though whether it's good enough to demand attention amid a gaggle of quality peers still remains to be seen.  Still, I'm happy to have bought it.

Intriguing game. Slightly fiddly with 5 different card decks, some of them not so easy to differentiate - and it would be helpful to make the buildings a different shape from the settlements - as well as giving the player pieces more distinctive colours. Anyway, that can be fixed with spare parts I already have so I will be getting this to the table again. It's a nice little game - a great example of early Vlaada - an interesting theme, and some well worked mechanics, particularly the simultaneous movement of the "heroes". There's a lot of game in a small box - this could have been given a much more lavish production and sell for twice as much in a larger box, so it's quite a bargain as it stands. Good game.

Graenaland -- Played once; four-player.  Played basic game.  Must play advanced version soon (while rules are still fresh).  I think familiarity with construction costs, familiarity with which ratios apply to each territory type, and use of the advanced victory conditions could make for a more strategic game.

Graenaland takes the Settlers resource-production mechanic and turns it on its ear by adding votes.  It can be quite delicious when a resource-rich territory is hotly contested, and the deciding vote for resource allocation goes to the player with a single token in the territory.  Order can be pivotal, as well.  When the last player to offer a proposal (before the main player can build) gives the main player a chance at a key resource, the main player just may be willing to give that last player quite a deal.

Holy Crap, this game is boring!

Lets look at the first real problem of the game, when it is your turn everyone but you takes their movement.  So it is exceedingly difficult to keep the game moving.  Everyone knows the "oh, crap is it my turn" problem in games, but here no one can properly gauge when your turn is over because you don't do anything on your turn and the next player isn't supposed to do anything.  Hunh?  

Let's keep it going people, I didn't do anything so now it is your turn to wait.

What could actually be interesting about the game is that Vikings get to vote who gets resources, but Vikings will always vote for themselves if it is in their best interest.  There is so much friction in spreading your men out that there is rarely an opportunity to get to the interesting bit of voting for commodities.  Most of the time you stick around in your one or two cards, insuring you have majority collecting cards until one person wins.  It isn't until near the end of the game when people get the opportunity to make interesting votes, and even then they just aren't that interesting.  If you are a player that isn't effected by this you will get farther ahead and will be unstopable. 

Let's not forget the excitement of the secret reveal as players make the tough decision where to move your guy.  What a surprise, everyone stayed where they were.

1 play, Lobster Trap November 3

The "board" is variable size depending on the number of players. It consists of (for us) 9 location tiles; players start out with a hero leader and 2 villages on 2 (of 5) specific tiles. The remaining 4 tiles are empty to start. The tiles are various terrain types. They are arranged in 2 rows (5 - the coast, and 4 - the inner part of the island) slightly offset from each other like the base of a pyramid. This determines movement - you can move to any tile touching you (or 2 tiles distant if using coastal movement). Each turn, you add resources to each tile with any villages on it (each terrain type has a different mix of resources in it's deck; e.g., lots of gold and ore in mountains, lots of wood in forest, etc.). Then, every player [i]except the current player[/i] secretly determines which of their leaders (start with 1 in play; can later build 2 others) will move, and where they will move. All then move their tokens. Then, in turn order, each player [i]except the current player[/i] may make a proposal as to how to split the resources on ONE tile. All players with presence on that tile vote - you get votes based on the #villages there, #buildings, and the hero (each either adds to your voting strength or takes away from others'; you may never have more than one of your own heroes in the same place). If your proposal passes, split accordingly; if it fails, nothing happens. The current player then gets to spend resources. They can build something (another village, or a building - 3 types available, each either bringing one of their other heroes into play or making it easier to strengthen the first hero) using their own resources (there's also a pool of double resources that the current player may select from; 1 card/turn). They may also spend resources to strengthen their army (the first hero in play). Finally, they may propose a single "public work" - buildings that benefit the TILE (e.g., add resources faster) and that other players may contribute resources towards being built. Note that in all cases, Vikings DO NOT NEGOTIATE - proposals are made without preliminary discussion, then votes taken. Your turn is over; repeat clockwise until someone declares they can win - must meet 3 of the 6 possible victory conditions (e.g., have 3 tiles with 2 villages/buildings on them, have 2 of each building type, have 1 tile with 8 tokens on it, etc.). Then, finish the round out - no one else can win ... you're just competing for ranking?!?

We finished the game in 90min. It was OK, but not particularly great. Resources can come up randomly, and there's no trading so you're stuck; once you get behind it is very difficult to catch up. For example, Kevin built a strong army early on, and was able to march it around and take whatever resources he wanted (he ended up winning). Voting at first was "nice" - people were splitting resources even if they had majority control (building good will); later, you pretty much just developed control in an area and took all the resources there. There was little public works building - didn't seem to be much incentive since you couldn't guarantee (unless you were Kevin!) that you'd retain control.

I'd play it again just to be sure, but I think I prefer Settlers - faster, more fun, and more room to catch up (when everyone gangs up on the leader instead of the weakest player).

6/10

A quirky game that works for me.  I like the movement aspect and the negotiations here work better than in most games where the player with the most dominant personality wins out.  It reminds me of Anno 1503 because you are constantly doing something even when it's not your turn, you're building with combination of resources, and you need to fulfill three of five victory conditions.  It took a little while to understand some of the nuances of the rules, so my rating could climb.  It seems like a game that required a good amount of inventiveness in order to make all the mechanics interrelate so well.  I can see the game dragging a bit timewise with the wrong players, but our group played at a relatively quick pace.

This game is unique and while ***vaguely*** similar to settlers in that it is "expand and settle and build with resources collected," it is a better game.  Gone is the annoying luck of the dice, in is some brilliant negotiation replacing the silly trading of resources which in Settlers stalls at the end-game.Great game!

I sold, because really it needs exactly 5 players to truly shine, and at that time the money was more important than the game with such precise requirements.  But I still think it is absolutely fantastic!

A game of settlement and settlement expansion somewhat similar to Settlers of Catan.  Very nice looking components with good artwork.  It took a while to get to grips with some of the slightly unusual rule dynamics but once we got the hang of it play moved relatively quickly.  Lots of different chioces can be made during a turn, but considerable preparation is needed prior to your turn because building is limited to your turn only while resource collection happens every turn.   I found some of the choices to be too confusing (annoying?) but apart from that I think it is a good game.  Would happily play it again.

The game seems to run a little long, but does some interesting things. I like the idea of proposing deals and doing public works but it seemed in our game as though most deals were pre-determined as players tended to ensure they dominated in a region so that they didn't have to 'negotiate'.

The game also seemed to run a little long, but there is a chance this is because it was our first play.

In many ways, Graenaland feels like Settlers of Catan with a Viking attitude. You're turning in resources to build a la Settlers, but you really need to plan where those resources are going to come from rather than simply rolling the dice well as in Catan. To be honest, the theme and mechanics aren't necessarily a great match - at no point to you ever feel like a Viking raider or settler - but the game is challenging and offers multiple paths to victory for players. For me, Graenaland was a pleasant surprise and, while not one of by best-loved games, fills a unique niche in my collection.

My first Vlaada Chvatil game. On paper it reminds me of Europa 1945-2030 in that you want area majorities, but in the absence of such, voting coalitions determine the result. In Graenaland at stake is the division of produced resources.

What's interesting is that you want to improve the land so it will produce more stuff, but you have to be aware that others could move in afterwards and deny you the yield.

I'm also impressed at how much thematic sense I see in all the little rules. The things you can build often require intuitively sensible resources, and behave in reasonable ways. A stronger army needs food. Forests produce a lot of wood. If you build a fence in a territory, players get less say from marching their army in without any settlements.

...The game does take awhile to play and there's potential for AP (look at my cards, look at all the things I could buy, take into account methods of substituting one good for another when paying) but the game really gives me a "just one more turn" feeling where I want to see what will happen next. And you probably have a choice of multiple interesting things to spend your cards on, all of which would be of some use, and all of which are different in effect.

Another interesting thing is that someone may invade another's territory to break their monopoly on it, and that's aggressive, but may actually cause them to start cooperating for mutual benefit. Since each player can propose distribution of goods from only one territory per turn, if two players are eligible to get goods in multiple territories, they can effectively negotiate an overall split.

...I'll up this to a 9. It's roughly what I want from a game. I particularly like the decision of what stuff to build with your resources. I think that, as with Through the Ages, you may not be deciding what to do so much as in what order to do it, and frequently that decision seems like it matters.

It's okay with 3, but with 4 and 5 the gameplay struck us all as unique and surprising. The proposal system, both for public works and for splitting resources, led to some interesting decisions all around, and it encouraged both specialization and being spread out. I look forward to playing again, it's a neat system!

My main criticism so far is the unlimited hand size - you can just lurk behind and then spring to victory out of nowhere. I'm also a bit unclear as to the end-game from the rules in the advanced version.

There is a nice resource/building game in here, but the length seems a little long for what it is.  It doesn't help that one player won without anyone else being close (we were playing with the secret goals).  I talked to some players who warmed up to it considerably after additional plays, so perhaps I am missing something.

Kind of fun, but played a bit slow with 5.  I think it would be better for 4.  Also, I can't tell yet, but it almost seems like the game plays you a little bit.  I'd like to try a game with 4 with the variable victory conditions.

Played again - still too slow with 4.  The mechanics just aren't different enough to merit the extra time.  Also, the advanced victory point cards seem like the aren't really even.  

All in all, an ok game, but in a huge universe of games, doesn't need to stay in the collection.

Read the pretty long rules and you have the impression of a very clever and interesting mechanics. Probably it is really a good interesting mechanic. BUT... the game is soooo slow.

This game reminded those who played it of settlers of catan.  The group however thought this game was better because you had more control over what resources you received and thus weren't at the mercy of good/bad die rolls.  Overall I thought it was neat, and I would like to try some different strategies.

Played a prototype once (the actual game might differ). It had some interesting ideas and a nice gameplay, even though some of the choices seemed unlikely to be ever made by the players (we might have played some rules wrong). I am curious to see if there have been any changes, and eager to play it again.

whew... this company is really producing some of my favorite games.  Now this one doesn't strike the same chords as Through the Ages, or Prophecy, but dang if it isn't a good ride.  I'm not usually one to like negotiating games, but Graenaland keeps that in check with a few clever rules.  It has good setting, and is not too long.  The victory condition are variable, and in our 5 player game, everyone was "in it" until the final turn.  nice.  another note after a three player game.  we ended up in the same situation as the first game... all the players ready to win at the same time.  i'm not so sure that's a great thing.  but the advanced rules sounds better.

Graenaland is another good example of a conflicting design.  It attempts to encourage cooperation through the use of public works, improvements to the land that can benefit everyone that has settled there.  However, it also pits players against each other in the distribution of the resources by a voting system.  Which then begs the question, why would I build something that another person can just turn around and use to deprive me of the items I need?

Furthermore, Graenaland has possibly the worst kind of negotiation aspect I've seen implemented.  The proposal mechanic is completely anticlimactic and serves to slow down the process.  The only interesting thing to it is how the different type of heroes can affect the votes.  However, that alone isn't quite enough to make up for the awful gameplay.

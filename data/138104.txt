Man this game had potential.  When I first played a demo, thought it was the deck builder I always wanted because it has combat! 

Turns out, the full game is slow and clunky.  2 resource types is difficult to manage.  Lots of down time.  Factions are very similar, especially across Hordes/Warmachine.  And the text is SO SMALL.

Just not a great game.

An interesting take on deckbuilding.  I like that you build from you own customized reserves deck, the options available for the order phase (purchase, deploy or rush) and the concept of Warcasters.  The artwork on the cards is top-notch.  Features direct conflict with other players. The one downfall in my mind is perhaps the over-simplified battle system.

RATING: 6.5
Such high hopes for this game, but there are just a few too many issues.  There are a lot of cases where there really is no reason to every get into a conflict with other players, and indeed, plenty of decks can win without interacting with another player at all.  There are variants that seem to make the game more enjoyable... but why weren't they made official to save this game?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
A polarizing game, but I ended up really enjoying this as a mash-up of deck building and deck customization, in which the theme really shines if you'll just let it. You are competing over various locations to score them by placing troops, many of which will have individual powers and variables. Choosing different Warcasters each game and different colored detachments allows for a slightly altered experience each time, and with so many expansions out you've got a lot of variation awaiting. Think of it as Dominion meets Smash Up with the Warmachine theme...love the universe and really liked playing this, in fact I think I might dig this one more than the Hordes version ever so slightly, if only because I like the factions more.

RATING: 6
A pretty fun deck building game - where you build from card pools entirely separate from the opponents, but interact with them in 'battles' over locations.

The art is really nice, which adds to the atmosphere of the game.

The only issue is that because each faction is asymmetric, I'm not sure that each side is actually balanced - Protectorate never wins in my games.

As time goes on, found the game isn't as fun as an LCG.  The point of deck builders is not having to build decks before playing

RATING: 9
There's something about this game that keeps drawing me back. The theme is slightly off the beaten path -- a techno-fantasy world war with unique and interesting factions -- and the gameplay is a fresh take on a prolific genre. This is not just another deckbuilder; you won't find yourself looking at your hand and just buying the best card you can afford. There's multiple viable options, and some painstaking decisions to be made as you struggle for control of locations and victory points. It also stands out for being a head-to-head card game that plays well solo, as hidden information is not part of the strategy. [b]Warmachine High Command[/b] is a good choice if you're only going to buy one game in this series -- it's a balanced mix of the elements that make this world intriguing -- but get the other games if you find yourself enjoying it. Love it!

I rated this game a 6.5, back in 2013, and playing it again in 2017 I see why.  I remember enjoying it a lot more.  It's certainly a really fun game, and some nice unique elements, but it falls down for the same reason Smash Up falls down... it takes too long for what it is.  Too much take that and back and forth, and just waiting for the one opportunity to break through just enough to steal some points.  I also remember Jeff talking about taking time to create your main deck... but I don't want to spend that much time on this game, and if I do then I should find others who spend that much time on their decks...  I like Drafting, and this sort of deck building, but not to the detriment of actually getting to play the game.  It's why I hate how long it takes the kids to created their decks for Dicemasters.

Here's my initial assessment from 2013 (after a 105 minute game....) "Not too bad of a game. Another though where it pays to know the cards inside out, and what your sets should be. Which, for me means that once your opponent has played it a few more times than you they will have the set they want to have, and constructed their private reserve exactly how they think will be a winning combo each time. That kind of thing just makes for a boring game for me. I don;t want to take time learning a whole bunch of cards. I am fine with Dominare and Seasons, because I see a card and I just go with it. If I played Seasons with someone that had memorized the ULTIMATE combos... then not so much though. "

Glad I have it, and will play it... I just don't want to take forever playing a game like this.

Nice deckbuilding game with beautiful cards.
The "Wind of War" cards change every turn of the game and they also function as a timer (game ends after 10 - 14 turns).
+ I like that troups conquering a location are lost for the rest of the game (you don't loose their VPs). So a player gaining many locations does not run away as he looses his strong units.
+ I also like that you can optimize your deck every time when you shuffle your discard pile to make a new draw pile (always when your draw pile is empty and you have to draw a card you may choose one card to be out of game for the rest of the game).
- After 4 games it seems that collecting VP-cards gains more VP as fighting for locations. We try testing the game with changed rules (draw 7 cards, you may keep 2 cards). If this doesn't work :-(

I had really low expectations going in.  I play the miniatures game, but didn't really care about the card game coming out.  When it was released and I saw it on the shelf at the store, I decided to give it a try and bought it.  Over the next several weeks, I played it multiple times, with different player counts, all with people who are familiar with the minis game.  This game fell flat each and every time.  There are so many other games that are similar to this that I would rather be playing (Nightfall comes to mind).  Luckily the game store where I purchased it from bought it back from me, so it is no longer in my collection.

I have heard that the game gets much better when you add in all of the expansions.  I could probably be talked into playing it under those circumstances, as I am curious, and I like the Warmachine franchise, but I'm not spending any of my money on this game again.

RATING: 7
I've tried this game quite a few times now with the basic set and I feel that it is quite decent - ideally I'd give it a 6.5 but that is not possible.

Having tried 2-player, 3-player and 4-player, I think the game works as a 2-player game, although Khador has a definite advantage there which sometimes messes the balance up - if Khador draws many good resource cards early into his reserves, he can be impossible to stop. The 3/4 player game works well - as long as you count VPs. This is mainly because Khador has such ease of gathering VPs from its bought cards, the other players need to be aware of when the Khador player is bunkering up and just buying cards. When they see this happening, they need to get on the ball and cooperate on refusing Khador to gain locations. Usually, this leads to a crushing defeat for the Khador player, so he needs to play smart and lay low in the early game, only speeding up later.

When these caveats are in place, it is a good, fun game that matches my enjoyment of most other LCGs I have played. Having distinctive factions in the game is quite a challenge, however, and later expansions need to remove the too large edge Khador (and Skorne in Hordes HC) has in the VP department.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
An interesting mix of deck building and location control (reminiscent of taking bases in Smash Up). It is more intuitive and easier to play than it looks at first glance, although the cards could be better differentiated. It also helps that I love the steampunk mech-warrior -- named "Warjacks" here -- theme.

RATING: 5
We feel very...ambivalent about this game. Ambivalent is really the only way to describe it. Sometimes we're very turned on to the theme and uniqueness of it. Other times...well, other times we feel like the factions need rebalancing and the game could have spent another few months in playtesting.

We do plan on picking up some of the campaign expansions, when they are released, to see if that alters or improves the experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I feel like the worst thing this game did was stand around and accept accusations of being a deckbuilding game. If you go into it with just a core box, you're likely to be disappointed. No, this game used the LCG model for a reason; once you wrap your head around the concept of building an optimized Reinforcements deck, it all falls into place. The "why do i have to pay for a dude twice?" should be "I have to pay for this guy every time he dies, so i need to be cautious with how I use him". Having those extra cards from the boosters is very important. It gave false pretenses while doing a lot of good things.

One of the first deck builders I ever played, or at least that I remember. It's an interesting game, focused on gaining victory points rather than defeating your opponent in a straight fight.

It's an easy-to-play, hard-to-master deck builder. Pretty decent, imo, though its basic mechanics probably will not catch your interest immediately. But after a few play, escpecially with some expansions, it starts to show its merits, the real differences between factions' mechanics, its customization potential, and the intentions behind some mechanics which might even be seen as "bleh" at first sight. I can recommend it, it's a fast paced, fun deck builder with a plenty of replayability. (I've never played it in multiplayer, only in 1-on-1. It is fun in solo play as well.)

Very strategic & tactical deck-builder, with unique feel: personal drafting deck, fighting over locations (Smash Up-style), highly customised decks, discarding cards to shuffle your discrad pile, and so on - this is not your run-of-the-mill deck-builder, for sure! It takes a while to master it and you do need to study every single type of card and learn what it does and the sinergy between the army decks, but it's well worth! A deck-builder that that raises a real challenge!

Somehow this game manages to be both too long and too short - it starts very slowly and yet seems to end before the gameplay gets anywhere interesting.

Not entirely sure I agree with those comments regarding buying units rather than taking locations: locations are always worth much more than any unit. I was disappointed in the combat resolution, though, as many here do state. 

But I do rate this game highly. I love the Warmachine/Hordes universe and the cards and artwork are top notch and as flavorful as possible given the mechanics. I really like the Warcaster implentation as well. When I played with a highly competitive opponent, the game was much more tense than the mechanics would suggest. Ultimately, the game feels more like a resource management game than a wargame, as you try to maximize your purchasing power each turn...then fight where possible. So a bit more euro-ish than I was hoping for. Would probably rate this a "7", but it gets an extra point from me for the theme.

The rating is based on very few games, so it will change.

I have so far only played it with 4 players, and that doesn't work too well. It takes a little too long, and there's the old problem, that when two players fight each other it's to the benefit of everybody else. So staying out of fights becomes a good way to win - or rather, let everybody else loose.

But I really like the Warmachine/Hordes universe.

This game is probably one of the most entertaining deck building games I have played. The wife picked it up at GenCon this past year while I was working and promptly proceeded to play it for 12 hours strait. By the time I was actually able to get a game in she was a master. We probably play the game 2 or 3 times a week.

Ordered like new from BGG auction. Not sure how I feel about this yet.  I like the cards and the mechanics, but seems awfully hard to take locations, which is the basis of scoring points.

With four different factions there it lots of replayability here.

RATING: 1
Totally derivative design, ripping off Dominion, Omen: A Reign of War, Blue Moon et al (wonder if the similarity in combat for latter two + this is due to a combined lineage, perhaps to Magic?). Deckbuilding is card-text-intensive enough without applying that humongous overwhelming 'deckchoosing' setup step that Omen has.

3-player just didn't work at all. There are way too many turtle options in here, starting with the WARCASTERS that are supposed to be so amazing. Amazing at prolonging the game and making it more painful, yes. We got VPs only because we bought armies and kinda implicitly agreed to stop attacking whoever had units on board and only the player to the left. That's how b0rked it was.

No ways to rig deck/hand intelligently.

Far better things in gaming to enjoy than another derivative deckbuilder. We had worker placement in the 2000s, welcome to the spate of deckbuilding in the 2010s.

RATING: 5.5
Strange combination of deck construction (as in Magic: the Gathering) and deck building (as in Dominion). Each player chooses a faction and takes three of its six detachments, which form a private draw deck. Four cards are turned face up as a buy pool for that player -- think Ascension or Star Realms, but with each player having a separate row to choose from. Most cards provide resources to purchase more cards and attack/defense abilities used to contest locations, worth victory points.

Combat is a simplistic matter of adding up unit strengths on each side of a location and picking enemies to remove (if the total power is enough to kill any). The important part is that capturing a location requires a majority by two [i]at the start of your turn[/i], so locations must be held in the face of opposition; in practice this tends to require overwhelming force.

As the winner's units only are moved out of the game to their "occupying forces" pile, the use of said overwhelming force means that it is not longer available.

It's an interesting hybrid that brings together features from several well-regarded children of Magic: the Gathering, but I'm not sure it really works. The private draw piles increase player differentiation at the cost of some interaction and with significant additional up-front complexity. (Less than in a deck construction game, of course, but substantially more than in a normal deckbuilder.)

The decks in the base game (both War Machine and Hordes sets) are very light on card and tempo control, so there's much less in the way of engine and combo building than is typical. There's also very little deck thinning. The result is that it's not really an engine/snowball game: it seems to ramp up in the early game and then stay flat, rather than accelerating to a crescendo. This isn't helped by the catchup mechanism of the occupying forces and the comparative ease of blocking locations, which slows everything right down.

A special bit of hate has to go out to the winds of war events, which add significant and unnecessary randomness, including a variable end-game trigger.

It's not terrible, but like every other Privateer Press board/card game I've played it just comes off half-baked.

Very decent, underrated game.  Probably should have been a CCG with a better expandable game play mechanism.

A deck builder with some pregame deck building. I really enjoyed how this played out and would like to play more but unfortunately no one else has be interested in playing.

Curious. I'm a Warmachine fan, but I have an awful lot of deckbuilders. Having announced an expansion and not putting my faction in it isn't doing wonders for wanting to put it on my short list.
Hey PP, Mercs would be nice, but Retribution would be awesome.

I love the Iron Kingdoms setting, so this game appeals to me on that level, and my son and I enjoy the mechanics as well.  (We haven't played many deckbuilding games so some of this - such as discarding cards for later use - is novel to us.)

Warmachine: High Command gets a few things right and a whole lot wrong — mainly, that it isn't any fun.

Sadly combat results in no player getting any locations as you are not able to hold on to them until the start of your next turn. So the best strategy is to just buy units that are worth victory points. Avoid.This.Game.

I've been on the fence with this one. Tried a solo game today to learn the rules. It feels like a super good version of Battle Lines with deck building added on to it. I like some of the mechanics very much. Looking forward to playing this for real.

Thematic deck builder. I liked it more than dominion, but far less than Legendary.

A lack luster bidding game with a bit of limited deck building and a coat of war machine paint. The card interaction are fairly shallow and you don't have much opportunity to design any real interesting strategy into your deck. Also Though i'm not super familiar with the universe the cards didn't seem very thematically different from each other either. This made every faction I played seem pretty similar to me. The warcasters which are basically one time use trumps felt pretty good but are not enough to save the game. Easily the biggest disappointment of Gencon 2013. Fans of fantasy combat and building building/card games in general would be served better looking to rune age.

A very cool deckbuilder that combines some familiar mechanics with a few new ideas to keep the game feeling fresh.  It also doesn't hurt that it has (arguably) the finest card art of any deckbuilder to date.

Steam punk Iron Kingdom war engagement deck builder.  Faction warcaster determines starting deck build. Winds of war deck adds a game play condition to each round. Spend command and war points to claim units and occupy locations. Good decision moments for when and which cards leave your deck to battle for locations. Great artwork.

Deck builder game where each player can build there own store kind of. Interesting concept, but just doesn't end up being as good as the many other deck builders out there.

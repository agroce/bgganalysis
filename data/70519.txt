RATING: N/A
This is the only "war" game I own, and although it abstracts the English Civil war way down it is still good game. I really feel the history in this game. All of the event cards tell you exactly what important event happened on a certain day in the war, as well as other things to do with religious struggles and riots and things of that sort. All of this is great but man is it a difficult game. Ideally a solo game should be at least a little difficult or else you would have little incentive to play it often but to some degree in my opinion it is a little too difficult. If it really was this hard for the Parliament to beat Charles than boy did they get lucky, because that is the only way I even barely survive is extremely lucky dice rolling.

As far as solitaire designs are concerned, I was incredibly impressed with some of VPG's offerings, namely Nemo's War and Disaster on Everest (Darkest Night, not so much, but that remains to be seen).

Cruel Necessity is a very interesting design, filled with tension, some history (not that the game is educational, but that it PRODS one to seek education -- which is the way it should be), and no small degree of difficult decisions.

This one probably won't be leaving the collection anytime soon, if ever.

Fantastic siege style game about the English Civil War. Too much to think about each turn and never enough time to satisfy the demands of religion, politics, war, foreign invaders and historic achievements. Fun, abstracted battle system with historic events that are able to turn the tide. Some wonderful flavour text and brilliant ideas make this a keeper. But Not for me.

Enjoyable SoS game but there are so many tracks it is ridiculous. Also there are a huge number of battles that are very time consuming to resolve, and extremely random. It makes the game drag a bit which is a shame, because it is a great theme and great art (also the rulebook is hilarious).

Excellent solitaire game.
A upgrade of the States of Siege system.

Absorbent and thematic components (Map, event/action cards, tiles/counters, rulebook).
I like the fact that the system allows the player to take some critical decisions without the need of the infamous and repetitious die rolls (Fortifying and Zeal commitment) wich improves greatly the gameplay and a feeling of better control. 
VPG had the common sense of divide the game in three smaller scenarios representing each of the EC wars.
Each can be played in a reasonable period of time (40-60 minutes).
I will upgrade my rating when I discover how to coordinate the acquisition of achievements with the military - political situation on the map.
By now, overall, very very good.

I don't know a lot about the history of the subject, but I have a lot of fun playing the game.  It is State of Siege on steroids.  The tactical battle map, achievement cards, push-pull political meters, and fortresses make for an innovative system with tons of difficult decisions.

Both simple (well if you've played Ottoman Sunset/Hapsburg Eclipse) and complicated. Solo mechanisms run easily - although I recommend the rule summary in the download section here.  But so many decisions to make, so much possible alternative strategies and so much can be on a knife edge.  So far I've managed a moderate and marginal victory and a marginal defeat - the first victory may not have happened had I read the rules properly.  My main complaint as the Puritan Godly is the dice must be made by Irish Catholics - how else to explain needing to roll a 3 and rolling five straight 1's and one 2!!

Picked this one up after watching it on Box of Delights. I love the historic nature of the game. You get to learn about the British Civil War as you play the game. But you are just constantly rolling dice. And if you roll badly (like I tend to do) you are not going to do well. There is very little you can do to mitigate the dice so the game just sort of beats you down round after round if you roll poorly (did I mention dice tend to hate me?). But it is an educational game and the graphic design is some of Victory Point Games's best.

RATING: 7
Interesting game and a tough nut to crack.

After a few plays, it still seems really difficult to win, but I'm starting to envision possible survival strategies. 

The defense of the realm alone seems hard enough, and acquiring a couple of achievements along the way is almost too hard. But the challenge to try to pull it off is making me want to come back to this game again and again.
My initial results were: -7pts. ; -6pts. ; +1pt. ; +5pts.
So, I guess I can hope to win someday. 

It is pretty luck driven, bad rolls will make you lose whole turns and get you really pissed. But after so many rolls, it tends to wash out.

I like the way battles are handled, but I'd be glad to get more bonuses for when you win them.

All in all, a satisfactory solitaire experience. But one with a pretty steep learning curve.

Cruel Necessity has a card-driven system where the board state changes upon flipping a card. You are then allowed to take a number of actions to mitigate the board state, plan for the future, etc., and the success of those actions is determined by dice rolls. 

Cruel Necessity, despite individual action's success being tied to a dice roll, allows you to plan for the short-term and the long-term. Add in the achievements, which provide another layer of strategic and tactical decision-making, and you have a game that is quite compelling. Further add in the historical context on each card and you have a compelling game that is fun to play.

I expected the battle mat to be a bit more impactful on the outcome of the battles. For the first deck, an individual battle can be summarized as a tactical dice roll. That said, however, the probability of winning does get weighted throughout the three deck game, and the battle map also helps inject quite a bit to the thematic flavor into the game. On balance, the battle mat is a welcome addition to the game.

There are a number minor issues with the production, but that's to be expected with a split paper mat. The rule books printing quality is not good, but the rule book itself is well done. There are, however, a couple instances of inconsistent terminology in the rule book.

Edit, July 2017: Is it weird that despite my opinion that Dawn of the Zeds is the better overall game that this game gets more play? Cruel Necessity, in my opinion, wins on set-up time, cohesion of rule set and attractiveness of theme.

Edit, Sept 2017: This game remains my touchstone for States of Siege games. It satisfies and sticks with me every time I play it.

A cool system with good components (for a change?!).  I had no problems with the burnt counters.  Because I am biased toward the Royalist side, I wish there was a way to solo it, or to have a two-player game.

-------------------------------------------------------

Cruel necessity could sum up how I feel about buying VG products.  I have been disappointed with almost every purchase.  Either the game has components that are too cheap, while the price is too high--VG's price is almost always too high--or the game is just a lemon that no other game company would touch.  Perhaps this game will be the exception.  Because of my interest in the ECW, I want to make it so.

I am a sucker for immersive, thematic solitaire games. This game basically taught me the history of the English civil wars. At its heart, it is a super simple States of Siege game where enemies are marching towards you from 4 points. However, this game takes that simple mechanism and pushes it to another level. There are fortresses that can be fortified (or attacked), armies can be disordered, random bad things pop up that have to be maintained. The track system is also a stroke of genius. You must balance 6 different tracks (by using actions) to score positive points at the end of the game, if you make it that far. Ohhh, and did I mention the combat? Definitely random, but there are enough choices to make this incredibly fun. I will be playing this again real soon.

What a great solitaire game...and my favorite of the VPG "States of Siege" series.  This may have fired the Ottoman Sunset/Hapsburg Eclipse combo.  Those are good as well, but this one just has more "meat" on the bones and more meaningful decision-making opportunities.

A somewhat interesting solo game where the player tries to fend off the ever pressing armies and ideals of their virtual opponent. The theme is very nicely implemented, but the gameplay drags a bit for me and becomes somewhat repetitive. The battles are interesting at first, but they are very often a draw and the payoff for the setup and implementation of these battles just doesn't feel balanced. I really like the idea of trying to manage the track sand armies with limited resources, but overall I found the game to be just ok. A decent solitaire experience, but nothing I am itching to play.

Fascinating history.  Not just a war game.  The politics adds a frustratingly historical component.  I like the battle format, the action points (zeal points), and flavor text.  But this game is viciously hard.  The achievement cards are incredibly hard to obtain.  You feel like you're being crushed. It seems incredibly luck dependent to move the political tracks.  Several battles should have been great victories only to roll horribly.  Is this game too luck dependent?  We will see.  While I very much like this game. I don't know if it will have staying power because of the overwhelming luck and that hopelessness of victory..

If Soviet Dawn is like juggling, this is like juggling while keeping plates spinning, while navigating a minefield. The engine is complex, with multiple armies, multiple tracks, and multiple ways of getting beaten. Event cards and Accomplishments give a good sense of history, and key aspects of the geography of the conflict are neatly modelled. Although generally battle boards are fun in principle but a pain in practice, the one here works, capturing the flavour of ECW battles in a quick and simple way. Fun, challenging and flavoursome, the lower rating just reflects the fact that it lacks a little of the elegance of the simpler game, and is so involved that you just don't get that 'just one more go' feel. But VPG again hits the target

After few play-throughs, I am still not excited about playing this game.
I think it's more of a complex puzzle, than a game, like I have to find a way to win it and then get a bit lucky too.
To me feeling like I am there is very important, and this one just does not do it.
The battle system is tedious and time consuming, I started playing with quick battles and found them to be a lot better.

Cruel Necessity is the current pinnacle of the VPG States of Siege wargame series. Incorporating a battle board mechanic for some of the major battles of the ECW gives the game extra depth. The number of elements that need to be dealt with provides the player with difficult decisions to make nearly every turn.  These elements come together and interact beautifully as a whole to create a very challenging but engagingly fun SoS game. An added bonus is the opportunity to learn more about this fascinating period in British history.

RATING: 9
The most complex States of Siege (SoS) game I have played to date.  If you are interested in this one, I suggest getting a simpler one first, learning the mechanisms, then moving into this one with it's flair.  

The game - I love it, the battles map is awesome and I love earning or losing Zeal points.  Speaking of Zeal points, this game offers a plethora (for war gamers) of options for what to use those zeal points on, lots of variety which adds some nice flavor to the game from the more vanilla SoS games.  Finally, I like the six different political/religious/country tracks.  The game has tons of options and even the historical flavor text on the cards are well done. The only negative I have for this game is that it definitely takes longer than 60 minutes to play.  Set-up is fast once you have done it once (grab a GMT counter tray, it works great for this one) as the starting conditions are all marked on the board. A full game (completion of the 60 cards) should take on the order of 2 hours.  I played with the cards in numerical order (following the historical timeline) and it was a blast.

I won with +18 (1 less than what happened, but enough for the win).
-Only rule I missed was that after drawing a political achievement card you do NOT perform actions (thus I did about 40-50 actions).  I accidentally cheated big time, so this game is NOT easy to win, and I can't ever imagine winning with +30 VP.

GREAT SOLO GAME

A States of Siege solitaire game themed on the English Civil War.  You are the Parliament forces, and are trying to keep the military and political enemies at bay as you work through a deck of cards.

Lovely looking game, produced in the latest Victory Point style, with sturdy box, laser cut pieces and slip case.  The game play is meaty and interesting, but not overwhelming.  The event deck is broken into three phases of the war, allowing for shorter scenarios to be played.  The battle map is an interesting diversion, and fun to play out.  I especially liked the opposing tracks (Ireland/Scotland, Monarchy/Parliament, etc) and their consequences for gaining achievement cards.

All in all, very solid, and probably my favorite States of Siege game.  Very good.

Acquired via Geektrade (for Vanished Planet) February 2017.  This is a very interesting take on the English civil wars of the mid-1600's.  It requires lots of juggling between military, political, and religious goals.  It reminds me strongly of the COIN series of card-driven games, and is fun to play.

 A good addition to the states of siege solo games. More complex than its peers, and most of this complexity is invested in the historical story rather than tactical decision making. If you are interested in the topic and solo games seek it out. Like all states of siege games however be aware that good die rolls are as, if not more important than your decisions in determining success.

I thought it was a mistake after the first play. Just rolling single die for single action. Then I discovered another levels of the game and it is exciting historical ride.

My first SoS game. It's a good game but I have no desire to get other SoS games.
It feels much more like a Euro with dice than a wargame to me (to be fair the developer states that it is not meant to be a "highly accurate simulation").
The best idea are probably the achievements. The battles get a bit tedious, especially in the beginning where you hardly have a chance to win (there is the quick battle resolution variant of course - but then you miss the fun of killing Prince Rupert). Placing your named units in the tactical battle is a no-brainer (if you were to place your named units after the royal random placement, there was at least a little bit of tactics) and there is no point in not using your named units for every battle, as chances that they get killed is rather slim. And what else are they good for, if not for fighting.

The "AI" is limited to moving tracks up and down in a random way without regard to the actual situation (the "map" really consists of another four 1-dimensional tracks). It doesn't compare to a reactive AI, like in Butterfield solitaire games for example. The "AI" in CN only acts, but never *reacts* to the players input. The later being the benchmark for a great solitaire game to me. In fact there is no AI at all, as this would imply some kind of conditional execution. There are no such conditions in CN, there is just a (randomized)sequence of manipulating the tracks (as I said, I also consider the royal armies as markers on tracks moving back and forth) by the instructions on the event cards.
In the end it's a racing game on a treadmill represented by the sequence of cards.
Seems like all SoS games work this way.

The events on the cards are not intertwined at all and feel rather repetitious and generic. I have a hard time, seeing a "story" develop. I am missing more interrelation between achievements, political tracks, tactical battles and events. Something like conditional events depending on the state of the tracks, for example.

It's still quite entertaining and I will surely keep it and play it from time to time.

Ended up trading this.

----

Thinking on this some more: it was neat to go through the battle subsystem the first time, but it really doesn't provide for enough choices for the number of steps required. Some kind of "tactical" choices would be nice.

-----

A preliminary rating. I've only played once, but it didn't feel especially interactive and, even with me playing at a fairly fast clip, it took longer than it felt like it should for the amount and quality of decisions I got to make. The quality of decisions is probably what I'm most suspicious of at this point: it seemed like I was faced with either obvious choices or arbitrary ones, and there didn't seem to be enough complexity/synergy among the various tracks.

I'll definitely give it another go at some point to see if something that I'm missing jumps out at me

One play so far - a loss during the Second Civil War.  

My initial reaction is that this is an incredibly immersive game that is going to need some time and many plays to really get to know its intricacies well.  I haven't felt this way about a game since Navajo Wars.

Second game completed.  Made it through all three civil wars, finishing with a Marginal Defeat score of +4.  Didn't buy enough Achievement Cards, but damn, when any of the top three tracks fall near F, it's hard to get them back up.  

After two games, I cannot praise this game enough.  This is the best solitaire game design I have seen yet.  It's very difficult, the theme is engrossing, and the gameplay is tight.  The dice are frustrating when they don't roll your way, but I think that adds to the game.  A perfect 10 rating.

I haven't even bothered with the scenarios.  My second Campaign Game went through the full deck and took under 2.5 hours - a reasonable amount of time that flew by. 

Finished a second Campaign.  This game feels more brilliant now.  I like the "constant struggle" feel, and the game feels perfectly play tested.

I was a playtester. Cruel Necessity is an ambitious attempt to add many dimensions to the tried and true "State of Siege" structure. It is a complete success on almost every level.

Dimension 1: The Campaign arena. At first glance, the map offers fewer "spokes" to the SOS "wheel" than normal -- looks can be deceiving. Each front has additional nuance, and almost a "3D" feel. Fortresses, Revolts, battle results, micro-and macro Politics, and Economics are all modeled with great elegance -- layered on seamlessly to the basic format. 

Dimension 2: The Political track. "Off-board" Tracks have been utilized before -- but never have they been so integrated together, with their own unique "topography". Every part of every track has its own "raison detre" and must be "massaged" to achieve optimum results.

Dimension 3: Achievements. This is a totally unique game element. On the surface, it is attempt to model long-term "paradigm shifts" to England's political future. At first I resisted this dimension, and stubbornly found ways to win "in spite" of these distracting Achievements. Eventually, both the game (and me) evolved, and I see Achievements as much more than chrome -- but another rich gaming dimension, that has a wide variety of strategic options. 

Dimension 4: Tactical battles. Never has a "State of Siege" game attempted to fight out individual battles. The system is clean, and very popular. Personally, I find it is something that is "experienced", rather than driven by my decision making, so I can't rave about this dimension. But Cruel necessity offers an optional quick way to resolve battles as well, so there really is no down-side to this dimension.

Non game-play dimensions: This isn't make or break for me -- but I would be remiss if I didn't mention that the components are excellent (the Fortress concept was instantly grafted on to my next game design), and the level of historical research surpasses John Welch's usual stellar performance. I have been a military historian for 40 years, and my knowledge of the era tripled (at least), just by perusing the game.

Quibbles: There is a lack of "death tension". Cruel Necessity models history almost too well, in that careful players will always make it to the end. There are few heart-stopping "near death" experiences. Doesn't mean you automatically win the game -- just that you won't lose till the end. Compensating however, is that there are innumerable "monkey-wrenches" that can foil your carefully laid plans. 

Cruel necessity offers far more "Action points" than any other SOS game (giving players more control), but the bewildering array of options make this a very deep game to play. There are very distinct personal "styles" that can be seen -- each with their own pluses and minuses (after 20+ games, my approach is very successful in winning, but I have never won a Decisive victory, nor will I ever).

I only lightly playtested the Scenarios -- the Campaign game is just too good to ignore. If you have 3 hours (2 hours with experience), I heartily recommend the "full treatment" -- one of the best gaming (not just solitaire) experiences that I have had.

RATING: 6
Played very much like other State of Siege games, so lots of pushing counters back towards one end. The new thing about this game is there is a tactical combat element, where levies and maybe a few named units fight it out. The levies are totally random for both sides in terms of strength and the whole tactical sub-game seems to play itself without any player input (aside for buying a +1 DRM chit option & to commit your named units and risk permanently dying in defeat). So it didn't add much to the game really. 

As for the rest of the game, it is a "which counter should I push back", as you play the game through a few times and get more familiar with the card contents, you will have more strategy as to what to do, but as it is the strategy is pretty obvious to me. All I did to win a moderate victory in my very first game (of the 1st civil war) is to gain as much zeal points (think operation points) as I can, by taking all 3 South England cities and also pushing the Catholicism track to the top, this will give you the maximum 7 zeal points per turn, and hence you'll have a little more operations every turn, which makes all the difference. Also plan to buy the achievement cards, I ended up with 3 of these which gave 9 victory points which is huge and also to qualify to buy these cards you had to have pushed various political counters to the top which gave you even more points. At the same time starving off the military units on the board by pushing them back if they are getting too close to the end of their respective tracks or if they are besieging your forts. Fortifying your forts once you've lifted the sieges. 

The "meh" gameplay aside, the game is beautiful & very easy to learn and play and the fun part was reading all the narratives on the cards and to see how those historical events are turned to game mechanics by the designer. Note that there is very little historical modeling in this game and what happens in the game doesn't really correspond to anything historically, especially chronologically. The history is mostly in the favor text on the cards and how they are translated in-game.

I saw Calendale's video of the game and on contrary, I found the rule book fairly easy to understand, the pictography in color actually made finding things easier for me in the rule book. I agree that the "highlights" in the rule book is stupid and should be left for the player to do as needed, the highlighting just made the rules more cluttered. I don't like the 3 thin column layout of the VPG games, would be easy to read if they were in 2 columns, especially with the large font & many graphics they use. For this game, I just setup the game and read the rules as I needed during the game. Its that simple.

Its an interesting title for those interested in the English Civil War as a larger historical overview, but if you want the game for a "game" then you'll probably be disappointed and there are better solitaire games out there.

It's States of Siege, but with more to do and more decisions to agonise over that tells the story of the English civil wars. It's also a VPG gold banner series, so it doesn't come with counters, it comes with big heavy perfectly chopped logs. What's not to love?

The best of the States of Siege games. Lots of levers to pull political, religious, putting down uprisings, and of course the armies moving toward London. The tactical battles are simple but well done. Although there is plenty to do it is still very easy to get your mind around.  I liked Ottoman Sunset but this game is a big step up.

Cruel Necessity puts other State of Sieve games to shame, offering beautiful components, solid history, and a difficult AI.

Players take the Parliamentary side in the struggle, building their forces, and trying to do as nuch as possible to both put out fires and gain ground on the warring Royalist faction.

Simply said, a terrific solo game, broken into 3 modules for shorter game play.

Excellent game, love learning the system, only problem I had was that it took me 3 goes to get all the rules righ.

Having recently played a previous States of Siege game - Hapsburg Eclipse - I can appreciate more the design of Cruel Necessity. I think the problems with Cruel Necessity stem from the core system - a random opponent rather than an automa that reacts to the situation, and an excess of die-rolling. But there are enough player choices here, and they have enough of an impact on the outcome, to give you some feeling of control - in Cruel Necessity you are playing the game, rather than the game playing you. Furthermore, the battle system adds a nice touch of theme to a game that is already quite thematic by States of Siege standards. I like the broad sweep of Cruel Necessity, with the inclusion of the conflicts in Ireland and Scotland, and the 2nd and 3rd civil wars - no other strategic-level game does this. Some of the mechanics do seem to fit the theme, such as how the fortresses are handled, and the tracks for the armies in Ireland, Scotland, the north and the west. But where is the king's main army?!? Its absence is thematically ridiculous, and Oxford is too easy for you to capture.  Of course, the tracks and the fortresses make much less sense for the 2nd and 3rd civil wars, but there is no easy way to model these conflicts with the same system as one modelling the far larger and longer 1st civil war.

The problem with Cruel Necessity is that it is a brilliant game, but also sadistic. As a result is simply is not fun playing.

Luck plays a big role, because the average results are against the player. Whether battles (draws), or sieges (the Royalists get two tries, vs 1 try for you), the average result punishes you, and punishes you cruelly. Furthermore enough average results (not bad ones, average ones)and you lose either Hull or Bristol, or both and then are pretty much unable to make a comeback. You are doomed.

The game can be fun from what I read, but only after many many plays. Until you understand it, it is a very frustrating game. The issue is that as learning games are not rewarding (the game is BRUTAL) you have little incentive to clock in the hours to reach the mastery that will permit you to have fun playing the game (i.e not getting pummeled by the game). But if you want to have fun, then those arduous learning sessions (a lot of them) are a Cruel Necessity.

More to it than some States of Siege games. There are some difficult choices of strategies and tactics. However the position can deteriorate very quickly with a run of unfavourable dice. I'm not sure how much I like this system. I am perhaps more interested in solving a puzzle rather than repeated play, hoping for a favourable run of dice. Although the shorter the play time the more I tolerate runs of luck. But... that's the trade off - this game has more mechanisms, more decisions at the cost of a longer playing time. So, the part that makes it more attractive to me than other similar games, also brings an aspect that makes it less attractive.

RATING: 7.5
After 1 play: I enjoyed the states of siege system, although very tricky trying to hold back the four different armies while also scoring achievements.  Very hard to try and get the requirements to meet any of the achievement cards in the historical order, as it would require heavily specialisation and a lot of luck, plus spiking in order to grab the achievements before the event cards whittle the tracks back down.  The first civil war scenario is brutally hard and arguably unbalanced as the key military units necessary for a victory may show up at the beginning or not until the 26th and final card of the scenario. 

A great narrative with detailed historical explanations regarding the significance of the different events.  Overall theme of the first campaign was (in historical order): Scottish attack, Irish attack, West and north then attack persistently and Bristol and Hull come under sustained sieges.  In future games playing in historical order would enable greater planning and response, but would again suffer from an underpowered military (although the randomness of when the über military units arrive means that the scenario will play very differently).

After 3 plays: A very good narrative, with simple enough rules once the iconography is clear.  A really interesting theme, although it is tough to try and score a win. Just not sure how much of a viable game there is here (at least for the first civil war scenario), as it just seems like an exercise in masochism.  Absent an unusual amount if luck, I can't see how the starting set up for the second civil war scenario is achievable. Will have to try the later scenarios.

After 5 plays:  finally scored a win on the first scenario.  There is some key strategy which needs to be understood to get this game, based on how the game was build during playtesting.  Makes a big difference getting Cromwell early, but most important thing is to take oxford as soon as possible, and let the armies grind themselves against the fortresses, bump them off one space and heal the castles up.  A tough game, but enjoy it more now and even played on to the second scenario once (and lost badly). 

After 6 plays, winning 1st and second scenarios:  much improved using the dice tables rather than the fiddly combat mechanic (which adds time but not a heap of value).

Its procedural, difficult, and random but the gameplay (and its set-up) is very fast and easy. It doesnt overstay its welcome and its a game of making the most of what you have. For these reasons it makes up for its randomness from event-card drawing and dice chucking by not exerting too much from you mentally (the choices can be a bit too simplistic or too abstract but still plays a role in victory or defeat.) 

Its a good way to pass the time if you dont want a light filler but also not down for a heavy game.

One learning play - most involved SOS game I've played to date.  Mainly getting my ass whipped.
Second play - managed to stay afloat but ended up with only one point.  Not sure the battle system is worth the trouble with 90-% of conflicts ending in draws.  Not nearly enough zeal points to do what needs doing unless you are REALLY good at die rolling.
I like the SOS series and find this title enjoyable but I feel the added complexity here may outweigh what the base system has to offer game play wise.

This is hands-down the hardest-to-win States of Siege game I have played so far. (Before it, I'd played Soviet Dawn, Ottoman Sunset, Hapsburg Eclipse, Keep up the Fire, Empires in America.) As I write this, I've never come close to winning.

But the system itself is interesting and fun, and as usual with VPG the rules are good and clear.

The tactical battle resolution is a bit tedious, however. (There is an optional rule to resolve it more abstractly and quickly, which says something.)

It's a decent game. Managing the various tracks felt tense. The combat system is interesting but slows the game down so I'd rather play with the combat variant but it's nice to have the choice. Components are a mixed bag - the counters are good, the map rather beautiful yet not mounted and cut in half it seems flimsy and cheap. I found this really annoying for a game that cost over £40. OK so I have and enjoy hammer of the scots and that's not mounted but it's not cut in half! If you're looking for a solitaire game about this era it's worth getting. I may change my mind on future plays I'm still unsure whether to keep this or not.

The good news is that it is very thematic, even for all its abstractions it gives you a good feeling of history; also you can play a full game in 90 minutes or so. Bad news is that it is extremely simple and easy to win. The "options" are always obvious, and the only way to lose is to have a really bad dice roll streak; never in the game I was tense for fear of losing which is a big downvote in any game for me. Haven't tried the optional rules. Doubtful that it will see much replayability. Will keep it in my collection though because the time period interests me.

I'm into it.  It hasn't hooked me as deeply as some other solitaire designs (maybe due to a lack of deep interest in the subject) but it's a fun, tense challenge nonetheless.  I do wish there was a slightly different way of organizing the combat units, as one needs to be able to select them face-down but there are a lot to be shuffled around after each battle.
I wonder if my enjoyment of the game will go up or down as I get to learn it a little better? I think I'd play differently if I knew more about what to expect from each of the three wars, and probably do better, but I also worry that my strategy would get too rote.

This is talked about as one of the best solo gaming experiences and it is about a time and place that I am really interested in, which is why I ordered it. After my first play: wow. Definitely far outside my normal experience and really intense and interesting. Will definitely get more play, but will need much more thinking, too. Highly gripping thematic play and I love the little details from history on the cards and the map. A bit fiddly on first play, but I expect that to reduce over time as I get used to the system. Compared to Soviet Dawn (another SoS game I own), this plays much longer, which might have this make it to the table less. A full play-through can easily clock 3 hours.

Absolutely cracking solitaire game.  

CN steeps you in the events, machinations, and individuals of the period.  In gaming terms it's a multilayered State of Siege game, forcing you to focus on at least 4 (and possibly 7) different fronts/scales depending on your perspective.  But even that is reductive, as it bears little resemblance to something like Soviet Dawn, for instance (though that's a tough little  game in its own right).  CN is more than just a hydra of threats; it's a historical/political simulation of the first order.

This is by far the best of the "States of Seige' family of games that I have played. I'm not a huge solitaire gamer, but occasionally I find myself dipping my toes in the water. For the most part, I've found this line of games to be interesting until I beat them, at which point my interest in playing again vanishes. I think that's a function of the fairly simplistic gameplay. The basic structure of a States of Seige game is that a token slides along one of four different tracks and if any one of them gets to the end, you lose. Typically two or three tracks move, but you only have enough actions to move back one or two of them. There are also dice involved, so only about 2/3 of those actions will be successful.

Overlaying this rather simple structure there is a neat history lesson. It's not always terribly detailed, but usually engaging enough to trigger my curiosity into following through with some post game historical research. Still, there is no escaping the game is basically a card flip and some die rolling to see what happens. Not a bad way to kill some time, but not exactly something that leaves you quaking in anticipation. Fortunately, most of these games play in well under half-an-hour, so it never has a chance to feel as tedious as it would otherwise.

Cruel Necessity is a 2-3 hour game. By all sense of reasoning, this should be a disaster for a game structured this way. Amazingly, it is not as there are a couple of features that keep things both engaging and fresh. First off, there are eight tracks instead of four or five, which spreads out the movement and gives you more decisions to make. The tracks are also linked, so doing well in one arena can help you fight better in a different one. The designer has also added a battleline mini-game. While it's somewhat random and tacked on, it is a great deal of fun and leads to some real fist pump moments. The overall effect on the game state is small, but it adds so much to the narrative there is no way the game could be this long and stay enjoyable without it.

A solo game based on the English Civil Wars with the player representing Parliamentarians against the Royalists.  Each turn is represented by a card.  There are 60 cards divided into three decks representing the first, second, and third civil wars.  Some cards call for a battle which shifts play from the map to the battle board.  Battles are fought with randomly drawn cavalry and musket & pike units.  Early battles favor the stronger Royalists, while later battles involve stronger Parliamentarian units (Cromwell, New Model Army, etc.) that can be chosen rather than drawn randomly.  Battles are determined by unit strength and dice rolls.  A Political Track representing six factions (Ireland, Scotland, Monarchy, Parliament, Catholicism, Puritans) tallies how much support/opposition each faction provides the player.  Movement on the Political Track is initiated by either card-based events or player actions.  Without support from select factions, Achievements cannot be acquired.  Achievements provide victory points and a special ability or free action.  The map consists of five regions (Ireland, Scotland, North, West, and London) and six fortresses.  With the exception of London, the regions each have one invading army unit that advances forward within its region.  The North and West armies can eventually advance into London, while Scotland will assist the North Army and Ireland influences the Political Track.  The player tries to retreat the invaders and defend/conquer fortresses.  The game will end with the loss of London, loss of political support, or by going through the entire deck (all three civil wars).  A final victory point tally will determine the nature of your victory or defeat.

This is my first solo game and didn't really know what to expect.  The game relies quite a bit on the randomness of the cards and dice rolls, but it's immediately apparent that there are many decisions that ultimately will determine whether one has a chance at victory. And victory is elusive with this game.  The gameplay is tense and so steeped with historic reference and theme.  So much so, I am looking at VPG's other solo gaming options.  VPG's laser-cut game components are colorful, crisp-edged, and robust.  The map and battleboards are just the right size, look great, and well laid out.  The cards aren't of the highest grade, but are intuitively laid out.  Once the convention of the rulebook is grasped it is quick to reference.  However, the rulebook isn't intuitive from the start and some game basics were initially unclear to me.  Overall, highly recommended.

It's good, nice mechanics but just too long for a solo play through

Not enjoying the single dice rolls to determine success. Through a full game it averages out but the individual rolls just create frustration when you are rolling poorly.

Needs another method to mitigate random die rolls. Set number of events can lead to gaming the systems.

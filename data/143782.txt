A game about economics which I would recommend to heavy gamers. People who are not friends with arithmetic should definitely stay away. I like this kind of games and even though the graphics are bad, the game play compensates. A nice surprise.

Terrible components and graphic design lower the grade. Seriously this could be the worst component board game that has been released in the 2010s for it's price. The game otherwise is deep and calculative.

A game that is more fun to say than play.  Dreadful, dry and abstract - Pull handle A to make result B.  The area control stuff is like another game grafted on when the first was too dull.

Perhaps my rating is partly due to false expectations, as I was really expecting a somewhat heavy business/finance game, and it really wasn't that at all.  Instead, it was a rather ho-hum game of producing resources in combinations that allow you to fulfill various contracts for points and money, along with an odd area majority system that seemed a pretty weird fit with the game.

Uninspiring game play aside, the game rating dips even lower due to graphic design that I can only describe as shockingly bad.  For starters, the game looks straight out of the 70's, and not in a good way.  While playing, several passers-by stopped by and thought we were playing some obscure early, poorly produced game from Mayfair's early days as a publisher, and were shocked to learn the game was made in 2013.

However, once you start playing the game, you see how the game is not only ugly, but the graphic design actually hinders game play.  Contracts require several resources to fulfill, but scannability of the contracts and the resources they require were not taken into account, even though being able to easily scan the contracts is essential to moving the game along.  Rather than displaying the symbols in a uniform and expected fashion throughout the contracts, the symbols are just thrown haphazardly onto the cards.  Sometimes, a certain resource is on the top row of a card, and sometimes it is near the middle or some other place, all for absolutely no good reason.

Additionally, all of the symbols in the game were matched to a color that is displayed on some components, but not others, resulting in players having to do double-checks that should be completely unnecessary.

Point values and money values that are super important are very hard to read, and even sometimes covered up by other game components.

Honestly, you could write a "what not to do" book about this game in terms of graphics being both ugly and hindering game play.  I'm not sure I've ever seen anything like it.  It's like every poor graphic design choice I've seen in every other game all got rolled into this one single example.

I hate being so harsh on a game, but in total, the unexciting game play combined with the incredibly poor and game-play hindering graphic design choices put this near the bottom of the barrel for me.  To be fair to the game designer, if the game components were redesigned from the ground up in a way that supports the game play rather than getting in the way of it, the game might be a 6 or so.  Unfortunately, that just didn't happen.

A very cool economics game that is let down by a bad manual and terrible presentation. At first read, the game can come across as fairly complex but once you get a few turns in, you find a game that is fairly simple, but has a lot of long term implications to all of it's actions. 
Good stuff, but need to play more, especially with the "Standard" rules

Aside: what's with Mayfair's habit of breaking the rules down into "Base" and "Standard" instead of "Basic" and "Advanced"? I find the term confusing and it doesn't tell the whole story.

[b][FirstImpression/PlayOnApril8th2014][/b]Finally I get to play this (it was a 3-player game)! I heard many complains about the artwork and now that I got to see it firsthand, I have to agree with all the critics. Artwork is bland, and like my friend said, it looks exactly how prototype artwork should be.

On the other hand, I quite enjoy the gameplay. We only played the base game and it was fun, economic game. We were struggling at first in one quarter of the game, as it seems hard to get money. Two-third of the game, we've established our engine and it went into a more strategic game. The VP scoring is rather interesting as most scoring involve players being majorities in certain areas. 

I like the game but I don't see myself owning. Only reason is I don't think I can bring this one out often.

RATING: 8
Economic game with an area majority system. Your choices are limited, your cash is short and your agents (cubes) are running low.

You have to careful plan your actions and grab the big contracts before others do, but not fulfilling them yields a penalty, like the tickets in Ticket to Ride.

A very interesting worker placement/area control game.  Using the Base rules, it feels like a nice typical worker placement game.  When you use the advanced rules, it becomes more challenging.  You start feeling like you can't do anything at all.  You finish feeling like you can't do enough.  I like it.

Intriguing contract-fulfillment game with a little area control and a little engine-building thrown in. These are all things that I like so this is already a good start! The game puts this all together using a limited pool of actions (each action can only be executed once per round), which introduces an additional planning element into the game.  Works very well. Good stuff. (1 play)

Mayfair Games should be ashamed.  The art work is terrible, the components are sub-standard, there are misprints, there are component errors (e.g., black wooden components that were supposed to be green).  All of this for a list price of $55.   Considering that instead of a mounted boards, thin card stock boards were supplied, the list price is greatly inflated.  This is true even if there had been none of the issues noted above.  If I had paid list, I would be pissed.  Fortunately, I bought the game for next to nothing off of Amazon with free-shipping.  Overall a real poor job, by a well-established company that could do much, much better. 

The shame of it all is that the game is actual rather good.  I feel sorry for the designer, Bill Crenshaw.  Mayfair Games really did Bill a dis-service.  If you like economic games and area-control, I recommend the game especially at $15 or so.  Just know going in that the components are trash, the game is aesthetically a mess, but the game play is sold.

Rating based on about a half-dozen plays, all but two as a playtester with the game in prototype form.  The more I play the game, the more I like it.  The cards provide sufficient replayability, and there are meaningful decisions at every point, regardless of whether you are playing the base game or the standard game with all the bells and whistles.

Disclaimer:  I am a listed playtester for this game, and Bill Crenshaw is good gaming buddy.

RATING: 8
If you can get past the terrible artwork, this is not a bad game. Mechanically it works, the number of rounds is correct, and the number of opportunities to make bad decisions is about right. The rules are a bit lacking in clarity... so be careful with that. Otherwise, I'd recommend it.

Excellent, dynamic Base gameplay with three players, but questionable component quality and aesthetics, and a neither poorly, nor well written rulebook overall with a few unclarities at key points. Seems like the first edition was published in a hurry. For now, we only borrowed it, but I would buy it in an instant in case they publish a second edition with better, more beautiful, but similarly clear and functional components. Mayfair Games, what's up with your quality control? My rating mostly reflects the production quality; it is a great true economic game otherwise (somewhere around 8.5/10).

A game with two or three elements which are novel, but which is surrounded by a host of problems which drag it downward into the realm of "bad games". It's sufficient to say that the problems which cause the game to fail come from almost every angle: mechanics, visual design, and theme. Avoid at all costs.

Lackluster components aside.  If you like "chunky" economic games then this is one you should look at.  Very nice design with the requisite "agonizing" choices.  Rules could have been clearer in a few spots but overall a fine game.

Worker placement to generate goods by investing in different markets to complete two types of contracts ...a cycle sometimes ease by powers aquire ...markets that you invest on  are not only what your goal contract is but a end game points generator base on area control...some are frustrated by the components (fair point),it's not the worst and if you ignore that this is an ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC game..."don't judge a book by its cover"....

Based on one play: Sure the game is quite ugly, but give it a chance. There is a lot going on here and the layout is intimidating with a lot of cards and markers with hideous art work. But the game is well done. You develop an engine of production which you sue to fill contracts, but you are limited to five actions a turn and you cannot take any action twice in one turn. SO you must make well timed investments and get bonus points wherever you can. A fairly heavy game and sometimes there is downtime as you must calculate your best option, but we all enjoyed it (we had to play a light game after as there is a lot going on)

RATING: 7
Global Mogul is a resource-production/contract fulfillment game in which you have a number of actions to perform tasks, but you can't perform the same task twice in the same round (including the oh-so-important "produce" task).  Basically, you can claim areas on different regions that give you production (and also count for area control points), draft contracts, produce, take money, buy and sell goods, or draft companies that give you rule-breaker text.  The art in the game is horrible, but the game itself was surprisingly straightforward.  This is a pretty good game in the contract fulfillment genre--it gives you plenty of options, and you can focus on a number of different things.

Appart from the ugliness of the game, this a good game! A bit slow to pickup but does the job. The game is mostly mechanics like a game of mid 2000. It lacks in high moments but compensate with a straithfoward system. So i would play every once in a while mistly with 3-4 players.

This game definitely has some component/graphic-design issues, but the gameplay was quite enjoyable. It's a bit long, but otherwise an interesting melange of lots of different mechanics. I think the basic game might be better than the standard, though, with the auctions of standard being a bridge too far.

Mayfair Games is not known for having the best artwork or components. This game won't help their reputation. The components are decent, but the artwork looks like they printed the prototype.
This game is a bit of a dry stock - and area majority game. The artwork doesn't help forgetting that.
This game doesn't do anything really new, but it does it quite well. Everything works, there are nice choices, it doesn't outstay it's welcome... there's nothing fresh or groundbreaking about it, but since I don't mind dry games, I quite enjoyed playing it.
Oh, the rulebook is fine for reading but not for looking up stuff.

Initial rating: 6.5

RATING: 7
Inspiring game with what appears to be minimal TLC from Mayfair from a component standpoint, which is surprising. While the theme is dry as hell, the mechanics nicely support it. It's also fun to play with area control elements and tension due to player order and timing. Love gaining new actions by completing goals (not by buying them). Action selection with worker placement tropes, makes for some neat decisions. Medium weight Euro.

Some quibbles. The Go First or Last mechanic is underused, feels Avalon Hill-y and jarring. The Government Contract bidding in the advanced game is thematic and cool, but it's not really a bidding game, so auctions are again jarring to game flow and not very dynamic. Venture Capital is interesting, until you realize that it's specifically a game pacing mechanism and could have been simplified. Still, a ton of cool concepts.

RATING: 4
Dry and plain resource conversion, worker placement mechanisms. Quite sprawlingly busy with the increasing number of cards making up the "board". The design is solid and seems to be well tested, yet it just felt like more of the same to this veteran gamer. I empathize with designers trying to present something truly creative in this rapidly growing, maturing market.

An amazing economical game that forces you to plan your actions carefully, bid for contracts, compete for space in production markets - but someone made an terrible decision to give it a terrible graphical design that will put off many people away from this hidden gem.

Definitely deserves a reprint with an up-to date graphics.

There's a fun game in here. An economic game with a little engine building and a little area control. Sadly the component quality is quite bad and the game looks like a prototype almost. Still a fun game to play if you can look past the components.

RATING: N/A
Heavy but not horrible, economic worker placement (agents) game. Venture capital, emerging markets, government or private contracts, agents, market research, outsourcing, commodities. Do one thing one time. Build your engine for the end game. This kind of thinking I reserve for 9 to 5, Monday through Friday. I like the player board tracking chits for our production levels. Lots of bits.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Reasonably good business game. Quite number crunchy. Worker placement game where you have 3 or 6 discs (dependent on whether you do standard/base game) to assign to worker placement spot.

Get your company into cheap locations around the world including emerging markets so that you can produce or reap the rewards of goods/resources; so that you can complete government or private contracts (they are essentially the same but Government gives you a small bonus).

The end game has lots of points, so many that its very hard to remember; There is also Area control which generates points at the end of the game.

Okay, things I didn't like: The component quality is poor; it looks like a prototype.

The cost of the game is prohibitive when the components does not match this expense.

Further, I do not like the clunkyness of how area control is scored; you have card control, regional control, overall control, its like every form of area control is scored.  Seriously guys, make this easier and less silly.

there is also clunkyness in other points of scoring, you get scoring for everything to the point where you lose track of what is scored, what isn't -- there is no score sheet or score tracker.  Its assumed you can do all the work with paper & pen.

The amount of components in this game is silly and needed a producer or editor to reduce components.  Why is it necessary to have 7 different production counters for each resource and then another X counters for the same resource.

The better way to do it would have been personal tracks for each resource and you reduce the amount of counters/items by half.

Overall I did like the game, but its very dry, economic and the visuals and components, as well as the overall end game scoring clunkyness may put off many people.

I'm really enjoying the solo play so far.  This game is a keeper.  I also like the aesthetics of the game.

Component-wise, the cards are too thin and, instead of blue components, I had black (someone else mentioned on the boards that instead of green, they had black.)  I was also missing a red cube.  I was able to get the game at a discount at my FLGS, and it was worth that price, but I would be hard-pressed to feel it was worth the original price insofar as the components are concerned.

In spite of those shortfalls, I'm very pleased with this game.  It is quite good and features plenty of tough decisions.  I recommend it to those interested in economic-style games.

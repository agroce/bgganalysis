Very well done 2 player game.  Let's you battle with the other player try to get those cubes first.

RATING: 4
Not much strategy here.  You pretty much win or lose based on the value of cards that you draw, as high and low cards are both useful, but middle cards are not.  Needs a variant rule where you can discard some cards at the end of your turn and then draw back up.

Still, one of our favorite pastime games. Even with the botched Kosmos rules, and especially so with the original ones from the game's designer!

RATING: 6
This is a game that I really want to like more but...it has some faults. The good thing is that it's very approachable to gamers and non-gamers alike. Nice components and the play time is reasonable. What I don't like is that too many of the cards feel almost useless in your hand (eg. 6's,7's, 8's) because play centers on lowest or highest numbers depending on the current Hop (or tile). Also, too many cards get stuck in your hand at times that are just worthless. The is especially annoying at the end of the game when you can have colors (suits) of cards where there are no longer any cubes. You end up playing the next card that comes in to your hand for several turns. Also, the game sort of collapses rather than finishes. It all can happen in a so much of a hurry that you hardly see it coming. There needs to be more ways to get rid of dead cards from your hand rather than only when all eight cards are unplayable. When say six of eight cards in your hand are unplayable and the other two simply hurt your own side, a painful headache is what you get. It's just a tweak or two away from a really good, two player game.

Haven't gotten around to doing a DIY set, but I did play it again recently.  I very much like it, though the art is good enough I'll most likely pay for it, if/when I think there would be a chance I would actually play it regularly.

Played using the Rio Grande rules. I thought it was good but that it felt a bit chaotic as I had little control since my opponent could sabotage what I was doing. I'd like to trying using the designer's rule of not playing on your opponent's side until you have completed yours. I think this would give me the control I'm looking for, and would cause my rating to go up a point. UPDATE: I have played the way Stephen Glenn intended, and I firmly believe that it makes for a better game.

This is a nice 2-player card game.  Nice amount of strategy, but not a brain-burner. Doesn't feel random surprisingly even though it is nearly completely determined by the draw of cards. Pleasant is the best word for it. Gentle. And then suddenly, really mean! I like.

RATING: 6
Fun and has a nice element of stab your opponent in the back.  Can get quite mathematical, but that's fine unless you've got a headache.  It's certainly worth learning how many of each colour there are - and what values they are.  My wife quite likes this, so it does come out a fair bit.  I wouldn't say that it was as good as some of the other small-box 2 player games.  I prefer to play Battle Line or Lost Cities, especially.

RATING: 8
This game is fantastic!  It takes almost no time to learn or explain (a very crucial perk for any game store owner), but is still fun and challenging for the serious gamer.  The only complaint I have is that there aren't quite enough cards in the deck, which requires the discard pile to be shuffled frequently.  The artwork is nifty, and the mechanic for swapping the value of high and low cards is brilliant.

Recuperato fuori dai confini italici dopo una lunga e faticosa ricerca, è stato per lungo tempo il più giocato con la mia ragazza, a suo tempo agli esordi nel mondo dei giochi.

Grazie alla sua semplicità, alla sua trasportabilità estrema (che mi ha consentito di portarlo con me ad ogni spostamento, in giro per l'Europa :) ) e alla sua piacevole componentistica, è una opzione da tenere in considerazione per una sfida 1vs1 da circa 30 minuti (ha un "retrogusto" kniziano che potrebbe piacere ai più).

In definitiva: un gioco di carte leggero, piacevole da giocare e "rilassante".

- Lots of the game comes down to lucky draws of non-middle numbers in colors that are actually represented in play.

I traded this one away for Campaign Manager.  We've ended up replacing this game with a few other card games where you actually get to make meaningful decisions and feel like you are having fun while you play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Not a terrible game, but I sure didn't enjoy it (in all fairness, I am not much of a card game fan).  

The range of options each turn felt restricted and decreased as the game progressed, and card management became less meaningful with each re-shuffling of the deck. The number distribution within each color felt contrived, and the mechanism to free up locked games felt like a jerry-rigged fix.  

After the first couple of re-shuffles, the game locked up for both of us repeatedly, accelerating the re-shuffling and prolonging the game.  

Maybe if we were better at the game it would have gone more smoothly, but I am not inclined to spend much time learning how.  Were I to play someone better I would have as much fun as the ball of yarn in a kitten's paws, and playing against someone of equal skill proved agony.

While the concept of ballooning seems somewhat forced on the game mechanic, this is a fun, light game. The goal is to win the balloon championship cups by winning ballooning races of different lengths.  

Maggie and I play with the game author's original rules: no 3-for-1 exchanges and no playing of cards on an opponent's side until one's own side is complete.

A good lunch time selection.

Recommended with 2 players (best 2). 30 mins.

Nice 2 player game. I like the card management issue that come up in this game. Do you try to use up some of your cards now hoping to draw better ones or save them for when one of the regions flips, which might give you a better shot at picking up some cubes. Good, quick 2 player game. Has some of the same feel as Lost Cities to me but this is a better game.

Peacefully drifting balloons over the pretty countryside...combined with cutthroat competition at times. Fun, fun game! Highly recommend it. For some reason, seems to be quite popular among females. As in most card games, there is much luck of the draw; but it seems impossible to win without good card management. It is strange, though, that for such a great game, there has to be so much tweaking of the rules for the game to work effectively.

Broken with the rules written as is, but with a rules correction (can't have a certain amount of cubes placed) it plays pretty well.  My least favorite of the Kosmos 2-player series I have tried.  Very luck based as you want either very high valued or very low valued cards, and actual card play has minimal strategy.

RATING: 6
A decent enough game that reminds me somewhat of Schotten Totten/Battle Line in that cards are played to multiple objectives, which are of differing values. Balloon Cup adds greater potential for screwage by allowing the play of cards to your opponent's half of the tableau.  It plays quick,smooth and not particularly deep.

PnP version from G4GG.

After one play, am I missing something?  Yes, there is strategy and the last turn or two are quite exciting, but we seemed to spend most of the game cycling through to find the purple cards because they had cubes on all of the hops.

And the rule about cubes going out of the game looks like hops will be closed down before enough trophies can be won to declare a winner.

Nálam ez veri a Schotten-tottent, pedig azt is nagyon szeretem! Annyiban hasonló, hogy itt is párharcokat kell megnyernünk kártyákkal, de itt az ellenfél elé is kijátszhatunk kártyákat, és nem közvetlenül a párbajok megnyerésével szerzünk győzelmi pontot, hanem közvetve a kockák győzelmi kártyára váltásával. A játék kevésbé gémer, mint a Schotten (bár azért az se túl riasztó), könnyedebb és sokkal több taktikázást tesz lehetővé. A végén egy lépésen múlt a győzelem, ami akkor kicsit bosszantó volt, utólag viszont azt mondom, a játékot dicséri, hogy ennyire kiegyenlített. Nekem úgy ajánlották, mint az egyik legjobb kétszemélyest, és tényleg:)

Deeply irritating card draw lottery of an excuse for a luck-fest. Bloody dreadful in every way with no room for any applied skill, just advanced finger crossing and prayer required. How gamers can gush about this random time waster and give 10 ratings is shameful.

Solid two-player game requiring lots of thinking and maths, so fine for me but might be too much math for some. Somehow I want to compare to Lost Cities and this clearly wins that comparison, even though there are not really that many similarities, except two players and card games where you form rows of card balancing between good for you or bad for opponent.

Nice little numbers game with a pasted on theme which does not really make sense. Still it plays very quickly and enjoyably even when you're trying to destroy each other. Fairly random but the game is quick enough for this not to be a problem. Feels simular to Lost Cities in style.

Moved up to the top of my Kosmos list, with one other, taking over Kahuna.  I think the theme works and having to always play if possible (on your side or your opponent's) really creates some intense and anguishing decisions.  Supposedly Pinata is a remake, but it sounds like a dud.  Pick this up if you can for some great 2-player strategy, fun, and fast play.

The theme is a joke, but this is an enjoyable, if light to the point of effervesence, card game.  It seemed quite random at first, but depending on the skill of the players, some agonizing strategic decisions may present themselves, and there are many opportunities for nastiness.  

Downgraded because I never play it.

Really hated this. Spent most of the game (until it was abandoned) with a hand where I could only play one card, in one place, each turn.

Even when I did have a choice, the options were very limited and the decisions pretty basic - play a good card on my side or a bad card on yours.

Can't even imagine playing this with my kids.

*Update after 2nd play* I was right.

RATING: 6
As its title suggests, Ballon Cup is a not so quick and moderately fun - yet utterly unthematic - game about racing balloons: it surely works overall but nothing in the game itself or the way it plays makes you scream for having more of it.
«Passable» is a fitting adjective for this game.

Non-gamers really like this game. I use it as an intro all the time. Next time I'll try it with the rule that you can't play on your opponent's side of a tile until your side is filled (as intended by the designer).

[I pulled this again recently after not having played it in years. It still holds up. I don't think I've ever remembered to play with the variant rule, though. Maybe next time.]
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A shame that this game needs as much experimentation as it does in order to find the "right" rules for us.

There are at least three rules about playing cards on your opponent's side.  I've played all ways, and my thoughts are below.

[b]Play on opponent's side at any time.[/b] (Publisher's rules)
* The game works OK but feels kind of pointless.  No turn angst like what one finds in Lost Cities or Battle Line.  Wife felt it's too easy to be screwed over by your opponent. [b]6[/b]

[b]Play on opponent's side only when your side is complete.[/b]  (Designer's rules)
* Feels less pointless and less "take that", which is good.  But it makes the game slow and annoying.  It can't handle the situation where a player's hand of cards are of mostly one colour, as there's no vent.  [b]5[/b]

[b]Play on your opponent's side only after the same colour is complete on your side.[/b]  (Compromise rules)
* This works and is the best of both worlds.  Many difficult decisions but you're generally not easily stuck without options. Strongly recommended.  [b]8[/b].

(I prefer playing without the 3-to-1 cube exchange. Makes the game more tense.)

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A fun game in which you use card numbers to either equall higher or lower than the opponents cards. For winning the " higher or lower" card part you receive cubes.  After building up enough cubes to corispond to The Five Trophy Cards you exchange the cubes for the cards. The first one to get 3 cards wins. Fairly easy. And very fun.

We both had a strong "Meh" feeling about this.

Only play with the original designer rules (no 3-for-1 trades, and playing to your opponents side only after completing yours).

RATING: 4
Fun and exciting for the first few playings but ultimately frustrating, as luck seems to overwhelm all efforts at making intelligent plays.  I had to lower my rating from a 6 to a 4 because every time I have played, the game ends up totally balanced with each player just waiting for one card to win the game.  Whoever gets the card they need first becomes the victor.  Pointless after a while.  (I wonder if this problem is fixable with some kind of simple rules tweak?)  Anyway, not in the same league as Battle Line.

It takes too long for what it is. There are some  decisions to be made, but too often you are stuck with cards of colors that cannot be played or medium numbers that are useless or even can harmful if you have to play.

Maybe it would be more fun if you were allowed to discard cards to draw new ones.

It's a bit more interesting with the designer's rules, where you are not allowed to play on the opponents side of a hop, unless your side is completed.

After the novelty wears off, this isn't a great game. It plays out like War over four fields of battle. The game does have the virtue of letting you choose your card, but after a while, you pretty much have no choice as to what card you can play. You can often get "locked out" of a field, waiting to draw one color, and when you finally do, it's pretty random whether it will be good or bad for you; players who get totally locked out get a huge bonus by being allowed to discard and redraw four cards. The end result is a game that is far too long for how random and arbitrary it is.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Good two player game.  Everyone I know seems to like it.. has a real "screw you" feel to it, but still stays fun and light.  We play differently than the "real" rules by mistake, and find our version to be a better game.  Instead of taking all cubes for winning a particular race, we take one of our choice.  This slows the game down considerably and adds more strategy imo.  Dry theme takes away points.  The perfect spouse game.  Much more so than Lost Cities.

I feel as though it is necessary to evaluate games on how well they perform within their genre before evaluating them against all genres. With that in mind, this is one of my favorite three card-based games, and for its playing time, it's really, really enjoyable.

RATING: 6
Rating after one play. We played with the designer's original rule (can't play a card on your opponent's side until you have played all of the cards on your side), and employed the "no-lock" check (the total number of cubes of any particular color on all of the hop tiles must be less than the price of winning that color's trophy card). The result was a tense, somewhat over-long game. We enjoyed it. I'll echo some of the criticisms here: our choices each turn felt constrained, and the middle-value cards (5, 6, 7, 8) were rarely played by choice. But the first "problem" actually helps keep the game from being a brain-burner (this is a plus for my fiancee), and the second may disappear once we get a firmer handle on strategy. Overall, a very welcome addition to our two-player lineup.

UPDATE: Lowered rating after two plays. Choices were VERY constrained this time -- it felt like we were gambling on card draws.

This game has gotten a lot of good hype, which surprises me a bit. This is a decent little game, but it seems like it takes a long time to play because it becomes rather repetitive and samey about halfway through. It&#039;s sort of a Battle Line/Schotten-Totten, but without that game&#039;s nice tension. Some interesting tactical choices, but definitely middle-of-the-road for the Kosmos 2-player line. Has a potentially nasty problem with the grey and (possibly) blue chips, where if too many come out at once the game can become degenerate as multiple piles are takes on of play, or even completely lock up. There are solutions (which the designer has posted here), but the fact that it&#039;s in there at all is not good ...

A hand-management game where you're playing cards to both your and your opponent's side of various "battles" (the balloon theme really doesn't make any sense at all) in order to win the cubes in the center of that battle.  Win enough cubes and win!

We play with the rule that you can only play to your opponents side of a hop once your side is completed, otherwise this game is pretty poor with the rules as published.  Playing this way creates a lot more tension and makes the hand management aspect very tough! The reimplementation, Pinata, adopted this rule, which you should definitely buy rather than Balloon Cup if you're wanting to buy Balloon Cup.

My rating here is for the rules as originally written in Balloon Cup.

My wife and I love this game.  I don't know why people have problems with the mechanics and we have never had a "broken game".  You must play with the "can't play on the other person's side without finishing your side of the tile first" variant.

I played this with my husband a couple of times, and found that I liked it better than Lost Cities.  However, I don't know if I'd want to play it with my eight-year-old; it has a very high screwage factor.

I have probably played this 25 times now(online/in person) and I am sorta bummed about the gameplay. It feels very boring and luck driven with card draw.

Rated 5 after one play. Not bad... it's a totally innocuous game. Balloon Cup is one of those two player "you play a card, I play a card" designs very much like Lost Cities or Battle Line. 

The kicker though is that I own both Lost Cities and Battle Line, and I enjoy both those games a bit more. Balloon Cup doesn't quite add the same amount of tension that I feel in similar games. There's too often a few dead cards in my hand, and there's a few too turns where the choices aren't that interesting. It's fine though, and I'd play it again with someone that was devoted to the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Playing with the rules out of the box (you can always play cards on both sides), it honestly seemed like there wasn't very much to the game.  It's a little too random and fluffy for my taste--there are "heavier" 2-player games I would much prefer--but could be a game I could break out with non-gamers.

With the designer's rules (you can only play to the opponent's side when your side is full), the game is slightly more interesting, but I'm still not entirely sold on it as a 2-player game.  I don't regret buying it though.

Played by the published rules and didn't like it too much. Just a game of tit-for-tat screw the other guy before he can screw you. Played with the designer's rules and enjoyed it much more! But ultimately there is very little talking or player interaction during the game and it tends to end very suddenly when one player wins either the 3 or 4 hop and claims 3 trophies at once.

Enjoyable, but the limited number of cards in certain colors can create frustrating lock-ups.  To prevent this, add in the cube distribution rule (the total number of cubes in play for any given color must be less than the number of cubes needed to win the trophy for that color) and do not play with the designer's rule (in which you can only play on your opponent's side if yours is filled).

Two player card and cube game. Seems to have good reviews, but I'm not sure I see where the appeal comes from. Original theme at least.

Played online. I thought the choices were too limiting at first, but once I learned the breakdown of the suits of cards the strategies began to emerge. It can be pretty fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
The game is midly interesting at first, but after a few plays becomes shallow and dry, even when played by the designer's rules. (Which, by the way, are better than those the game is shipped with.) There is no sense of achievement whatsoever as players put cards down on their side of the tiles: you either have the right cards or you don't; not even hoarding a little to plan for the other side of the tile is going to work, as you have no idea which cubes will be placed on it. Eventually I sold off the game, with some minor protest from my girlfriend—but even she had to concede there were much better and fun 2-player games in our collection.

[b]Update[/b] When many years later I found myself sitting in control of the balloon cards again, I realised that asking anything serious from this title is overasking its design parameters. I have scaled my expectations down, and classified it as a children’s game, for when the little monkeys are learning their numbers and begin to add them together too. (Say for when they are 7 to 9 years of age, depending on their mental agility with numbers of course.) I have removed my rating as a consequence.

May 2007.  Relaxing and fun game for two.  Wife likes it so that is a bonus.  She is learning to be a bit more nasty in games and this one (when you play on both sides) helps to refine that skill.  

Not sure there is as much strategy as I thought when I first played this one though.  Seems like if you don't get the good cards, you are pretty much doomed.  Not much you can do with bad cards.

Need to give it a few more plays first before I give it a final verdict.  But, it seems like the game plays itself.  You are there to flip up the cards.

Components: Simple cards; could be on better card stock, and have better graphics.

Experience: I haven't taken a liking to this game, though I've tried. The openness of playing on both sides of the board, and different types of terrain, just mean that the value of my hand is constantly changing. I have no long-term strategy. I prefer the more diabolical (yet more predictable) Adam & Eva.

If you play with the rules that come with the game, it becomes semi-trivial, because scoring in all four regions becomes all but identical (just play your high cards on the opponent's side of the valleys etc).

Using the designer's rules, however, this game provides some anxious moments when you have to decide whether to gamble on your opponent not having a low/high card in the colour that will win them a region, so you can complete your side of a different region, allowing you to sabotage them on their side in the first one.

Played twice, once with my 6-year old and once with my wife. For some reason he understood it quicker than she did :P 

The game itself is quite entertaining and plays easy and fast. The theme is nice, but doesn't add much. The length is fine and I found that it was anyone's game on both occasions. To me, that's positive, as I like to play games without spending an evening trying to discover what the game is about and to digest all the rules and another hour explaining the game to others. In practice that means that I won't be able to play it with friends and family.
 
The first time I hadn't read the rules well enough (I prefer to start and discover the rules along the way), resulting in a different game, playing for jewels for the four cards at a time. Nevertheless, this was quite entertaining. The second time, playing for one card at a time, was fun too, but a bit less fun since the 1 and 2 jewel cards are played a lot while the others take quite a long time. Next time, I expect to play it by "my" rules again :) Will play again.

After now playing both Lost Cities and Balloon Cup, looks like my girlfriend and I fall on the Lost Cities side of that debate. If a game has any significant "take that" tendencies, like playing bad cards on the other player's side to sabotage a hop, she gets hostile.

A little too simple and luck dependent, but short enough not to be too annoying. It's not anything I'd ever request to play, but I also would not turn down a game. Also, it's a good game to introduce people to gaming. And play it by the original rules, where you can put the cards on the opponent's side only after you have filled your own row - it is a better game this way, and the turning of the tiles starts to make sense.

Wish my wife didn't like this one so much.  There is a little more strategy than some reviews give it credit for, in that you can lock up a race they have invested their best cards in while you try to repeatedly score the smaller races against the 7's they have left.  But that's about it.

A game themed on taking victory in various balloon races, or hops.  Players play a coloured card combination to both their side and their opponent&#039;s side of the table and resolve it when it&#039;s complete.  The prize is the cubes on the &quot;hop&quot; tile, and cubes are spent on trophies.  Three trophies wins the game.  A bit like Schotten-Totten, but with more chaos due to the deck being recycled so often.  Not bad at all.  It would be interesting to try with the &quot;proof&quot; rules from various Knizia games, where you can claim a hop when you are unbeatable - that would hurry things along a bit and save you having to complete hops your opponent has no interest in.

RATING: N/A
Due to some colourblind issues this game is less than ideal for me.  Even though the cubes are quite easy to differentiate, for some reason they used orange cards instead of yellow like on the cubes, and the orange cards are quite difficult to differentiate from the green.  Yes, there is a different stitch pattern on the balloon that you can use to differentiate them, but it just bugged me on a personal level that a) the cube colour did not match the card colour, and b) the card colour did not stand out at all from another colour.  Put it up for trade.

Talk about crapping on your neighbor, this game tops any other game I can think of for rewarding you for mucking with you opponents plans.  The end game can be a little clunky (has been about 75% of the time), but otherwise a pure thrill ride.

Last several plays have been with the designers original rules, i.e. no playing on your opponents side unless your side of the hop is full and no more than 2 cubes of one color on any hop.  These rules make it a cleaner and better game but not quite an 8.

Egy játék után nem tudok markáns véleményt alkotni, de azt elmondhatom, hogy tetszett, amit csináltam benne. A szabályt elolvasva kicsit rövidebb játékra számítottam, de így sem tartott volna tovább az első, tanuló játék fél óránál, ha a kislányom nem találja ki, hogy akkor Ő is játszik velünk (ami alapvetően egy nagyszerű dolog, csak 4 évesen még nem érzi annyira a taktikát :)). Az biztos, hogy a feleségem hamar rákapott az ízére, így pároknak nyugodt szívvel tudom ajánlani. Első játékként még nem éreztünk rá a finomságokra. Alapvetően mindketten próbáltuk sütögetni a saját kis pecsenyénket, anélkül, hogy annyira meggátolnánk egymás tevékenységét. Nem is volt olyan, hogy kényszerűségből rosszat kelljen lépni. Nagyon tetszett benne, hogy nem csak saját magunknak játszunk ki lapokat, hanem ezt megtehetjük az ellenfél területére, így ha egy lap a mi oldalunkra nem lett volna hasznos, azt az ellénfél térfelére lerakva fejtette ki pozitív hatását. Emellett még a kétfajta terület, a síkság (ahol ha kevesebb a lapok összértéke, az a nyerő) és a hegyvidék (ahol ha a lapok összértéke nagyobb, az a nyerő), annyi választási lehetőséget biztosított, hogy nem éreztem azt, hogy bármely lap haszontalan lenne a kezemben. Röviden, jó kis kétszemélyes játék ez. (2017.03.18.)

It's more of a brain drain than I had originally envisioned, but this is a clever game. I like the fact that you can either help yourself or screw your opponent at every move. As the number of choices and possibilties spiral out of control, it all becomes a bit much for my feeble mind to track. This game reminds me of Knizia's Battleline in more ways than one. It's certainly not the pleasant, mindless little game I expected... this one can be a tough and brutal fight to the finish. In this respect it reminded me of the first time I played Hey! That's My Fish! I was expecting light and cute, not a cutthroat battle!

Cards in five colours with different distributions must be played on each player's side of four locations, winning cubes by either having the highest or lowest sum. Players then trade cubes for awards, leading to a very tense endgame. Basic game play that can be taught quickly, but very tough decisions between experienced players. This was remade with another title but I understand the gameplay was changed slightly, which feels entirely unnecessary. Excellent game.

Playing time is too long sometimes. I feel like there is the cop out factor in how the cards can be played on your opponent's side. I enjoy it, but lacks that "one more time" feeling upon finishing. Also, there's some cards that just never help you (7 and 8 of red)

That being said it's still an essential two player game to have in a collection. 

I knocked my rating down a peg, because I don't really like the ending of the game. It seems more often than not the game really drags at the last 3 or 4 turns.

This is a popular member of the Kosmos 2 player family, and is a race game where you compete to collect cubes of various colours that let you qualify for trophies by paying in the required number of cubes. The first to collect 3 trophies wins! Simple to learn and play, can be relaxing I guess, but just be prepared to be screwed by both the card draw (you are required to have ultra high or low value cards so the middling ones don't really do you any good) as well as the other player (instead of playing cards on their side they can play cards onto your side to mess up your qualification for the win). 

This game pretty much never goes my way so I was surprised to find I won a few times. In each game I feel like I am either getting all of the 5-9s so I don't qualify for either the high or low tiles, or I get a bunch of cards in colours I can't use to my benefit, or when I [i]do[/i] finally get a card that I can use, my opponent pretty much negates my move by shutting me out of that hop tile by playing a shit card on my side. If you can play a card you must play it regardless of whether it hinders you or helps your opponent and the only way to get new cards is to show your opponent your hand and once determined you cannot play [b]any[/b] card then you may discard up to 4 and get new ones. Problem was that there was always a card I could play so...*shrug*. In none of my games has anybody ever had the opportunity to discard. It's a very frustrating feeling all throughout the game. Even when you win it feels unsatisfactory.

I was very excited to get this in trade a few months ago. This is one of the most recommended couples games I've come across on BGG. It is often touted as 'wife friendly' and a nice evening or coffee shop game. I found it highly irritating, very luck dependent, somewhat mathy and frankly rather basic and pedestrian overall. The deck of cards is small so there is a lot of shuffling during the game which breaks it up and doesn't make it play as smoothly as it could. We tried the 'designer variant' where he says he intended the game to be one where you play all the cards on your own side first and only then do you qualify to play cards on your opponents' side. Impossible to believe, but that made it even more boring and luck dependent because then you had the lack of tension of whether your space would still be free to place a card, and you were forced to play sub-optimal cards on your own side. What's also weird is that for a race game it doesn't really feel like a race, but more a tug-of-war.

Safely one I could live without seeing again.

I'm not saying this is a bad game, but it just makes me so furious...

RATING: 8
Fairly light-weight but unique card game with novel elements that are attractive but can wear off with extended play.  Requires constant mental calculation and decision making, but still probably depends more on luck than strategy, especially towards the end of the game.  Reimplemented as [gameid=141791]. 

The published rules made two significant changes to the original rules of the creator, and the original is probably the best way to play - for a definitive overview of the differences, see this article: 
http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/502702. 
The 3 for 1 trades just speeds up the game, whereas being only able to play on your opponent's side of a tile when your side is full creates a tighter game with tougher decisions, but also makes hand management more important, and a sense of more control and less randomness.   

For a quicker, more casual and chaotic game, use the published rules, for a tighter, tense and skilful game relying on hand careful management, use the designer's original rules.  

My preference:
- play with original rule of allowing card placement on opponent's side only when all cards on your own side are complete
- play with published rule of 3 for 1 trades

For this and a fix to a potential "locked" game, also consult [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/10076]this player aid[/url].  Just make sure there's never as many cubes of a colour on the board as there are needed to win that colour trophy (e.g. 3 or more gray cubes).

Good strategy article: [thread=322749][/thread]

Despite the luck factor, it's moderately enjoyable and has some replay value, but it can lose appeal over time, and there are better two-player games available.  As a two-player game, it will appeal to the trick-taking crowd however, and it's okay if played quickly.

Balloon Cup is a light and quick game that can offer lots of interaction introduced by the ability to play cards on your opponent's side.  Not much depth and the card play is usually pretty obvious, so luck plays pretty heavily here.  Sometimes you're just screwed by your hand.  Still generally enjoyable for that quick light fix.

addendum: need to adjust the initial setup to prevent "lock-up".

addendum 2: started playing with the designer's original rules (no card play on your opponent's side until you finish your side).  It seems much more interesting with this "variant"

A decent 2-player Kosmos card game.  Fun, light-hearted, cute hot air balloons, and something my wife really enjoys (which is a rarity).  If the cube/trophy scenario was a tad deeper, this would be a classic.

The designer's original rules (or variants) really improves the game.  While the published rules offer slightly more options, it ultimately over-simplifies the game and makes the flipping of the tiles silly and pointless.  As such, it becomes more random with hardly any thinking or decision angst.  Grade: C/C

* Played 10+ times. I see this as a solid entry into the Kosmos-2p lineup. Only problem for some is that since some card-counting and calculation can be done, there can be a little bit of downtime. It doesn't bother me, but it REALLY bothered my friend. Also, upon repeated playings, the luck in this game can kill a playing. Most of the time, it's okay, but sometimes your hand can be horrendous, and there's nothing you can do about it. Still, a good game that gets played. ((Bought from F; sold to M because it was too "Lost Cities".))

DEC/12 - For a brief moment this went up to a "9" for me, but then the next game I got lots of middling cards in a color with no cubes on the board and I remembered why it's only a 7. Fun diversion, but luck of the draw caps it at a 7.

AUG/13 - Revising ratings, I can't see this being a 7. I just get too frustrated with it, and it hasn't lept long-term appeal for me. RATE: 5

Just for 2.  There are two sets of rules, old and new.  Some think the old rules make a better game.  I like both ways.  

Quick, easy filler game with some strategy.  I favor games that, if I haven't played them in a long time, I don't have to spend a long time re-reading the rules.

An excellent two-player game.  It can feel like the amount of viable good choices is limited, but I like the aspect of having to get a majority of the majority of the 5 different sets of cubes.  An elegant game from Kosmos.  The best part - my wife enjoys it.

When we first started the game play was a little jerky, but once we got the flow, it seemed a little nicer.  Every card is painful to place.  Even though I STINK at it (there's NO WAY he has the Red 13.  No way.  Oh, dang.).  Pretty bits for a silly theme (the theme actually has chased some players away -- "A balloon race.  That's dumb.  Let's play Lost Cities."  [Yes, there is a little irony there.]), although the bag from which you draw the cubes was horribly put together, it's already fallen apart after a couple plays.

I have played this game a bunch now and really am not fond of it.  Mainly because we play it wrong somehow EVERY TIME.  I'm gonna stick with Voltage...

Nagyon könnyed kétszemélyes kártyajáték. A lost cities kicsit továbbgondolt változata, de azért nem kell túl sokat várni tőle. 
A tematika totál erőltetett, egyértelműen a meglévő mechanikára húztak rá valamit, hogy ne legyen teljesen absztrakt.
A lost citieshez képest történő bonyolítással sem sikerült a szerencsefaktort érdemben befolyásolni. Nagyon nagy a szerencse szerepe.
Talán egy hangyányival több lehetőség lenne benne, ha bármit lehetne 3-1-ben váltani, és nem csak a már halott kockákat.

El lehet vele szüttyögni, de nem egy komoly játék. Taán a lost citiesnél jobb, de mivel az már megvan, ez meg nincs, ezért csak ha utánam dobják... :)

RATING: 6
I liked this game, then I didn't, now I think I maybe do.  It's a simple, fun, two-player card game.  The artwork is beautiful and really contributes a nice aesthetic to the game.  You can play cards for your opponent on your turn, screwing up their planning.  This is a clever rule, but it means that there is always a good move for you.  There's never any reason to hold onto a card or deliberate; there's just too many decent options.  Plus, the game takes longer than it should.  I was going to trade it away, but my girl friend likes it a lot.  Then, I read that in the game designer's original rules, you were only allowed to to play on your opponent's side after you'd filled up your own.  We tried playing with these rules, and it was a lot better.  I might give it a 7 with further plays.

A fun two-player offering by Kosmos.  Balloon Cup provides an interesting hand management/set collection mechanic combo that offers real decisions which can often be agonizing.  The simple fix of only allowing one less cube of any color on to the land tiles in reference to the victory condition for each color prevents any lock up scenario.  A game that I can see rising in my favor.

Good 2-player game.  You can play cards on your side of the play area or your opponent's side.  If several gray cubes pop up, finish them one at a time.  You'll run out of gray cards and slow the game down if you don't due to the rarity of the color.

A classic 2p game. The back and forth play in this game is very interesting as your are manipulating both sides of each race

It's lost a little bit of its charm over a year but I still like it.  The three for one trades have "killed" a few of the last games letting the trailing player win.

We played this recently and I house ruled that the more plentiful colors needed 4:1 and 5:1 trade ratios.  This helped a bit.

WOW! Fast, simple, a bit random and gives so much fun! I've heard that it's a great game but in fact it's even more than that. There are two sets of rules - the designer's and the original ones.

Luck of the draw plays a *huge* role here, but a player can (sometimes) get ahead by smartly prioritizing, knowing where and how hard to fight, managing his hand, and mastering the pace of the game.  Sometimes you want to race your opponent; other times you want to hang back and delay committing your best cards.  The unnecessary flipping of the landscape tiles irks me, so prefer just leave them on the same side the whole game.  They are an artifact from a prior version of the design in which players could not place cards on their opponent's side of the tile.

Balloon Cup is a fun little game, but one without a lot to it.  It's a fun diversion.  I've read that the designer's original rules were changed for the official release, so I'll be interested to play again with the original rules to see if it changes my impression of the game.
UPDATE:  I've now played with the original rules.  [You can't play on your opponent's side until you've filled your own side]  I liked the game much more as it felt like the high and low status had a much greater impact.

Is it skill or just luck? Let's say you can't win if you're doing a lot of mistakes but there is no guarantee to win if you're committing no mistake at all. So luck is just the same an important factor but the game feels as if you have more influence that you actuelly have. As a filler it is ok but luck is a more important factor than tactics.

Fun card game. Random place bits on land numbered 1-4. Land numbered 1 gets one colored block, land numbered 4 gets four. See kids it's a progression! Anyway, only cards of appropriate color and count can be played on a tile (so if there are 2 blue bits and 2 red bits, each player can only have 2 blue cards and 2 red cards played on their board). Players take turns playing cards either on their or their opponents board. If tile is flipped to the mountain side, highest total played wins the bits off the tile. If it is flipped to the meadow side, lowest total number wins. Simple elegant. One flaw in the ratio of cards to bits, can be easily fixed by re-drawing bits.

The theme of this game is...well, worse than pasted on.  It&#039;s made up, nonsensical, and THEN pasted on.  Be that as it may, the game itself is nothing short of brilliant.  The mechanic is excellent, the play tense.  It is possible to get hosed by the luck of the draw, but it evens out over the course of the game.

Quite a good 2-player game in the vein of Lost Cities and Battle Line.  The neat twist with this is that you can play cards on either your own side or your opponent's side, making this a bit more cutthroat.

Utrecht 2015. Very simple and easy to teach. This game manages to combine a fair amount of randomness with a somewhat take-that-ish gameplay, yet it retains a very easy-going feel. My only caveat is that the constant re-seeding with cubes feels a bit fiddly; cardboard tokens could have fixed that, although setup would then be slightly longer and portability poorer. I also wish the Cup Reward cards could have been maybe just a single card (use the cubes as markers?) to keep the footprint smaller.

Update: We just ran into the dreaded 'lockup' and had to look up the fix. I'm starting to have second thoughts. You have the fiddly tile flipping and cube seeding mechanic; then someone mentioned that flipping the tiles renders playing cards on your opponent's side moot; it's possible to not be able to make a play, so the game comes with a rather poor 'fix', where you show your hand to the opponent and then swap out cards; and finally, the lock-up situation was never caught during playtests...! This game doesn't seem quite finished!?

A játék témája szerint hőlégballonokat röptetünk oly módon, hogy a síkságon alacsony lapokkal, hegységben magas lapokkal próbáljuk irányításunk alá vonni a ballonokat. A téma csak halványan van jelen a játékban, mondhatnánk azt is, hogy a játék során kártyák kijátszásával színes kockákat gyűjtünk,amelyeket beválthatunk győzelmi pontot érő lapokra.5 különböző színű kocka van a játékban, amelyekből gyakoriságuktól függően 3-7 darabot kell összegyűjtenünk, hogy elvigyük az azonos színű győzelmi kártyát. A játék alapját 4 középre kirakott helyszín adja. A játék kezdetén ebből kettő síkság, kettő pedig hegység. Az első helyszínre egy, a másodikra kettő, a harmadikra három, a negyedikre pedig négy kockát helyezünk el egy zsákból
véletlenszerűen kihúzva.
A kihúzott kockák száma és színe meghatározza, hogy mennyi és milyen színű lapokat helyezhetünk le
a helyszínek két oldalára. Ha például a kettes helyszínen van egy zöld és egy kék kocka, akkor mindkét
oldalra egy kék és egy zöld lapot kell kirakni. A helyszínt akkor értékeljük ki, hogy ki vitte az ütést, azaz ki kapja a kockákat, ha a megfelelő lapokat leraktuk mellé.Síkság esetén az viszi a kockákat, akinek
az oldalán lévő lapok összértéke kisebb, mint a másik oldalé, hegység esetén pedig azé az ütés, akinek az oldalán a lapok összértéke nagyobb. Döntetlen esetén az kapja a kockákat, aki az utolsó lapot lerakta. Ha az értékelés megtörtént, akkor a helyszín megváltozik, vagyis síkságból hegység, hegységből pedig síkság
lesz, kihúzzuk rá a megfelelő számú kockát.

Számomra a játékot az teszi érdekessé a Schotten-Tottennel szemben, hogy a lapokat nem csak az én oldalamra, hanem az ellenfél oldalára is lerakhatok. A kártyák 1-től 13-ig vannak számozva, és mivel hol a legkisebbekre, hol a legnagyobbakra van szükségünk, így igazából a középes értékű lapok minősülnek rossznak. A Schotten-Tottennél gyakran van olyan érzése a játékosnak, hogy beragadt, és csak rossz lapokat
tud lerakni, mivel nincs lehetőség módosítani az elkezdett sort. Itt viszont a rossz lap éppen amiatt válik jó lappá, hogy le tudjuk rakni ellenfelünk oldalára. Persze a káröröm nem egyoldalú, hiszen az ellenfelünk is hasonló módon bombáz minket. Inkább kijátszok a saját oldalamra egy nem annyira tökéletes lapot, csak hogy az ellenfél ne tudjon belenyúlni az adott sorba. Ha pedig egy számomra teljesen rossz kártya van a kezemben, azt gyorsan lerakom az ellenfél oldalára.

a kártya- és kockahúzások miatt a szerencsefaktor magas, de a könnyed játékmenet miatt ez teljesen elfogadható. Ez egy hangulatos, könnyen megtanulható, mégis változatos és  szórakoztató kétszemélyes játék.

Balloon Cup is loads of fun.  It involves playing cards on either side of the table (your side or your opponent's side) to fly balloons over mountains or plains.  The fun thing about this game is that you can play good cards on your side or bad cards on your opponent's side and completely mess up his plans.  That is the unique thing about this game and it works very well.  My son and I have had lots of fun with this one.  It does seem to get old and tiring after a while though.  I think I am played out on this one.  (I played many many games before I started logging them.)  That's why I'm giving it a "6."  Make that a "5".  I'm starting to dread the thought of playing it.

I can see where there is strategy here.  It's all about playing the right cards at the right time and saving them until you are ready to use them (since of course you can predict what you will need and you know it will be valuable when tiles flip).  There is probably a strategic element to deciding when to take trophies too.  

For me, though, this is one of those games that's almost all helpless frustration and very little fun.  Not really interested in playing again. (1 play)

This is a FANTASTIC 2 player game. It can be very simple for younger people or innexperienced/light gamers to get into, but can also be very strategic the more you play. It's great as a travel game because it takes up very little space (basically a deck of cards, 5 small durable cardboard tiles, and a small bag of tiny wooden cubes), and takes up very little time. It's a FRIENDLY competitive game.

This beats out Lost Cities as the first spouse game I would suggest.

I bought this to play with my wife only to discover she is TERRIFIED of hot air balloons! Fortunately, we still enjoy it.

The freeze-up problem was so easily fixed it doesn't detract from my enjoyment. As silly as it is, I think this would be a 9 or 10 if they had stuck with the pinata theme!

First played this on Jan 20th, 2007.  This is a decent filler game.  It doesn't take much to explain the rules and it does go pretty quickly.  It seems there is a bit more luck in this game than I thought.  If you're tired of the same old games, this is worth a play or two.

I like this game for 2. You can really annoy each other. And you have to use strategy to win the game. Though is very easy to play. Good game. 

I have to rewrite this review a bit. The use of strategy.. change that in .. not much strategy. :)  But still the game is fun an relaxing to play. 

I just lost and won some games because if the cards i drew. So i think this game is more luck then strategy. But i stick with the fact that its a pleasant time filler if you not in the mood for heavy gaming.

First off I prefer to play a modified version of RGG and Mr. Glenn's rules (you may only play on your opponent's side if you have a majority of cards already on your side of the hop).  As written, the game is a bit too random and probably only scores a 5-6.  With the modified rules, there's some new elements of blocking, pacing, and an increased sense of hand management.  I've also played the color variant, but don't care for it as much since it's too easy to get stuck being unable to play.  Also, I suggest playing with no more than half a cup's color cubes, rounded up, out at a time to avoid end game lock-ups.  For such a simple game it sure is hard to keep track of all the rules!

Really clever game.  The rules are simple enough to teach just about anyone, and the game delivers an enjoyable, engaging experience.

The ability to play on both your own and your opponent's side of the "board" makes for a much more tense game than the theme may imply - i.e., "balloons" typically invoke images of butterflies and flowers, rather than the "take this, take that" exchange that you find here.

Jul08: Well, it's definitely in the same vein as Lost Cities and Schotten Totten.  I think I still prefer ST for it's simple yet deep gameplay with touches of deduction and multiple win conditions.

However, Balloon Cup is still a neat concept.  There are some decisions to be made and hand management is important.

I've only played with the middle of the road variant listed in the forums here.  "You can only play a card to your opponent's side if you have more of the same color on your own side of the same tile."  The rules as provided in the box are silly.  Why ever flip a tile if you can always play to both sides?

Also, why the heck did they get rid of the pinata theme?  Made much more sense to me.

Ideal Players: 2

Description: Play high or low cards to win balloon races.

Pro: Easy to learn. Great introduction to wooden cube games. Colors and card values are familiar to anyone used to playing cards. Interesting strategy based on which cards have been played, or playing bad cards on the other person's side.

Con: At some point during the game, you are guaranteed to have all bad cards. There's some strategy, but it's mostly luck.

Balloon Cup shares with Lost Cities and Schotten-totten the properties of being an addictive light 2-player game that my wife loves to play. Balloon Cup shares a number of elements with Schotten-totten in particular, but it is a less elegant game than either of the Knizia creations due to the slightly fiddly cube placement mechanism (not to mention the rules fixes). On the other hand, the cubes are used to good effect in creating differential scoring and make Balloon Cup significantly different from the other two games.

I love the Kosmos line of two player games, but this is one of the weakest of the ones I've played.  I've tried it using both the published and the designers rules but found very little "fun".  There is an illusion of control and tactics, but the outcome is almost always luck of the draw.  There are very few actual choices and the game feels like its playing me and not me playing it.

This is one of my favorites, if not my favorite,  two players light game. It is very easy to teach making it perfect for non gamers, it plays very fast and it is very Fun. I totally recommend it. 

Edit 2011-07-20

I still like this game a lot but Schotten-Totten (Battle Line) is now my favorite light 2 players game.

Edit 2012-02-29

I know the game has a lot of luck but I still have fun playing it :) besides as the game is realtively short I don´t care about that. One of the few games my mom will play with me.

2012-08-03

I have played this 54 times (not counting pre 2010) and I still like it, however as my taste in boardgames is evolving I don’t want to play this so often. So I downgraded its rating to a 7.

Edit 2012-09-17

Balloon Cup will always have a place in my heart, however it is a game that is losing ground. I play it a lot on Yucata because it helps me advance in the ranks, but this is not a game I will like to play often. It has a decent amount of luck. Still a good light game to introduce new people to the hobby.

A very light game.

We have enjoyed it a great deal though. It's clean, fast, and very simple to learn/teach. I've read about possible endgame stalmates that break the game but we have played maybe 30-40 times and it thus far has never happened to us. 

The game can play as friendly or as confrontationally as you would like. If you don't like conflict in your games, play your cards sololy on your side of the board. If you like to make your spouse cringe a bit, play your cards on their side! 

A great little game.

Great strategy a good 'screw the other player' factor make this one of Kosmos' better two-player games.

The fact that you can play on your opponent's side of the table as well as your own makes this game very strategic.  Because there are usually more than one option available to you on each turn, you have some difficult decisions to make.

I don't think it's my favourite in the Kosmos 2-player line, but it's close.

It's a simple game, better played with the 'can't play on your opponent's side until you've filled your own side' rule, otherwise the game becomes a mean 'who can screw over the other person more' game. The game is well produced and has nice pieces, but the theme is pasted on and I'd be just as happy to have paid less for this game. Meh, it's ok.

After 2 plays: interesting design, but it seems that the end-game is too luck based. I must admit that we didn't use the cubes trading rule so far, so that could change my view on the game. (30 jun 06 after 2 plays)

Wow, it's games like this that give the Kosmos two-player series a bad name. 

First, let's be clear about something. This is an abstract. It's not "low on theme" or "poorly themed" or "dry." Its an abstract. It says right in the flavor text that you're working to collect cubes. No attempt is made to explain how this relates to balloon racing. I'd probably rate this game a 5 or even a 6 if it were printed as an abstract with solid colors and a nonsense title a la GIPF et. al. 

Second, exceedingly bland gameplay. There are elements of bluffing and "locking up" a tile, some values and distributions, and a fair does of memory. To my mind, that sort of thing is quite outdated and has a very small audience. 

In sum: A disappointing game with hardly any redeeming qualities, and that my girlfriend outright despised.

I didn't find the decisions challenging. Sure handmangement is a factor but luck of the draw (cards or cubes) plays a considerable role as well.

Infact in the three plays some cubes could be won by drawing the right card the previous turn. 
that's why I think that because of how the scoring works three out of five wins the game is too luck heavy.

It appears that there are some meaningfull decisions but most of them are very obvious.

If you have a lot of cards in a certain colour you try to play these cards as soon as possible.
That allows you to manage your hands better.
Winning grey improves your chances.
Winning red decreases your chances ... the other player  can use the red cubes  as wildcards.

Great concept somewhat marred by the seeming obtuseness of the card distribution. Pinata does this better with a few rules tweaks and a more clear distribution of cards (though the wildcards add a bit of a gotcha element to be on the lookout for).

RATING: 6.5
I ordered a PnP deck from Artscow and added some tokens. Initial plays are okay, but I suspect that the game is built up to be more than it is. Strategies are pretty obvious and after that it's mostly luck. Overall it would get the sometimes dreaded "pleasant" labe from me. I'm still confused on whether to play designers rules or publshed rules though. Both seem to have varying degrees of strategy attached to their inclusion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
There is a good amount of luck involved in this game, as the high and low cards are always more useful than the middling cards.  As Mark notes, it's a question of absolute differences, so you can always play the extreme cards on one side or the other.  Somehow, it still feels more aggressive when someone plays on "your" side though.

Solid 2 player game from Kosmos in which you play cards either on your side or your opponent's side of the terrain to earn cubes.  Gain a majority of a cube color and take a trophy.  Whoever wins 3 trophies wins the game.  One twist - high cards are valuable in the mountains where highest score takes the cubes while low cards are best in the plains where lowest score takes the cubes.

Intriguing two-player card game.  Turns typically offer a number of interesting decisions with a good balance between tactics and the luck of the draw. UPDATE: I only play a modified form of the designer's original version now, forcing one to play all the cards of a color on one's own side of the hop before trying to screw the opponent and without the 3 for one trade rule (which leads to far too many "if I win this trophy, then I lose" scenarios).

My wife and I had enjoyed the Kosmos two player line of games, especially when we were first starting out in the hobby.  However, [thing=5716]Balloon Cup[/thing] was kind of a grail game for us.  It looked like a nice two player card game in the mold of [thing=50][/thing], but with an attractive and colorful ballooning theme.  However, it was long out of print, so it was unavailable until we managed to prepare an Artscow copy, raiding some cubes from [thing=55670][/thing].

The game was pleasant, but it ended up not being in the same league as the Knizia games like [thing=50][/thing] or [thing=760][/thing].  We ended up trying a couple of different rule sets, eventually setting on the designer rules (you can't play cards on your opponent's side until your side is filled).  Despite this, the game lacked a lot of the tension in those aforementioned Knizia games.  The fact that you can only play cards of a specific color (based on those random cubes on each balloon) felt very limiting to us---but limiting in a bad, fewer decisions way than in a good, brain-burning tension way.  You just had to wait until you drew cards of a needed color.  As a result, the game felt a lot more mechanical and almost automatic.  On top of that, the cubes make the game more fiddly and less portable.

Although it's a pleasant game, for us it didn't offer anything that [thing=50][/thing] or [thing=760][/thing] didn't.

Have only played this the once, and will play it again soon - my first take was that it always seemed as though you were having to shuffle the deck constantly so that there were enough cards to play, and I found that frustrating.

This game may seem very, very random (random cards multiplied by random cubes), but to my surprise luck will almost never be the decisive factor in it.

This one will take more plays to sort out exactly how much strategy there is to be had. There's alot of "tit for tat" card play in this one, though picking your battles and trying to bluff/goad your opponent into ones that are unimportant to you to mask your true intent is the heart of this game.

Fun - 2 player game, probably my 3rd favorite of the Kosmos series (after LOTR-Knizia, Hera & Zeus).  It can be played on the plane with a little work.

Played in real life and on Yucata, my wife loves this game so will pick up the new version when it comes out.
Update: except they changed it fundamentally in a way I don't think I like. Messing with your opponent's side is part of the game I like. Looking for the play that forces your opponent's hand is what this game is about for me. Looking for what has been played so what cards might come out, knowing that the 10 and 13 are gone, so the gray 7 is now the highest, that is something I like. Pinata seems to be reducing that aspect.

A pretty average two player game. I wasn't really getting into it even though the game was close and there are plenty of opportunities to foil your opponent. Even when the game is neck and neck it just feels like whoever gets the right card out of the deck next is going to win it.

Initially appealing, until you run into the crash-bug (which took us less than 10 games), and then realize that flipping the tiles is completely pointless, gameplay-wise. Easily the darkest hour of the generally excellent Kosmos-2-player series.

RATING: 5
It has some patches, like checking the cube count for lock-up prevention, showing an unplayable hand of 8 for a 4-card exchange, and having a contested trophy fall out of reach when there are insufficient cubes to fill a tile. One remedy for the last of these is a 3-to-1 exchange, but not everyone plays by that rule.

I prefer the "compromise" variant where play onto an opponent's side is allowed for a color completed on one's own side of the tile.

This has been a fun game. It has a bit of a Battle Line feel to it, with the simultaneous play of four hands.

We enjoy the ability to play cards on the other player's side - it really spices up the game. Also, the randomness of the blocks that can be earned with each hand adds excitement.

On the downside, the deck needs to be shuffled frequently.

March 2015- Got this game in a BGG Trade, for Chicago Express.

The online version of the game (on Yucata) is really nice, since it keeps track of draws and tile flipping, etc, but there's nothing like having a real cardboard version of a game. Love it!

Simple but agonizing decisions are made almost every turn. It's usually close, right til the end, and the best laid plan can come undone in the blink of an eye.
Yes, there's some luck involved, but being lucky has never been so gratifying.

I've played a few times and enjoyed it.  I would only play with one rule tweaked: that of playing cards on your opponents side.  Published rules state that you can do so at any time.  The game's creator had it planned out better originally but for whatever reason it was changed.

Anyway, we played such that you could only play on your opponents side if you had already filled your own quota of that color on your own side first.    We've also played it that you can't play on your opponents side at all until yours is filled for that hop.  It played well both ways, and much better than the published rules.  See a discussion on the topic here:

http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/61798

I really think the next edition should include "advanced rules" and add this... if not swap it out completely.

Still, I believe this is my favorite 2-player hot air balloon game.

Diabolical!
We always play (after one fiasco!) that there cannot be more than one less cube of a color (than it takes to win a trophy) out on the landings.  This mostly applies to grey cubes because if there are too many out at once you will not be able to resolve them and will be deadlocked.

My wife and I have played this game several times. We did experience the gray-cube-lock-up, but we were watching for it and it wasn&#039;t something that detracted from the fun pace of the game.

Anything to get her to play something other than gin.)

6.0 - 5 Plays - Feb 2016 - This game surprised me with how mean it can be.  At first glance it looks like a nice game, but when you start playing cards on your opponents side, it quickly gets mean.  That does make the choices more interesting though.

[b]Remember to play with the following fix to avoid lock-up: Maximum number of cubes of each color in play out on tiles is 1 less than the trophy requirement.

Has a lot of "Take that" because you can play cards to mess up your opponent's side, so that's a downside for some. I enjoy playing this on yucata.de.[/b]

Nice two player game with some interaction. There are some problems if you use the rules out of the box, but these are easy to avoid by making sure that there are not more cubes from one color out then there are necsesarry for a cup. Also play only cards on the other side if your side is full, otherwise the flipping of the landscapes does not make sense. According to me these are minor problems and easy to fix, they do not break the game.

RATING: 8
Wow, I really like this game! It was not cheap, as I had to buy it way after being OOP. I actually own "Balloonrace" which is the Dutch version. Also, I had very high exceptions for this one. That said, this game exceeded my expectations. Admittedly, there is a fair amount of randomness, but considering the game lasts around 30 minutes, it does not become too frustrating. 

Update 3/9/13: My new favorite 2 player!

Update 2/10/14: After multiple plays of each, I've grown to like this game more than Piñata. For some odd reason, I like the balloon theme. It's just more cutesy. That said, the components are definitely better in Piñata. Baloon Cup has serviceable components, but they won't "wow" you by any means. Piñata, I think partly because of the inclusion of wild cards, plays a bit more swingy. I don't like that. Balloon Cup seems more balanced to me.

This game is actually pretty decent and I don't mind playing it at all. It's just very light, lighter even than lost cities in my opinion. Nevertheless, there is a bit of skill at work here. I think the skill isn't so much in deciding which card to play but in where to play it. You really have to keep track of those cubes! The bottom line is that there are better two player games out there but if you need a change of pace or a very quick game then this fits the bill.
***UPDATE*** much better two player games out there, avoid.

Initially my wife and I enjoyed this game a great deal: the shifting boards, take that mechanics, etc.  Eventually we tracked a pattern where the first player to collect two trophies always won (the game lets you use colors from other trophies as wilds, make further trophies easier to get).  that ended up ruining it for us because it seemed like there wasn't a point to playing past that point.

This game is a good solid 2 player game.  It is quick and enjoyable, very easy to learn, very easy to teach to others.

There is a large luck element but by no means is it only about luck.  Some have complained about the theme, which I find cute and light.  It doesn't really have a lot to do with how the games plays, but it stops it from being a totally abstract game.  The artwork is also nice, not great, but nice.

I always seem to either barely win, or loose miserably.  While my wife barely looses or creams me.  I don't know if I am just unlucky, or if she is just that much better at the game than I.  For the sake of pride I would usually want to blame luck, but because of the format of the game, I think she is just making better decisions than I.  Still, if I win or lose I really like playing this one.

Fairly quick, enjoyable, elegant two player game.  The game play often stretches you (choice wise) but usually provides one with enough options to make it strategic.  Reminded me of Schotten-Toten with a bit more luck but a bit more tactical choices to be made.  Quite abstract so the balloon cup theme feels pasted on but overall I cannot think of a better choice.  I hope to see more of Stephen's games soon.  UPDATE: downgraded 1/2 a point as it can just get too game-y and if it's up in the air when the game's close near the end it can really come down to a good card draw.

Fits right in with the like of Lost Cities and Schotten Totten - plenty of tough choices. I'm not crazy about card games, but this is solid.

As I play more, I am frequently frustrated by the endgame. With the 3:1 trade rule, it is not always in your best interests to claim a trophy. By itself, that would be OK, but it can change the gameplay significantly, especially in situations in which the next player to claim a trophy loses. That's a bit of a turnoff.

Hőlégballon versenyen veszünk részt; egyszerre 4 szakaszon. A hegyi szakaszokat az a játékos nyeri meg, aki a legnagyobb összértékű lapokat, a síkvidéki szakaszokat pedig az, aki a legkisebb összértékű lapokat játssza ki hozzá. A győzelmi serlegeket a szakaszgyőzelmekkel megszerzett különböző színű kockák beváltásával szerezhetjük meg. A játékot az nyeri, aki az 5 serlegből 3-at megszerez.
Első ránézésre a Lost Cities-t juttatta eszembe, azonban ez a játék annál összetettebb, változatosabb, sokkal több csavarral. Alapvető különbség, hogy itt az ellenfél elé is lehet lapokat kijátszani. Persze olyanokat, amiket neki eszébe se jutna kitenni maga elé... 
8->9 Minél többet játszom vele, annál jobban tetszik. Talán ez a legjobb 2 személyes, amit ismerek.

If this was quicker it would be a good game. Moreover, the deadlock situations are a pain too.


I think there are far better 2-player games out there that take less time.

So I recommend playing 3 alternatives (eg Shotten Totten or Kupferkessel) instead of one game of Balloon Cup).

A quirky little game.  One tiny annoyance has expanded in my mind to hurt this game more than it should:  Flipping the tiles to either mountains or plains makes absolutely no functional difference to the game mechanics, and doesn't add much to the theme either. I just don't like unnecessary little parts of games like that.  I know, not a big deal.  Also, the game locked up at least once while playing, which SHOULD NOT happen for a prize-winning game.  (or, it should be so rare as to be forgivable)

I like this theme even though the game is more abstract. Typically, I have a harder time choosing a card game over a board game. This game makes that easier. It's very simple, yet very satisfying.

Fun and light ballon competition. Five suits of cards, numbered 1 to 13 (but different numbers of cards) can be played in your area or your opponent's area to win a high or low sum battle.

My first impressions are favorable, though I do see the potential for over-analysis at times, making what should be a light card game into something that will make my head hurt. ***UPDATE*** I see a pattern developing in how this game plays out. It seems to always come down to the last jump, and whoever has the cards will win. It's still a fun game to play, but if I see this continue in the next few games, it will probably be shelved quickly.

Another quiet little game in Kosmos' 2-player line. A good one due to its ease of teaching and competitive 'Take That' gameplay. I also find its placid artwork reminiscent of the the watercolor paintings found in many books from my childhood.

Gameplay is a simple tug-of-war with cards. The ability to play bad cards to your opponent's side of the board sets this game apart from other similar games, although it can make Balloon Cup a little mean.

There is one fatal flaw in Balloon Cup: If too many of the same color cube are on the table at the same time, it is possible for the game to completely lock up, where neither player can play anything from hand to the table. Its a rare scenario, but does occur.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This, like lots of two player games, feels like a tug-of-war where your constantly trying to one-up your opponent.  You are usually at the mercy of the cards you have in your hand, but there is enough strategy and back-and-forth in this game to make it an exciting, quick, two player game.

Not quite sure how to rate this. I really enjoy the gameplay, but there is some inelegance in how it all fits together. My very first play had to end in a tie, even though I had a guaranteed win over the last tile, which would have secured the fifth cup. But because all blue cards were on the table, that tile could never finish.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
It's a push your luck game that is very fun when you memorize the cards. This allow you to know what are the odds, and present you with nice decissions based on several factors.

If you don't memorize it, it becomes more luck driven. It's also a bit long for a luck driven game.

I play on yucata and note the cards. This definitly gives me an edge (and otherwise it would be horrible, because it's impossible to remember the cards that had been used in a game that takes days or weeks.)

My rating takes in account how much I hate games that require memory; if you don't mind this factor, you would probably rate it higher.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
First impression: There seems to be some problems with rule that enables you to convert 3 cubes of already used type to others. Causing chain reactions that win the game. Forgetting that the game is ok but doesn't offer any special reason to play it.

It's absolutely essential to play with the designer's original rules to prevent this becoming a free-for-all silliness. But even with that change, it's asking a lot to expect players to exhibit perfect deck-memory in a light filler. Because that alone will create a good Balloon Cup player. And that is no fun whatsoever.

[b]Balloon Cup[/b] was sold via auction 11/5/15.
Received in a math trade (8/8/14). 

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]Out of all the games I played this month, this is the one that stood the test of time. As soon as I played it I began looking for a copy and was lucky enought to get one in a math trade (As a quick aside I had no interest in the Piñata reprint because the art is terrible). 

However; We now play by the designer's original rules (found in this thread) and it makes a great game even better. In a nutshell you can't play cards on your opponents side of a tile until your side of the tile has the necessary number of cards. This really adds a lot more strategy to the game and makes the game feel like more of a race.

Balloon Cup has been a hit with everyone in my family, but especially with my older daughter. This is her most requested game when we're looking for a short game to play. I would highly recommend this game if you can find a copy, this is one of the older Kosmos 2p games that has stood the test of time (The only reason it is an 8 is because I would still choose Battle Line first when looking to play this type of game).[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (9):[/COLOR]

[i]- Excellent 2p cafe game, very compact.
- My wife really enjoyed playing this game, it falls right into her sweet spot for games.
- Beautiful artwork, nice components.
- Easy to learn/teach.
- There is a lot of strategy because you are allowed to play on your opponents side of the tile/board which leads to some interesting choices when deciding where to play certain cards.[/i]

Sweet little balloon game...uh...Noooooo! This is a cut throat game of placing balloons in your favor or against your opponent! Be prepared for instant anger from your opponent...when you make a great play against them! This is a good 2-player game but it runs a little long...to the point where you begin to feel like...when will this struggle end! Place a balloon in the color of the cubes in the field, of a low number or a high number on your side of the field or your opponents side. When your score beats your opponent, then you may take the cubes on the field! Collect enough cubes to win a balloon trophy!

I now have a copy of Pinata AND the original, but for quite a while my wife and I had played a PnP version I whipped up since Balloon Cup is hard to find/expensive.

Have only played a couple solo games to learn the system. Seems like a pretty light, fun game. IMO, the publisher screwed up the rules, however. I tried playing with the published rules and got a bit confused. Then I played with the designer's original rules and had a lot of fun. The published rules supposedly make for deeper strategy, but I think they destroy the spirit of the game.

RATING: 6
Based on one play: By placing cards on your side or your opponents side of each tile, you can claim the cubes on the tile by either having the highest or lowest totals (depending on the tile's requirement). You can add cards to either side and once the required amount of cards is there, the one who meets the objective wins the cubes. Once you get enough cubes, you win a card and you win the game with three cards. The game is a little long and gets repetitive quickly, but the idea is pretty good and would be a good filler if it was a little shorter and maybe a few other options were present.

A quick game that although luck driven to an extent is enjoyable to play. Just enough planning involved, but without getting any AP. I like the fact that you can lay a card to help yourself or hinder your opponent.

This game provides plently of interaction in a two player game. Cards can be placed in either player's zone thus directly influencing who gets what. Unlike most 2 player games which finishes in 30 mins, Balloon Cup take about 45 - 60 mins to complete.

RATING: 5
This two-player card game just didn't do anything for me.  I realize that what you really want to do is to try to get your opponent to commit cards to a place that you'll ultimately win.  However, this is really hard to do, and while playing this game I felt like I it was always fairly obvious what I should do, and either it would work or it wouldn't.  There just wasn't enough there for me.

TRY Mar/06: While noting about the lock-up rules in advance, we encountered no such problems.  The game is quick, easy-to-learn, and just fun & challenging enough.  It felt much like Schotten-Totten to me, except that you could play on either side of the board -- which just increases the nastiness!  My daughter (age 9) beat me soundly.

This is a light game is all about efficient playing, getting the most cubes with the least amount of effort. There is a lot of focus on tactical choices, gauging your opponent and a little timing. There is quite some luck involved (random cards, random cubes, etc.), but it's not disrupting the game (only when somebody gets stuck without optional moves). I like it, but it's not a must-have.

One of our favorite after-the-kids-are-in-bed (ATKAIB) games.  Nice theme, nice mechanics, and we've never experienced the "game-lock" that is mentioned.  The downside:  possibly a bit luck-heavy -- often I've come from behind to win a game without any apparent reason.

First time I played I felt like the designer tried to mix some Knizia games (like Battle line or Lost cities). But still, with the cube collecting and with the possibility you can place cards to your opponents side, it is a very good game with lot of tactics and interactions (unlike Lost cities). One of my favourite two player games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The key to this game is to allow the playing of cards on your opponents side. 

For the first few plays we agreed to only play on our own side of the trick, and the game really bogs down as you are constantly faced with a zugzwang...not wanting to play any cards because you know it leads to you losing the trick.

Once we agreed to play cards on the opponents side of the trick at any time, the pace of the game really picks ups. Now you can hold on to your best cards and immediately dump your mediocre cards. And if your opponent plays a particularly bad card on your side, it frees up your hand even more. Now mediocre cards can become good enough to win tricks or simply to refresh your hand.

I was almost ready to give up on this game until we discovered the depth of playing this way. It gives the appearance of a high screwage factor this way, but it actually improves the game play for both players.

RATING: 6
A happy and joyful two-player game. Of course, there are many rule-variants and corrections. Try to find the rule system that pleases you most (three of a claimed trophy is a joker, you can always play to your opponent's side etc.).
The first time was with the rule that you can always play to your opponent's side and it worked well. I'd like to try the other variant too.

Balloon race is a refreshing theme. No nasty things involved in this game. I could recommend this!

RATING: 6
Clever card game, kind of like "War" but here you have 4 simultaneous battles -- some for highest card values, some for lowest values.  Rules are a little unnecessarily complicated and the artwork is nice, but as with "Lost Cities" there really is no theme, and there are missed opportunities: for a balloon race game the cube bag could have been shaped like a balloon and not just plain tan burlap, and there really is no race -- just winning trophy cards for each color suit won -- maybe some kind of aerial race track scoreboard would have helped the theme.  My wife and I have played twice.  She didn't care for it the first game but was willing to try it a second time and liked it better.  Not a great game, but enjoyable enough to pull it once in a while as an alternative to "Lost Cities."  PS.  I wish it had more cards so you don't have to reshuffle the deck 6-8 times a game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
On the very light side of things. Very enjoyable. However going for the highest score or the lowest is irrelevant as you can place cards on either side. I know there's a variant where it does matter, but out of the box it doesn't, it's fiddly and unnecessary. This doesn't stop from making it an excellent game of course.

PnP version from Artscow.

Played 2 games tonight. Both games with designer's rule of putting on self side first before putting down on the other's side. The first game was with no 3-for-1 trade and the second game with 3-for-1 trade. The game lacks tension, and feels a little bit of the game plays for itself. Is it too much randomness? I don't know. I will need more plays to find out. Rating base on initial impression of the game where I don't feel the urge to bring out the game.


---- Update ----
After a 9-month hiatus of shelving this game we played again. After all these other games that my fiancee tried she "gets" this game right away. In the previous sessions she didn't seem to "get" the nuance of the game so she wasn't enjoying herself. She knows how to play this time and it made the game more intense than before. Rating backs up from 6 --> 7.

---- Update ----
With a lot of games that plays well at 2-players, the urge to play this game has gotten a lot lower. The most recent play proved it to me. Rating back to 6 from 7.

Neat cutthroat two player game. Feels close to Battleline, but because of the card and cube distribution, calculating your chances seems a bit harder.

First play: I like the way that the cube colours dictates card choices, keeping the pace of the game moving. There is the occasional "take that" and the number crunching which interferes with play. I like how flipping the hop tile makes weak hands strong and vice versa, very ingenious mechanic and a timing consideration. Another plus feature is all the play condenses to claiming cubes then down to claiming trophies, making it easier to determine scoring status. Shame it doesn't provoke a balloon trip, otherwise my rating would go up.

This is a light, quick playing 2 player game where you draw some cards, and try to budget them. The only good cards in the game are the low and high numbered ones, so if you luck into a lot of cards in the middle of the spectrum, you will lose. You play cards to your, or your opponent's side of the balloon tiles to try to compete for the colored cubes on the tile. The cubes go to whomever's side has either the highest or lowest sum in cards depending on the facing of the tile. We found it swingy and dull.

Great fun with lots of replay value.  Easy to learn and play. At some level, letting the game 'lock-up' might be an indication that the 'game' is smarter than the players (not always unavoidable).  Only real negative is the flimsy cards. The small deck is recycled so many times in a game that I'm not sure they will last more than a dozen playings, and it's surely worth playing more than that. The included bag for the cubes is relative overkill. I'd suggest a smaller bag and better cards. Recently played with the ammended rule of not playing on your opponents side until your side of the tile is complete; it does make for a better game.

I have only played on yucata.  

Balloon Cup is a neat hand management game but it suffers from the fact that it is difficult to do much long term planning.  Because you don't know what colors will come up next when someone claims a set of cubes, you can't manage your hand the way that I would like.  The randomness and lack of planning makes for a delightful game, one that doesn't induce too much AP, but it does not make for a highly satisfying strategic experience.

I found this to be a disappointment- the mechanics are overly fussy and too convoluted for what is at heart a light, "breezy" game.

Effectively an area control game for two players. There are four zones and players play cards into them to gain the cubes in those areas. Collecting the cubes ultimately leads to victory, though it is a little more complex than that. 
This is quite a fun, enjoyable game, but suffers from the same problem as Knizia's Lost Cities, if your going to play a two player game then either something heavy (like a big simulation game) or some sort of abstract, not pared down Euros.

We enjoyed Balloon Cup well enough, but I don't get to play 2-player games that often and, when I do, this rarely gets picked over Jambo or Blue Moon.  Nice light game that should go over well with casual gamers.  I wouldn't turn down a game; I just never seem to suggest it.

Update: Apparently, my mum really likes it and says we should play more often.  That takes it off the "for trade" list.  :-)

One of my least favorite euros I've played thus far.  Decisions are easy to make, so there isn't much thought required.  Balloon Cup is a bit more strategic with designer's original rules, but it's still lacking.  

Some people seem to love this game, so I wouldn't discourage someone from buying it, but I would rather spend my money and time on something much more rewarding -- like DIY colostomies.

This is one of my favorite 2 player games.  the constant back and forth competition over each balloon can make fro some very close games.  My one complaint maybe that if someone pulls ahead with lucky draws, its hard to swing the momentum back to your side.

Fun little "war" game between two players trying to get "higher" or "lower" depending on the segment.  I consider it a good diversion for my wife and I from Lost Cities.

Reasonably interesting and engaging, but there's a lack of control with card and cube distribution that makes the game too luck driven.

A typical game to play with your wife (mate), cause it is light, easy to grap, has some interesting decisions to take, allows you to have a conversation while playing, it isn't long, and has the correct amount of rivalry and meaniness.

A very accessible game for two players. I play with the 3:1 trade rules and that ability can really turn the tide, leading to close games. I've never tried the original "can't play on opponent's side until you fill your side" rule, but I'd like to. The only time this game drags a little is when someone locks out two or three hops using grey cubes/cards, but it's a valid strategy nonetheless. Fun game.

It's not as much about not committing to a contest or giving away an advantage as some other popular 2p games (Lost Cities, Battle Line), as you can usually make your cards work either for you OR against your opponent - and usually in a variety of ways.  Makes things interesting and means you can play less/more confrontational depending upon your partner.

I purchased this game solely on the basis of good word of mouth.  After that, it took a very long while before I was able to play it.  However, I finally got it out to play with my then six-year-old daughter.  She loved it and asked to play it quite a bit.  Amazingly, she was able to do a lot of the math in her head -- impressive.  While I hear that playing with some of the variants / original design makes for a more strategic game, we have only played with the basic, original printed rules (except for lock-up preventing cube distribution).  The game certainly provides you with some interesting strategic decisions as well as opportunities to stick it to your opponent.  Much to my (pleasant) surprise, my daughter very quickly picked up on some of the nastiness available in this game -- deriving much joy from sticking it to her dad.  At any rate, it is basically a game of hand management and resource optimization.  A pleasant little game to pass the time with.  [07/13/2007]

It has been a lot of fun, though she has not asked to play it for a while now.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Played 2 games. I didn't have a favorable impression of this game the first time round as the person who taught the rules missed out on 2 crucial rules (the ability to play a card on either player's side and the trading rule). I tried this with the proper rules a year later and I think the rule that allows you to play a card on your opponent's side makes a big (positive) difference. 

Gameplay is simple as players play cards one at a time to 1 of the 4 posts. Depending of the requirement of the post, players try to form the lowest or highest combination of values. The constraint is that the set of cards must match the colours of the cubes placed on the post. The fact that you can play cards on your opponent's side allows you to sabotage your opponent, and gives more flexibility to the cards in hand. It's clever and has meaningful decisions, although it can feel a little long sometimes.

[13 plays] Much more luck than skill in this game. But there are fun amounts of tension, interesting card mechanics, and some clever scoring. I'd encourage anyone to give this game a try and see what they think for themselves. For me, the end game, however, seemed unsatisfactorily clunky compared to the nice tension all the way up to that point. Also, the fix to prevent lock-up (which does happen, folks) is just a little too klunky for my taste in such a simple game.  I've traded this now since I have other 2 player options I consider more elegant and smoother playing.

Most recent play Sept '14.

RATING: 7.25
It's a tight battle for control of coloured cubes (used to purchase Balloon Cups!). The card laying system is remniscent of Battleline/Shotten Totten/Lost Cities.

Sure, players can get hosed by bad draw but games are usually close and there is lots of tension in a smart package. One of the better 2 player Kosmos games (Jambo and Kahuna being another 2 outstanding ones!)

RATING: 7.5
First few games were nasty, I usually only had one or two cards to choose from and they usually only had one &#039;good&#039; place to be laid. But even with this possibly I still enjoy the game and look forward to playing it more.

Card. Play high and low cards to help yourself or screw your opponent on the way to winning balloon races. Bought this to entice my wife, but it just doesn't do it for her. Maybe I need to try Lost Cities or Battle Line? I'd trade it away but I think it will be good for my kids when they're older.

Traded. Too many good 2p games competing in this space for me.

Curious if the revised game Pinata (which was the original theme for this) is better.

RATING: 6
I like Balloon Cup. It's a fun and light game about making short balloon hops, or races, through the mountains and fields. The decision tree is reminiscent of Battle Line, which I love, but a bit simpler. Instead of battling for flags, you're battling for the balloon hops (and each hop has some colored cubes that go to the winner). Instead of the hands of Battle Line, you merely have to play down a set of cards which color-match the cubes you are fighting for. And the sophistication of the suits is gone - you are merely going for either the highest sum or the lowest sum. Ultimately, you will turn in colored cubes for "balloon cups" - the equivalent of winning a race, I suppose. People call this a race game. If this is a race game, so is Battle Line - but the terminology seems silly. In every game, one races to win, right? I think Balloon Cup is a battling game, and game of pretty direct conflict. It's light, quick, and fun. The only downside is that I am colorblind, and this game is *terrible* for me in terms of recognizing the colors of both the cubes and the cards I am holding. If the color choice were better, this game would receive a solid 7 rating from me. As is, it can be very frustrating, and it gets a 6!

4 mezőn szállnak fel a hőlégballonjaink és megpróbálják megszerezni a mezőre került különböző színű kockákat. Meghatározott számú kockák adott színű díjra válthatóak be, amelyek közül bármely három megszerzése a játék megnyerését jelenti. A mezőn lévő kockák egyszerűen csak vagy az összértékben kisebb vagy nagyobb odatett ballonok alapján dőlnek el. A játékosok saját maguk és ellenfelük elé is játszhatnak ki körönként egy ballont, egy-egy mezőhöz pedig annyi kerülhet, ahány kocka éppen rajta van és pontosan azokban a színekben. A lapok különböző színű ballonokat és számokat tartalmaznak. Tulajdonképpen ennyi az egész szabály, ez alapján rögtön feltűnik, hogy tulajdonképpen egy egyszerűsített Schotten-Totten (Battle Line) játékkal van dolgunk, annyi különbséggel, hogy nem csak magunk, hanem ellenfelünk oldalára is játszhatunk ki lapot. A játék könnyed, viszonylag gyors és könnyebben eladható, mint a Schotten így könnyed kikapcsolódást nyújthat párok és kezdő társasozók számára, illetve jó átvezetőnek is. A Schotten mélyebb játék, de hozzám inkább ez áll közelebb.

[2014-09-05]
Változott az álláspontom. A Battle Line sokkal közelebb áll hozzám. Több taktikai lehetőség, mélyebb játék. A Balloon Cupban óriási a szerencse szerepe, igaz én azt a változatát játszom a játéknak, amiben csak akkor lehet az ellenfél oldalára lapot tenni, ha a mienken már betelt az a mező. Kipróbálom majd az új szabállyal is, de addig is rontok egyet a ponton. 7->6

Still though, this would be a fine game to play with nongamers. I thankfully rarely need to do that, so I just don't see the need to own this.  I wouldn't turn it down if asked to play, but I wouldn't ever suggest it.

Relatively light filler game that has some interesting "trick taking" like play.  The field side of each of the tiles requires that you attempt to win the various cubes by offering up the lowest card total and the mountain side requires that the tile be won by offering up the highest card total. One interesting twist to the game is that you can play on the other player's side as well as your own.

My wife and I enjoy this on occasion -- I feel like it runs on a bit longer than it should at times, but it's a fun exercise in math and evil.  Yup, I said evil -- you can really mess someone up in this game!

*Update* - played with the designer's rules of not being able to play any cards on your opponent until you fill up your side first.  I'm not sure this is a good idea, in fact, it might be broken.  It causes a lot of situations where you either put a card on your side that hurts you, or makes you discard your hand hoping to find something that you can play.

Balloon Cup, by Stephen Glenn, is my "new favorite" 2 player game. With a simple premise and a surprising amount of strategy, Balloon Cup offers the casual gamer the opportunity to introduce a fun, light game that has rules which are easy to grasp and can be played in under 30 minutes. It's a nice filler game for the more serious enthusiast but its real lure lies in its ability to attract the wife or girlfriend. The ladies love this one, and for good reason.

If you are looking for an inexpensive game to break the nerd ice with your girlfriend or wife, this is a perfect way to go.

Balloon Cup isn't going to blow you away if you've played similar 2p games, like Battle Line and Lost Cities. But it's a good example of its genre, on the meaner side. I'll add a few caveats. While you're seldom without options, the card draw is important. Also, the game can lock up, forcing an early unsatisfying end, though rarely. Overall, it's more dynamic than Lost Cities but not as intense as Battle Line. The real question is: how many half-hour 2p card games does a person need?

Published rules seem pretty pointless (being able to play on either side) -- comes down to luck of the draw, and decision about which of the 4 tiles to play on. Playing with the designer's rules (cannot play to opponent's side till your side is full) seems better. Still, there doesn't seem to be much to the game; some decisions, a lot of luck.

Very fast to learn, incredibly fun, highly addictive (because next time, you know, I will make the right choice with my cards...). A light, very luck based yet engaging two player game, the perfect game to start the night and then never switch to anything else because you play it over and over again. And then you probably don't want to touch it for months ;-)

I was so excited when I saw a review about it, but when I first played it, it was a disappointment unfortunately..  (specially cause I designed my own copy because it's out of print)

The options are often limited and I had to play bad cards because I didn't have anything else. Other problem is that the rare colors can partially block the game.

This (along with "Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation" and "Through the Desert") is one of the first games I purchased when I started my game collection a few years back, thinking it might be a fun one to play with my wife.  I was sucked in by the exraordinarily high ratings it had at the time, and enjoyed the first few plays, but very quickly lost interest.  My parents found it to be a fun game, and my wife seems to still enjoy it, but (and maybe my opinion is clouded by the fact that I'm not a fan of most games that are heavily card-based) to me it just seems like such a waste of time.  I know this has been rather beaten to death, but the theme is absolutely ridiculous - there's no way I can stretch my imagination enough to pretend that I'm participating in a balloon race.  Additionally, it seems to me that the game is flawed because (correct me if I'm wrong) the fact that you can play cards both on your own and your opponent's side of the tile makes the whole mountain/plain thing completely irrelevant.  I suppose if you made a rule that you could only play on your own side, that might fix the game play a little.  [Edit: Apparently the original design of the game called for something similar and several recommended fixes can be found in the "Variant" forums.]  But still, there just isn't enough here to make me want to play.  Game design: 2/5  Personal enjoyment: 1/5  Total: 3/10

This is a great addition to our two-player game collection.  After a few more playings, my rating has gone up.  It's such a simple concept, but there is a lot of strategy.  Our last game ended with me taking my second trophy only to give the game to my husband because he could trade 3 red block in for 1 blue block to get his third trophy.  Tricky, tricky!

Another good game in the Kosmos 2-player line (e.g., Lost Cities).  Kind of similar to the mechanic in Lost Cities but a litte more depth involved, which I like.  I particularly like that you can play cards to help yourself or hurt your opponent, which makes for a little more interaction and strategy than Lost Cities contains.  In addition the rules are easy to understand and the components are nice as well.  For what it is, this game does a good job.

[Kosmos German 2003 edition] {Balloon, couple; set collection, hand management, variable-player-order} BC is a set collection game with mild confrontation (you can directly play cards to hurt your opponent). There are some problems - not highly fun and quite operational and fiddly with many card shuffles, cube draws and tile flipping. It's somewhat abstract; the rule does not match the theme well and therefore it takes some time for players to understand the rule clearly.

The rules are confusing and seem to be broken (It's unforgivable to have 'lock down' issue. The designer mentions it happens rarely but it usually happens in my games if the variant is not used). Players should agree upon which rules to use before playing. If the rules were written better, BC would be a good tactical card game. Players can formulate different game plans and have tactical decisions.

BC is not the best 2p card game in my collection; nevertheless, I would play it occasionally. It's still a solid 2p game in Kosmos series.

After playing BC, I found out that I don't like games that force players to discard & exchange cards when he can play NO cards at all.

This is a nice try for first-time designer.  Looking forward to more Glenn's games.

[Update] I finally got all rules right. The designer's original rule is by far the best. The game is more engaging and tactical with the original rules.

Each card played offers the choice: improve your position or worsen your opponents. Alittle bit repetitive and goes on a little too long for my liking.

Just read that the designer had one significant change to the published rules which make it a much game. You cannot play a coloured card on your opponents side unless you have played played more cards of that colour on your side. 

It's now far less chaotic and more strategic as you get some advance warning of someone being able to play a bad card on your side and you now get the opportunity to play one of your own cards there first.

Balloon Cup looks awful and the theme, I think I described during the game as "junk", but it played quickly and smoothly and was a lot of fun.

Nagyon jó kétszemélyes játék. Az elején nehezen indulnak el a dolgok (azaz az első egy-két trófealap megszerzése lassabban megy), de azután a játék felpörög és pillanatok alatt vége lesz a kockák beváltásának köszönhetően. És pont emiatt van az is, hogy minél közelebb a játék vége, annál jobban oda kell figyelni az ellenfél kockáira.

I like this one, but only when playing with the designer-requested variant in which one can only play on the opposite side of the table when one's own side is completed.  Additionally, one must keep in mind that the game can lock, and that there is a FAQ that addresses that.  With those minor tweaks, it is a wonderful lighthearted filler with enough "Take that!" moments and agonizing of either wanting to play multiple, or not wanting to play [i]any[/i], cards, at any given moment.

This is the first 2-player game I introduced my wife to. She enjoys it and is willing to play it when I suggest it, or it is the game that she will choose if given a couple of choices.

I enjoy playing it and find it relatively light with some difficult choices to make sprinkled in.

We play with the ability to play to the other person's side only after completing your side of a hop. This provides for a reasonable amount of strategy how you play your cards in conjunction with the luck factor of drawing your cards and drawing the cubes available per hop.

This is another great game to play with your better half. I happen to enjoy this eventhough we don't play it as much as many other games.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
1/7/12 - After just one play, I have early suspicions that the game may suffer from what many small, two-player games suffer, and that's too much balance. There's no way to actually strategize outside of the cards and cubes drawn, which for the most part, controls the game. 

I wish there was an additional element to the game to aid with this problem. For example, the best small, two-player game is Battle Line. But if Battle Line didn't have the tactic cards, it would be another mathematically balanced game that would come down to the luckiest card-draws in the end. 

I'll probably keep it, but it will only get played every now and then when my wife want's something quick and easy and it's been a while since we gave it a shot. I'd still reach for Battle Line almost any time over this one, though. I'm beginning to think that BL simply best of class.

This is an Excellent 2 player game,  providing that it is  played by the designers intended rules - which prohibited playing on your opponents side until your side of a hop was completed.

For some strange reason,  the game publisher decided to put into effect some ill-advised rule changes that only served to cut the legs out from under an otherwise beautifully constructed design.

To say that they do not cause irrefutable harm to the game's design is a gross misconception. These are not merely niggling rule changes,  but they transform this game into an entirely different beast.  The play anywhere / anytime rule,  as published,  makes the flipping of the hops obsolete.  In fact,  it makes the entire game obsolete.  The god-awful rule addition of having three of one color equal one of another,  causes a cascading effect that can bring the game to an abrupt halt - however, should you be playing by these rules,  that may actually be a godsend. 

Thankfully,  I arrived at the party late on this one and was never subjected to playing by the published rules - which are filled with more hot air than the actual balloons in the game are.

I like this as a quick two-player.  A bit of strategy and simple but tense gameplay as you set yourself up or block your opponents plans.  Most games are pretty even, though I've been the victim of a few lopsided losses as well.

Great player interaction, beautiful symetric gameplay and setup. Just enough luck to keep it interesting, and yet strategic enough for different players to develop different strategies. Nice looking game, to boot. The second best Kosmos 2-player game, just behind Lost Cities. Lost Cities feels more like a card game, while Balloon Cup definitely feels like a board game.

This 2-player card game is a little too light for my tastes, and a bit repetitive.  I prefer something like Lost Cities in the Kosmos/Rio Grande line of card games.  However, I have yet to try Jambo, Hera & Zeus, and Odin's Ravens, among others.

Talk about killing time...

The design has its charm, and people I present it too always seems to like it. 

The game mostly plays itself, though, without having the kinetic energy of Lost Cities. So if you like this sort of thing, go for it :-)

RATING: 5.5
[thing=5716][/thing] is a hand management and racing (first to get 3 cups) game, in which players use cards to get cubes and use them to grab cup tiles - the first to get 3 cups is the winner.

[thing=5716][/thing] has an interesting mechanic: there are two types of terrains (mountains and plains) and, in one, high numbered cards are better, while, in the other, low numbers are better. Therefore, basically all cards have use, even if those in the ends (low or high) are objectively better than those in the middle. Another positive points is that a person can put cards on the opponent side, damaging her, which, in turn, reinforces that all cards will have use.

However, is this very thing (almost every card is good)  that makes, with the luck of the draw (both for the cubes that will go in the terrain tile and in for the cards), that can make someone jump ahead, and there is little chance (except, again, by pure chance) that one will catch up with the other - as every move will, normally, be responded by one in around the same potency.

Therefore, in the end, I felt more like I was being played than actually playing, as my decisions were, for the most part, obvious - it was, usually, just a decision of using a card to help me or harm the other - and, near the end, not even this, as the room for wiggle is small, due to the restriction of the colors of the cubes.

Still, [thing=5716][/thing] is quick enough to not bother with the luck and with the constant "attacks", as a good chunk of the game is harming the other player.

I will play it again, but I was expecting more.

A two player game with interesting decisions.  Try to get a small advantage over your opponent or risk getting nothing but going big. 

The game changes dramatically if you use the optional variant.  That is, that you can only play on your opponents side if you can't play on your own (which doesn't happen often).  Without this variant the game can become a 'take that' game, which isn't good or bad, but it does give it a different feel.

RATING: 7
If you don't like games where you can mess with the other player, you might not like this game. You can play on your opponent's side or your own. My wife likes playing with the variant that allows only playing on your own side. This is a game of multiple small victories with the end result of winning the big victories (trophies). The gameplay is not highly rewarding to the loser, but it's a fun game nevertheless.

We found the variant to be enjoyable where you only can play on the opponent's side if you have finished your own side. This may have been the designer's original rules, I think.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Now this 2 player gets the mix right between helping yourself and hurting the other. Sometimes it can result in too much confrontation (for a perfect wife game) but we are able to keep it as part of the game. 

Sometimes the end game gets weird, with the game petering out just because the cards and the cubes colors are not matching up and you have to discard and discard and finally get one card you can play, but it hurts you to play it. This keeps the game from being any higher than an 8 even though I really love to play it.

RATING: 10
Fun when using the variant that any tile w/ 2 gray cubes gets wiped and reallocated. Otherwise, it's too easy for a tile to get locked down for way too long. Or worse, when two tiles are locked down that way! Oy!

Endgame is fascinating! For such a simple game, the timing and coordination one must muster when taking cups is advanced. You have to make sure when taking cups you don't generate enough wild cubes in the other player to win better/multiple cups that make you lose. Ingenius!

Thank you, BGG, for bringing this little gem to my attention. Otherwise, I would have thought that it was just another unremarkable game in the Kosmos 2-player series. The game feels a bit like Lost Cities (another game that I like), but a little more advanced (little less gambling, little more decision making) - and therefore a little better. Very easy to explain, little downtime, nice tension. One of my girlfriend's favourites!
UPDATE: After not having played the game for some years, I dropped the score 1.5 points after my play today. Seems that games have gotten a lot better since its release and I find that I now have many of the better games in my collection. The strange 3-for-1 rule makes for some extreme rubberbanding.

My son Noah decided to bid with his own money, after placing a bid with the explanation I was bidding on the behalf of my son, was quickly rewarded with a message stating the game was mine with my sons first bid (even though it was well below the BIN price).  Then I was blown away when the seller stated that he was shipping immediately via 2nd day air and he was covering the charges,....WOW.  Thank you to everyone who makes this such a great community and thank you to teh sellers generosity...

Balloon Cup is a good 2-player game but do not let its innocuous theme fool you! This game is quite cut throat and backstabbing!  Not really a game for the faint-hearted or for sensitive significant others. While this game is heavy on luck, I cannot recommend it any more than a 7 due to its "high conflict" status.

Definately high conflict. Interrupting opponents flight is a must to win games.

I am also disliking the 3:1 cube trade ratio. The sudden turn of events sometimes depend on luck especially if claiming a trophy causes a recursive event.

4/10/10 : Dropped the ratings by a full point and a half to 4. This game is rapidly dropping out of my radar. The 3:1 cube trade is ruining the game. Too many inconsistencies. Putting it up for trade.

Played once, but we had some key rules wrong: (1) after scoring a tile, the player who lost that tile/contest gets the next turn (i.e. if you make a play so that your opponent wins cubes, you get another turn - this seems a subtle but important point); (2) *any* player can use the 3:1 exchange to claim a trophy, not just the winner in the traded color.
Would have to play again to form a useful opinion of this game.

Straight forward 2-player card game in a similar vein as Schotten-Totten and Lost Cities. The hot air balloon race theme is pasted-on but it's not intrusive. Works well for what it is - I played with the variant rules for card placement where one side has to play one card more in a color than the opponent to be able to play on the other side. I prefer Schotten-Totten, which I rate a 10, but Balloon Cup is fine for a slight change of pace.

Well, it's pretty straightforward to play, I'll give it that. I won't say that it's all luck, as there are definitely meaningful decisions, and I can look back at the end of a game and think "oh, I should've done X differently"...but there aren't nearly enough for my tastes. It's really difficult to plan ahead, since you need cubes to win and you have little idea for most of the game when the cubes you need are going to come out.

That said, the game strikes me as being made by a card counter for card counters. If you're good at that and enjoy it, this will probably be up your alley. I'm personally bad at it and don't enjoy it, so it felt more random than it probably actually is.

This game felt a lot more mean than I was expecting a short, light, two player card game to feel. Piñata is supposed to have some rule changes (namely only being able to play balloons on your opponent's side once you're full up) that seem like they'd make the game nicer, so I'd like to play with those rules at some point. However, I'm not dying to get this game back to the table, it was okay and it falls under the category of short games that just don't get played in this house. I think there's more strategy here than I'm giving it credit for (much like Lost Cities), but I just don't think I'd ask to play it.

Pleasant and straightforward filler for two players that has a similar feel to Lost Cities. On your turn, you place a card on either your side or your opponent's side. In doing so, you're trying to gain cubes in the middle of the table. Collecting those cubes will allow you to gain trophies. The first player to get to three trophies, wins. It has a relatively high luck factor, but so does Lost Cities.

Nice 2 player game with a mix of randomness, strategy, and simplicity. I can play with my fiance and we both enjoy the game. My geekbuddy igloo cool feels he has no control over what happens, but I beg to differ on that one as you need to plan your moves and learn to give up on some of the hops to open up new cubes...

Probably my favorite game specifically designed for two players.  The strategy is simple -- play good cards on yourself and bad cards on your opponent -- but the rules are so streamlined that games play quickly and rarely feel like they're dragging.

Two player interactive card game to take tricks that match random number of color combinations for highest or lowest value. The theme is not important to this game. Clever, simple little game that is engaging. Great game for camping.

Balloons in different colors! And little wooden cubes in different colors! Okay, pretty simplistic game, but it plays fast, and is not too complicated. Probably best for the little kiddies (but not so little that they would eat the aforementioned colored cubes.)

Once we got the rules down properly, it has turned into a nice, quick, light game.  Not a huge amount of choices, especially if you only have one or two cards that you can play.  We use the designers original rules, this avoids having bad cards played on your side before even getting a shot at the tile.

I wanted to purchase this when it first came out, but held back and I can't remember why.  Recently acquired it in a trade and enjoy playing it with my husband and kids.  Dislike getting stuck with way too many colored cards that are unusable because there aren't any matching cubes to play them to.  We also play with a changed rule - if you cannot play a card, you can discard and draw up to 4 cards, but your turn ends there.  When we played with the original rule (after drawing new cards, if you can play a card, do so) it totally flipped the game for us - made it too easy for me to come back and totally blew it all for hubby.

Can drag on sometimes, at other times moves quickly.  Still like the game and gets played often enough.

My version of the rules may be defective.  I keep looking for the line where it says that it's hard to win without drawing the cards you need at just the right time.  It's in there somewhere, right?

Played several times. This one has been surprisingly enjoyable to me, I don't really know why. It is simple (but not too trivial), the components are nice, and it is short enough. Not the greatest of 2p games, but a pleasant one.

Nice very light two player game. Lots of luck but some strategy, and it can be a nice way to spend time. Feels a lot like Lost Cities but without the math during the scoring phase.

Edit: After my 4th play, I'm liking this more. When played with Stephen Glenn's (the designer's) preferred rules, there are some very tense and tricky decisions. Still lots of luck, but also plenty to think about so you won't get bored.

I just like this one a bit better, as you can place cards for your opponents.

All times I have played this it has poured buckets of one color and absolute droughts of others. I wish I had this problem in 'Lost Cities'. Otherwise I suppose it is an okay game. Won't kill me to play it again. EDIT: It may not kill me but it still hurts to play. I can't find a reason to like this game, fortunately my GF's copy is two states away.

Luck is just too big a factor. After losing the initial races because I did not draw the cards to do anything about it, my luck turned around and I got all the 1's and 13's I needed. Plays were fairly obvious.

I enjoy this game so far.  I can see that it is important to plan ahead so that you aren't stuck later in the game.  There is quite a bit to this but it isn't that difficult to understand either.

Any game that I can play with my 12 year old daughter pleases me, and this is quite a hit with her. I've also played with another gamer and enjoyed it. A somewhat light seeming game. Not sure if it has any hidden strategic depths or just "thinks" it does. But hey, it's a fun card game, physically portable and quick 'n' easy to teach. All good things. I VERY much prefer playing with the designer's original rules rather than the published ones.

The best Kosmos 2-player game aside from LOTR: The Confrontation.  Easy to setup and play, great for beginners but fun for serious players.  I'm usually not one for such simple, abstract games, but I can't get enough of this one.  (We do play with motified rules though...the original rules seem too luck-based).

RATING: 3
Strategy is just figuring out what card is the most optimal to play in a situation through some card counting and min/maxing. Once you have figured that out, it just becomes a game of pure luck. No tension at all. Weird 3-1 rule makes for unexciting endings. Game system is flawed too, can lock up or bog down. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A light game that has some strategy, but still relies on the luck of the draw and a bit of card counting (knowing that there are only 5 grey cards, but 13 red, etc). Some chance of lockout, but not much - more likely to occur if used as a tactic by one player.
Enjoy playing it as a filler, and even my wife likes it...

RATING: 5
As far as 2-player titles go, this isn't a bad one.  I appreciate the hand management aspect, but the rest of the gameplay feels very straightforward and void of any real strategy.  Fortunately we did not experience the dreaded lock-up, but there were a few times when a hop or two took forever to resolve simply because we could not draw the appropriate color.  Didn't really care for the 3-1 cube trading rule, but then again what can you do with the useless ones?

I would really like to try this with the variant where you can't play on your opponent's side until your side is finished.  It's mathy and abstract, but a fun 2-player filler.  Update: I don't like this as much as at first.  There are too-obvious choices and a lot of it comes down to the luck of the draw.  Too bad; I *really* wanted to like this.

We broke the game on our first play! There are only seven blue cards. Our hops had two blue, two blue, one blue, and one blue, respectively. All seven blues were on the table, and the only five valid plays were blue. The rules do not address this. On the other hand, some seasoned players boggled as they came to realize it was possible, so we must have just beaten the odds. Still, it was a game-abortion.

Now, to see what the ruling is on that apparently unusual situation that can actually be created several ways....  Found it:  [thread=322267][/thread]

This has a little more 'take that' than my wife prefers.  So, with her, it is a game of trying not to overtly screw over your opponent.  Very different with the other people I've played it with.

I don't like it as much as other two-player card games (Battle Line, Lost Cities, or Odin's Ravens), but it is fun in it's own little way.

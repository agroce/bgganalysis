RATING: N/A
It's like Cat Jenga!

Well, kind of. It's just the stacking side of Jenga, with no cat-removal, you have to stack all of your cats without knocking over the tower. A die roll each turn determines whether you stack the cats normally or upside-down, or draw a token with some special power on (which then gets added, instability-inducingly, to the tower).

It's a fun filler, but I imagine probably works better with more people (as the tower will be less stable). Unfortunately, random luck could mean that none of the interesting parts of the game occur, in which case the game is more or less a foregone conclusion. In a two-player game this happens too-often, unfortunately.

Fun dexterity game but very little skill involved, unlike other dexterity games I've played. Very, very lighthearted but good fun - a drinking game in disguise! And, to be honest, this probably gets a bonus point rating for  featuring cats. Overall, the game is built so much around luck it's hard to take seriously - but it's still a lot of fun. Rating is fairly low due to how little there is to explore in the game.

Quick and easy dexterity game. Dice offer some variability, but add a hazard to the tower when roll. Components are cute and whimsical, and work great for the experience. The card stock used tends to unbend slowly when stacked high, which offers unique challenges for older players, but could be frustrating for younger cat stackers.

Cat Tower is a better game on paper than it is in play.  The biggest flaw here being the components.  While excellent feeling and looking, the cat cards seem to not work properly as they slide all over the place after placement.  Too bad really as there could be a lot to like here were it not for these issues.

Update:  After receiving some tips from the designer on how to make the components work better, we've given this one another go.  It's pretty good and definitely works a lot better now with less sliding.

RATING: 2
So...is this a game? I really wanted to give this a "1", but I reserve that for activities that masquerade as games (War, Bingo, Chutes & Ladders, etc.). Everything you do is decided by a die roll or a token flip, so I thought, "Okay, this isn't a game. There are no decisions." But then it has a dexterity element. Even though you have no say over what you add to the stack, you do have to use some skill and thought in how to place the wobbly, ever-unfolding crappy cards onto the tower. So, I decided I needed to give it a "2", but I'm still not convinced this is a game. Whatever it is, it is frustrating, boring, pointless, and an utter waste of time.

Played a demo copy where the cards had simply worn out and so you really couldn't stack things, everything just slid off even at 4-5 cats high. This might take a few plays before it becomes an issue, but compared to the game Rhino Hero, this failed to hold up and it seems the design of bending the cards down doesn't hold up well over time.

This is okay, but the double bend on the cards meant that the library copy we used had a few of the cards 'ruined' because people had struggled to bend them without putting dents in the sides of the bends and making the top of the cat unstable.

I prefer Rhino Hero as the cards are simpler to bend and the powers are more interesting.

Rips off the Tier Auf Tier "roll die then place 1-2 piece(s)" system, except here we're using bent cardboard pieces, and all pieces are added to the one tower. Which is inherently unstable given the nature of bent cardboard pieces. If it falls on your turn, bad for you, keep 2 pieces, because the winner is the first to get rid of their 7 pieces. As such, this is standard dexterity fluff, which is nearly always fun for what it is, but I prefer playing with higher quality components found in other games of this ilk.

A dexterity game with some fiddly tokens and some unclear rules about who takes how many cards when the tower topples over. Also with the cards we had it was really easy to topple over the cards. And putting the fatty catty tokens on the tower itself seemed kind of silly and unnecessary as well.

Rhino Hero seems like a more streamlined and interesting version of this game, and its towers get much higher and crazier, so I would much rather play that instead of this game.

RATING: 8.5
Breezy, well integrated theme about the economy of the Vanuatu islands, with a vicious somewhat original placement mechanism and a multitude of ways to score points.

The goal is of course to score the most points during a set number of rounds.  Each round, you select a character which grants you a rule-bending ability- the catch is that you cannot select this character for the next round.  You then place bidding tokens on a series of actions for the round; this is where things can get interesting/dirty...once placement is done, evaluation of actions takes place.  You can only take an action if you're in majority there, but depending on turn order, depending on what other players choose to do, an action may open up for you to take or it may not.  You can walk a very thin razor's edge here potentially to get alot of actions (or very few or none!) or you can play it conservatively and gain only a few actions.

The actions are comprised of such things as: finding treasure (endgame points), fishing, selling fish (gain income, which can also be converted to points in a tricky timed tradeoff) building huts (costs "big" money, but useful for potential big end game points, for selling fish for money, and for gaining direct income), drawing in the sand (straight points), transporting tourists (for immediate income and end game scoring), "resting" (gain tiny bit of points and/or money or go first), move your ship (costs money but very important at times), buy goods which ship for points (costs money but generally very worth it).

An important and thematic aspect of the game is that money is tight and not "valued" by the locals.  So what happens is that if you obtain too much money, your money total "wraps", scoring you nice points (good) but leaving you cash-strapped (bad).  There is generally a decided advantage to going first, and as well there is a minor tile-laying aspect to the game as you build the board (the start player chooses, within limits, how the board will develop).  Gameplay works well for all ranges that I've played (only 2-3, but I imagine it being good but brutal for 4-5).

This is a very, very solid design, euro gamer's game with an solid theme, decent components, good scalability, and some pseudo-innovative ideas and mechanics that all mesh very well together.  A real bitch to be able to find a copy though (don't get me started on the whole Indiegogo thing...), but if you can grab one!

Own a homemade version of the [boardgame=121215]Governor[/boardgame] promo tile (which was supposed to be included in my indiegogo order!), and STILL waiting for my [boardgame=121025]Rising Waters[/boardgame] expansion, again not received from my indiegogo order!

This is quite a heavy Euro-game with some clever innovation but very cut-throat gameplay. It induced some serious AP in one or two players in the game I played, which added to the frustration that built over subsequent turns of shafting by more experienced players. But I can see the appeal. The mechanics are well thought out and the theme is nicely integrated. This is definitely one for gamers only.

RATING: 7
2 plays / 3,5 players (DUPLICATE ENTRY, NOT SURE WHY TWO ENTRIES)

LIKE: The core of the game is the action selection phase, which I really enjoyed. It's a great mechanism, as itself. I liked how the board became competitive as resources shrunk from round to round. I liked how players had to choose specific strategies that combined with the special powers.

DISLIKE: When a player's action is blocked, they get nothing, and a possibility a player could get to take zero actions in a round. This hurt every player several times and the one who was blocked the least won. There are also kingmaking aspects in this game. At times there were action spots that were useless, such as the treasure spot when no treasures were available, which felt odd.

OVERALL: The game is a mean worker placement, but if players can accept that everyone will be treated poorly, the game is pretty good. It also plays better at 3 plpayers. Sometimes the competition is fun. On the other hand, I am not a big fan of getting NOTHING on a blocked turn, I wish they would have designed the game to be a little softer, say, getting a fish for being blocked.

Strangely, the game makes me think of Steam.

It's good, but very mean. And challenging - it's difficult to do exactly what you want, so you need to roll with what your opponents are doing - and plan around opportunities rather turn tactics. However, it's also good to have long term plans. Over all, very tense and challenging in a good way - I like it.

Love the theme as something different. This is one of those games where I stare at the board with my head in my hands while I try to puzzle out the myriad chain reactions that will spin out from my choice of actions. A real pressure-cooker. Top-shelf gaming.

Lovely in its frustration. Good and competitive. Best on 4 so far. 5 is just chaotic but I prefer that to 3. 3 still good. Slow game with my group (though it shouldn't be) and it is not a game that is interesting enough to play for more than 1.5h. Hopefully we can cut playing time alot which will have it making the table more often.

A good game that plays in a reasonable time and has a lot of player interaction. The tiles laying, sailing and sand paintings too act another dimension physically on top of just a standard work replacement game meeples. Downside is it needs of a minimum of 3 but plays better the closer it gets to the max of 5. Player interaction can have direct negative effects in game too and thus playing with people who get offended easily should be avoided too.

A worker placement game where victory points are easier to come by than the money that runs the system.

The limited placement of island severely limits the game replayability. The types of island and sea tiles also limits the strategy that may be more entertaining over a few plays.

Perhaps one of the plus point is that it plays easily for most beginners. With the tile limitations, more plays would and could be strategized along that knowledge of which tiles comes after which turn.

Good initial game.....limited severely after that.

Wonderful game with a ton of interesting tension in 'betting' on actions with your action markers. 

The skeleton of attempting to squeeze your way into executing the actions you want really drives the game. The variable character powers you select each round and the actions themselves complement that skeleton well. The artwork and design are also quite delightful. An overall mechanically and aesthetically pleasing Euro.

I like Vanuatu's high screwage action selection mechanism quite a lot.  The game built around it is unusually thematic for a Euro, aided by some very pleasing artwork.  What keeps this game short of a stellar rating for me is that there isn't actually a great deal to do with those actions.  What's more, the game doesn't develop; you're doing the same things on turn eight as on turn one.  If Vanuatu played in an hour these things wouldn't be a problem, but it doesn't.

RATING: 7.5
A really good action-selection mechanism where you jockey for who can take actions based on number of discs placed and turn order. Tight money, several ways of getting victory points, can be brutal, but everything came together well for me on my first play which tends to endear one to a game. Like it a lot and hope to play again.

RATING: 5.9
I thought about buying this.  I'm SO glad that I didn't.  I was start player on the first turn an got screwed so badly that I had no first turn, no useful second turn, was effectively done for the game before taking an action and really only play 6 rounds while everyone else got to play 8 rounds.  There was no way, in a five player game, for me to do anything other than spend the next hour and a half trying to get up to third (I didn't come close, although I took fourth from someone else who got screwed in the midgame so badly that they just gave up).  Screwage is fine (and often fun) but being out of it that early on with no chance to get back into the game - without other all of the other players making major errors - is just flat out broken in my opinion.  It's a shame because apart from being broken in this way it's a really clever fun game.

If you are looking for a fun to play variation on the standard worker placement mechanic, then this game really fills that need.  First time playing it, we played with 5 seasoned worker placement gamers, and we had a great time with it.  

It plays as a well designed player prediction and VP optimization challenge.  With seasoned gamers, the game is likely to be won by the player who makes the fewest mistakes, and mistakes are tough to avoid, which is part of the fun of the game.

Notably in a five player game, to really make this game enjoyable, and more tractable, the game rules should probably encourage players to place their workers ABOVE the action boxes they desire, then dynamically re-arrange in a line trailing upward from the action box, any workers already placed for that action box, in player turn order (thus showing with that line of workers leading upward from the box, the present action priority for that action box), and of course, whenever a player has MORE workers than other players for that action box, place that players workers "ahead" of the other players fewer workers in that line of present priority for that action.  (Of course, all workers placed above the boxes are considered as wanting to take the action of that box.) 

In this way, the game is better visualized by the players as they consider placing their workers.  Without this, if four or five players just sloppily threw their workers in the small action boxes, it might be tough for players to "see" or "get" the current action orders for each box.  IMHO, visual tractability can make a substantial difference to player enjoyment in a game, and is critical to the enjoyment of the decision making in this game.  September 2014- Giving the game 8 of 10.

November 2014 - After a number of plays, going to raise the rating to a 9.  The worker placement variation in this game is a lot of fun and attempt to solve with player prediction.  For what it aspires to create, this game does it quite well.

Such a cut-throat game.  This can only be played with people who are OK with offending others (think diplomacy).  You can get 100% screwed in this game if you don't plan it correctly and gauge other player's interests.  

It's very easy to get into a pissing match and escalate(a la Taj Mahal) and both players lose because they spend so much to get a particular action, where one gets absolutely destroyed.

After several plays: the action selection mechanism is very clever but also very mean.  Quite tactical: the core of the game is predicting and influencing the unwinding of the action stack.  With 5 this is longer than 90 minutes: we took 3 hours with rules explanation and 5 new players.  This is perhaps the best of the 2011 Essen crop.

RATING: 7
Very direct and 'negative' turn order selection, whereby you may only take an action if you have more counters than other players requiring that action, or are equal but ahead in turn order.  If you can't play then you have to forfeit an action.  My tactic of choosing 4 or 5 different actions paid off as did largely avoiding hut building which the other four, who had played before, considered strong.  My treasures carried the day.  Very nice design with good ideas, role selection and turn order in particular.  You have to start the game knowing that preventing other from having turns is the dominant tactic.  If you can swallow that and enjoyable game.  If not, avoid.  Note to the designer.  The game goes on one round to long.  Less is often more.

Second game with a different group and sadlythe game was not well received, mainly for all the main design ideas that make it great.  Very much an acquired taste.  8>7.

RATING: 8
Vanuatu was one of my favorite games from the 2011 Essen crop.  It gets extra points because it's hard to come by (at least as of this writing) so it has the sheen of the rare find.

Players in Vanuatu are trying to make the most of a very tight economy.  The is an action selection procedure that would be a pretty unimpressive worker placement type thing, except that folds in a spicy "area majority" mechanic on top of it.  The result is a deliciously competitive game that requires careful planning and ample opportunities for screwage.

RATING: 5
Rating based on a single play.

For a middle length worker placement game there are lots of elements to dislike. A player can be put in an unenviable situation when they split workers by having each opponent (after them) compete with one space, or they can do fine by having everyone go into one. It reduces the tactical element to more of a "Can I guess what everyone wants?"

I also dislike how much power the start player has (with tile placement).

And it may have just been first game blues; but 2 hours is too much. For that time I could almost play Caylus.

Rating -- Indifferent leaning towards avoid

RATING: 7.5
The game is fierce! it seems like an innocent euro but too often one faces the choice of destroying another player's full round. By analyzing the meta game, one could conclude that it is rather more profitable to counter whatever hostile actions you can rather than try to simply use your workers for beneficial actions. I do not think the common taste is fit for this kind of vicious interaction.

This game won't enter BGG Top100 for just one reason: it won't be widely available unless reprinted by a major publisher in the US.
And this is a shame, because Vanuatu is something that qualifies as very close to a true masterpiece!
Everything is wonderful from the very beginning: the artwork is simple and straightforward, using pastel tones. The graphic design is so strikingly perfect and "ergonomic" that is unbelievable this game is made by such a small publisher (Krok Nik Douil, I bow before you!).
The rulebook is well written and well translated in every major language (at least I can say that for french, english and italian...)!
The gameplay is compelling, astonishingly interactive, with lots of room for screwage. Everything comes together so nicely I can't really find the words to describe it: Vanuatu is a real gem of a game, possibly the best of Essen 2011!

First Impression: What a brutal game! There is some serious direct player interaction. Having the open bidding mechanism for actions, as well as the role selection makes for an enjoyable game.

Turn order is huge.  It's very easy to plan out a sequence and lose a key action in the sequence.  I'm not a fan of games in which you accomplish little or next to nothing due to no fault of your own.  I'd play again though to give it a second chance.

First Play: An arborted start as we launched in and utterly failed to appreciate the nuances of the turn order. As a result we we screwed from the off and decided to start again.

This is a sublime game. The play order mechanism is one of the most refined I have encountered offering the opportunity to shaft the opposition into losing all of their turns if left to their own devices.

So many ways to score and a need to keep an eye out on how the game develops. Just an absolute joy to play. This will be in my top ten.

Second Play: Its just gets better. The oportunities for diplomacy and screwage are just a joy when combined with the broad possibilities of the game structure. I love this game. If I was ever to offer a 10 for a game rating, this has come closest so far in my gaming life.

And so the plays rack up. So much to look out for, so easy to get pulled in the wrong direction, this is perhaps my favourite game of all time.

This may be the meanest 5 player game I have ever played.  Felt like I was in a knife fight with friends.  Very intense and crowded with 5. A solid game.  Longer play time.

Nothing like a turn where you actually are not able to do anything because of how the other players take their turns.

Fairly involved euro game with several very clever mechanics... money resets to zero when you pass nine and doing that also gives you five points; worker placement to 8 or 9 options where players get to take action where they have the majority and remove their workers from that space as they take the action.  Can me slowly with players prone to AP and I'm not sure it comes together completely as a game, making for a fun time.  But, it is very interesting.

RATING: 9
Really tight economy, and very clever and mean action selection mechanism makes for a tense and great game. My only regret for not getting at Essen. 

I liked this alot. The "mean" interaction is tempered by the restrictions. (You have to do an action if you can. You must choose an action where you have a majority. You may not plan an action unless its possible.) As such, you can still puzzle through your turns, and make sure something good happens. In a way, it's risk management, in that if you go for "too many" options, you might get none, but if you focus on 2, you will probably do them. The actual stuff happening is nothing special, but the planning phase is really interesting.

RATING: 7.5
Solid 7.   

I have only played two player and it was cool.  Turn order meant a lot and how the actions were taken was big.  It was tough.  With three or four, I see this being pretty wild.  Not sure about five...might be too random. But, I think the more people that play, the more ways to score points becomes a factor.

Anyways, I had a good time with this.  It allows you to be creative in your turns (and I like that).  You have to commit more action points if you want to guarantee you being able to take that action, when you want to take it.  In a three or more player game, I can see major screwage and that could be good (or bad).

Jan 2017 - Okay, got to play with four and found it very fun.  Mean mean mean.  You can screw people in losing their turn and that happened to every one of us in this game.  You have to know when to take your shot and it really helps to zig when others are zagging.  Up to a 7.5 as I like this more than average.

Hands down the best game of Essen 2011, and if you don't agree, I will gladly fight you. The cutesy, cartoony graphics (which are excellent) hide a deep, strategy-laden masterpiece with an evil, evil edge. Buckets of player interaction centred around a clever but cut-throat role selection mechanism. Player screwage is ever-present but tactical rather than strategic (picking on another player wouldn't work). Tense, deep and dripping with deliciously difficult dilemmas. A true peach!

An interesting game.  Without the action placement mechanic, it would just be another worker placement game, albeit one with a relatively strong theme.  However, the action placement mechanic makes this a tight, vicious little game that plays well from 2-player to 5-player.  I was actually surprised that I didn't feel the 5-player to be any more tense than the 2-player.  With 2 players, players lose ties to the neutral player (with 1 exception) and the neutral player's action pawns don't go away.  I'm curious now how this would play with 3.  I suspect it may be less tense than the 2-player game. An excellent game.  not my favorite of 2011, but a a very good game with potential for upward movement.

Just played a 3-player game last night and it was indeed much more open than a 5- and a 2- player game.  There was a little bit of messing with each other in the first round (when there wasn't much to do) but for most of the game, everyone was getting (or at least attempting) 4 or 5 actions.  I know there's a suggestion to play without cards 3 player but I'm not sure why it would improve the action selection.

Juego de colocación de trabajadores, en el que para seleccionar una acción para realizar, tienes que ganar la mayoría en esa acción. Cuando la ejecutas, quitas tus piezas de la acción, y las mayorías cambias.. con lo que, la planificación de acciones adquiere una intensidad importante.

Es un juego de reglas sencillas y múltiples formas de obtener puntos de victoria. También incluye tema de selección de roles. Vamos, que en un sólo juego, aglutina unas cuantas mecánicas que han gustado en otros juegos y lo hace con mucha elegancia. Me pareció muy interesante. Por lo visto, en el 2011 fue candidato a juego del año.. y no lo ganó. Después de haberlo jugado (y después de saber que el galardón se lo llevó La Isla prohibida), me parece injusto.

Es un juego muy recomendable. Gustará a los jugones de eurogames, casi seguro. PAra los no jugones, puede resultar algo confuso al principio.

Rating is likely to go up after some more plays. Our first game lasted 3+ hours, which felt a bit overboard, but if we manage to play in 2 hours it will be awesome. Playing without roles speeds up play time and makes things more difficult in general, which is a good thing, imho.

Great first impression. Will likely be the best Essen release of 2011.

Just when you think worker placement has been beaten to death, along comes Vanuatu to make cutthroat euro action selection a tense, engaging and interactive game.

And it comes across as a genuinely thematic game, that is designed around life on Vanuatu. This is not a pasted-on-theme euro that could have taken place anywhere. 

Simply sublime. Bravo.

Update. Five player games are too long and cut throat. Three player games are unbalanced. Vanuatu really should be played as four players only.

We played it incorrectly our first try, so need to play with the right rules.   I found it to be okay, and the competition for actions is a neat mechanic.    However, the game itself seemed very incremental.  It was a series of trade offs between 2 points here and 3 points there.   This is very much a tactical game rather than a strategic one, which is probably why it doesn't excite me more.  Initial rating 7.

An incredibly mean and nasty game that encourages the most passive aggressive and heartless play style I've ever seen in a Euro game. I don't mean that as a compliment. This game is brutal. 

Players often can find their entire rounds wasted because a single player decided to hold their pawns hostage. This only breeds frustration if not outright anger around the table; in our only play all agreed they would never play again. Because as solid as the mechanics are, the game is simply not fun to play, whether you are winning or losing. Too bad, because I like the theme and the look of the game as a whole. Sold.

[thing=104020][/thing] appears to be the cream of this year's Essen crop. The fact that I own the game and yet still played it three times at a convention full of new-to-me titles should be strong evidence of this game's merits.  After my first play (prior to LobsterTrap), I was hesitant to embrace the game. In particular, I was worried about the variety of scoring paths (the one player shut out of tourists early finished well behind the rest). I also had some reservations about the amount of mental processing necessary to play it competitively.  I can now state that those concerns have been put to rest.

The heart of the game is an action-selection mechanism that allows players to choose actions in a worker-placement fashion, but forces players to resolve actions based on area-majority priciples.  Thus players can complete for high-value actions by committing more resources to those spaces, but, in so doing, reduce the total number of actions that they can take each round. The result of this mechanical layering is that players should predict what they are opponents will want to do, and in which sequence, in order to the best manipulate the gamestate to their advantage. This is a mean game, and I would not recommended for players who easily get their feelings hurt or for those who would like to make plans and then execute them. On any given round, you may end up with as few as zero viable options thanks to good play by your neighbors.

I enjoy mean games, however.  And I have now witnessed sufficient variety between my sessions of [thing=104020][/thing] to convince me that multiple strategies are available and viable.  In one game in particular, a player lapped the scoring track during the game (a feat normally reserved for winners during endgame scoring) by eschewing the highly demanded actions in favor of frequent short-horizon points grabs.  

As for my concerns about the taxing mental processing required, I have come to discover that familiarity with the game greatly reduces the amount of processing necessary to compete. In my final game of the weekend, I played a five player session that was over in under the 90 minutes estimated on the side of the box. In this game in particular, the players were sufficiently capable at parsing the incentive structures that one player could almost predict the flow of the round before the first action marker had been placed. I am not naming any names, though. *coughJoeHubercough*  I will also say that  such mental faculties do not guarantee victory. ;)

All in all I quite enjoy this game, despite its unforgiving nature. Most of the players that I spoke with complained that the game was a round too long. I am probably inclined to agree on that score, and I may experiment with a seven-round game (though I worry about throwing off the balance). On the final round, there seemed to be little that players could do. In a well-executed game, the last round may see only two or three of the action spaces at having any utility. That is of course less-then-desirable.

Nevertheless, there is unquestionably a solid game here, and one that I am happy to play and am likely to continue requesting in the near future.  I give the game an [b][BGCOLOR=#00FF99][COLOR=#00FF99]_[/COLOR]8[COLOR=#00FF99]_[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR][/b] at the moment, with some potential for upward mobility. I do not believe, however, that the game will likely hit a [b][BGCOLOR=#00CC99][COLOR=#00CC99]_[/COLOR]9[COLOR=#00CC99]_[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR][/b].

Clever idea to have an election for role selections but, the playing time here is far understated.  AP prone players will have difficulty with the many permutations and possible outcomes.  There is no randomness but, there is player-induced chaos which is determinable but very unstable.

Replayability seems to be an issue because only 9 boardgame geeks have logged more than a dozen plays.  The game is not accessible for casual gamers.

The theme and story of the game carry the day and it is a fun experience but, little strategy is available amongst the chaos as is evidenced by the low replay numbers.

Highly interactive Worker Placement with a bidding mechanic for the worker placement order of actions. Timing is important as resources are scarce in a first come first serve basis. It's a rather excellent game.

RATING: 6
Vanuatu strikes me as something similar to Lancaster or Keyflower in the sense that it's not strictly a "worker placement" game; it's an action bidding game, where there's three round of placing a total of five pawns on 10 various action spaces.

For the first 60 minutes, I was pretty into my first game. But then the 2nd hour... yeah, more of the same. It took 3 hours for our group of five to get through the game. And yes, we tend to be a slow game, but I suspect 90 minutes is too optimistic. Each round is pretty much the same, and there's really no buildup or particular strategy to follow. Eveything is in "the tactical moment" unless I'm missing something.

Update: A new comparison occurred to me last play... It is like a rich chocolate: delicious, satisfying in its complex flavors, but ultimately not a balanced meal.

Previous comment: While I absolutely adore the vicious action selection mechanism, after three plays, I am finding the game itself to be a bit lacking in dynamism. Each turn is the intriguing and quite lovely puzzle that is the 'predictive logistics' of the action track. What do you need to do? When? What about the others? How will the actions unroll? But the repetition is reminiscent of a second rate baroque composer: pretty but ultimately unsatisfying. My 8 rating stays for now just based on the prettiness. But it is likely to go down as the lack of a strategic palette or arc begins to irk me too much.

(btw: played only without the characters)

Really interesting euro.  I like it quite a bit.  When played well, I think this can be a very mean game--which might put some players off.  The action and resource economy is very tight.  

I have a couple of small reservations--namely about the play becoming scripted, but hell, even a scripted game of this is better than most open euros.

This game has a completely awesome, completely confrontational action pawn placement at the beginning of each round. You can only activate and use the space that your action pawn(s) are on IF you have majority of action pawns within that space. After you activate that space, you remove your action pawns, which will then pass majority to another player (provided there are other action pawns remaining in that same space from other players).

It involves a lot of speculation of the order in which other players may resolve their action pawns so that you will have majority when you need it!

It is pure nasty. Pure fun!

I love the auction mechanic to determine what actions will be available this turn.  I also love that you can manipulate your opponent's ability and order in which they execute your actions through blocking.

There are lots of decision points to consider, even in the two player game.  The dummy blocking works well and helps balance the 1st player advantage in tie breakers by giving the second player one more dummy token.

It has only been in my last two plays that we have really started to explore how to effectively maximize your turn.  There are strategic elements, but you must still be tactical in options you can take if your preferred action is taken.

There are a lot of rules, but the flow well once you get into the game, and the notation on the game board gives you most of the information you will need to jump right into a game, even after a prolonged absence.

Oh, don't mind me. I'm just a harmless friendly little game about whiling away the time in a tropical paradise. WRONG! The is one of the most brutal cut-throat games I own. There's a random element from not knowing the tiles that will come out, but given the information for each round, each round is 100% tactical, and you have to be very careful about getting the actions you need/want, in the order you need/want, not just relative to your own actions, but relative to the actions of others. I've never seen an action selection system quite like this, where you don't know the order actions will be resolved in as you put "workers" out. Rating might rise with more plays, but it might just end up being too brutal for the group I typically play with.

RATING: 5
It's been a while since I played this game last, and my memory of it is hazy. A few choice points I do remember:

— The worker placement core is rather cool and surprisingly nasty in doling out opportunity to take scarce actions. This is a trait I've since come to associate with Alain Epron, and as such I find it sad that he left the scene in the way that he did.
— The economy is rather tight, and players are curtailed in many ways. The automatic money-to-VP transformation for example makes stringing together actions even more difficult than it already is. I'm all for making matters difficult, but this feels like an arbitrary restriction because the designer thought he could.
— Unfortunately due to resource constraints it is very difficult to strike out on your own: sailing is prohibitively expensive. Thus Vanuatu appears bereft of localised activity; it's more like a wave of shared construction rolling across the board with players attempting to get to choice spots first every time. This takes a lot away from the game, in my opinion.

There are good ideas in this title, but also a few bad ones, and the result is average. I'm willing to play again, but that's about it.

Length was an issue, especially when you've counted the points and you are in no way in contention. Mean, but controlled meanness. Gaining five actions is not possible. In the only game I've played Andy gained four actions in one turn, which turned his game around. Need to perform different actions as other people or desire to preform the same actions but on different places of the map.

RATING: 4
Good production, but strange that the board is half English, half French. 

Gameplaywise, I would have to say that it is not my cup of tea. I find it too chaotic. What I mean is that it is too easy to find your plans fall through due to the actions of other players.

In this game, actions spaces you place markers on may not (and likely won't) take effect. Now, in many other worker placement games, you might be able to then use that marker somewhere else, in perhaps a less-desirable action space. Not so in this one (it goes back unused--sorry). Even the Provost mechanic in Caylus is more forgiving in that a player knows the parameters of how likely he will be able to use that action (the Provost can only move 3 spaces in either direction) and even spend money to increase his chances. In Vanuatu, players don't have these parameters or options to manipulate the chances. Furthermore, losing one worker's action in Caylus is only one of possibly six. Whereas in Vanuatu it is one of (at most) three! 

On top of this, most of the actions chain off each other. So, even if you do not get blocked from an action by other players having a majority there, you may be forced to remove your marker without doing the action because you were not able to complete an action that was necessary prior to that one. For example, I may not have been able to do the Fishing action [i]before[/i] I did the Sell action. So, by missing out on the Fishing action, even if I had a majority on the Sale action (and ability to conduct it), I still must remove my marker unused--I have no fish to sell!

So, it ends up being a game where you cannot plan much for anything. You spend a turn doing part of what you had planned, and the next, you are blocked from completing the next step of that plan, thereby wasting your entire turn.

While I am impressed with the components, I find the gameplay to be too chaotic. And I am a gamer who does not cringe away from direct conflict, but it was just too much even for me in this game. 

Update: Played a 3-er, and found it a little less frustrating, but still too much multi-player chaos for me.

The game involves traveling throughout a small group of islands and making different uses of resources like fish, treasure, beef, markets, etc.

However, the way actions are selected is innovative and clever. It is highly interactive and requires excellent planning to keep from having your chosen actions negated or lessened by how the other players choose their actions. (It's also frequently possible to change the order of your actions so that you deny someone else or sneak in a surprise action of your own.)

It's not exactly worker placement, but it's not exactly bidding for actions, either. Whatever it is, though, it's great.

This game is definitely a eurogame... but in no way is it multi-player solitaire. You will get your toes stepped on and you'd better be prepared to step on some toes.

The official 2-player variant even works very well!

Interesting majority action selection game, featuring a really clever/too fragile system for the attribution of actions. Highly interactive, yet too unpredictable. 

The overall feeling is that you can get screwed almost by chance (or by the chaos induced by player choices), and the winner is not always the best player.

Really love playing this, especially with four or five players. The action selection process has fantastic player interaction -- you can really mess up someone's plans for the round, or vice versa, and the steps you take to avoid getting diverted mean you may miss out on bigger opportunities. That aspect of gameplay keeps us coming back.

I really disliked the action selection method in this one.  Being denied the action totally because of how the order of play worked out is too painful.  Reminds me of the blocking in Hansa Teutonica.

RATING: 4
As others have said, the action selection mechanic is clever and sounds interesting however, link it to severely restricted resources and money supply, which curtail the useful actions for all players and you get a pretty cut-throat, brutal game where screwage is the order of the day and individual players can be knocked out of contention at an early stage of the game.

This wouldn't be a problem if the game was short, but it runs quite long (2.5-3 hours), or if the theme generated an exciting experience, but it doesn't - this is just a dry Euro VP chase with some attractive Pacific Island scenery.

No game narrative, no fun and somewhat unpleasant.

This rating is probably very unfair as I have only played two rounds of one game, but I have seldom experienced anything like the instant dislike of the action selection method in this game. Hate is probably a better word.

RATING: 7
Interesting game where area-control meets worker placement.  You place your "workers" on an action but don't take the action until all workers are placed (Caylus style).  However, the rub is that spaces can have many workers from multiple players.  Each player takes turn selecting one action to exectue.  However, only the player with the most workers on the action can execute the action.  Only then does it become available for the player with the 2nd most workers.  Our 1st play was fairly close.  Looking forward to another play.

RATING: 7
Players try and make a living on the islands of Vanuatu.  Simple, yet devious game.  Players draft a special "helper" character for the turn, then take turns drafting actions by putting out five action disks in the order 2/2/1.  Players then take those actions ONLY if they hold a majority of disks on that action at the time.  Almost Knizia-esque, reminiscent of the Taj Mahal withdrawal majority mechanic.  Just like Taj Mahal, timing is everything and if you get greedy you could get nothing.  Actions allow you to move around the islands, fishing, building, diving, creating sand art, loading ships, and so on.  It's all about earning money, and prestige points, over 8 turns.  Silky smooth, deep, tough, and rather delightful.  Tons of potential to screw others over, deliberately, or simply via collateral damage.  Very good.

Very, very cool worker placement game which is much more vicious than it's artwork or theme would suggest. The idea of forcing the players to have majority on an action space in order to perform it transforms the regular worker placement experience into quite the cutthroat gameplay. Add to this the chaining of actions and you have a game that, while it can lead to analysis paralysis, is extremely interactive.
Highly recommended

Acchittato i vari tavoli, apro e defustello Vanuatu fresco di consegna. 
Il gioco l'ho provato due volte a Ludica e tocca a me spiegarlo... ed ecco l'ansia da prestazione-spiegazione. Ma credo di essermela cavata egregiamente e velocemente, senza tralasciare quasi nulla (il conteggio di alcuni punti finali l'ho detto al secondo turno  Embarassed ). 
Al tavolo io, Scalper, Matteo (che non mi ricordo il nick), Daniele collega di Matteo e Massimo (che non conosco il nick). 
Bella partita, gioco bastardissimo, ma al tavolo ci sono giocatori tosti e ci si insulta ad ogni turno! ahahahahahah 
Peccato che Scalper non era in forma e ha sempre navigato il mare della confusione...

[b][FirstPlayOn26thMay2014][/b] This game is really gorgeous to look at but don't be deceived by it. It can be a mean game especially if all players are trying to hurt each other. You can get screwed easily and pretty badly in this game when someone interrupts the sequence of your actions.

On your turn, your perform an action where you have a simple majority (where you have more action disc on an action space, or you are higher in turn order if you are tied in the number of action discs). Having no majority forces you to remove all your discs in an action space, thus forfeiting that action. Very simple mechanic, but can turn out to be mean in execution. 

I think it's a great game. I enjoyed my one play so far and hope to get to play it again soon. Love how everything looks in the game!

I consider Vanuatu to be your average decent euro. Probably a bit better than average when you consider what my average game ratings are. What does it have going for it? 

-It has wonderful graphic design/artwork
-It has a unique action drafting component
-There is a character drafting portion which can enhance actions if you aren't blocked from them
-There is positional play as your move you boats to the various hexes
-Resources and opportunities diminish as time marches on.

Some people have said that this was a pretty confrontational/brutal game. This is based on getting blocked in actions and money has a cap where you lose your money if you go above the cap. There is a VP consolation prize for going above the cap but it's pretty inefficient compared to what you could have used the money for. My 1st play of this was with 4 and the character cards. It didn't seem overly bad to me as I was never blocked from my actions once in the whole game. I wasn't even screwed by the order of the resolution in the game. I also didn't unintentionally go above the money cap the whole game, but came close once. If people think this is confrontational/brutal, they really need to play Age of Steam. Despite all the characters and such, I think this would feel a little samey after 5 or so plays.

A clever, albeit very dry action efficiency game with devastating consequences. I can appreciate a game where I need to squeeze out tiny efficiencies over other players but it fell flat with my group because it felt too long. 

You're going to get knocked out of actions at some point, but if you fall too far behind there's not too much you can do to get back into the game. Once you fall off the track of efficiency, it's awfully hard to climb back on and when people have to sit through another hour of that, it can feel more hopeless than challenging.

One 3p game. Cool game. The worker placement/bidding is a unique twist that can take a little getting used to, but it's quite good. Yes, there's a screwage element but it's not too overwhelming. Zero luck and a very tight economy, yet everyone is fighting the same struggle and there's enough opportunities to make a decent go of things regardless of how you end up, and there are chances for a comeback. I also felt the final score spread was good and well represented the relative effort/skill of the players. 

I can see the game being much more competitive with 4 or 5 and playing rather differently. With 3 there was enough room to spread out and semi-turtle successfully. 

I was fully engaged the whole game and would be happy to play again.

Did not like. Very long, very fiddly, very little you can do and you very little you get to do! So many turns of players simply failing to be able to take a planned action. That was the intention of the design, but it made for a very frustrating exercise. And we finished tied for 1st place and 3rd place only 2 VPs behind! After all that and only two points in it, not in a good way! Aaaargh! Very annoying.

RATING: 8.5
After two plays with three players:
Yes, it’s tactical, including in how carefully you have to plan, and potentially reevaluate, the placement of your action tokens. It is after all the heart of the game. Yes, the game can be mean, and potentially very frustrating, because of how actions are (or are not) played. But the potential for blocking is part of the fun!

The role selection is another key mechanism that plays out in interesting ways. And you do indeed have multiple paths to victory, though how the board gets built can easily force you to reevaluate your overall strategy. Buildings-and-tourists seems to be a critical component to victory, if only because the economics of the game are generally so restrictive, but I can see how the right tile distribution throughout the game could offer someone a Guide and Fisherman route to victory, for example. Or goods and boats, which can reap huge point gains if played well.

It’s neither a short nor a simple game, but at the same time I found the gameplay to be fluid and was never bored. What takes time is thinking through the implications of player order, then role choice, then action token placement, then in what order you pull those tokens back off the board. But I never felt like there was an AP problem in our plays. In fact, I could see someone criticize the game for how constrained your choices are by the choices of the other players — for example the third-of-three players is generally going to have only one or two worthwhile roles from which to choose. And you could also argue that once you’ve chosen what actions you want to play, you know how you want to place your tokens, what role you want to choose, and in what order you want to play. Yes, that necessarily means you’re planning a turn ahead, but again once you’ve decided on a points strategy for a given tile distribution, you already have a decent sense of what you’re after.

So I’ll grant people that it’s think-y and kind of stressful, but I found it engaging (and not un-thematic, by the way — everything integrates nicely) and kept me thinking about it the next day, which surprised me. I suspect I like how the tactical nature of the gameplay keeps strategy in check, which in turn means so long as players are staying on top of things there will be a tight score spread in the end. But we clearly knew how and why the wins were obtained, even if my win in our second game came as a small surprise only because I thought my end-game wasn’t strong enough to pull it out. Also, I would think that without the roles the game would be drier and a bit more of a grind, but then maybe it’s worth a try. I don’t see this as a game you play every weekend, despite it getting better with more plays I’d bet, but one of the other two players said ‘it has its place in a game collection’ and I agree.

Update: With time I keep thinking back to this game, wanting to give it another whirl, and so I've raised its rating by 0.5. It didn't surprise me to see that it was reprinted, especially given the bizarre saga that apparently was the original printing.

One of my few blind purchases during my gamer's life (just had a 30 min look at a game being played at Essen 2012)
Love it.
Downgraded from 8.5 in Oct. 2013: I have to admit, that the unforgivingness if you make mistakes can be quite a bit frustrating ;-)

While it was fairly obvious at first glance that the action selection mechanic is very clever, I was a little sceptical how well it would actually work as a game. Other players can deprive you of your actions, and if you never actually got to do anything it probably wouldn't be much of a game after all.

It turns out those reservations were uncalled for. Yes, it is possible to action-starve opponents and it sometimes even happens without malicious intent, yes, it is one mean mechanic, and yes, it is quite confrontational and you should be aware that this isn't for everyone. But it does work very well indeed (except maybe with just 3 players, although that is largely a concern with the map).

The action selection mechanic makes Vanuatu an unusually interactive game when thinking in standard Eurogame terms.

RATING: 5
This is perhaps a relatively low rating just because I'm not very good at the game, but I found it unforgiving.  If you have a plan and miss one thing (and there are lots of things to miss), it can cause a chain reaction where you effectively wind up with 0 actions for a whole round.  If you study enough and think hard enough, I suppose you can avoid those sorts of things, but games that essentially force people to play slow and engage in AP are not generally that much fun.

Quite a nicely developed auctioning mechanic for actions where players compete with limited auction tokens. Players can get easily screwed, but that's where the tension comes in. I normally like auction games and while I liked this mechanic I was somewhat cool to the rest of the game. Sometimes it felt uninspired and other times it felt clunky. I just didn't find that the game built around the action auction mechanic jelled together for me. Can't really put my finger on it but I found the auction (though tense at times) at other times not very exciting. I found the execution of the actions quite boring. And a game like this should not be allowed a window of opportunity for AP! Yeah. Just sort of a bummer, man.

This is a very good game - well designed, well produced, works as intended, but it really is not the sort of game I want to play.

Excellent resource management game with a unique action selection mechanism (if you don't have simple majority you don't get to do the action you want), making for a fun competitive atmosphere (maybe too competitive for some). I really like how the very limited resources in the game forces you to optimize well, and the board art is gorgeous.

Very interesting mechanics! An overflowing mix of interlinked interesting mechanics! Too much mechanics!

Still, an interesting game that I'd agree to play again sometime.

Enjoyed it on Boitejeaux some so tried a two player variant, where half of the roles are not available each round and using an 8 sided dice to place a dummy player.  This made it playable but not an enjoyable experience overall and the cutthroat nature of the action selection mechanism was not good as a couple's game.

Despite the ambientation, this is a pure german game, with a good system for majorities to choose actions. Lots of interaction for a a very funny game.

After some games: it's almost unplayable with different level players. The others players' moves are more important than yours and all becomes random.

RATING: 8
Don't be deceived by the fun-in-the-sun appearance of Vanuatu -- untangling the consequences of action resolution is no vacation. You have to be aware of not only your own step-by-step plans each round, but those of everyone else around the table as well, because if you don't, your best laid plans will be left high and dry.

Money is very tight. Wonderfully so. Screwage, both deliberate and collateral, is ever-present -- don't expect to always be able to carry out every action you had hopes on.

The huts and visiting tourists are exceedingly high sources of end game points, and it's vital that players collectively not allow one person to dominate the one or two best islands with their own huts.

Without the character cards, this game is rough. With the character cards, you add another 30 minutes or so. I'll take rough.

Design quibbles: The action spaces are too small for player markers, the sand drawing icons are too faint, the bank track is clunky and should be replaced by simple money counters or chips.

Feels like a very good mix of Kaivai-lite with a touch of Vasco da Gama irregular action resolution ordering.

First fame with four experienced gamers took a little over four hours. We could probably get this down to around three hours after a couple of games more. None of us could see how this can be finished in 90 minutes - that's about ten minutes per round, so each player would have about two and a half minutes in which to select and carry out their five potential actions.

The second game came in at 140 minutes, and there were only four of us.

"A modern example of a disguised ‘miss your turn’ mechanism is found in Vanuatu. This is a miserable, hateful, game where the object is to be in a position where other players waste less of your time than others. This action selection game is designed so that the player interaction results in your situation where your selections are rendered meaningless and just to rub it in, leaves you in a position where it can happen again on the next turn. Who play-tested this? Sociopaths? The winner is the person who actually gets to play the game the most, rather than being rendered a spectator."

My friend Mary Tomaszewski summarized Vanuatu perfectly in her brief ratings comment:

"I felt like every turn was the last turn of a game where you have nothing good left to do."

Vanuatu is an extremely sparse, tight game of few resources and thin margins for error. That brutal, starved landscape is Vanuatu's weakness, or its strength, depending on your gaming preferences. For me, it's a bit of both. I trade the game away after two plays. Neither group was enthusiastic about the game, and there were a couple of features that bothered me:

(1) There really is not enough to do in Vanuatu. It seems like everything happens too slowly, in tiny chunks that feel unsatisfying. Each turn, even the players who get the good stuff, don't do much. The players who don't get the good stuff, well, they do even less....

(2) Sometimes who gets the good stuff and who doesn't get the good stuff seems to have little to do with who played well. The clever action selection/bidding system is perhaps a bit too clever. It's extremely fragile. Most of the players may have everything planned out perfectly, but then that one person who didn't think things through makes a boneheaded move, and it ends up totally wrecking some players' turns and handing an undeserved bounty to other players. This kind of thing doesn't usually bother me in other games, but it can completely wreck a game of Vanuatu because the action selection structure is like a house of cards.

Clearly a good game, but I don't enjoy playing it due to Analysis Paralysis.

------------------

Played a partial 3 player demo game at PAX 2012.  It had interesting mechanics, particularly for picking who gets to take a given action first, but it didn't truly captivate me.

I don't like that there isn't a way to get big points through careful play, you seem to just eke out a few points with each good move.  (Granted, you could claim that Agricola has no massive point moves, but I like it nonetheless.)

I want to play it again to decide for sure, but this feels like a 6.5 rating - good, but not great.

There are two main branches of worker placement games: the player board–driven games, like [thing=31260]Agricola[/thing], [thing=35677]Le Havre[/thing], and [thing=122515]Keyflower[/thing], and the board-driven games, like [thing=62219]Dominant Species[/thing] and [thing=119432]Snowdonia[/thing]. The former are often conversion-driven (you are exploiting your tableau of resources), the latter spatially driven (you are controlling the board’s areas).

Vanuatu stands at the pinnacle of the latter group. In Agricola, you compete for resources to feed into your conversion engine. In Dominant Species, you compete for the type and specialization of your actions. In Vanuatu, you compete for the order in which you can take your actions—sometimes for the right to take actions at all. In the first game of Vanuatu I saw played, one player in a 3-player game took 0 actions (of 5 possible) her first turn. In spreading herself too thin, she got nothing. And how could she spread herself thin? That’s the magic of Vanuatu.

Playing Vanuatu is like trying to eat a full-course dinner at a revolving sushi bar. And that’s exactly what you have to do. Each round you’ll want to perform a sequence of actions: the more complex the better. Ideally, you spend your five actions building a hut, then fishing, then selling fish, then sailing toward the next island and there diving for treasure. But you don’t do that in Vanuatu, because who would let you? If Jane has more action discs on the hut-building action space (did I mention you could double up? triple up?), then you can’t take your action discs off to build a hut (you can take them off to no effect, and may be forced to) until she takes her action discs off. And if she spends her turns taking off her action discs elsewhere, you’ll be selling your fish to nowhere (you have no hut), leaving you with no money to fuel your movement, and Jesse will scavenge the lion’s share of the treasure you were hoping to plunder first. In the end you get fish.

Turn order is all-important in Vanuatu. Every turn you clear an action space of all your discs on it. If you had more discs than anyone else or break a tie by being higher in turn order, you can take the action. If not, those discs did less than nothing for you. A disc you can’t use is like throwing a dart into your own eye: Do it enough and you’re not going to be winning the game.

Spreading your discs thin can get you more actions, but only if your actions are sufficiently self-contained: Perhaps you are parked in a spot where you have access to one of your huts, to goods for sale, to fish, to treasure—you’re golden. But if you need to move to get to where you’ll be performing your other actions, things get as uncomfortably tight as an empty wallet in a pair of hot pants. If you’re low on the turn-order totem pole, you can kiss your chances of effective accomplishment goodbye. Loading up your discs on the bonus action space may be your highest priority: becoming start player next turn.

Unless you are on the other side of the board, and unless you want a character someone already has. The start player will ditch his character (each character buffs a different standard action) to claim a new one next turn, and so will each other player. If that means a particular currently held character will (in your estimation) trickle down the line to you, then you might want to stay in last place. If you’ve set up camp on the other side of an island and are doing your own thing, you might not care at all: You’ll get your actions in due time, and you’ll get more actions than anyone else will.

Because juxtaposition in Vanuatu bleeds off actions. People who are adjacent to other people choose fewer actions and pump them up more. Who takes what action when matters, especially if it’s building a hut of your own color—the quintessential act in Vanuatu. A hut of your own color lets you sell fish [i]and[/i] sell to tourists, and that’s a lot in this game. But if someone tries to move in to join in the fishing boom or the hut rush, then even more actions bleed off as people jostle for position. It happens if someone even appears to be. Taking your whole turn in Vanuatu bears a good resemblance to trying to assassinate someone in the middle of Mardi Gras using a poisoned needle.

Play in Vanuatu is all about the spatial aspect. There are right places to be, and because there are, there are right times to be. Fishing by itself is like holding a scavenger hunt in a hurricane; carrying tourists around the islands more so. But the storm is an outworking of the players’ actions, and if you can find a path through those then you have a path through the storm to create VP-laden locations (the start player discovers additional islands in locations of his choice) and exploit them. From beginning to end a game of Vanuatu is a highly ritualized form of combat: You can win by being quick or you can win by being early or you can win by being just exactly late enough. But you can’t win by not watching where you are standing.[color=#ffffff]a9Z4MnAx[/color]

This is a really nasty one, perhaps too nasty. There are only a few actions available,and who gets to do which action is determined by an area-control mechanism. This is clever and interesting, but it also means there's a good chance you may not be able to do anything on your turn.  There's also an Age of Steam-esque role selection, which is well conceived, and again, interesting. There's a lot of neat stuff going on here, but ultimately, I think the game is just a little too mean for me. (1 play)

RATING: 8
With elegant rules, tough decisions, really confrontational gameplay, great production values, and even a tropical theme, this game is hitting all my buttons. 

There are a lot of euros in which interesting decisions spring from the fact that you would like to do more than you can, but usually this limit is imposed directly by the game (e.g., you can do only two actions on your turn). In Vanuatu, the limit comes from player interaction. You can almost certainly do one action successfully. You can probably do two. Three? Now you’re getting greedy. And yet you want to get ahead . . .

Would really like to try it without the role cards. 

Unfortunately, my wife and I didn't care for the 2-player variant. 

Rating lowered from 9 to 8 after 5 plays. I think I would prefer a few house rules to deal with some slightly rough edges to the game, at least with inexperienced players: lose the "must do the action if you can" rule, remove the restriction preacher's no-other-majority restriction, and let people sail "through" islands. All those would make the game slightly more forgiving, but it would still be plenty nasty. Also maybe play one fewer round; I find it so odd that the last two tiles have no islands on them.

Well I was REALLY looking forward to this one for quite some time, and got let down pretty hard. From what I knew it was a strategic game with some potential evil, cunning and/or dirty play, but it was not too overboard. Then I played...

First off, I played with 5 and REALLY did not want to, but alas did anyway, likely a bad choice right there (read more chaos)(note was also a little tired so didn't help either). 2nd, sure there is some strategic play here, but does it matter? HAH! Everyone seemed to get boned somewhere, so in one sense the dirt was spread around for sure, but OTOH where is the control? (also, it seemed MUCH more tactical to me, since things were ever shifting like random action resolution, etc...) You really need to sit and try to calculate what everyone else is doing, to try and determine the order of actions, but yet even if you do, things can very well pan out differently. 

More negatives include:  Turn order seemed WAY too important, and yet you could still get screwed! Role selection choices were often poor, potential pissing wars (usually like this but not here), often forced to take an action where you are already winning, too long.  

I liked it initially ("liked") but the longer I played the more I wished I wasn't, my rating gives it some benefit of the doubt that 3 or 4 might be better, with 5 this is a 5 at best for me. This game really rubbed me the wrong way, and maybe just doesn't suit me to be honest. As is often the case, Morgan D sums up my heartfelt feelings here nicely: 

[q]Decent Euro showing off its French roots. Lots of interaction. If you like games where you need to overly plan out a dry luckless system and then throw it into the chaos mixer to see if your plans worked out, then this might be for you.[/q]

14Jan12 A five player game with 4 noobies. Totally different experience.  

This is a very good game, and maybe more. Playing by all the rules certainly helps, but the game is just so great generating much angst and complaint, though at oneself for being stupid more than against other players who were blocking you.

However, all my criticisms about icons etc as valid for me as they were in the first game. How they got past the design stage is a mystery to me.

Maybe we original purchasers will be offered (at nominal cost) upgrades to new, improved hex tiles?

*********************************************************

20 December. Oops - we played without a a crucial rule - 
if you are the start player (or person closest to start player when he's not present) on a tied majority then you have that majority! 

That would have had a major impact on our game, so I will happily re-play the game but with all the rules!

Sorry everyone - my copy has now gone (for the time being?) from the for sale list.

*********************************************************

I so wanted to like this game - my only Essen 2011 purchase.

But it is virtually no fun to play although we enjoyed reading the rules and the art work is engaging.

Some minor gripes:

1.The icons on the sea tiles (the numbers on the fish and treasure chests are far too small and would be better if there were the number of icons instead (e.g. three fish instead of on with a hard to read 3 in it)

2. The cubes, a nice size, are too big for the spaces on the island tiles and worse still for the demand (ship) cards.

3. The character cards that relate to the actions could be better match icon wise.

4. The icons on the action squares are too small and soon covered by the player markers.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (November 2012)

This is an evil EVIL game :devil:. It is also a great game, perhaps the best (or one of the best) worker placement game I have played. You can argue that the game is not really a worker placement (It is a bidding game according to its BGG page) game and you would (could) be right, however, to me, it feels like a worker placement game with 5 workers that can be used to do up to 9 different actions. The planning and the action phases are the core of the game and they are really marvelous (The evilness comes from this part). To use an action you need to have the majority of workers in the action itself, otherwise you cannot execute the action. This majority control of an action offers a lot of hard options and meaningful decisions ripe with player interactions and repercussions that you need to really analyze with care. Going first gives you the advantage of breaking ties, but going last gives you a better control over the actions. Due to all this, the game has a small margin for errors so the game is medium heavy in my book. Not for newbies but I love it. 

There is also role selection a la Carson City, each round you will have a role with special rules. However this game is much more better than Carson City.

The rules are easy to grasp, but the game is very deep and involved. The theme is a letdown for me (I have zero interest on it), but as the mechanics are brilliant it doesn´t bother me as much and it is even a good fit with the mechanics. The art is very nice as well, judging from the art alone you could think the game is easy and nice but it is not, you will have plenty of chances to mess with the other player’s plans :D. The game components are ok, although it is very nice the way Vanuatu manages the game money without having extra bits. Kudos for that! 

The time play can be a tad long, furthermore if in your game group there are a lot of gamers who analyze a lot. I have played with 5 players and the gameplay was excellent, but the play time was around the 3 hour mark, but I still think 5 players is the way to go with Vanuatu.

I believe this will go higher in my personal ratings, for now it is a 7.5.

I will bring the game with me to my gaming sessions in the foreseeable future so I hope to play it again really soon.

After more than 10 plays, Vanuatu continues to be a great game for me. Some friends feel the stalls are a must if you want to win. So, in a way, you have only one path to victory. I disagree with that affirmation, but the stalls are indeed very important. 

I tried to get the expansion for the game but it is next to impossible to get, I managed to get the rules so perhaps I can try it that way.

Vanuatu is a great game, I won’t get rid of it ever but you do need a special kind of player to enjoy this game fully. Some friends didn’t like the depth of the game; others didn’t like the meanness of the game. I love it.

RATING: 7
My initial play was with 3 players and I suspect the game loses a lot of tension at that number. It didn't feel quite as brutal as many of my geekbuddies describe it. However, I could see this being extremely brutal with 4 and especially 5 players. I'd also like to try it without the role cards. The most common response to the card throughout our game was "these suck" anyway. Could bump this up a notch with more players. We'll see.

Feels like a streamlined if not a bit lighter take on Kaivai. The fight over actions, majorities, and turn-order is the heart of the game. For those who care, the art is quite lovely and the theme is mostly pasted but pretty standard for a euro.

We do not play with the role cards.

Cute theme and components but this is arch-euro.  Totally tactical.  Very little strategy.  Primary game mechanic (placing your wooden action bits) has no relationship to the theme at all.  If you like Dominant Species then you will probably like this.  I don't much like either.

This game makes me feel the hot tropical sun, the cool depths of the ocean as I dive for treasure, the cozy shade under a tree to take a nap...

Interesting and different action selection method and a pleasing array of strategic options to score points. It makes me think and ponder and agonize over decisions, which I like. Definitely a "gamer's game".

I really dig the visual presentation too, kind of a graphic novel type approach. I also like that I got to learn about a culture I'm not familiar with: you can draw turtles in the sand (a historically ancient island communication method apparently), export high quality beef (from an island! really!), even go take a rest in the shade. Which other game lets you take a nap?  This is Island Life: The Boardgame.

Read the rules and am very impressed! This has a very novel action-selection/majority/worker-placement mechanic that is just too clever too be real.

Players have 5 action discs each. In turn order they are placed onto 9 available actions. Then resolution begins in turn order. The current player must select an action on which they have a majority of discs (more than any other player) and perform that action, removing the discs. Ties are won by the highest in turn order. If the player has no majority then they choose an action to remove their discs from without performing the action.

This is simply brutal and delicious I want to see it in action.

Downgraded to 6/10 after another game with a single player basically deciding the game in favour of the player directly after him by always taking the starting player every round. Good in the right circumstances, negative fun otherwise.
---
Vanuatu's unique twist is the introduction of majority activation into worker placement. The result is a lot of potential to screw other players' plans. Players have to make the tradeoff between high yield action chains and low risk placements with lower payout. Unluckily, unexperienced or irrational players can screw you out even from these low risk placements effectively taking you out of the game which marred my first play. With more experience it should be possible to strategically plan ahead at least one round to find less contested fields of action more often. One of the best titles of the Essen 2011 lot. I give it an 8/10 assuming that it is played with the right group of experienced players. Compared with other big Euros from this crop like Trajan, Ora et Labora or MIL(1049) it feels streamlined and focussed. 
There's one rule that bugs me which is the odd determination of placing the new tiles. At first, the placement rules can be so strict that there's no choice where to place them, while suddenly they are all invalid leaving it totally free where to place the tiles.
Oh, and I like the art. Noticeably French style without getting too cartoony which is a nice diversion from the functional German design and the often baroque American style.

The bidding system/action system in this game is very clever and gives a lot of opportunities for screwing over other players, or getting screwed.  The competition for resources can be fierce.  I thought this was a good, not great game.  I'd definitely try it again, its probably never going to be a hot game for me.

Vanuatu has a somewhat convincing theme, much better than, say, Hawaii. But there's something about the game that I find bothersome. The idea of the blocking that occurs is fun, but in practice it is a bit annoying. This is most likely because the amount of decisions to be made feels thin compared to the amount of time the game takes to play. This would be a lot better as a 45 minute game, but as a 90 minute game it misses the mark.

RATING: 7
One of the best games of 2011. The game looks really good and every single little mechanism fits in and doesn't feel out of place. Action choosing mechanism is really cool and original, but could create some AP at times. The other really pleasant thing is the money / vp management system. Your needs and tactical opportunities are changing rapidly and there's some tension all the time, but it doesn't go over, although the game can be very mean. The story arch is similar in each game played due to the low variety in archipelago tiles which also makes it very important to be the first player in the right time. It is a tad too long and repetitive towards the end. I feel the game would have benefited from having one or two rounds less. From the rules technical point of view it feels like it would have made sense to set things happening at the beginning of a round to instead take place at the end of previous round. It's majorly disappointing that the original and exciting art of the first edition was ditched for the second edition.

RATING: 5
The action selection mechanism is interesting, and so are the character cards. They make for a different game than the usual worker placement. That being said, the actions they allow you to do are BORING. Get a bit of money, go somewhere to get some money. There are multiple ways to get points thematically, but mechanically, it's just "oh, you did that, well here are 3 points". The huts are not that interesting, nor is the growing archipelago.

Could have been great.

The sign of a great game: you find yourself strained to do things, yet you are so eager to do everything you can and remain optimistic that you can get ahead. I bought this as a gift for two friends and played with them twice, with all of us being new to the game. Typical for a Euro, it wasn't clear who won until the end and we were all fairly close to each other. You always felt like you had a chance and surprisingly, I often found myself enjoying taking the last play on a turn, rather than the first. The betting aspect is great -- you have to judge other players' plans well and make sure you allocate appropriately to achieve all that you need. And it's so much fun to cause pain with an bet that disrupts an opponent's plans or an order of play that delays an action. Not for the thin-skinned, but for everyone else, a lot of good-natured, mean fun.

Vanuatu has an excellent, and cruel with more players, worker placement majority system where ties are broken by turn order.

In your turn you have to take your majority (of your choice) . If you don't have a majority you take one of your minorities of the board (all discs) and don't perform an action.
the turnorder is very important as a tiebreaker but how the roles selection works is also pretty unique. I think there are 12 roles to choose from and people hold on to their roles until they get to pick another one. So it's possible that some roles never get to you because of turnorder tricks. 

verdict:
Vanuatu is an enjoyable game that is about blocking, turn order and majorities. It's not a friendly game. You will screw someone over. (I wouldn't call it kingmaking though.)It's AP prone and the real problem 
with vanuatu is who is its public.
My guess is a player that wants to try anything at least once. It's not a gateway or a family game. Nor is it a real gamers game for me because performing the action takes too much time for me. (that happens when you play on the ipad) That's the downside to the selection system. I'm still not sure if I should get it.

Gorgeous production as well.

A very nice AP brain-burner. Plays quick for quite heavy action selection game (we did 4p. in ~2h). The role cards are maybe a bit thin, and some are really, REALLY bad, but usually you can avoid the worst ones. Action selection mechanic is well done, even though it offers lots of screwing opportunities. There are at least two ways to counter this screwage (+ the preacher(?) role), one is to fight back, and the second is choosing lots of "filler" actions which you can perform while waiting for the blocking person to be forced to take the action which is blocking you. I usually dislike heavy games with heavy screwage options, but here the role selection directly signals which actions you are "reserving" to yourself, and probably will fight for if need be. Others quickly lost interest in those actions in fear of losing much of their actions if they have to fight for them.

Theme is maybe a bit light, but components are nice and game is visually pleasant. Definitely looking for more plays.

Not the best with 5 -> too long. What did a liked here was the mechanic how you choose the things what you want to do AND especially the way WHEN you can do those things. That was unique and interensting and offers plenty of nasty moves. But otherwise the game tends to be too calculable (what to do, how to do it etc) and this makes the overall feeling quite boring. Some hidden cards and goals would make the game more interesting and some surprises are always welcome.

RATING: 4
Like all worker placement games, it scales badly with different amount of players. I played at 4 and I hardly see how this game could be playable at 5.

At the start, the choices seems overwhelming because there are tons of characters and actions you could chose. As the game progress, you get used to it' and it's a bit less a burden.

There is a few things that seems unbalanced, like the tokens for resting are really out of balance. Mostly, the first player is worth 10 times more than all other. They should have given bigger value on those tokens. At least 3 money or VP and 2vp-2$ for the token giving both. Especially because I lacked of cash all the game and it's hard to get cash, if those tokens would have given more, it would have been an alternative options.

Else, there are not really obvious flaws I can see, it's just did not hooked me up and looked pretty boring to me. This is why it has a low rating.

It's the kind of game where what ever you do, you'll get vp for it and all players ends up with very similar score without ever knowing why a certain player won.

RATING: 7
This is one nasty, vicious, cut-throat game with the action markers where you can cut people out of actions, particularly if they try to do too much!  I realize the potential value of being the start player and winning ties for majorities, but I almost preferred being lower in turn order and being able to play strategies that required less risk.  Going first almost requires you to focus on one or two actions...going later in turn order may give you the freedom to take more actions that may be of lesser value.  Money is tight in this game, and this game has a nasty addition that if you have $10 on hand, you trade all your money in for 5 points.  BTW, that 2 to 1 ratio is not necessarily that great and severely limits your future actions!  Enjoy the simple art in this game as well.  The fish and treasure are definitely fiddly and can be easily lost (round disks the size of Puerto Rico workers).

Interesting worker placement game.  Resources are very tight. Also, competing for those resources and particular actions is very cutthroat.  This is not a "nice" game.

Le Havre is a much better sandbox game to try out strategies.  This game was fun though!

RATING: 7
Put it simple, Vanuatu is a good game with 2 major flaws to prevent it from entering the hall of fame.
First, the game has an unexpected high level of screw factor despite the euro ruleset. It comes from 1 minor rule: you need to remove an entire stack of action tokens if you don't have any majority. And after that, it's still possible you don't have majority and has to remove another stack. In our game, I've witnessed few occurrences of such situation. Part of this could be due to our inexperience, but this also occurs in later turns in which all of us get the system quite well.
Second, the game is very AP prone. Part is due to the above point, but as the situation changed almost every single turn and the possibilities are too much, the AP players would make this game way way longer than expected.
I played with a group of 4 other rather AP players and we finished the game in slight more than 3 hours as our first play.

Excellent game, without an ounce of fat or unnecessary trimmings.  All parts are connected, most actions have weight, consequences, and matter.  There is real excitement and tension while playing the game.  There are many paths to victory and strategy matters.  You feel like you are playing the game rather than being played by the game or subject to the whims of luck.  Truly original mechanics that work perfectly well, like a well tested, well oiled machine.  Depth of play and strategy that rewards more plays.  Technically, the game is close to a 10.  The reason I rate it lower is due to three facts:  1) length -- with three players it can take up to three hours, though it feels much shorter since it's so engaging; 2) AP -- given the weight and importance of every decision it can lead to some AP or downtime (not unlike strategic games like chess); 3) Finding the right crowd -- given the weight of the game and the blocking mechanism you want to be playing it with other friends and gamers that will all appreciate the game for what it is.  One more positive thing -- great theme and graphics.  The graphics are pastel and soothing, which is great for a game that is so cutthroat and competitive, nice to look at the board and bits.  The icons are very clear.  The theme is perfect -- paradise and scarcity of resources in paradise, it just all fits together.  A masterpiece of its kind.

If you are ok with being forced to play (if you want to be competitive) as a complete dick then this is the game for you. I get that that is the way the game is designed. But, like the people who say they don't like to play games that force them to lie, I do not like games that force me to be an ass. 

I also ABSOLUTELY HATE that almost every round, if not every round is based on getting that 1st player status. Every other decision seems to be completely secondary to that. Otherwise you could have a completely useless round the turn after, and not get to do anything you want to do. That feeling of necessity in getting that one thing (1st player) seems too funneled and completely broken to me. 

The game is much too long in my opinion for a take-that game. After one round of, wow that was "fun" I just got completely screwed over, I have a hard time looking forward to future rounds that promise similar results. That is of course unless you (as mentioned above) focus on getting the 1st player marker for the next round, and very likely trashing your current round in the process (ie often spending 3+ actions) to reach for that goal.

Also during the game I played, there were multiple rounds where options were not even available. By that I mean: oh I could take the build action, but wait there are absolutely no places to build. Not because I'm not in the right spot and need to move. There are simply no spots available anywhere. I could take the fish action, but wait there are no fish at all etc etc. This was definitely the case with even the little special power tiles that you select at the beginning of each round also. It seemed like there were a couple of obvious choices. Then there were a handful that were just not useful (because of board limitations etc), as just mentioned. I did like, however, that you had to recycle those powers each turn and likely a power or 2 would be unused for at least one turn. 

So in summary, if you have someone you don't like, introduce them to this game. You can almost bank on really pissing them off, and will likely never see them again. Just rename the game "Wanna be a Dick?" and the game is now complete. Maybe that is what Vanuatu really means?? Also if you like games that look nice and have stuff that seems interesting to do, but really everyone's sole focus is on 1 spot on the board and winning that, everything else is just a distraction. Awesome, this is your game! If you also like games where half of the options you are allowed/want to do might not even be on the board, so now you have even less options... Well then do I have a game for you .... look no further... Welcome to Vanuatu! Enjoy!

RATING: 5
Played twice, once with 5 and once with 4. Only moderately interesting. 
The interaction on the action spaces (the best bit of design in this game IMO) is very complex which leads to a very slow game. The interlocking mechanisms are nice at first, but I found them frustratingly narrow in my second game. There is not much development, turns are more or less the same throughout the game, and every action is just a little step towards a small sub-goal.
Not bad, but too slow and plodding to make me want to play again.

RATING: 7
Very original bidding mechanism with which you can influence your own actions, and the order in which you can execute them, but also the order in which the other players will be able to execute their actions. 
So this means you easily destroy your opponents plans.

Game just takes a bit too long with 4 (and 5) players, since you need to do a lot of thinking about making sure you can do the actions you selected in the right order. Nevertheless, the game is not to complicated, and after the bidding round, it's just executing what you have selected, which goes pretty fast.

Thematically this game makes a lot of sense. 

Played a very bad first game, and my second (1,5 year later) was at least just as bad. But still I love this game.

For me the game enjoyment depends highly on the group. It's a kind of worker-placement-auction game, with a nicely implemented auction mechanic, but it can get cut-throath and AP prone. Luckly to me, the group with whom I played was a nice one for the game and I think everybody enjoy the game.

I would play it again if suggested, but It didn't make an special strong impression on me. Besides that I don't think the game is a good choice to play in family, so as a family gamer, is not in my buying list. But overall I would recommend to try this game... as long you are not playing with sore losers, AP prone gamers or players that loose interest quickly.

I didn´t mind the action selection too much, perhaps because I only had one of my  actions gone completely wasted in our game. I can see why it annoys people if your whole turn is wasted. What I found more disturbing was the lack of interesting choices in several of the eight turns. The islands filled up and the ocean was emptied, and we were left with one or zero interesting characters to pick and almost no meaningful actions. There was just no development in the game. With so many good titles out there, we won´t be playing this again.

This game brought some familiar mechanisms together in a way that felt fresh and unique.  It's a mix of worker placement, role selection, resource management, area control, all wrapped around a pretty fascinating action selection track.  The bit about only taking actions where you have the majority is what makes this game stand out, for better or worse.  I love the interaction this adds and even the uncertainty of trying to predict what opponents will do.  This game can allow for blocking and can make some rounds feel much less productive than desired, but some gamers enjoy this.  Overall I enjoyed the unique feel of this game although I'm not sure it will see repeated plays and feelings were mixed among other players.

A tough game that can sure be frustrating when you don't get your actions.  That being said I really love the prime game mechanic: after actions are chosen blindly, players take turn choosing actions but you can only play an action if you have the majority in that action.  If on your turn you don't have the majority anywhere you must pick up one of your bids.

"In a larger multiplayer game, this can be absolutely brutal, rendering players' turns to ineffective rounds by blocking any lynchpin actions.

The mechanic is a very interesting take, and it does remind me a bit of The Speicherstadt. Unfortunately, Vanuatu plays over 8 rounds, and that's twice as long as it needs to be.

The game is worth trying for a few rounds, but is not my type of game. It may work for some people, but too mean and too slow for me."

I hope after I get a better handle on the prediction and strategy I won't feel so hobbled (or accidentally mean) but it will take more than my single play to know. I'd aim for 3p on the next play.

One must be prepared for the screwage. That is, expect to be screwed, prepare to screw, and plan your moves very carefully. You can't afford to miss the critical action that the rest depend on, or you lose it all. If you go in with all that in mind, and all players are on the same page, it's actually quite interesting.

Interesting game, but the cut-throat variant without the cards has too many options to make mistakes and blow yourself completely out of the water and NEVER come back into it. End of game when the game lasts another 2 hours!

Update: game four with some hazy rules proved it's a cruel, cut throat game even with the cards. You're playing against the game as much as the players.

Mean as shit, stabby little euro. Looks pleasant but it's not. It's MEAN. You can deny people actions, make them waste turns. It's got a little bit of brain burn to it as well, mostly in the form of trying to decide what other players are after and how figuring out how to deny them and/or protect your own interests.

Vanuatu is just amazing - always presenting players with tough choices and surprises!  This gives me the experience I had wanted (but didn't get) from Libertalia or Nothing Personal. Vanuatu has the meanest, most cutthroat action selection mechanism I've encountered!  The cruelty of the mechanisms is off the charts! At the same time, the relaxing theme of the game stands in sharp contrast to the mechanisms: you spend your days in this beautiful Pacific island fishing, diving, resting, drawing in the sand, and island hopping with tourists!  It sounds so nice, it looks so gorgeous, but it plays like a knife fight in a phone booth!  You had better program your actions properly or you will get shanked!

Great and innovative mechanic in a refreshing theme, but...

The game demands decisions before you understand what you're doing... and that decisions can just screw the entire game experience.
Played it with five and thought it just did not work.
To long (over 3 hours), random chaos with little or no control... very frustrating that after one round i was out of the game and the winner was found.

Will give it another chance with fewer players just for the sake of the mechanic...

EDIT: With 3 players the games works so much better...
Still to long and to nasty...

An interesting worker placement game which develops as the game progresses and in so doing maintains interest.
Money is exceptionally tight and especially so at the start of the game when if you spend all your money and have no way of easily generating more (no hit to sell fish, no treasure, not in a position to transport tourists), then you will take a few game rounds to recover and the game will be over for you.
Looking forward to my second game.

RATING: 7
In each round, you have five tokens to play onto eight action spaces. If you have a majority on an action space (ties broken by the start player token), then you may use the action. When it is your turn, if you do not have a majority, then you must remove one of your tokens. The theme of the game is Vanuatu, so one is navigating a boat, collecting treasures, fishing, selling fish, transporting tourists, building huts, buying gems or resting. At the start of each round, you choose a special character card which may enhance the bonus of one of those action spaces. Play over 8 rounds, where new tiles consisting of islands/treasures/fish show up, and the resources are scarce.

This is a very tense game. Games are different depending if treasure show up late or early, and same with islands. You have to adapt to the flow of the game, the changing player order, and interference from your opponents. I'm wondering why this game didn't get printed by a "big" publisher. On the other hand, it is potentially easy to be screwed if you are not careful, especially if people don't know exactly what they are doing. I'm a bit on the fence on this one, since it does tend to clock in over 2 1/2 hrs.

I played this at boiteajeux. The game has a very good mechanism of action auctions but I got bored quickly with just a couple of games which all felt basically the same. This is strange, since all my games were played with different players and the number of players varied between 3 and 5. Five is best in my opinion, but anyway this game has too little to offer to me. I'll pass.

Wow!  Such an uncommon and unforgiving action selection mechanism - but it makes sense, and makes this game awesome.  Plenty of options, and while there are several paths to victory, building huts is the main VP engine.  Fun?  Uhh, sure.  More than a little cutthroat too, and nicely thinky!

A game with a lot of decision-making, seemingly difficult because of the length of the rules, then seemingly simple because the rules, while long, aren't hard, then actually difficult because it's a gamer's game that's heavy on indirect combat (think Luna or Container). This is a subgenre I'm particularly bad at (second to direct combat), so I find it equal parts fascinating and frustrating -- the jockeying for position, indirect attacks and implied countermeasures.

The most interesting part about this worker-placement game is the novel majority system. It rewards careful planning and allows for plenty of blocking and sly moves.

However, it's hard to shake the feeling that this is a bog-standard euro otherwise, albeit a good one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Very special worker placement game where your wokers will dictate the actions you will do, and the order of these actions compared to the other players. You can focus on a couple of important actions and almost make sure you will get to do them in time, or you can spread thin in multiple actions and trying to do all of them, but risking doing nothing all (or very few of them).

The game is very nasty, because you can deny actions to other players. Most of the times, you will annoy them and they will annoy you not on purpose (or maybe they will do it on purpose). This is the core element of the game, quite original, and it works very nice (once you start to do it, it's not as nasty as it might seem). But the game has more things, it's not a light game, but a medium euro.

I would say that the game works very well. You need some serious planning and the decisions are plenty and very meaninful. That is also the cause of its main problem: even if turns should be quite fast (you know what are the main actions and you should try to make sure you'll do them, and then spend the rest of your workers with accesory actions), sometimes the other players will put you in a tight spot and you'll have to reasess your situation... And AP prone player should definitly stay away from this game :P

Reeeeeeeally long with five players. I am also a bit wary about the fact that the contents of all tile stacks are exactly the same in every game.

Rating will rise if the game runs more swiftly with four players. Since the emphasis is on screwage here, three players might not be the sweet spot either.

Uno dei migliori giochi del 2011. In 5 giocatori è oltremisura caotico e affollato, sembra ingiocabile, ma al tempo stesso offre un'interazione incredibile che litiga con la necessità di programmare ogni azione. In 3 diventa al contrario noioso e poco avvincente; forse in 4 giocatori si trova il giusto compromesso. I benefici di alcuni personaggi e quello di alcune azioni si comprendono solo dopo qualche partita. Alcuni turni potrebbero risultare frustranti se non si riescono a campiere le azioni programmate (spesso), ma questo rende il gioco bellissimo! Gioco indipendente dalla lingua; scaricabile il regolamento ufficiale per due giocatori in italiano su BGG.

RATING: 9
Together, we got in our first five-player game of Vanuatu, and it was a blast! Even the kids were able to pick it up rather easily, although Jason (aged 8) was a little too concerned about getting to do what he really wanted so he usually piled too many guys on a single action, reducing the tension we might have felt from a full 5-player game. 

Despite some others' comments, I don't consider this game particularly "nasty." Yea, you might lose an action here or there because you misplayed, but that can be managed by putting yourself in positions to take advantage of actions that other players don't want or can't take, allowing you to get away with placing only 1 token on some potentially highly contested actions. It's not nasty in the sense that players are actively out to get you. They aren't; they are just taking advantage of your mistakes.

Because of the theme and the action selection mechanism, I've heard comparisons to Kaivai, which we coincidentally played the next day, and Vanuatu is better, IMO. Kaivai is simpler, dryer, and slightly nastier, with nearly zero randomness, but the decisions seemed overall easier, whereas Vanuatu had many agonizing moments during both the action planning and the action resolution phases.

The game is much better with 4 or 5 than with 3. Because the action selection track has a fixed size, the tension ratchets up dramatically as you add each additional player. With only three, you can essentially lay down 1 worker on each space and still take all of your actions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Rating very likely to change with more play.

Vanuatu [i]could[/i] be a stabby game where the players constantly prevent each other from making progress, and the leader is doomed to miss almost every action they try. Our game wasn't like that - somehow I was the only bastard at the table. It didn't work.

There were a couple of other factors: we all got confused by the French cards and selected the wrong action at least once per player. And while the rules are OK, they could be better organised.

On the other hand: the turn order mechanism creates interesting decisions, and I liked the "action choosing" too.

Edit: I still need to play this more frequently; it gets better each time.

Another edit: A great game when everyone understands the importance of spoiling the other players turns. Not a game for folks who insist on "nice" play. Find a group of bastards and play this!

Wonderful. Screwage - a lot of it self-imposed - make this an excellent game.

Not nearly as mean-spirited as its preceding reputation had it, it has a neat race component to the worker placement section. You place more meeples on an action, you get to do it first. You place less, you'll have to wait until those ahead of you do their thing first. Actions are standard ... move, get resources, convert resources into money or VPs, manipulate turn order, etc. The game is unfortunately round-based, which allows the map to gradually fill in, but which gives it all a non-organic feel. The mini-races for the actions do provide some decent thought re who's going to be going for what, what will I need to fight for, and is it worth it, or do I go for other actions which will be less contested. In essence that's the game ... to get the maximum number of actions that can be used effectively, hoping you don't get sucked into bidding wars. It was well worth exploring as a result.

Beware unsuspecting gamers!  While this game may seem like a pleasant game about fishing, ferrying tourists around, and drawing turtles in the sand, it really has more of the "knife fight in a phone booth" vibe to it.  Players are competing for very limited actions, screwing over other players left and right as they go.  The real problem is that there just isn't enough to do; in any given turn, 5 of the 10 available actions may be completely useless.  This isn't incidental; the game encourages this by making building/drawing spots very limited (new areas are typically filled up on the turn they're made available), fish and treasure are quickly depleted (ditto), and there's even a zero tourists tile!  I'd be the first to admit that the action selection system is clever, but I really didn't enjoy the way the game taunts you with all the things you can't do, combined with the screwage factor.

[floatleft][ImageID=1186623][/floatleft]When I first played Vanuatu I absolutely loved it. The game totally jived for me and I felt completely at home playing it because Vanuatu is an evil game and I love evil games. When I finally stepped away and had some time to process the game, I still loved Vanuatu but I felt that the game was disjointed. The scoring mechanisms felt compartmentalized and disconnected from one another. On top of that, the last turn is a total failure in game design and it should have been stricken from the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fascinating worker placement and role selection game. The big design standout here is that you can be locked out of taking some of your action assignments if you aren't careful about placement. In general I'm not a huge fan of games that have action denial as a mechanic, but here it's almost something that you do to yourself by not paying proper attention than it is something one of your opponents can inflict on you. The essence is you have a few worker tokens you get to place. When you resolve your actions, you can only resolve an action where you have a majority of tokens, so you might need to plan and react if an opponent goes for the same action as you during the placement phase.

The map is large for the amount of movement points your boats realistically get. Sometimes your boat can get stuck on the wrong end of the map because you don't have enough move actions left in the game for it to be relevant.

RATING: 7
The frequent use of the word 'brutal' in the Essen buzz about Vanuatu had me interested and it didn't disappoint. The game revives the tired worker placement genre with a quite brilliant mechanic. Players take turns to place workers on action spaces, 2 then 2 then 1. So far, so samey. But in the resolution phase, when it comes to your turn you can only take an action on a space where you have the majority of workers, and then you remove them. If you don't have a majority at all, you still have to remove a set of workers! Because you often need to take actions in a specific order, the placement phase turns into a brain-melting ordeal of the best kind.

Another great design decision is not to build too much complexity into the actions themselves, so the selection mechanic stays front and centre. This part of the game is somewhat reminiscent of Tikal, with the same gradually-revealed hex board and desire to place profitable opportunities where only you can exploit them quickly. I also like that there are multiple point-scoring paths, but no engine-building or non-linear rewards to force you to stick to one of them. So, like Navegador, it's good to do what others aren't, but unlike Navegador, you can easily change what you're doing on a turn to turn, opportunistic basis.

Definitely gets better the more you play it. It can seem very accidently cutthroat at first, with players bumping eachother off of action spaces and snatching points out from one another, but once you get used to the bidding system and the role cards you'll find Vanuatu levels out into a pretty tight euro. It incorporates a lot of my favorite mechanics and feels unique enough to keep me coming back. Vanuatu is an easy game to recommend.

Update: Vanuatu is pure cutthroat chaos at the max player count. Will not play that way any more.

Game felt perhaps a turn or two too long as we were running out of options at the end of the game, but perhaps this was due to a very asymmetric distribution of tourists which had them all arrive early rendering many of the actions moot in the last few turns.  Takes a while to get around the action/tempo interaction (aka [i]programmation[/i] in the description).  Games does rely on cooperative screwage as a result where all the players need to work against the (perceived) leader.  A rather simple engine to build and despite the choices, easy to teach and launch into.

It's another multi-method points pickup game. In this case turn order and worker placement greediness will determine your fate. Players are not necessarily locked out of an action choice by occupying it later, but a simple majority with a turn order tie breaker will determine whether a player is eligible to take the action or not. The quirk here is that as an action is taken the player removes their workers and this will free up the action space for other players to use it. So timing is everything. Mess up and you'll find that either you miss out on an action entirely, or you don't get to take the action when you need to. It'll happen. It's bound to. The trick is not to let it spoil your day. There's plenty of other fish in the sea, or turtles to draw in the sand, or tourists to tout your wares to.

Building huts on the islands seems to be key. There's a lot of tourist points in them there huts. Maybe too many because it seems to kill off any alternate routes to victory and makes the game too scripted for my taste for repeated play.

It's an interesting mechanic, but also not really a very enjoyable one. The game is nowhere near as mean as I was led to believe it could be. (Maybe I have a different definition of mean than most.) Sure, sometimes, (when you're in the middle order especially), you can miss an action or two, but it's quite manageable and usually a result of greed coming back to bite you in the butt. There's no lucky dice rolls here messing with your head. It's all down to player interaction. That's a good thing.

With the character selection at the beginning of each round it feels like I'm playing a Martin Wallace's Automobile version of a Stefan Feld Ystari points salad game. Trajan was a better version of multi-method points pickup from the same year, but this has nice art and a nice theme, so I don't mind playing it at all.

Vanuatu is an example of a packaging well done. The game is both beautiful and functional, a combo I'd like to see more often.

Unfortunately, I don't care much for this kind of games with high interaction and the possibility to completely screw another player for one turn (or more).

For people who like that, however, this is a most solid choice. Even me, I can see myself play it sometimes (rather not with 5 players though).

RATING: 8
Just 8 turns - done in under two hours with rules explanation, played with the full 5 players.  It looked at one point as if we had a runaway winner, but the person in last place managed to zoom up in points and ended up winning the game over the last turn and final scoring.  

You don't bid for actions in the traditional sense.  You do place your action markers two, two and one - so three times around to bid.  And you can divide them up - or concentrate them - however you want.  Five players gives you some real competition and makes things nice and tight.  You have to be aware not only of who is bidding on what, but also what order you might be able to take the chosen actions.  Will the person ahead of you in turn order take this action or another?  There's always the possibility of some 'screw you' in choosing the order in which you take your actions, if you have the possibility of more than one when it is your turn around.  One action per player, repeated until all are taken - or missed out on because you don't have the majority.

The only game I tried was with 5P and lasted close to 3 hours, which felt too long. Of course, 4 of us were new to the game, but still, the action selection mechanism presents the potential for a lot of AP. Vanuatu isn't your typical 'multi-player solitaire' Euro as there is a lot of interaction when players compete to gain a majority in actions they want to take. The risk of getting locked out of any useful actions is very real, making the game more brutal than the sunny artwork would let on. 

I prefer games with resource-generating engines and it is rather annoying that money can't be hoarded in Vanuatu - players have to start earning money from scratch once it has been spent, and money is [i]very[/i] crucial. Overall, Vanuatu is a fresh spin on the usual 'multiple paths to victory' Euro, although it is just too long and heavy for my tastes.

Classical Euro where you're picking a bonus-supplying role and then bidding for actions to undertake in order to score VPs by setting up your own piece of paradise on Vanuatu. Keep the tourists happy, make sure you trade fish for cash, or dive for buried treasure etc.

The fun starts in the bidding where too many people vying for the same thing can hose an upstream player who runs out of actions to take and can't take it because actions are undertaken in turns from top bidders and then in event of a tie, turn order. 

Colourful graphics but typical 'language independent' action symbols (yet there's French on the board...couldn't they also print English?). Also, some of the role cards are clearly better than others leading me to wonder if this aspect of the game development could have been worked on: several cards were consistently untouched throughout the entire game.

You have to be switched on for 90 minutes and try to not compete with everyone else for the same thing. Ovebid and you could be hosed depending on your turn order. Also, a tip:make sure you have your economic engine set up (fishing etc) and your network connected (selling fish, building huts).

We got to play a few rounds in Essen, and the action selection mechanism looks absolutely intriguing: You have five tokens that you use to bid on actions. Then, whenever it is your turn, you have to choose one of your piles and take it back. If at that time it is the highest pile on that action, you are allowed to take the action. So you can put more tokens on one action to make sure you go first, but you can also bid less on multiple actions, and just wait until everyone else took their piles for those actions back and you have the highest remaining pile. Of course, if you aren't highest on any action when it is your turn, you have to take one pile back without being able to take any action, so you need to balance well how you place your tokens.

Besides that, I'm not entirely convinced of the game. It seemed to have quite some potential to shoot yourself in the foot in the first round by spending all your money without getting any income sources for it. Though I guess you can do that in many games.

Decent Euro showing off its French roots.  Lots of interaction.  If you like games where you need to overly plan out a dry luckless system and then throw it into the chaos mixer to see if your plans worked out, then this might be for you.  Often times there is a best choice available to you as you rarely have too many options, sadly, it is worth it to spend the extra minute or two to figure out if you are going to make more VPs and/or money off of every single option.  The trick of the game is to insure that you are able to take that optimal choice and to see if you can squeeze in one or two more helpful actions.  If you get the extra bits here and there you will push yourself farther ahead.  But after the point where you make the choice of how much you are going to push your actions, your game is subject to the whimsey of other players.  It is very likely that if you get too greedy or if other players plan to screw you your entire action sequence can become undone by the chain reaction of what you must and/or cannot do.  So if you like losing your turn, this might be fun.

I like the movement, but I wish it came in to play a bit more.  Often you just move to a couple places the whole game and just park there.  

I felt that the game runs about two or three turns too long.  At that point options dry up and then it is just rinse and repeat based on what clear moves are available to you.

Nice worker placement/role selection game that centers around sources of tourist cash in the South Pacific.  Thus, moving your boat to prime fishing areas or treasure caches is important, but perhaps not as much as shuttling tourists to islands where you have a lot of presence.  Interesting twists: (1) no hoarding cash, as every 10 vatus (cash) is immediately converted into 5 victory points, sending your cash reserves plummeting. (2) You return your character for the last round to the pool AFTER you've chosen your character for the next round, meaning that some players before you in turn order won't get a chance at your character.  (3) Most importantly, the way that workers get placed and resolved is unique, and generates some really nasty screwage.  Overall, there's enough new stuff in an attractive enough package to make me lobby to play it again.

Definitely a real cutthroat game, as the auction mechanism for actions can really mess with the order in which you take your actions, and that can be very costly.

Online play only (boiteajeux.net)

A cool worker-placement/action-selection game with potential for turn-order and worker-based player screwage! It has some interesting thematic connections, too. In a place where prestige comes from things other than money, you're forced to convert money to VP at set intervals (like in Sunrise City, for example): any time you get to 10+ money, you immediately spend 10 to buy 5VP. You also earn VP by making sand art (limited per island) and transporting tourists to various islands (assuming there are any huts there to accommodate them!). 

Each round starts by players selecting a special character for this round -- each modifies the basic actions in some way. Then, the worker placement phase: in order, place 2 of your "workers", then again, then again with the last worker. These may be placed on any of the action spaces, which give you a variety of actions (fish, sell fish, build hut, sail your ship, dive for treasure, create sand art for VP, buy/deliver cubes for VP, etc.). But the actions are resolved in turn order: on your turn, you must select one of the spaces and remove your workers from it. But you only get to take that action if you had the most workers there (or were tied but are earlier in turn order than the other tied players). If you don't manage your worker placements and turn order, you could conceivably not be able to take any actions at all!

The map slowly builds each turn, adding sea areas (for fish and treasure) and islands (for huts, drawings, cubes, tourist deliveries) until the board is full and the game ends. 

With the fixed number of actions available, I'd expect the game to get harder with more players; maybe 4 is the sweet spot?

This is one of those games that don't take prisioners! You have to do it right or you get eliminated. The ideas present in the game are very unique and also very easy to understand but only after one or two turns because players can only realize how much they've lost with their actions after playing and watching the results for the first couple of turns.
Much better with 3 than with 5. I imagine that with 4 is the best number to play with th whole spirit of the game but without too much chaos. I feel that I can control my destiny if playing with 3 players but not if I'm playing with 5. But maybe with 3 it's too easy to play the game because you have the same number of choices.
Vanuatu should have been a 3-4 player game only.
It's one of those negative interactive games that I usually don't like but in this case I like it because it's a different feeling of negativity. Also maybe the game could have 1 or 2 turns less and the playing order could be established to all players and not only the first player and clockwise from him, because player order is fundamental for tie breaking.

Oh my. This game is vicious - the whole hook and competition hangs around the action selection mechanic. And you can end up placing five action tokens and taking no actions if you have been very stupid, more likely you can end up only taking two whilst a smart opponent takes four - It creates an incredible tension and competition for scarce resources. Not only can you get screwed when selecting actions you can then get rear ended by the order that other gamers take theirs.

The rest is the usual sell stuff/deliver stuff (though thankfully simplistic without any flim flam)

The action selection is a stoke of genius - it has put my copy of Vasco Da Gama on the trade pile - a game for euro gamers who like it bloody in tooth and claw - and most certainly not for the squeamish or solitaire cube pusher

After second game a little less enamoured - the bits behind the action selection mechanic are a bit bog standard Euro - and  I wonder if the game will solely rest on its front - but what a wonderful front

Third game with five and enjoyed this number the most

RATING: 8
The sort of point salad where the the lettuce runs short and the chefs turn their knives on each other. Players spread their five discs across the available action spaces and then take turns removing them. A player must act if they can, but only the player with a simple majority of tokens (broken on turn order) can take a given action. If you can afford to wait for others to act first, then it's fine to only place one. Players are forced to take an action if they can and forced to remove discs to no effect if they can't, so this plays out with no small amount of malice: if players do have choice, optimal play is to ruin the plans of those who don't. Perhaps the worst outcome is to have a chain of actions cut by being denied the first requirement -- instead of move, fish and then sell fish, just stay where you are, fish for nothing in deserted waters and then sell the zilch you collect for nada.

The points-collection is smooth but not particularly interesting; the reason it's one of my eurogames of choice is the unusually high degree of interaction. It is somewhat sensitive to kingmaking, however (based on allowing or denying opportunities, deliberately or inadvertently) and the shifting majorities can encourage AP in disc placement.

Play can be highly negative so it is not a good choice for sensitive, gentle souls.

Choose actions. Move your boat, catch fish, discover treasure, build shacks, draw sand pictures, entice tourists. A bit of cash management, earn VPs. Each turn you need to choose up to 5 of 9 actions, but while the sequence of actions is usually important, you can easily find yourself having to choose which actions to forfeit, or executing your actions in an undesirable order. Even more annoying is the realisation that this often your own fault.

Lots of interesting mechanisms, but too much analysis paralysis with the action selection device. The theme kind of works, which is nice for a Euro. Still seems like a lot of AP for little gain. At the same time if you fail to plan the worker placement aspect can result in a turn where you do nothing.

My first and so far only play was marred by first not getting that the actions were not win/lose, and second by not getting that each sub-round, you lose one possible action if you can't take one. This action selection part of the game takes a lot of trial and error to make sure you get some actions and to spread your actions out so that you get as many as possible. I'm not entirely sure it's worth the trouble at this point.

Nth (N=?) play: I'm still not sure it's worth the trouble. The intricate part of the game is not in actually doing things, but in setting up things to be done. This is a little too meta for me to enjoy.

With three, the game was fun, if not a bit long. The timing of how to construct a turn and divide up your workers appropriately puts this on the very small list of worker-placement games I enjoy. Player interaction makes the game interesting; however, a three-player game was perhaps a bit too loose.

With four or five player the game tension is heightened, and, therefore, the game overall is more enjoyable. Nonetheless, the game is still a bit long for what it is. I think it feels this way because, while the selection mechanic is wonderful, the rest of the game is rather standard (but themed well!).

RATING: 6.5
Vanuatu is a pretty straightforward in a lot of respects. There are a bunch of actions you can take on a turn and some of them get you points, and some get you money (which is always tight). The thing that makes this game interesting is the way you select and resolve actions.

You get 5 action markers which you allocate every turn. You place them in three stages, everyone placing first two, then another two and a final one. When you resolve actions you may only choose an action where you have a plurality, or where you are tied and you're higher up in turn order than the people who you've tied with. Once you perform the action, you remove all your action markers from that action and it's someone else's turn... and the player who couldn't take that action where you had dominance now can.

It sounds fairly simple, but there are many opportunities to get screwed. Some actions, like showing the island to a tourist, are limited in how many people can get to do it in a round. So if there is only one tourist and multiple people fighting to take that action, some people are going to get screwed. Some actions are better if they are performed in a certain order... like being the person to sell the last item to a ship. And other actions are entirely order dependent... you can't fish until you sail to where the fish are. So if someone outnumbers you on an action spot, you might be delayed doing the action until it no longer makes sense. And you can always get in a bind where you have no action where you are dominant and you're forced to forfeit one of your remaining actions by removing your action markers from that spot.

The game can be nasty and can you get screwed out of doing what you want to do if you're not careful, or if someone picks a fight with you. Figuring out how to navigate the action selection method is the heart of this game and what I really love about it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Vanuatu has an interesting action drafting mechanic, aspects of which resemble area majority or bidding. You have five markers on actions you may want. Once all markers are placed, actions are chosen, but you can't take an action unless/until you have the plurality of markers on the action (ties broken by player order). If you can't take any action, you still discard your markers from one action. I thought I might dislike this as it might resemble an "all pay" auction, but it's mitigated by the fact that if the plurality-holder takes an action, others can use it later if they have not had to remove their markers yet.

While it's interesting, even after a full game I'm having trouble perceiving the best way to play it. Some things are quite clear: If you need to take an action that is dependent on having taken an earlier action (such as moving somewhere to do something), it's important to place enough markers to ensure you can do the first thing. And if you have a choice of which action to take, it can be good to refrain from taking actions that other players are waiting to use. So, perhaps it's good to "bid" on as many different things as you legally can, in order to be able to get through more rounds before you have to abandon the actions you really want.

I think the main downside of the game is that what you're actually competing to [i]do[/i] is not that interesting, and not much of it is usually available. There are limited opportunities in specific spaces to catch fish, dig up treasure, paint pictures on sand, bring tourists, build market stalls, buy goods (and limited demand to satisfy with them). Quite simple, dry, and short-term stuff.

This game is action selection and horrible AP, even with non-AP players, which killed it for me. AP is unavoidable because what you do depends on what other people are doing and you have to plan your actions accordingly and try to predict their actions as well. We played a 3 player game and it took us 2 hours probably. Taking into account that the rules aren't complicated and the actions are limited, that's a really long time. I can think of any number of 2 hour games I'd rather play.

Very impressive game with striking similarities to Kaivai, especially how the game rewards getting out of phase with other players. The action selection/programming mechanic in Vanuatu is both highly original and very engaging. There is an interesting shared development aspect to the game with temporary alliances that form based on shifting board position. The different moving parts are enough to give the game a rich texture with lots to consider yet rules wise the whole thing isn't that complex. Overall a refined and brilliant design. 

Note: I play without the character cards. They add considerably to game length and muddle the elegance of the design without any real payoff. The brutality of the game, which is what presumably the characters are there to assuage, is one of its main draws.

RATING: 6
I like games where the timing of your actions is critical to your success, and I like games where doing something just to hurt someone else will likely hurt yourself just as much (though taking an action that helps yourself AND hurts someone else is always an option).  Vanuatu has both characteristics, so I'm not surprised that I like it so far.  I like the way that the action selection mechanism is tied to having the majority, and the way that you can block people from certain actions by controlling the majority and by carefully selecting the order of your actions.  Some actions are tied to predecessors, which might force your hand, but that's not a bad thing.

The board is neat in that the tiles have a static formation for each game, but which tiles are in which locations will be different each time.  The different strategies seem fairly well balanced (a couple of us only bought goods twice in the game, while a couple of others cashed in on the two purple cube deliveries, and the scores were still pretty close), and there are several different ways to approach gathering points.  This is still a game of small progress being made each turn, and I think so long as that's known ahead of time (along with the understanding that you won't be able to do all the actions you selected each turn), it should be fine.

I look forward to playing this again, and even trying the game without the character cards.

Vanuatu is a very simple game. Like most worker placement games, the objective is to gather resources and convert them into Victory Points. In many games, that can be a long and complex path.  Not here. The VP paths are so simple and direct that this game should be completely forgettable. Fortunately, Vanuatu has an ace in the hole. The worker placement spaces are won by area majority. Not only that, but many of them are only effective if triggered in a sequence, a sequence that can be disrupted.

That changes everything. Instead of a simple race to grab spaces, it becomes a mind game. Bluffing about what is important to you, trying to push other players out of spots they want and in the resolution phase, tactically changing directions in order to make other players lose their actions by forcing them to execute actions out of order, nullifying them.

There is also a role selection mechanic, which again, on it's own is fairly one dimensional. When combined with the unique WP mechanism though, it amplifies the bluffing aspects. The roles are mostly modifiers, making the various WP spaces more profitable. Choosing a role then telegraphs to everyone what you want to do, making it that much easier for everyone else to disrupt that from happening.

The resulting AP is delicious. Every placement is an agonizing decision and when the resolution phase comes, the player interaction skyrockets as players disrupt each other with the order of their activations. In other words, this is a much heavier game than you might expect.

Love the cutthroat worker placement. However, the rest is just pushing wooden cubes around.

Amazing core mechanism to this game is wonderfully tense and offers some great opportunities to screw players over. It's a work genius.

A novel, and incredibly vicious turn selection mechanic.  Probably the best game I've played so far from Essen 2011.

Vanuatu has an original interesting mechanic, a variation of worker placement with majority and this single aspect of the game earns it this rating. Besides, there are multiple ways to earn points and different strategies, the game seems well balanced.
Unfortunately, Vanuatu lasts too long (i would say 6 turns would be better than 8). it plays a bit slowly and there isn't a tangible sense of growth, there is no developement in what a play can do, just a repeating over and over again of the same things.

Origineel arbeiderplaatsingsspelletje die voor lekker veel directe interactie zorgt.

Spelers zetten hun werkers in op verschillende acties. Ze mogen hun werkers ook op deelfde actie inzetten en hiermee een meerderheid veroorzaken op deze actie. Als iedereen de werkers heeft ingezet mogen alleen de acties uitgevoerd worden van de spelers die ergens in de meerderheid zijn. Als ze echter nergens de meerderheid hebben dan mogen ze geen actie uitvoeren en daardoor moeten ze een werker wegnemen. Dit zorgt er voor dat spelers elkaar behoorlijk dwars kunnen zitten.

Ontwerpers zijn iedere keer weer op zoek naar iets verfrissends en hiermee is er zeker weer iets gevonden.

Looks like a friendly Eurogame but has a distinct mean streak. Players can wreak havoc on each other's carefully laid plans. Plays a little long with five but there's lots of tension regarding whether you'll be able to do what you want. I would have liked to see a few more island tiles - there are plenty of other interesting Vanuatu islands that could have been included: Tanna with its active volcano, Pentecost with its land-diving or Malekula with its cannibal history.

Pre-ordered via Indiegogo and also received a t-shirt.

worker placement with aggressive blocking of actions, cool theme, nice art, smooth play and I didn't find the loss of actions due to the majority rules any more frustrating than some other games... some gamers don't seem to like this aspect, but we enjoyed the "aww crap!, I lost an action/couldn't do my actions in the right order" moments

I love how you bid for the actions by placing two action pawns at a time in turn order, followed by two more, and then your last remaining single worker (for 5 total). You then execute actions in turn order, one action at a time, but you are only able to execute the action if you have the majority (ties broken by turn-order). Wonderful mechanism!

The game looks good, it sort of feels like it could be a nice and sweet family game ala Settlers of Catan, but damn does it play nasty! This is one evil game of blocking, sabotaging and outplaying your opponents. You cannot get much more confrontational and interactive without actual direct conflict.

at the end of this game someone won't be your friend again. You can destroy the tactics of the other players and be destroyed to if you don't protect your investiment in actions.

Very interesting game. Highly confrontational, despite the peaceful theme and finish... maybe too much for the length of it. Spite in spades. If you can handle it, this is an excellent game of management and tactical play. Doesn't belong in my group though as those who like the confrontation don't enjoy the theme, and vice-versa.

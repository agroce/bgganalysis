Such a refined design - really marvelous in all qualities. The price point is a touch off putting - even considering the beautiful miniatures and overall production quality (and yet not using the amazing painterly illustrations to full effect) is quite good. The area control is brutally fun, the actions are brisk and streamlined. I love the theme! It feels very good to me - although the system is quite "Euro" in actions, the bumping off of opponents all across the board is very thematic. Keeping scoring secret all through the game ensures uncertainty and dampens "king making". Although still - if a player gets control of the districts, that player will certainly have tremendous action advantage and thus become the target of everyone else! I like it!

The Godfather: Corleone's Empire is an incredible strategy game that sort of threw my friends off. I'm assuming they thought the game wouldn't be that fun, seeing as it's based on a movie none of them have seen, but it even surprised myself. Each person takes control of a crime family and must strategically take control of different districts of New York City to make profit. Whoever makes the most profit at the end of 4 Acts (rounds) wins, however it's easier said than done. Players can kill members of your crew, attack businesses, and you could find yourself doing well one round but then in a gang war the next. Very fun game and only takes roughly an hour or so.

Okay, so I did enjoy the combination worker placement / area control. However, that interesting game design was then merged with a ridiculous 'take that' quest system. The quests (while thematic) quite simply allow you to target players and really basically take them out of the game. I will likely not play this game again.

Really fun area control game with a solid amount of thinking, and a splash of table-diplomacy and take that mixed it. One thing I really love is that, even though basically all info being open, I am still frequently surprised by the outcome of the game. I've had several games where the person at the table considered to be in the weakest position has snuck into first or second while the perceived "top 2" were busy warring it out.

Dude knows how to design worker placement games.  This one isn't as good as blood rage, but is a completely different beast as a worker placement / area control game.  The mobster theme really comes through, and the game ramps up perfectly.  The components are well done, however some of the graphic design choices don't look "Top of the line" type quality... which at this point we all expect from CMON.  This will probably end up being a special game, and I expect to be one of the top games of 2017.

RATING: 6
An entirely derivative mishmash of worker placement to get resources to fulfill contracts, which leads to set collecting of said contracts. The placed workers also lead to area control.
Think of how many games you know that go something like this: place a meeple worker in one space to get a yellow cube, place another worker elsewhere for a blue cube. Trade yellow and blue cube for x VPs on your fulfillment. 
Really, it's a rather simplistic recycling of tried and true mechanics seen hundreds of times elsewhere. There is zero original game play here. This game will appeal to the fans of The Godfather movies, though the execution is a generic New York gangster theme, and it is rather detached anyways. 
This game will also appeal to all the Eric Lang fanboyz, no matter whether the game is any good or not; or has a shred of originality.

It is WAY over-the-top produced; so bit-whores, and minis-freaks will go gaga over it.

Rating is 5. But add 1 for the over produced bits.

The lack of theme is offensive to the movie franchise.  As much depth as the movies possess, this game lacks it. Don’t put Vito Corleone on the cover, then stuff the box with a game of mindless thuggery that likely took a solid ten minutes to design.  Not even playtested, as our end game collapsed completely.

A smooth worker placement game with bite. It's a multi-layered game that's pretty streamlined at the surface. Place dudes down to gain resources. The goal is to acquire money and then funnel that in to your tin suitcase via laundering. 

The area control element is a significant part of the game, but it doesn't quite feel like an area control game to me. It definitely feels more like a worker placement design with an additional aspect you must consider. 

Confrontation in this game is accomplished via jobs, and is not direct. You can't simply place down some guys and go to war. This means it doesn't really feel like Sons of Anarchy at all, a design it's been compared to.

It also means the game is more incremental and less dynamic. The comparisons to Blood Rage are off in my opinion. It has a similar round management aspect similar in feel to the Rage mechanism, but that's about it. There's no grand combat here and Quests do not feel like jobs. Additionally, every figure is removed off the board here in between Acts (rounds) which offers a different dynamic and tempo.

This is a high quality game that's fun to play, and certainly one of my favorite worker placement designs--a genre I'm not too enamored with. It won't unseat Sons of Anarchy but it slots in nicely next to Champions of Midgard as a solid title worth keeping.

Whether you're a fan of the film series or just a fan of great board games, this is a fantastic experience! Played this several times with friends and we've always had an absolute "blast" no pun intended. 

The game was fairly easy to learn and has beautiful artwork and figures.

There is a fair amount of strategy involved as well as a balanced buff and deck system.

The game plays in stages and acts. The game doesn't take too long and as the acts move forward the game becomes exponentially more interesting and brutal. 

I Love it!

RATING: 9
Rated 9 after one play. This exceeded my expectations. I've been a fan of Eric Lang's work, and the idea of a thematic mid-weight worker placement game sounded good enough to me. (Weirdly, despite the worker placement genre explosion, I really don't own many worker placement games.)

A read through the rules doesn't do this game justice. There's a lot more nuance and decision angst than one might imagine from reading the streamlined ruleset. A lot of that angst comes from weighing the need to get the actions you want, while also trying to leverage the most out of area control. Little rules like "the player controlling the turf gets the benefit of business shake downs as well" and "at the end of round you have to discard down cards that you weren't able to suitcase" add plenty of tension and are there for a very impactful reason.

That's a recipe for a great design in my book. Slim and approachable ruleset, straightforward turns, yet plenty of decision angst and player interaction... great stuff. And it's playable in 1.5 hours.

Regarding theme, it felt plenty mobster-like, with mechanics reinforcing the idea of running a mob. Is it Godfather-specific? I dunno... I'm not sure how you work that specifically into the game. Frankly, I'll take a solid game over shoehorning movie-specific elements in it for the heck of it.

1. Overlapping worker placement with area majority is excellent.
2. Low-cost "make everyone else discard" cards in a hand-management game are really obnoxious and un-fun - particularly when three people play one in a row first thing in a round.
3. Different artwork for each job would have been nice.
4. Wow, do I hate demos which simply truncate a game after round #N with no compensatory tweaks. Sure, you get an idea of the gameplay, but usually you get little to no idea of the game *arc*.

Nice combination between worker placement and area control; also set collection and some bidding in it; theme as a mob game is very well intertwined, although The Godfather theme in particular is not present at all, which does not matter to me; plays smoothly; simple rules, but enough depth; actions should be considered carefully; conflicts by getting in each other’s way and possibility to gun down figures of other players.

An interesting area control, people on a map game with a pop culture theme. We played with 5 players and right off the bat there are elements of the theme tying into the conflict being represented on the board. Having two types of figures that can be placed on two separate spots makes some interesting choices when they should be put out based on the state of the map. I liked that the bases for these figures are either circles or squares - this made it easy to see what could go where. 

The rating for our play was really knocked down in the final act when it just ended because there were no more circle spots on the board and that was all anyone had left. The player who had the police chief ally failed to play it soon enough, which would have opened up spots, and there were no car bomb jobs in play. To have the game end when everyone still has 2-3 figures left was not the epic ending anyone was hoping for. It feels like the car bomb and police chief are required to clear out the board and let the act continue. Without that, the game can find itself in an odd state where you simply have a peaceful coexistence in the city, contrary to the theme from the story.

So far, I've been underwhelmed, perhaps expecting more from an Eric Lang game.

Visually, the board and minis are great and it has some has unique area-control aspects in which a single one of your characters can be in one area (gaining stronger bonuses) or several areas at once (gaining better area-control ground). 

The card play is where I find a few problems. First-off there are too many cards that allow you to just wipe people off the board. I know, I know this is The Godfather ... but there is no real strategy to the kills -- just pick up the prerequisite cards and then go kill.  Especially if a majority of the kill cards show up early. You feel like you're just killing to kill and complete a job card. 

Completing the jobs is pretty much essential to do well in the game -- 1. They can get you victory points at the end of the game, but 2. More importantly, they delay you having to place all your figures on the board, extending your round. If you can be the last-man standing (everyone else having to pass because they ran out of figures) that's a huge advantage to take a couple unchallenged turns. So, again, I almost feel like I'm doing a job against an opponent just for the sake of hanging around ... there's a disconnect there.

The themeing and variety of the cards could be better, too. All the kill cards, for example, are sort of the same -- no real flavor on how the kill went down, etc. And there are basically slightly different versions of same actions -- kill 1 player, kill 2 players, etc. -- instead of a larger variety of single unique cards that let you do a lot of different things. 

Ultimately, I feel as if the game design was a little rushed and not fully built out to its potential.

As a light-to-medium, mafia-themed worker placement and area control game, Corleone's Empire is fine. There's a lot to like about it, although nothing blew me away (pun intended) as particularly innovative or unique. However, this could be the new poster child for unnecessary overproduction in board gaming. It's a $40 game in an $80 package of minis and IP.

One play at the two player count, will rerate after repeated plays. (I've added an addendum). Upshot =This is a great game with a few problems.

Really tight worker placement game, with an area control element, with set collection and some meanness. It's fun. It's easy to teach. The components looks great. I prefer this to blood rage at the two player count. It's more of a Euro than that game and different from your usual worker placement game.

Few issues. Firstly this game isn't better than a good game you can buy for thirty quid. You're paying for components that you do not need. I'd rather the thugs were meeples, there is no need for individual sculpts. The godfather theme is not more than a gangster theme, the most irrelevant component is perhaps the round marker, which is a mini of the don himself. 

The components are great however, the trunks are nice, though they also hike up the price. Though I would argue that they do add quite a bit to the game. I dislike the graphic design on the cards. The artwork through the manual however is amazing. 

There are a few clarity issues with the map, which though attractive isn't perhaps as functional as it could have been. 

Update, another play at five and three. Further plays have increased my affection for this game that I liked from the off. Both of my addition plays were excellent. It's fair to say that this game is good at all the counts, I can't imagine four being bad. I still feel the game is over produced, but the game is fun and thematic. In parts it's feels slightly sterile and thinky, which feels thematic in a way as the organisation of criminals would be cold and objective, I imagine. The whole it's business not personal vibe from the godfather.

I prefer blood rage and chaos to this overall. However this is the more diverse game, it's simpler to explain then both of those, less opaque than both with a more robust and diverse player count that both. Though it's harder to see who is winning at any one time in this game. I'd only play chaos with 4. Blood rage I'd avoid with two. This is good two through five. It's simpler than both those two so will perhaps get more play. Time will tell, 

A solid 8.

I really like this game. Very quick to set up and has great pacing. Majority of the group I played with don't really play board games but they all enjoyed this game and are wanting to play again.  The rules and mechanics are easy to grasp yet the game still manages to have a good amount of depth. Even without having seen The Godfather, the game still has plenty of theme and I especially love how the action ramps up near the final Acts. Really recommend this game especially if you want to introduce some people to board gaming. I do have one minor complaint though and its that the job cards could've benefited from having unique art instead of the same box art being used. Other than that this is a very solid game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
The only knock I have on the game is that the there is a theme and mechanic disconnect. Does it give a mobster/Godfather feel? Eh, sort of. The game does lean more towards the mechanical side where I am not thinking about what will feel very gangster but rather what I can do that will net me the best points (money) return. The jobs and rewards for them do work and feel legit but district influence felt mechanical and that replicates in other aspects of the game where some work well, others feel gamey. Now that said the game is easy to get into, the rules are solid and distilled to what is needed without being overly fluffy or full of rules exceptions and it plays well. MSRP I feel is a bit high but production is great though different art on the job cards more reflective of the job would have gone a long way to reinforcing the theme and for the price I almost expect that. Overall though a solid offering and one I will look forward to playing.

I might try it again...But, I just didn't care for the gamey and or; over simplistic mechanics. It does have nice components and cards. But, the map is a bit too dark, and with many of the symbols being too small. It could have been a bit easier to read. Biggest beef, is as long as the players have the requirements to do a job. It happens where and when they want it to. Also, too many drive by's and car bombs that can be counted on. One turn in the game it had happened so much that there were no more targets. There were 8 guys in the river mid-turn already. Players know too much and have too much control. Despite the chaotic card play and having to keep resetting their forces every turn. I don't know if there was a developer for this game. But, IMHO it needed one.

This is another thematic game that relies on players excitement for the subject matter to take them past any faults the game may have. As I have not watched the movies, I had to assess the game based on game play.

The game works as a so-so worker placement with an added area control element. I think a lot of people will compare it to Lords of Waterdeep, since random locations are added to the board and extra workers are rewarded as the turns click by. I found it odd that they spent sooo much energy into the production of the plastic figures (which I suppose is the namesake of the company) and less time on the art production of those hideous "goods" cards. It felt like a vehicle to simply sell people "cool minis".

It does succeed in delivering a theme, so I'm sure Godfather fanboys will be getting a boner for this one.

The Theme comes through very well- extort businesses, gun down rival thugs, gain control of NYC territories (which changes often)...the only thing missing is negotiation (which would've made the game rise another level). But fun for what it is. It starts off simple, and the rounds are divided into 5 acts. As players pass through each act, the game intensifies & adds more into the mix in the way of additional gangsters, making decisions more & more critical. Quite enjoyable & without needless complexity. One of the best gangster themed games out there. I would pick this over Blood Rage if choosing games at this level.

Mechanics are simple: place a Thug (square base) in a business and get that benefit, 
place a Capo (circular base) on a border to get all the back-end benefits in the connecting areas, or complete a job and change the board state. At the end of every round, count up the influence of your Thugs and Capos and, if you're ahead of your opponent, place an influence marker in that area. Now, every time an opponent sends a Thug to a business in that area, you get the benefit too. In between rounds, allies are auctioned off that further let you mess with the board state. The main scoring mechanism is banking the money cards you get in hand by placing Thugs and Capos in locations with the briefcase icon. You also get money at the end of the game for having the most influence in the area and for having the most jobs completed of one color type.

All that sounds good and pretty straightforward but what is the ultimate undoing of the game is the theme and how it plays upon the mechanics. Since we're playing gangsters of course there have to be drive-bys, gun-downs, and car bombs. One simple card pull can devastate your best-laid plans in the blink of an eye while adding one more job card to the player who completed it. This makes for a very swingy game that relies a bit too much on what cards you pull. 

I could play it once or twice more but I've had my fill as it is.

I am probably under rating this game. It's a solid game. I typically don't like a ton of conflict in my games and this has it in spades. Being a learning game, I didn't realize exactly how the suitcase worked in my first play, which left me without an ally after the first round (as I had no money with which to bid) and that put me behind the entire game. I also found this to be very luck driven. Four times I pulled job cards and got two of the exact same card every time (which didn't align with the resources I was collecting), while the guy next to me got Car Bomb twice and laid havoc with the board because of it. I think this game could go to a 7.5 on my scale, but not much higher and it's not a game I will often request, or buy.

The Godfather is a worker placement/area control game. Unique but mechanical in an Eric Lang way, Godfather is simple to play and (mostly) full of engaging moments. Where players choose locations also determine area control for later in the game. This small addition makes for an excellent design choice. On the downside, some location are too simple, and with only a few "resources" to manage that fuel the same few jobs, The Godfather can outstay its welcome. The theme is wonderful, though. This is done very well in that being a more complex game, can be easily used as a gateway game. The suitcase mechanic is good, but too many times during the game players have to manage their "suitcase hand" and regular hand of cards. I would like to see some of these ideas fleshed out a bit more. As of now, it lacks consistent important decisions. If Lang chooses to revisit this game in the future, I will surely be attentive. As is, Godfather is a nice game. It is not as perennial as some of Lang's other greats, but there is plenty of enjoyment to be had here.

Unfortunately this game is not as good as I expected it to be. I can see Eric Lang combining both worker placement and area control into a single game. But the job cards are too swingy for an area control game. In a game where you only start with 3 "workers" it is quite devastating to lose any one of them from job cards. Also the game feels like its quite repetitive after a few rounds. I would have rated this a 5, but upped the ratings to a 6 purely due to the excellent production of the game.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (October 2017)

As soon as I found out that The Godfather: Corleone's Empire was a Cool Mini or Not game, my desire to play it plummeted. I have disliked every game I have played from this publisher. In general, I found their games gorgeous, but very shallow. I feel they put a lot of effort on the aesthetic part of the game while they don’t do the same to the gameplay, thus, every game I have played has disappointing me. Having saying this, I enjoyed my play of The Godfather: Corleone's Empire, but it is still not a game for me.

The game´s rules aren’t complex, but there are many of them, so you can probably explain them all under 15 minutes. Playtime is more than 2 hours.

The theme is rather nice, I enjoyed it although I have never seen the movie nor I have any interest in doing so.

As most area control games, it is best played with 4-5 players. With less, the experience is much less fun.

The game´s components are good, but Cool Mini or Not has trained me to expect better from them. Due to the high cost of the game, I was expecting better components. For some reason, I don’t like the art on the cards nor on the board. I was disappointed to see that every category of the job cards has the same art on them :/.

The Godfather: Corleone's Empire is an area control game mixed with worker placement and lots of “take that” (a mechanism I no longer enjoy in most games). The decisions needed to play the game aren’t very hard/deep, but you have to think them through. You have two kinds of gangsters, casual or professionals, and in each turn you need to do an action or pass. Every time you play a gangster, you do it for the action and to control that area, I like this, it makes the game harder and much more interesting. It has a light-medium weight.  As I wrote before, the game has a lot of “take that”, many of your gangsters will end up in the river. I dislike this mechanism (in most games, not just in this one) because it is used to attack the perceived leader (although here the VPs are secret) or to make revenge attacks on someone that attacked you before. In this instance, it doesn’t matter how well you play, if you get attacked a lot you don’t stand a chance at winning the game. It also lend itself to kingmaking situations (another facet I heavily dislike). The mechanisms of the game aren’t novel in any way.

There is a healthy dose of luck with the cards, but you can control it a little bit at least. I think the jobs are unbalanced and you randomly draw them, for example, you can steal money from an opponent’s suitcase, that seems very powerful.

I have seen the game discounted a lot lately, so I’m not sure if it is doing ok or not. For my part, I almost never buy Cool Mini or Not games, they simply don’t make the games I tend to like.

Bottom line, I wasn’t expecting much from The Godfather: Corleone's Empire but the game surprised me and I had fun playing it. There is a considerable amount of luck with the cards, but you can control it a bit. Still the decisions needed to play the game are rather easy. I no longer enjoy “take that” games, I hate when players destroy each other plans, thus decreasing the strategy factor of the game, Having said that, I recognize The Godfather: Corleone's Empire is a solid design and and a fun one if you enjoy attacking your opponents. It is much better/interesting than Blood Rage, I think it is the best Cool Mini or Not game I have played to date (not counting Lorenzo il Maginifico that isn't their design and I really liked it), but still, my desire to play it again remains low. It would be much more interesting to me if the game time was less than 60 minutes.

RATING: 6
One play only which got of to a stuttering start after a chaotic rules explanation. I get the comparisons with Eric Lang's Blood Rage (area control, similar turn sequence) but this game lacks Blood Rage's subtlety. The special powers combos and on board interactivity are replaced by more basic area control and take-that cards.
More experience may mitigate, but as the mission cards weren't explained (so I didn't know what was coming). I was completely hosed three times by the gotcha cards which seemed to be disproportionately powerful.
The game slowed to a crawl on the last two turns, As first player I was out of options before  the others meaning on the last two turns I was uninvolved for 10 minutes at the end of each turn. Thankfully there is a nice garden close to where we played so I could enjoy some fresh air while the others agonised over there last few plays.
Good, but not great.

2017-10-04 - I was expecting this to be mostly an area control game, but it's kind of half and half, area control and worker placement. The worker placement is pretty simple, and doesn't get truly interesting until the area control comes into play in the second round. I'm not sure the Godfather IP really shines, but the games is definitely good.

Solid area majority / worker placement game. It's very euro with a non-euro theme. There is some take that, but seeing your posse end up in Hudson River is not that heartbreaking unless it is only your posse down there. The art production has been a bit lazy. Marlon Brando's Don Corleone is iconic, but they could have had some variation on the job cards. Additionally the illegal goods art may be functional, but it is pretty ugly.

Each worker you place, you do both for the action, and the majorities: having two types of workers, plus the ability to delay placement by playing cards, makes for an intense play, especially once Gun missions start being played and bodies pile up.

Not a bad game, but doesn't do enough to distinguish itself from Lang's prior, similar releases.

Straightforward resource processing worker placement game with Eric Lang's signature tactical miniature-killing game mechanics seen in every single one of his releases. While this game iterates slightly on his other miniature/area control games, I felt that it didn't do enough new things to warrant replacing, for instance, blood rage. While the design and balance felt tight, for being a themed game, it didn't feel very thematic - particularly in the way the resources (weapons, booze, money), quests, and locations functioned - as deeply generic resources (essentially wooden cubes) and resource processing puzzles akin to the simplest, driest euros (i.e. Lords of Waterdeep...).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Traded - wasn't getting play. I still like the game but it works best with 5 and is fine with 4. Any other number not so much. 

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Lang does area control really well. This is another solid design which is quite fun and while it has an AT theme is more of a euro in how it plays (although quite a few gangsters still get dumped in the river. Minis are quite nice as expected. Game plays quickly over four rounds. Be sure to be prepared going into the fourth and final round and expect a bloodbath. Must admit I didn't see a connect to the movie at all - although the mob theme came through. Might be good to make everyone aware of the different jobs so one can prepare for them (IE, the one that lets a mobster steal 3 money from an opponent's suitcase can be a bit jarring if unexpected/unplanned for). I expect the game will be best with five and solid with four. Not sure I'd be interested in playing with less people.

Interesting mixture between worker placement, hidden victory points and backstabbing. The game plays flawless, all mechanics are perfectly integrated.
Actions are not only provided by your workers, but also via jobs, and the trick is to time them perfectly. Jobs can be applied with resources or by bidding secretly with money that has been put into your suitcase. And then there is the discard phase at the end of each round... arghh, this game requires good planning. I love it!!

The Godfather, like Blood Rage, is a melding of Euro and Thematic gameplay.  First the game places out a new building.  Then you take actions.  You are placing thugs that can go into the front of business and get either booze, guns or blood money.  Family members allow you to do multiple “back door” actions.  You collect these cards along with money and fulfill jobs which use a combination of those cards.  The more cards you turn in the more powerful the action and you put them in your suitcase.  You get also have actions where you put money in the suitcase as well.  Some jobs allow you to kill off other players thugs and family members.  After all tokens are played, you can bid on allies.  You spend money to acquire them.  These cards count against your hand limit and they get more powerful as the game goes on.  Cash is in 5, 3, 2 and 1 denominations.  You never get change.  After you bid on allies, you discard down to the number of cards you can hold.  You then start a new turn and play four turns.  

The game is great.  It is mid-weight but has depth just like Blood Rage .  The only thing I dislike is that card art is the same on all the jobs.  The miniatures are great but I will have to paint them.  Overall a fun experience.  I am a fan of the movies but you don’t have to be a fan to like this game.

Too few ressources, so many tunrs were just playing rather useless actions to wait until someone finally spends them again.

Only played twice so far but really enjoyed both games.
This kinda reminds me of Lords of waterdeep with worker placement to collect resources to complete jobs for the Godfather. Has the right amount of "take that" giving it a gangster theme. The family members (workers) you place also score towards area control and the end of each round and I like the feel of the metal briefcase each player has to secretly bank their laundered cash.
Rules are fairly simple too.

A fantastic area control game with worker placement, set collection and take-that mechanics.

Plays at approx 30 mins per player.

Godfather theme is light, given that nothing that happens in the game has anything to do with the movies. Fails from that perspective... but excels as a generic mob game where you're using your thugs and influencers to shake down businesses, gain resources and complete objectives.

The Godfather: Corleone's Empire is a ton of fun, but your group has to enjoy the cutthroat style game play. Tons of smart designs that add up to be a fantastic game. 

There are lots of things to consider with each action. The worker placement determines your reward, (adding, defending or preventing) turf influence, and possible free shakedown actions for other players. Timing your actions is important since you cannot play job or ally cards if you have no family or thugs. If you wait too long, you might miss a critical placement, but if you place too soon you might forfeit lucrative actions. 

The board is always tight if players are paying attention to each other and even though businesses are added, more family become available as well. Some spots are more valuable which makes them highly contested, but you can't ignore your opponents cherry picking the less valuable turfs.

Knowing what your opponents add to their briefcase gives you perfect information about score, but requires you to keep pay attention. Tracking which jobs have been played and are out of rotation gives you some idea of what is still in play, informing your decisions. 

Theme? Sure, wiping out an entire turf of enemies with a car bomb, getting free stuff when someone tries to shakedown a business in your turf, taking control of a turf because you exert more influence over it, getting wacked because you spread yourself too thin or muscled in on the wrong crew, gaining an ally in high places with a well placed bribe, etc. I don't know how you could make it any more thematic, but I'm not a die hard fan of Godfather, so maybe they missed a trick. (I doubt it.)

I had zero interest in this game, even after seeing reviews, until someone pointed out it was worker placement - a mechanic I like - which I'd somehow missed in my overall disinterest in the game.  Demo'ed it and instantly bought it.  It's extremely tight, but in different ways depending on how the shops open, and has a lot going on but it's also very easy to teach.  I also finally got a game with narcotics (Which makes the later rounds less tight).  Very good production values and mean, but not in a way that I've ever seen really upset someone.

I've seen this go over very well with a variety of people, including people I wouldn't have expected.

Very cool game... it can be very chaotic and with a lot of Take That so you have to be aware of that when you sit down to play this one, you can make plans but be ready for those plans to be messed up by the other players.

The Minis and Suitcases are great... just wish that the Job Cards were more varied and had different artwork on them.

I love this game. It's ruthless but fun. You never feel angry when your perfect plan goes up in smoke, but a sense of bewilderment. Didn't give it 10 stars just because the artwork on the cards feels a little bit lacking, specially compared to the minis.

RATING: 7
I really wanted to like this more than I did. However, there are a few too many flaws to this game to make me want to rate it any higher.

While boasting minis and high production values, Corleone's Empire is yet another game where the Godfather theme feels fairly thin. You are sending gangsters around to complete tasks, and you handle items like firearms and drugs, but that's about as thematic as it gets. I don't consider myself a Godfather efficianado, but even the family names in this game weren't ones I recognized. It would have been more appropriate to include playable families like the Straccis and the Barzinis.

Mechanically, this is a cross between Blood Rage and Lords of Waterdeep. It has that limited sense of action-taking along with that pseudo-area control that Blood Rage has, and the overall flow of the game feels like a Lords of Waterdeep-esque worker placement game. At the end of the day, that's really all you're getting here. Rounds of the game are given titles relating to the movie, but there's almost no tie-ins at all aside from that. 

This is simply a game of churning resources into points. There's some decision-making regarding what cards you're going to keep in your hand from round to round, and the placement of your people requires thought about what rewards you get and what areas you have majority in. Still, the game goes on a round too long, in my opinion. All the missions will be spoken for, and the final turns around the table will feel like you're just spinning your wheels. You don't have to worry about getting anything done right away, because most likely you'll have time to do everything you want to do. Granted there is some resource hoarding and timing of when you want to complete missions, but I see both of these things as artificial, if anything.

I think a great fix to this game would have been to introduce the Heir character in the 3rd round, and remove your Godfather character in the 4th round. This would have given the game a better sense of flow (Not to mention being slightly more thematic), and wouldn't make the final round of the game so tedious and uninteresting.

It just goes to show that CMON's games tend to usually be amateur-ish designs that require more play-testing. Eric Lang is mostly to blame on this, and I fear that the combination of both will yield some pretty unspectacular games. I would much rather play Blood Rage or Chaos in the Old World over this, even though those themes don't interest me nearly as much. Blood Rage is the one CMON game I've played that actually felt adequately play-tested, despite the possibility of runaway leaders.

Is the game fun? Sure, it's enjoyable...with a full compliment. Any less and don't bother. Regardless, this was supposed to be THE Godfather game, and I wouldn't rank it any higher than the stuff IDW has put out. In fact, A New Don remains my favorite game with the Godfather moniker, even if it is pasted on, at best. At least that game didn't pretend to be something it wasn't. Corleone's Empire is a disappointment, but not a disaster. Euro gamers will probably eat this one up, though there are a few mission cards that can be a little heavy-handed in the take-that category for some.

Take the rating as you will, but I don't like these sorts of player vs player games.

The production value of the games seems to be half-assed at best. Looks like someone did 1/2 the job and then handed it over without finishing. The resource cards (guns/booze/blood money) seem to have just used clipart, the job cards have exactly the same picture on every one. Compared with the ally cards and the board art is really nice and evocative of the era.

Game play? Well it's a worker placement with area control. Plenty of take that mechanisms that you will either love or hate, and I fall into the latter camp on that. 

There's just no fun spending a turn planning and placing to have someone decide, directly or indirectly, to wipe out your workers.

My 2nd most anticipated game for 2017. It doesn't quite live up to where I hoped it would be, but it is really good still. It is not a thematic game for sure, but it is a solid game, with plenty of player interaction and direct conflict when you want it. Can be a bit player driven chaos in the game though.

RATING: 7
Decent. A nice mix of simple mechanics. Fun to lock your money away in the briefcase tins. Enough "take that" to punish a player permanently though, so that's a con for me. Took longer to play than I would have expected - players tend to mull over all the combinations on the board when placing a worker. Since this is also different every game, it may always take some time.

I have played this game twice now. I won the second game by like 20 points lol it was great.   The game it self is beautiful to look out. Its an area control game with some unique mechanics.  The game has some take that to it. Its not over done but its there . I think its pretty balanced overall. Every one has access to do drive by's or car bombs.  The theme is pretty good I feel like a little more could of been done with the gangster theme other then just naming the cards and actions after gangster style things. I also kind of wish the family has something to make them a little unique . Overall the game is pretty streamlined and easy to learn.

Another instant Eric Lang classic! Rules are read and explained in ~20 minutes and are very easy to grasp and free of any slack. The game however from the first round onwards (and increasingly from there) brings a ton of options to let the players design their strategy and fine-tune their tactics. Great player interaction, a lot of deep area control, some worker placement and hidden auction bidding. Just pure fun! 

Plan a little more than the 90 minutes though, even with - or especially with - experienced gamers who like to think through their options well, cause their is a lot to consider with every move. 

I also have to say - as always with CMON - the material and artwork is beautiful and of high quality. Went to the top of my "have to paint these minis" list right after the first game.

I would consider this a great "Friday night game".  A lot more on the light-hearted / humorous side rather than epic side.   It's very entertaining, 10-15 minutes to explain to new players, and very volatile (anyone at the table can win).  Eric Lang shows once again depth in the spectrum of what he can deliver.

Fun area control game. The game we played, it was a tight 1st and 2nd place. 5 players plays too long for me, so I recommend 4 players for 1 to 1.5 hour playtime. The game can be an AP trap if you have those type of players in your group. Overally, I recommend it because it doesn't rely on dice-rolling, rather you need good strategic thinking.

German review: https://peterrustemeyer.wordpress.com/2017/08/04/angespielt-der-pate/

I'd rate it somewhere between 7 and 8 on gameplay. 
A nice take on the worker placement genre: 
1. The Workers are also used for area control. 
2. Controlled sites offer rewards for the owner (similar to Lords of Waterdeep).
3. You cannot "hoard", there's a brutal penalty for too many hand cards.

But it's just overproduced and therefor incredibly expensive. 
There's no way I pay 80 Euro for a little WP game.
And it's lacking theme, doesn't take advantage of the IP of the Godfather at all.

I am the one who buy games because of theirs themes and artwork. And I love these 2 points of Godfather. I think the mechanics might not be "wow". it is just an area control game and hand management. But I like that some job cards have truly nuke effects. Some people might think it make game unbalance. But I think it suits well with the theme. This kind of "too strong effect" also make me feel I am a prey which means its theme is super powerful. It is also good for my friends who do not like to get a block, wood, or steel as a resources of the game. For them, collecting drug, guns, or blood money sounds more fun.

RATING: 8.5
The Godfather is a very underrated game that thankfully has little to do with the films. Since I am not a fan of the films I was hesitant to play this but glad that I did. It instead slickly integrates a 1950's mobster theme. What a welcome addition to the largely theme-less worker placement games already out there. It is a worker placement game with style and just the right amount of take that. If you were on the fence and love high quality components, serious give this a try you will not be disappointed.

Pros:
* High quality components
* Mobster theme is integrated well
* Streamlined game play

Cons:
* Fans of the films may be disappointed

Very similar to Lords of Waterdeep but greater depth.  The decisions are complex with so many possibilities. Because of the depth, the game takes longer to play than LoW. The job cards can alter the situation significantly so the game is difficult at every turn. I especially like the idea of banking the completed jobs (missions) as well as the decisions concerning when to bank money (victory points) and what to keep in your hand at the end of a turn.

RATING: 9
A superb blend of worker placement, resource management and take-that gameplay. The Godfather: Corleone's Empire is Eric Lang & Karl Kopinski's love letter to the Coppola classic. It brings in the theme and feel of The Godfather's New York, but through original concept art and new characters, breathes new life into a classic tale. 

The beautifully sculpted minis bring Kopinski's artwork right onto your board so you can extort businesses, launder money and even send your enemies to sleep with the fishes. Layered gameplay means that you have to consider what resources, money and job cards you have before you choose to move in on any turf or start making enemies. Choose your enemies wisely and your friends carefully, as crime is a dangerous business. 

From a selection of business tokens that vary with each game combined with the wide selection of job cards and ally cards, no two games will ever be the same. There are enough variables to keep gameplay fresh and exciting even after a dozen games.

A beautiful board game (not just for Godfather fans).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This might be my new go-to game for eliminating each others gangsters.

It plays like a combination of Tom Vasel's 'Nothing Personal' gangster game and more typical area-control games like Ticket To Ride. That possibly makes it better than Nothing Personal, which is hampered by a mathy 'cascading, domino-effect pyramid of influence' device and excessive catch-up mechanisms. Having said that, Nothing Personal can be a riot of daft fun and negotiation whereas The Godfather boils down to simple mechanisms (see below).

This game is very easy to teach. It is lean and there's nothing obviously innovative in it.

It doesn't resemble The Godfather films, beyond its gangster theme. It feels more like you're controlling rioters as they move around the city.

The miniatures are great and the board is ok but the cards are boring - some looking like clipart. I'm growing suspicious of the designer Eric Lang and his vehicles to persuade people pay a lot for fancy miniatures. It also means the box is about three times the size it would otherwise need to be.

My concern is that the general area control etc is very obvious, whereas you can only make truly good decisions if you bother to remember what combinations of cards other players have in their hands ... which I find a headache. Still, people seem to put up with games like Ticket To Ride, which have a very similar 'problem'.

Despite this game's huge cutthroat theme, there are bigger thrills (and more fiery battles) to be had from other area-control games like the supposedly dry Hansa Teutonica, Bruxelles 1893 and Imperial 2030.

Played once. With 5 players, we ran out of job cards very early in the last round, which made it play very differently than the previous rounds. There are lots of interesting decisions to make, which is good, but some players had AP, causing our game to go almost 3 hours. And oftentimes, after they would spend all of that time deliberating over where to place someone, their plans would be laid to waste by a car bomb or a drive-by. Because it's a mobster theme, the ability to decimate opponents makes sense, but it really adds to the luck factor (and kingmaking). In the end, I won by 14 dollars, through a combination of good decisions and a good dose of luck. In particular, I was just able to gain control of 3 turfs in the end.

(8 plays)

 This game is a lesson in masterful design. It captures so many different things in such an elegant and smooth way. It is fast, simple (almost gateway tbh), brutally interactive, insanely thematic (although not strongly connected to the actual Godfather movie). However, it represents the Mobster theme in a beautifully streamlined package that is simple to play but offers a lot of depth. It plays surprisingly great with just two players but I am really looking forward to playing with more people. I also think it's better than Blood Rage (blasphemy right), because it is much more streamlined and it achieves a lot of the core concepts of that game with less book keeping. I also enjoy the thugs on a map theme way more. Production is off the charts with beautiful mini's that are different for every family. The rulebook is one of the best that I've ever seen, the overall artwork is excellent, and graphic design is flawless. My only complaint is that they could've used more variety in the illustrations of the job cards. Two thumbs way up!

Yup, I'll have to echo what many others have said.  This game is ok, but will likely be forgotten about in a year.  While the idea of the tin suitcases is commendable, they're too fiddly - if you want to keep track of what's in there, constantly opening, dumping, and sifting gets old fast.  The Godfather theme is basically zero, it could basically be any gangster/criminal theme - not a big deal for me, but those who are expecting a full Godfather immersion will be sorely disappointing.  It boils down to bashing the one you think is ahead, which if people are guessing wrong, hands the win to someone else.  It's ok, as I said, but ok isn't good enough - off to the trade pile.

I was very surprised by how well this game works.  Just like the movie, it is both elegant and violent.  Good thing the Hudson River is big enough to hold all those bodies.

Only played with 3. So far seems quite fun. A combination of money accumulation, set collection, and area control. It all seems thematic (money, duh; sets, are dominating particular illegal enterprises; areas are controlling parts of New York). More tactical than strategic and more chaotic than some folks might like. It has pick on the leader tendencies but because your accumulating points (money) are secret, people may pick on the wrong leader. Skill clearly matters but the chaos might annoy people who prefer a more Euro experience. Whatever. It's a relatively quick game and I don't mind some chaos. Reasonably light, smart non gamers could learn it (and that it plays 5 is a nice bonus).

I wouldn't play with people who are AP prone (heaven help us) or people who insist on tracking all hidden information (sad). 

For those who are Godfather fans, this is not very Godfathery. It has a general mob vibe but the connections to the movie are very superficial.

Finally, if you don't like "take that" mechanisms, this has some of those. They're not super painful (you only lose your dudes that you've already played and only for the turn) but it is there. Then again, if you play a Godfather game you better expect at least a little violence.

This does a decent job of capturing the mafia title in a short playtime. There's room for intrigue and backstabbing as well as a great area control aspect to it, and the cards generate a nice mafia theme to the whole thing. At its core , though, the game is fairly simple and mostly a battle of wits, and doesn't draw me in quite enough to make it a top-tier title.

What a pleasant surprise this game was, I got it on a whim when I typically steer clear of licensed games.  I will say aside from the art and the job names this game doesn't really have much to do with the movie.  It is a good game of area control/worker placement/hand management though.

In this game each player is a mob family trying to get the most money in their personal suitcase (representing laundering money).  You do this by placing your figures on different spaces to shake down businesses for money, jobs, the ability to directly launder money, and illegal goods that fulfill jobs.  At the end of each round you have a hand limit and need to discard everything else, representing tribute to the Don, which is a neat and somewhat thematic mechanic.

Also, the production is awesome.  The game has plastic miniatures and other pieces, metal suitcases, card money, and an insert that (for the most part) holds everything well.

Simple ruleset, short, competitive. Pretty abstract despite the IP. Highly competitive and cutthroat with a lot of take-that. But because of the length and because the swings happen to everyone, it doesn't hurt that bad. Great step-up game beyond the typical gateways.

I really like the combination here of worker placement and area control.  There is a real tension between placing your worker in a spot you want for the action versus the spot you think you should take for area scoring.  Some of the art is really good, and I think the theme is well executed for the most part.  On the other hand, some of the art is really lazy.  I'd be fine with zero minis if there wasn't the same art on every quest card and every item card.  

The reason this game gets a weak rating from me, though, is that the quest cards are pretty terribly designed, even for a 'take that' style game.  Specifically, the cards that allow you to steal money that people have put in their suitcase (end game points) are just a ridiculous design.  If you hit a person with one of those, the next player to fulfill one is likely going to target that same person, because they will have given their garbage cards to the first guy.  They'll have already been wrecked, and you are incentivized to wreck them even harder if you want to score the most that you can.  One guy in our game had a terrible time because of this terribly designed, yet extremely powerful card.  The take-that style mechanics are not really my thing in general, but this has to be one of the worst uses of them that I've seen in a long time.

A very good game. Expensive for what you get tho. I assume most of the money went on the licence (unnecessary as the game would still have been a great generic mob themed game), miniatures (which do look great but could have been cubes) and the tin suitcases that are basically a gimmick. Gameplay however is what this game is all about (who would have thought it?!) and although it does struggle to justify the price of £72 it remains a very solid and enjoyable game.

I think it is on the cusp of being on the wrong side of Time:Enjoyment ratio as it's run long a couple of times (3hrs for 5 players)

Love this game after two plays.  The game really snowballs towards the end.  At first it feels like you can barely accomplish anything.  Then in the last act I have a hand of 15 cards and I'm creating cool job combo's with character placement and ally cards.  Decisions are always tense.  Do you place your character primarily thinking about the  benefit they get or the placement they secure.    

First game was 5 players and lasted almost 3 hours.  I thought it could be due to a slower, AP prone player, but the second game, also 5 players, took almost 3 hours as well.  I'm sure with less players it goes by quicker.  

In the end, really enjoyable game.  I'm not at all bothered by the art as many are.

Corleone's Empire is a serviceable worker placement game, though fans of the genre have plenty of better options to select from. Its conflicts walk in stutter-step rather than flowing naturally, much comes down to your pull of jobs, and without diplomacy or table-talk there's no real sense of loyalty or betrayal. Its most interesting aspects, such as the more impactful jobs or allies, are tragically thin on the ground. And it doesn't help that the game has little to do with The Godfather besides a horse-head token and some act titles.

Too much of lottery for a game that last that long. It has AP for some players but it doesn't matter they spend so much time thinking - it has no real impact since there is too much things that are just random.

If you enjoy area control - there are better games.
If you enjoy 'dudes on a map' - there are better games.
If you want to spend two/three hours and then randomly find out you won - it's the game for you.

[b]A warning:[/b] let people know up front that there are two attack cards to prepare for. One of them makes you discard a card from your hand, and another makes you lose three cards from your suitcase. If people aren't prepared for these cards then it can make for a bad surprise.

I'll also say that the msrp is way too high. The cards feel cheap and they all have the same piece of artwork. This is just some miniatures, cards, five metal tins (each one a little larger than an Altoid pack) and the board.

With that said, the game is great.

"Elegant" usually doesn't get thrown around when it comes to Eric Lang designs, but this is one elegant euro game. There are no tokens all over the place, no fiddly rules, no laborious setup. Just a nicely streamlined game with minimal components. This elegance also makes setup fast and easy. Just hand everybody their minis and set out a few piles of cards and you're ready to start. The rules echo this elegance. After one read through of the rule book you likely won't even need to open it again. I really appreciate such a simple set of rules for a game that feels like it's much more involved.

The gameplay is where the game really shines. You basically have three different levels that you're working with. Where you place your figures is one level, because you get different bonuses and they help you to control different areas. Managing the cards in your hand is another level, and similarly, managing the cards in your suitcase is another.

The card management is the heart of the game. You can only keep so many cards from round to round and there are only so many actions that let you bank your cards, so it's all about prioritizing. You can go out and grab a bunch of cards early, but then if the "bank" actions get taken you'll be stuck with too many cards. On the other hand, you might need to take some bank actions before you have time to upgrade your money.

It's a really smart system. The elegance, ease of play, and simplicity of rules means that this will likely be a keeper.

Card driven area control with a mafia theme and a strong euro structure just sounds awesome. Miniatures might be overproduction, but just look nice. First play left vs right hand and I totally get the hype, this game really lives. Rounds are super tight, you have to be very efficient and calculating, but still the mafia theme carries well. Setup is smart and fast, play turns are quick. Keeper.

I'm very happy with this game. The rules are not overly complicated and this allows you to compete right away. Some games you know before playing that due to complexity you will lose your learning game. Not the case here. Also another plus is that there's some nice player interaction too. I do agree with some complaints that the theme could have been implemented better. Beyond that this game is excellent. I hope that add some type of expansion to it in the future.

Good area-control & worker-placement game with a strong theme. Interesting mechanic with suit-casing money.
It is an euro game, but allows for player interaction (gunning down opponents' figurines, stealing money) which is very much with the theme and a welcome addition to euro-dudes-on-a-map games. It does not have many different paths to victory (like Scythe for ex) but that makes it easier for new players to learn and play the game and quickly catch up.

I have mixed feelings about the components. While the board and figurines are very nice, the cards feel and look cheap and non-imaginative (the same picture on all the jobs).

Worker placement with superficial interaction. Resources are suited cards used to complete jobs(cards) to draw money (cards), which players will place in a briefcase to be counted at the end of game. The most devastating actions are often randomly drawn from the job deck and done without warning, so strategy is a minor consideration. Con: a little boring and uninspired. Pro: it could be played in under an hour if a $70 filler game is your thing.

Black Friday 2017. I bought this because it became so cheap I couldn't ignore it. I'm a huge Godfather fan, but I didn't think the game was interesting enough to buy it full price. After a play, I must admit that it's quite decent though, and I'm looking forward to playing it again. Quite light, but also rather confrontational which I like.

This game is CUTTHROAT.  The theme is definitely present in this game, and does make the game so much better.  I love that this game is so tactical, and is not just a straight up conflict.  deciding which orders to carry out, and when to add to your suitcase make the game so interesting.  Honestly this game is one of my favorites, and I loved the Godfather IP before this game came out so now its just fantastic.  I am sure the more I play this the more I am going to love this game.

At its heart this is basically another worker placement/area control game. What sets it apart especially for the boomer crowd is the theme. If you want to immerse yourself in the theme of what has become an iconic movie for my generation, this is the game to do it with.

Another great game from Eric Lang - a lovely mix of area majority and worker placement. It's not his best design, but it's still very solid and, most importantly, fun to play. I really like the grim, noir  theme (it's not super strong, but it gives just the right amount of flavour to players' actions). The Godfather reminds me of Lords of Waterdeep - if you like the latter you should also like this one. They both share similar feel and both have equal level of negative interaction. Highly recommended, definitely give it a try.

The only downside is the fact that most of the cards share the same boring image, I think that it's unacceptable for this price...

Confrontational "thugs on a map" worker placement, set collection and area influence.  Doin' jobs of murder and intrigue to include car bombs and espionage that pack quite a punitive take-that element against the other mafia families. First player is a dead horse of course.

After one play, I had a good time with this one. We did play with five players, and there was a bit of rules clarification needed here and there, but everyone seemed to have a good time. A bit long at that player count, but it likely would speed up with fewer people -- or more experienced players.

I enjoyed the thematic linkages in the gameplay (getting muscled out of turf, socking away money, calling in city allies, etc), and the decisions and machinations get more devious as the game progresses.

Some folks won't like the take that stuff (car bombs, drive-bys), but I'd say it balances out, as everyone can do it... or something similar. And the area control aspect means no one person would likely pick on just one other (or not for long).

I liked the suitcasing of money and the bidding on allies, as that added some tension to certain rounds. Some of the worker placement moments caused a few players to agonize over decisions longer than they should, but I suspect that too would improve in subsequent plays.

Overall, I enjoyed it.

RATING: 8.5
This is a fun game. Area control/Euro game with auction and backstabbing elements. It is a mob game, so expect confrontation. There is a great deal of strategy, planning, and careful maneuvering on the board (which creates some table politics mafia style), involved in this game.

There is much to consider on your turn. There are many layers of depth on what to do especially as the game moves into later acts. Do you shake down a business through the front door, or fight for area control and do a backdoor action? Complete a job to Conserve the placement of your henchmen to take actions later? How much do you suitcase and what denominations (if you can)? What cards do you keep and what cards do you turn over to the Godfather after each act?

Conflict is assured. It is not for the passive aggressive types that cannot handle confrontation. Be warned if you are playing with people who take things personally.

I understand the complaint about the theme. It is not actually about the Godfather. The game would have been better titled Mob Boss, Mob Wars, or my favorite title Murder Inc. These titles describe the game better. So if you are looking for the Godfather movie here, you won't really find it. CMON should have not paid the royalties to use the name of the Godfather. The titles I give above more aptly describe the game. Nonetheless, in my opinion, the disconnect between the title and what goes on in the game does not take away from the game itself. It is definitely a gangster game, and did I say it is fun?

It has a lot of potential for expansions. This maybe a criticism too, because there are stereotypical mob activities that are not considered in this game. As a result, I see room for an expansion to this game (such as new business tiles to shake down, creating new types of job cards, a side map representing control over the U.S. (Chicago, Las Vegas etc. - or solely a side map of Las Vegas), or creating the ability for a player to call a mob meeting (by completing three types of jobs?), like the 1957 Appalachian meeting with some gambling mechanic whereby everyone draws a cue ball to simulate a FBI raid leading to the player who picked the blackball to lose a henchman, but then turn evidence against other players and screw them somehow too, but not as bad - maybe lose money from the suitcase for lawyer fees), One other criticism that I might see is that the game is missing some type of alliance system or some kind of fealty action which then makes betrayal so painful and desirous of revenge as seen in many mob stories. In this game your other players are always your enemies - so there are no real alliances except for unspoken alliances to slow down the perceived leader. How about murdering someone in your own gang to get something in return - does this not happen on a common basis within Mob families? Finally, there are no dice in this game, so in my opinion making it a little more Ameritrashy would not hurt it at all. It is the kind of game that should be a hybrid Eurotrashy or Ameruro...

For these two aforementioned reasons it does not push to a 9 or 10 (I debated the  8 I gave it against giving it a 7.9 or 7.8 but this is of little difference and I do enjoy the game for what it is).

This is a game I will not turn down. I love cut-throat games. I have played so many games in my life that it is no sweat off my back if I loose or if someone screws me - I am trying to win just like them, so it is all part of the game (I am tired of patty-cakes players anyway - people play to win, they do not play to lose. There is always going to be a winner and thus confrontation in a game.  So, what is the point of playing a game if  you cannot play a game without having your feelings hurt? You need to grow up! But this is my view of the world these days and so if you have read this far, forgive me - I digress). Some might call the game mean, I call it fun. If you can get over the issue of the title/theme, and like the mechanics then this game might be for you.

To note: After several plays we have had some discussion about balance. Going the gangster route and using the grey cards which requires weapons does not seem to be way to victory. Maybe using the grey cards once or twice can be useful, if your opponents have used up their figures. But laying a car bomb in an area you want to control while your opponents still have figures is not a good idea. Picking up a grey card off of the public job deck makes no sense early in the round. Also there is only one liquor area. There is also one liquor tile that may or may not come out. While you may get narcotics tiles which are wild, it does seem that getting liquor in the upper east side is very important especially if you need it for yellow or green cards. Maybe you can finish a grey job to complete a yellow or green job. Blood money is the easiest to acquire. Guns are limited like liquor. This factor affects strategy. I am ignoring weapons cards unless I am forced into it, or it is easy to complete. One game as the tiles came out, I had a great fourth round. I did a muscle in, to a shake down, which gave me so many cards that I was able to do an extortion and a car bomb. 

This game is popular with my group and is a keeper. It is certainly in my top 10 for 2017.

Played a few rounds at the UK Games Expo. I thought the game was pretty straight forward to understand and play.  But I had some small concerns; the game seems light and the decisions did not seem that tough.    Simply put dudes on circles or squares or buildings to perform actions and you almost always want to go on circles as they pay out better.

I am not sure if the game I played was final or not, there was 1 issue that kept bugging me.  The manual and box art looked really good, but the board and card art looked liked it was done by somebody else, the weapon, bottle cards in particular looked like clip art but the manual art looked really nice.

I am not convinced its a game I will buy, and will wait for competitive prices when it finally gets released later this year.

--- 

Played in full, once with 4 players; the game is okay, a worker placement game similar to Lords of Waterdeep and can be a bit of take-that; I like the on-going benefits gained from area control.   

Pros: Light/middleweight worker placement game;  quick actions and gameplay.

Cons:  Very high price point, the game doesn't seem that heavy, there is no real in-game, movie connection.  Feels a bit like a pasted on theme at times.

Overall: 6/10

Érdekes élmény volt. Gyorsan leszögezném, h alapvetően nagyon jól éreztem magam, jó a játék hangulata. DE. A tematika picit kevés, jó indulattal is csak közepes, szerintem jó pár ziccer kimaradt. Eseménykártyákat pl. tettem volna bele, igaz, ezzel dőlt volna a balansz... Egy játék után persze nehéz erről beszélni, de a 3 fős meccs végére nálunk 71-71-71 pont született, ami mókás volt, de hosszútávon ez nem tudom mennyire jó. Ennek oka a kevés küldetéskártya lehet, pár fajta van csak belőle, pedig jó lett volna ezt egy kicsit megbolondítani (akár az ennyire precíz kiegyensúlyozottság rovására is). A játék közepesen hosszú, de annyira nem mély, nehéz az elejétől egy jól felépített stratégiát végigvinni, itt is volt egy kis hiányérzetem. És még egy DE. Ennek ellenére hatalmas móka, a téma ellenére is végigröhögtük (inkább szórakoztatóan, nem infantilis módra) az egészet, kifejezetten jó volt vele játszani. Bármikor leülök vele még egy körre - a világot nem váltja meg, nagyon korrekt iparosmunka, egyfajta casual CitOW.

I like it, played it at the game table and the group enjoyed it. It is a smooth and strategic style of play, good mobster theme. The Godfather theme is loose but I think it captures the feel of the genre and movie. Takes place during movie 1, acts named after major arcs in the film, but has that upcoming feel of the DeNiro scenes in Godfather II, the rise to power feel that for me really locks that theme in place. Like the families and figures, enjoy the game, much fun, and am willing to bet that there with be an expansion that possibly delves a little deeper into the theme of The Godfather.

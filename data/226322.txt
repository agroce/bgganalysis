The question is why I keep buying crappy smaller Vlaada Chvátil games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The game itself is cute and would be a fantastic early dating game but the cards are too few thus repetitive. After only two games, I've seen half a dozen duplicate plays. That's definitely part of luck, but in two games, one with three players and one with five, that's obviously quite pathetic odds. 

If they came out with expansions at an affordable rate, I can see this game being a team building exercise used in workplaces of everykind, dating games as mentioned above and definitely party/filler games.  

Setup is virtually instant. Scoring as simple as counting to three. Breakdown just as fast. There's nothing else to say as there's not much to it.

Certainly not Vlaada Chivatl's best game, but still a fairly good one.  It definitely plays best with a group of people who know each other so you can ask difficult questions based on what you know about each player.  

Also, I found that the game was more fun when you would ask clarifying questions on the rationale behind their decision or have the person who answered just give a reason why on the logic.  It then acts as a way for people to get to socialize and get to know each other through a board game.  Unlike most of Vlaada's games where you just optimize for points or try to find the best action, this game lets you get to know your friends a bit more!

Another party game from Vlaada and it isn't terrible. It's sort of a "Would you rather" style game that is okay as a party game and does include some mildly interesting scoring pieces. In the end, though, it's not very exciting and feels similar to other "done to death" party games.

I've been looking for a good answer these questions honestly and the rest of us try to figure it out. All the other ones I know either don't work well as games (think Scruples) or result in hurt feelings (think Imaginiff or True Colours). This solves both of those problems.

My only concern is the limitation regarding the number of cards in the game. Hopefully, the game will be popular enough with others to warrant an expansion that, say, triples the number of cards possible.

RATING: 6
Basically a guided game of "would you rather?" - I enjoyed playing with my friends but it's not as fresh as Vlaada's other ideas.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
My first game was with just 3 players, which I feel is not enough to really enjoy it.  It's a bit stiff with just 3 asking questions in a circle.  We did have a few laughs however, so this is high on my list to give another shot to soon.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Cute premise. Only one playthrough so far, but was often left with a hand of cards where it felt like the only 2 cards I could pick to make a question for someone were fairly lopsided and/or boring questions.

A very good party game. Shouldn't be played with strangers or people you've just met and have no plans to see again. You have to care a bit about what the other players' opinions are about things to make it a great party game.

Party game that is very group dependent. Demoed at Origins 2017.

RATING: 2
Its just not very fun!

Questions are not particularly interesting and oft times feel very forced, and this is further limited by the 5 tiles you have in hand forcing a comparison essentially between apples and oranges, or even worse between apples and aardvarks... questions so absurd as to make the game ridiculous.

I am all for getting to know people and the social side of gaming, but honestly I couldn't care less what you think about if the colour pink suddenly ceased to exist! :surprise: 

Skip this game and just have a conversation

Average party game, somewhat dissappointing after the superb party games Codenames and Pictomania.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Not as elegant as Codenames, which is maybe disappointing but not surprising. But it's a party game where people playing for points and people who just want an icebreaker or conversation starter will, unusually, find their interests aligned-- folks who are out for blood are rewarded for asking interesting questions. Which is to say, as a question-asker there's no such thing as playing it safe. I find that super interesting.

RATING: 7
Excellent social party game. Great convo starters. Works well with groups that know a bit about one another and just as well with groups that may not know each other too well (work colleagues, or icebreaker-type introductions). This is due to the two types of modifiers you can use to score more points: one chip will triple your score if you predict a correct answer, the other will score you points for every wrong answer. The lively discussions surrounding the choices each player makes when questioned are the glue that holds this game together. And questions are never TMI-embarrassing. Lots of variable replay value due to the construction of the cards, which provide one-half of three different either/or questions.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (December 2017)
 
Vlaada Chvátil is, by far, my favorite game designer, I will buy anything from him and, after Codenames, I was very keen to try his next party game. After playing it, I can say I will (most likely) keep it and I liked it, but I was expecting something a bit better.
 
The rules of the game are fun to read and easy to learn and teach. You can teach them under 2 minutes. Playtime is around 60 minutes with 6 players (Due to this I think I prefer to play with 4 players). The game should last around 30-45 minutes to remain fun.
 
The game´s components are ok although I dislike the hexagonal shape of the cards as it makes it harder to sleeve (I still sleeved them). The art of the game is cute, the graphic design of the board is nice, but sometimes, players went backward instead of advance their squirrels, so there must be an issue there. I really like the cover of the game.
 
The game is fun for me, in each round all players play (no downtime) as there is one player who is asked a question and the others try to guess his answer, it has a Dixit feel and I like it. The questions are interesting but I feel there are too few of them, that is, I’m not sure if the game has the legs to withstand a lot of plays, time will tell.

Vlaada always presents innovative  mechanism in his games, but this time around he didn’t, still, the game delivers and I will keep it in my game collection for now. In this category of games, I still like more Imaginiff.

Bottom line, That's a Question! is a fun party game and my desire to play it again is high. I was expecting a wider reception from players but I have heard next to nothing about this game, which is very weird for a Vlaada game. You need the correct group to play That's a Question!, you need people who explain the rationale of their answers, otherwise, the game would be very boring.

Normally I’m a big fan of games from the hand of Vlaada! This one felt odd and didn’t flow really, the tokens deciding who you could ask drove us nuts. It’s a question if it was explained well to us during the demo. We already felt the need to houserule the point system after 15 minutes.

Seemingly, every single part of this game has been purposely crafted in a way that makes it nearly unusable. The board is too small with a winding scoring track, to make sure you may accidentally move your cute but fiddly squirrel-pawns in the wrong direction. The cards are roughly round with text oriented in three ways, to make it more fun to constantly move them around while trying to figure out which of them to attach to the similarly misshaped question board. Unfortunately, most of the time your choices are not really interesting, so you might as well pick cards at random. The rule book hides the actual rules between the usual "funny" flavour text, tells you that you only need to read the highlighted parts to play the game, and that the rest is pure fluff and then includes fluff in the highlighted sections and includes rules in the fluff sections. Hm. I am a bit infuriated by this game. And I almost did not get started on the convoluted rules set obfuscating a somewhat interesting if standard fare game. And I wont. A thoroughly unsatisfying game. Even though it has nuts and squirrels. Really like the nuts.

Ugh. Is this actually a game? What would you rather do: play this or be beaten to death with your own testicles? Answer: I don't know.

It almost...almost...gets a bonus point for squirrel meeples. Squirreeples? Squirples? Squeeples? Thinking of those was more fun by a thousand percent than than playing the game.

Reasonable party game of the "get to know you" or "how well do I know you?" variety. Tame and doesn't outstay its welcome (though no one calls for a repeat play). Probably worth houseruling it so you can mismatch the colors.

Needlessly complex rules for a reskin of a game type that has been made many times before.  Not every simple game concept needs gamer rules added in.

I prefer the basic simplicity of Choose One.  If I want to up the game play, I could go to Say Anything or What's It To Ya? (2006 version)

RATING: 6
Another Vlaada party game? This one really requires getting either 5 or 6 players to play this. It's just not fun at low player counts. Each player has a hand of cards that have 3 sides to them. When it's your turn you ask another player one of the 3 possible scenarios and use cards from your hand to flesh it out. So for example one of the questions is "Which do you find worse?" and the cards in your hand have something like "People who don't clean up their dogs poo" or "Someone who leaves the chips open".

It was somewhat enjoyable and I'd play it again, but I'm not as impressed with this as I was with Codenames.

Nettes "Partyspiel", dass ich allerdings erst ab 5 Personen empfehlen würde.
Bisher habe ich es 1x zu dritt und 1x zu fünft gespielt.
Zu dritt war es doch eher mäßig
(eigentlich logisch, wenn einer rät, einer antwortet und folglich nur einer tippt).
Zu fünft hat es richtig Spaß gemacht

That's a Question! is basically a time-honored parlor game with added woodland creatures and some kicker tokens to add a splash of drama. Which is to say, don't go in expecting anything more than a minor entry in Chvátil's catalog and you just might have some fun.

Played the game at Origins 2017. Mechanically the game is sound but I was bored playing it. Also, there are already many games that exist that provide the exact same experience of betting on what your friends think. Normally Vlaada makes very original games, but for this one it seems he really phoned it in.

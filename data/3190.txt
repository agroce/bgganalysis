I like all of the wooden Gigamic games, just because they look so cool. This one is light and interesting. But it seems like it can drag a little as the players keep blocking each other. Hard to develop a way to win. When we've played it seems like you just get lucky and happen to get in a good situation. But then again, I've never lost, so maybe I'm doing something right.

It really doesn't grab me. The number of possibilities at each branch is huge, which makes analysis very difficult. It seems to be pretty clearly oriented towards mobility, though I admit that my analysis could be off.

Tic-Tac-Toe the sequel.  Well, that's basically how I think of it.  It's a simply enough abstract game, if you're playing X's when your goal is to get 5 X's in a row (orthogonally or diagonally).  This is very quick and much more enjoyable than Tic Tac Toe.  It's not a great game, but I'm not opposed to playing it every now and again when requested.

Played a number of times at Essen 2012 whilst waiting for other members of group to turn up.  Nice production values.  Gameplay is fun - if played in that reasonably quick frame of mind.

RATING: 3
Quixo falls into the "unfortunate abstract" category for me. The game seems to stall pretty early, producing multiple moments in which you don't want to do anything for fear of it being more productive to your opponent. However, the "stall" moves don't necessarily make the game move ahead either like they would in a game like Medina (i.e., where the game inevitably moves towards its conclusion).

However, as a Gigamic game, it's still a pretty sight to see (albeit not the prettiest).

Quixo is essentially a more advanced version of Tic-Tac-Toe, but adds the same in-flux dimensional flair found in games like Labyrinth. Baiting your opponent into making a mistake is the best way to win.

RATING: 7.5
This is a variant on Tic-tac-toe but don't let that put you off. The aim of the game is 5-in-a-row this time but the ability to take a cube and slide it from one edge means that the playing area is constantly evolving and this provides the challenge. 

Much more fun than it should be and can be learned in under 60 seconds. Great game for the gamer and non-gamer alike.

RATING: 5
An abstract of trying to get 5 in a row in a 5 by 5 grid of cubes. The cubes all start on the blank side and each turn you pick up a cube, turn it to your side if it isn't already (be it noughts or crosses), bring it to one edge of the grid and then push it back into the row it vacated, moving all the cubes along. Like the usual in this genre, it's about creating double threats and being alert to your opponent's plans to do the same. The game is simple enough, easy rules, but it doesn't create any need to explore, maybe because it just feels too easy to push things around and dissolve threats. Eventually there'll be too many pieces flipped for someone to fight off the inevitable, but then you'll be done with the game, probably feeling the same thematic ennui that Tic Tac Toe provides. On the positive, it's all over in 5 to 10 minutes so if you dig it you can re-set and go again. 2 player filler only though for mine.

tic-tac-toe on steroids...um...mild steroids.  Abstract game that is okay but i don't seem to have the patience for.  Nice wood pieces though.  one of the drawback of this game that we have encountered it that you can get in to stalemate kind of conditions were you aren't reversing opponents moves but there are a serious of moves that kind of just put the board in the same situation so one player end up having break this tread which can end in defeat anyway.

RATING: 6
Enjoyable short game to get 5 in a row, and very fast to learn the rules. It's sufficiently interesting that we played 8 times in a row the first time, but it doesn't seem as interesting or unique as some other Gigamic games, e.g. lacking the 3-dimensionality of Pylos and Inside.

I did notice that our early games ended quickly, with plenty of blank cubes still in play, then we got better and entered a sort of next phase of play with all the blank cubes gone, or only in the interior, and the feel of the game shifts then. That was cool.

But it feels like just waiting for the opponent to make a blunder. Maybe my rating will change with more plays and experience and insight.

Perfect travel game. Could be played on a train or canal barge or in the back of a caravan/tent; in fact anywhere you choose. It's a damn sight more portable, and easier to play in the pub, than Arkham Horror. Haha!

This reminds me of one of those sliding puzzles that you used to play when you where 10, with the complexity of play dial turned up a few notches.
Plays like a dream. Everyone I've introduced this to has liked it. I have a soft spot - hidden under crushed velvet - for quick abstracts, and this gem ticks all the boxes. Simple choices enable players to play swiftly, but the ramification of those choices can be devastating. It does pay to plan a few turns ahead. Games like this keep you on your toes and make your brain shift up a gear; never a bad thing.

I haven't formed my own cohesive strategm as yet. With more plays my rating for this could rise by a point or two.

Looks nice and interesting at first, but once you realize the game never ends, unless the other player makes a stupid mistake, this game is no longer worth playing.

RANK: 275

RATING: 5
Fun game, but runs too long for what it is. Unless you play the short version (start on 7 influence) but then this invalidates a lot of the negotiation in the Intrigue phase, because you'll rarely need someone else's help to play cards. Still a good game but these days there are too many other games I'd much rather be playing in the allotted time.

I really like this game. One of those few licensed properties that actually turned out to be good (based on the first and best season of the show). Unfortunately, I can't convince my wife to get past the theme to play it. :p

Le pongo esta nota por lo divertido que resulta, y lo bien adaptado que está de la serie. Tras pocas partidas, puedo decir que es un "pierde amigos" muy divertido, con cartas muy exageradas, siendo bastante simple en sus mecánicas tradicionales de comercio, subasta simultánea, traición y lucha con dados simples. Lo peor es ésta lucha que se puede alargar, hacer muy repetitiva y con poca profundidad, y también como crítica, la traducción del manual, que me ha llevado a crear un resumen de ronda detallada - Resumen de reglas que podéis descargar aquí:

This is the most requested game I own. I have never had anything but a great night with this with many laughs and shocked gasps throughout.

Spartacus is a heavy dice rolling game. Nearly everything is decided with dice, whereas at the same time there is a heavy meta game involved with bribing and blackmailing other players. Spartcaus has 3 different gameoptions where you can decide to play a fast, medium or long game, which is nice. The bidding mechanism in Spartacus is good.

Pretty fun. The dice rolling mechanic is pretty unique. It's pretty long though (lots of phases). Lots of treachery and tough decisions. You do get to feel like you're jockeying for position. Very thematic. Only gripe is that it's a bit long.

Never quite hit for me, I liked the idea of it but it was too much random cardplay. The game that proved I really am down the eurogame end of the spectrum and this is way too ameritrash for me.

Great game of strategy and intrigue and the best part is the time it takes to play sees it constantly played. Limiting factor is the luck of the dice and card draws, also the game hinges fun wise on people that like to negotiate or roleplay. But overall a great game with lots of laughs and thought.

Well, what I have to say about this game is that it is very good, there is a very good design here, the arena battles are very interesting and there are some interesting strategies to win a battle in the arena and others to win the influence. There is a bash the leader, but not as agressive as Munchkin or other games that has the bash the leader thing.

I really enjoy playing this game because of how fun it is but also because it helped me get a lot of my non board gamer friends interested in board gaming. I really like how it generates so much player interaction to go along with tons of strategy. My only complain is that the house special abilities aren't balanced in my opinion.

Excuse to use my set of painted gladiator figures, game of blood and treachery s very apt! Game to end all games in my view just because it does not encourage anything  remotely like decency, it's a game of backstab, bluff, deceit, brutality, lust, violent combat, I play it on a poker table and with my figures - you can smell the blood and gore and feel the sweat - best card name of all time "Jupiter's Cock" !

Excellent Ameritrash game for the blood thirsty.  Not sure there is much strategy in this. By design, I think this will always be a tight game.

Plays a little longer than I'd like, but was fun the whole way through.

Divertido para jugar ocasionalmente.
Subastas, traiciones y luchas de gladiadores.
Tiende a ser repetitivo ya que hay poca variedad de cartas. Los combates son pura suerte y hay poca estrategia en general en todo el juego. Aún así, si los jugadores se implican, da lugar a momentos graciosos.
Buen precio y en general un juego aceptable sin alardes.
Dosificarlo porque hay riesgo de quemarlo.
Jugar al escenario intermedio (influencia 4) ya que el extendido se hace bastante largo y pesado.

There is really nothing about this game I dislike. The Intrigue, the back stabbing, front stabbing, Schemes and Foils, the simple Auction mechanics, the arena wagers, and the dice chains used in combat, all of which feel intuitive and are easy to teach. This is a HIGHLY confrontational game, in more phases than just the arena combat, and it so perfectly captures the scandalous, barbaric nature of the show that is is probably Gale Force Nine's best TV adaptation to the tabletop. Just awesome. Check your friendships at the door.

I'm glad I played, but don't really have any desire to play again. Mainly as the theme isn't of interest.
I won the game I played after taking part in only two fights, losing the first (by decapitation?) and winning the final fight after a three way tie had two of my opponents fight each other first.

Going to need to see a game with 4 players before I make a real judgement... but seems like it's a pretty solid "reel in the leader" with a fun arena mechanic at the end of every turn. Lots of bidding and card draws, and pretty decent uneven powers.

The Intrigue phase feels very lacking (draw your hand, dump it on the leader, and then sell off everything else), and the arena phase needs a pretty heavy modification to make the game playable.

This game started out as something I couldn't play enough of, but I burnt out on it in a major way.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A deceptively simple game that is just built to make brilliant stories. I'm yet to see a game that makes such a strong emotional connection with the players, yet can be so easy to pick up. I've also never played it with any less than 4 starting influence, as the game begins to lose steam at 3 hours, and it's better it ends with a bang than limps to a finish. Lots of flaws, but they're easy to overlook when a game is this impactful, entertaining and cheap.

A relatively low purchase price and a TV tie-in meant I really was not anticipating great things from this game. In reality this has proven to be a blast from start to finish. The theme works brilliantly, the components are very good and the whole game has the feel of something that has been well developed. My only reservation is the length of the game, but this is a very minor gripe given how much fun it is to play and certainly does not out stay its welcome on the table top. Along with Firefly in their stable Gale Force Nine are establishing a real knack for creating excellent TV/Game cross-over stuff and there is  more to follow.

A sorozatot hárman is végignéztük a családból, és egységesen nagyon szerettük! Nem is értem, miért vártam eddig a beszerzéssel. Szerintem aki hasonlóan szerette a sorozatot, az mindenképp próbálja ki. A játék erőssége a tematikája. Nekünk nagyon átjött a film hangulata, főleg a szereplők miatt, de az intrika kártyák közt is sok visszaköszön a sorozatban (pl. Jupiter pöcse...).
Előrebocsátom, hogy mi csak kieggel együtt próbáltuk, sőt házilag legyártottuk még az 5 promo gladiátort is, és azt is belekevertük (remélem majd sikerül beszerezni ezeket eredetiben is). Így nagyon nagy a variancia. Egyelőre csak 2 rövid változaton vagyunk túl, az elnevezés helytálló, mert akár 1 óra alatt lemehet 3 fővel (6-an nyilván sokkal hosszabb). Sajnos ez csak arra volt jó, hogy kicsit belekóstoljunk, de így nem nagyon lehet kibontakozni, ez a változat csak arra való szerintem, hogy ha időhiány van, vagy új embernek mutatjuk meg a játékot, akkor ez is elég... De így pl. champion jelzőt nem szerzett senki, nem nagyon tudtunk felfuttatni egy gladiátort sem, és néhány háztulajdonság és általában a támogatások fontossága sem jött ki így, mert szinte minden intrika kártyát gond nélkül ki tudunk játszani (az intrikáknak csak kb. 10%-a igényel 7-nél nagyobb befolyást, és ugye ebben a változatban 7-ről kezd mindenki). Ráadásul a kieggel együtt már nagyon nagy a piac és az intrika pakli is, ilyen rövid partiban csak töredékével találkozunk a lapoknak. A gladiátorok közül csak  néhány nagyágyú bukkant fel.
Előzetesen féltünk tőle, hogy túl szemétkedős lesz a játék, de így utólag nem volt zavaró. Tetszik, hogy mindenre lehet valami válasza a többieknek, nincs tuti recept semmilyen helyzetben. Jó a házigazda szerep, de vannak kockázatai is. Az aréna fázis tetszik: egzakt a harc mechanizmusa, és valósághűek az erőviszonyok: a 4-4-4-es Spartacus letarol egy 3-3-2-es gyengébb gladiátort, de azért a felszerelések nagyon bekavarhatnak! A speciális képességek pedig kifejezetten feldobják a csatákat, ezzel oldják meg, hogy nincs két egyforma képességű harcos. Az intrika kártyák egyszerűen csak változatosak, a gladiátor és rabszolgakártyák viszont nemcsak színessé hanem tematikussá is teszik a játékot. Spartacus és Gannicus a támadásban jó, Ashur átállhat az ellenséghez, Varro aranyat kap mások sérülése után, stb. 
A fogadások is ügyes ötlet, és a végén az élet-halál döntés is. Tetszik, hogy mezei rabszolgát is beküldhetünk az arénába, ezzel is lehet taktikázni:)
Kérdés, mennyire lehet gyorsan lefutott a játék. Jellegéből adódóan nehezen tudom elhinni, hogy gyorsan eldőljön, mivel mindenkitől lehet befolyást elvenni, mindenkivel minden helyzetben ki lehet babrálni. Előnyt lehet kovácsolni akár saját harcosunk halálából is, ha megfelelő kártyánk van, és hátrányt lehet szenvedni a legígéretesebb helyzetekben is. Ha valakinek szuper harcosai vannak, de nincs elég sok pénze, egyáltalán nem biztos, hogy bele tud szólni a viadalok rendezésébe, így lehet hogy nem kap meghívást, és nem tudja pénzre/pontra váltani gladiátorai képességeit. Ha teljesül az, hogy mindig a legerősebbet ütik a többiek, akkor nagyon izgalmas lehet szerintem, bárki felállhat veszett helyzetből is.
Még egy dolog jutott eszembe: karakterfejlődés nincs a játékban (csak felszerelést lehet a szereplőknek adni és a hírnevük nőhet, amivel változik a helyzetük), de nekem nem is hiányzik, mivel ismert személyek ismert erőviszonyait kellett szimulálni. Ezeket az erőviszonyokat készen kapjuk.
Jól kitalált játék, nem egy ócska bőrlehúzás, hanem tényleg élvezhető, bár szerintem leginkább a sorozatot kedvelőknek. A szabály nagyon egyszerű, amit igazán a sokféle kártya tölt meg tartalommal. Simán adhatnának még ki kieget, bár nem tudom találnak-e egy kiegre való szereplőt, már így is 40+ gladiátor és majdnem 40 rabszolga van, ha nem is mindenki konkrét személy, néhányan csak egy általános tulajdonsággal vagy szakmával vannak jelölve (szakács, elítélt...), de legalább 50 konkrét szerepelő így is van. A 6 ház is elég változatos (alap 4, kieg 2), és jók a spec képességeik. Olvastam valahol, hogy az egyik ház túl erős, mi még próbálgatjuk, nem tudjuk, mi az erősorrend.
Ha kipróbáljuk a hosszabb játékmódokat, majd még írok szerintem pár sort, most még nagyon az elején vagyunk a kísérletezgetésnek.
---
Kipróbáltuk a hosszú változatot, ez 3 fővel tisztán majdnem 3 óra volt. Teljesen más az elején a játék dinamikája: nem játszható ki az intrikák többsége, ami a rövid változatnál semmi kihívást nem jelent. Ezenkívül szűk a kézlimit is, primuszra nincs esély az elején... Még azt se mondom, hogy így jobban ki lehet bontakozni, mert a végén nem volt több rabszolgánk, gladiátorunk így sem. A bajnoki jelzőre viszont csak így érzek esélyt, a rövidben nem nagyon. A játék végén ha egy kis szerencsém van, akkor 4(!) pontot tudtam volna szerezni az intrika fázisban, így hogy nem volt szerencsém, csak 3-at. Ez azért nagyon sok ahhoz képest, hogy egy nagy primusz-győzelemért is csak 1 pont jár. Többen valószínűleg nehezebb sok pontot szerezni egy körben, mivel több reakciókártya van kint a kezekben.
3 parti alapján úgy érzem, az egész játék arra van kihegyezve, mikor jönnek a nagyágyúk. Kb. 15 olyan gladiátor van, akik megfelelő felszereléssel bárkit megverhetnek, értük nagyon nagy küzdelem megy, és mindig nagy örömködés van, ha valaki megszerez egyet. De ők is meghalhatnak, nálunk pl. Magnetius lett lefejezve.
Nálunk most az a nagy kérdés, hogy 2 rövid vagy 1 hosszú parti inkább, de legközelebb még kipróbáljuk a közepeset is, hátha az lesz a nyerő:)
---
Kipróbáltuk a közepest is. Nos lehet, hogy nekünk tényleg ez lesz a nyerő, mert nem nyúlik el annyira, és az elején is lehet már cselszövéseket kijátszani. De ha valakinek sok ideje van, annak ajánlom a hosszút, mert abban jobban ki lehet bontakozni. Mi házi szabályként kipróbáltuk azt, hogy 3 főnél 6 lapot csapunk fel a piacon, így kicsit jobban pörög a dolog. Nekünk az a tapasztalat, hogy hárman a rövid 1-másfél óra, a közepes 2, a hosszú meg szűk 3 óra. Tegnap megvolt az eddigi legjobb csata, egy primusz, amit az esélytelenebbek (Dolor+Segovax) nyertek (Spartacus és Zephyros ellen). És rövid partiban sikerült bajnokot avatni!
---
Majdnem megtörtént a csoda: ha egyik őrdobás nem sikertelen, akkor 20 perc alatt véget ért volna egy rövid játék... majdnem annyi az előkészület:) Azért alapvetően mégiscsak jobb egy hosszabb parti. Tervezzük, hogy egyszer majd játszunk egy 20 pontosat, hogy jobban ki tudjunk bontakozni. Amikor valaki eléri a 8-9 pontot, már ott lebeg a befejezés lehetősége (ezért érezzük néha túl rövidnek a 7 pontos kezdést), ami persze lehet hogy csak 1 óra múlva lesz meg, de akár pár perc alatt bekövetkezhet. 6 személyesnél persze más lenne a helyzet, de az ülésrend akkor is sokat számít, van akire már nem lehet reagálni.
Csak hogy a kártyák változatosságára is utaljak: mi minden kieget plusz promót használunk (a 6. partit már a gyári promókkal tudtuk játszani). Van olyan Gladiátor, amelyikkel az eddigi 7 parti alatt még nem találkoztunk. Illetve van olyan, aki már került ugyan hozzánk, de az arénába még nem jutott be (Gannicus pl.). Részben ezért is lenne jó egy extra hosszú parti.

Spartacus is quite surprising: it has everything for being a game I despise, but I somehow enjoyed the fun ride of playing it!
It has open negotiation, a lot of take that and bucket loads of dice rolling... and it is very very long for what it is!
On the other hand, it can truly bring to the table the very spirit of the TV show: treachery, dirty tricks and entertaining fights! The three hours of our first game passed very quickly among laughter and fun... For 35 euros it is a great bargain!
Overall, the rating after one play is a solid 6, and from me for this type of game, it means a lot...

First Impression: I've never watched the tv series but this game is alot of fun in its own right. I would describe the game as sim-gladiator. You run a gladiator house and need to worry about acquiring gladiators, arming them, hoping they survive in the arena, forging alliances with other players, and defending yourself from backstabs. The rules are light and I find the game is really all about the diplomacy. I don't particularly enjoy that arena fights are mostly static.

RATING: 4
What at first seems to be a nice melding of Euro and Ameritrash with some negotiation soon reveals itself as a lot of hot air.  Boring, repetitive and way too long.  The combat is crap, and the game comes down to one player winning because everyone has run out of take that cards to play.

Maybe start at 4 influence and end at 10 or 12?  Keep that in mind for a shorter game...

Blue Dice Variant:
During the initiative roll, players roll all their blue dice, but instead of summing them, the players compare their highest die. Highest wins initiative. If tied, they compare the next highest die and so on.

Don't let players show cards to each other while soliciting for Influence.

Don't play with Seppius or...

When playing with Seppius, there is a before and after Solicitation of Influence whenever he uses his Meddling effect (i.e. a firm acknowledgement of whether Influence will or will not be given.)

Got this during a B&N clearance sale for $5. Turned in to probably the best value for a game I've ever gotten. The game features auction, dice-rolling, miniature combat, and cards. Lots of elements make for different paths to victory and lots of hostile player interactions.

Extremely take-that heavy game of gladiating. The board is pretty, but pretty much surplus to requirement as the combat requires very little manoeuvring, so the game boils down (as many take that type games do) to not looking like the leader until you can take a chance to break for the victory line. Fun none-the-less.

RATING: 6
Spartacus really feels like it’s been made of two games melted into one: here you have the card game and there you have the miniature combat game too. In the middle ground, you have to make do with a decent game that doesn’t shine in either genre but is way too long for what it is.

On my side, it also pays dearly in appeal because of its theme: I really love classical antiquity and seeing how this game (and the show it’s been inspired by) handles Roman history - turned into a fantasy mishmash - really makes my heart bleed.

We played it two player on our first go...  Supposed to be minimum 3.  I really liked it anyways and expect it'll go off with 3 or more players!!

Second Go was with 3 players and it was much more fun!  Hard as hell to keep all your feet on the ground and get ahead!

Its a very good game is you're into "Take That" but I played a 6 player and it was toooo looong

RATING: 9
An extremely engaging game of negotiation.  Backstabbing optional, but easy to incorporate.  Lots of player interaction. It comes down to wisely spending your money, making the most of your secret bidding, and playing to the strengths of your house.

The other thing I like about the game is the play time is easily shortened from 4-ish hours to 1-2 hours, without sacrificing any of the spirit of the game.

I won my first game w/ 4 players because I was able to host the games all but one time.  Why all the other houses let me get away with that, I'll never know.  Too bad it doesn't play more than 4.  I think a 5th house could easily be incorporated.  Perhaps the show only has 4 houses? (I don't watch).

RATING: 8
Players scheme and plot with and against each other to gain the most influence. First you play influence cards for gain or to the detriment of other players. If a card requires more influence to play than you currently have you can team up with another player to met the requirements. In the second phase you go to market and buy gladiators, slaves and equipment at auction. In the final phase two players engage in arena combat! 

Even though a quick game takes around two hours it feels fast paced and is extremely fun.

A couple in my group love this game so I get asked to bring it out regularly. It's actually a few mini games (bidding, set collection, mini-tactical, "take that" cardplay) stitched together pretty cleverly and thematically and it deserves credit for that. The problem I have with the game is that is that there is a lot of randomness in card draws which I feel dictate the game too much. I have no problem with the game's explicit "smack the leader" gameplay as many would; my problem is that the smacking is done with the play of an ace-in-the-hole card rather than a thoughtful plan too often. The game's intentional looseness absolutely does set up some terrific opportunities for deal making and backstabbery; this is where it really shines. We play it really for that element, but that element must be brought to the game for it to realize its potential. The game can also overstay its welcome; I would caution against "epic" length in almost all instances. I can't rate it as a new classic of thematic games as some are doing, but I do recommend it as an enjoyable game for gamers who love the theme and the social elements I've mentioned. Those gamers absolutely should have it in their collection.

This game is a great "beer and pretzels" brawler game which combines a lot of strategy with potential for plenty of epic moments, such as backstabbing other players and throwing down in the combat board. The dice mechanics for health in the combat phase of a turn are entertaining enough to carry the game, and the rest of it is solid as well (intrigue phase for cards and market phase for auctions etc). Also seems pretty faithful to the show, for those who care about that.

Overall a fantastic game. Quality of pieces and board are excellent. The ability to build up a gladiator system, equip them with various weapons, fight in the arena, back-stab opponents, etc make this game incredible. Thoroughly enjoy playing it. Would recommend at least 4 people to really have a good time. One down side is house Glaber and Batiatus are bit over powered/under powered (respectively) requiring some house rules. A lot of friends have never seen the show but still enjoy the game (and if you have seen show then this game is even better). Overall a must buy.

Exciting, evil, glorious thematic game.  It does a great job of emulating the TV series and provides for many exhilarating moments.  The bluffing and negotiation is well supported by the rules and the Gladiator fights are perfectly paced.

I was initially worried the game would be a bit boring while spectating the arena fights but I was very wrong.  Between betting on different outcomes and the table erupting in "Ohhh" and "Ahhh" with every chuck of the dice, it was a blast.  

The game is very random between card draws and the dice filled fights, but there is certainly wide room for social maneuvering and cunning strategy.  Excellent game.

The intrigue (and counter intrigue) cards are perhaps overly powerful and game-changing eg. lose two influence points! but I like the theme and the fights and the betting are entertaining. You won't make much on the betting though even with inside knowledge. Trashy sort of game in which everyone beats up the leader. NB. Make sure you bid for slaves and don't collect too many gladiators.

Inspired by the TNT TV series, Spartacus pits players against each other in the role of Lanistas.  Players buy, sell, and trade slaves, and pit their fighters against each other in the arena to win glory for themselves.

Unlike a lot of games where treachery and backstabbing is encouraged, Spartacus' mechanics allow for very free-wheeling, unencumbered way to form and break alliances.  Everything is left up to the players; bribes are paid and negotiations are made ad-hoc around the table.

My biggest complaint about Spartacus is that there is simply not enough gladiator-on-gladiator combat.  Combat is (in my opinion) the best part of the game.  Unfortunately only 2 players (out of 3-4) are allowed to fight each turn, meaning the other players are forced to watch others fight.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I love games with simple, sensible rules that are intuitive and easy to teach. Enter Spartacus, a game that can be taught in three fun stages: Intrigue, Market, Combat. Gameplay is based heavily on social interaction, which I also prefer in games. Perhaps the best part is that you can either choose to play as aggressively as possible, or you can (for instance) trade in nasty Intrigue cards for extra cash that will be useful for the market or for bribing other players. I'm usually afraid of IP-based games, but this is a big winner. You don't need to know the characters at all, but if you do, it can be fun to see their stats and abilities.

I owned this game... briefly. I had read a couple of positive reviews, and snagged it in a math trade. Then after actually reading the rules, I got turned off by the sheer length of the game. I don't mind a "take that" game, but it's got to be played in a reasonable time, and I can't imagine my game group really gravitating to this one. 

One of the few games I've traded without playing. I might never know what I missed...

Fantastico gioco di gestione della propria scuderia di gladiatori, che riprende il telefilm spartacus e i suoi personaggi. Un gioco diviso in tre fasi, delle quali le prime due di tipo tattico e la terza, "la fase arena" che si lascia alla fortuna del dado. Nonostante ciò un gioco che adoro vivere come un Batiato, o Glabro e parlare, corrompere gli altri giocatori nel corso della partita con qualche moneta, regole permettendo dato che di questo tratta il gioco. Con un pizzico d'interpretazione prende una marcia in più, sopratutto nella fase arena dove si può incitare i gladiatori e commentare l'esito dei giochi a volte anche rimanendone largamente insodisfatti e indignati e quindi sfogandosi con la pena per lo sconfitto in arena. Gioco perfetto per chiudere le serate con larghe risate e un po di panem et circense!

The ultimate Ameritrash experience. Make sure to play with the blue dice movement variant. Plays perfect with 4 and the primus expansion. Each phase is totally different and moves quickly enough individually, and all results in a 1.5-3 hour game that doesn't feel nearly that long. (We always start at 4 influence) Pulling off narrow arena wins and begging for mercy never gets old. Highly thematic and cutthroat, with memorable moments in every game. Can't recommend enough for those who like very high interaction games.

I think this is a better games than most people give credit.  It has several well flushed out elements like auction, trading, and making/breaking deals.  Also the combat system is very unique and fun, multiple paths to victory means you can focus on wining the battles or on gaining fame other ways and controlling the eb and flow of the game with $.
Only reason it's not a 9 or 10 is when 1 person gets an epic gladiator and no contenders show up in the market that player either gets excluded or the fights are too 1 sided (but I guess that's why you can shoot for control of the game in other ways/that still fits thematically)

However, it seems like the winning strategy is to hang out on the edge of second or third place so you can zoom into the lead when everybody else starts ganging up on the leader(s).  I hate gang the leader games and Spartacus epitomizes why I feel its a bad mechanic.

Incredible game play...honestly among the best I've played.  I would give this game a solid 9+ if I were rating it just on the merit of game design how fun it is to play.

You just have to be willing to swallow some racy flavor text...which is why it'll never hit my table.  As a fellow gamer put it, "I don't want to have to throw a blanket over the table whenever the kids come in."  On the game box itself:
"There is only one way to become champion; never ****ing lose."
...anyone interested in a trade?

Several plays, and loving it!  A great mix of randomness, planning, trading, and "beer and pretzels" miniature combat.  Me and my boys are talking about it and wanting to play again... always a good sign.  Put on some epic battle music in the background for that added touch (http://www.twostepsfromhell.com/)

This game creates an excellent, brutal atmosphere. It encourages backstabbing and I can see why it may create conflicts between players. All these factors should appeal to me. However I feel like the game is definitely too random. This can be seen not only during the arena phase, but also intrigue phase, where others may get precious cards and you may get useless ones(for the current game situation, of course).

Note: I have played maybe two 4-player games. I have to play more in order to reach a full verdict about Spartacus. At the moment I give it a 7. I'm not especially keen on playing it anytime soon, but I'll have to give it another try. 

EDIT: Eh, and the chance was not given. I sold this one. Maybe I'll regret one day and buy it once again.

Some great elements to this game , but ultimately flawed.

Early game is prone to run away leader, as everything is controlled by money via auctions, if you don't manage to secure a good income in the early rounds you are mostly sitting watching for the next few hours, random card draw  is the primary method to get an early cash lead.
As well as controlling the auctions (which controls access to income sources) early leaders get access to better cards via influence.

The game encourages the once per round combat to be horribly one sided for a guaranteed influence.

The endgame is basically Munchkin where the winner is the first player to not get their plans foiled by random cardplay.

These problems might be tolerable in a 2 hour package, but wear out their welcome over 4+ hours.

RATING: 6
it's not a bad game. In fact there are elements I really like (the 3 color dice fighting).  I dislike the way you can pile on someone at the end to keep them from winning -- while I'm ok with the premise of attacking other players, I do think that it should be somewhat limited on how much a player can get picked on in one round (maybe once per player in the intrigue phase --or something like that.)

RATING: 8
Spartacus is an intriguing hodgepodge of mechanics and phases that actually works really well and creates an enjoyable narrative. There is plenty of luck and take-that in the game which I feel really adds to the theme. Clever play (which might mean not winning the most) should usually lead to victory.

Don't have a copy...yet. (Update: I do now - +expansion, +promo gladiators)

If Munchkin and Risk had a baby, it would grow up to be Spartacus.

From Munchkin: Card play, leveling (influence), trading, negotiation
From Risk: Dice combat, with ties going to defender

Throw in some blind bid auctions and you have something much more than the sum of its parts. Sure, you can get unlucky on the cards, but you can still work around it if you can successfully wheel-and-deal in a game that encourages everyone to back-stab and betray. Adults only because of the theme, and requires a very necessary ability to laugh at one's own demise.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good game that includes a bit of negotiation, bidding, tactical combat, and take-that card play. Can be a bit of bash the leader towards the end that can drag the game on longer than it should. Also, combat seems to take too long. But I still enjoy playing this game.

RATING: 6
Fans of the show will see how the bidding, betting, dice combat, influence points and card mechanisms all play a part in bringing the theme of the show through to the game.

The expansion adds the primus game mechanism which really makes the game exciting and is a must have.

One con to the game is that players can stall the game by playing all their intrigue cards on the leader, but that is the reality of this style of game (negotiation, etc).

This game is fantastic! It's a board game all-star with its features, mixing bidding, auctions, trading, backstabbing and even miniature combat into a very entertaining mix.

The only thing that speaks against it is that victory conditions can often feel random rather than entitled.

A colorful combination of take-that cards and dice-chucking. As long as you keep things moving along, it's goofy good fun.

Starting with players at 7 influence felt like the game was over a little too quickly (it ended during the 4th round), but a low number would probably take longer than this amount of chaos deserves. I think 5 is a good starting level to let the game develop without overstaying its welcome.

Difficult to see how you could evoke a licensed theme any better with a board game. A pretty simple rule-set creates a framework for intrigue, back-stabbing and other shenanigans and then throws in some arena combat to boot with a more than decent combat engine which is fun for all playing and not just those who have gladiators in the arena.

Can run a little long if you play to 12 or if you start at 1 influence - however if you don't start at 1 influence some of the negotiation element for triggering the more powerful intrigue cards is missing. Perhaps start at 3 end at 11 - hmmmmm

Players represent Lanistas in Rome, running a school of Gladiators.  Very smooth and polished game where players maintain an economy, and use it to buy assets (guards, slaves and gladiators), and use these to try and accumulate influence to win the game.  Clean mechanics see scheming, deals made and broken, assets auctioned off, and rather exciting gladiator battles take place.  I really enjoyed this one - some really nice touches, such as the wagering system when two players face off in the arena - keeps the other players invested and interested in the outcome.  Excellent game.

Exceeded the expectations at our gaming table. Yes it's based on a TV-Show, but it captures the feel quite well. Games can last pretty long, but usually everyone is involved at all times, since gold can change hands for any reason. That leads to some interesting deals. Auction phase is pretty tense most of the time, whereas the arena fights fall a bit flat. Might change with more items/gladiators and playthroughs.

 I like that you don't ever have to win a gladiatorial battle to win the game. Far more important is betting wisely on those fights and tactical card play. There is the potential for a bit of munckining in the take that card game played each turn, but i get the feeling that the deck design will limit this. The combat system is pretty simple and intuitive and in general it deliveries the action the front cover implies.  In a similar way to Chaos in the Old World, each of the factions is strongly geared towards a specific strategy. In your early games you're working out what that strategy is, but once its know things can feel a little prescriptive. The game does contain some take that block cards that can totally scupper your plans and sort of take some of the strategy out of the game.

Hard to rate this game after one play with a variant, but it was a lot of fun.  I would need to play it more to come to an accurate rating, but it's somewhere between a BGG 6 and 7.

That being said, the constant interaction between players is what I enjoyed the most, but the battles are enjoyable dice-chucking events that even those not participating can get in on with the wagering in place.  That being said, with the final battle (as a tiebreaker) not requiring any wagers and money generally being useless for scoring, the game can feel a little longer than it actually is.

I have never seen the show, so on mechanics alone, I would definitely play this again.  Whether I would like to see it hit the table repeatedly?  Jury's out for now.

It's been a while since I've played this one, so my memory is a little hazy. I'll just make a few points:

-I don't mind vulgarity in any media except board games. It feels very unnatural to me.
-Combat seems flawed. I think there are forum posts about this regarding Speed being the primary resource... yes yes, auctions balance it... whatever.
-Felt too long for what it was and I believe we played the shorter version of the game
-The component quality of my friends game seemed quite poor (lots of warping on the boards), but that could be an anomaly
-Too much take that for my liking.

Really cool game with a lot of replay value. The market deck and its order decides how the game goes. It's possible that only one strong gladiotor sees play and he dominates the arena. But most of the times there is a lot of competition in the arena.
Be aware that you need good friends to play this with. You can screw somebody up that bad, that he will not enjoy this game. Me and my friends are all cool with messing up each other chances of winning, but for some people this game will be too competitive.
There are some issues in the game, but is suggest you go to the official site of the boardgame and check out the FAQ there.

Looks great on paper, but works out to be too long for the randomness involved. Endgame devolves into Munchkin, with players just countering cards/knocking down "leaders" until one player is "skillful" enough to hit 12 points when the others run out of counters/knockdowns.

This is basically a card game, and the movement aspect of arena combat is pretty weak, so it probably could have been a better (and shorter) game without having the board at all.

Fun, but too long. I think if you pull out a few cards you'll end up playing the same game, but within 2 hours...it wears its welcome out after a while, too many beat on the leader tactics, and too many easy influence gains combine to make Spartacus too loooong.

The combat is well done and like Lords of Vegas the deal making during the game is very free and devious.

one of the more popular games in our group. not very complex but a lot of gameplay. The players need to be aware that its all about backstabbing and plotting against eachother.

While the design alone doesn't warrant a 10 - the enjoyment I've had with it sure does. This is a very game-group dependent title - and I suppose it could really be a crappy 5 with the wrong group.

The game drags on for an entire evening - but is never dull. For me, every round is a little "minigame", and that makes the whole experience fun through the night. Win or lose, a gaming night with beer and Spartacus never feels like wasted time!

My experience is that it plays best with 4 or 5. 3 is only good for learning the rules - because you miss the ESSENTIAL alliance / backstabbing aspect of the game. 6 players is also good fun, but will drag on even longer.

RATING: 7
Really enjoyed this however it does feel like two games in one box,

Firstly there is all the intrigue and profiteering and backstabbing a al Rome, which is awesome but possibly could have had a little more depth. Some of the intrigue cards seem very powerful especially ones that gain you money if you happen to get a lot of them like one guy did when we played. This meant we were unable to really outbid him for the host which skewed the game slightly.

Secondly there is this mini combat game, unfortunately only two of the players participate in this mini-game and it can drag a little if they both have particularly good gladiators or bad dice rolls. Rumor has it that the forthcoming expansion will eliminate this minor niggle in that it allows a grand melee and the introduction of animals (I am thinking lions) to the mix.

The game owner has commented on its re-playability and after around 15-20 games he is bored by it as there is nothing left that he hasn't done which is a shame as I feel there is a lot more to explore with this one.

Overall a really nice game that obvious thought has gone into rather than just slap the latest theme upon a generic game.

Tiene unas buenas mecánicas, muy variadas y con diferentes fases: pujas, negociación, apuestas, lucha... y tiene una duración no demasiado larga (parte de 150min pero da opción a acortar el juego).

If I was to describe to you the three phases of the game it would not sound like anything special. A round of playing random cards that do stuff, a round of auctions and a round of dice rolling combat.

But when you're all sat around a table, playing a game about gladiators, watching what each other is up to, lying, cheating, backstabbing, reneging on deals, shifting alliances and finally besting a powerful gladiator in the arena – well – it’s a hell of a lot of, slightly mindless, fun.

Annak ellenére, hogy a sorozatot nem ismerem, a játék hangulata nagyon tetszett. Izgalmasak voltak a viadalok, nomeg az azokat megelőző intrikázások. Összességében végig jól szórakoztunk. De. Nem éreztem, hogy túl sok döntésem lenne a játékban, ami még nem lenne akkora baj, de kicsit olyan érzésem is volt, mintha látszatdöntésekkel próbálnának meggyőzni arról, hogy van ráhatásom a kimenetelre. Gyakorlatilag egyedül a licit az, ahol lehet valamennyire taktikázni, de még ott se tudjuk előre a feljövő kártyákat és így eléggé lutri valamiért esetleg sokat adni, holott simán lehet, hogy következőre feljön egy hasonló, de jobb kártya, viszont arra már nem lesz pénzünk. Az intrika kártyákat láthatóan meg se próbálták kiegyensúlyozni. Erre jön még a többi játékos kénye kedve szerinti hatások sora, ami nem igen sokat befolyásol a játékmeneten.
A harc se állt össze annyira nekünk elsőre. Minek az a nagy pálya, ha úgy se lehet menekülni a másik elől, és így mindenki egyenesen előre rohanva egymásnak esett. Nulla taktikázás csak dicefest volt a vége.

Szóval összességében a hangulat és a feeling szuper, de félek, hogy ez azért kevés lenne egy-két játék után, és egyre jobban zavarna, hogy nincs különösebb ráhatásom az eseményekre.

Vegyes érzelmekkel: 6.7

Initially, I was skeptical about this one. I've heard good things from other reviewers, but I felt like it was trying to cash in on the popularity of the show.

You get a lot of bang for your buck with this one and Spartacus is really fun at moments, just not exactly where you'd expect.

Spartacus is divided into three sections, intrigue, market and combat. The intrigue phase plays much like a game of Munchkin where you can play cards to dethrone others through scheme cards and defend yourself with Guard and Foil cards. 

The market phase is fun and uses a very unique bidding mechanic which is both innovative and engrossing.

Finally the combat which is unexpectedly the weakest point of the game. It feels tacked on. No real strategic choices aside from movement and initiative. The game turns into a dice fest much like risk, but with little strategic choice.

Spartacus prevails to provide an solid gladiatorial gaming experience. It needs work in several areas, but offers enough action and tactical decisions to keep players interested for a while.

Ameritrash game dripping with mature ancient Roman theme.  Creates a neat balance of "take-that", bidding market and dice-based tactical combat.  Surprisingly good production and quality for a non-standard game company.  One negative that can't be overlooked is that a gladiator with great speed and range is unstoppable.

The game offers incredible amount of replayability and I have played this well over 20+ times with different abilities and ages, each with a completely different feel to the game using various tactics and through player-to-player interaction.

Hands down this is my favourite board game to play because it has so many dimensions to it and is extremely well balanced. This is a game best played with four players and offers a variable length game (as set by the influence track).

The openness of the game in regards to backstabbing and deceit offer unparalleled levels of hilarity and air-sucking-through-clenched-teeth, as cards are played and deals are made that see even the mighty fall.

The blind bidding process in the auction phases offers a great opportunity to goad and misinform your opponents as you trick them into bidding high and buying low to gain assets and influence. The game allows you to perform dick dastardly reactions to those inside and outside the area that leaves even the most polite players cursing your existence.

As the play progresses towards the 12 victory point mark you will undoubtedly begin to form the most unlikely of alliances, simply to stop the other guy winning but at the same time, putting into place your own schemes to race for victory. Capitalise upon those players who have peaked too early and bide your time for the right moment to snatch influence and win the game.

If you enjoy the various aspects of trading, scheming, and battle you will undoubtedly love this game and I would not hesitate in recommending this to a friend.

Great backstabbing/intrigue game, but is let down a little by the simple combat, could easily be house ruled though.  I see the reason for the simple combat though, its to keep an already long game moving.  But still...

What a game!!intrigue,lies,backstabs,fights and deaths all in one funny game with simple rules who anyone can play.the battle has the same mechanism of classic risk but it is very intresting because of the weapons and gladiator"s abilities!a nice game especially for the fans of tv show.

RATING: 7
Negotiation, bidding, gambling, and a Risk like battle game between Gladiators - you need to master all of those to win. This is a game where player interactions and intrigue are more important than the game mechanics which are none-the-less functional and clear. The usual Risk problems can occur - King making in particular although run-away leader and turtling are less likley! 

Components are good although all the card art is only screen shots from the series. The gladiator minis are excellent. Very good.

RATING: 7
It's kind of like Munchkin...with a decent ruleset!!
Play to screw over your opponents. Lie. Cheat. Backstab. Make alliances and then break them. And don't be afraid to keep your weakened gladiator in the arena for an extra melee round...particularly if you've placed a bet on decapitation!! Quite fun. (Mechanically there is nothing special about this game, hence the 7ish rating.)

Update: I've played this a few more times, with the expansion now (5-6 players). The MAJOR problem with this game has developed into a time issue. It simply takes way too long for what you get out of it, particularly with higher player counts. 3 feels like not enough, but 5-6 can drag on FOREVERRRRR. (Alliances get more interesting though.)

It's a mish mash of auction mechanics, card-hand management, and dice combat. I like it...but there NEEDS to be a way to cut it down in time. Surely somebody could design a mechanism for this.

Played again and just not my style and didnt like the mechanics used. Intrigue phase isnt that fun and is stale. Not a lot of choices and decision making feels similar. The fights are entertaining but the downtime is to big for the result. I thought I would like the screw your neighbor mechanics but for the length of the game not worth it. Fun for an hour or two. Not for the next 2+ hours.

After a lot of bad experiences, I approach licensed games (especially when they have pictures of the actors on the cards) with care. Boy, was I surprised!

I haven't seen the show, so I was very pleased to be able to play the game without feeling like I was missing out on references or even jokes. 

The game is separated into two distinct parts. Outside the arena you gather resources, buy gladiators/slaves/equipment and attack other players. Then there's the arena fights, which are a (usually) 1 on 1 fight with interesting choices when you take damage.

It's better than the sum of its parts.

My group and I love this.  

As the dominus of a ludus, you must politic and fight to be the most influential (reach 12 influence).

The game has three main portions. The first portion, the Intrigue phase, is full of political shenanigans, bargaining, and backstabbing. The second is buying/selling items, slaves, and gladiators in the market. The final is a simple dice-driven arena combat, where you fight or spectate, betting on the outcome.

This game does encourage a high amount of player interaction, which means it can be made or broken depending on the play group.  

The game can run a bit long, upwards of 3 hours for a full length game (starting at 1 influence).  We've found that starting around 4 influence to be a good spot, not only cutting the play time down a bit, but also jumpstarting the first few rounds of the intrigue phase.

This game can really shine with the right play group. Has the highest highs and lowest lows of just about any board game I've played, and a very tense and satisfying finish. The separate phases make this a decent intro game as well, providing a taste of market bidding, hand management, asymmetric play, take that and combat roll that will also give experienced ameritrashers plenty to chew on.  Plus, I was a fan of the show, and the theme is superb in this game. It really pulls you into a depraved and despicable mindset that can be loads of fun (again, with the right play group). I have played this game with groups that I would never play with again as the game can become a bitter slog in the wrong company. Additionally, this is a 4 player game. Don't listen to the box. At 3 players you just don't get the right level of treachery. At 5, the game turns into utter chaos, and goes from 2.5 hour game that should have been 2 hours, to a 4 hour game that you will regret ever getting involved in. For all that is good in the world, don't even think about playing with 6 or 7 players, which the expansions will tell you is possible. Do not. It is a trap. Also, I house rule that to offer aid, you have to give that player one of your betting tokens which they keep. Once one person has given aid 3 times, they retrieve their tokens and gain an influence. I find it speeds up the game, and encourages power plays.

House powers are not that balanced and intrigue cards are terribly unbalanced.  I know player interaction is supposed to even it out, but some cards are flat out better than their counterparts and some have incredibly narrow applications giving too much power to random card draw.

I like the theme of gladiators and intrigue in ancient Rome, though I think the show was terrible.
The game, however, is great.  Squarely in the ameritrash camp, though there isn't much trash in that box, and most older gamers know that that type of game was created by games workshop when they used to spend more resources on game design than on lawyers.
The 16+ thingie is a bit ridiculous; it's there because of a few texts related to the series - yes, it's about sex but rather tame. 

All in all, a great game featuring a simple but somewhat verysimilar combat system that is loads of fun. Recommanded.

This is one of the few games that I really feel like the mechanics and theme couldn't have been better suited. I loved the politics portion of the game, backstabbing opponents and setting up my own defenses. Then once we're all done bickering and slapping each other the gladiators come out for some action that had me on the edge of my seat even when it wasn't my gladiators. When they entered the arena you never knew what was going to happen thanks to the die mechanic, I've seen slaves take out top tier warriors due to the players overconfidence. Even though its a dice rolling game I never felt like the luck aspect was overwhelming, the movement and item mechanics balanced the scales just perfectly.

Because of the bets, combats are fun for everyone, even if you don't have a gladiator in the arena.  Only thing I don't like is the the guards that only blocks attacks half the time  (at least they should succeed on 3-6).  Very thematic.  Some unbalanced leaders.

RATING: 3
It's an below average game, IMO. First, the houses aren't really balanced (although this isn't too big an issue for me with this game). More importantly, this game drags out really long, because you can very easily lower the influence of the leading player(s). The influence-lowering cards get reshuffled into the draw pile rather quickly, so this won't end too. The combat is quite random and with too evenly matched gladitors, first hitter gets a BIG advantage. If the gladiators are about 4+ die (in total stats) apart, the "lower" gladiator won't win almost as a certainty. IMO, the betrayal part of the game is highly overrated, when talking about betrayal, I think of the BIG stuff, diplomacy style. In this game, you steal a bit gold, discard one (of many) guards and so on. Meh.

IMO, one of the most overrated games @bgg!

Sold it, in fact!

This game is incredibly visceral fun, much like the show. The blind auction mechanic makes everything incredibly interesting, and the 'gotcha' nature of the intrigue cards feels like it balances out well. 

The biggest con is, in order for that balance to happen the game needs to be incredibly long. The middle length game (starting at 4 intrigue) lasts about three hours, which is just a little beyond where I feel it should be. If this game could be made into a two hour experience without screwing with the fun of it, this would be one of my favorite games.

RATING: 6
Well this is certainly a fun way to spend about 3 hours. Money is probably the key to the game as a few of the gladiators (Spartacus etc.) are all but unbeatable and it's important to buy them when they come up. Regular hosting is also important if you're planning to win the game. It all comes down to good die rolling in the end though, getting the first hit in the arena is a good guide to winning the bout and so getting the influence point. Great theme though, spread cheeks wide!

Initial Rating: 6.0 (December 2012)

I had huge hopes for this game (it has great theme), and at the beginning we were having great fun, however I found the game drags a lot and at the end we were mostly bored (and we played the quick game, I shudder to think how much boring would be the longer game). Simply put, the game is too long for what it offers. The “beat on the current leader” tactics extend the game time to unacceptable levels as the players will throw destructive Intrigue cards at the leader until someone manages to get through and win the game. Generally at this time, all players are tied and are 1 point short of victory so this guarantee you will have a long game in your hands.

The components are VERY good as is the combat system. It has a healthy dose of luck, but you know the odds and can manage the risk. The arena is gorgeous, albeit a little useless as the gladiators (generally) don’t use all that space. (But I think an expansion will take care of that).

I love the way you buy the position of “Host of the games” very thematic. I also love the negotiation, bribery and treachery needed, all of that is right up my alley. What (almost) kills the game for me are the Intrigue cards. I feel they are too unbalanced, sometimes they give up to 2 VPs while, at the same time, other cards are nearly useless. In a game this long, a lucky draw should not decide who wins and that is the main motive I don’t want to play this again anytime soon.

I’m downgrading its rating to a 5.0 because of the Intrigue cards, also I don’t enjoy all that “bash the leader cards”. A good idea that could have been a lot better.  

Current Rating: 5.0

RATING: 10
Amazing first effort on a game.  It's a simple "Take That" card game at hard with a helping of theme.  Arguably, it's too long for what it is but I've had alot of fun each time I've played.  Obviously, it needs a good that gets down and dirty quickly and backstabs easily.  It could use some variety and I have alot of hope on the expansion to round out the (very few) rough edges.

RATING: 7
Runs overlong unless you start at 7 Influence, in which case you don't get the full experience as much as if you start with a lower Influence number. Still it's a pretty good time if you have the right group that doesn't mind the time investment and enjoys a lot of backstabbery and "take that" mechanics in their games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Two plays only so far.

First ran short as I was able to grab a decent gladiator early on and then pretty much ran away with it in 45 minutes (short game starting with 7 influence).

Second game much more satisfying for all as we realised that you can't just play your own game, you must negotiate and act as a group to pull the leader(s) back as otherwise the rich just keep getting richer and end up winning easily.

Not the deepest, but fun, very (VERY) interactive and attractively produced. Due to the high level of player interaction (i.e. bashing), not one for groups of bashful weepies who can't divorce themselves from the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game pretty much embodies chaos.  Dice/Card Pulls/Gambling/blind bidding/Negotiating.  Generally when you throw this all together with a game that can run over 3 hours I say no thanks.  Honestly, it just works for this game.  I think the theme draws me in so some of the chaos doesn't bother me as much.  I don't want to play this every game night but this will hit a sweet spot a couple of times of year.

Good adaptation from a TV series to a board game. I do like the gambling and cheering for a gladiator and the schemes and flavor in this game, which provoke some nice table talk and laughs. On the downside, this game can drag on and just takes too long for what it is, especially with six players. The asymmetrical Dominus powers seem a bit unbalanced. The game suffers severely from king-making! A gladiator fight can drag on when a high speed + low attack gladiator is pitched against a slow speed with high defense gladiator and finally the game comes with a big dose of luck and randomness with all the gambling, dice chucking and luck in drawing cards. All in all; an excellent theme, but 'average' game in terms of gameplay.

Very good freeform negotiating game. Although there are structures in place to regulate the game, ultimately this game shines because players can make whatever deals they want. Even the rules (especially the arena rules) can be easily modified to cater to a more bloodthirsty crowd without going against the spirit of the game.

Minor quibble about the 1:1 gambling payout in the arena, if you pit an underdog against a superstar, the payout just doesn't seem justified.

This game is much more enjoyable if open bartering is encouraged.  Great fun was had with backstabbing and manipulating the bidding and card play.  The battle mechanic is a little weak and not a crucial part of the game.

RATING: 8
This game surprised me with how well it blends bluffing, backstabbing, and skirmish battles with minis and dice!  It's a new favorite that hit me from left field. Discovered it late, but it's fresh and desired on our table. Too bad there's "mature" content in the flavor text.  I understand the show was rated x, and I didn't watch after the first two episodes, but I'd like to offer this to players without having to worry about age or those who would be offended by seeing the profanity.

Ideas to try next play - Advanced market to get more cards and avoid times when some people get nothing useful. Maybe something like core worlds - Keep adding cards to the market until there are at least 6 cards continue until there are at least X gladiators (X=players-1?)
-Sacrifice guards to block schemes played by others against anyone, even themselves. Commit 2 guards to try to stop the scheme roll a dice to see if they succeed, (thinking 5 or 6 succeeds (33% chance) if they succeed they are exhausted, if they fail, they are discarded. OR roll a second dice regardless, and 1-3 they are discarded (killed).

I don't think there's a game that could fit my tastes any more perfectly.  The game is designed from the ground up to be cut-throat and brutal. Deals are made and instantly rescinded. Friendships are made and broken and made again in matter of a few rounds.

The Intrigue phase is often where the most interesting parts of the game take place. You can only perform certain schemes if you have a certain amount of influence (the game's victory points), but you can combine your influence with another players to play a scheme you don't have the power for.  Note, i didn't say you had to tell the truth! Wanna go in with me on a scheme and it'll get you a couple of gold? Yeah? Well tough titties, the scheme actually means you lose two influence and puts you back three turns! And yep, you helped me do it!

I've not even mentioned the simple-yet-strategic combat system that pits two players best gladiators (or not, if you want to throw the fight!) against each other and the fluid and simple bidding mechanism for more gladiators, slaves and equipment. 

If you're not sold yet, get this... You can be the host of the battles in the arena.  You get to decides whether the loser lives or dies.

Games play out in different stages and each stages feels completely different all while tying into each other seamlessly. The game's play time can easily be adjusted without affecting play at all which is a very good mechanism for me.

RATING: 5
Some cool elements but not sure how well the overall game flows:

The fights can be tedious if one guy runs away (which, if he's fast, is the right thing to do)

The end game 'bash the leader' is a pain and makes for a pretty random winner (the guy who goes for the win and is lucky enough that no one can stop him)

Single play went really well... additional plays may go up and down. May suffer from "Tall Poppy" syndrome. We'll see how future plays run.

RATING: 6
Ultimately this is a relatively straightforward take-that game stretched over too long a playing time (too long for me, anyway).  The gladiator combat in particular felt tacked-on:  necessary given the source material, but not well-integrated with the rest of the game.

All in all, it's not bad, but I'm not really the target market for this game.

Note: Theme of Sartacus is WAY more appealing then Reimplemented By  X-Men: Mutant Revolution. However, the streamlined system, and muti player interaction of X-Men is interesting.

In Spartacus: A Game of Blood & Treachery, an exciting game of twisted schemes and bloody combats inspired by the hit STARZ Original series, each player takes on the role of Dominus, head of a rising house in the ancient Roman city of Capua. Each house is competing for Influence to gain the favor of Rome. Through a combination of political schemes and glorious battles on the arena sands your house will rise in fame and stature. As Dominus, you have a variety of resources at your disposal. Guards protect you from schemes launched by rivals. Slaves run your household and earn gold. Gladiators compete to bring glory to themselves and influence to their Dominus.

I finally have been able to play Spartacus. After watching this game at two GenCons, watching numerous gameplay videos, and waffling about, I finally demoed this at GenCon 2014 and I am thankful that I did. Halfway through the demo I looked over at my friend who joined me in playing and I said "this has EVERYTHING I love in games, fighting, dice rolling, decapitation, take that card play, negotiations, slave selling,...." and he looked right back at me and said "It does, its the perfect game for you." It truly is. Not only does hit so many of my gaming sweet spots, but it also happens to be a IP of a series that enjoy very much so that is also a plus. I would have given Spartacus the award for "[b]Game of the Con - GenCon 2014[/b]" if I was able to play a whole game of Spartacus, but sadly I was only able to demo a couple of rounds before I had to pack it in. What I did see really awe struck me for the whole day. I'm still thinking of the plays that I had in those two short rounds. I can only imagine (dream maybe?) what will be possible in a full game. After playing I immediately decided that I needed to own the game and the expansion, but I had no way to fit in my luggage on the trip back home. GenCon fail.

This game has a lot going for it.  Has moments of great intensity and cheer-inducing events.  Excellent player interaction.  It's the go-to Ameri-thrash game in my collection. 

Two big things keep it from being higher on my list: randomness of the cards/dice and the length.  The randomness is what makes this game fun though...but it can be frustrating in such a long game to just have poor luck.  Secondly, this game is LONG.

There's a lot of neat things going on here.  There's resource management, auctions, asymmetrical powers (which almost double as asymmetrical win-cons), and tactical combat.  Surprisingly, most of these mechanics mesh together pretty well and thematically, even though I never saw the show.

Maybe the best game of 2012. There is a lot to manage, and disaster or glory could occur at any turn.

Make friends with the other players but not too closely.

This game is amazing...for the right players. It is a very aggressive play style with a miniature scale arena battle at the end of each round. It is also adult themed. No nudity on the cards but there is violence depicted and profane language. This is my favorite game, period.

RATING: 9
A perfect marriage of Ameritrash and Eurogame mechanics.  Feels like a bunch of smaller games mixed to create one big one but it's fun.  I'm a huge fan of the show so I enjoy it even more so.  But you need not be a fan of the Starz TV show to enjoy playing this.  There's plenty of interaction, trading, bribing, negotiation, and dice combat to sate most gaming needs.  So far I've only played a 3-player game but it was a lot of fun and I look to try a full 4-player game soon.  Will update once I do.  But for now it's up there as one of my faves.  

UPDATE:  A 4-player game of this is the only real way to play.  Cutthroat, nastiness, and skullduggery await!  So much fun.  The GF9 crew did a great job with this game.  Already looking forward to the next time I can play it.

Super thematic game with lots of opportunities for backstabbing. The backstabbing is a fun way rather than the GoT 'lose your friend' style, which is a major plus. The clever use of betting during duels make non-involved players involved. The whole game just makes sense. 
Downside: A bit too long, esp considering its luck dependent gameplay.
Recommended!

I've only played once so far, so the game we had was a bit skewed by us not really knowing the range in strength of the gladiator cards. It was entertaining, with a fair amount of player interaction and scuppering of each other's plans. The combat itself always went with the favourite on paper, however, so the outcome of battle seemed a little predictable.

I really like this but with a few house rules

I tend to play from 1 - 9

Combat is altered. Instead of rolling speed die and adding up for initiative, we roll speed die and pair off (like normal combat). 

Eg, P1 rolls 3 Blue die, P2 rolls 2
P1 : 1,4,6
P2 : 5,3

The highest from each player are compared. P1 has 6, P2 has 5 so P1 has initiative. We have rules for ties and stuff as well. This way, a player always has a chance of getting initiative, regardless of how many speed die. Makes combat more interesting, as there can be some amazing comebacks.

This game is awesome! I have taken it to a game session as soon as I got it from the mail and everybody who played it had a blast!

There is a lot of backstabbing and negotiation in this game, and everything is very thematic!

Its only flaw, IMO, is that it supports only 3-4 players. If it supported 5-6 players, the rate would be even higher.

The rate went lower after my second play, starting from influence 1, lasted for 4.5 hours, and went up again after becoming a huge hit in my gaming group. We played a game starting with 4 influence, it lasted for a reasonable amount of time and was a lot of fun.

A somewhat underrated game but will require house rules to make it more functional and fair.  Unfortunately the base game has lots of small glaring issues, but there are house rules that don't break the game and aren't more complex.

Probably the best game of 2012. Great components. Great theme based on one of the best tv-series ever. Very nice game play. Lots of player interaction and very little downtime. This game has the makings of a classic! 

Allows for variable playing time (but it will take several hours). Subtleties of strategy grow with more playings.

The first expansion allows for more players (and adds lots of nice cards). The second expansion adds another player and even more cards.

All models painted.

Light four player game you could easily learn when tired.

Fair amount of player interaction.  Some funny moments and as with any dice game some crowning moments of awesomeness and suck.

Treachery, deals, intrigue, gladiator fights. Tons of take that and back and forth. I have never turned it down and never had a bad time playing. I do think it goes a bit long with too many players, though. Sweet spot is probably 4-5.

Plotting, scheming and gladiatorial combat in Ancient Rome.  A game of epic moments for those involved in the action.  Unfortunately those on the sideline of the action don't get to enjoy it quite as much.

A slow build up, but the variable starting influence points enable players to decide on a shorter or longer game.  The dice can make things a bit swingy, but this very suited to the theme. Really enjoyed it on my first play (but I did manage to sneak away with the win).

Wow. Can't get enough of this game. So fast paced and so well balanced. Even when your not directly involved in a fight or a scheme you are right here on the edge of your seat because everything affects you. 

Close fisted betting and thumbs up/down are brilliant yet simple innovations!

Note: My only problem with the game is how addictive it is. As soon as we finish one game everyone wants to go again... Makes for some very long game night. I guess that's a problem I can learn to love with.

05/03/14 Played a three-player game in 2.3 hours. 
I liked the mechanisms, theme and that there was room for negotiation. It seemed fairly historical. The graphics were good and the production values high. The rules seemed clear. I'm not a prude but I could have done without some of the excessive sex and violence (like the blood soaked arena or cards with phrases like "with cheeks spread wide"). I suppose viewers of the cable TV show the game is based on got something out of this. But to me, who will never see the show, they were totally unnecessary and added nothing to the game. While playing it felt like the game was taking too long, but upon reading on BGG our play time was fairly normal. Even so, to me the last quarter did drag a bit. Especially when it was obvious one player had a gladiator *far* superior to his opponents, that basically couldn't lose. That wears on you even if it doesn't assure that player of victory.

For a licensed game this is pretty good. It feels a bit disjointed though. The market is fun, the intrigue phase is a bit too take that for my taste and the arena phase is fun can sometimes be a bit too chancy but is saved by the fact you can bid on the outcome. Plays a little long for my taste.

Not really my kind of game, but in the right situation it seems like it will be quite fun (think playing with teens or "non-gamers").  My one play was with my son, a friend, and his son.  Worked very well in that setting.  We played the short game.  I think I would always want to play the short game.

Blue Dice Initiative
Ramping Up Champion Variant
Combat Variant (anti-Kiting)
Faster Game Variant (2pts for Tribune)
Training Gladiators
Game ONLY ends after Arena Phase
2VP for Winning Arena (instead of 1VP)
Start with 2VP? Early risk for arena participation. 
Start with a little more as well? Maybe 1 gladiator?
Some slaves let you peak at the market deck... but if we deal out ALL 5 cards, should we even play with those slaves? 
First 1/3 of Market Deck ONLY has 2/3 Gladiators. 
Second 2/3 of Market Deck has Spartacus, Crixus and some 4-cost gladiators. 
Third 3/3 of Market Deck has some of the more OP Gladiators (Onamaeus, etc...)
Proposing Scheme Support - you must put the intrigue card face down and ask for support. If you do not get enough support, the card is discarded. 
Champion gets +1 ability (locked in). If you defeat a champion, you get also become a champion. 
Damage - gladiators do NOT heal after battle automatically. Any gladiator with a reduced dice pool is also considered injured and needs a healer to heal them. Otherwise they only heal a single dice. 
In 4-player Arena, all players roll initiative, then decide on battle turn order (use cards to show order). 
In Arena, # of players betting determine the odds. (ie. 1-2, 3-1, etc..). 
When betting on a gladiator, if there is double or more money on one fighter, the odds change to 2-1 and 1-2 (money won is rounded down). +1 gold for favourite, -1 gold for underdog. IF the betting difference is more than $10, the bonus is +/- $2. Always win at least $1 though. 
During Open Market phase you can make one single offer (yes / no)
Arena Mode: Find mechanic to avoid stalling too much?
The 2nd player invited to an arena battle MAY choose to select 2 weaker gladiators (i.e.. a 2 and a 3 to fight a 5), or a gladiator and a slave. 
You must pay upkeep to guards (1). 
Slaves generate income equal to their sell cost. Gladiator's require upkeep equal to their sell cost.

RATING: 6.5
The overall mechanism of the game is nice and varied, but it is not realized too well.

The battles are too simple and quite boring (movement has usually no meaning), there is very little way to influence them with the card. The intrigue and market cards are quite repetitive with more or less few mechanisms to employ. You may easily fall behind the other players for a single wrong choice or bad luck in drawing cards and not be able to recover to at least gain a runner-up position.

But otherwise the interaction is not bad and at least a couple of players fight for the victory till the end. To summarize: good rules, not so good implementation, but in any case worth to try once.

Spartacus es un buen ejemplo de cómo un conjunto de mecánicas al servicio de la temática dotan al juego de una gran interacción que proporciona horas de diversión. Y es que te transporta a las intrigas de la época, a la competición encarnizada por el poder y la influencia. Se puede tachar de muchísimas cosas a Spartacus, pero no de ser aburrido. ¿Qué se espera de un juego de mesa? Que divierta y Spartacus logra esto con creces, es tremendamente divertido. Pero cuidado, es tan divertido como  despiadado, gana enteros cuando se juega con jugadores sin escrúpulos. No debemos perder de vista el proposito final, que es pasar un buen rato en compañía y que es simplemente un juego, que nadie se enfade. Aunque no deberíamos olvidar al sentarnos a jugar que esto es Roma, y el fin, siempre justificará los medios empleados.

I picked up this one in an Australian pay-it-forward thread and have bene wanting to try it out for a while now. I had an evening out at the local games cafe with some chums and we all took along one four-player game we were keen to see hit the table. I chose Spartacus: A Game of Blood & Treachery as it's the game with two warnings - one on the box about it being for the 17+ set and the other in the rulebook saying that it's pretty mean but is still only a game.

Hard to knock that back. Anyway, as it turned out one pal didn't attend due to ill health but the game worked really well with three. It's a dice heavy game at times but one expects that and it's also terrific fun. Well worth a look. Might have to consider painting the miniatures now.

Been a couple years since I played this. Lowering my rating from a 7 to a 5. My tastes in games have changed considerably. There are elements of this game that I still think are fun, but for the most part I think it's too heavily reliant on good card draws. There's a thin veneer of strategy to this game, but in the end I think it still just mostly comes down to having the right cards at the right time. Sure, you can sink yourself by being bad at bidding and fighting, and picking on the wrong opponents (or conversely, failing to take the opportunity to pick on someone out of fear of retaliation), but every game I've played of this basically ends the same way - with 2 or 3 players in strong contention, and the win going to the player with the better cards at the end of the game. And since nobody wants to attract attention by creeping up slowly to the 12-point mark, that usually means that the last round consists of every player within striking distance dropping a whole hand full of point-scoring cards all at once. The first few games you play of this, that kind of ending feels exciting and tense, and there are laughs and groans all around the table. But it's not so exciting anymore when you've played the game a dozen times and you know it's coming. The same reason that people in a diner are never startled by the sound of toast popping out of a toaster, or a glass shattering on the floor.

Not sure what this game is trying to be.  It takes elements from a variety of games, but not necessarily the best ones.  What is the purpose of the arena?  95% of fights is just two people running into each other.  Higher speed gets first attack.  And you go on from there.  

It seems like there is a good game in there, but it is not quite fully fleshed out.  A lot of the mechanics seem to stutter.  The ending is severely dissatisfying, very munchkin-esque.  Negative cards toppling the first and maybe second person with the chance to win, before all negative cards are depleted and someone is allowed to cross the threshhold.

RATING: 7
Interesting the way a few gamers seem to draw some imaginary line between this and Munchkin. Munchkin is a stinkey, rubbish, novelty card game, Spartacus is not. Let's move on.

The game combines several different gaming aspects including card drawing and bluff, blind bidding for resources, betting, alternative victory avenues and dice based Gladiatorial combat. It all combines with its trashy Spartacus theme really well giving you a strong sense of Roman/Gladiatorial intrigue.

Don't get me wrong though, there's still a few negatives- unbalanced Character Skills, the chaos of the card/dice fest mechanics and the fact that for its weight it really is just too long, able to draw out to over 4 hours in worst case scenarios!

The high screw factor (in which players can gang up to play cards much bigger then they would normally be allowed to play) can keep bashing possible winners down and drag the end game out for round upon round (unless you manage to get 3+ points in a turn and surprise everyone).

Although I obviously see the merits of the combat system it can still sting like a bitch when you put in 'the Thing in the Pit' and he loses to a Starting Gladiator! The dice based combat system really is so chaotic that a decent Gladiator can be smushed with a couple of poor rolls against a half good opponent. Be warned! Guess if it was always a sure thing it wouldn't be nearly as fun.

Additionally the expansion is just what an expansion should be; more of everything with cool new stuff too! New characters, new cards and rules for multi-gladiator combat and to stop endless running away in the arena. Very good stuff. The next expansion promises animals- it will most probably be good.

All from a TV tie-in. I'm as surprised as you.

I'm not sure what all the fuss is about. It's certainly an interesting design, but our 4-player game simply dragged on. Lots of gotcha cards, and I did not like the "loan me your influence" rules. I like the combat structure generally, but it involves a ton of re-rolling which gets boring quickly. Ultimately, too chaotic and long for what what it is.

High player interaction. Very little downtime. Both good attributes in my book. You are always doing something fun or watching something fun. 

Rules are easy to learn and teach while maintaining just enough strategy to keep it interesting.

Good theme. You feel like you are managing a house of gladiators. I like the bidding. Game seems like it starts slow and finishes fast. 

Combat is fun. At first, I thought it wasn't deep enough, but upon further plays, I think it hits a sweet spot in complexity. It's a part of the game, not the whole, so any more complex and it would run the risk of bogging down the game.

Really want to play some more.

Played: 8 times.

UPDATE: Downgraded from 9 to 8.5 and then to an 8 after yet more plays... runs just a bit long, in my experience. The influence phase, in particular, can get tedious with all the back and forth.

I'm so in love with the theme, the combination of the mechanics (bid, wager, luck-pushing, bluffing, etc.), and the essence of the TV series is perfectly captured. I love how we scream whenever gladiators fight, so hype.

However, one minus point of this game is the limit of the scheme, equipment, and gladiator cards. I guess they have to stay within the TV series, but well, the more the better.
Another little note, there is so much treacherous as in its name, so make sure that you will shake hands after the match.

Normally this game would have gotten a 1 because of a colossal design flaw but, there was some neat design elements to the game so I bumped it up one.  The design failure is with combat.  We ended our game when in one arena combat one player refused to engage and just kept running around the arena.  With the game length effectively going to infinity we packed it up.  There really needs to be a rule to address this problem.

Based on my one and last play (3 players): The theme and artwork are great, however, the card play was simplistic and lacking depth. "Intrigue" cards did not really create much intrigue. What is promised by the lovely cards is pasted on, not delivered, and so it feels like an unfinished design and a missed opportunity. Didn't find the gladiatorial dice battles enjoyable at all, it was just chucking dice, not much to consider. It's for the less demanding, non-gamer crowd and fans of the TV show.

Draw cards and hope you can play them. If you can't sell them and hope you can buy more gladiators. Spend 10 minutes rolling dice in combat. Rinse & repeat.
Fall behind on the intrigue track and everyone else is playing the big cards and you're stuck playing the low cards trying to catch up.

Like Cyclades, ghetto Ameritrash. Granted, I am not a fan of the 'trash -- though this comes from taking a step back and thinking about the game and fairness elements. The actual playing of Spartacus was not bad -- but then again I wasn't targeted, although it felt bogged down (and this after having played the short version). It's the unfairness of it all -- there are quick and easy ways of gaining influence (VPs), quick and easy ways to target others to make them lose influence, and then some difficult ways to gain influence. Like all games of this nature, the way to not win is to be in the lead, since it's so easy to make people lose VPs. For all the rigamarole that goes into the arena battles, the victor in our game (me) was the one that purposefully lost all battles they participated in, made money off the losses, won some auctions with said moolah, got lucky with +VP cards, and didn't get targeted because they were cooperative and didn't seem like a threat. Just doesn't seem like the right way to win a game like this.

Played only "fast" game mode and I didnt liked it as I had the feeling that I was outside of the game. I was always skiped everytime when it was about the fight on arena.

When I finally get there ... those dice rolling and everything dependant on this.

I think this game is not in my taste mostly becasue of dice rolling.

Moreover the fight is a bit broken. When opponent have more dices in fastness he has so big advantage. He can jump to you, hit and then run and in the end you wont hurt him at all. But again - of course it all depends on dices.

Could be better in a full game where we start with 1 point at the begining. With 7 I felt I didnt participated in this game a lot.

Surprisingly good strategy/tactics game with negotiation, bidding, betrayal and nice miniatures, despite being a TV merchandise. It also really captures the gory, cutthroat, sexist, mean nature of the TV series very well in artwork, tongue-in-cheek card texts and most of all game mechanics!

Bought this game last night and me and a few fiends immediately popped it open and began playing. The rules seemed more complicated at first glance but as we started playing we realized we were overthinking it. It plays very smooth and very well. There are a couple ingenious systems in this game that I love. The combat dice, although simplistic, accurately depicts fatigue in the combat arena. I agree the combat could be made a little more strategic. I think the main thing they can do is change so that you can partially move, strike and finish your moves. I also think they should have an open market for certain generic items and have the better items auctioned as usual. That way you can immediately equip your gladiator with basic equipment. I think one good expansion that added an open market, a couple more players and rules for more than one combantant and this would be one of my top all time games. We found ourselves laughing alot at the backstabbing and treachery we were doing to each other. The game is from a brutal time and has brutal aspects but the play was very light and fun. If you have not played you need to get a group of friends and try it, I doubt you will be displeased.

One of my favorite games! This game has everything: sneaky cards to play on your friends, battles in the arena, and half-naked, blood-splattered gladiators! While that sounds like a lot of mechanics for one game, Spartacus's gameplay is very intuitive and incredibly simple: you're basically just getting ready for an Arena battle in every turn. Which means getting money (for bets or weapons), forging alliances and hobbling your opponents! I didn't expect much from the box: it looks like a trashy knock-off of a pornographic show. However, the center of the game is solid and fun. This comes with a caveat: don't make Spartacus into your run-of-the-mill strategy war games. From what I've witnessed, the players who make early enemies and make clear threats to win the game never do...it is usually the player who sneaks by without making any noise or wild declarations. Fantastic game to play and one of my favorites.

I came into the game thinking it wasn't my type of thing, there being free-form trading and leader bashing galore, and then random combat between two players whilst the non-combatants twiddle their thumbs on the sideline. And yes, it's all those things, but the sum of the parts surprised my on the upside. The free-form keeps the game relatively balanced, with events being played both for your own gain and against others to level the field (and you'll typically have a 50% shot at negating it anyway). Combat is a different, interesting and clever use of dice. Valuing different combat modifiers that come up on your gladiators and on weapons is therefore interesting as well. Which means even when you're on the sideline during combat, you're interested in seeing how the modifiers play out (as well as seeing whether your bets on the winners will pay off) because you'll likely be up against the winner at some point in the future as well. On the downside, there seems little incentive for the strongest to beat up on anyone else but the weakest gladiator and get the sure win, meaning it's a pitiless game, continuing to pound on the weakest player and I'm not sure the free-form leader hitting and deal making quite makes up for it. Meaning it's by no means a game I want to invest huge chunks of time in multiple times, but I can see its merits and wouldn't mind the occasional bit of fun with it.

I was expecting to hate this game, but ended up really enjoying it. you play against the others playing schemes and trying to knock others down while you try and climb up. But you also need to fight in the arena and everything is based on player interaction, you must work together at points and back stab each other at other times. Quite fun.

Some people have described this as a 'beer and pretzels' kind of game, and I think that's right. No deep strategy here; just make the best tactica decisions. The other players (not engaged in the combat) are kept engaged as they place bets on the fight, which is good. Certainly not a game for children as many cards have the sort of extreme language found in the tv show

My friends absolutely love this game, but I can't say I understand why.  My biggest complaint about this game is that it just takes too long for what it is.  (Example: I've played this twice -- the first went for over 3 hours and the second went for over 5 hours... and we didn't finish either time)  I'm sure we could go a lot faster if everyone stayed focused, but I imagine that'd also take some of the fun out of it.  But with that kind of time span, I'd much rather bust out Arkham Horror or Talisman.

If you like bluffing, backstabbing, and don't mind being at the mercy of die rolls, then I imagine you'll enjoy this game.  Personally, it's just not my cup of tea and I can honestly say I'd rather play just about anything else.

The game has some good ideas. Liked the intrigue phase where you get to mess with the other players or thwart their schemes. Even when they fail it is interesting since you are bleeding resources. 

The medium game seems to be the most interesting - since there is some position to lose early, the long game starting at 1 is difficult and drags since it is so hard to get going. Hadn't figured out the value to place on fighters and slaves versus gaining from hosting the combats. 
The combat phase is short - we went in and started hacking, didn't see much need for maneuver. Probably that is wrong - a few more plays will tell. It was important to get some equipment to help. 
Some of the gladiators, Spartacus I'm looking at you seem to be way over powered so much so I was looking for a way to "fix" the fight. Of course that is part of the game. I wonder if critical hit ie the lucky stroke that would double wounds that is something to make an upset more likely. 

An interesting game I'd like to retry

By Jupiter's Cock, this is the best boardgame I've played.

Rules are simple and smooth, perfect balance of game length and weight. Always close games and victory seems to be within the reach of everyone. Theme is a huge plus for me, and even a fan of Spartacus series. I'd recommend everyone to try this one, even if the theme isn't really your thing.

There is some sexual references and some graphical violence in cards, but nothing really over the top like in the television series.

Played two games and enjoyed them. The components are great, as are the intrigue and the game mechanics (overall). The actual gladiatorial combat, though, is not compelling; it's a dice-roll fest which is fairly light on tactics and decision making. I never drew/was able to purchase anything more than a pedestrian fighter, so in the three games I never entered the arena (and still won one of the games). I did observe a number of fights as the host (gaining influence) and discussed the feeling about the contests with players who fought repeatedly. We were left wishing that the arena aspect of the game had been more complex in regards to gladiators and decisions. Not many branches or sequels to the fighting.

RATING: 5
A pretty good fighting Mechanic going on here.  Too bad that they bracketed it with an impotent paced market economy, and an intrigue phase that is not intriguing.  Apparently backstabbing plays can happen, but don't worry, they only seem to happen during intrigue rather than when the blade can really be twisted effectively to interrupt progress in other portions of the game.  Apparently the makers built their hopes on metaplay and negotiations in turns of intrigue and backstabbing that did not occur.  Too bad that combat phase is surrounded by garbage.

This fantastic game makes excellent use of the source material, merges differing mechanics and lifts off the table in a way that seems to compel role-playing. It even has a great (dice-based) combat system. I'd initially overlooked it completely as a licenced game but, thanks to some excellent word of mouth, curiosity - and a love of the show - got the better of me. It's already vying for being in my top-five of all-time. A rare, special game that belies the simplicity of the rules.

There's a lot more game to Spartacus than I ever expected. There's plenty of opportunities to negotiate and scheme with your fellow players before going into the arena. In fact, most of the game lies in the intrigue deck and money trading hands.

Honestly, the arena has no business being as fun as it is. Mostly it's a dice-fest, but adding the placement of bets helps get everyone involved and the host getting to declare final judgement is always a blast.

Overall:
A surprisingly good game. It's light in all of the right places and heavy when it needs to be. I'm eager to play more.

Neat game with some interesting game play. However, it quickly turns into stab the leader and can be rather repetitive. I really think it would be better if you could have more than two players fighting at a time or a player could send more than one gladiator (apparently added in the expansion?). As it is, the game can really drag along. 

From my experience, the player with the SECOND best economy tends to win, due to everyone ganging up on the best guy. You have to focus on being good but not great, win without winning too much.

The game components are very well made, and the gladiator models are very nice (even if they smell a bit bad when new). I feel like I got my money's worth for the game, but I did buy it on clearance.

If you're a fan of the TV show or of Roman gladiators in general, you'll probably like this game quite a bit. I've enjoyed playing it and would play it again, but only with some minor house ruling to make the combat phase more interesting. As published, Spartacus is mostly a "Take that!" card game with some other elements tacked on to keep it the card part from being too repetitive. It definitely shows promise though, and I might look into the expansion to see if it expands the game into something worth regularly hauling along to game night.

Okay, it may not be the most mathematically elegant and balanced game. And it may have a whack-a-mole endgame issue. But if a game can be rated by the amount of raucous laughter it inspires at the table (and why shouldn't it?), then Spartacus is a clear winner. It's all about the extortion, bribery, and cynical manipulation. The gladiator battles also feel right, with oohing and ahhing over first blood drawn, and the bloody hilarity of mismatched fights.

Huge fan of the show, so was excited to try this one.

It ticks some boxes for me. Nice components, great thematic artwork, decent figures, long length of game, buildup of resources, ingame auctions/trading, player attacking..

But overall, the game just doesn't do it for me. The gladiator arena battle is fun the first one or two times, but then just starts to get boring. Especially when some battle combinations are unbalanced (trident is just absurd, very difficult to lose with it). 

It is a bit of a time investment required, so I don't really volunteer for this one unless there is nothing much else going on.

I am very bad with dice and rarely win even if I have more dice to roll than my adversary (in the game I played, theokoles rolled 1,1,1,2,2 and my basic Tracyan rolled 1, 1 .... says it all). The different auction mechanisms are nice but there is something strange about players trying to screw each other in turn rather than all at the same time. I enjoyed it but would prefer to play BB:TM.

16-01-2014: Good game. We played it with 4, but without expansion. I like the card play. But sometimes the rigid round structure make the game lose some thematic appeal. Why can't I plunder a dominus home when he's enjoying himself in the gladiatoral arena?

The downside for me was arena combat, which seemed to me a little wonky. It came down —for us— to a lot of hit and run and trying to stay out of range. This dragged the pace a little out of the game :).

For now a 7.

Impressions after first play: Loved every minute of it. Surprised to have finished our first game - standard length - at most in three hours including rules explanation. The rulebook is very well laid out and the whole thing is very intuitive. I finished last in our first game and had a blast: It felt like I had a chance even being more than five points (out of twelve) behind. I just had tough breaks with my gladiators, but even then I felt like me and my dominus had put in a solid effort training the most gladiators despite having most casualties too. And there was always something you could do to pull the rug from under the leading dominus. The card names and effects work very well together and are imaginable. And not only the cards, but the game round has lots of variety as well: There's deal making, open (!) trading, actual auctions really set at a market (yay for auctions where only the winner loses money), bidding and wagering - all these different modes of investment with subtle differences - and then the meaty fights. The fights are exciting and the dice system superb; they really make for a change of pace. Without them the game would be all bidding and such and would be as boring as most bid-for-cubes euros. Good on Gale Force Nine for putting a mature theme and age rating on the box as well and still pulling the theme and art off tastefully. For a series filled with gore, sex and whatnot, they've captured the sense of it just enough without being grotesque.

Love it. GOTY 2012.

I hate blind bidding, so I would have difficulty enjoying this game even if it didn't have flaws. And flaws it has, above all the arena combat that consists of interminable dice rolls to get a result which normally is easy predict from the outset. On top of that, the cards are preset to help the rich get richer; they have a bash the leader mechanic as well, but it seems that you need four players to get that to work properly. Also there's a lot of blind bidding, which I hate. Did I mention that? It's actually a pity, because I like the idea in principle.

Cut-throat game for 4 players (six with the expansion). Relatively simple to pick up. Not a game for young children or those susceptible to offense - mostly due to about half-dozen cards with swear words, and a few with implied (though not explicit) sexual content.

STRONGLY recommended to play with the Speed variant found on the BGG Spartacus forums which makes combat much more fair and entertaining.

I'm not really too sure what exactly I think of this game yet. The first play was sort of a let down. I felt like a lot of the game was a bit disjointed. We never really took part in the open market phase, and the intrigue phase was pretty lackluster. The combat was okay, but there are some really nice weapons out there, where if you don't have one, and you have to go against one, it's pretty impossible to win.

The best part of the game, for me, was the bidding rounds. That was a lot of fun. Just needs more plays to get it down, I hope...

I simply love this game. Tactics, LOTS of player interaction, beautiful mechanics - both how you manage your gladiators during an actual fight, and how you're allowed to trade gold at any time - promising whatever you like, and not keep it if you're up to it. Sure, games can drag out for ages sometimes, but they can also finish very rapidly. The "roleplaying" aspect, haggling and dealing, threatening and allying, raises Spartacus to an all-time favourite for me. The perfect balance of strategy, chance, and player interaction chutzpah.

This game weaves several distinct elements together in a way that most games just can't match. There is something here for any avid board gamer. I found the auction/bidding portion of the game to be my favorite, but if that isn't your cup of tea there is plenty of bluffing and bribery with some miniatures elements thrown in for good measure.

The game feels a bit messy with all of the phases it has, and much like Cosmic Encounter it feels like it's barely holding on to some semblance of a structure. Also like Cosmic Encounter though, it works. There's a certain social tension to this game that can be hard to replicate in a game with cleaner and tighter rules. With the right group Spartacus is a game that I'm almost always willing to invest time into.

Starting at 0 Influence makes the game a bit too long, though.

As a lighter, not strategic game with deep theme and some complexity it's good and would make a nice addition to a beer night in a pub. I was dissapointed however that there is not much real strategy to it, no complex plans. Can be fun, but was too straightforward for my group.

RATING: 7
This is a highly enjoyable game. It is certainly flawed - hoarding VP-boosting cards seems to be a very effective strategy that can hand a player a win seemingly out of nowhere, and game-end can be anti-climatic. But the scheming and the excitement over the gladiator fights are very enjoyable. I think it would ultimately benefit from some well-thought-out house rules, and some slightly more interesting betting options... But this is a good 'un - amazing quality for a TV-themed, low-priced game.

A rollocking bit of dice rolling fun. Lots of dice rolling! I prefer Moongha Invaders for my go to dice rolling game, but this one has a place in the collection too. There's blood, treachery and laughter, but the most important part is to value your auctions right and keep a good healthy stash of money to win the important auctions. Player interaction is high. There are some decisions to be made that involve thoughtful choices. Battles are a dice fest, but there's a few decisions to be made too - don't underestimate your blue dice in a fight and get yourself a weapon to get the first hit in (or a shield to deflect the first hit on you).

My main criticism is that Intrigue cards are a bit too similar. A bit more creative variation would have made for a better game. The randomness of the market can unfortunately lead to shortages in certain items in the short game. When playing the short game I'd organise an even distribution in the top half of the deck for a better game.

The medium game is the one to go for if you've got time, but even the short game will be worth it if you've only got 75 minutes. No one at the table is playing for the win so much as for the glory. Sure it's trashy. Sure there's gratuitous sex and violence. But it's fun.

I thought Drake's Flames review of it was spot on:

Munchkin meets Heroclix, with some auctions in the middle. It really feels like two games in one. The first one, a "take that" card game in which most of the winning is decided; and the second one, a tactical and simple combat game. There is luck everywhere, and some effects can be overpowered, but nevertheless it is still fun.

RATING: 8
[COLOR=#990033]This game rings a lot of bells for me. It's a unique design that's one part Munchkin, one part Modern Art, and equally one half parts Risk/Winner's Circle, with a dash of Intrigue on top. 

Let's dissect it in reverse. Turns have three phases, the third phase being combat, Players place bets on the gladiators, and then the players owning the gladiators duke it out. Combat is not particularly inspired, it's rolling d6's vs. d6's and comparing, but the way you accumulate wounds is clever, the gambling aspect keeps players not participating in the fight interested in the action, and it plays out quickly enough.

The second phase is a market phase. First players openly trade with one another, then blind bid auctions are held for gladiators, slaves, or equipment, followed by one last auction to be the host of the combat. This phase works very well! The open trading part was not very useful in the game I played, but it's also the only time you can sell unwanted gladiators to the bank for their listed value. The auctions in this game sing! In an auction, if two players tie for a high bid, they set their bids on the board and go through tie breaking rounds until there's a winner. This is fun because you can intentionally try to meet what you suspect a player to bid to force them into another round where they will have to pay more. Also if in a subsequent bidding round between tied players all players bid 0 the auction fails and the card is discarded! I find this guessing game aspect of the auctions very fun.

The first part of a turn is the intrigue phase. Here players play cards from their hands to benefit themselves, or benefit or hurt their opponents. This is the part that's like Munchkin, the cards are very much take-that style. The goal of Spartacus is to reach 12 prestige (similar to Munchkin's goal), you gain prestige through hosting fights, winning fights, and card play. The cardplay is fairly innovative in how you pay the "costs" of playing cards. On the top of each card is a prestige number, if you have that much prestige, you can play that card, simple, but say you have 5 prestige and have a card that needs 8 to play, you can solicit money and favours to have another player support you. As long as you and all players supporting you have enough prestige between you, you can play the card. This aspect of the game is very fun and keeps everyone involved on other player's turns. 

The one problem I worry about about the intrigue phase is Munchkin syndrome. That being an end game where one player is close to victory, get's pounded by the table until several players are near victory and someone sneaks by when the table exhausts their cards. This game does offer counter measures to this in form of guards, and the ability to negotiate to play cards might allow some very smart victories. I also don't know that if this were true that I'd mind, because I find playing the game fun. Getting to the end game is enjoyable, much like Battlestar Galactica, a three hour game which often concludes with the roll of a single, unmodified d8 to determine a winner.

I actually played this game twice, once the short game (with players starting at 7 prestige) and once the medium length game (with players starting at 4). I don't count the short game as anything other than a demo of the game because at that point you have so much prestige and there are so many cards that you can play unassisted that provide more prestige, that the short game is only an exercise in learning the flow of play and not a real game (ours was over in the first phase of the third turn). With that said, as soon as we finished I said "I want to play the real game", so it's a good demo at least.

In the medium length game there was a lot more politicking and deal making, it felt like there was more desperation and certainly more fun. Given that I've never played the game starting at 1 prestige (the long game) I'm most curious how the struggle to get from 1 to 4 points is. The medium game played in what I'd guess was two hours (didn't time it), and that felt right. If the long game went three I would be fine with that.

I find this to be a very interesting game. The design literally feels like three games tied together through your assets, I think that's very ambitious and the execution is fantastic. It reminds me of Win, Place and Show, but with even more going on, a strong sense of theme, and very streamlined play.[/COLOR]

Cool game with some excellent combat and blind bidding. A bit too much 'Take That' for my liking, but it isn't as half as bad as Cosmic Encounter and I'm the Boss. It does have a gang up on the leader problem, so coming from behind is usually necessary to win.

I don't usually like games where gold can change hands at any time and deals are non-binding, but the coolness of playing scheming Houses and betting on outcomes as gladiators of 2 of the Houses duke it out in the Arena more than makes up for it. The original, true-to-the-source-material design makes this more like the ludo version of Battlestar Galactica than A Game of Thrones. No other game has presented this kind of backstabbing + duel hybrid goodness except the failure of [thing=2950][/thing]. Simple take-that card-play with a system conducive to negotiation and a trivial board used for duels at its core, but it feels like something more.

A+ on originality, thematic integration and limitless potential for wtf moments, but the first-time designer and publisher let a lot of little flaws go through (e.g. combat stalling), so this needs a couple of simple house rules and ground-rules for making deals if the players need it.

[hr]
Another under-developed part is the totally repetitious nature of the game. Intrigue, buy stuff, fight, repeat. Training or developing the assets you own in an organic way would add a nice touch. Cards are unpredictable but not varied enough.

Also, the long and standard games are too long for a game with this much randomness (evinced by us decking out the Intrigue deck easily for the standard game), especially as Domini don't want to make themselves a target. Yet a short game is just a card-play bonanza (since you meet the requirements easily) of end-game leader-bashing. Better control over the game length would have been appreciated, e.g. starting at 7 but raising the influence cost of cards.

End-game leader-bashing is somewhat like Munchkin. Did I just compare this to Munchkin?

Too long for the randomness and repetition, too short for the effort. First play is a hoot though.

This is one of those games that almost feels like a couple of different games mashed into one.  You have miniature combat, Risk-like game fight mechanics, card-play, auctions, etc.  I enjoyed my first play of this, but probably moreso due to the company than to the game itself.  We started at 4 influence and in hindsight probably should have started at 7 for the short game as it went TOO long for what it is.  The Arena phase is pretty simplistic and once you get the speed advantage on someone and you win initiative - one good hit and the other guy is toast.  All in all, it's ok and I won't get rid of it until I see the expansion, but I have to be honest and say that I am truly surprised at how high this game is rated on here.  One caveat though - do NOT play this with people that cannot take a little backstabbery.  The game specifically advises not to be an ass about it.

The game is very thematic and appropriate to Spartacus and Rome in general. It offers up a number of ways to go to achieve victory and the bidding and money system is very appropriate. 

The cards are a great way to screw with people and are well thought out. Combat is well done as well, with the methods for loosing dice and dying or surviving playing out well.

A winner all around!

If this game weren't so funny I wouldn't like it as much but I had a lot of fun with it and it was a hoot.. I really like the concept of dudes battling it out in an arena, people betting on them, deciding if they live or die, etc.

Combat was sort of the lightish side, but the dice provided lots of excitement so it was satisfying. The combat feels like it needs some more surprises, like maybe hidden cards that can have an effect and allow people to bluff, and that would make the betting more interesting I think too. 

Mostly comes down to bidding and gold management I think (which is fine). Game was fun but felt underdeveloped, great ideas that should be executed better:

*The end game is a slog, bash the leader ane cycle through the deck fast enough till someone has a combination of +Influence/-Influence/Counters to win. You do have control over much of this, in theory, as many of the best cards have prerequisites, but... you draw so many cards each round and theyre chruned through so quickly that the end game just feels totally chaotic

*Everyone seems to ask why there are no multiplayer Gladiator melees. Not every turn maybe, but it would be awesome if they came up!

*Game is simply too long for a game of this lightness with not enough development to justify the length, past a certain point you're just waiting to have the right combination of cards (and your opponents to lack it) for the win. This can easily be the last half of the game.

(2 Design + 3 enjoyment)

Also, on first play did not realize how incredibly powerful some of the gladiators are relative to the vast majority of others (probably because I don't watch the show).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is mostly a negotiation game based on the Starz original series (which I never saw) where players collect and spend money on slaves (income producers), gladiators (used for fights, another big part of the game), and other miscellaneous things like equipment for your gladiators and guards to protect you from attacks played by your opponents.

I like the mechanic they used to encourage a little extra negotiation among the players; during one of the phases players draw and play intrigue cards, many of which are used to attack your opponents such as steal money from them, injure their gladiators, or lower their honor level (this game's victory points).  You need to have a certain honor level to play these cards though and are able to combine your honor level with supporting houses.

The other big part of this game is the gladiator fights which in my one play so far are a little disappointing.  I like the idea, especially the way the hosting duties, invites, and deciding whether the loser lives or dies are handled.  But the fight itself is a Risk-style dice chain system where attack dice are matched against defense dice and are usually just decided by lucky rolls.

For the most part I like this game.  The mechanics used to encourage negotiation are good, the slaves and gladiators have different special powers which makes them interesting and the underlying mechanics of the gladiator arenas are actually interesting and well-designed as well.

I don't love it though, a big part of it being, as I said, the  dice combat system used for the gladiator fights.  The other reasons I didn't exactly enjoy my first game can easily be avoided though.  For one, despite what the game suggests, I don't recommend playing the "quick game" that has players start at 7 honor.  At that level most of the intrigue cards can already be played and all of them can be played with the support of just one house.  This makes it a lot less interesting when you can play every card out of the gate.  I recommend setting aside enough time to play the normal or even the "long game".

Also, and I know this would extend the game length as well, playing with 3 is a little uninteresting which I think is a poor number for any negotiation game.  Negotiation games are at there finest with more players so there is more wheeling and dealing.  With 3 it is easy to identify who is winning and the other two tend to gang up on that one player.  the base game supports 4 players and with the expansion you can accommodate 6.  I recommend at least the four even though this is looking like a 3-4 hour experience at that point.

Like a too-slow slice from the sica of a Thraex, this game was a swing and a miss for me.  I'm normally all over these "thematic experience" games, however I think the fact that I've never seen the TV show on which it was based didn't help this particular game.  But even when diving below the surface, the game play and its hodge-podge/mish-mash of mechanisms didn't work for me either.  Probably the most disappointing aspect was the gladiatorial combats, which failed in 2 areas: First, the fight mainly involved the 2 combatants running up to each other and then throwing buckets of dice for a while - there didn't seem to be much tactical play required for the actual combat.  Second, this combat phase resulted in fairly lengthy downtime for the non-participating players while they watched the other 2 sit there and roll dice.  If there was a way that 2 separate but simultaneous combats could have been happening in the arena in order to involve all players, that would have been much more ideal.  My other major complaint with the game play was that the end game just draaaaaaaagged (and we played the ultra-"short", start with 7 Influence, version of the game!).  One player would hit the required 12 Influence for a victory, but another player would play a Guard or another card to cancel the effect and knock him back again... and repeat ad infinitum.  The game's components were excellent (LOVE those plastic gladiator figures!!), and I feel that so much more could have been done with those great bits and that super-exciting theme!  Having said all that, I do see how a group of players who are familiar with the source material, who get into "character" to a certain extent in an RPGish fashion, and who embrace the wheeling/dealing, treachery, negotiation, bribery and backstabbery that really elevates a game like this, could have a pretty good time with this one.  Game design: 2/5  Personal enjoyment: 2/5  Total: 4/5

Awesome and thematic game. Can be very long and swingy, but the theme and mechanics are very intertwined and make a game where story points emerge organically from playing, which I adore in a game.

A distinctly adult theme -- not recommended to play with kids.

I love the mechanics of the game, but just don't like the theme. There's something greasy about a game of buying and selling slaves. Then sending them to fight to the death -- or hell, even just "exhausting" the sex slaves.

That being said, it is kind of fun getting into full-on scheming bastard mode when playing this. And yes, it really does fit the trappings of Roman families vying for power.  I don't know.  Mixed feelings at best.

Game of bluffing, trading, wagering and just scheming and jockying for the best position, alternating with nice simple man-to-man combat.

Bumped into it at Essen 2013 and from recommendations of a friend bought it. Really, really glad I did. Normally won't buy a game based on a TV-series.

But this, together with Battlestar Galatica, is one of the few exceptions to 'games based on IP are really, really bad'.

Really liked it, it was an enjoyable rump. Not much deep thought, just plain raw fun. Will go down perfectly with my gaming group.

[EDIT]Played it a second time, and it wore on me fast. Found myself bored a couple of times. OK, this could be from the fact that I was unable to pay my Gladiators as 'the gladiator'-house, but I did found the flow of the game becoming tedious: the combat + wagering is still very nice, but the cardplay and upkeep an unnecessary drag. Rating dropped by one point. This, combined with the fact I simply have too many games, means it will be traded/sold off.

[EDIT SEP 2016] Sold it off, discovered a friend of mine was shocked as it was his favorite, managed to acquire a cheap copy back for even less as I sold it for and played it a couple of times since. Still not my favorite as I find it too lightweight, but absolutely a blast when played with said friend. For that reason, a keeper.

Don't play this game. It isn't very good. I can't for the life of me figure out why I like it so much.

Its individual pieces don't quite work, is the thing. Especially the messy galditorial combat mechanics. But the whole game fits together in a way that just sort of works. Somewhat like Wiz-War it is a consumate Take That game without the small footprint and rapid play time that makes something like Uno popular or the underlying cleverness that makes Cash and Guns, Welcome to Dungeon and Cutthroat Caverns work ... but it manages to express its messy, half-formed mechanisms into a thematically coherent incoherent mess. As long as everyone is on-board with an imbalanced, back-stabbing romp through ancient Rome, Spartacus just kinda *works.*

The short game was oddly entertaining. It shouldn't work in any way; the combat is often one sided, the 'intrigue' is all based on random card draws (though being able to sell them is a decent balancer) and the game looks as though it would end all to often in a bit of an anti-climax.

I'd never play the long game, but there appears to actually be some promise here...

Update: Okay, so I've now played the medium game and... it ends in a Munchkin style, bash the leader until we run out of bashing cards. Sigh. Each aspect of the game; intrigue, market, combat is fairly unexciting (the market phase would be good, but the wild imbalances in money prevent that) and repetitive. My interest in this peaked briefly and then came crashing down.

Rating down from 6.5 to 5.

The game amounts to a lot of player negotiation centered around a lot of chrome. For what it is, it works well, but for my money, something like [thing=39463]Cosmic Encounter[/thing] does the same thing a whole lot better -- and with a whole lot less hassle. If you are a fan of the theme, and especially if you are a fan of delicious backstabbing, go for it. Be aware, however, that the game is long and filled with luck. I can handle luck, but for me, there is too much fluff. What I prefer are focused, meaty decisions. Instead, I get constant maneuvering that requires a lengthy negotiation in the realm of metagaming. Who hurt who's feelings is not a decision space I want to game in.

The game makes some solid design decisions, but the game feels long for the amount of dice- and draw-oriented luck in it. 

In addition, some of the factions feel dreadfully inadequate when paired against others.

I feel like a game of King of Tokyo would be both more entertaining and shorter in almost every scenario, but Spartacus has made me want to keep my eye of Gale Force 9 in the future.

RATING: 6.5
I enjoyed the first half of this but then the game dragged. The politicking is fun, and the combat is also fun, if overextended.  But it has my all time least favourite game feature, where everybody gets together to cutdown anybody who looks like winning, until eventually everybody staggers over the line at the same time.  

In our game, one player (me) reached 12 VPs after 2 hours before being hit with a reaction card, then it took another 2 hours of exhausting back and forth before three of reached 12VPs simultaneously (and it could have been all four with slightly different decision making), finishing the game with an anarchic combat.  I'd have had more fun if we'd finished the game at two hours and moved on.

Spartacus is one of the most successful television-to-game translations since Battlestar Galactica, yet the experience fails to ignite.  The arena fighting was surely meant to be the centerpiece of the game, yet it happens infrequently and is a bland affair of rolling dice and comparing pips.  The other games of gossip and intrigue are reasonable, but there are far too many cards that bash the leader.  It takes a long time for a winner to emerge.

RATING: 8
A gory bucket full of blood-spattered flavor and gruesome conniving. If you've always wanted to try your hand at running a gladiator school, play this game, even if you're not familiar with the tv series at all. Just play with friends who like to speed through their turns... this is a game of action, not words.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very solid game.  It strikes pretty much the perfect balance between integrating lots of theme, characterization and chrome without bogging the players down in rules exceptions and detail.

As a fan of the TV series, I appreciate how much the game feels like the show, from the sleezy political and economic machinations of running a ludis, to the micro-level galdiatorial battles that basically play out in "bullet time" (though the game's biggest negative is that the combat can take way too long to resolve).

As a person who is often the teacher of the game being played, I appreciate the low rules overhead.  Any casual gamer could pick it up in no time.

As a person who buys (too many) games, I appreciate that GF9 released a game with great production values, but didn't bog down the game with "stuff."  The low price tag is a steal when compared to comparable games.

Never seen the show, don't care.  This is a really cool game!  The bouts are satisfying, especially when a crowd favorite hits a winning streak, and the political game is well-done.  It's been interesting to see our perceptions of this game evolve -- it's easy to overbid on big flashy gladiators, but having a solid economic base makes it much easier to control how the game plays out, and that means prioritizing slaves...unless everyone else is overbidding for them!

I'm still stunned at how much fun this game was to play.  I expected it to kind of be....well, terrible.  But it was just a great game to get out with a group that is looking to joke around and back stab each other and cheer for beheadings. 

There is plenty of strategy, a solid bidding system, decent diplomacy, plenty of paths to win...for example I've seen one player openly avoid confrontation, employ useless gladiators and still manage to win while everyone else engaged in d-measuring contest in the arena.

I wouldn't want to play it all the time and the long game can be too long but it's a great option to pull out a few times a year for sure, and it's inexpensive to boot.

The one caveat is that the game can devolve into a meta game of whack-a-mole on whoever gets to 12 VP and the ultimate winner can wind up seeming like the lucky person who happened to get to 12 after everyone spent all their ammo.  I don't know if that's strategy or luck, and if an unsatisfying victory is not something you find acceptable about a 3 hour game, this might not be for you.

Highly interactive, great fun. At its best when starting from low influence, but then it can go very long. The somewhat unpredictable length is problematic in getting it to the table. The intrigue phase is the strongest part of the game. Arena fights vary from being predictable to very exciting, use of the blue dice variant is recommended. Some houses are clearly stronger than others, we tend to leave Glaber in the box, as he is just OP when playing from low influence, giving him plenty of time to amass an army of guards.

Great game, with the expansions you can fight with more than just 2 gladiators (players) per turn. And removes what i think is aggravating personally, the ability to gain victory points without being blocked via house special rules. Add expansions and this jumps to a 9.5 for me.

A lot of fun, nothing new, but a lot of game mechanisms not seen together before.  I love wheeling and dealing negotiation games, I love have an auction phase, and I enjoy tactical mini combat, so his game was a bit of a no-brainier for me.

It's not without it's flaws though.  It drags a bit early on.  The pig pile on the winner until someone sneaks by with a win a la munchkin is present somewhat, fortunately there is a lot of side strategy in how you get there and maybe pull off a surprise win.  The tactical combat can be ridiculously one-sided and as a result a bummer if you can't get your hands on a real gladiator.    Because of this I feel like the mini gladiator card expansion is needed to increase the chance of getting a good gladiator.  Probably my biggest issue though is that the houses themselves seem imbalanced.  One guy can score cards and points simply by having guards, an already useful card on its own, while another house needs gladiators which cost upkeep.

All it's flaws aside, can't deny that it's always riotous fun every time it hits the table!

This may be the ameritrashiest game I’ve ever owned. You can raise the game to mediocrity by implementing some house rules (conditions for 4 gladiator fights, starting/ending influence, fighters movement during combat rounds), but out of the box, this game is really dull and dimwitted garbage. I gave my copy to a friend with the caveat: if you’re ever in the mood to play, please don’t call me.

RATING: 10
Believe the hype. This game is a blast. I haven't had this much fun playing a social negotiation/backstabbing game since my first play of  Battlestar Galactica during that game's Gen Con debut. Spartacus features auctions, gambling, take-that style card play and even a quick tactical combat mini-game, yet it doesn't bog down while bringing these various mechanisms together into a coherent game. My first play-through, I think I only had to consult the rulebook maybe once or twice. That's a real credit to the rules, especially when you consider what an ambitious game design it is.

The gladiatorial combats are exciting, with the various gladiators differing enough in skill level to allow for educated bets on their performance, without being so lop-sided as to prevent upsets. Experienced, stud gladiators will die unexpectedly to weaker opponents, and sometimes even an untrained slave can hold their own for a turn or two. Surprisingly, it can be almost as fun to watch the dice play out for someone else as it is for your own gladiators. I suppose that's a key factor as to why this game works, as it is possible to go multiple turns without ever being involved in the gladiator games. That could have been a serious detriment to keeping everyone interested, but the gambling component and the drama of seeing each gladiator's fate play out is just enough to keep things moving for everyone.

The only downside I have seen is the game's length. It's never boring, but it can be somewhat frustrating to achieve victory. Toward the end of a session, Spartacus can take a stroll into Munchkin territory, where everyone at the table absolutely pummels the leader whenever they close in on the final victory point. That can drag out the endgame a bit, but it's a minor nit-pick. Even when the game starts to run a little long, there are a few ways to break the deadlock and grab the win. That can be exciting in its own right, when you finally pull it off...so it's certainly not a deal-breaker.

This is a solid 9 for me and might even claw its way to a 10, when the expansion adds the rules for team combat. Right now there is really no reason to maneuver after first blood is drawn, so adding additional fighters to the arena should add a few more tactical considerations. This will also add tension to the auction phase, with everyone needing to build teams of gladiators instead of putting all their gold into one homicidal basket.

This game is the best example I can think of a licensed board game. (even better than Battlestar Galactica) It plays precisely as you would expect a board game based on the show to play. The intrigue is interesting and dynamic.

The only downsides to this game are much longer play time than expected (fastest game mode plays about 2.5 hours with three people for us) and during gladiatorial bouts, some players get left on the sidelines while they're fought out.

I love this game. It keeps my interest peaked from the beginning to the end and during each phase of game play. From the card play, to the auction, to the gladiator battles, it is all fun for me. Not only is there a bit of luck from the cards and dice rolling, there is a lot of strategy and diplomacy that make this game very engaging and social. Every game we have played, there has not been a clear winner until close to the very end, and there have been some awesome come from behind wins. One of my groups very favorite games.

The fighting has one of the best combat mechanisms I've encountered. It makes sense, is fun to play, and throws up some good decisions.

As a huge fan of the TV show I was inclined to like this game. It's simple, but very immersive - you really do feel like a Roman Dominus struggling for power and influence. The level of player interaction is huge, everyone at the table is involved all the time. It's not exactly "my type" of game due to significant luck factor, but I had a blast playing it anyway - there was a ton of super tense die rolls, laughs and emotional outbursts of joy and excitement during arena battles. I'm aware of every shortcoming of this game (and there are many), but this doesn't stop me from really enjoying it.

[b]/update:[/b] I don't recommend playing this game with more than 4 players as it really drags and extra players do not add anything to the overall experience... Four is the sweetspot.

[b]//update, February 2018:[/b] Downgraded from 8 to 7. After playing it some more I came to a conclusion that it's just too long for what it is. Each phase starts to drag after some time. The social aspect is still great, but Spartacus lacks "body" in terms of interesting mechanics. It's a cool game overall, but only in small doses.

Great game, easy to get into, & can be quite quick. At some point though you will drop out of the engagement and wonder just what it is you are "modelling"! Title does say it.

Ha!   Over the top flavor text adds to the fun of this confrontational, in your face game about gladiator battles.  

I'm a bit concerned that end game will usually be a bit anti-climactic as someone squeaks through sacrificing his assets to win.  But, we only played the short game, so not quite sure.

I'm looking forward to another play of this game.  Rating may go up, but not likely to go down.

Fun theme, but poor gameplay.
It pretty much comes down to half take-that, half dicefest.
The game would be enjoyable for a mindless hour, but it well overstays its welcome.

Seemed cool at first.  Felt very thematic and fun for the first 30 minutes.  But then, it dragged, and dragged, and dragged on until you realize you have been re-watching episodes of Quantum leap in you head for the past 20 minutes while waiting for 2 of the 5 people to FINISH THEIR DAMN GLADIATOR BATTLE ALREADY!!!  Gaaaaaawd this game is a disappointment. -edit-  much like level 7. I played this with "that guy". Man that guy is slow. He has ruined more games for me than I thought possible. I have to try this again.

[GAMEID=130101], 
and [GAMEID=132554]

And the expansions [GAMEID=134466] and [GAMEID=164270]


The play count really doesn't reflect how much I enjoy this game; it's quite a long one (or can be) and most of my wider gaming group aren't up for playing it as much as me

I really like the Dice String mechanic - it makes it more than just who can roll the highest dice, though naturally, if you roll high, you will more likely win...

promos can unbalance the game, especially if one player gets hold of more than their share, but you can't really deal them out at the beginning. considered making them an addition for late in the game, possibly when the first player gets to 7 influence, with the player in last place choosing first, but not sure how well that would work.

Serpents and the Wolf pushes the game to six players, which will probably lengthen the game if you fill all the seats.

The expansion also adds a different style of intrigue card, where you either need to be higher or lower influence than the person you're targeting with the scheme - a very nice touch.

Let's see.

Arena combat tends to be lopsided and speed-dependent, and is potentially broken.  The pinnacle of disappointment is that combat is limited to only two players.  That's fencing, not gladiatorial combat.

Having gobs of money is crucial, yet that's mostly dependent on random card draws.  Earning VPs wins you the game, yet that's mostly dependent on random card draws.

People who enjoy constant negotiation and arbitrary smackdowns may find something to like, but that's a category of game that I happily divorced years ago.

There's probably an expansion that will fix everything, but if it adds more players (and more time) then I'd rather count the number of hours remaining in my life - in real time - before spending any of those hours on [i]Spartacus[/i].

Blind bidding, take that/kick the leader, and plenty of dice with a pretty uninteresting combat mechanic. Reminds me of Munchkin in feel. Also takes too long and the endgame is just an even greater dissapointment.

Great game with a lot of variety in gameplay. Has a lot of social interaction and a lot of stages. Sounds complicated, but is really rather simple to play. I only wish the combat system at the end of rounds had a bit more meat on it. Not much, but just a bit more.

Also without expansions the 4 player limit feels a little tight. Game can also drag on for a very long time.

This is my style of game. Violence, deal-making, backstabbing, negotiations, bluffing and down-right lying. Awesome!

All this set to the backdrop of running a ludus in ancient Rome - fantastic!

The components are great, and I have further enhanced my copy with a set of painted gladiator miniatures, and metal replica Roman coins.

First Impression: The rules seems neat. It's a very social and cut-throat game. I reckon this is one of those kind that you're playing the other players, not the game.

Component quality could be better. The material is good, but the art direction is average at best. There's some bad photoshop work in some of the cards.

First Session: It was a blast. Can't believe a game this simple can be very fun to play. I've never played a dicerolling game this tense.

Feels like it's trying to be too many games at once with minimal connections between the elements. It's not awful, but it has too much of "take that" and "hit the leader" for my taste. However, I do can see the appeal to some folks, and I could get talked into this given the right set of players.

Probably the best tie-in game for a television show.  Extremely true to show's theme.  Nice mix of auction, economics, combat, and intrigue.  Good Euro/Ameritrash hybrid.  Combat is simple, but done very well.  Like how your wounds weaken your gladiator.

Pretty good game that captures the TV show very well (if you're into that sort of thing...), however, the arena combat system comes up lacking. I'm sure there is a variant to be made that would push this game up to an 8 or more.

RATING: 5
Great game where the main mechanic is wheeling and dealing against your opponents. Combat exists, and the HP mechanic in it is good, but there are some complaints here.

CONS: Gladiators and House abilities are out of balance. Game was designed a bit too much on theme in this area. Combat causes game to become a standstill, and should have been simplified to accelerate overall game mechanics (i.e.: focus should have been more on the Intrigue Phase and the repercussions of it leading to the Arena, instead of everything circling the Arena - which is only fun for the players actively fighting).

Still, a worthwhile game that should be sampled at the minimum.

I had a lot of fun when I first played this game at gencon but I didn't buy it and I don't regret that. Theirs just so much backstabbing in the game and you have to have the right group to play with. and then you have to deal with the fact that you could randomly not be able to meet you houses objectives due to purely your opponents just taking the best stuff, leading to you doing the same and everyone accidentally hurting everyone elses strategy, which can lead to people doing so on purpose in this game. 
It's like a 4 player prisoners dilemma in most game but can sometime not be.

This is ameritrash at its finest. Bloody battles to the death, scheming against your opposition. If you want to make enemies within a game and you can handle still being friends afterwards, this is the best game your money can buy. Gritty, mean spiriting...bloody. Those are words that come to mind. You do three major things in this game: play scheme cards against opponents to cost them victory points, gladiators, or otherwise hurt their chances at victory; sell/trade/buy in a market place with closed fist auctions of gold; gladiator battles to the death in the arena. Now, there is a LOT more going on than that, and while it is a long and involving game, you'll never feel better about winning a game.

RATING: 7.5
There are certainly elements that many gamer will criticize like the jump on the leader with take that, the many counters to schemes, the simple not very 'agency' combat, the speed die exploit. 

Nevertheless this game appeals to me because it is fun with a certain group of players. I love the stories that the game creates too. There are certainly dramatic moments in the arena too every time. 

There's a lot of bidding in the game. One player didn't like bidding so he had a horrible time.

Acquiring many slaves might be an OP strategy. 

Essential variant : highest roll wins initiative. 
Optional variants : handicap matches for 'unbeatable' champions

Tried implementing variant to end the game only after the arena phase to combat sudden wins by using convert x amount of slaves, guards etc into influence. But this dragged the game for 1.5 more hours.

I enjoyed a few elements to this game. The Auction was great and so was the arena combat. Our first play through we started at 7 Influence which kept things moving well.

RATING: 6.5
Nice but repetitive during a play; it is not a game of combat only, on the contrary, the most part of the game is bidding at auctions or trading cards (for who love these mechanics); materials are very beautiful. 
There is a "scheme" card requiring 16 points to be played while the victory is usually obtained (apart from eventual ties) with 12 points, maybe is this an error?

Runs a bit long and the arena combat is a touch wonky, but look passed that and man alive this game is good. You have to love a game where you are screwing over your number one minute, and making a deal with then the next to screw over another.

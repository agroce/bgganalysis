+ Being able to play an entire game while holding a single deck of cards is a very cool concept that I hope someone else will also try to tackle.
- Not enough customization or strategic options to keep me looking forward to the next time of playing.

The best play-any-where game on the market with simple gameplay but depth & strategy beneath the gorgeous venire. 2 player games are excellent but with the new expansion 3 & 4 player rules make for an exhilarating plunge into the chaos that is dirigible duelling. A must buy!

I like Oddball. It's a nice little filler you can take anywhere with you. Since you do not need any table, you can play it while cueing, while waiting for someone, in a restaurant, in the plane etc... 

However, once you've played it a few dozens of times, it becomes repetitive and... a little boring.

Still beats waiting doing nothing.

RATING: 9
Fun game to play that doesn't require any surface. Plays much like a strategic version of top trumps, pick the highest number over three cards and try and out think your opponent. There is a lot more depth to it, but it's designed as a light 20 minutes card game and works really well for a filler or whilst waiting in a queue.

Original game is only 2 players but the expansion brings along 3 and 4 player versions of the rules - adds a lot of fun to the game playing with more people.

And I've gotta add that I love the art and universe that sits behind the game. I know it's not directly related to the quality of the game, but there's clearly been a lot of thought given to the world the characters in the game exist in.

Not pleased with the tin which doesn't fit all the cards in it nor the instruction booklet.  It holds 2 decks, of which the extras must go into the box.  For a small card game it takes up too much space on my shelf because of the improper fitting and sizing of the cards and storage items.

Nice short & fresh feeling filler. Unique in the sense that you play the game totally in your hands,  without needing tablespace.

----Preliminary thoughts----

I remember there was some card decks about submarines, cards, planes, etc. when I was young and you played them by choosing a card each and comparing one of its stats, chosen by the active player. This game is just like that, but with a couple of features more. Obviously, the player chose the bigger stat, and it is similar here.

The game this is very simple, and the strategy elements are ultra-light. 

I have not played it and I would love to do it, but I seriously doubt I would still be interested in this game after a few games.

Where it shines though is in the artistic part. The illustrations and the design are certainly great.

On the fence about this. It's a good idea for a game, it plays ok (but it's a bit clunky) but the overall execution, card layout, iconography and horrible manual can wreck your experience. 

There is a deckbuilding option, but it is severly limited and few cards for deckbuilding that were added to the base box are totally "meh". I don't see the point on deckbuilding in such environment. Maybe with more cards, but still, it's a grab and play game. Deckbuilding is a mistake for this kind of game.

I had to sell this game. It just wasn't good enough. The clunky rules, the clunky card design, and the clunky wording on the powers just meant it didn't fit into the "light filler to play on the sofa with my wife" niche that I wanted it for. I am sure some people will really get a kick out of it, though.

This really seems to be blind bidding plus lots of rules to hide the fact that it's blind bidding.  Plus luck.  The rulebook is clumsy, so I'm not 100% I played right, which is bad for a game that is supposed to be very fast and convenient.

It's cute that it can be played with no table space, but that is hardly a sufficient selling point.

I bought this game to play with my son while waiting around. It plays fine without a table but it seems that the Pendragon's (almost) always win regardless of who plays the faction. It supposedly has strategy of picking 1-3 cards but my son almost always goes cannons with three cards and added up they win. I try to go 1-3 cards but have a hard time beating him.

I am happy to have the game though, as it serves its purpose.

a real letdown for me. I backed on Kickstarter because I liked the concept and all, but when holding the game in hand it more or less felt like a dressed-up rock-paper-scissors. But one where the dress only was the look, not the feel - I don't feel the steampunky airship battles. It's idea of "outthinking the opponent" falls flat, because there is nothing there to base your outthinking on. The art is lovely, but the extra cards have different colors than the base game cards, which just rubs me the wrong way, too. And at the end of it, there just isn't enough game there.

Had a demo of this from the designer at UKGE14 and loved it. Pre-ordered on the spot and now can't wait to get hold of it. Simple yet elegant and devious rules.

Revised after delivery:

Oddball Aeronauts is a brilliant, fast paced card game for 2 players that takes about 15-20mins and doesn't need any flat surface available to play it, so is ideal for playing in waiting rooms, at airports, in gig lines, on a plane, on the bus - anywhere where a conventional card game would be tricky at best.

2 decks of cards are supplied, each a different warring faction in the struggle for the conquest for the skies. The first thing that really strikes you about the game is the artwork. It's just beautiful steampunk-feel sepia pictures of a rag-tag bunch of animal 'sky-pirates'. The design of the cards is also immensely clever as no detail is there just for show. Every bit of info on the card tells you something, but that in no way means the game is complicated and a quick read thru the well written and yet refreshingly brief rulebook, will have you playing in minutes.

The aim of the game is to make your opponent run out of cards (ie crew!). Anyone familiar with the old 'Top Trumps' mechanism for winning cards will be familiar with the basic mechanic here. You have a choice of 3 skills that each crew member can choose from - Sailing, Guns or Boarding. Each has a number, higher are better. However, the very clever thing about the game is that each skill has a 'support' number too. The two cards under your top card may be used to add their support number to your main number to bolster your overall bid value for the combat. Each player declares what skill they will be attacking or defending with, and then in a 'rock paper scissors' style, declare how many cards they will be using. 

Shrewd readers will have worked out already that just playing massive numbers of cards may not help you long term, as you will quickly learn that you will burn thru your deck much quicker and ultimately lose. More devious players will get the hang of the principle that sometimes a fight is worth losing to put your lower cards into a better position to win the NEXT battle.

Winning or losing each skirmish will result in different actions at the end. Some will allow the winner to recover discarded cards (which are held face-down at the bottom of the deck you are holding in your hand - see? no table), refloating their pool of crew, some will force the loser to discard their next cards in the pile, often scuppering carefully laid plans in the process.

The game is a brilliant 'push-your-luck' strategic trick taking game, and if that were the end of the gameplay, it would be a pretty decent fun card game. However, the cards also feature brilliant secondary mechanisms like certain crew members who can add stats to one of the skills, or force their opponent to only use a certain number of cards next turn, or use a particular skill. Their are magic abilities, and some crew members who can counter magic. And to top it all, each deck is seeded with a number of 'event' cards as well which may force certain conditions on the gameplay for that turn.

All in all, for a game in such a small package - OddBall Aeronauts packs a big punch. It's fast, fun, can be taken anywhere and is a bit of a bargain for its replayability.

There are rumours around that new faction decks may well be coming in the future as well and Maverick Muse are to be praised highly for an immensely enjoyable game.

Not needing a table is a good concept, but the game does not have enough meaningful decisions for me.

Can't remember what attracted me so much to the game originally.  Perhaps the idea of playing it anywhere, without a table.  In practice I didn't have enough interest and decision to sell.

Pilot pledge level of original Kickstarter campaign.

This game is by FAR the best travelgame I ve ever played and can think of.

If anyone has questions - feel free to ask.

I need to admit that you have to work a bit on both decks that they are almost balanced. Dot get me wrong ;) - may be they are^^ but we dont think so ;P 

Also if you want to play more and often you can really work on the deckbuilding aspect that game come with!

A very portable game you can play almost everywhere. You don't even need a table to play. Light rules. Light gameplay. It's good for a round or two every now and then.

Very portable, as it says on the box. 
Nice effort to add depth to this old and boring mechanic, but in the end it doesn't even feel like playing a game, but going through the motions: say a number; highest value wins.
Also the manual is poorly written.

To me its just an updated version of Top Trumps and therefore its just a game of luck.

Another game where the rest of the world is raving about it but I can't stand it, I must be missing something.

3-D war. Surprising depth. My wife will not like having to keep all these cards in her hand and being able to look through the whole deck throughout play will cause her brain to lock up.

Played it a couple of times with my son, and he liked Dragon Punch better. I liked this better. There is a fair amount of strategy and balance between playing lots of cards to try to insure a win, and holding back so you can keep more cards. 

My first impression is that the Tricks are too complex when they delve into Protecting cards, and Rigging cards (swapping with others in the queue). I feel like the game could even be simpler and more elegant, even though it's pretty stripped down as it is. My copy came with higher level cards for each faction, but I don't see them as being necessary. Maybe I'll try to add them in after I get more experience with the game. 

The Events are an interesting addition, but take away from the "hold everything in your hand" format that I like so much about the game. If an Event has to last until the next round, it helps to have a surface to lay it down on. 

All-in-all, I'm very glad to have this in my collection and am looking forward to playing it more often.

You can play it without a table. That is special enough but the game play is pretty good as well.

Nice little portable card game. Recieved trough KS.
Play very quick and you can play it everywhere. I just recieved it before i went on vacation and i played it on the plain with my daughter. Played around 20 games now and it still is fun and the decks are well balanced.
You do need a bit of luck with how the deck is stacked, but it plays so fast that it doesn't matter.

Quite simple once you get the hang of it and I LOVE the art. The strategy element is ont diminished by the luck of arranging cards or such. It has a good mix of brain burning decisions and no-brainers. I'd probably like it more after more plays.

Enjoyable enough, but definitely felt like it could have gone on forever. Needs some sort of end game timer or something for the normal game. Learning what all the characters can do seemed super key, but hard to pull off.

It is not as good with an odd number of players though since the monkey isn't as balansed.

This game is very brutal, tight, and punishing to new players. The hand management is difficult and forces tough decisions on players. You can also get killed and have to watch for a couple of turns, that's just how it is.

However, it emulates MOBA-style video games pretty damn well. Instead of having you manage moving tons of minions forward on automated paths, it abstracts much of the lane pushing while retaining a similar strategic feel. Combine this with amazing character asymmetry and a fantastic upgrade system and you have a very solid game.

The biggest issues with the game are that it can feel very much like a treadmill. That's a consequence of it emulating MOBAs, but I'm not sure the pacing is spot on and it can feel tedious at times.

Not flawless, but an amazing game once you have all the card clarifications memorized.  Highly tactical, luckless but with minimal uncertainty, with clean and streamlines gameplay.  Really, really good!

Fascinating and very true adaptation of MOBA-style-team-games, with ok quality, but borderline genius simplicity, good old easy-to-learn-but-hard-to-master-vibe and phenomenal player scalability up to 9 (!) players. I only hope for more characters.

Its a fun little game, mini's have good detail, artwork is well done.  Reason why I've rated it as such, is it will rarely get to my table.  My group prefers the ameritrash style roll'n'lol co-op type games over, pretty much anything else.  If I could play this solo, I would definitely increase the rating, and also play it more often.  It is a good game, just not a good fit for my group.

A fascinating no-luck, high-player count, fast-moving battle game that captures a surprising amount of a MOBA's tempo and tradeoffs. Punishing for newbs and a few tricky interactions, but the core rules systems are very approachable.

Very strategic and fun game, played it with 7 players so far. Poduct quality is pretty good, lovely artwork and the replayability seems endless. Every character feels and plays different, but is balanced at the same time. Only exception according to my group are the monkeys, which are a bit stronger than the rest. But we played the game just once, so we will see. Keeping the overview with lots of players is a challenge, but not really a problem.

RATING: 8
What a great system. Everyone's base stats are set from the start, with some level ups giving very minor boosts. Usually though, a level up just allows you to customise your moves to suit your playstyle and the circumstances. But I'm kinda getting ahead of myself.

Guards of Atlantis is a board game adaptation of the MOBA genre. There have been a few of them by now (euhm... Rum & Bones, LOAD, ELO Darkness and Guards itself come to mind) but this is the first one to approach it from the more strategic perspective. MOBA players will know it takes a lot of background information and self education to really get good at these games. Ward spots, knowing all hero skills and common builds, very specific tricks and tactics like stacking are just a few examples. I love this aspect of these games because it feels very rewarding. It's a mountain of small things to learn and becoming gradually more and more adept at them allows you to noticeably improve.

Guards fully embraces this aspect of the game. While you can just pick up and play the game, it really shines when everyone at the table knows the inns and outs of the game. Coordinating strikes to whittle down a tanky foe. Using your basic attack to sidestep a nasty blow and having your ally retaliate. Sabine. Just everything Sabine.

Great. Fantastic. In hindsight a pity the game didn't reach more funding and popular approval afterwards because. I. Want. More.

RATING: 4
It is like a moba.  Fight. Die. Level up. Try again.  Unlike a moba it crawls as the table argues about best strategy.  And death (while not player elimination) can cause you to miss 3/4 of a round.  

I see the charm.  It is true to the genre.  The problem is, the genre is better as a video game.  This doesn't improve on the genre at all.  The plus side is, in your downtime you could play an actual moba and have some fun.

Do not play this game with with an odd number of players, because then two players have to play the monkeys. The monkeys are simple characters with fewer cards and no interesting upgrade abilities and is therefore boring to play. They will eventually be crushed by the other races that can upgrade and have interesting mechanisms. 
I doubt whether to rate this game 6 or 7. I need to play it an additional time. Probably it is a fun game wit many people (6 or 8).

RATING: 8
I mostly gave up on computer gaming before MOBAs came up, so this boardgame was my introduction to this genre. While I'm obviously not able to tell how true this implementation is to the originals, I can say that this is a very well thought out conflict board game with a lot of ideas that are fresh, at least to me. Characters are very varied, and a lot more games are necessary to tell whether they are balanced. However, the quality of the base game and the smart streamlining throughout the design makes me trust the designer, so far.

RATING: 7
DISCLAIMER: I was a playtester for this game and even mentioned in the rulebook.

As of right now, I view this as the best MOBA-style skirmish game for Tabletop.  As someone who used to play computer MOBA games like DOTA2 and Heroes of the Storm, Guards of Atlantis manages to capture the many elements of these games into a digestible Tabletop format.  What was a major surprise to me is it manages to create this typical skirmish combat game without using a dice rolling mechanic.

While I find the game to be easy to teach, it is by no means an easy game to master or understand.  Learning the flow of the game is one thing, understanding what decisions to make (even at a basic level) is another beast to tame.

Guards of Atlantis is for a very particular tabletop player.  GoA is a game that demands your time to become good at it.  A game or two is barely scratching the surface of what GoA can offer.

For starters, each character has their own sets of abilities to play with alternative skills to play around with.  One of the key things in GoA is knowledge of what other characters can and cannot do.

Another major factor is the deterministic and lack of random elements.  Everything you do is under your control, so any kills gained on either team is strictly relies on the player's decisions, not a bad card draw or luck of the dice.

This is something that players of GoA needs to understand before diving in.  If you are a highly competitive player who likes an unforgiving game, this might be for you.  On the other hand, if you're the type that likes to chuck dice and do all sorts of crazy moves on your turn, pass this one as it might bore you with its methodical gameplay.

Played at game at Essen and soon loved it, it was fast, even with 6 people, easy to learn and still with the right tactic and strategic decisions to be made. The level up system is also very nice. At the moment you have 8/9 heroes plus 2 with the expansion which I highly recommend, so the variety seems ok. I have to play more, and will do soon hopefully, to see the replayability which, however, seems fine enough due to the different ability you can level up each time according to your team and enemy composition.

RATING: 4
The player count in this game is a mess. It's a 2 player game, maybe 4, 2 players per team.

Card play should be interesting, each card can be played to move a character, defend against an attack, or perform an ability. Unfortunately, all this actually results in is looking to see which has the highest number and playing the card for that.

Characters and abilities can be upgraded, each upgrade has multiple options. Unless playing with people intimately familiar with all the cards in this game be prepared for a lot of down-time.

The length of this game is also an issue. MOBA video games are relatively short, even lengthy matches last less than an hour. Here, a game can last well over the 120 minute listed play time, especially with AP prone players, or while playing with anyone not familiar with the cards for their heroes.

King making is also an issue, and there's a serious rich-get-richer element. 

I find the graphic design of the board itself to be alarmingly busy and rather ugly. The rest of the art and design is functional, not great, not terrible.

The more you play this game the more you will get out of it. Learning all of the characters strengths a weaknesses is paramount. Being aware of their card abilities is nearly as important, which means you're going to have to memorise an awful lot of information. Being able to build a quality team of complimentary heroes is a must because, mechanically, this is a very rock-paper-scissors game. There's usually a hero that easily counters another and because of this I don't think it's a game that can be played casually. Without spending the time necessary to really dig deep into how each character operates they can seem intolerably imbalanced. Unfortunately, "Guards of Atlantis" didn't engage me enough to justify pouring the time and effort into it to get that far.

RATING: 6
This game has some interesting ideas, but I'm not sure they add up to a good game.  Like a MOBA, there is a lot of upfront knowledge needed in order to make quality decisions, so the first few games of this are going to be kind of rough.  Also, like MOBA's, it's mostly about getting an advantage and then pushing it, which in real-time can be countered by superior micro.  In a turn-based game, it's going to be tough.  You are pretty limited by your few cards.  

I've spent thousands of hours playing League of Legends.  When it comes to games like this that evoke some of the same things as a video game, I'm usually left thinking I'd rather be playing the video game.  While the level up system is clever, the card play may not quite be interesting enough to keep my attention.  Come to think of it, we played this game 2v2.  I'm not super interested in 2v2 League of Legends, either.  I've kinda played that.  It's called Battlerite.  We stopped playing it really fast.  It's a lot more fun that this.

In our game, though we hadn't decided it ahead of time, we switched to the variant where you just take down 'towers' before I was even close to my ultimate.  We hadn't even seen how the game would play out once people had those, which could easily have swung the game into one team or the other's home base.  If the game wasn't worth playing for long enough to do that, I'm not sure it's worth playing again for me.

RATING: 7
As a longtime Dota 1 and Dota 2 player, I've always wanted to find a good MOBA boardgame.  Everything else I've seen looked too long and fiddly, but Guards of Atlantis has some striking advantages:
1) The minions are largely abstracted.  They don't attack, they take one hit to kill, and they give advantages for being near allied minions and penalties for being near enemy minions.  This beautifully captures the importance of positioning without wasting any time or rules.  
2) The game play is very smooth.  Each round, each player gets 5 cards and plays 4 of them as their actions.  The players simultaneously choose a card, then resolve actions in initiative order.  When you take damage from an enemy hero, you have to discard a card that has a high enough defense (thereby reducing your future actions).  If you can't defend, you die.  Then respawn in base next round.  Super simple, easy to teach.  The simplicity allows for the game to play up to 10 players (!!!) without getting insanely bogged down.
3) The leveling up is simple, yet satisfying.  Gold and XP are combined into a single currency that you earn by killing minions or enemy heroes (more gold is earned for killing higher level heroes).  The gold is spent between rounds to level up.  When you level up, you replace one of your existing action cards by choosing between two possible upgrades.  The upgrade you don't choose becomes and item that gives a permanent static bonus.  Again, super streamlined, but the upgrade choices allow you to build in different ways.

The game is won by pushing the wave of minions into the enemy base.  When the last minion from one team is killed, the wave pushes towards the losing team's base, then all of the minions spawn in the next zone.  Push the wave two to three times and they will reach the enemy base and you win.

Overall, the game does a great job of capturing the MOBA feel.  However, I did have some issues that have the potential to ruin the game for me:
1) There are no towers or other advantages to the defending team as they get close to their base.  So, there isn't the same sense of siege that occurs when you attack an enemy base in Dota.
2) There is the potential for the wave to push back and forth indefinitely.  There is an alternative rule that says you win after pushing the wave X number of times, but that is unsatisfying.
3) The way that a new wave of minions instantly spawns in the next zone makes for some weird strategies.  You have to anticipate the wave pushing and get in position to start killing minions in the next zone.  While there can be a lot of strategy here, it's not a strategy that exists in MOBAs.  So, I found that to kill my immersion a bit.  The game seemed too focused on killing minions instead of fighting enemy heroes.

I'll definitely be giving this a few more tries.  I have a group of DotA players that will be getting together for the International this summer, so I'm looking forward to playing with them.  Also, with 6+ players you can play with 2 lanes instead of 1, and I think that will feel even more like Dota.

tl;dr - I would probably rate this about a 7 if I liked arena games, which I don't :)

A mix of hand management and programmed actions, this is basically an arena combat game. It has some interesting mechanics including multiple actions per card, so if the action you wanted to do gets messed up, you have at least some chance to do something else. It also includes a level-up mechanic, in which killing enough foes gives you money to upgrade cards - you purchase one of two cards from several categories to improve your skills and the unpurchased one gives you a bonus in something else. The game works like a tug-of-war, so the more you push your opponents back, the more likely you are to win.

I have two issues with the game. First, the board is static - it might have been nice to have it made of several large tiles in order to give some variability in the arena set up. I've only played once and I don't honestly don't know if familiarity with the terrain would make a difference over repeated plays; certainly all of the information about where units will respawn is known to all players so one is able to anticipate to some degree. The second issue, and the more major one for me, is that the player characters don't stand out from among the different types of minions that much (to me, at least). I had difficulty distinguishing the characters from the minions. If they were a different colour, or noticeably taller, that would be very helpful (I suppose one could always paint them). 

My minor criticisms aside, the game is not bad for an arena combat and, if you like this genre, is probably worth trying. With the exception of Swashbuckler, though, I generally don't like this sort of game as a general rule, thus the reason for my low rating. I prefer it to Adrenaline. If I were to rate it without my personal preferences getting in the way, I'd probably give it about a 7.

Name and tagline are uninspiring (only DOTA and LoL players care its related to a MOBA and they are too busy playing their video games), but after watching the KS video my interest was piqued. They picked a bad time of year to run the KS, and I'm on BGG ever day, listen to a lot of gaming podcast and I hadn't heard about it till the campaign was half over.

The creators have something here but they need to demo it more, send out some prototype copies and get some reviews. 

I wouldn't back it till I heard some feedback, been burned on other "cool looking" kickstarters before.

Best board game I've played, more to it - the first one I have ever enjoyed more then twice. Now this out of the way - I'm definitely not the most experienced board game player (some 8-10 games I've tried). Never played MOBA as well. Still once you played 1-2 times, and get the hang of it - totally awesome. Practically endless combinations of team setups won't allow you to get bored for long time, we've now played something like 40 games and every setup means the tactics has to be adjusted. Requires you to think (if you have desire to win) or you can go headless (fun but unlikely to win :) ). I would also mention that if you like the roll-the-dice and pray for luck type of games - this game unlikely to bring satisfaction, the meaning of luck is quite minimal (I would say none, but just in case :) ), and this is a great thing about the game for me, because dices seems to have a tooth for me. I would definitely say that this is game is a must have for people who have somewhat constant group of players (4-6) that like tactical battles. You will have a lot of fun time, really a lot! Though our group have been created from scratch once we've tried this game :)  Now the boring stuff - I really like the miniatures, and the artwork on the cards, the board itself is pretty sturdy, and show no signs of wear. The only thing I can name as a "could-be-better" are the rules, the best thing is to start playing, and figuring everything as you go, then the mechanics are becoming transparent and understandable. All-in-all highly recommended!

Great Adaptation of a MOBA, never thought that it would be possible to implement it into a boardgame. The rules are not that complicated, but you got good strategic depth with unit movement and skill picking. The game itself is fast-paced, so there aren't any big downtimes. Discussing your strategy with your team is pretty important and I liked that pretty much.

RATING: 8
A very good game, the mechanics are straight forward. That being said, this is far from a "simple" game, the strategy involved contains a lot of subtle nuances that keeps me coming back for more! 

First things first, the a comment about the quality of the game itself. The miniatures included are "Okay", not great, but good enough. The card quality is good, though the player-mats could be thicker and the board larger as the miniatures barely fit within a hex.

I would recommend everyone try at least once. I say at least once, because your enjoyment will depend on who you play with, as well as your own personality, allow me to explain.

The major feature of this game is the fact that there is little to no randomness. What this means is that the expected results for every action can be reasonably calculated. Depending on the player and their personality, this lack of randomness may cause several reactions:

1. Makes the game exciting and invigorating as they welcome the challenge and enjoy exercising their mental faculties.
2) It can cause anxiety as analysis paralysis sets in. They begin to hyper analyze every move, which slows the game down for everyone. Causing games that should take anywhere from 45 to 90 minutes to drag on to 90 to 120 minutes.
3) They have difficulty understanding the game mechanics, causing routine mistakes which frustrates them and their teammates

Further, because there is little to no randomness, the "dice" cannot be blamed. Thus, every time a team loses, different reaction could occur depending on the type of players found within the game:

1) "I'm to blame for the loss". This reaction can drive players to either strive to get better (positive) or beat themselves up and give up on the game (negative).
2) "My teammates are to blame for the loss". This reaction can drive other players away from playing the game as no one enjoys playing with those types of players.
3) "The game is to blame for the loss" ("Hero X" is too powerful or "Hero Y" isn't powerful enough). This reaction can drive the player from either avoiding playing said Hero, or give up on the game entirely.

Additionally, like in video game MOBAs, each hero plays different, so a player may not wish to devout the time necessary to find heroes within Guards of Atlantis that fit their style. Thus giving up after 1-2 heroes fail be "enjoyable" for them.

That is why I recommend everyone try the game once. The game may not be for you, as your board game group may not enjoy this style of high strategy, but for those who enjoy strategy games and has at least 1-3 other friends who do as well, I'd absolutely recommend this game.

Tabletop MOBA--smile on face.  Team battle tactical skirmishes with asymmetric power/weakness heroes and minions in simultaneous reveal card driven action and combat--No dice!  Fresh mechanics. Non-contested open movement is a great idea that opens up all kinds of offensive possibilities and defensive vulnerabilities. This coin bought upgrade system is fun and obsessive for evolving strategy and capabilities.  The game does seem to support the higher player counts with less down time than I would expect--mostly.

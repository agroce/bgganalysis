A push your luck game that works well. This game is 5+ and it is particularly good for young children.

RATING: 5
Cooperative game with no interesting cooperative mechanics. The game plays exactly the same in one player and in several players, except in several players, there are many more voices, making it less fun.

There are many interesting decisions to be made (in the hardest variant). An interesting aspect is that you have to keep some of each food, because if you eat all of one type of food, you basically have additional Xs on the dice now. Thus, you sometimes have to re-roll even rolls where you can place all three cubes in a line, if they block a type of food which you don't have much left of. 

The ending is broken, as it is purely based on chance and there are no decisions to be made.

Technically, the game is done quite well, the graphics are nice.

Mmm! is exactly what it claims to be: a cooperative game for children, if children understand what «working together» for a common goal means.

Perhaps this can be the game to help them grasp the basics.

It's better than you think!  A kids co-op game where your mice staling food.  When you first start you wonder, "Where's the game?"  As Mmm! plays out, you realize the focus is team-work and risk assessment.  Another solid 2016 Kinderspiel nominee.

A children's co-op game.   It was painful to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The players take on the role of mice trying to eat a bunch of food from the kitchen before a cat arrives to chase them away. This is done by rolling dice, whose faces match a grid of food the players must eat. The dice must be placed carefully, as there are rules that dictate when the cat advances or doesn't advance. As is usual with dice games, there are options to push your luck for a better result and risk busting, or to play it safe, but risk being too slow at the task to beat the cat.

Serviceable if you're looking for a simple co-operative game, but oddly prone to AP for the weight of game, especially if you play with expert rules.

Piękna i prosta gra dla młodszych dzieci, kooperacja sprawia, że nawet dzieci, które mają problem z przegrywaniem chętnie zasiądą do gry. Rozgrywka jest szybka, obrazki cieszą oko, tematycznie również atrakcyjna, sprawdzi się najbardziej do gry z dziećmi 4-8 lat, dla dorosłych niekoniecznie będzie to najlepsza zabawa.

Absurdly fun die rolling/bingo game, where the players are assisting a mouse in lifting the contents of the pantry, before the cat finds them.  Fast, cute, very well produced, and more addictive than it has any right to be.  The difficult board, and challenging variant, are welcome additions.  A wonderful cooperative game to play with young children, and a nice solo game for adults.

I played this solo with the challenging variant which restricts placement into the same row or column. This is a finely tuned push-your-luck game that's interesting enough for adults to play. It's thoroughly Knizia.

Un  cooperativo infantil de Knizia bastante accesible y con varios niveles de dificultad, en la primera partida jugamos con el tablero fácil y conseguimos terminarlo sin problema.

Como muchos juegos del Doctor tiene mecánicas de exprime tu suerte y dados.

Great game to play with kids - dice, nice cute theme, simple mechanics. That said there is a hidden depth to it, sure at its core its basically a luck-fest, but knowing when to push your luck and when to hold off makes a surprisingly big difference. On the "difficult" side it definitely makes a difference as to whether you play randomly or strategically

This is a great cooperative dice game for families.  There's a decent amount of strategy here for the kids as they not only try to roll the dice to cover certain food pieces, but also in the timing of it.  Cover up too many too quick and you'll limit future moves and the cat will get you.  But if you don't move fast enough, the cat moves anyway.  Two sides of the board help you adjust difficulty as needed.  As always, I like chunky wooden custom dice, so that's another thing this game has going for it.

Hmm, ez meglepően egészen jó. Sőt, emellett még addiktív is. Az elején nagyon könnyűnek tűnik, dobáljuk a kockákat és gyakorlatilag bármi jó, jönnek folyamatosan az "ingyen" körök, amikor nem mozdul a macska, de a végefelé elég gyorsan lerohanhat minket, főleg ha aránytalan módon csak 1 típust hagytunk szabadon, és arra várunk. Kétségtelenül nagy a szerencse szerepe, de a döntési helyzetek elég komolyak ahhoz, hogy ne pusztán szerencsejáték legyen. A variánssal még érdekesebb, egyben kiváló egyszemélyes játék is.

This so-called children's game (age: 5+) is by Reiner Knizia and needs quite complex thinking for an 5+ game (no wonder it won the Austrian Game of the Year - Spiele Hit - award, no, not in the kids' games category, last year). Other [geeklist=145362]Knizia dice rollers[/geeklist] requiring this level of thinking are usually recommended for age 6+, 7+ or even 8+ (see [thing=40656]1[/thing], [thing=27613]2[/thing], [thing=141337]3[/thing]). This is a cooperative one which mixes some of the [thing=27613][/thing] (or even closer, [thing=26248][/thing]) ideas with the bare bones idea of his cooperative [thing=151310]Hobbit[/thing] [thing=140612]series[/thing], so in the end I made [geeklist=196880]another list about further dice games by Knizia[/geeklist] where it fits fine. 
This is a rather tense game for kids, as you have to fulfill at least one aim in each turn, otherwise you are one step closer to fail. Mix in some strong spatial aspect as well (you can only place all your dice in one row or column in a turn) and the game gets quite interesting for a kids' game - even if it's not really cooperative. I mean, it's just as cooperative as [thing=5770][/thing] is: it's a 1-player game where kids take turns rolling the dice but they make the decisions on where to place them together. I have actually played it a few times solo before I taught it to the kids; with them we had a nail-bitingly exciting game where, after a series of bad rolls, everything depended on our last (luckily, successful) roll. Maybe many adults would not like this endgame but with them it was a blast.

A co-op game pitched at families with young children. This is actually very well-designed for its intended audience. For a Knizia fan it's interesting to see him filter ideas from other games (namely his The Hobbit dice games) down to a very digestible package. 

If you're looking for a co-op to play with your children that involves actual decision making, it's tougher to do better than this. Very cute theme as well...

Highly addictive little game. We usually play on the advanced side for an adult challenge. We have also nicknamed this game "The Stinky Kitten Game". 

The game play is very simple. Roll the dice and whichever food symbols you roll, you will cover with a mouse chip. The board is a grid of segmented carrots, cheese, bread, cucumber and fish. Once you cover all spots on the board you win. 

The challenge is doing all this before the kitty gets to the kitchen. Each time you roll but do not manage to cover a full food item, the kitty moves.

Now that the genre "roll & write" seems to becoming a common expression this past few months, I can now see this design falls into the same bin, thankfully without the consumable feature of paper and pen.

I'm also tempted to give the game another label: "My first young family Co-op", as I can't think of a more accessible, inclusive and engaging example. In my eyes, this game does a few great things:
Obviously it is a die roller, but it eliminates the dull spectating. 

It lacks the toy factor, but makes up for this loss with dramatic turns of fortune, the threat of the cat getting in the larder and the close calls as the mice manage to get away with the room's contents.

I like this game as a possible intro to board games; I know some children who'd be into this. It's cute and easy enough, with a bit of a puzzle challenge aspect but it is collaborative. Wouldn't usually want to play, though.

It is pure luck but it could have some  slight mitigation. But my four year old loves it and I don't mind it. So it will be a keeper for now. Update pure random tries to have a push your luck element. Stays only because my 5 year old daughter loves it and it is better than hi ho cheerio.

Soloed it twice - easy and hard(er) side and found it pretty trivial. As co-ops go, this is just a puzzle that one could as well solo (as I did). There's probably a bit of balance needed between going for short term goals (finishing vegetable every turn) and long term goals (finishing the long vegetables), but I instinctively understood that and played on autopilot (won both times). 

I didn't try the game with the "one line" placement rule, but not sure I'd want to. Sure it's a harder puzzle, but it's still s puzzle. And there's zero dramaturgy and mostly kinda samey. Leo is a much more interesting and group engaging co-op for kids - I'm suprised Mmm! got nominated for Kinderspiel.

it works well, it seems to be very well balanced (it seems like you are going to win easily but in the end the cat is very very near the kitchen!) but probably there aren't very interesting decisions to take, hence the 6.5

Fantastic kids game, teaching them logic and probability.  Also good for adults with the tougher variants and side of the board.  This game is so amazingly balanced... we've played over a dozen times and almost every one comes down to the last few rolls, if not the actual final one.  The Good Doctor is truly the master of dice.

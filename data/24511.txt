RATING: 10
I've just played my 1st game of Catan. It was with 2 other noobs and an experienced Xbox Live player. The experienced guy and my 11 year old daughter were in the lead. I started to figure out the strategies and came from behind. Everyone was disappointed the game was over. I asked if they'd like to keep playing. My GF said "Let's play to 10." It's hard to get my GF to play a board game. There was so much laughter and strategy, we'll be playing this often.

See my comments on Settlers of Catan.  I just have not played the "simplified" rules, but why would you want to when there is so little difference.  Picked the game up for the "locked in" board pieces.  4th Edition of Settlers does away with the niftyness of this version.  Still would be good to get newbies in to Eurogaming with a great game.

Picked it up as a tool for teaching new-to-the-hobby players, but never put it to use.  The original is easy enough.  We started a game of this once on vacation in MD, but aborted it in favor of Tsuro.  After loaning it to Huy for a few months I sold it at the Strategicon auction (February 2016).

RATING: 9
This can be used as a standard Catan game. Giving up some small variety of board positions for a much nicer aesthetic. In that case, it rates a 9. It can also be used to do a simpler version of Settlers. (You could, of course, also do the same thing with another set ... you are just stripping out the rules). I have no idea how that works ... Settlers is easy enough for my daughter to start playing when she was six.

This comes with short play rules which don't use the largest army card, development cards, and 7 points for a win.  I feel this is a great way to teach new players.  Also, the game feels more like a normal board game to non-gamers because of the board that encompasses the island.  The best part about that is that the "Earthquakes of Catan" as I call them no longer destroy the island.  The game also includes "advanced rules" which are simply the normal rules that everyone is used to in the original base game.  This is a great choice for those who do not yet own the original for the reasons stated above.  Great job on this re-design!

A prettier, simpler, version of Catan. Great for the intended audience.

Plays the same as regular Catan, but set up is faster and plastic pieces are likely to hold younger players attention longer. This would make a great gift for newer gamers.

Pretty much the same rating as regular old Settlers, but I've got to dock this one a point for components and graphic design.  There's just something familiar about the original that changes when you change the components.  Game play wise, same thing though.

German quality Catan with English print cards!  I gave my previous Mayfair Catan away because it was ugly.  Simply Catan is beautiful! :)

RATING: 7
Purchased on Tanga for $32 after shipping, since I didn't already own standard Settlers.  I really like the look of this version.  It is much easier to set up, and much better looking.  The only (small) drawback is the hex strips instead of single hexes.  But I don't play enough for this to really matter.  Played one game with my wife using the 2p variant from Teuber.  I prefer the standard game, but the variant worked well.  Glad to have found a game that my wife likes playing.

Catan is great, and this is my preferred edition of it, but I'm at the point now where I don't enjoy it so much if it's not played at a brisk pace.  I have been occasionally tempted by Seafarers, but I think this may actually be all the Catan I need.

RATING: 9
It's just Catan in a compact box.  I've expanded my original Catan so much, I don't even know what pieces go with what any more!  So this is a nice one if you just want to sit and play a straightforward game of original Catan.  The cards seem flimsy, but the rest of the set is solid.  Not expandable is a bit of a problem, but, really, the original is basically enough!  I like the frame... no scooting hexes here.  (Playing time set as 30 minutes?!?  What are they playing to 4 vic pts.?!?!)

RATING: 7
Likes: I like the components alot better in this version. Overall production quality is a plus.

Dislike: Other than looks, not much different than the original Settlers of Catan and is only up to 4 players.

Overall, it's still a great game and looks even better in this version.

RATING: 6
Nice-looking version of Settlers with rules for simplified beginner game (goes to 7 points; doesn't use those extra cards with the soldier & whatnot).  Can still play full version of game with it also.

RATING: 8
My first Catan hard copy.  VERY pleased with the quality of the game components.  Cards, tiles, and box all have a linen finish and all seem very sturdy.

I made my co-players wash their hands before allowing them to touch the game pieces.

The theme of the board hints at medival design and the artwork, color and composition are brilliant.

A nice Catan intro type game. The strips shorten set-up time.. The plastic pieces are quite attractive, and the player-aids are easy to read. This makes a great gift to introduce non-gamers into the world of gaming.

Scaled-down version of Settlers of Catan, with impressive components.  The advanced game rules restore the game to the original Settlers.  Gamers will prefer the full version, and not the "simple" version.

Great game, cooler parts than the original.  Have an extra copy for trade.

I like the tile artwork better than the American Mayfair version and I like how the surrounding board "locks in" the tile strips.  I do prefer the Mayfair wooden bits (settlements, cities, roads), though. 

I really like how they tried to simplify the game.  Think of this as a gift to non-gamers.  They break the game into a limited version and an 'advanced' version.  (The advanced version is what most gamers have played.)

Think of this as a gift that you can give to borderline gamers.

RATING: 6.5
The board makes a nice frame around the hexes, which are in reversible strips, so they stay together and setup is quicker. The pieces are also neat 3D plastic shapes. There's a nice linen finish, and the player aid cards are printed right on the board.

I'm too happy with the regular Settlers of Catan to rate this very high. It is really [i]Catan Light[/i] and a good game for those who don't know how to play SoC yet and younger players.

RATING: 7
Initially a little disorienting with the different art and the German-style plastic components (seemingly modeled after the Catan 3D chest), I actually kind of liked playing with this set.  The smaller cards are a little annoying, but I like the frame that keeps everything in place.  I don't care too much that the hexes are in strips, it all works pretty well like this, a much easier setup than my old Settlers set.

I only like Catan at 3 or 4, will never again play it at 6 (fyi; for years a 6 player game killed catan for me).

I like the parts and the easier setup in Simply Catan. A quicker game to play (and use as a teaching tool). You can also play the full game, but without as much random boardgame setup.

Family-themed version with minor changes in board, bits, and a shorter 'basic' version of the game that's even faster to play and easier to explain. You can play regular Settlers with it as well. We got this version mostly for family as to introduce non-gamers to boardgames.

One of my kids got a more recent edition of Catan as a gift, but this edition is my favorite. It's well produced, and it tends to resist the madness of buying a pile of expansions. This is just the right amount of Catan.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The pretty version of Settlers - comes with fancy plastic molded pieces that add to the theme, but the board hexes are smaller than the original Settlers, so most expansions will not work with this set.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Uses the same box size as the original German version, and includes brighter graphics than the Mayfair edition. Components are thick cardboard and solid plastic. Includes rules for a simplified version for kids or those new to strategy games, and the tiles come in strips and fit inside a board frame with printed ports, for easy setup. Otherwise it's Catan, Jim, just as we know it.

Although not much different than the original Settlers game, I have to give Simply Catan credit for streamlined play which makes the game much more fun.  I'm actually willing to play this game again as long as the short play rules are used.

RATING: 7
Already own the regular version.  Bought this version to play with the kids and to have a nicer looking version to play with the gaming group.  It takes up less space on table than the normal version.  There are a number of minuses with this set: the cards are of better quality but are susceptible to static cling, the plastic pieces are not cheap plastic but just look a bit crappy (for lack of a better word), and you can't add the expansions in to easily (no seafarers).  If you already own Settler's I would not recommend this version unless you want to play with kids or non-gamers.  Mostly b/c if you want to play with gamers you will want to get the expansions eventually.  This was an auction purchase for $20 so even though I have the original plus expansions I don't think my $$ were wasted (play with kids).

All that being said.  If I want plain vanilla Settlers I break out this copy.  It is less fiddly with the setup and less time to break down.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Settlers of Catan with nicer board and cards, same game as Catan but the board isn't as random with preset grids, some like the quick set up and others might like the individual hexes. But I must admit the components are fairly neat, I still like the original best but this ones set up quicker and looks a little more polished.

Each successive "better" version of this game gets worse and worse.  The original game, back before it said anything about Kosmos on the box, was fine.  Streamlined graphics and pieces.  Then Mayfair came along and made the cards and hexes much less recognizable.  Harder to play the same game.  Finally, this game comes out with amorphous blobs of plastic representing, mu, squattier or rounder blobs.  On top of that, the sixes and eights aren't red anymore, making distinguishing the six from nine more difficult.  The little plastic globs just don't fit on the board well and, believe it or not, don't have as much heft as the little wooden sticks and such.  Poor execution.

If you like Catan, you would probably like this; the pieces are a little more detailed than the normal wooden ones.  It has the full Catan stuff, but also includes rules for a simplified version, excellent for playing with littler kids.  The only "downside" is the tiles are laid out in strips, which reduces some of the customization, but that's a minor thing, as there are still many possible combinations to enjoy.

This is a pretty good version of Catan to start with.  I picked it up on Tanga because I wanted a copy of Catan and the price was right.  It is VERY easy to set up and plays just like the original.  The hex tiles are connected in strips which limits the variations when setting up the board, but this is actually what makes it easier to set up and play quickly.

Just finished playing a 2 player game in which I went 13 turns without generating one  resource!  I still like the game, but I like to have a little more control over what's happening.  My son enjoyed crushing me for his first victory in Catan. Good times.

RATING: 6.5
It advertises as two-player version which, really is no different than playing regular Catan with no trading so, yeah, no point since we already have regular Catan and this box is the larger of the two. Also, busted rule book, we weren't even sure it was talking about the right edition of Catan...so odd. Having said that, it’s a pretty nicely done version and if space wasn't an issue I might have gone with this instead of my old copy.

"Settlers of Catan" for dummies TM is an excellent idea to enlarge the gaming community. I havent' tried it yet, but the idea itself deserves a full "9". I am waiting to see "Ticket to Ride" for dummies, maybe even "Magic the Gathering" for dummies (maybe this one has been tried already but not in the right way)!

ps: this may be looked as an ironic commment, it is not! I really believe this is a good way to enlarge the market!

I've only played a couple of times so far. If you get bad placement or bad rolls, can be very frustrating as you never get any resources to even trade away. I can see this being a great game with all good players and relatively even/fair rolling. Thinking about getting the Events cards for more even distribution and a little less luck.

This game plays exactly like "The Settlers of Catan".  I got it because I was not certain if my wife would enjoy Settlers and, when I found this game at a great discount at GenCon 08, it was the perfect opportunity to get the game for the family.  Since then, my wife has beaten my in half the games we played.

"simply" here refers to that fact that this edition has a set of basic rules intended to teach people the game. A good gesture, but the actual rules are not complex enough to warrant the "simple" version. The good news is that this is the full game, and the regular (non-"simple") rules are included. This edition has some rather nice 3-d components.

*Owned for school - two copies* I've had this one for a few years for school and finally pulled it out to teach to my class.  Quite a few kids (maybe 10 or so) were already familiar with Catan and its mechanics, so this was a hot title to play during our lunch game group.  This is a great looking game and I really like the quick set up and play time.  I'd pick up another copy in a heartbeat if it wasn't so darn expensive!

I don't have anything to compare to since I haven't played "original" Catan, but I can see where this is an excellent gateway game.  I don't often have large groups so not being able to expand isn't that big of a deal to me.  I also can't compare the "set" hexes of Simple Catan with the "mobile" hexes of the standard version.

The bits for this edition are outstanding.

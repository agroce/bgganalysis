Ganz tolles und einfaches Taktikspiel, bei dem es darum geht die Eimer der anderen abzuräumen. Ich kenne die Version aus der Brettspielwelt mit 15 Eimern pro Person und wollte mir diese kaufen, aber da gabs nur noch eine neue Version diesmal mit nur noch 10 Eimern. Ich hasse es sowieso Spiele wieder neu aufzulegen und umzugestallten, aber dann noch mit weniger Spielmaterial ? Das abräumen dürfte da wohl schneller gehen und das kann ich mir nicht schöner vorstellen. Schade eigentlich, aber deshalb kauf ich es mir in der Version nicht!

Decent cardgame in which you try to screw your neighbour. The pyramid of buckets is a great idea, but the drawing of the cards adds too much randomness. Also a little overpriced.

RATING: 7
This simple filler has surprised me with its staying power over the years.  It's fun to demolish other players' bucket pyramids while struggling to defend your own and there are possibilities for tactical card play that aren't immediately apparent.  We always play the variant that turn order is reversed if the number required is exactly matched.  It adds some interest.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It feels like there's no control but I liked it because I can always get my non-gamer friends to play it.  And there's a bit of nastiness to it as well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A silly card game but good fun. Needs 4+ players and should appeal to non-gamers. The mechanics are simple, play cards to try and have the highest pyramid of buckets before two players kick the bucket. The interesting part of the game is the end game, when players try to keep others in to stop others winning.

RATING: 7
One of the few German games you can play with a lot of players, but I was surprised to find how much more I enjoyed it with fewer.  Real rating: 3-5 players, 7; more than that, 5. [initial rating: 6] Okay, I played this today, 4-player, but with this variant: instead of "upping" a suit played into you to pass it along to the next player, you can match the total played into to reverse play direction.  So if, say, Scott plays 8 yellow to you, and you have 4, 4, 5 in yellow, you can play 9 (or 13) toward Aaron, or you can play 8 back and reverse the direction back to Scott.  Now Scott can lose a bucket or add to his 8 and play into Dennis.  This worked like a dream.  Playing this way ups my rating one full point.

RATING: 7
Another good filler. It is different from other fillers that you have to balance between protecting yourself and attacking others.

very tentative rating after one real-life play.  i need to screw around with it a bit more before it solidifies.  it certainly seems like a reasonable way to pass the time, but it's not quite as fun as i had hoped.  the lackluster cards and oversized box bring it down a notch for me as well.

Mostly a basic numbers game, with a slightly too large helping of luck and your fortunes determined by who you're sitting next to, but I love the way in which things change depending on how you built your pyramid of buckets at the beginning of the game.

A two stage card game where you build a card pyramid of coloured buckets with the idea of trying to avoid colours being knocked out and demolishing your pile.

The deck consists of various colours with variable values up to about 7-8. As a colour is laid (consisting of 1 or more same coloured cards), the value is announced. So the bid continues until someone decides not to continue or can't. Then the corresponding coloured bucket is removed from the pyramid and those relying on it above.

Its a game utterly dependant upon the colour and value of cards that you draw from the deck as the game progresses. You have little idea of what cards people hold so it is no more than a light hearted lottery. And one that I found deeply irritating.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This isn't a bad game by any stretch of the imagination, but there just doesn't seem to be much to it.  It has some really decent components (although the box seems a little big.)  There seems to be some strategy in how you play your cards and when to really pull out the big guns, but I just haven't figured that part out yet.  It's a decent game that we'll definitely play again, but I can't say that it's a must have for most gamers.  Although it is very easy to learn and teach which is a bonus.  After a couple games, I am a little concerned about the frequency of tie games.  4 games so far and all were ties.

After one play, was left feeling a bit "meh". The group didn't like how you were always hammering/getting hammered by the same person. Noticed a few interesting variants here on the Geek that might remedy that, so would like to get it back on the table and give it another chance.

----
After another play *with the "bounce-back" variant*, I have to say this is a lot more fun. Enjoyable lunch-hour game, and I like how it scales up to 6.

-----
This is getting a lot of replay over lunch...the 3-p game is surprisingly a lot of fun, especially since you're constantly interacting directly with both opponents (if you use the bounce variant).

A fun, light little game. Quite luck heavy, which is evened out a little in the older, 15-bucket each version. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Not as good as For Sale, but another good light game.  The best way to play is where if you match the previous person's Number & color, you reverse the turn back to them.

This game however is in a desperate need of a re-theme.  Also the artwork is pretty terrible.

Pleasant, but not a whole lot to the game.  When I had high cards I won, when I didn't, I didn't.  The most interesting decision was deciding which suit to lead with, but when you're doing well, you never get to decide.

Lighter fare, but pretty good.  I prefer the following variant -- if someone plays a number equal to yours, the direction of play immediately reverses and (WHAM!) it's your turn again.

BSW game, where you need to have a higher sum of numbered cards of a colour to beat the total sum of the player before you. If you can't beat that number, remove a bucket of that colour from your pyramid shaped pile, so hope that colour is at the top! Interesting enough to play occasionally without too much thought required!

RATING: 7
This is an interesting wee card game with an odd but clever scoring mechanism.  I think it may need lots of players, though, if it's to work properly; three players aren't really enough. I've since played this on BSW, with several players, and it works much better (rating goes up). BSW's rendition is quite good, by the way. It's also one of my niece's favourite games.

RATING: 3
The game works.. but due to the amount of cards you use over the course of the game, building your pyramid of buckets only matters for the first couple of rounds, after that, there's a lot of luck with the illusion of actually having more control than you do.  I like the buckets, hate the art.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A family game with a huge "take that" element.  For some reason, though, it doesn't really feel all that nasty.  Maybe because of the light-hearted theme, maybe because it plays quickly, I'm not sure.

RATING: 6
Ivanhoe without the special cards (which I guess is Attacke...haven't played it).  Arranging bucket pyramid gives an illusion of strategy - still a very random game.  Enjoy playing, but high randomness can make it seem pointless sometimes.

Interesting game of bluff and card management.  Fine filler, I especially like the bucket pyramid mechanism.  Slightly dull card play, though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Fun card game similar to Presidents.  Manage your hand so that you don't have to remove any buckets from your stack.  If you get stuck without a card to play, you have to remove a bucket from your stack.  Remove the wrong bucket and it might cause buckets it was supporting to fall also!  So, you might just decide to take minor hits to avoid a major structural loss.

Easy to play for anyone!

Hm, I'll upgrade the past statement. It really is a nice and quick game. Still not really up my alley.

BBG: "Average game, slightly boring, take it or leave it." So it gets a 5. 

Going to have to play this to qualify for the German boardgame championships. They tend to pick odd stuff for regional qualifications, it seems. Last year's games were so awful I decided not to participate. Café International, for one. What rubbish. Alles im Eimer is great in comparison.

RATING: 4.5
This game is a filler, and as such it is only average as it lacks a bit compared to other fillers. The gameplay is quite random because of the card draws; if you draw cards with a low value or no cards of a particular color, you are not going to win no matter what. That’s something I dislike even though it’s just a short filler. 

What I did like was how you create your own initial pyramid of buckets and how clever gameplay by other players (and/or sheer bad luck!) can force you to discard a lot of buckets! I thought the idea that the turn order reverses when you play an equal value of cards is neat. All in all I think it’s an average filler; I would much rather play For Sale or Ave Caesar or filler games like those which can also be played in 15 minutes, but I would still be willing to play The Bucket King once in a while.

4 or 5 plays... Tom Vassal's review seems right on this. Lots of choices, but overcome by luck.  Thus, lots of almost meaningless choices. A "training" game for kids? I'd rate it a 7 or higher to play with kids... Maybe a 5 with adults. I want it to work. Great idea, with so much potential... How to add a twist to make this less of a luckfest?  Maybe this is just fine as a family game... Sigh. Update: upon another play I think there is a little more strategy possible than I thought, but still not that much.  I actually had fun playing this with my fermented set of friends, but with 6 players (two pyramids must fall to end the game) it went a little long. And alas, Miss N. started calling this the Stupid Bucket Game. If I had kids though, I'd appreciate this game more.

A fun and easy game that is immediately accessible for everyone.  However, the game really shines when playing with people who enjoy the screwage factor.  Otherwise, the game is a little lacklustre.

Components: Humorous artwork. The newer, square version has better artwork and number fonts. The buckets are quality.

Experience: Light fun. There isn't much chance of planning too far ahead, but I enjoy trying to keep track of which colors others are deficient in, and planning my actions accordingly. Doesn't play very well with two.

Anybody who plays cards can play this, and the title and cardboard buckets suck everybody in.  Love the trash talk and funny animal sounds from any group that plays this.

This is a fun game that takes the standard Oh Hell game and tweaks it with some additional stratgy.  Instead of just trying to win hands you now have decisions to make.  It can pay to sacrafice hands so as to attack specific targets (buckets). It also plays fast.  The first time I played we played 7 games in a row.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game asks the age old question - do you like your buckets stacked open end up or open end down?  The artist's perspective clearly suggests it should be open end up, but a sane human would always stack the wider open end down.  I guess no one ever claimed that most artists were sane.  Oh, the game is fun, too.

Yet another quality light game from Stefan Dorra. Essentially it is Attacke, but with a better victory mechanic, which appears to inject more strategy into the play.  Players lead cards in a colour, and must up the bid or lose a bucket in that colour from their pyramid.  Other buckets may tumble as a result.  Fun game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Similar to Ivanhoe & Condottiere, both of which I enjoy.  They're all sort of like auction games, when you think about it, except with multiple non-exchangable currencies, which makes me think of Das Amulett.  Some think it's more like a ladder/climbing game like Tichu or Dalmuti, but it feels different to me, partly because you can't pass and partly because you get more cards as you play.

Why the heck didn't Rio Grande title this game

Very nice little filler game, where one has to "go with the bid" until the bucket falls. Construction of your tower of buckets is critical and interesting, but even if you try to be very skillful the luck of your cards will always be your downfall. Once the towers are constructed gameplay is very fast, as there is little decision making. If you don't expect a brainy trick-taking game this is something that can be enjoyed with almost any crowd.

[5 plays] A while back there was an episode of the Dice Tower where several different people chose lists of the Top 10 games they would recommend to new gamers.  Rick Thornquist's list caught my eye because 9 of the games on it were ones I knew and liked.  The 10th one was some game I'd never heard of, oddly titled "The Bucket King."  I thought I'd better check it out, and was that ever a good idea.  This strange but groovy game turned out to be lots of fun.  We always play with the variant rule that a tie reverses the direction of play.  The Bucket King is short and light, but strategic.  It's also good with more, but I like it best with three players.  We seem to have the earlier edition, where your pyramid has 15 buckets.  I think a 10-bucket pyramid would be totally inadequate.  I also like the artwork a zillion times better than on the newer edition.

* Played 20+ times.

OCT/09 - Quick, fun "trick-upping game". Not too much complexity to this game, but one of the better ones because of the stack of buckets which add a very strange and unique parallel game to the actual play of cards. Not mere novelty, it actually works to make the game quite a good one. It's a 8 for how often non-gamers are willing to play it -- not deep but it'll get played a lot. That's worth a lot right there. [o/s/trPangea]

AUG/14 - Still a fun 7 for me. Such a simple and potentially vengeful little game (no red cards in hand huh? >:) 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Lots of fun when played with a variant suggested to change the play direction when the attack value is matched by the defending player.  The pyramid setup is not as random and pointless as it seems at first.  Be careful of the way your hand devolves.  Playing mostly on BSW.

RATING: 7
The variant in which exactly matching the "bid" reverses the order of play is a must.

Less necessary, but highly recommended, is the requirement that you place all five colours on your bottom row of buckets. This might seem innocuous, but it makes your stack far more precarious. Since the fun in The Bucket King is watching huge catastrophes (and agonizing over how to avoid them), this greatly improves the game. It also shortens the length, which is a good thing given the randomness of the card draw.

Silly and enjoyable card game about animals kicking over buckets. Played the original version (15 buckets) with some friends... where we played a variant of last man standing...

I own the newer (10 buckets per player) version, and we usually play the shorter variant of stopping when 1 or 2 players are out.
Our weekly game group came up with a variant of making the appropriate animal noise when you lose a bucket!

Another very popular game in our lunchtime group too.

A game which contains more than a little luck to be sure, but which allows you to capitalize on that luck and really kick your neighbor's buckets.

Quick playing, though I don't really understand how to best structure my initial pyramid.  I think the theme (though completely pasted on) is really funny.  Once everyone realizes that it's just a bidding game involving thresholds (like Great Wall of China, Taj Mahal etc.) I think it clicks a little better.  I've read about the variant where you can attack to your left or right, and that sounds like it might be a little better.  Still, regardless of the thought you put into your initial placement, your cards are still all randomly drawn, so I don't see how it matters too much.  You just don't want to do anything stupid like putting all of your colors in one place.

RATING: 5
I think the nicest thing about the bucket king is that it fills a useful niche – almost mindless, but not so mindless as to be completely boring. Admittedly, this is damning with faint praise, but there are times when every gamer wants to play something with a group of friends without having to think too much about it. The Bucket King permits this without the endless tedium of take-that card games.

There is also some direct player interaction – if only with the players to your left and your right – without open warfare. A player usually doesn’t get cornered until many cooks have played into the pot, so to speak, so it’s rare to look at your neighbour and say “you bastard.” Oh, it happens, just not a lot.

Typically, the best choices come when you need to play more than one card in order to avoid losing several buckets from your pyramid. Playing multiple cards is bad because a lower hand size makes it harder to respond to future threats, but allowing multiple buckets to go is letting yourself leap toward final elimination. Of course, once you choose to play multiple cards, you tend to find yourself facing the same problem again shortly.

There is a variant where playing exactly the same total as the last player reverses the flow of play. This is kind of fun for the person playing the tie, and it changes the rhythm of the game a little, which is good. It does cause downtime at the upper range of the player scale, though, since you can go several turns without playing anything if there is a series of tie plays that don’t involve you. Over all, I think it’s a good variant, but use with caution if you have a full table.

Whimsical, light and fun.  Good as an apres-brain-burner game.  Also very good for families with small kids.  Very little instructions are needed.  Some minor addition skills required.  Very clever and fun.  Play this with the "You-choose-your-direction-of-attack" and "Matching-a-score-reverses-the-direction-of-play" rules for the most fun.

Don't ask why I enjoy this so much, because I don't really know.  Something about the way the bucket-knocking mechanic works, I think.

Set up a pyramid of colored buckets, then play colored cards to knock down your opponents buckets if they can't overtake the value of cards. Try to construct your pyramid base with strong cards in that color as a weak point can cause your set up to fall like a house of cards. Winner is the one with buckets remaining. Kind of fun, cute light game but wide distribution of numbered cards makes this a light game.

RATING: 6
This is a tongue-in-cheek trick-taking game made more fun with the use of thick tiles with which players construct pyramids and then play cards to attempt to knock them down. 

Each round ends when one player (or two players in a 5- to 6-person game) no longer has any 'buckets' left. That's when they others count how many buckets they have left--one point per bucket--and then everyone plays a set number of rounds to determine a winner. 

I've played it with two, but am sure it plays better with more people--not sure what the ideal number would be for either number of players or rounds. 

So far (December 2010) anything more than 3 or 4 rounds would seem like too many, for what this is. Obtained in trade, November, 2010. Sold, 12-31-12.

This was a 5 until I found out how much non-gaming friends enjoy its simple nature, especially when you add the rule that if you don't pick up before the next player, you play a card short for the rest of the round.

RATING: 6
A bit of downtime with assembling the bucket pyramid and I'm finding the persistent adding up element interferes with the pace (playing more than 1 card doesn't help). All this makes the game lose it's fun atmosphere and it overstays it's time on the table. From a competitive viewpoint, as you can only effectively attack the person to your left, if you notice that someone else is leading there is nothing you can do but hope that the "pain" gets passed along. It's partially fun to see the "domino" effect of the removed bucket, but I guess it is a certain mindset which have forced higher ratings of the game. Best with 4, avoiding the first eliminated twiddling their thumbs. Now played the smaller reissue which has better and less cards, less buckets to stack and includes the "anticlockwise" variant. So this version is less painful and more fun.

10 as a great filler/warmup game. Probably only an 8 if it was 'main course.' My only problem is the colors on the buckets.  The pig and bull colors are too similar.  (I am colorblind, but usually the German games do a good job of picking colors among which I can differentiate)
Good game for "non-gamers,"  it was a hit on NYE 2003.

Breezy fun that's perfect for a non-gaming group or an end of the day filler.

The bucket mechanism works great but be sure to explain to new players the importance of arranging them at the start!

Really nice, light game. It's great fun to play, plus the animals are cute. Don't believe those who say there is just luck needed here. 

hand-management, knowing when to retreat even if you have the color, knowing when to play against the leader, and when it's time to finish the loser is crucial to win the game. 

Don't play with too many people though to play it tactical, otherwise the luck increases dramatically :-)

Light game where you can choose your level of thinking. Take note of your opponents' layout and try and play offensively without opening yourself up against attacks.

We like the rule that if you forget to pick up immediately then you miss that card - creates some laughs and encourages quick play.

This is a fairly simple card game with a very unique scoring mechanism of losing possibly lode bearing parts of a bucket pyramid. My rating is for playing with two common house rules. The first being choosing the direction of the lead, and the second is a playing the same number reverses play order around the table. With those two rules this is a fun take-that game, it's best played in three hands, highest score wins.

RATING: 8
First heard this one mentioned on The Spiel.  It sounded kind of fun, so the next time I saw it I picked it up.  It is a lot of fun!  It's not a deep game and it plays fast enough that you'll go for two or three or more.
Each player starts with 12 cards with different strengths in 5 colors. You build a 15 bucket (3 each of 5 colors) pyramid. Players then play cards hoping to knock buckets out of the other players pyramids.  If you can't beat the current power, you lose a bucket.
The game goes until 1 or 2 players lose their whole pyramid, then the winner is the person with the most buckets left.
Easy to teach and a lot of fun!

Alles im Eimer -- Played once; three-player.  With three players, it seemed too difficult to counteract the luck of the draw.  I expect that play finds balance with more players, as one "attack" will be less likely to loop back to the attack's originator.  

In the two successive games we played, I couldn't determine how to structure my pyramid to suit my hand.  Nor could I see how to play my hand to protect my pyramid, or to attack my opponents' pyramids.  Do I play cards from a long suit offensively, or hold them in reserve for defense?  Of what use are low ranked cards when a maximum of three cards may be played at one time?

I couldn't grasp this game, but I got the impression that the fault was more with me than with the game.

Simple but not simplistic.  If I play again, I hope for that epiphanic moment where it "clicks".

Another great filler with lots of chaos and laughter. Reverse variant makes the game even more awesome. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Quick filler. Players build a pyramid using buckets of 5 different colours. They then use a hand of 12 cards (with colours and values that correspond to the buckets) to play up to 3 cards.

The player to their left then defends by putting out a hand of similar colour but of higher value.When a player has lost all buckets, the player with most buckets wins!

Bucket placement is crucial. There are bluffing aspects as well as minimal hand management. Good clean fun. Lots of yelling!

[Kosmos 'Alles im Eimer' 05 edition] {Animal; hand management, bluffing, player-elimination; optimal 4-6p} {basic rule 6, "choosing-direction-of-play" 6.5, "reverse-with-same-value" 6.5} Bucket King is a nice variant of traditional bidding games - not counting score of a trick but kicking buckets. So it is quite cheerful and confrontational; esp. when your buckets are kicked over or when you find the weakness of your opponents :)

It is quite luck dependent, esp. in late game because the bucket may not be related to the cards any more. However, the luck doesn't destroy the fun of the game. Skillful building one's bucket pyramid and card playing could balance the impact of bad card draw, esp. with either variant. Other than building the pyramid nicely, it's also important to play cards carefully. A player has to decide if he should give up or continue to play cards. Sometimes, a player has to lose bucket(s) intentionally and then counter-strike the opponent with the same colour.

The 2005 edition is cheaper and players faster than the old one because only 10 buckets are used. Actually, I think one has more control with fewer buckets and the game is more engaging.

[variants] Two variants are available but I prefer the selecting direction of play at the start of round the most because it makes the game more tactical.  The "direction reverse with same value" variant is also nice as it increases the excitement of the game. Players have to be aware that their attack may backfire.

This is a fun, fast paced filler game.  It's better in the middle of it's player range, to balance the down time and the amount of player interaction. 2004/06/30

Fun but silly.  Would certainly play it again, but not sure how many times after that.  Too much reliance on what cards you draw for my liking.  Although there was some tactics involved.

Fun, easy, and at times frustrating. I can't tell you how many times I have forgotten to draw a card at the end of my turn!

A nice little filler as long as you play with the reverse variant.  We also allow the first player of each "trick" to set the initial direction.

Interesting little game. One lost bucket can chain up to a LOT of buckets lost. We play that matching the number reverses the direction so you can hit people on each side of you.

The game appears to be all in how you stack your buckets, I didn't get the hang of it in the two hands we played, but I liked the overall play of the game enough to want to play it again.

Neat game and like the 'expanded' rule of reversing order if you match the value of cards played.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Only played 2-P so far.
While there's some strategy in setting up your buckets according to your opening hand, it is luck if you draw more cards to suit it & if your opponent has a completely opposite hand, it can result in a very quick game.
A reasonable (very) light filler.

Easy game, even my grandmother needed just a few rounds to understand it. Nonetheless its fun for a while... dont try to fill the evening with it, but I think thats not what this is for.
Con: The new edition could have more buckets

I don't usually like Take That! games, but this one intrigues me.  I like the bucket building mechanism, but your initial build is based off of the strengths and weaknesses based on your starting hand, so by the time you get halfway through the game, your entire hand has changed, and you're more or less left to the mercy of the draw.  I feel strangely attracted to the game, though.  It's weird, and fun to play.

Fun game, only played it with the variant rule that reverses play.  Plays very well with 6, which is welcome.  More screwage than your average euroish game.

very funny light ending game, but not so light as one would think at first...
I prefer the old version (3 buckets of each color over the new one with 2 buckets), which I own...

The buckets in the "in real life" version are kinda small.  Small amount of strategy, but pretty random.

Good clean & simple fun. Excellent filler and one to play non gamers. Don't forget to pick up.

Very light trick tacking game with a funny theme. I play with the variant where if you match the bid of the previous player, the playing order reverses.

Short to medium game with very simple mechanics.  One of my favorite games.  Best with reverse option.
Card playing with a pile of buckets.  Good player interaction and unexpected teamwork situations.

Rating assumes that the game is played with two common variants: (1) the direction of play (clockwise, counterclockwise) is chosen by the initiator of each round, and (2) the direction of play reverses (i.e., switches back to the previous player) when the card total is matched exactly.

Fun for all ages, baby.

Played a few times face-to-face, and several times on BSW. As often with Dorra's designs, this game is built on an interesting idea. This one works quite well and is enjoyable enough, but it remains a filler.

A great family game for my 7 and 10 year old, but it's a good game for anyone I think. Despite being a "kids' game", the strategy is deep and terrible enough that adults won't get board. (We play the rule from BSW, that if you exactly match your opponent's number, it sends it the other direction.)

Wow, what a great little game. Far more planning, hand management and strategy than it first appeared. A wonderful card game that's easy to teach, plays quickly and is wholly satisfying for its type of gameplay experience. The more I play Bucket King, the more I love it. More than meets the eye, as you have to manage your hand, your bucket pyramid and your opponents to succeed.

RATING: 6
Clever, but just a little too light for my tastes.  It's hard to play very strategically when the draws are completely random.   Also a bit too much chaos, for it to become one of my favorites.

After 2+ Plays: It was over pretty quick, which is the only thing that saved it from a lower rating.  Its just one of what seems like a million light fillers, and without something more to distinguish it, I don't feel the need to play it again.

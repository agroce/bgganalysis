Como todos los SCS con una gran multiplicidad de objetivos que convierten el juego en algo realmente divertido. En vez de tomar aeropuertos arresté a la reina Guillermina y me la llevé hacia las posiciones alemanas. No iba a ganar, pero me divertí un montón. En la siguiente partida ves la profundidad de juego, que es muy muy exigente para todos los jugadores. El alemán tiene que ganar en Rotterdamm y el holandés tiene que machacar a los paracaidistas en la Haya para tener alguna opción.

I think my rating will go up as I have a chance to play this more. However, my first playing as the Germans was very frustrating as it just seemed impossible to ever get any airfield supply heads on the ground through the Dutch AA fire. Obviously my strategy needs some work.

RATING: 3
Supposedly the gem of the SCS series, but not to my liking. Counter density hell, clutter and arbitrary/sterile strength points and combat(lets mash our stacks of strength points together as omniscient battle fields gods until one of us has more than the other). See my review of Stalingrad Pocket OR read a good book about the subject. Dated graphics, and the really surprising thing is that newer titles in the series still have this same look. I suspected that SCS was not for me after Stalingrad Pocket and this title confirms it.

Not a big fan of SCS, so please read a review of someone who is. My guess is that this title will appeal to old-school grognards.

Cool subject though.

Sold.

RATING: 7
Nice game about the airborne invasion of Holland. The order of battle is very detailed. I like this level of detail. I also like all the special rules about the Queen, the gold etc. that are included.
I do keep my score limited to a 7 because of the combat system. This results in units disappearing fast (through receiving hits) and I see my forces melt away very quickly, leaving few options after only a brief period of play. Though the Germans are always under pressure they seem to be able to hold their ground quite well, as they are quite strong in defense against the Dutch, that are not too strong offensively. And I do not feel this fully represents the true situation in May 1940.
Having said that, I still like this game because of the feeling of being under pressure all the time (on both sides) and because of the level of detail and the subject.

One of the more appealing SCS titles. Fast-playing, dramatic, low(er) counter density, not too many special rules - I much prefer this style of game to the much larger, more unwieldy Stalingrad Pocket or Ardennes. I sold my copy a while ago in my general liquidation of unsatisfactory SCS, TCS, and CWB titles from The Gamers, and I sort of regret it now. While I'm not a huge SCS fan, I have enjoyed some of the games (like The Mighty Endeavor), and Fallschiirmjaeger was one of the better ones.

RATING: 7
Rating based on 3-turn mini-scenario only. This looks like an interesting platoon-level game. I think I'll like the full game too. I have high hopes that the novel situation - paratroops, thin lines, lots of terrain, both sides holding out reinforcements - will make for some great gaming. Rating likely to rise when we try the Hague scenario. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
On first impression the map looks great. It depicts the area from Moerdijk to the capital Hague, with each hex being 1km across. The counters have standard NATO symbols but the color chosen for the Dutch troop counters will mystify you. The spectrum of light has so very many shades and colors within it. Yet, the designers chose for the Dutch army troops almost a similar color to that of the open terrain on the map. And Holland is mostly a flat land area. So, one can imagine that is easy to overlook a Dutch counter or forget a lone troop in a corner of the map. The other issue is in a specific sector of the rulebook itself; when one tries to implement the paradrop and air-landing mechanics of play. Taking in consideration that this is the most crucial element in the whole game, there is no example of play! After trial and error on landing zones, the game flows smoothly. It has tense moments for both players. Although the Dutch player watches his troops being decimated by an airborne invasion he has the power to thwart the German player's might and goals. The situation remains fluid on every game turn. Everything hangs on a thread till the last game turn.  It has an introductory scenario, one medium scale and the whole airborne attempt to capture Holland. Also, it includes some interesting political aspects in this endeavor: like the capture of Queen Wilhelmina or the Dutch government and possibly the Gold Reserves. An exciting wargame.  For more flavor try the 'what-if' situation:  “Assault on Rotterdam”, an extended scenario found in OSMagazine#1 published by MMP.

One of the better SCS entries, the situation is very interesting. As the Germans, you basically choose when and where you will enter the map. Unfortunately, the airdrop/airlanding rules are unclear and a bit goofy. This has since been cleared up by Dean Essig on the SCS forum at consimworld, but to me the clarifications don't make sense. 

For example, you can lose more transport points to AA and failed landing than you actually used. A single transport point (representing 4-6 aircraft) can attempt a landing, fail, attempt a second landing, fail, etc. etc. How can you lose 3 or 4 points when you only used one? I am told it's "abstracted" and not meant to be taken literally, but this game is at a platoon/company scale, so abstactions such as this one don't make sense.

Also, the amount of wristage for landing a pile of units borders on the obscene. I like the idea, but I think the airdrop/airlanding procedure could be refined and improved a lot. If that happens, this game could be the best entry in the series, surpassing even Mighty Endeavor.

RATING: 8.7
Looks like this may be my favorite SCS game.  A three-ring circus with action taking place between Moerdijk and Dordrecht, Rotterdam proper, and the Hague. It seems there is always something intensely interesting going on in one of the three sectors which develop on separate timetables.  The bombardment, barrage, anti-aircraft, and ship rules show how little complexity is required to incorporate realistic capabilities and tactics.

It's more fun to play the Germans, but both sides have their interesting moments.  More chrome than most SCS games.  Were the air drop and air landings rules a little more streamlined, this would rate higher.  Lots of rolls are needed to resolve each landing... and there are LOTS of landings. Why did I ever trade this away???

Very good: Operational - WWII - Easy/Medium

-One the most uniques theme ever!
-Great situation: the German Market Garden
-Tough for the German's to achieve all primary targets (like Market Garden was the plan a bit over ambitious)

This a really refreshing game with a unique theme.
Germans land Mai 1940 in Holland an need to secure bridges and highways (and capture the Dutch Queen!)to get the German Panzers to the political heart of the Netherlands.

I got an offer I could not refuse and was able to buy two other great games on my wishlist.

A "hit & run" german attack. Some interesting possiblities of counterattack by the Dutch.

Standard Combat Series by The Gamers is a good series.  A small operation on the Dutch side would be very well suit for the series rules.  The Gamers' game is quality in map, counters and even game box production.  This is the only one I don't have in the entire SCS.

Best of the SCS games... the excess mobility is reined in by the canals and rivers, and the extreme attacker-friendlyness is OK given the almost tactical scale.  Not sure about balance but tense and fun.  The muddiness of the airlanding rules is amazing to behold though.  Not to be played without pages of clarifications.

RATING: 9
An Axis bridge too far.  Given its similarity to Market Garden I'm surprised that this battle has not been simulated before.

My favourite of the SCS series. Lots of chrome (Dutch gold reserves, German seaplanes, etc.) but it doesn't slow down play.  A great deal of fun and very tense for both sides.

Even if you don't like the other games in the series, give this one a go.  You'd hardly know it uses the same system.

I'm not a huge fan of SCS, but my complaints against it are slight - mainly that it's easier to disengage than to engage, and the odd Rounding Rule.  FSJ looks like it should be an interesting situation, but it just doesn't grab me the right way for some reason.  The graphics look dated and barely function adequately; I especially question the decision to make /both/ sides' forces similar shades of blue.

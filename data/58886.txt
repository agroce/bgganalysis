Boy does this game drag on (and on, and on). The dice are way too swingy--kind of more than Settlers because it lacks a negotiation and trade element to mitigate it. And I really didn't like how almost all (3 or 4) of the 5 players fulfilled the win conditions and it was really just down to who had the most people for a tie breaker. Very anti-climactic and... time consuming for what it is.

Plus, the mechanics in general felt like they sat down and said "How weird can we make worker placement?" It was fiddly, not innovative. The fact that you are forced to attack somebody every round is also uncool to me.

A worker placement game with some nice features, like the "direct interaction" (aka attacking) and the clever dice buying mechanisms, and fun to play.

I am keeping an open mind about it, but after my first play I worry that the game might not have too many different routes to victories; that falling behind might be virtually impossible to recover from; and that too much might rely on the dice rolls especially on the last turn or two. Hope to be proved wrong on future plays!

Played the prototype on 2009-10-14 with four others, with the designer on-hand to teach the game and answer questions.

Finally!  A [i]thematic[/i] board game about ancient Egypt.

Each player has their own civ board and can direct his or her workers to various jobs: soldiers, merchants, quarry workers, priests, or farmers. Each round alternates dry and wet seasons, and you can only farm during wet season, though how much food players earn is variable (and priests help this by praying to the gods).

You don't have full control over worker deployment. Each round one player will roll four-sided dice, one for each job. Each player can in turn buy one die and deploy that many citizens to the job matching the die's colour. So for example, if I take the purple die showing 3, I deploy 3 workers to the (purple) temple.

Each round, soldiers are secretly split between defending and attacking, with the victim of an attack determined by simultaneous hidden selection. So it's possible to beat on a leader a bit and slow them down, but not so much that it'd be frustrating. (Besides, if you're in the lead, you'll want to put lots of citizens into defense. If you don't, it's your own lookout.)

The player interaction was very strong. You can't ignore what others are doing, and there's table talk where you can try to encourage where other players should direct their attacks. I enjoyed that aspect, though the women at the table didn't. The splitting of armies into attack and defense, and secretly choosing your target, is to me the freshest part of the game, very clever and a lot of fun.

The presentation even in prototype form is very evocative. I think this game could really be visually stunning if and when a publisher gives it some love.

I definitely liked the sum of its parts and look forward to playing it again, whether the prototype again or a published version.

There's nothing particularly wrong with this game, it just doesn't spark. Fairly dull action selection and somewhat repetitive from turn to turn. In my first game, it came down to a monument race which got tense at the end, but the rest of the game in the lead up to the last round was pretty sedate and snoozeworthy. I would rather not play again.

Solo played this nonsolo game to get a sense of the rules.

1-29-17: Played the 2 player version. The rules could use some clarifying/tightening. Concerned about the frequency of ties. Enjoyed the experience. Seems like the game could punish you for making early mistakes, which is fine in my book. Need to play it a few more times to get a better perspective on it.

RATING: 6
There are some cool mechanisms in this game, and it doesn't exactly fit into any one genre - it looks like an auction game, but what you're auctioning is the right to place workers.  But those workers can be messed with by opponents.  In reality, this is a race game; there is no mystery about what to do, it's just a matter of doing it the quickest.  Something about the game is just a bit unsatisfying.  I've played with 2, and with 5, and both numbers had the same experience at endgame - "Oh, is it over? Oh."  You could see it coming, as most of the time everyone is finishing close, but there's not much you can do to forestall the inevitable.  And with 2, I'm not convinced it doesn't have a runaway leader issue.  It's definitely the type of game where the rich get richer, and requires players to intercede to prevent this... but at the same time, if you are using resources to chip away at someone else's lead, you aren't going forward yourself.  Some may find this a compelling dilemma, but I don't.  Not a bad game by any means, but it just doesn't satisfy me.

Alba Longa is, I feel, a design which has published too late. Had the game appeared in 2003 or 2004 it would have wowed a lot of gamers, myself included. Now, I can only shake my head a little sadly and move it aside in favour of other titles. And not because the game is in some quantifyable way truly [i]bad[/i], but because it simply seems to be lacking with respect to the competition.

The game in itself is a dice-driven worker placement game: roll curiously shaped cylinders in four colours, pick one colour, and transfer that many meeples to the action area whose colour corresponds to that of the cylinder. Other players pick up the remaining cylinders, and a new 'dice' round starts, with the difference that it now costs money to throw the cylinders. A cute mechanism which works nicely. But unfortunately the actions thus enabled are very directly coupled to the victory conditions (a number of temples and meeples), thus requiring very little player creativity in order to start progressing towards the end of the game. The only meaningful and interesting diversion is provided by 'attacks' of one or more players on another, which causes loss of meeples and thus progression towards the finish line. In the more advanced versions of the game it is possible to turn the removed meeples into slaves, adding an additional bite to the proceedings. 

Apart from the clunky cylinders (why weren't ordinary d4s used??) there really isn't anything [i]wrong[/i] with Alba Longa. The game works quite well. It also offers a novelty in the simultaneous attacks on a victim: this is rarely seen in eurogames, and avoids the infamous issue of two dogs fighting over a bone, leaving the third dog in a position to steal the bone. But the 'growth engine' is so bland and so devoid of anything interesting, that I really do not feel engaged by the system at all. And that is a saddening thought. Usually designs are overcrowded and in need of a good pruning, but Alba Longa has been sterilised for too long, leaving but a shadow of what the game could have been. Really too bad.

Each player controls a city state and tries to be the first to have 16+ population and 10 monuments. A combination of dice selection, city management, and worker assignment (inside your own city), and is spiced up with the ingredient of city combat (soldiers and heroes)! Inside the box are three big variants – Assisi, A Job Well Done, and Spoils of War – which can be added and combined at your will and which add even more longevity to this game!

Four dice of different colors are rolled and then purchased/assigned one at a time. The color chosen determines whether workers are assigned as soldiers, merchants, quarry workers or priests. (And sometimes farmers.) Works very well with 5 players, with only modest downtime. 

The rules include 3 official variants. We initially surmised that for 5 players, it was best to use the "Job Well Done" and "Spoils of War" variants.

After a few more games, it's definite: the Spoils of War variant is nearly broken, rewarding those who attack the player in last place. Leave it out, at any player count. The Job Well Done variant is just fine, though... adds a couple little bonuses here and there. (I'd recommend leaving it out with just two players, though.)

2014-03-10 : Some clever mechanics, but piling on the leader is a bit too strong, thereby destroying all the clever play that made him leader in the first place. The game is too Ameritrash for a Eurogame and too Euro for an Ameritrash game and simply does not feel comfortable to me.

I like the idea of this game and the theme...worker placement with combat.

Given the theme, a simple point race without warfare it would be a failure, but by engaging the theme it separates itself from what makes worker placement popular - the lack of direct conflict.

Worker placement's sweet spot is in passive aggressive abstract conflict. As god as this seems it fails to capture the attention of the worker placement crowd.

2 games, neither of them finished, one due to time restrictions (Essen 2011), one because fellow players just hated it.  I would like to finish it at least once, but don't think that it will change my rating. It's just too distructive for my taste.. I don't have problems to bash the leader, but if there IS no leader, you might get attacked for no reason whatsoever (each player HAS to choose an enemy each round)

RATING: 6.2
Szabálymagyarázat közben tetszett az aránylag egyzerű, kockaválasztós, munkáslehelyezős mechanizmus, de menet közben nem állt össze az egész. Egyszerűen túl nagy súly a szerencsének a játék hosszához és sugallt mélységéhez képest. Erre jön még rá a láthatóan erőltetten bevezett harc, amit gondolom a szoliter jelleg csökkentése miatt hoztak be a játékba. Az egésszel az a fő baj, hogy mindenki azt fogja mindig ütni, akinek éppen a legkevesebb katonája van, mert másokban jó eséllyel úgyse tud kárt tenni. Ezt még nevezhetnénk akár tematikusnak is, de játék közben azt indukálja, hogy mindenki kötelezően rak pár katonát, és általában nem történik semmi. Ha meg valakinek rosszul jött ki a lépés és pont nem tud katonát tenni, akkor a többi játékos gyakorlatilag nullázza a körét.

Logikusnak tűnik az elejéna  munkásokat tolni, és a végén felhúzni a monumenteket, de ezzel módszerrel az nyer, aki jobban dobja a fehéreket az utolsó két körben.

RATING: N/A
As one of the publishers I am, first of all, heavily biased and therefore I shall not give a rating of this game. But I do want to give my appreciation to the game and to its author Graeme. Because in one way Alba Longa has a distinct Euro feel, with its looks and -for example- the meeple allocation or the constant imminent shortness of money. But Alba Longa brings back what so many Eurogames seem to have lost: theme, fun and (social) interactivity.
We had loads of fun with the game, be it with 2,3,4 or 5 players, everytime. The dice drafting mechanism, perhaps giving a little bit dry impression when reading the rules, really comes to life during the game, when considerations like shortness on money and/or meeples really are giving the dice drafting a new level of psychology.
And the attacking mechanism is big fun too: perhaps a little harsh on the first glance, but the author has softened things up by the sabotage rules.
This is not a game where trailing players do just relentlessly attack the leader.First, "the leader" is a big word in this game. Second, attacking massively does not help your city development, it stands just still at that moment. Third, the attack mechanism also brings all kind of psychological opportunities: "why attacking the leader when someone else is presumably doing that?" "I'd  better attack that someone who is breathing in my neck" "I'd better sneak out of the war, and appoint my meeples to other and better places". Fourth, when played with the Assisi variant, attacking each other makes you miss some great presents at Assisi.

A fine production and big fun when played.

I have only played one 4 player game. The combat pegs back the leader and the modest touch of luck with the dice prevent the game from getting too heavy. It is good to see such a well balanced euro game come from a first time designer. I understood the rules completely from the off which was refreshing. Nov 2011

*UPDATE* Played with 5 players which added to the play time, it took about 3 hours. All 5 of us built to 10 temples which made for an exciting game end. I still like the game but I can't see it having enough charm to get played ahead of other games of a similar length. Feb 2012

Pretty sure this game never received any love, as it's a nasty one with direct interaction in a euro-shell. Well, I like that aspect, as it's not the same old "multiplayer solitaire" stuff that most games of this kind follow.

The game itself works fine, even though it can get annoying to have 2 identical phases (except for the peasants). Feels like the dice rolling is the whole game, which is half-true only. I like the action system anyway, as everything fits together very well.

It's not a great game, but it isn't bad either. I can't even say why I see it this way, as everything seems fine. Maybe because I got the feeling that you do the same most of the time.

One play only, in which this absolutely bombed for all four players.

I was told we played a couple of rules wrong so it would be unfair to rate it, but I'm not sure how much difference they would have made.

The core mechanics (based on worker placement/VP point gathering core) are OK, and I enjoyed the interaction between the dice-driven role selection and money. However I found the early game dragged and with four turns to go we (accurately) predicted it would finish in a four-way tie so it was a case of each player trying to optimise the tie breaker conditions over those last four turns. Fun it was not.

I'll grant that with our rules misinterpretations corrected it may be a better game, but (after having had them explained later) I'm not not convinced. With so many similar games out there I don't think I'll be investing the time to find out.

This is a very solid 7. Might be an 8 with more plays. I played a 3 player game it played fast and was very enjoyable.

- I don't care much for the fighting mechanics, they fall flat in our group and in general are more annoying than clever. Their main purpose seems to be to attack the leader. I would rather have this done in some other way

- The worker allocation and flow of money/workers is very well designed, there are some interesting decisions and these aspects definitely made the game for me.

Average worker placement game with dice rolling to select actions. The dice are acceptable, as the active player selects out of 4 and the other players can buy one of the other dice. Rather simple and straigthforward. Likely to become repetitive in its optimisation logic. I definitely don't like the included solution to counter this, as it involves an action in which you attack a single other player.

This game "feels" too long with the game play being very repetitive. I am not convinced by the "war" action where the only players who benefit from it are those not involved in the battle - the attacker has lost actions that would have moved him closer to victory and the person attacked may lose actions, whereas the players not involved can continue building towards victory!
The run time can be shortened by reducing the victory conditions which would speed the game up - a good thing. Whether that would be sufficient to make the game more interesting is doubtful. The "war" issue needs a more fundamental change.

The dice-based worker allowance scheme is brilliant. 

Unfortunately, the game relies very heavily on continuous free direct attacking. Food and money are pretty easy to get, so the attacks seem to be the only critical obstacle slowing down your engine. So, if you leave out the attacking, there's not much game left.

Uses cylinders as dice, which is cumbersome. Proper D4s or D8s would be much more convenient.

Alba Longa era nel mio radar per qualche buon motivo: un gestionale non "solitario di gruppo", un po' di alea, la possibilità di giocare in cinque e una grafica abbastanza gradevole.
Provato allo Spiel, si è rivelato una mezza delusione. Il fattore fortuna che si rivela troppo determinante quando tocca a te tirare i dadi, la poca utilità ad attaccare gli avversari (se non quando ormai è troppo tardi) ma soprattutto le pochissime emozioni. Non fa per me.

My rating is based on playing the game using [b][u]all[/u][/b] of the 'variants'. I don't consider them to [i]be[/i] variants, I consider them essential and I'd like to highly recommend that people, especially first-timers, play the "full" game. Most of the complaints, being leveled against the game in the comments, are addressed by playing the game with all variants in effect.

Wouldn't have payed attention to this game, if I hadn't received it as a gift. However, Alba Longa is going to stay on my shelf because this particular mixture of well-known eurogame mechanisms strikes a chord with me.

You try to grow your city and build monuments at the same time. It might be a simple but solid implementation of worker placement, if it weren't for those horrendous wooden things they choose to call dice, and which will throw around all the meeples on your game board. Someone should inform them that d4 already exist.

one play at Ray's.  It was pretty good - but the rules were kind of tricky and it took us some time to get into the flow of things.  I liked the dice drafting - although the tube shape of the dice seemed like overkill when a regular 8 sided die would've worked easier.  

I like the combat mechanism as well.

Got the impression, although it's my first play, that players don't actually do lots of interesting things. We certainly have the ability to move cubes and meeples from place to place but I really need a map and some more positive interaction. Maybe playing the game with a variant suggested can improve the experience but then again I don't think it's the kind of game I like the most.

First impression after an incomplete game: Worker placement game with a very limited set of actions to select. You have to manage three ressources: Workers, money and food. For me, it felt repetitive after one "year". You can think a lot about the distribution of your workers but I prefer games with more options. Maybe I like breadth instead of depth.

Early Italy, 600 BCE – Five city states are vying each other for superiority in the region: Roma with their Roman inhabitants, Velletri with the Volscian inhabitants, Reate with their Sabin inhabitants, Veii with their Etruscian inhabitants, and Alba Longa with their Latin inhabitans. Each player controls a city state and tries to be the first to have 16+ population and 10 monuments. This city state is destined to be a glorious power of the Ancient World!

A game of Alba Longa offers a fine combination of dice selection, city management, and worker assignment (inside your own city), and is spiced up with the ingredient of city combat (soldiers and heroes)! Inside the box are three big variants – Assisi, A Job Well Done, and Spoils of War – which can be added and combined at your will and which add even more longevity to this game!

Far, far too long for what it is - the dice-rolling mechanism is a nice idea, but in practice it takes forever and the results are just not interesting enough to justify the time. It doesn't help that the engine-building aspects are simple and dull. Even less does it help that in the standard game, warfare is usually a losing proposition (unless you gang up on someone, the target loses the use of fewer workers than you do).

The variants appear to address some of this, but I have no patience with people who move crucial bits of the game into variants. They're not even listed as an advanced game - if they were, we might have used them.

Sadly less interesting than it first appeared. I totally dug the ability to gang up on players and the simple worker allocation (via those nifty cylindrical dice), but in the end it was overlong, repetitive, and full of choices that initially look interesting but turn out to not be so. Passing the first player card to whoever you wanted *sounds* interesting, but in practice it was almost always given to whoever benefited least.

It's too bad, this game seemed to have a lot going for it.

RATING: N/A
Way too long for the weight and interest value of the limited/railroaded decisions made,  and HEAVY push-to-center (AKA catch-ups and lack of real equity changes or un-obvious plays netting advantage) mean that it seems like the game will end on the same turn for everyone or almost everyone, and then be resolved by the second tiebreaker-  definitely makes for an unappealing endgame for me.

Perhaps a second play with the variant options will change my opinion (though it seems unlikely).  I'll avoid rating it until then.

(after 1 3p learning game)  We missed a few of the subtle things and the end game trigger point (end of entire year) threw my opponents - BUT I still enjoyed it.  I would want to play much faster next game AND it appears that the variants add a lot.   Rating could up.

It is a rather simple worker placement game. When you start to play it you think that the military will gain the victory but it's not. Definitely better with a lot of players. I think that it was not necessary to last 10 rounds with less than 4 players.

This might be the perfect family game for more advanced players. Easy to explain and understand. Easy to play, but there are a lot of possibilities. If I do that now, that won’t work for me, but it will work for Y., and I don’t want to give him that big an advantage, so I’ll have to play it, but I really want to play that, because…. Well, you understand me. A lot of possible and interesting choices, but not too deep. As easy as Le Havre, but with less possible tactics. Because of this, it won’t become a top 100 game, but still a very nice game to play every now and then.

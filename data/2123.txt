This is actually a very good translation of the RPG into a CCG. It's a little long for what it is, but still pretty good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Solid card game with solid mechanics.  Was prematurely taken off the market with only one expansion released.  If it had a lot more runs and runners it would have been so much better!

This isn't a boardgame, so I'm surpised to see it on the list. I've owned the second and third editions of the game, and want to buy the newest, fourth edition, but probably won't.

Absolutely love the universe, but the game is a lot like Star Trek CCG. Which I don't love quite so much.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I played this a lot when it first came out.  Still have my main character (street shaman, naturally!) who did something really stupid in the last game, escaped with his life and has been in retirement ever since.

Translation: I never play RPGs anymore.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
My collection consists of a couple of Limited Edition tuned up starter decks and a handful of boosters (all opened and lightly played.)240 total cards along with starter boxes, two rule books and 2 info reference cards. Make an offer!

RATING: 3
Captures the flavour of the SR universe well, but the game mechanics never grabbed me. This is one of the rare CCGs that was actually intended for more than 2 players at a time, and it only really functioned well with that higher scale. The problem, of course, is that this game never caught on, so getting more than one other person to play it with you was always difficult.

I think the game also suffers because of the rarity situation, where the high difficulty obstacles (I'm not sure that's what they're actually called, the cards you put on locations to slow down the opponents) are very, very good and hard to hack, while the more common ones are generally a breeze. I honestly feel that you have to have a large stack of the higher quality obstacles to make the game all that interesting or challenging, and if one person has a number of the better ones, and you could never pull any of those yourself, well, good luck chummer. (I'm still haunted by visions of my primary opponent's Chomps 2000 Guard Dog obstacle...)

I will say that the art and overall flavour of the game is spot on, but the issues noted above kept me from ever getting as much mileage out of this as I would have liked. At this point, I actually think it would be easier to get a Shadowrun RPG campaign going again than to get this back onto the table, which is probably for the best. Also, to be quite frank, Netrunner accomplishes everything this is trying to but in a much more clean and effective fashion. If you want a cyberpunk CCG, that game is definitely the one to pick up.

I remember the hype in my local gamestore when this first came out.  That's pretty much all it was - hype.  Again, the waste of a potentially good license.

RATING: 5
I would rate this game higher, except I got into it when it was already "dead", sadly.  One of the better CCGs ever made, and certainly better than the very similar cyberpunk offering "NetRunner." Like many CCGs, though, the collectable aspect only hurts its overall playability.  Could have been a solid, set, stand-alone title.

Acquired cheaply, and with the idea of making decks for several individuals to play.  As with most CCGs, that concept was better in my head than in practice.

I am sitting on cards I may never use now.  At least they were cheap.

This is the Shadowrun CCG.  I still have a great collection of the cards, and I still play with my NC friends on occasion.  I think this game was a bit underdeveloped, but it's a light and fun gem from a genre I just don't have represented otherwise in my collection.

I have a miscellaneous pile of cards which are still to be sorted, however, I DO have a whole box of Underworld Booster packs.  These packs were all opened just to check each card, and I never got around to distributing them to various decks, therefore their condition is good

427 cards plus the full box of Underworld Boosters

A fun CCG based on the RPG of the same name, I really enjoyed the way each team existed separate of each other and there was no direct competition between teams except in emergencies.  If this game had just survived...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I love the theme and the mechanisms represent the RPG very closely. However, severe balance issues made it too easy to create a team that found no resistance from the runs. That broke it for me.

RATING: 1
This game being collectible means the gameplay is fundamentally broken.  The process of figuring out what combinations are better is a puzzle not a game.  Sitting by yourself constructing a deck is the definition of solitary play (a puzzle).

Beyond that the business model of collectible games is deplorable.  It is a form of gambling targeted towards children.  It adds no benefit to the gameplay is done specifically to milk as much money from people as possible.

This card game is meant really for only those who like the RPG.  I blame its short life on the fact that it is easy to make your runners so powerful that nothing is able to stop them and play becomes irrelevant.

My best friend and I basically own 4-8 of every card from the base set, only expansion, and special german release cards.  We play a customized draft each time we play that erases some of the flaws of this short-lived game and turn it into one of my all-time favorite card games.

This is a fun game, but the card selection available limits deck building options somewhat.  It could've used one more expansion before dying off.

The "challenges" from Duel of Ages seem to have borrowed their basic idea from this game, without bringing across the complexity.  A real sense of tension can develop as players attempt to pass up t0 three challenges on the way to obtaining an objective.

RATING: 6
[BGCOLOR=#A0A0FF][COLOR=#FFFFFF]xxG.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] An okay game, doesn't stand out.

Update: played a couple games so far as part of my CCG Journey (check my geeklist). Better than I remember - there's definitely a little learning curve in terms of money and card management, especially with maintaining effective challenges on objectives. I suspect this is better multiplayer than 2p, but we'll see (soon, I hope).

If this was a living card game, I would play it all the time. There is great strategy on multiple levels, and every single card is unique and interesting. 

An out-of-print CCG? Good luck finding opponents :(

Not very innovative , too many choices(bloat), Challenge deck requires a lot of rares to be effective. Feels like a weaker version of Netrunner. Netrunner allows for multiple objectives whereas Shadowrun allows for only 1.

Shadowrun was one of the better 2nd-wave CCGs. It is fun sending out your runners while fending off your opponent. Enjoyable game that feels a bit like roleplaying.

rated after two plays. I found the game quite abstract, but strangely after two times I do not see any strategy in the game except for trying to make you final hands full of good enough final cards. The is interaction probably among players but I do not see that and even the points given by some cards are difficult to understand with respect the others. Maybe there is a strategy beyond this game but it is not evident at all and I do not have the time to search it. Very nice component and graphical aspect

This one's a beautiful, well-balanced visual puzzle. Low cards get your cubes out easier, but high cards score the points. But you need the cubes for final cards!! Not fiddly at all, and seems quite replayable. Very fast though; it's over in the blink of an eye!

This game looks and plays somewhat like an abstract, but it jumps up one level to embrace the theme and convey a sense of context. You're moving matter and planets around orbital paths, colliding with each other to gather resources which are spent to play cards from your hand. These cards evolve planets and change their properties.

It's actually a very simple, direct game. You may be wondering where the depth is upon the explanation. In play, the swirling chaos and battle over control is gripping and endearing. Great game for its time commitment. Only downside is that it can be fairly brain burning if you let it get that way. I prefer more snappy, gut instinct play.

RATING: 7.9
Initial impression after 2 solo games: This game is not as easy as its components would make you think. I lost both solos by quite a long shot, mainly, but not exclusively, due to unfortunate rolls (solo plays against dice which determine advance states). As a shoot-from-the-hip learner, I’ll enjoy experimenting and figuring out the best strategies for scoring more points, more often, possibly even having to plan for multiple Final Evolution plays at the end, instead of only one.

I’m looking forward to trying this on 3p group to see if it’s any harder or easier.

Love the great artwork and production quality.

~

Impression after first 3p game: Lots of ways to intentionally and unintentionally mess with another player’s plans. We played open handed talking through our thinking and moves since we were all learning, so there were no real surprises. 

80+yo complained that there were too many rules, but only because I was doling them out to him as needed so he wouldn’t feel overwhelmed. 

Other 40+yo player, prone to a bit of AP, remarked it was a good thinker for her, especially at the end stages, to work out how to maximize points from what she had in hand.

Perhaps because it was a first game, and playing with non-gamers, and having one AP player, the game lasted at least 90 min, probably a bit longer.

This looks a bit lighter than I originally thought, with not as many interesting decisions.  Seems like it could be in the gateway game category, geared more towards learning how the galaxy formed.

(Component-only review for now.) Illustrations are high quality though the subject material is a bit dry. Color choices could've been more functional. Graphic design is good and fits the theme well. Component quality is spotty.

The board is huge and of good quality. The box wrap is nice and glossy and the box telescopes perfectly. The insert is a nice, rich black, but especially flimsy; I'd be surprised if many of them aren't torn during delivery. For the Kickstarter version, the standee planet tokens are too thin and will bend at the base at the first opportunity, so they must be disassembled when packing the game away. Meh.

But overall, it's inexcusable that a card-driven game that raised $126k on Kickstarter has card quality comparable to a flimsy GameCrafter game. It's unbelievable that the cardstock wasn't upgraded to 300gsm; the cards are nearly guaranteed to bend at the first accidental flub. Too bad.

From the rules, it seems like the game will be decent (I expect low 7-ish). But overall, the game wasn't given a modern quality treatment (especially for a campaign that raised $126k!) and it feels like another Game Salute money grab. Caveat emptor.

RATING: 7.25
Planetarium is an interesting thematic resource collection game, which simultaneously is reminiscent of abstracts in terms of movement.
Players make resources impact with planets, either by moving the matter tokens onto them, or by moving the planets through the matter (meteor collisions), while all are orbiting the sun at several distances.
Both resources collected and orbital position/planetary type determine how players can spend planetary resource collected- this is somewhat reminiscent of 2016's Terraforming Mars.
But planetary location also sets up additional resources available and eventually end-game scoring conditions, which makes it feel a bit like abstracts like DVONN or TZAAR.
I'm very much looking forward to trying this at several player counts to see how it plays differently- at four I think it's perhaps a bit random from turn to turn, but I plan to reassess with additional play.

KickStarter edition with sci-fi pack.

I am really impressed with Planetarium after my first two games. There is a little more strategy than I first expected. Working your way to your final evolution cards is a lot of fun. Other players will move your goal planets out of orbit or will flip them habitable to Hostile or vice versa. Then it is a decision of whether to reverse their actions or shoot for new final evolution cards. We love watching and creating the evolution of each planet. It creates a neat story at the end if you like to get creative with your games. A solid game for new gamers with enough depth to keep veterans happy. Plays in under an hour, 30 to 40 with 2 players, so it doesn't require any time commitments.

One of my more unique games.  Great theme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The game board is composed of seven rings around a central sun. Every ring consists of numerous nodes that are populated randomly with 4 kinds of matter at the beginning of the game - gas, rock, water, and metal. The four planets, two rocky and two gaseous, have set starting locations. Players have a hand of planetary evolution cards of three kinds (low [easy], high [hard], and final [end game]). When a card is played, a new card can be drawn from any deck.

All planets and matter move clockwise around the board. On a turn a player can move a matter token or a planet. Planets move one node if jumping rings or can move along one ring until it hits a piece of matter. Matter moves one node or two nodes when a certain late game trigger is hit. When matter collides with a planet, the matter token is saved on that player's planet board associated with the same planet. Sets of matter on a planet that meet an evolution card's requirements can be exchanged to play a card to that planet, which can influence a planet's traits - namely making it more or less habitable. Final evolution cards are played on each player's last turn on planets which meet requirements such as being habitable or not, existing on a certain ring, being rocky or gaseous, and/or having stored additional metals. Every card played gives you points and most points wins.

The art on the cards is pretty phenomenal. The text is educational. The game play is tricky as you shape your choices to meet your final evolution goals and players may have different plans for the same planet, creating a push and pull of influences. This is a solid light/medium weight game that engages on multiple levels. The base game is all hard science, but there is an additional Sci-Fi deck that mixes in a bit of fantasy as you can create Vulcan or Planet X or use a terraforming Beam to wipe out all prior influences on a planet's evolution. I really enjoyed this one. I suspect it is best with 2 or 3 players. The more players, the more the board changes between turns, making it harder for meaningful planning to take place.

Only played once, will play and update this.

It is a pretty simple tableau building game. There is no engine.

My opponent (roommate) decided to employ a strategy after he realized he was too behind to pretty much move just to disrupt my strategy and take resources.
I am curious and will try to play with the players sharing the resources on a planet (it seems to gamey to have separate resource pools). 

The points system works but seems pretty much tacked on just to make it more of a game. I'll have to look at the design notes.

Firstly, as an admitted space geek, I love the theme of this game.  Essentially you are building a solar system.

In a sense it's more of a puzzle game, moving around the planetoids and elements around the star, so that you can collide with the resources you need to gather for that planet, to be able to play the trait cards you want to add to that planet.  It's easy to learn though and matches don't take too long.  Experienced players could probably finish in 30-45 minutes.  Matches with new players might take 40-60 minutes.  It's the type of game were you only need to play it once to learn it and so it a good game to share with family or friends that are new to board gaming or don't enjoy complex board games.  It also has the potential to be a gateway game, to get people interested on other games, should they enjoy this one.

This game is one of those that I feel plays equally well regardless of how many players you have, which is rare for a lot of multiplayer games with a solo variant.

For me one of the funnest parts is once the game is over, looking at what kind of planets you've all formed and discussing what interesting places (good or bad) those might be if they were real.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The only positive things I have to say about this game is the theme, artwork, and flavor text.  To summarize what is going on, you are gravity forces that are landing minerals and elements onto planets to create events coming from your hand.  Each card represents a planetarium event like dense clouds or toxic seas that give the planet a "story" accompanied with meaty flavor text.  

Sadly, that's it for the positive.  The game itself is rather dry and boring as you're only choices in the entire game is to either have your planet move into an element or have an element move to your planet.  If you satisfy a combination of elements for a card in your hand, you spend your elements to play that card which gives you points.  You repeat this again for half an hour or forty-five minutes until the game is done.

I don't mind games with simple rules, but I want to make weighty and enjoyable decisions that have consequences.  Planetarium does not provide that as most of the choices are very obvious and there is barely any interaction with the other players.  Everyone is off doing their own thing, ignoring what other players are doing, and simply collecting elements because their card says to collect them.

Planetarium does try to add a monkey wrench to the mix by having "final evolution" cards.  These are like secret objective cards that take up space in your hand and requires certain criteria to be met for points.  It could be as simple as have a planet in a certain gravity well or have a very specific planet have life and in a certain position.  It feels tacked on and doesn't improve the game with any noticeable margin.

I don't feel any reason to play or own this game.  There are far better games out there to waste 45 minutes of your time

This is a simple, yet very engaging game. It's basically a pick up and deliver, really. You get elements into a planet, which you then transform into different types of evolution, but it's so engaging and nicely themed that it becomes very elegant. 
It's better with 3 or 4 players, since the set up for the end game cards becomes tighter and more fun.

This game is very pretty. It's extremely, extremely easy to teach -- think an even simpler ruleset than, say, Ticket To Ride -- but it offers some opportunities to make interesting decisions. I need to play it a few more times to determine its staying power, but based on my first play I think it will be fun to play with non-gamer friends. I'm just not sure how much strategy there can ultimately be in this game -- my wife thinks it's deeper/more strategic than Ticket to Ride, but to me it seemed like there was *less* depth than there is in Ticket to Ride. Of course, she won the game, so she may have a better handle on the strategy than I do at this point. Either way it's light fun and it will definitely get played again. Playtime is extremely fast, especially once you know what you're doing -- I would estimate as little as 30 minutes a game.

I really enjoyed this game. It had some similarities to a "Lords of Waterdeep" or Quests of Valeria where you are collecting things to complete the cards ("quests") in your hand. What makes it unique and interesting is the collection of the matter (not worker placement liek the other mentioned games). I really like the rotation of the planets and matter along with the ability to shift to closer/outer orbits. There are also some requirements that have to do with matter on orbits and what orbit a planet is one. I wonder how cut throat this game can be knowing what planets people are gathering matter for and trying to block them. This is a game I'd happily play again. It's duration/complexity balance is just right.

--Jul2017-- It's amusing and fast.  I'd be interested in trying with a different number (than the four of my first play, I mean); it might feel quite different with another player count.  But definitely a pleasant little optimization exercise.

Mostly just a set collection game, but the unique movement of the planets around and in between orbits to collide with matter (or have matter collide into them) is thematic, unique, and allows for some good thinky planning. I'm also a big fan of a space theme that isn't all about space battles, shipping cargo, or colonization.

Fairly simple to explain yet with interesting decisions and some long-term planning, along with great artwork and solid components. I was a little worried before sitting down to play the game, but this is a definite keeper for our collection.

Altough abstract, 'Planetarium' makes every effort for the players to feel that its theme —that of the formation of solar systems— is properly overlayed to its mechanics. And believe you me when I say that it achieves that goal. 

Interaction between your movements and that of your oppponents can get to a point when there's little room for you to plan in advance, and that's where 'Planetarium' works better, forcing you to think a few turns in advance to make the best from each planetary or matter movement. 

Halfway there between a gateway and a medium weight game, this will be definitively played as soon as my daughter has the proper age.

Nice flavor and strategy with real player interaction.  Love that there are competing victory conditions.  Some issues with luck of the draw and chaos in the endgame but good strategy still seems to win out.

Great components and great astrophysics theme, but the gameplay feels almost entirely abstract. Not necessarily a bad thing but I was hoping for a better mesh of the two as in Terraforming Mars.

Beautiful artwork, with a clever theme and highly volatile board.  You can plan ahead with some guidance from the Final Evolution cards, but not too far, as the other players are moving pieces that you may want.  The evolution track fills up quickly, and is not scaled for the number of players, so it is important to pay attention, as the game could end unexpectedly.

*I have only played this one solo.  I do enjoy the game, easy to understand and set up.  I liked the movements of the pieces and the different orbits.  The theme came through on this one.  Great game, I'm hoping to try it multiplayer very soon.

3/4/2017:
Played this game with 3 player count and find it to be a good medium weight game. The mechanic that I like from this game is the movement of the planet and how it ties to the requirement for the final cards. This dictates your strategy and how you should move your planet around, especially toward the end of the game. I find it quite enjoyable to play. It's also important to note that the cardboard chits for this game are good quality (thick), but the player's cubes might need to be more than the 8 provided in the game.

A clever and simple game about elements forming into planets.  It's fairly abstract and the mechanics don't really fit well with the premise but *shrug* it plays quickly so it's thematic enough for me.

Backed this one on kickstarter for a love of the theme. The game itself has good quality pieces in a good thick cardboard and well printed thick cards.

The game pacing is pretty good. The 4 games I've played have lasted about 45mins to one hour (3-4 players).

I really like how instead of each player having a planet to play as, the players are competing to play the most cards against a planet. It adds this really fun dynamic as you try an balance playing the most cards against a planet vs playing cards on all the planets to maximise your scoring potential.

The problem we ran into was pacing at the end game. Once the end game is triggered, it becomes a bit of a rush to try and play your final evolutions, and hope someone else doesn't beat you to it. It ends in this weird scenario when everyone's trying to trigger the final round on their turn, so some people started skipping turns towards the end. 

The game also comes with a solo mode that is very hard. I've tried this mode several times and lost every time. It really challenges you to optimise your moves. it's a nice addition to the game, but it definitely works better as a multiplayer game. A lot of the fun is lost when your not conspiring against other players, and the solo game gets frustrating at times.

This game overall is a well balanced experience marred by some pacing issues. It will likely see play occasional in my playgroup, but probably won't be a mainstay. Recommended for casual play, especially with older children.

Another game that the KS backers are rating higher than it needs to be rated because they bought the game ahead of time.  It's a fine game, but only around 381 other games I'd play ahead of this one. Random placement of elements combined with random pulling of cards leaves you with some situations where there is just no control for you.  The game is quick which makes this not such a harsh thing because hey it was time at a table with friends after all right?

This is a game with fresh mechanics that fit very well its theme. It is an interesting game of collecting resources trying to form the right planets that you have been assigned. It has also interesting, educational, info on the cards. It is a cool game!

Really enjoyed this Abstracted Planetary Evolution game.  While triggering the final evolutions to score can be pretty tricky.  The rest of this game is pretty cool.  Great game.  Love the tug-of-war between Hostile  Habitable.  Lots of fun...plays pretty quickly.

Backed on Kickstarter.

An interesting game where the goal is to complete various "Evolution" cards for points. To me, it has a Ticket to Ride kind of feel to it. You know what you need to accomplish (the evolution cards are you "tickets") and when it's your turn, you need to see if any of the matter tokens ("routes") are available for you to take.

It hasn't yet grabbed us as much as I thought it would, but the artwork is splendid, and the whole family would still like to play this one pretty regularly. Who knows, perhaps a future expansion will come and it'll make a "good" game a "great" one.

Pros: Quick set up, easy to learn, fun little educational tid-bits, and just as much fun to play solo as multiplayer. Beautifully designed board and cards.

Cons: Can be over fairly quickly, but just load it up again!

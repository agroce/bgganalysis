Okay, I'm KIND of lying, I have Bananagrams and I play this game with them.  But apparently the reason Scrabble Apple has such terrible ratings is that the quality of the pieces is terrible, so I thought I'd get behind something a bit better.

I like word games, and this one is clever, but there are just other games I'd rather play. Letters are flipped over, words are made, but then you cn steal opponent's words if you make a new, longer word. The tiles are nice.

I'm usually not a fan of word games, but this one was a blast!  I loved the player interaction, both in trying to come up with words before your opponents do, and that you can steal words from your opponents as well.  Great word game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A stressful, anxiety-ridden anagram game.  It probably doesn't deserve as low a rating as I gave it, but it doesn't deserve a whole lot more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Components: Fun, clinky tiles that are mostly easy to read from across the table.

Experience: In general, I dislike spelling/anagramming games. I like Scrabble, but in small doses. This game is pure anagramming, but with a burdensome real-time element, and with all tiles being in play at once. There are just too many possibilities, and too little time to think about them. Not my sort of game.

Eagerness to Play Again: No Desire

Very simple Scrabble-trainer; letters come up and you make words ouot of them, hopefully anagramming your opponents' words into them to make something bigger and harder to steal.

RATING: 6
A word building/anagram game.  A pool of 100 letter tiles is turned over, one at a time.  Players call out any words they can make using the tiles in the pool, plus already completed words by other players.   Play until all the tiles are drawn and players agree that the game has stopped (ie. no more words can be formed).   Score a point for each letter  used in your words past the second letter (eg. "CART" scores 2 points).  Good game - plays fast and works well.

Aka the old family game "Anagrams". Turn up letters one at a time, first person to spot a word gets it. Players can also "snatch" others' words if they can create new anagram, creating vulture-like atmosphere. This classic game from the 1920s is better than modern anagram competitors like Jarnac or other frantic games like Bananagrams. It's a model of elegance. Great family game: Children's quickness and dexterity compensates for vocabulary so different ages can play together equally. Scales well 2-6.  Warning: Snatch tiles are pretty but have glare, use tiles from other games instead.

2nd edition Snatch-It.  This game is ideal to play at the beach, the plastic tiles are impervious to both sand and water.  Additional .5 for the ability to 'steal' words.

Simple word game that involves playing a word and stealing from others by adding letters to build opponents' words into new, longer words.

RATING: 3
I enjoy a good word game now and then. However, I really didn't like this game as it blended a speed element into recognizing words made up of letters scattered upon the table.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fun.   You snatch away the words other people have made, if you can add letters to those words.

Must play more.

RATING: 3
Snatch revealed something to me about the way I like to play word games. I'm often focused on being able to make a nice, satisfyingly rare or large word with the letters randomly available to me, regardless of whether I win. Snatch rubs me the wrong way because it is designed to prevent that: you can have almost all the letters you need to make 'genuflect' and someone can shout out 'nut!' and reset your progress. Seems like a game that rewards vapidity.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
A somewhat entertaining quick word game.  It's major fault is with issues over determining who called out a word first.  Also, this game heavily favors the players who have lots of experience with it as they learn the patterns of certain words and how you can break them up and reassemble them.  Playing with hardcore players as a newbie can be a tad bit frustrating.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A fun word game of creating words from tiles and the other players words.
I call this a speed scrabble game. The other speed scrabble game is Bananagrams. Of the two, I like this one much better. Bannanagrams has too much luck of the draw, whereas that is not a factor here.

It's basically a more competitive version of scrabble, since you can actually take your opponents words. Now instead of finding the biggest word possible, you also need to find the most difficult words your opponents can "snatch" away from you!

And since there's no board for the game, Snatch may also be more versatile as well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A quick word game. Scoring rules favor longer words over a bunch of 3 letter words.  OK for a time filler.

Quite a good game.  Everyone is too busy studying the table to speak.  It's sort of like scrabble w/out the board, and yet everyone plays at once.  Big 'screw your neighbor' factor too.  Plays quickly and is very portable.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Frenetic word building game, short but lively. I think it's a bit light on vowels, but haven't tried it with the Scrabble or Bananagrams tiles. Wordmeisters will kick ass. Tremendously interactive for a word game, as you can steal words from other players, and is fast and chaotic with four or more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

This game is lot of fun if you like word games.  I prefer it to Scrabble and Boggle because the play is fast and it is fun to steal words from your opponents.  Great warm-up game.

Excellent word game. Maybe partly because I am really good at it, but anyway it's superb. The stab in the back when someone steals your biggest word doesn't get much harsher than this.

I'm horrible at this sort of simultanous "first one to shout out the word' type game. (MyWord, etc) But this one adds portability, excellent bits and that ability to stab your buddy and steal his better word!

RATING: 6
This game is sort of disappointing.  I picked it up recently and checked the rules on the outside of the tube and thought to myself "hmmm, sounds like you could play this with any old scrabble set, no, there must be something special about it..."  Well, I was right, I could have played it with any old scrabble set, maybe bought a small poster tube and wrote a naughty word on it, and i would have saved myself the 15 bucks.  As far as game play goes, it almost involves too much thinking, usually not a problem but the gameplay gets very intense and cuts down on talking and banter, and a little bit of the fun.  Sure its an interestign variation on word games, but save the cash, dump your scrabble set on the table and play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Better than Scrabble or Bananagrams for groups. Also allows for players to pick-up/drop-out mid game. Recommend laying out house rules that go beyond what's on the tube.

Why Snatch is fun: The Guys: "So, Christa, how many people can play with your Snatch?" Me: "As many people as can fit around the table, I guess." 27Oct07--Bobby4th and I played with Laura's new Snatch. Husband Dirk didn't seem to mind.

What a great game!!  You don't have to be good at jumbles to play this one, though it helps if you are!  But even if jumbles aren't your thing, this game will help improve your ability to tackle anagrams.  It's a quick, fast-paced game that is challenging and fun.  (Plus it happens to be highly portable)  It's the kind of game that takes maybe 15 mins to play and can be played night after night.  Great game overall!!

For word game lovers like myself, this is a wonderful game.  It makes you quite stressed as you are constantly and frantically trying to snatch other's words, make new words, and protect your own all at the same time.  Not for the casual word gamer!

I love the letter pieces in this game.  They are pretty!  It's a face paced game, but that's really the only advantage it has over Scrabble.  All the same, there is less opportunity for strategy in Snatch It, and I would greatly prefer to play Scrabble.

A streamlined version of [b]Anagrams[/b] where play is always simultaneous and nothing is kept hidden, causing it to be much more frantic and competitive. An improvement.

Though it must be said that this game could easily be played with [b]Scrabble[/b] or [b]Bananagrams[/b] tiles. In fact, with [b]Scrabble[/b] tiles you can play an alternate scoring variant where you count the points of the letters instead of just the tiles themselves - not possible with [b]Snatch[/b].

I got my copy at a thrift shop for 50 cents. Excellent bargain.

I really expected to like this game more.  All the stealing of words, making interesting anagrams I dream of, just doesn't seem to happen though.  Words too often go into dead-ends where it's just too hard to anagram them into something else.  I wonder if a different tile-distribution would make for a better game.

A quick, simple to learn word game with ever-changing situations. The tiles are of top notch.

It looks similar to WordXChange, but in fact subtly different. The real-time characteristic keeps your brain more busy than the planning found in WordXChange. Players are more engaged in response to the very changing words.

Two different games. Enjoy both.

Bug picked snatch out.  she was looking for a game she could take to various different summer activities with her.  It's kind of a fun word building game.  Like if you took away the scrabble tiles and then engaged in competetive word building.  It's kind of fun.

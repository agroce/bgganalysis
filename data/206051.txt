I enjoyed my few plays of this. It is very fast, supporting a smaller player count than a large Werewolf game. I'm not a fan of these type games, so the fact that this was pleasent was quite nice. It is very well designed and smartly reveals a large variety of 'words' to try to guess. The Q&A doesn't need a timer really (at least, not in my opinion). So overall, nice spin on the social deduction elements!

Took this over to our neighborhood Euchre group and ended up playing it 7 times! This was fun and is a great game for non-gamers. It is basically 20 questions mixed with The Resistance. If you are the Insider, you need to steer the questions the right way, but in a very indirect way. I think when I play again, I will also have the Master close their eyes when the Insider gets to look at the word. This would allow the Master to vote on the Insider.

--------------------------------------------------------
Quick Rough Rules Explanation:
It's the baby of 20 questions and a deduction game. At the start of the game each player is given a role card. They are either The Master, The Insider, or a Common. Each role plays a part in the game.
The Master - This role is revealed at the start of the game. They Moderates the game, they know what the word is and they answer everyone's questions.
The Insider - They know what the word is but their identity is secret
A Common - They are clueless, but there are multiple of them in a game.
The Master moderates an eyes closed part of the game, where they find out the word, then let the Insider identify the word(with the master's eyes closed) then they tell everyone to open their eyes and starts the timer. Everyone else asks the Master yes or no questions, trying to figure out what the word is. If nobody gets the word in the time limit everyone loses. The Insider is thrown in there to help lead the commons to the word without blowing their cover. After the word is guessed the timer is flipped over and the new time remaining is the amount of time the table has to discuss who is the Insider, and then try to vote on them (majority, tie broken by player that guessed the word.) If the Insider gets away they win. If the Insider gets caught then the Master and Commons win.
-----------------------------------------------------
I like this game. I probably have it rated a little too high as it's pretty temperamental, but I much prefer it to other group games that were often hitting the table(yea, I'm talking to you Codenames.)

The big negative is we've had some rough Master plays. Normally that is because they Master is being too general, and then the rest of the group never gets zero'ed in on anything. Example that we've had; "is it found in nature?" "is it a watch?" "is it a calculator?" "is it a phone?" all four answers were yes, and the word was Gold. Another mistake we've ran into is us being too liberal with what the Master can say. It's tough being the Master, we allow "maybe" we allow a few "sort of". One game in particular we had a guy playing the master with the word shadow be asked "Do we all have it?" and his answer was "We all cast it when the sun is behind us." (Yea, the same dude from all my other gripes.) So, bad Master play can ruin the game.

We've also had a few plays where the Insider was just not helpful and the time runs out. Normally they blame the Master for answering something wrong, but the entire reason this is a game is because the Insider knows the word and can guide the conversation.

I will admit that the deduction part of this game is tough(especially when you throw out a random role before the game to not guarantee an Insider.) We've had a round where the Insider read the card wrong, was trying to lead us to the wrong clue, then told us after the game that she was shocked when the Master said that we got the word. She skated to victory. In some plays the Insider doesn't even have to say anything and we'll get the word, at which point it's hard to determine who was the Insider, although a lack of participation can be a clue... which segues into another problem your group could have with this game, lack of participation. If people don't talk, this game is dead on arrival. All players really need to get engaged and try to figure out the clue. If anyone is on their phone during this game you need to slap them. It's well within your rights.

Bottom line: The rules are simple. The games are run on a three minute timer so the total play time is under 10. I love deduction games. It's one of those tiny Oink Games that are very portable. It's got a lot of positives, that I think out weigh the negatives pretty handily. As long as your group is playing the game.

Insider boils down to a game of freeform "20 Questions", where one player already knows the answer, and is trying to fit in as if he doesn't. The other players try to figure out who the insider is while playing this game of "20 Questions".

I thought this sounded really fun, but the idea was better than the execution. Many of the words are far too easy, resulting in very quick games that give you nearly nothing to go on. Perhaps it would be better if the clue master could just pick his own word, tending toward more difficult words.

Overall, a fun enough exercise, I guess, but the whole part of identifying the insider felt like a bit of a crap shoot.

This game is a mediocre secret role structure around 20 questions. I don't think it really works.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
What a game! This one goes to a rating of 11 on my list of party games.

My initial fears of introducing this game at one of our family gatherings
was blown away after playing 16 straight games in a row.

  What makes it great in my book?
1. Everybody knows instinctivly how to play 20 questions , so it was an
easy sell rules wise. But the cooperative and urgent speed of solving
this task resulted in the most intense and hectic 5 minutes ,we will
never forget.
2. And to top it all off the hidden traitor mechanic with its deduction
phase was an act of genius. Much easier to handle for the Insider
than either "Spyfall" or "One Night Ultimate Werewolf".

As always I had to make my own Norwegian version using cards
from the game "Stikkord" and a digital countdown timer on the Ipad
plus some brain tokens to keep track of victory points.

  Please somebody make this game available in other languages ,so
that many more people can discover the awesomeness  this game has.

Remember to:  Keep it hectic!  Keep it loud! And don`t dwell to long
on the deduction phase since looking for tell tale signs on youngsters
makes them uncomfortable. Get right down to voting on the Insider
without too much discussion. Keep it fun for everyone!

Very simple and easy to play and portable social deduction word guessing game. Extremely high quality graphic art design by Oink.

Very fun, but very fragile game. You could be the Insider and easily win through no effort from yourself. You could also never get the right answer if the master just doesn't answer the questions properly. 
However, it's better for people who do not enjoy the pressure in Spyfall to like this game, as it is easier to hide.

Kind of like a reverse spyfall. Unfortunately it can fall flat just like Spyfall when people just struggle to ask questions. I think it takes a specific group to be really enjoyable. 

Also it's super easy to imitate unfortunately for the designer/publisher.

Insider is almost like reverse Spyfall. It's also been described as 20 questions meets Werewolf. A basic description is: everyone gets a secret role: common (many of these), master (only one of these), insider (only one of these). The master will reveal themselves. A card secretly tells the master what the group is collectively trying to guess. The insider also knows this, but the master doesn't know who the insider is. The non-master players in free-form will ask questions to the master. To which he will say: yes, no, or I don't know. If the group doesn't get the answer before the timer runs out everyone loses. This is unlikely to happen due to the insider knowing the key word. The insider has to carefully decide what questions to ask and how quiet or talkative he should be to hide his identity. When the word is guessed either the group or the insider will win. The group votes on who they think the insider is.

We've always found that it's usually very easy to guess the answer well before the time runs out. In addition, most of the time it feels like the most quiet person is usually the insider. That's probably group-think and maybe after playing more, it would be different. I also felt it would have been more interesting if the questions were asked in a turn-order, rather than free-form. I guess my biggest problem is that the game just doesn't feel exciting. ONUW is short like this, but has a lot more intrigue. Overall, I recognize it's a clever game, but it ended up being a lot less fun than I thought it was going to be.

Brilliant little party / social deduction game. In the first half, the players collectively ask questions of the master in order to deduce the secret word. In the other half, the players try to determine who among them really knew the word all along. Correctly identify the Insider, and everyone else wins. If not, the Insider wins.

I never expected the Japanese to make a great party game. They have their little niche of cute, not completely developed, bluffing games. And I guess this sort of fits in that mold. But the idea is so simple and fun that it's amazing that no one had come up with it before. It's a more gentle traitor game, one that's easier to approach and teach. And the quick play time is a huge plus since it seems only natural to play multiple rounds at one sitting.

The English version is much superior, in a large group it can be hard to see the English translations on the Japanese cards. But even that is kind of fun. There have been rounds where I, as the insider, wasn't able to see the word in time, so I just played as if I was a common, which allowed me to win.

This is a game of twenty questions with a werewolf-like mechanism to try to determine which player knew the secret word in advance of everyone else.  This is not really my type of game yet it was still rather fun.

Each round consists of choosing and guessing one word; you can play as many rounds as you want.  Because each round plays so quickly, you can just keep playing until you tire out.  And conceivably individual players can come and go throughout the night.

The game comes in a very small box which takes up very little space.  There are quite a few cards in the deck with each one containing six different words each of which might be the designated word for the round.  Still, with enough plays this would eventually need an expansion to refresh the game.

Do we really have free will? Who decides this? Are we controlled by what we hear and what we see, even while thinking we decide freely? Insider is a game that deals with these questions. While communicating to others, you have to find the right answers to a quiz or find the "insider" who is manipulating the discussion. The insider will do everything to hide their identity while misleading the others.

Even though I hate social deduction, this is one I'd play again. However I suspect the novelty would wear out quickly. The answer will usually be guessed even without the prodding of the insider making it easy for them to hide. English text on the cards is micro sized, much smaller than the Japanese. I had to give up one round as the insider as I couldn't read the word, although bad light was also a factor.

A great deception filler game. I found there to be less arguing in this as opposed to ONUW or The Resistance, which can be off-putting for some people.

Docked points because the card deck could be bigger and the component quality doesn't seem the best and showing a litter wear early on.

AMAZING party game... and every time you play you'll play it 5, 10 or 20 times in a row... that's how great this little game is!!

I think it could also be fantastic without the Insider, just play it with the master knowing the word and everyone wins if they get to discover what the word is

Video Review  - https://youtu.be/mERERyhEnWM

Insider has hit the sweet spot for us in a way that other hidden role deduction games haven't. The fact that the insider is on the team and working for the team really makes the game. If spyfall hasn't clicked for you then this is definitely worth a try!

Insider may have killed some existing social deduction games in my collection.  Insider is very accessible for gamers and non-gamers alike, but builds the same interesting decisions, pressure and distrust found in those games.

RATING: 7
(After 7 Plays) 1/30/18: Insider is a unique social deduction game. It has a much simpler set up than many of the other games of this genre and seems easier to understand. With that simplicity however, comes a lack of weight to the game. Unlike other games, it doesn't have the suspense that social deduction usually brings. I don't hate that as it does make this for a much more mellow game but isn't always what I'm looking for in a deduction game. It will still see plenty of play for its large player base, ease of set up, and quick play time.

20 Questions with hidden roles. With just that fusion of concepts Insider was a fast, but average filler. The most interesting part of the game was watching the behavior of the other players.

Then we realized that there was some stupid voting mechanic at endgame that made play significantly more annoying. Forget it, I'm out.

I was pleasantly surprised by this one. Enough that I went out looking for it, but the cheapest I could find it was $22 plus shipping, so I'm going hold for now. Basically it felt like One Night Ultimate Wordwolf. I'm sure my wife would enjoy it.

RATING: 7
Always enjoyed 20-questions on car rides as a kid and this gives a nice little spin to it, as most party games highly group dependent and I had people that would rather just play straight up 20 questions but I like it. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I've always found 20 questions pretty mundane (playing with the kids). Being asked to pay for the privilege here, and then making it easier by allowing a heap more questions through the "jam as many questions into the timeframe" rule as you like, takes it all a step too far. Add a stupid Insider rule, where the Insider wins solo if they play just as dumb as everyone else, just adds insult to injury.

I really enjoy this party game and have had a lot of fun with it. It has gone over well with every group. You get some dud words every now and then but overall, it is one of my favorites to bring out in a social setting.

Turns out that all Twenty Questions ever needed to make it interesting was a hidden role element.  This game is tons of fun; its only real flaw is that finding the insider is sometimes impossible... but it's all quick enough that, who cares, just play it again a few more times.

More subtlety to it than apparent: blasting through the questions to the right answer is one thing, but not giving the Insider any chance to give himself away is another.

RATING: 7
A social deduction game I really like! This is essentially 20 Questions with a hidden role. The 'master' and the 'insider' both get to see the secret word, then the group (including the insider) ask questions with a yes/no/don't know answer to the master to try to guess it within 5 minutes. Once it's guessed, the players vote for who they think the insider is - if they get it right, they win, otherwise the insider wins. 

I was insider in the first game and it's a really tricky balance of trying to steer things in the right direction without giving yourself away. I ended up having to 'guess' the word myself and got unanimously voted for. I was worried this would be a common pattern but in the second game the insider did a brilliant job of framing someone else. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Spyfall style deduction game where you are trying to identify the spy/insider from the group. Styled around the 20 questions format. After a few games the same group may get a bit repetitive with the early questions, but I guess that can be resolved by the different difficulties.

Harmless fun. A gamer's hybrid of "20 questions" and "Werewolf". It is painfully obvious that Bezier's "Werewords" completely ripped the idea of that design from this game. I have played both, and prefer Insider by a long shot.

(+) Quick playing and accessible
(+) Interactive
(+) Plenty of word variety and variability

(-) More of an activity than a game
(-) Repetitive
(-) Guessing the "Insider" can be a crap-shoot, but it does add to the fun of discovering the outcome.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A really good party/social deduction game.  I played with 6 and 8 players, and found that at 8 it was too difficult to identify the Insider because the huge number of players meant they could do almost nothing and rely on the commons to work it out on their own.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
It sounds like this game doesn't stand up to players who try to win, rather than playing within the spirit.  There are some mildly-degenerate strategies to follow that optimizing chance to win but fail to optimize fun.  Oh well, I applaud the creativity of the game none-the-less.

One of my favourite "hidden traitor" games. I prefer the rapid-fire yes/no questions to the surprisingly AP-prone open-ended questions of Spyfall. I really like that nobody wants to get the word too early -- either to get more information or to not give themselves away -- so games tend to pace themselves. The dual tasks of guessing the word and discerning the insider is also. The design of this game has great synergy.

Werewords is probably slightly better (app, rules) but not enough for me to want to replace this. Plus I like the tiny box.

This is a brilliant social deduction game, that gets all of the tension of having a tratior with none of the stress.   Instead of finding the traitor the players are trying to figure out who was most helpful.

Literally, werewolf meets 20 question.. and it is much much better game than those two.  one gripe I had is that english words are pretty small to read.. ( I have Japanese/English copy) and it can be awkward for Insider to try to read the word without making too much body movement.  I think you can substitute the card with other word games or Master can simply write down the word.. similar to Fake Artist.  Another winner from Oink Games..

20 questions with a hidden insider who knows the answer.  Phase 1 is trying to guess the word, phase 2 is trying to guess the insider.  The fact that you have to balance asking good questions while "holding back" to gain information for phase 2 is really interesting.

RATING: N/A
Social deduction game in which you have to root out someone (the Insider) amidst yourselves. The strange thing is, you don't get to play against something (and have a traitor that is actually helping it to happen, be it spies (Resistance) or the classic traitor (BSG, Panic Station)) but you play cooperatively.

To be able to get a shot at rooting out the Insider, you have to deduct the object hidden by the game master before time runs out. The Insider already knows what it is. This results in very strange gameplay: to root the insider, you should all shut up and let him work for it (thus revealing himself in the process). On the other hand, you can't take too long as you have to find the object before time runs out.

So it is a 'social waiting game'. How long can you just shut up and do nothing? With the right crowd, this can result in a very good tension arc. With the wrong crowd (or first timers), this results in a boring analyze, deduct, find the answer and have no clue who the Insider is.

Should try again, found the cost (€18) too prohibitive for a small game like this (plus I'm usually not fond on social deduction games without competitive element) so let it pass. But another Oink masterpiece it is.

Planning to play using a copy of Monikers. Should also work well with Time's Up and possibly Apples to Apples. You could use double-sided cards from Taboo or Codenames by putting them into an opaque card sleeve, or put them into a clear card sleeve along with a regular poker card to keep the back secret.

Monikers (and other word games, usually) came with a number of blank cards so just grab a number of the blank cards equal to the number of question-askers minus one. Then grab a random word from the non-blank cards, have the master look at the word, and shuffle it in with the blanks. Then deal out the cards to the question-askers. The people with blank cards are commons, and the person with the word is the insider.

Update: The game worked great using Monikers cards. In the future I think I'll switch to using Codenames cards, though, because Monikers is mostly about specific famous people and Codenames has a larger range of different words. However, just by leaving the blank cards and the sleeved playing cards in each box, I can basically have a copy of Insider in my Monikers box and my Codenames box at all times. Pretty nice.

The game itself is really good. I've already seen games where everyone lost because the insider didn't want to be too obvious, a game where everyone knew who the insider was, and a game where everyone [i]thought[/i] they knew who the insider was because of a couple of lucky questions. Great fun.

Update 2: Werewords is out now, and it basically takes the exact same game and improves on it. I can still recommend whipping up your own version of Insider to try it out, and if you like it enough, just pick up Werewords.

[b]Player Count Verdict: 6+[/b]
After a few five player games (and many games with 6-7) I've concluded that you need at least six players. With five it can be too hard for the insider. You need more people in the game so the insider can blend in better. If the correct word is guessed in a five player game, there's a 1 in 4 chance that the guesser was the insider. If he is found to be innocent, the players now have a 1 in 3 chance of finding the insider. It's just not as fun.

Wonderful social deduction game, that I really enjoy playing. Because of the small size, I nearly always bring it along 'just in case' I get a chance to bring it to the table. The rules take only a moment to explain, and a game (which normally becomes many in a row) takes 5 minutes - so all in all, a lot of fun condensed in this small red box.

This is a game I wanted to love and was hoping it was on par with SpyFall. I really like the element of firing questions but being the Insider can be quite difficult. I appreciate delicate nature of question asking (and in this case leading to the answer). Gonna play it more to see if it's better with more experience.

Aber bitte mit Sahne with steroids. Quite a lot better. Still lacks in some situations. The fact that pizzas to slice is often not multiple of player count is weird. Doesn't seem fair.

RATING: 6
The production on this is super charming (the box looks like a [much sturdier] pizza box, the score pad is a cheque ticket, the rules are a menu/brochure), though the way the box opens means it NEEDS a rubber band to stay closed, and also the insert is completely worthless. 

The game itself is an interesting take on I pick  you choose, with one special tile/power thrown in per round. The fact that you can't rearrange the pieces of the pizza makes the decision space much smaller, which is good for AP but bad for making you feel like you have much control over your destiny. This makes it fine as a filler but not super satisfying

After owning so many games, I still fall for cute packaging. This game box is exactly like a pizza box with tons of cardboard pizza slices and a scorepad that looks like a receipt. I'm really impressed with how thick the cardboard components are, way better than most of the expensive games. Fun filler, I really like the 'I split, you choose' mechanics.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A great highly-thematic filler with some interesting decisions. The components are excellent including a rulebook that looks like a menu and a score pad that looks like an order pad. This game is built around the "I pick, you choose" mechanic and it works. Not complicated and doesn't overstay its welcome. The only negatives are it's easy to be overcome with AP as a slicer as there's so many possible options and small differences could mean big point swings, especially later in the game. Also the game pieces don't fit in the box that well. This game could really use a good insert.

The choice of how to split the pizza knowing you'll choose the last portion presents a fun but light tactical choice. Daily specials add a nice extra element to the decision. A one trick pony, but the trick is a lot of fun to think about.

"I cut, you choose" is one of my favorite mechanisms, and this is just a cool filler that is all about that mechanism.  The components are top notch, although not a fan of the pizza box lid (even though its thematic, because it opens to easy while traveling with the game.  The special tiles add good variety to the game as well, and all feel like they have their place in the game.  Keeper for sure, and glad to own a copy of this.

I kinda prefer Sundae Split, because of the bluffing aspect, and the fact that it's a tiny box, and cards. This one is still good, but I'm not a huge fan of tiles, and packing it away, shuffling, etc. is annoying.

RATING: 6
Fun idea, but does it have enough decisions?  Sure, the cutter has a choice of how to split the pizza, but then it all depends on how she cut it.  Are there two piles that are equally good?  Or is it kind of obvious that they're all kinda bad?

Then, I guess, you have the choice to eat each slice (with pepperoni) or not.  This is basically deciding whether or not you want to bail out of the majority competition (because if you already *have* bailed out, then it's obvious that you should eat - and the cutter knows this).

Great presentation, just don't know if it has any staying power.

EDIT: Thinking about it some more, I would rather play Sushi Go as a food-themed filler for a larger group.  Everyone makes a decision on every turn, rather than the slicer figuring out the optimal path and everyone else playing their part.

A very unique game. The "I cut, you choose" mechanic is not something I've seen before but it's brilliant. The special abilities add a floating choice for the slicer too and are generally fun without being too powerful.

The game is a bit light for it's length, but it's not too bad. Shuffling tiles is difficult, but I don't know that I'd like this game if it had cards. The tactile feel is important. 

I wish the game made a better distinction between different slices. You can figure it out by looking at just the numbers, but each slice looks very similar to every other slice. I mean - it's pizza, how much different can you make it look? But from a gameplay perspective, it's easy to mistake different slices if you're not careful.

I've spent a lot of time demoing New York Slice at the board game shop I work at, and it does not hold the fun factor after so many play-throughs.

Luckily, it's fairly priced.

[b]Rating based on - 10+ plays, 2 player[/b]
A highly thematic game from presentation (contained in a pizza style box, rules designed to look like a menu, gorgeous pizza slices, and at the end of the 'meal' scores are totted up on a restaurant style bill) to gameplay (one person slices, the others choose portions and decide whether to collect them or eat them).

Seems like the kind of game that there wouldn't be much to, but even though it plays quickly it is interesting, fraught with tense decisions, and very fun with 2. From the beginning we played with the designer preferred variant of cutting the pizza into 4, and although for our first few games we left out the recommended slices we now play with all of the pizza slices and have 6 rounds instead of 4 which feels a lot more satisfying. I could see it still being as much fun with more. 

The only negative is that after the complete thematic treatment of the entire game the insert seems like a bit of an afterthought. it is very, very basic. [i]Barely[/i] an insert really... Also, a warning. While this is not the fault of the game, this is not the type of game to play with calculating players - people who sit across from you like the food police counting what you are collecting and what you are eating so they can make 'informed choices' . This bogs the game down incredibly and makes it boring and totally unfun.

Entertaining I split/you choose filler game. The pizza theme is fun and the components are nice

Splitting is a hard choice but after that, it really depends on who is fighting for each type of slice otherwise you just eat it.

Might be better with 3 than 4 so that you have more types to go for since most people went for 1-2 in a 4p and ate the rest since you can't reorder the pizza before splitting. I think that limits the ability to play around sets and most of the time you are all in if you go for one

RATING: 4
It's a quick and easy game with a great theme. It has fun choices but can break a bit if the slicer slices poorly, and it's hard to slice well. The choices are mostly obvious and when slicing it feels impossible to do well, because with enough players you can't avoid giving someone exactly what they want. It feels like the person that got hated on the least will win, which isn't particularly fun. The theme is great and I love the thick pizza slices, but the art on the slices look awful, it's like they deliberately made them look inedible. That's a shame, because the box and scorecard are great and I would honestly play the game more if the pizzas we slice looked better.

Cutting the cake--er--pizza is much tougher this time around; a few daily specials floating around, combo slices, and that wild slice--you're not really sure if you are going to get the points for collecting your slices; the leads feel less absolute. Which is makes the game more tense/exciting than its predecessor, Piece O' Cake. Plays very quickly; nice filler.

Easily replaces Piece O' Cake.  Better theme (pizza!), better rules (the "Specials" are an awesome twist), and production values that will make you smile (the box is a pizza box, the rules are a menu, the score sheet is an order slip...wow!).  You'll be able to seat up to a table of 6 and the play time is actually quite fast.  There aren't this many good games that accommodate this many players in such a short amount of play time.  I'd say it's a must have in your collection because it is so versatile.

I'm a huge fan of Piece o' Cake, but I found that all the things NY Slice added to consider when splitting made the cutting phase lag just a bit too much for my tastes.

Production quality for this game is top-notch!  Nice thick tiles, excellent graphic design, a rule book that looks like a pizzaria menu, guest check scorepad, and even the box is fun and thematic.  Great little game using the "I split, you choose" mechanism.  Divvy up the pie, but do it in a way where you get something you hopefully want too, since the slicer gets the last pick.  Add in some Special of the Day tiles to break some rules to shake things up.  Super-easy to learn/teach and is a zippy filler.  Immediately one of my favorite fillers, in fact!  :-D

A better version of Piece o' Cake. Better art with the same "I pick, you choose" mechanism. New York Slice has additional "daily specials" which add another layer of analysis and scoring. I really like this version. They did an amazing job on theme, from the box, to the rulebook, to the heavy cardboard pizza slices. Well done production.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The presentation of this game is really good and I think more games should use the I split you choose mechanism, but somehow the game just didn't really grab me. I think it is due to the thematic discord of the abstract set collection majority of each pizza slice type, and that while I split you choose usually makes for some agonizing decisions, here it somehow felt pretty tame.

Fast and easily game of divide and choose.  One player divides the pizza however he wants, but he also gets the last pick.  Dividing the pizza into wedges of approximate value is tricky, especially with six players.  Six players is also where the game is best: every player gets exactly one chance to divide the pizzas.  Production is excellent from the thematic box, thematic rules, thematic score sheet, and beautiful pizza slices.  I'm always craving pizza after playing this game.

It's entirely a question of taste, of course, but I like the white dollops of cream (as points) much better than all those big, red, ungainly pepperonis. Also the graphic design of the "specials" is kind of drab and detracts from the overall visual impression. The split pieces look especially odd, and I don't think the game needed tiebreakers anyway. Let alone negative points (what's wrong with anchovies?), which don't make thematic sense.

(4/17) 8. A filler, maybe filler plus? game...but pretty much perfect for what it is.  Simple rule set, moves quick, with plenty of interesting decisions and a presentation that just CANNOT be beat.  The best "I split, you choose" game I've played.

(10/17) Drop to 7.  Still great, but has fallen just the tiniest bit flat.

It's a simple game of "I split, you choose", but it's fun! While not a brain burner, you definitely have to keep an eye on your opponents as your decisions will directly affect their (and your) outcome. This game can be mathed out, so this might be a little AP-prone for a filler. The pizza theme is brought out brilliantly by the production.

We loved Aber bitte mit Sahne so were excited to see this reissue, especially with beautiful-looking components. The pizza box packaging, the menu style rules, the order pad as scoresheets - wonderful (although the pieces don't seem to fit into the box very well). After a couple of plays, we are unsure about the bonus scoring as some combos seem to be overwhelming. I had the "double slices are worth 2 rather than 1/2" and "win all ties" bonuses in our first game and it wasn't fun for anyone. We might just need to curate the set of bonuses to avoid these synergies, but we're still on the fence. The anchovies seem to add complexity without adding any real interest.
The big disappointment in the game - and it really was a BIG disappointment - was the pizzas themselves. They all look unappetising, and some are even hard to tell apart. Where are the vibrant colours and interesting flavours? These pizzas look washed out, bland and boring, with very few toppings - we all agreed that we'd probably send most of them back. We played just before lunch, expecting to feel hungry, but were left feeling meh. The pizza imagery didn't live up to the rest of the glorious graphic design.
It's a great implementation of "I cut, you choose" so I still recommend it, but I'd rather eat cake.

I think I prefer the original rules of Piece O' Cake. What is nice is that you can play this version with those rules or with the new additions (half slices, anchovies, special abilities).

Just a fun game that is gorgeous to look at and nice to the touch. The contents are amazing. From the look & feel of the box & rule book (the menu) to the Daily Specials and slices of pizza. It is a simple game, easy to teach and quick to play, using the "I choose the slices, you decide which one to take first." Mainly set collection (majority of each numbered type slice) or future VPs (by "eating" the slices & counting their pepperoni) with some in game action and end game points from the specials. Fast, fun. A delight for art and graphic design. :)

Great job on theme and production on this one. The box is a pizza box. Pizza slices look great. Score pads are restaurant checks. Smooth.

Actual game is also pretty fun. You take turns splitting up an 11-slice pie (which can't be done completely evenly). The person who slices it picks last, though! 

Fun and plays in around 30 minutes.

[b]New York Slice[/b] was sold via auction 11/18/17.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8/10):[/COLOR]

[i]I hadn't played Piece o Cake, but always thought it'd be great to play with my family so I picked up NY Slice when I got the chance. NY Slice is the best I split you choose game I've played and will probably replace Animals On Board in our collection. 

NY Slice does add one new mechanic, the bonus cards. When I play with my youngest daughter (6) I'll leave the bonus cards out to begin with just to keep the game straightforward. However; I played a few times over the weekend with my older daughter and friends and included the cards, they add a bit more strategy to the game especially when dividing the pie. 

I have to mention the production as well, NY Slice might have the best combination of theme and components in a game I've played. The box opens up like a pizza box, the score pad looks like an order pad, the directions look like a menu and the daily special tiles look like chalk board signs. The pizza slices are nice and think and the artwork is great, a huge thumbs up from me![/i]

First, let me say that this is maybe the most beautifully-produced game I've ever seen.  I'm not talking about having a million miniatures or whatever--I'm talking about the menu, the scoring pad, the box, *everything* evoking delicious slices from a New York joint.  Beautiful.

That said... the actual *play* of this game is honestly pretty miserable.  The "all or nothing" nature of getting the majority means that the final round of the game, in particular, feels like a whole bunch of kingmaking, where you pick the thing that is least worst for you and most worst for everyone else.  This feeling honestly exists through the entire game.

Someone watching our most recent game made the comment that he wished he had taken a photo of us in the last round, because we all had deeply unhappy looks on our faces.  I believe it.

I appreciate the design, I love "I cut, you choose" as a mechanic... but I have no real desire to ever play this game again.  I just flat-out don't enjoy it at all.

A re-theme of the game [thing=37371][/thing], and while I love cake, I love PIZZA so much more! From the Menu to the Check this game delivers a delicious meal. It is an easy filler of a game that can be played with 6 players. You are trying to cut the pie so that when each player takes their portion it leaves you with the portion you actually want. In the set collection game you artery to get majorities in the different sets of numbers. Clever game and so much fun to play

RATING: 6
I played Piece o' Cake several times a few years ago and really enjoyed the elegance of the pie-slicing and the self-balancing of the eat-or-keep choice. I didn't have my own copy though, so when New York Slice came along I thought I'd take a punt. 

It's taken what seems a common path these days of reimplementing an older game by garnishing it with extra mechanisms and scoring options. On the whole I disapprove, though I still enjoyed the game as the central mechanism is so strong. 

My biggest complaint is the artwork - the colourful fruit pies were easy to distinguish at a glance, while the weirdly photo-realistic pizza is just so... yellow. And it takes a special kind of talent to put a game in a box four times the size of the previous version but that doesn't fit the pieces properly.

RATING: 8
The central idea of "I'll slice, you choose" is a brilliant game mechanic. The graphic design on this game is perhaps one of my favorites of all time--the box is like a pizza box, the rule book is like a pizza menu, and the score pad is like a guest check at a restaraunt. It's just a brilliant combination of things that make it really stand out. The pizza slices themselves are a bit hard to tell apart besides their numbers, which is the one sore spot in an otherwise stellar presentation. 

Fortunately in this one the gameplay holds up as well. It's not quite as great as the components, but it's a smart and worthy game. Deciding how to slice the pizza is agonizing, often picking your slices is tough, and deciding what to eat is also tricky--for the point values are carefully weighted such that eating a slice or keeping it can both be quite viable. 

The only other downside to this is that it can take awhile to add up the points at the end and determine the winner. It also is a game that can seriously bog down if playing with someone who wants to spend the time to constantly analyze how many points everyone currently has when deciding how to slice. Unfortunately that extra analysis likely will actually help such a player win, but it will bog the game down to a super slow speed. If your group is plagued by such a player, you probably should stay away from this game or you'll probably hate it. 

Fortunately I don't have that issue and so I look forward to continued plays of this game.

I divide/you choose has become a popular game mechanic these days. I like how well it lends itself to both simple and deep games. New York Slice is certainly more on the simple side, but at the right player count it can feel very rewarding manipulating the table into letting you have the slices you really crave. Definitely inspired by Piece O' Cake, but the daily specials add a welcome layer of depth.

Great production value for this game.

The box looks like a pizza box.
The rules booklet looks like a pizzeria menu.
The scoring sheet looks like an pizzeria order pad.
The special tiles look like a chalk-board special.
The pizza tiles look like real pieces of pizza.

The "you split, I choose" mechanic is more engaging than you might think.  You will be tortured as you try to best divide the pizza.  Another interesting decision is what to collect, and what to eat.

Good game with great production.

This is a light and easy game.  I can see myself playing this with a wide audience.  The "I split, you choose" is pretty fun, although it can get bogged down by analysis paralysis.  Some people will simply take too long to make this decision and it can ruin the game.

I probably won't buy this game, but would definitely play it if asked to.  It's a lot of fun.

Great game that I can get most people to understand and play.  A simple mechanism (I split you choose) that offers deeper game play.  It kind of reminds me of Castles of Mad King Ludwig in that you have to appropriate the set of tiles that people will be buying/choosing in the game.  In Castles, which I still enjoy, I experience much more AP during the splitting up of tiles.  In New York Slice, while the mechanism is similar, I have less AP.  I think it's because the game is faster and there really aren't many other mechanics to to consider.  

I really like the specials as they can be a very powerful tool of persuasion to get someone to grab a special that may be helpful later in spite of the less than optimal slice of pizza they took.

RATING: 7
The components look great and there are some nice thematic touches visually to it (i.e. the guest check scoring card). Although I think I prefer the look and theme of cake (from the original version of the game, Piece o'Cake) to pizza, oddly enough, even though normally I'd think pizza is an awesome theme. I guess it's because the pizza types don't look nearly as visually different to be able to tell what people have easily from across the table, whereas cake allows for more distinguished colors.

I also think I prefer the 'I split you choose' mechanisms in Animals on Board to this, but this is easier to get to the table because it supports six players. Also if I want to play an area control game with cards in a pyramid distribution (3 3's, 4 4's, 5 5's, etc) I'd rather play 12 Days or Holmes: Sherlock and Mycroft.

I don't know, I really expected to like this game better than I did, but instead of a game I was excited to play, it's only a game I won't say no to if others want to play it, but probably won't suggest it myself.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
My plays of this game so far have been underwhelming, though it is a pretty game.  Since all player's pieces are face up (unless turned down for points), it's possible to math out a pretty optimal slice distribution.  If you've got AP players in your group, they can and will do this, which grinds the game to a halt.  This came can surprisingly induce AP in those otherwise not prone to it.

"I Split, You Choose" is an interesting mechanic that I seldom see in games - research suggests only a handful of others utilize it - but supposedly this is the most popular example of it (including its original release [b]Piece 'O Cake[/b]). I think I need to play the game several more times to wrap my head around the strategy and tactics involved with the mechanism, but it has me intrigued. That said, I must confess it is the theme and production values that engages me the most - I think my enjoyment wouldn't be as high if it had any other theme.

New York Slice has an appealing theme and is a very nice production with it’s thick pizza slice tiles, pizza box packaging, menu-formatted rules, and scorepad that looks like an order ticket, but I don’t care for the artwork on the pizza slices.  I would have preferred more of a hand drawn/line art or professional photography of some beautiful pizzas rather than the sem-realistic look that is currently on the pizza slices.  Regardless, it’s still functional, doesn’t look completely horrible, and doesn’t affect my overall enjoyment of the game.  I never played the original Piece O’ Cake from which New York Slice evolved and can’t therefore can’t compare the two versions, but I feel that everything in this game works well together.  I like the fact that there are some extra slices that aren’t used and are not known thereby preventing perfect information about the slices available in the game.  I also like how the Daily Special tiles can throw strategy curveballs or even offer redemption for a previous mistake.  There are tough decisions in how to split the pizza, what portion to take (especially if you are early in the turn order for the round), and whether or not to eat any claimed slices, but turns generally happen quickly and the total game length ends up feeling just about right.  I like New York Slice overall and have enjoyed my experience with it so far.  After all, what’s not to like about pizza?!

So far it's working well with groups of 6. Takes a few games for most players to develop a more aggressive or strategic skill set, since they become distracted with the visual components. "Looks good enough to eat"...yeah, you'll hear that quite a bit until they sink their teeth a little deeper into the strategic nature of the game. Rating may change over time but for now it's pretty high based on a few plays.

Pretty good with 6 since everyone slices once, which is a pretty tough role. The rest of the game you get to sit back and talk bad about everyone else's slicing choices. It won't blow your mind but quick rules and doesn't outstay its welcome. I really like the end game scoring process.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a really good light, almost party-style game.  I love the mechanic of "I cut, you choose" which I don't remember ever seeing in a game before.  So in this game a set number of pizza slices are pulled at random (I believe it is 11 to ensure there will never be equal pieces) and then the start player of that round will separate the slices into a number of selections equal to the number of players.  They don't have to be equal or even but all other players get to pick their sections and the start player gets whatever is left.  So it behooves them to try to make it as even as possible so they aren't left with crap, although one man's crap could be another man's treasure in this game which offers a pretty decent amount of depth to an otherwise really simple easy-to-teach game.

So the way scoring is going to work at the end of the game is each slice has a number on it.  Whoever has the most slices of that number at game end gets that number of points, this is also the number of slices of that pizza so the more points it is worth the harder it will be to obtain sole majority.  You can also eat slices for immediate points (if it has pepperoni on it) and anchovies on your slices lose you points.  Finally, there are power cards, one of which is drawn each round and added to one of the selections.  These can be worth points or give the player an action or special ability.

This is just an all around superb game.  It's not the deepest or most engaging but it's deep enough to actually make you consider your decisions, especially as the "slicer".  And it can be played and taught to almost anybody of all ages.

The production quality alone makes this one feel worth having. The game itself is fine, not much going on really not overly bothered about playing this one with experienced wizards but it could be good for playing with muggles.

Wonderful reimplementation of ...aber bitte mit Sahne! The Daily Special tiles are a great addition.

Fantastic components in this thematic pizza dividing game, but the game itself fell flat. No gaming decision here gave the pleasure of devouring a tasty pizza but rather left me feeling a little ill. Choose how to divide the pizza and then be stuck with the leftovers. Eat pieces only because there's no hope of having the majority of that type of pizza. Count slices at the end just to find some slices will go to waste because only having the most scores points.

played at a local convention, now that I understand the rules a bit more I would have played very differently. I recommend if you enjoy pizza.

Fun filler (although a bit long just for filling)
Interesting choices and caried strategies
Good party game, especially when hungry!!!

This is a fun family-style game using the "I slice, you choose" mechanic. Very enjoyable.

The theme is more appealing to me than its previous incarnation, but much more importantly, we now have single-round effects that mix things up enough to take it from being a benign and pleasant game of divide-and-acquire, to a nice game of the same, but with a little something different each time.

Simple to teach and play but good strategy will get you the win.  The box, rules, and score tracker add a great feel to the game

RATING: 8
I played the original Love Letter, and thought it was great. Saw this, and knew it would fit for the family. This is the first real "board game" that I've gotten my 3-year old to play, and the family loves it. The art is great, the gameplay is solid and easy to teach, and the game never overstays it's welcome. You can pick it up just as easily as you put it down. I'm always game to play this for 5 minutes or several hours.

I actually find it hilarious that there are so many genuine rethemes of the... "game". To me it accentuates the glaring lack of theme in any shape and form. It would be fine if it didn't try to sell itself as having flavor, but it does.

A good spin on Love Letter.  The bat symbol mechanics are good.  Gorgeous art.  The bag in the clamshell version is small, and you find it difficult to get your cards in and out if you sleeve them.

With the play of one more card the game change from just guessing to very predictable.
Funny idea with a fatal flaw.

A fun quick filler.  It can be too easy to count the cards, but the one unused card mitigates this just a bit.

RATING: 6
Essentially the very same game as Love Letter with one exception, i.e., you may gain additional points for making right guesses. I am not so sure that the new theme fits the concept of the original game but, at least, it was equally fun.

What you have to admire is that here we have a game with player elimination but this time it does not matter because the rounds end so quickly.  There is one concern though, Love Letter can get a bit repetitive after a number of plays. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I'd put this version slightly ahead of the original because I like getting points for hitting with Batman.  If I didn't already have a copy of the original, I'd probably get this one instead.

RATING: N/A
Da na na na na na Da na na na na na... BATMAN! So yeah, love letter has adopted the monoploy "theme for everything they can think of" marketing strategy. This is one of the better variants though. When you guess correctly, you get a point, whether it is the princess or not. Which is nice thematically aligned game rule. You are awarded little wooden bat signals for points instead of red cubes like in the original Love Letter and also, the princess is The Joker, which is funny to me.

At first I might have aligned myself with the rabble rousers and whined about how the retheming of popular games is killing the hobby, but after trying Batman: Love Letter I have to say I really enjoyed how the theme was integrated with the base mechanics, and this is currently my preferred way to play the game.

It's just the same regular game, with Batman, True, the fact that Batman (card number 1) can't attack other 1's or 4's (Robin) adds a little change, but it's just not enough to justify a whole new rating for me.

The Batman version of this great game is basically as much fun as the original.  The added mechanism of getting additional points by using Batman to stop villains is thematically appropriate and gives the game a swinginess it never could have had otherwise.  The fact that sometimes you don't want that swinginess is the only reason it is not better than the original.

When I first heard about Love Letter: Batman, I thought they were going to rename it to have a better attachment to the theme, but I was wrong.  The Batman implementations to this game, however, do not work with two players, but the game is still fun, nonetheless.  I enjoyed the theme and have already enjoyed Love Letter in the past.

Similar to the original Love Letter with better (okay, super hero) art and one rule twist.  If Batman guesses anyone else other than Robin (and self) they are out and you collect a Batman token.  Helps the game to play a little faster and adds a way for players to game points.  First to 7 wins.

I actually prefer the artwork of my regular one, although I think it's still good the characters seems so sinister and unfriendly, even Robin scares me, heh, however it's Batman so this one gets played more now that we have it. This also has the same problem of dark edged cards making sleeving, which I'm not a fan of, a must.  My family likes being able to collect the bat symbols every time they guess correctly, not just one for winning at the end of the round although I feel this takes away a bit from it since it discourages people from guessing their own card to throw people off... I suppose it could be argued it makes it more interesting since there's a cost to it though....hmmm.

Based on 1 play with 4 players:

I'm a huge fan of Batman so I wanted to try this at some point just to hold the little Bat-tokens. They did not disappoint.

Otherwise... yeah, this is Love Letter. I'm pretty indifferent to the added rule of getting a VP for correctly guessing with Batman. It certainly feels good, though it's somewhat weird that you can win the round but NOT get the most VP. Also when we played this we were teaching two people who had never played Love Letter before, and they had trouble remembering the "gotcha" parts of that rule (i.e., only works if you knock someone out via Batman + doesn't work if it's Robin) so it does feel just a little less elegant without much benefit.

The real reason this gets a lower rating than base LL is that I'm not a huge fan of the art. Sure, it's taken from the comics but it's not a style I particularly dig.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I've played "vanilla" Love Letter and this version, and I love the theming of this one. They are both the same game, but I'm big Batman fan, and so this one takes the cake! Fun lightweight game that just about anyone should be able to play, and if you have any interest in the theme, it's a win win.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This is Love Letter with a different theme - and one minor rule change, as you get a token when guessing correctly with Batman (i.e. a guard). This speeds up the game slightly (you need to get more tokens to win than in regular LL), but also probably makes it a little more random as a lucky hit with Batman means an extra token. It's ok, but like regular LL it's not really my cup of tea; I find it too long for what it is.

This is the game I have played the most it’s always in my bag. If you play a board game and it ends early but not early enough for another board game, then this is for you, a single round of cards takes a couple of minutes and you can cut it short first to 3, or 5 normally seven bat symbols. Best played with four I have stretched this to five and it didn’t suffer. The artwork on the cards is very good, strategies can vary I have seen random guessing put people out. Overall a very quick and good game.

The Batman theme appealed to me so much more than the original Love Letter.  

It's quite an accomplishment to create such a clever game out of only 16 cards.

Fun, short, clever game.  A great filler.  Artwork on the cards is cool.  The Batman tokens are fab.

I'd love to see some mini expansions adding The Penguin, The Riddler or Scarecrow.  Although with so few cards in the base game could adding new cards throw the balance off?

A Batman version of the popular bluffing game Love Letter, this game is one that me and my friends will sit down and play over and over again. It is quick, easy, and a lot of fun.

If you are a fan of Batman and of the card game Love Letter, I highly suggest that you pick this game up.

Yeah, the name is as silly as it gets. When I got it I prefered it to the original Love Letter, just because of the fact that when eliminating someone using Batman, you got a victory point, thus making the game faster. But I hated that noone was calling Robin when using Batman, so I just took the rue and transferred it to regular Love Letter, giving an extra wooden heart (with which I have replaced cubes) to the player who successfully uses a Guard card (even when calling the level 4 Maid).

I'm rating this the same as Love Letter.  I don't like the art as much as the original (personal preference - I don't like cheap comic book art), but I like the slight game play changes a little better.  

My biggest hurdle is explaining to people the name of this game when they ask what it has to do with love letters.  It has nothing to do with love letters! It should be called Batman: Gotham City (or anything else).  I understand the publisher has to pay royalties, but the current name gives me the heebie jeebies and makes no sense with the game play.

It's love letter again. I like the added rule, it adds some relevance to the early game, however it makes the 4 even more OP. The art is nice, but if you're not a fan of the theme there's no reason to own this above any other version as the only difference is in the rule set.

This is one of my favorite games. It is quick and easy, and pretty much anyone can play it.  I have found that this one is actually much more fun if you disregard the batman guessing batman rule. We usually allow batman to guess batman and it makes the game go much quicker and there is a lot more laughter and table talk.

We actually get a version of this for most people as a gift. It is fun, fast, and cheap.

This is the same as regular love letter but successfully using a guard on anyone but the handmaid will give you an extra love cube (here shaped like the bat-symbol). To account for this a win takes seven love bat-symbols. Bizarre and unnecessary. The fact that this is half a point lower than regular love letter comes mostly from the fact that it's more random and seemed longer, but also a little bit from the fact that it's just an odd re-theme and I find the recent cultural fixation with Batman annoying. Almost as bad as if they made Love Letter: Bacon.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (May 2015)

I was curious about this title so I bought it. At this point, my friends and I are tired of seeing Love Letters all over the place, so it was a bit of a struggle to get Love Letter: Batman to the table. After playing it I wasn’t surprised nor disappointed. It is still THE SAME Love Letter with very minor changes. I liked the changes though. 1. The game has now very good artwork and I love Batman. 2. Now you need to get 7 points to win the game, at first I didn’t like it but with the new Batman ability you can finish this game faster than regular Love Letter which is a huge plus for me. It also has the added benefit of keeping all players in the fight as there are more VPs to be gained each round. 3. The VP tokens are GORGEOUS and the best part of the game by far.

I found weird that the new Batman ability isn’t listed on the card, you have to read the game manual for that.

For the clamshell edition, the bag is also very nice looking.

Bottom line, I’m tired of Love Letter in all its forms. It is a fine game to play from time to time (if played quickly) but I already sold all my Love Letters editions. I don’t think I will play it again this year.

Replace the original Love Letter characters with Batman, Catwoman, Bane, Robin, Poison Ivy, Two-Face, Harley Quinn and The Joker. Then make the tokens Bat symbols, change the colour of the cloth bag to grey and add the Bat symbol, and then -- finally -- change the victory condition to 7 wins instead of 4. This adaptation is mostly cosmetic changes, and yet... it works.

PLUS: use of Batman art, still Love Letter, still wonderfully fun and portable
MINUS: not much of a difference so it's duplication if you have the original

Na na na na na BATMAN!  Na na na na na LOVE LETTER!  This game takes the proven and excellent mechanics of Love Letter and adds a theme which for me takes it a step up.  I guess I'm a sucker for Batman, but I really like the added mechanic of using Batman to knock out an opponent and receiving a point for doing so.  With or without that addition, it's still a great game and having Batman art added makes it all the better for me.

The simple addition of awarding a point when properly identifying another player does add quite a lot to the Love Letter version. So an upgrade over the base game. I'm less fond of the values being equaled to specific characters though... one of the fun things about Love Letter is that the low valued cards represent rather generic 'character classes' whereas the high value cards represent a single person with only one copy of him/her in the deck.

This version works well with the slight rules changes included from standard Love Letter.  I think the theme comes across nicely as proven by our 8 year old who can really get into it.  The beauty of Love Letter is the deduction that comes from only having to keep track of a few cards (i.e. basic card counting as a game mechanic) that even an 8 year old can do.  The guessing part is therefore fun as it's generally not wildly random.  The small hand size of 2 cards plays nicely against the cards straight forward abilities yet there is definitely some good decision making and strategy,  even bluffing once you've played it a bit.  It still can feel a bit random at times but it doesn't upset me in this game like it does some others.  The game felt too long playing to 7 tokens until we realized we were playing the Batman card wrong especially in 2 player games (Winning with Batman in 2 player games essentially gives you 2 tokens).  We enjoy it about equally with 2 and 3 players (Haven't tried 4 yet).  I'm rarely a fan of games that don't come in boxes but here again the provided small drawstring bag really works and its quite a nice production overall.  Definitely the version of Love Letter to get.  So inexpensive as well and takes up no space.  I do really feel for these reasons it's a must have for any game collection.

Plays just like regular Love Letter but all of the cards are from Batman.  It has the modern comic book art.  It was fine but I am not a huge comic book fan.  It does have nice bat signals that you get if you win.  It is a pretty good edition if you like Batman and Love Letter.

I like Love Letter and this version adds a twist. Using the Batman card (Guard) to knock out another player gives you a batman sign (heart) and the winner needs 7 in a 4 player game. This adds importance to making the right guess.

I like how being Batman (in the guard role from the original) is a different way to gain points by guessing the opponent's card correctly. The name is silly, and I've seen it made fun of in different places, but the theme does give it the edge for me personally over the original.

Love Letter Batman is just as good as normal Love Letter. The major difference is that the game is supposed to last until someone reaches 7 points. I can understand that this could work in a two-player game, but with four players the game sorely overstays it's welcome. 

The cards look good though, they feel nice and sturdy enough. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
One minor rule change sets this apart from Love Letter (And we literally never used it, but that was due to the group we were playing with) so I'm mostly dinging it for having a weaker theme than Love Letter.  Otherwise it's the same game.

It's Love Letter... but the subtle change of getting 1 point when you rightly eliminate one player by using Batman makes a big difference on how the game is played and enjoyed  It also allows for bigger and faster swings in the game like it happened in this one

The best Love Letter game. As the Batman (Guard) action gets you 2 tokens instead of one if you guess the right villain. it speeds up the game and I prefer the art/theme.

RATING: 8
Slightly more than a simple re-theme, in this iteration a correct guess of another player using Batman (the Guard in this game) instantly earns a bat signal (rose).

This makes the scoring more dynamic and means a player can collect more than 1 point in a single round. 

For me an improvement on the original for sure.

It's just like Love Letter... except with Batman!  What more do you need?!

Seriously though, the slight tweaks in this version work really well - awarding a bat-token for eliminating another player from the round works well to drive the pace of the game forward, that can sometimes bog down with vanilla Love Letter.

I'm annoyed at the hype surrounding Love Letter.  Is it just because it uses so few cards?  Sure, it's more than the sum of it's parts... but that still isn't much. It's an OK game.

It's Love Letter.  It's a fun game, hard to go wrong with it.  It's odd they didn't decide to change the name at all (like Munchkin's "Loot Letter"), so it's hard to get people interested in it at first.  BUT, the game is good, and with this particular version over the original, when you correctly guess another player's character, you get one VP, instead of ONLY winning at the end of a round.  I think that's one of the smartest rule changes made in the series.

Love Letter is our most played game....so I decided to try this retheming.  I like the way that a successful guess by Batman (the guard) is worth one point same as winning a hand.  7 points wins the game.

After 70 games of the original, and so many wonderful and hilarious experiences with the game, we find it a little difficult to switch to the new retheming.  This is because all the roles (guard, priest, baron, handmaid, prince, king, countess, princess) have grown to be good friends over 70+ plays.

I will update this post in a few months after getting in a few more plays of Batman.

I hate it to admit, but the Batman theme did make me like it more. Yes, the gameplay mechanics are pretty much the same as the original, but I still like it more, maybe just because of the art. I taught my cousins, age 4 (girl) and 6 (boy) the game and they both loved it. I got to explain to my cousins the different characters, which was a lot of fun, and how the mechanics tied in to the different characters. My female cousin really liked the girl characters, especially Harley Quinn and Catwoman. This makes for a great way to introduce young children to the rogues of the Batman universe.

The characters lend themselves very well to the game mechanic.  Its not just a cheap copy/paste, the use of the Batman universe actually makes some sense to the game play.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
2 plays

Same game, basically, but with several interesting modifications:
- with the Guard card (here, Batman): 
... may not guess "Batman"
... if you correctly name a criminal (not the Robin (4) card), you get a bonus 1 VP
- end-of-round: if held cards are the same, tie breaker is having higher sum of cards played this round
- game ends IMMEDIATELY when someone gets to 7+ VP, regardless of player count

I like the little twists:
- calling someone out with Batman is fun!
- now you may want to hold onto your Robin, since it's less likely to get called out by Batman
I'm less sure, though, about the always 7 VP end trigger: seems like games could last too long, especially with lower player count? Still, overall I think I prefer this a bit over the base version of the game.

RATING: 5
Love the gameplay. The innovation of getting tokens for knocking out villains is great. Extremely inappropriate artwork, though. Had to sleeve these to cover up some of the art.

My second-favorite Love Letter. The Batman (Guard) card rule change makes this game really quick and tense.

RATING: 9
Taking the Love Letter game and pasting it onto Batman sounded ridiculous, and then I played it.  The simple mechanic of needing batsymbols to win and getting more symbols for guessing (Batman being the detective) was cool.  Then add on the great Batman art, it's great.

RATING: 6.75
It's Love Letter with Batman and crew -- what's more to say? The game is small, cheap, and simple enough to appeal to non-gamers while game-y enough to prove a good filler for more serious gamers. Love Letter is a safe bet to add to any game collection, so the only real question is which theme/version you want to pick up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Very fun game that gets you even more into it if you are a Batman fan.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Straight Love Letter with the (optional?) added rule that for every non-4 that you eliminate with the 1 (Batman!) you score an extra point. This sounded like a terrible idea and it probably makes the game more random but also fixes the terrible AEG variant of playing too many rounds.

Aside from the expected quibble about the Harley Quinn artwork, it's a good port.

RATING: N/A
See base Love Letter.

You are attempting to get the most evil villain into the Asylum. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Keeps to the Love Letter franchise, but with a Batman theme. Each elimination gives you a token, which makes the game progress a lot faster. You don't have to be the winner of each round to actually win.
Definite recommendation to Batman fans that want a quick filler.

RATING: 9
Wasn't sold on this one at first, due to its simplicity, but it's become one of my group's favorites.  It's lightning quick fun, good deduction game. Portable (it's only 16 cards plus tokens), incredibly intuitive and easy to learn and teach newbies, zero setup, good way to kill 15 mins with friends.  Plus hey, the tokens are little Batman symbols.  Funny thing about this game is, it's anyone's game even to the end.  No matter who's in the lead early on, most of our games have ended with a "Comeback Kid" who was trailing behind and then suddenly shot to first place with a few fast rounds.

Well being a huge batman fan, I love this game, but even if I just bought the regular Love Letter theme game I would still enjoy it.  I love that the game is so fast and rounds go quickly.  Trying to figure out who everyone is and making sure you stay alive or have the highest number is awesome.  I wish it went to a higher player count, but still is an awesome deduction game that I love to pull out.

It's Love Letter but, instead of trying to win the affection of a princess, you are trying to beat up the Joker.  This does not change the game mechanics.  The comic book art may not be to some people's taste due to sexualised imagery.

I'm not a superhero fan, but the theme is perfect. Villains escaped the Asylum and you're trying to catch the biggest, baddest criminal masterminds. You win the round and a bat token if you collect the most valuable one, plus get bat tokens if your Batman captures villains other players are holding. Fast, knock'em out rounds make this a superb game. I don't know I'd always want to play it, but it's really that good.

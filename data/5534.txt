Small quick game, nice filler and something casual players can get into easy.  fits into  your pocket. Plays in 5 minutes.

Only problem I have with the game is if someone just places their cards down as fast as possible without any strategy or looking whatsoever. it really wrecks the game.

Trust your Geekbuddies.  Mine said Light Speed is good. I read the reviews and thought "is that all there is?".  Then I saw it in a games shop for just £3:50 and took a chance.  I was right; it's a very simple game.  My Geekbuddies were right too; it's a very enjoyable filler that's not quite like anything else in my collection.

A real-time card game.  Lay down cards as fast as you can draw them, to mine asteroids and shoot opponents!  Very fast and fun game, but once the cards are laid down, following the firing lines takes a while.  30 seconds to play, 5 minutes to figure out who won.

Real time space battles, WOOO-HOOO!!!! I had a great time playing this game, even though I lost handily. That's always a good sign. The game was especially humorous because we were using Agricola vegimeeples for the damage and asteroid tokens. One thing I would recommend is a laser level to do the LOS, it definitely makes things much easier!

It's a [i]really[/i] good game. It plays similar to Icehouse, and comparisons are inevitable. But Light Speed solves the analysis paralysis issues with Icehouse by requiring the cards be played in a given (random) order and that play stop as soon as one player is out of cards. I enjoy the game, and will gladly play.

About 30 seconds of fun followed by 10 minutes of work.  It reminds me of the battle portion of Neuroshima Hex, if you drew it out much longer, removed the strategy of tile placement, and made tile placement in real-time over 20 or so seconds.  Not horrible but not impressed overall.

Another fast energetic game by Tom Jolly. It's, sort of, speed Neuroshima Hex. Except it came out first, so I suppose one should really say Neuroshima Hex is an expanded but slow version of Light Speed:)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
While I usually dislike speed and dexterity games, Light Speed is an exception due to the higher level of strategy than is average in dexterity games.  It's a nice little filler game, and the fact that it works with 2-4 players is a handy bonus.  Simple, quick, and enjoyable; a winner.

RATING: 7
This is sort of like a card game version of that old "Space War" computer game (ancient)with a little "Asteroids" thrown in...all in real time!  It's a TON of fun to play and very addictive.  It gets a 10 for being the most bang for the buck I've ever spent on a game (it's usually about $5), for being the best 5 minute game I've ever played, and for breaking my record of plays in one night (33, breaking LOTR: The Confrontation's 25).  A better tabletop wargame than Warhammer 40K, Starfleet Battles, or any of that mess.

Flip your spaceship (cards) down fast because once someone has placed all of them, no one places more.  Try to point lasers to shoot at asteroids (for mining points) or other ships (damage points).  Protect your ships by showing other ships your shields.  A taut string or a long straight edge can help plot a line to see where a laser strikes.  Another fast, fun (and cheap) game from Cheapass.

RATING: 9
Fast, fun game. The scoring takes longer than actual gameplay, but it's neat to see how the battle falls out. The amount of tactical thinking involved really depends on who you're playing with; someone who just slaps down their cards as fast as they come up will force a more chaotic game than if everyone ponders before placement. Make sure to play on a non-slippery surface.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Production: Cool-looking spaceships.  The "shield" barriers should be more easily recognizable.  The game needs to be played on a non-slick surface, otherwise the cards seem to rotate of their own volition.  Play: The closest I've come to experiencing a video game while playing a board or card game.  The play is fast, evoking the feeling of a starship dogfight. And the combat resolution is interesting, with nothing turning out quite the way one plans.  Still, it's not really my type of game. (1+0+2) (2 plays)

Great idea for a light filler game, but oh so vulnerable to accidentally pushing a card out of position. I normally sleeve cards to protect them. In this case the sleeves should have a velcro back.

A very clever real-time game. The only problem is that the game is ruined if someone decides to simply slam all his cards down as fast as possible. They might not win, but they've managed to kill the fun for everyone else. And someone tries this "strategy" a bit too often.

It also takes MANY TIMES longer to figure out who won that to actually play the game.

Gotta be in the right mood to enjoy this one.  Can get a little frustrating and pointless when you have aggressive players who indiscriminently unload all of their ships around the asteroid.  Yes, you can pick 'em off from a safe distance, but they will usually outnumber your ships because they can place theirs down faster (less space to cover), and their asteroid points will offset any losses they endure.  This is a minor gripe, but it has ruined a few of our sessions.

(As of [b]9[/b] plays) A real-time pocket-sized space battle game. The rules are easy to learn and gameplay is fast and furious. The potentially tedious scoring round is infinitely improved by making "PEW! PEW!" noises while checking for hits. I don't love this as much as I think I should, but I generally enjoy it when it hits the table.

Holy blap!  This is FUN!!!

2P is decent, but 3 or 4 is a RIOT!

This is especially true when another player decides to play as fast as they can, but ends up shooting up themselves more than anyone else.

Only quibble: How is this a "Hip Pocket" game if you also need ~15 counters in each of 5 colors?!  That's a mighty big pocket!  (You'll also want a broken rubber band to measure lines-of-sight, but that fits well.)

Light Speed is probably the best Cheapass game I've played.  The real-time card play works beautifully, and is a perfect fit for the weight and theme of the game.  There's a little bit of thinking involved, but not too much to wreck the humor and adrenaline of the frantic play.  I don't know why we don't play this more often, it's refreshingly different than any other game in my collection.

This can be a fun little quick game.  It's a bit more reflex oriented (you want to play as quickly as possible) than I usually like.  Scoring takes a bit of time (usually more than the actual play time), but it can be amusing to see where stray lasers are heading.  Overall it's fun, but I can't get too into it or play it too often.

Printed this for free and supplied my own damage cubes. Really fun real-time real-space filler-- I think it's best with 4+ players and multiple asteroids, so that multiple areas of the table are contested.

I'm also tempted to try (but haven't yet) the mine-ore-from-ships variant, where damage you to do enemies accumulates on the attacking ship, and *that* ship still needs to survive for you to get the points. But I can imagine that game being tied at zero.

First played June 4th, 2007.  This is a quick learn and extremely quick play.  How fast?  You will spend way more time (2-3 min) counting your score than the 30-45 second game.  Make sure to get a long strait edge to see where your shots went.  It's a new twist type of game (new concept to me anyway) and is a very fun 2-4 filler game.  There's some skill and more luck.  However it's mostly to have fun and it excels at that.  I'd recommend playing this game if you manage to know someone who has it.  Or break out the $5 and buy it.

Jul08: My first real time CAG purchase.  And overall, quite a fun game.  It is entirely true that it takes about 5X as long to score as it does to play.  *But*, the scoring is actually rather fun.

I'm obviously really bad at it, but I do want to try it out in a multiplayer setting.

The game has a lot of interesting decisions crammed into the first 60 seconds, but you don't actually have to decide anything during the resolution.  We'll see how often I pull this out.

I'd compare it most to "Galaxy Trucker" of all things.  Not only in theme, but also in game play.

Fun and refreshing for a first few rounds, but then it becomes wearisome and tedious.  It's random too.

If I'm ever to play it again, it'll surely be not to 3 someone's wins - it would take waaaaaay too long.  It should be pre-set number of rounds played (and then scoring according to wins and/or points) or playing to someone's 2 wins.

Polish edition - colorful and 'luxurious', has the most annoying trait: way too few damage counters for players (and color of them for the violet player is mixed up too).

Fun, novel and QUICK game. As you have to play so quick, there is almost no strategy, however the game offers a lot of laughs. It can be explained under 2 minutes and played under 15 minutes. I feel the second part (scoring phase) to be a little boring after the quick gameplay :S 

I want to get it just for the novel mechanics. Perhaps with more plays this can go up in my ratings.

There'd be fewer disputes if the lasers went all the way across the cards, or if there were targeting dots on the card edges, and if the shields were printed to the edge, but we're pretty easygoing, so it's not a huge deal.  (Besides, it was Cheap!)

RATING: N/A
Light Speed is a lightning-fast card game of space combat about identical teams of spaceships dropping out of hyperspace to do battle over an extremely important asteroid. Each spaceship is equipped with 1 to 4 lasers, and the lasers have 3 different "strengths"

The game is played in two stages. In the "fast round" players play their cards onto a table, trying to position them so that their laser beams will hit either the asteroid (and thereby "mining" it) or other players (causing them damage). Once one player has gotten rid of all of their cards, the "scoring round" begins.

In the Scoring round, all ships of the same rank will fire at the same time. (All "1" ships will fire, then all "2" ships, etc.) If, after all the ships of the same rank have fired, a ship has more damage than it does Health, the ship is destroyed. Play continues through the ranks 1-10. Once all ships have fired, players receive 1 point for each point of health they took from their opponent, plus one point for each successful "mining" of the asteroid.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
[2010.Dec.03] A fast game that plays quickly and brings nothing in the way of forward thinking and deep strategic play. This is all about flopping cards on the table as quickly as you can. With the right players, this can be a fun and enjoyable romp that serves up plenty of trash-talking opportunities.

RATING: 6
Although real-time games aren't my cup of tea, I'd rate Light Speed quite a bit higher if it wasn't for one significant problem. After all, what's not to like about a game that features interesting decisions in a 5-10 minute package?

And, indeed, the system of Light Speed is nice and straightforward, and does, in fact, generate some interesting decisions, even though it boils down to "blast stuff and try not to get blasted."

The problem is that it takes significantly longer to score the game than it does to play it. Line of sight, even when it can be resolved quickly, eats up a bit of time, and so does having to go through the ships in a specified order, since you have to be sure you got all of the ships of type one before you move on to type two.

If scoring was as fast as play, I'd rate this a nine, maybe even a ten.

DEXTERITY GAME?  REAL TIME.
No box.  It comes in a little baggy that can fit in your pocket.

Players throw down cards really fast in real time, trying to be the first to throw all their cards on the table.  Then you check the orientation of all cards to see what they are shooting at and resolve each shot in a particular order.  Some ships have shields and can only be hit from particular angles.

It takes some practice to get good at it.

RATING: 6
Not bad. Takes the idea of the classic game, Speed, and makes it a little more interesting. It uses a similar concept as Neuroshima Hex with its combat, though I think it works better here just because in NH it becomes more of an optimization exercise. I like that the game can accommodate those who want to try to strategically place ships and those who just want to throw down cards without giving their opponent(s) a chance. There isn't a lot to the game, unfortunately, so I can't rate it higher. It's fine for a quick and simple game, but nothing too spectacular.

RATING: 6
Fun and fast- plays in 30 seconds, scores in a minute or 2 after.  'That game with the string'.  Dexterity aspect in positioning ships.  I've only played 2 players, and most games end with all of one player's ships on the board, and the opponent missing several.  The fact that it's usually the same person in each situation reduces the games re-playability.   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Although it may very well have inspired the game that it now lives under the shadow of, when played turn-based as a tutorial, Light Speed is the poor man's Neuroshima Hex, with far less interesting units and a more neurotic focus on miniature wargaming measurements of hitboxes. When its actual ruleset is enabled, it suddenly transmutes into a chaos simulator, even with 2 players. If you find enjoyment in pulling a surprise winner from slowly resolving a situation your brain simply couldn't handle during gameplay, take a look at this title. If however you expect anything resembling real-time strategy, you might want to pass.

RATING: 6
I liked it more than my sons did--the older one wandered off as soon as game play stopped and scoring began. I think the design is quite clever, but hand-scoring is problematic. Therefore, it seems to me this is a better 2-player game, simply because the scoring is easier to track with two. On the other hand, this might work better as a computer game because a computer could score the game in seconds, whereas doing so manually is a real chore, and, as in my experience, the risk is that you lose your audience during the scoring phase. Still, it's a great idea for a game, and fun. Although I parted with it because I wasn't able to find other players, I still think it could be a hit as an app or video game.

Nice and simple party game. Mostly chaotic and random but funny. All the action takes place in first minute or less and than you only check how much damage you did to other player's ships (or even your's own ships). Good filler and thats all.

The disadvantage of the game is too small amount of markers to mark damage done to other ships especially if you don't have too many other board games to borrow some.

There is also free (print and play) extension available for polish eddition called The Convoy, which i must try.

I usually dislike realtime games, and I usually dislike games with continuous measurement instead of discrete grids. So it was quite nice that I actually enjoyed this realtime game with continuous measurement! It's fast fun and quite clever.

Occasional inevitable problematic ambiguities about whether a ship hit another arise.

Light Speed inspired the Looney pyramid game Torpedo which nicely has simpler scoring.

Edit: It's also almost completely random, so if you don't like that...

Light Speed is a lightning-fast card game of space combat about identical teams of spaceships dropping out of hyperspace to do battle over an extremely important asteroid. Each spaceship is equipped with 1 to 4 lasers, and the lasers have 3 different "strengths"

The game is played in two stages. In the "fast round" players play their cards onto a table, trying to position them so that their laser beams will hit either the asteroid (and thereby "mining" it) or other players (causing them damage). Once one player has gotten rid of all of their cards, the "scoring round" begins. In the Scoring round, all ships of the same rank will fire at the same time. (All "1" ships will fire, then all "2" ships, etc.) If, after all the ships of the same rank have fired, a ship has more damage than it does Health, the ship is destroyed. Play continues through the ranks 1-10. Once all ships have fired, players receive 1 point for each point of health they took from their opponent, plus one point for each successful "mining" of the asteroid. Light Speed is part of the Hip Pocket Games series.

This was a blast!  We played once with the regular rules and then the big asteroid and piracy variants.  We then came up with a bunch of variants of our own to try, and I think that's part of what made the game so entertaining.  It was a lot of fun to try to come up with zany new ideas.

Best hippocket-games. Realtime cardgame at it&#039;s best. And yes a broken rubber-band is needed to play.

It's a very interesting real-time game but it gets old really quickly. My 11 yr old absolutely loves this game though! I plan to try the 20 minute variant. I'm sure the strategy will help.

I didn't realize it doesn't come w/ all the pieces you need to play the game. I can't really complain for the price..but I'm glad I had something on hand to use as damage counters.

Strange original game that lasts 30 second and then you have 10 minutes scoring and nonetheless it's fun... i mean, also the scoring part is fun! (provided you don't play against people devoided of any fairplay that will complaint against every decision)

Components are quite horrible and probably will be unusable after a few wild games but the idea itself is great. I think it must be tons of fun with kids too! I want this!

The fun part lasts for 30 seconds and the tedious part lasts for 5 minutes.  Also, people can break the game by slapping down ships at random as quickly as possible.

quick, fun, and different every time. it's as much about dexterity as it is about lightning-fast strategizing, which makes it enjoyable over and over again.

Surprisingly fun game. Very rules light, but the real-time aspect makes it pretty entertaining. Only takes about 10 minutes to play, would probably get really interesting with 4 players.

(TRADE Interest: medium) hey, for a cheapass game, this is quite a blast.  furiously paced. i never once was able to lay down all my cards -- though i did win once.

I don't like the game as well as Brawl, because of the complicated scoring at the end. But as a quickie game-filler it's great, despite the game's frenetic pace leaving me twitchy.

A fizzy blast of space combat. I just wish the scoring was automatic. Must buy myself a robot.

Light Speed is a real-time card game that is good, wacky fun. It's loud, stressful, but also laugh out loud funny. The fact that you shuffle up your ten ships prior to the start of the game and then draw and play one ship at a time, while also knowing that as soon as any other player is done playing all ten cards, the round is over and you cannot play any more, translates into quite a lot of chaos.

Luckily chaos is quite alright in a funny 10-minute game with an interesting theme. This is a great beer and pretzels game.

Игра не без раздумий, но при этом с полным отсутствием AP достойна наивысшей оценки... Были бы ещё карты покачественнее.

This not the kind of game you'd play for hours BUT it is difficult to get more excitement out of a 45 seconds game and more tension in the 5 minutes of resolution. Very simple and clever design.

After 5+ Plays: A really neat idea for a game, and a surprising amount of strategy for a real-time game.  The biggest problem is the scoring, which not only takes longer than the game itself, but can be a rather inexact science.

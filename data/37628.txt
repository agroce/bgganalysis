130929 I would prefer to play some of the other 3P climbing games out there like Da San and Dou Dizhu but if the other two guys want a heavy climbing game, I'd certainly play Haggis.  But again, not interested in purchasing it.

101230 Interesting 5-suited game.  I don't like the scoring but I do love the play.  Would purchase if I thought the card quality would withstand heavy usage.  Check out my review of the game as well as the proposed scoring variant in the forums.

Climbing game somewhat reminiscent of Tichu, but with a feel of it's own - each player starts with multiple potential bombs, which gives the game an engaging "chicken" aspect. Bombs also have their downside, which complicates their potential use.  Only played 3p so far.

I really enjoy playing Haggis with my wife. It's a game we can both be competitive at and it plays at the right pace. I actually think this is a better managed game than Tichu to which it owes alot. I truly love the face up wild cards as a decision point - followed up by the low and high in-hand bombs - brilliant! For a fairly meaty, but classic card game, this is my favorite for two.

I know the designer of this game.  I enjoy two player card games and there are not that many around (that I know of).  This one is neat in that it incorporates aspects of Tichu, but has evolved into its own.  Sometimes you have to play to minimize your hand even if it's not the best play, because you know your opponent will go out first.  Also, the three wild cards make it so that it's difficult to go out first

[2-3] Traditional card games and I have a rocky relationship.  Usually, I'm taught the game right before I play and every game is a brutal learning experience where I fumble around while everyone else seems to have a great time.  However, my wife is one of those that enjoy a traditional card game....  

Haggis lets us meet right in the middle.  To me, it's customized just enough that it doesn't feel like I'm playing with a standard deck of cards and for her, it feels incredibly familiar.  The art and production is beautiful.  And as far as trick taking games go, I really like the flow of this for 2p where partners aren't necessary.  There's a speed and elegance to it which is perfect for us.  It'll probably end up our most played card game!

Edit: Months later, we still love the game but the quality of the cards is terrible. They begin to fold on themselves by the third or fourth play and only go south from there. Bummer for an otherwise nice game.

This game is very close to Tichu, it has it's differences and the most important one is that it works proper in 3 players. I enjoy Tichu a lot, but it plays proper only with 4 players, so Haggis is a decent choice to play this kind of game when you are on 3 players.

Seemed to be a reasonably worthy variant of Tichu that played nicely with three players.  Basically, the goal is to get rid of your cards first, and in so doing, collect the most cards with point values on them.  As in Tichu, a type of betting on the outcome of the round is allowed at the beginning of each round.  

The clever twist in this game is the use of the three wild cards that everyone starts each round with.  That mechanic felt the most interesting to me.  Have only 3 players and want to play Tichu?  This would do the trick.

Another climbing trick-taker with lovely artwork, you score based on the stuff left in your opponent(s) hands, and there are a large variety of combos that can be dropped on top of others, with a 'bomb' similar to Tichu.

One of the best trick-playing games I own. Love the mechanic where players are punished for playing bombs, as it is new and relevant in a player's decision. Furthermore, the number of strategies a player can implement can be mind numbing. And don't let a card-drawing game fool you... the fact each player starts out with a bomb limits luck and makes this game have a strong component of skill.

Finally, the components are some of the best I've seen in a card game and the theme is aesthetically pleasing. Certainly a game you could bring to the table for anyone to play.

After playing Go Fish with my father and brother as a kid, I moved on to ... well nothing. Played Hearts on the PC once or twice, and Poker in university a couple of times (quite badly).

So I kind of approach this game, a ladder climbing game for 2 or 3 players, with a measure of apprehension. Yet, it wasn't so bad; in fact, I'm quite charmed by this game. It's not complicated (compared to some traditional card games, like Cribbage), and there's probably a lot of strategy once you remember the possible combinations.

I probably be on the lookout for this game in the future.

An interesting card game that gives you lots to think about while still being rules-light. It's deeper than games like Hearts or Spades but much more accessible than Tichu (which this game is derived from). The fact that everyone always has the same wild cards available is a great mechanic. It evens out the power balance and causes you to always have to play around possible bombs while still giving you lots of flexibility.

The more I play this game, the more I like it.  It's just a really fun well balanced game.  Updated my rating to reflect this.

One of the things that I really like about Haggis, is the obvious tension that exists in the game.  Trying to create a solid plan around your hand, only having to adapt as your opponent always messes up your plan, makes for great gameplay.  Another design choice that I think is quite strong was the decision to equalize the wild/bomb cards.  In a game of Big Two/ Tichu, a player can be at an extreme disadvantage without any special cards.  In Haggis a poor hand can put you at a disadvantage, but it's nice to know that you always have some wilds/bombs to work with.

Well done Sean!

This was my first exposure to climbing games, I think it served it's purpose as a gateway, but man did it hurt along the way. I'm still pretty sure I'm a mediocre to poor player at this point, mind you. One player in our group has more cardgame experience than the rest and he tends to do pretty well, although he doesn't win every time. The bidding can lead to some significant swings and there is a decent amount of luck in the game. I find the original rules, although they might not be ideal for tournament play very clever and work well as a catchup mechanism. The base scoring for this game already has a nice, I hesitate to use the word but ok, "organic" feeling to them. The card play with regards to scoring has a really nice ebb and flow to it as players bomb cards and push the trick to their opponents score pile. 

Right now, I bid too often. I find myself in a unique game theory predicament. Wanting to "feel" the game out, more specifically the bidding, card play and the pacing of the shedding (if that makes sense), but I am more apt to make mistakes. If I was playing for my life (or money) I would bid less often, but right now the outcomes of hands and their progressions still yield quite a few surprises. Did I mention this is my first climbing game? ha! I hope to get a few more games of Tichu in so I can start to wrap my mind around some of their more subtle differences. 

This game is a massive brain-burner for me. As far as traditional-type card games go, albeit I'm inexperienced, it is really deep. Upon first plays awhile back I was a little stunned how multifaceted the decisions during the card play are. It opened my mind about card games, put a lot of new games on my radar after further research. Sean did a great job developing the game taking into account the history of the genre from what I see from rulesets from Tichu and other standard deck climbers.

I slightly prefer the game with two players as the 3P game gets a little chaotic and just a little weird with how the bets "feel" (I guess there's nothing really wrong with the scoring) and how the bombed tricks are divvy'd. (altho as mentioned I kind of like it a little as a catchup) Without having played Tichu much (I can tell I'll enjoy that a lot too, especially the partnership element) and despite being taken by the wonderful trick taker 99 by David Parlett this is currently my favorite traditional-type card game with 99 coming in a very close second.

Building card game with some bidding involved that actually works for three. It works because of the three facecards every player gets each turn. These let you make great combinations and bombs. But if you use them too soon you may not be able to get back into the hand. Very simple and clever design.

I don't like Tichu, and Tichu certainly doesn't like me.  My brain doesn't seem to grok how to win Tichu (which I'm sure is part of that game's appeal).  I understand getting out early is a good thing, but when I manage it I find I didn't collect many points along the way; conversely, if I go out of my way to collect points then I'm sure to finish last.  Either way, I lose, and moreover, my [i]partner[/i] loses too, so there's that extra stress too.  So, no, I don't like Tichu.

While Haggis is similar, I definitely like it more than Tichu.  For starters, going out first is pretty much always good -- the points you get are higher than what you tend to collect during the hand.  So that single goal, that both players share, makes it more straightforward to grok.  And I like the lack of partnership, so even if I do poorly, I'm not letting anyone else down with my poor play.

So, better than Tichu, for me.

I was a bit surprised however that my wife, who loves Tichu, really REALLY doesn't like Haggis.  She is Chinese and has played many Chinese-style climbing games, like Tractor and Dou Di Zhu.  Tichu is very directly derived from those games and is easy for someone who has played those to understand.  Haggis, which breaks some of the conventions of those types of games, felt very contrived and unintuitive (her words).  Reading some of the developmental history of Haggis, "contrived" is probably a fair description, what with the computer models and the like.  It didn't feel natural to her, though I had no such preconceptions.

But I like Haggis OK.  I prefer it with three players over two, but for three I'd also strongly recommend Dou Di Zhu, especially you like the partnership aspect of Tichu.

An excellent two player climbing card game.  Pretty simple but with tough choices to make, especially with the betting and wild card play.  I was pleasantly surprised by it.  Playing to 350 can be a bit long for some but it worked well for me.  It gives a chance for hands to even out, I think.  I have not played Tichu but apparently this is a 2-3 player version of it.  Looking forward to trying this with three.  

Update: March 2012.  I'm giving this a 9.  It is rare feat indeed to find a two player card game that is as deep as this.  I know I'm going to have to get a second copy for down the road. I do not want to play this with regular cards (even though I can).  Really an awesome card game.

I bought a copy because I thought that Haggis was like Tichu but suitable for two or three players (my wife loves Tichu but we only can play it if we are 4). But it's more fiddly and unnecesary overcomplicated compared with Tichu.

Traded away. Reason: I prefer wait to be 4 players for playing Tichu and meanwhile play another thing when we are 2 or 3 players. 

I'm not saying Haggis it's a bad game, but it wasn't what I was looking for.

Caveat: I am not into trick taking and climbing games, hence the rating. However, this is a wonderfully produced game (beautiful cards) that fills a specific niche: 3-player games. I can see people who like this sort of games easily giving Haggis a rating of 8 or higher.

Played Haggis with a modified Sticheln deck and the game worked nicely. If you want to play climbing game with 2-3 players here's a great choice for you. Whether this game is even close of being Tichu for 2-3 remains to be seen after some more plays but I have to say that I really miss the partnership in Haggis compared to Tichu.

RATING: 10
I never thought I'd love a card game as much as I love Haggis.  I never thought I'd play a climbing game that works well with 2.  These are just some of the firsts that Haggis represents for me.

I played Tichu not long before I acquired this, and was very intrigued.  I liked the trick-style play, but the climbing element added a lot of push-your-luck style tension.  Too bad you needed at least 3, eh?  Well, enter Haggis.  Haggis makes climbing possible for 2 with the use of some creative bombs.  Basically, whenever face cards are used without number cards, they are some kind of bomb, and there are 5 total bombs that can be played.  Because the deck is smaller, and you only have one opponent, it is much more possible to tease out what cards your opponent likely has, and to play accordingly.  This leads to some very tense, tactical play, as you try to draw out cards you want them to play so you can make your run.  And it is oh so satisfying when you do manage to sequence something very well and are able to go out bam bam bam.  Yes, this is great stuff.  If you like card games, get this.  If you like climbing games, get this.  If you like 2 player games... well, you get the picture.  Get this one.  It is cheap, and well worth it.

Three player trick taking and/or ladder games are rare. Great 3-player trick taking games are almost non-existent. The Bottle Imp and 9-5-2 are the only two that come to mind (both great games). There is now a third on the block. This is a fabulous game. And as a complete, awesome bonus? It plays 2-player just as well! I've only played this a handful of times so far, but I can already tell it's going to be one of my all time favorites.

RATING: 7
Takes a few hands to wrap your brain around (which is a good thing!), but once it starts clicking this is a really good little ladder game, especially since it's made for 2-3 players, which is a rarity for the genre.

The twist here is that each player has 3 wild cards face up in front of them, and there are a ton of possible combos to play, so deciding how to approach a hand can hurt your brain a little as there are so many possibilities.

The other twist is that not all cards are in play.  There are a few cards in the "Haggis", so while you can count cards, you're never sure what's in the Haggis and out of play.

Some cards are worth points if you take the trick, and when you go out, you get 5 points per card in the hand of the player with the most cards left.  Play to a set number of points.

Overall, just a really good ladder trick taker with enough twists to make it different enough.  Probably my #1 game in the genre now for when there is 3.

Played it a month after buying it.  I love that it fits 3 players so well and that you have such great decisions to make with the cards given.  It obviously comes down to some luck and some skill.

How complicated a game can you make with naught but a standard French deck? Pretty complicated as it turns out. 

Between the betting, being able to strongly guess at what cards the opponent has, your three wilds, and the scoring of cards remaining in hand, there is potential for huge hands. Huge. The penalty for misplay here is higher than in most climbing games, and thus the need to properly evaluate your hand is even greater.

Actually has more similarities to Tichu than I expected. Not really a bad thing in this case since it's played with 2-3 instead of the strict 4.

It takes several plays to even begin to strategize well. Learning how to break up your hand and even organize your cards is DIFFICULT. More difficult than Tichu, I'd say.

I dig the wild card system. It adds some tension to each hand KNOWING that your opponent(s) all have bombs and getting to see which wild cards they haven't used yet.

RATING: 6
This is "Asshole" for two players.  The wild cards and the bombs is the twist needed to make this work.  Fortunately, I liked playing "Asshole" and we would play in a group up to 10 with two decks of cards and the asshole would have to wear a beekeepers net and a life preserver.

This is a good game to kill time on an airplane.  Maybe you can get the person in the aisle seat to join you.

I liked this just as much as tichu, and probably a bit more since the number of bombs that can be played is known and must be planned for - the randomness of bombs is probably the thing I like least about Tichu. Plus, I like that its not a partners game. The decisions surrounding the 3 wild cards and how to play them is interesting. The 3-player has a little bit of kingmaker with the bombs, but nothing excessive. I need a few more plays to see how it holds up, liking it a lot right now.

Good fun and a good filler. The fact that you have to keep running scores though makes this a little less than ideal - especially if you only have time to play a few rounds.

RATING: 7
Well I'll be darned, it's a 2-3 player card game that captures the feel of Tichu! I had played Tichu just a bit before receiving this game as a gift from a friend, and I had no idea what my wife would think about it. But, after a couple of plays, the game really clicked for both of us, and my wife proceeded to stomp me with some regularity.

Haggis is a very enjoyable trick-taking/climbing game for two. It's also incredibly portable. I still slightly prefer Tichu because of the partnerships, but this will do in a pinch. My only knock on the game is that, after 20+ plays, our copy shows significant wear and creasing on the cards, which is a bit disappointing.

Update: played the game 20+ times as a two player, and finally got a chance to play it with three. Very solid, and I like it even slightly better with three. It is The Tichu Substitute when you have only two or three people.

:indigo: There's some strong resemblance to Tichu here but it's definitely not a simple case of bolting on a two player mode to the predecessor game. It's really delightfully simple rules-wise but there is very rarely a self-evident/trivial decision to make. Haggis very cleverly makes metaphor meet reality by running with the idea of a "bomb." Every player is dealt three face cards, which can be used for their traditional values, as wilds, or as components of a bomb, which in Tichu fashion trumps all other hands -- each trick is a little bit of Kissingerian brinksmanship where you escalate and escalate until someone backs down or someone drops The Big One -- but often (not always) you're better off using the threat of the bomb to get your way without all of that ugliness.

This is a smart, well-designed bit of gaming goodness. Nice design on the cards, as well, though you could probably just play with a standard deck in a pinch.

It appears that I've only logged 4 plays (as of Mar 2015) with my physical copy of the game. Yet, I've already purchased a backup copy for whenever this one wears out. Also, I've played dozens and dozens, if not one hundred, games of Haggis on the iOS app. This game is straight-up brilliant. Once someone understands that it is a climbing game, then it is accessible from the first play. But it also rewards repeated play. What a great game.

An interesting ladder style trick taking game. The scoring on particular cards and bombing resulting in giving away the cards from the trick make for some interesting play decisions as do the face wild cards. There's a bit of Gang of Four, a bit of Tichu but it makes you think quite differently. I'm looking forward to more plays and I'm happy I picked it up for my wife and I. Based on 1 two-player game.

I'm probably going to need to revisit this rating as my opponent was not having a good time after getting hosed early on (I had a round where I placed a big bet and went out before he had a chance to play anything scoring his entire hand and the haggis taking 57 points). There were some learns for both of us, and he can see what he should have done differently. This didn't make the experience enjoyable for him though. I think that this warrants repeated play.

This is a ladder card game, where you lead off with a set of some type, and the next player must one-up you or pass.  The twist here is you must match the exact type of set - so if player 1 lays down three 4s, then player 2 must lay down three 5s or greater (but not two or four of a kind).  This gives the leader on each trick a measure of control, which is a key facet of the game.

A second factor here are the Jack, Queen, King, which are not suited and serve as wild cards.  Also, not every number is worth points at the end of a trick - only the 3, 5, 7, 9 in each suit.  Lastly there is the twist of a "bomb" which is a particular arrangement of cards which trumps any other set, and forces the following player to play a better bomb.  On top of it all, players must make a "little bet" or "big bet" at the start of the hand if they want to score the big points.

Our first play (two-player) was...fine.  But not terribly exciting.  And after playing for well over an hour, we were tied and called it.  My understanding is this game works well with three players, and I'm willing to give it another go with that number.  Also I have to bring up the issue that the cards themselves looked lovely, but bent too easily, and after one game we've got a number of cards with a bend in the middle.  Granted, the game was cheap, so I shouldn't complain.

I'm not sure how to correctly rate this yet.  I have played it just a few times, with 2 and with 3 players.  It works great as a Tichu alternative when we don't have a foursome.  However, we're not quite comfortable with the flow of the game yet, so we're spending time referring to the reference cards and rules instead of just enjoying the game.  So right now it doesn't deserve the 8 I'm giving it, but in all honesty I'm concerned that the 8 might not be high enough.  It seems like it's going to be at least that, probably better.

Inevitable to be compared to Tichu.  Missing the card passing mechanic, and bombs are seen much more frequently.  Worth owning and playing as a climbing game that works well with 2 and 3 players. Lacking the stress of not wanting to let down your partner that Tichu offers. Other than that, it works very well as an alternative when 4 players aren't available. On the plus side, it plays quicker and doesn't overstay its welcome.

A perfectly fine game that I'd be willing to play whenever anyone wanted.  However, if I have four players and want to do this I'm going to play Tichu, and if I have three players and want a card game it's always Cosmic Eidex.  So I don't see myself having a great call for it.  Plus, the passing aspect of Tichu is one of my favorite parts of one of my favorite games.  So this game, being so similar in so many ways, lost a lot by not including that in the port.

As good of a 2 player game as Tichu is a 4 player one. I prefer 4 player games, hence my higher rating for Tichu but that takes absolutely nothing away from Haggis. A great, strategic, EXCRUCIATINGLY tense card game.

Shedding game with some twists in scoring/wild cards.
Doesn't hit the table as often as I would like.  Probably because you need a "dedicated partner(s)" to really dig into the game with you. 

Not a fan of the drab colors/suit designs which seems to make it more difficult to distinguish between them than necessary.

I have come to the conclusion that I just simply have an odd aversion to trick taking and climbing games. While I appreciate their quality, and understand the enjoyment that others derive from them, they just don’t work for me. Haggis seemed to work perfectly fine as such a game, and it was clear my opponents enjoyed themselves, so Haggis might very well be a good climbing game. I just have no basis for making that conclusion myself. I rate it a 5.

RATING: 6
Two or three player card game where players are playing cards to "tricks" that escalate.  Tricks must follow the lead which can be sets of a kind or straights of the same suit. Three wild cards for each player heighten the strategy and the tension. Players also have the ability to play a trump meld, called a bomb, to force a win. This retains the lead but hands points to your opponent. Points are scored for certain won cards in tricks, as well as for catching your opponent with cards in hand. Great game, works well. Lots to consider.

Sometimes described as Tichu for 2-3 players, Haggis plays differently. While it's true that Haggis is also a climbing game, there are many factors that set it apart from Tichu:

1. Tichu is a partnership game; Haggis isn't
2. The deck has five suits instead of only four, with the suits being numbered from 2 to 10 (instead of 2 thru A).
3. Suits matter in Haggis; in Tichu, they don't.
4. Every player is given three wild cards at the start of the game that are worth points when taken. These can also be saved and used as bombs
5. Tricks won by bombs must be given away to opponents, and bombs cannot be played out of turn.
6. Extra points are awarded based on the number of cards remaining in opponents' hands.
7. Game has seven/three cards that make up an unknown "pot" that is awarded to the first player to go out.  
8. Bets are handled differently
9. Straights can contain as few as three cards, but must also be flushes

Don't like Haggis quite as much as Tichu, but it is very, very good. Haven't played as a 2p, but want to give it a try.

RATING: 6
Very solid ladder-climbing game for 3 players.   You can play with 2... but why?   So many better choices for 2, it would seem.   Anyway, the core element of this game revolves around the J-Q-K that everybody starts with (face-up) and the ways that these can be used as bombs.  Bombed tricks have to be given away.   The play is tense and timing is critical.   It's a really good alternative to Tichu (which, frankly, I'm starting to get sick of after 50+ plays and is IMHO over-rated).   Nice game.

RATING: N/A
It feels very much like a "response" to Tichu.  In Tichu, the general goal is to set up an unbreakable "combo" of cards, hoping that your opponents don't have the "combo-breaker" necessary to stop you.  In Haggis, your opponents are always guaranteed to have a combo-breaker, meaning it's nearly impossible to just run to the finish.  It's interesting.  Rating pending.

Purchased to play in the hospital while recovering from the birth of my son.  First playthrough had me loving the game; the bombs were silly but really an excellent tool to try to regain control of the game.  Once we played a second game to 250, my husband made an excellent point that pretty much 'broke' the game for us.  If it is your turn to lead, why wouldn't you go for the big bet?  We both were able to get at times almost 90 points in one hand consistently.  For a game you play to 250, it seemed to be over after three or four rounds at the most and basically came down to whomever got to go first more that game was the winner.  Bombs become less useful if your opponent is lucky enough to lead with a five card run or someting ridiculous like that.

This is an interesting climbing game for two or three players.  If you like Tichu, then it's said that you will like this one as well.  I can't really comment as I haven't played Tichu yet.  Despite getting rid of Haggis, I still have interest in trying Tichu just because of the partnership dynamic.  I like Haggis and think it's a very well designed game, but sadly I tend to prefer 2 player card games with card powers (ie Ascension, RftG, Seasons, etc).  You do owe it to yourself to try this if you like trick-taking/climbing games.

I really like this game for its thrust and parry play. Hand control and sequencing rule the day. The wonderful twist in the game design is that in the supreme moment of aggression (the "bomb"), you must give all the points in the hand away in order to take the lead. How nice is that!

RATING: 3
This may chalk up to my inexperience, but Haggis is a very strange game. In most ladder climbing games, it makes strategical sense to play weak cards early and 'climb' from there. But in Haggis, players are confined to one exact set-type each round, which I find very restrictive and dull. Instead of climbing, it feels as though players descend the ladder, which leaves the game feeling flat rather than having an escalating sense of tension.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
How and when to use the three open wild cards really makes this game shine and gives players great flexibility with their hand of cards.  Using bombs gives your opponent(s) a decent amount of points, but just like Tichu, going out first still seems ideal since you get points for the cards that are left in the hands of your opponents.  Attaining that leverage to go out first is a tense and stressful affair in the best way possible.  Thanks for creating a Tichu experience without the need for partners.

Why don't I like this game? I should, by all rights. Maybe the aesthetics don't sit with me? I don't know, but I don't really care for it. Game arrived damaged - but I really use it as my example for why games should be handled with care. As a game, it serves no purpose. As an example to "have the drinks off the table and STOP bending those cards!" it is invaluable to my collection, and lives in the overnight bag.

RATING: 5
This is a game that is proclaimed to be a Tichu for two players game in a lot of different forums. It is a climbing game, yes. But IMO it lacks most of Tichu's interest. First of all, it's obviously not a partnership game. No partner, no Tichu. Also, the Haggis, or the cards left face down out of play, drive me crazy. I like the procedural aspect of Tichu. I enjoy knowing that since I've seen 2 aces and the phoenix come out, and I passed my partner another ace, I know my pair of kings is safe to win a hand. In Haggis this is always going to be a gamble. That procedure is a part of Tichu that requires a lot of concentration, and since it's never certain in Haggis I'd wager that this concentration is not required to such a high degree to play Haggis well. 

Now, I don't necessarily think this is a bad game. It seems well designed, (now here's where the huge but comes in) BUT it's not a game for me.

This is a unique game and the more I figure it out the more I like it. It's hard to get to the table with gamers who are turned off by traditional card games, but non-gamers who play cards pick it up pretty well. The graphic design of the cards & packaging is great. I deducted a point because of the very frequent complaints of low quality cards that are easily significantly damaged. My copy is fine for now, but I don't want to have to worry about that when I'm playing.

This card game is similar to Tichu or Gang of Four, but for 2-3 people instead of four.

The rules are a little sketchy and needed clarification here on BGG.

Betting is used instead of calling Grand Tichu or Tichu, and there are 3 wild cards instead of Phoenix, Dragons, etc.  Bombs are present and combinations & sequences are similar.  Bombs (with high points) are handed to an opponent after the trick is won. Scoring is more like Pinochle.  I have not played Zheng Fen and Big Two, and this card game is evidently in the family--perhaps the scoring more resembles these.

The wild cards are double sided--a very nice feature because they need to be kept separate.  Cards are are stiff and hard to shuffle.  

I will probably increase the rating, but at this time am not sure if I like the wild card mechanics which give everyone the ability to bomb--certainly reduces a luck factor present in Tichu.

Played with 2 players and its just not my cup of thea. A lot of cards to hold in your hand and multiple ways of playing them makes it really difficult to determine which way you can get rid of them as soon as possible.

Trick climbing game for 2-3 players.   Clever card play as you attempt to go out first.   You can also bet on your own success before you play your first cards for additional points but if you fail, your opponents gets those points.   Wild cards have two uses, standard wild card or to be combined into "bombs" which allow you to win tricks you'd lose otherwise.  Feels like a game my grandfather could have taught me.  My rating reflects the 2p game, I don't like it as much with 3p.

Trick-taking games for two usually suck royally.  This, however, is just perfect.

As a Tichu fanatic, it's interesting just how differently Haggis plays. The strategies and patterns and principles that work for Tichu don't necessarily apply to Haggis. In addition to their randomly-dealt hand, each player also starts with the same three powerful cards: an unsuited Jack, Queen, and King. These can be played as high singleton cards, wild cards, or two or three of them in combination as a bomb. Knowing how and when to use these three cards is the most intriguing and most difficult part of Haggis. There is often a game of brinksmanship surrounding these face cards. Once you've used them, you're usually in a weak position, so players will often try to hold them for as long as possible.

Haggis was originally designed as a two-player game, and then adapted to also work with three players. The two-player game is a bit cleaner and a bit better in my estimation. It's also very enjoyable with three, but in that format it often becomes more of a political game with a great deal of kingmaking.

The bottom line is: if you're an admirer of Tichu, then you need to give Haggis a taste. It's an ambitious and well-crafted game that does much more than just try to simulate Tichu for two or three players.

Hands down my favorite card game, and my most played game by far. Comparisons with Tichu are not fair, since this game feels completely different than the former (even though I enjoy both). 

Hand management at its best, tough decisions on every card played, tight score, tension throughout the game. This game shines over other climbing games due to the combination of the following factors:

- Wild cards (and bombs) are open information;
- Bombed tricks are given to the opponents;
- Bombs use the wild cards and scoring cards.

Add to it the betting system and the points you get for the remaining cards in the opponent's hands and you have an incredibly clever card play every turn.

----------------

Update 03/13 - OK, after +- 150-170 plays, I think I got worn out of this game. I still enjoy playing it as a social event, but it kind of goes on autopilot now (maybe because I always play with the same people). Still, for a deck of cards, 150 plays is a lot! Downgrading the rating to a 9.

Lovely implementation of a Tichu style card game for 2-3 players. The reworked bomb system is genius and results in some brutally difficult decisions throughout the game. This is accompanied by a much more significant benefit for going out first. These redesign decisions not only make it playable with 2-3 but also make it feel different enough that it requires its own unique strategies and approaches. I do miss the partnership aspect of Tichu, but when I am looking for a climbing, trick taking game I will never be sad to play Haggis if we don't have 4.

I think I like the game a BIT more with 2 than 3. With 3, the odds of playing any runs without the assistance of a wild is very low. This makes hand management all about deciding whether to play cards as singles, pairs, trios... I found that this made the 'puzzle' aspect of figuring out how I wanted to play my card combinations less interesting. Still great though, and the added interaction of a 3rd player is great.

Fun with two, not as much with three. A quality note: so much care went into making these cards strong and beautiful that they turned out brittle: after 6 or 7 games they cracked in half (at least with our deck). Now we just play with a standard deck or cards.

This is a great climbing game similar to Tichu, but for 2 players. Though it accommodates 3, right now I'd only recommend it for 2.

The key to this one is clearing out your hand as quickly as possible. This means arranging cards into (hopefully) unbeatable combos and using bombs to take control whenever possible.

Played quickly, this is a great filler for two when you don't have enough for Tichu.

RATING: 8
Having played a lot of Tichu it was both easy and hard to adjust to playing Haggis. A lot of concepts are the same but there are some slight differences that took me a while to get used to. After one play I definitely have no idea of what is a good hand and what is a bad hand and so betting is difficult. It seems like there`s more to think about than Tichu, especially with the three wild cards. Trying to draw your opponents bombs out seems to be the key to victory.

It's hard to get too excited about a trick taking card game, but this is a good one. I'm always looking for decent games that I can convince people too play at family gatherings, and this one might work. It's not too daunting to learn, but there's enough going on to keep it interesting.

It also amuses me that the game shares several mechanics with the drinking/card game A**hole. All those hours spent drinking and playing cards in dorm rooms finally pays off!

RATING: 7
Though I've only played this twice and only with 2 players, and I got beat down so bad by my lady while playing, I'm still really enjoying this game and can't wait to have my revenge, and to try it with a 3rd player.  It's funny because it plays a little like the card game "Asshole" or "President", but with much deeper strategy and a pile more sophistication.  I feel like anyone could learn to play this game, but learning to read just how strong/weak your hand actually is will be something that will take a lot of practice.
---
With a little practice, I think I'm getting a better feel for this game.  Timing is everything and bombs are essential tools for competing in this game.  Still haven't tried it with 3 though...

The more complex requirements for sets & bombs makes assessing your hand a bit trickier than Tichu. The key to the game is the three wild royals and their bombs, it makes playing even a string hand tricky to time properly. The bombed points going to the other player is a nice choice too, makes that decision even harder. This is our default travel game.

A fantastic game game that takes pretty much everything good from Tichu and gets rid of everything I didn't like. Amazingly good with two and almost as good with three. It has surprisingly few hands where you feel like you had no chance, although it can happen.

Haggis, a climbing/shedding/trick-taking game who owes a lot to its Tichu (amongst others) heritage, is rife with difficult decisions which make this game absolutely delectable. From the very moment in which you get your hand, your very first difficult decision is, for me, how do I even go about arranging my hand? As cards get laid, splayed, topped, and bombed, I find myself often breaking potentially strong arrangements: triples become pairs, runs get torn apart, and potential 3-5-7-9 bombs barely had a chance to be played out in the first place! Combinations of cards fluidly converge into one another that there is no choice but to break them, nor do you want to let your opponent run away with the game (the penalty for each and every card remaining before you is rather steep). With 3 wilds at your disposal every turn, there's also little reason why you can't go toe-to-toe with most things that aren't ridiculously strong (runs of 7?? OH MY!), but leaves you potentially vulnerable for each and every prince, queen, or king that leaves your side. Overall, an incredibly fresh and clever take on a genre that is incredibly old.

Forget about the Tichu comparisons. This is a two-player climbing game with bombs. There aren't many 2p card games that I like but I've played this quite a bit. It is nice that you scale the game somewhat (play for more or fewer points) depending on how much time you have.

You can play this with a normal deck of cards which makes it great for travelling.

Here are my thoughts on Haggis:  In the past two days I've played 4 games of Tichu and 3 games of Haggis (to 350 points).  So, I've got Tichu and Haggis on the brain right now.  Haggis is definitely not Tichu.  In my opinion, the only similarity between the two is the fact that they are both climbing games.  Tichu has a lot more of the fun factor than Haggis, but it is really not fair to compare them like that.  Haggis is a two or three player game and can never be Tichu, which is partnership based and can have some interesting specialty cards in the deck (Phoenix, Dog, Mah-Jong, and Dragon) due to the fact that there are four players and partnerships.  I think it is the partnership aspect and the specialty cards that make Tichu such a blast.  Haggis is for those times when you want a climbing game, but only have two or three players.  I think it does an excellent job in that role.  The game has surprising depth and complexity, which I like.  It is one agonizing decision after another.  Haggis uses three open wild cards (Jack, Queen, King), which can be played as wilds or bombs.  Very clever.  Haggis is a fun game in its own right, but is not Tichu for two.  Update - I've now played about 15 games and I must say this is a tricky and deep game.  It is very difficult to figure when to use the wild cards, since using them too quickly can put you at a serious disadvantage.  This is a surprising game.  Often, it is difficult to judge if you will be able to go out first.  My wife loves this game and requests it often.  I bumped the rating up to a "9" from an "8".  Haggis doesn't seem to get old.

This is a great little card game and it's a shame that it can be hard to get hold of, it deserves to be better known outside of gamer circles. It works best with 3 players, there's more uncertainty about the lie of the cards and a greater variety of combinations are lead. If you're restricted to 2 it's about the best job that can be made of a climbing game for that number, but doesn't overcome the general shortcomings of 2 player card games. The 2 player game is more luck dependent as the two hands are polar opposites in quality and given the small number of hands (~10 for a 250 point, 2 player  game) the player getting the slightly better deal is probably going to come out the winner. With 2 I prefer the designer's Auction Haggis variant where players bid for the lead while betting that their opponent will have a certain number of cards left at the end. Like Lost Cities, if you're happy to keep to 4 suits you can just play with a pack of standard cards. A lot better than Tichu with 3, but Tichu is still the king of climbing games.

Definitely more than just a Tichu clone for 2-3 players, I think the changes that Haggis brings to the table makes it a better game than Tichu (for me at least.  I don't have much experience with Tichu but have always found it a bit hard to wrap my head around).  What is lost in the partnership aspect is made up for with the addition of the wild cards, which adds a whole new level of strategy and head games.  The fact that everyone by default has the ability to bomb makes Haggis a bit of a cat-and-mouse game, with each person trying to draw the other player into making a disadvantageous bomb (or being forced to make one) in order to gain the upper hand.  It's just a really great system that plays fast and offers a lot of strategy in a short game.  Whereas Tichu reminds me quite a bit of spades (another game I'm not great at), Haggis reminds me more of double deck pinochle (a game I love) in the way you are trying to shape the way the hand is played in order to trap your opponent.  

Another plus: the 2-player version can be played with a regular deck of cards, while the 3-player version can be made with 2 decks of cards and a Sharpie.  Fun on a budget!

Jan10 Update:

Tried a couple new games since the following changes:

Cards left in hand a flat 5 points per card.
Only rainbow and flush bombs.

Both were a significant improvement.  My wife has also gotten much better so the battle was much more even.

Very nice game sean!

(Old Comment) May09: Got a few (10ish) hands in with the wife the other day. Thought I'd just splurt out some thoughts:

1. I went out first all but once. I also get to play a bit more tichu (say about 25 games to her 4 lifetime) so I've got a lot more practice. None-the-less, the luck quotient is not super high in this game. The wild cards add a heck of a lot of skill.

2. I liked the wild cards. At first they seemed a little odd, but pretty soon it was all about how to best use them. I very very rarely bombed with them since they were so much more useful in making combinations.

3. All straights being straight flushes was annoying, but it did cut down the big plays and make the wilds all the more important.

4. I actually liked the 2-5-7-9 bombs. Using them usually tore apart the rest of your hand, so it was actually an interesting decision on using them. That, and you gave away all the points.


I did have a couple reservations:

1. 360 points was just far too many. If we play again, I'll definitely suggest playing a "cribbage" game to 121, maybe best 2 out of 3 if I want the long feel. Just let who ever goes out first score each hand first so they can "peg" 121 first if possible. This is of course personal taste, but I'm just not an hour+ 2-player traditional card game player.

2. I dislike the full chart to calculate hand penalty points. I'd probably just play "5 points per card in hand" and call it good. In all our hands, we stuck someone with maybe 4-5 cards maximum. Having to refer to some chart to just figure out the score was too much. I know you guys did all that graphing and measuring, but I'm more of a usability man. I want to just pick up a deck of cards and play. If that chart was eliminated, then I wouldn't need a player aid at all. (Oh, why 5 instead of six? I can do multiples of 5 in my head and on a Cribbage board very quickly and I don't think the one point difference will actually change strategy that much.)


In the end, it does do a great job of bringing the climbing trick taking genre down to 2-players. I will definitely try it again.

Nice card game from 'beating games' family, similar to Tichu, but for 2-3 players (and obviously with no team play).
Some ideas are similar to Tichu and some are surprisingly fresh.
The whole design is really enjoyable.

  I strongly prefer 3-player mode - it's just more fun.  Though I know people who prefer 2-players games claiming they've got more control and there is no ganging up on a player who declared a bet.  BUT I haven't noticed such problems in 3-players games...

At the moment I slightly prefer Haggis to Tichu.  I've got more fun from it..
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Dang I need to play this soon, I've read the rules and it sounds very good and I know the designer really dedicated himself on this one.

[u]UPDATE[/u]:  Played it, yep its good, feels just like two player Tichu.  I'm wondering about a couple of the scoring choices, I'm thinking 10/20 for the bets would be plenty big enough and maybe 3 bonus for each card caught in hand instead of 5 each (plus the actual cards captured as in the rules). The reasoning is just to see a bigger percentage of the points being scored through actual trick play but I do need to play this some more before I decide.  

[u]UPDATE[/u]: 7.75 => 8.5 A new favourite and probably the best two player card game I have played, close if not (Netrunner is up there too). TONS of ways to play your hand, and these decisions are delicious and decide whether you win or lose much more so than any luck of the draw which has been minimized nicely by Sean.  

When I read the rules the bombs causing a trick loss seemed weird at first but it works perfectly in practice and makes for yet another tough decision as you give away points to get the lead. I also like that the loser always plays first, this is a built-in catch up mechanism that helps to keep games closer along with the bets (tourney play would be better with deal alternating). 

Great job Sean, looking forward to trying this 3 player, I think it should be quite good as well though a little less control as you have one other player who can take the lead away and bomb if neccessary. For now this is 2 player card heaven, short, tough decisions, lots of options and depth of play, wish you would have done this 10 years ago! 

[u]Tidbit[/u] - I like playing with the following small scoring tweaks (for 2 player games, have not played 3 yet) which has resulted in games being VERY close and coming down to the last hand: 

 - Player to left of dealer starts bidding and all players follow (actually almost the same as original rule, original might be better but someone could forget to bid)
 - Small bet is 12, Big bet is 20
 - Cards are captured as normal but with a bonus of 2 extra per card (not 5)
 - Game over at 150 or longer version 200.  

Reasoning is as I stated before, this way trick points are a bigger % of total points than original rules (especially with the big bets of 30 and 30-40 points coming from cards caught in hand). An average hand might look like: Small bet=12 or no bet=0, Haggis=4, Cards captured with bonus=12, Trick points=14 - 22(average). This mimics the last round I played actually and about average (14 trick points, small bet 12, Hagggis 4, 12 total points captured with bonus) and overall I liked the point distribution in the games I've played so far and they all come down to the wire.

I like climbing games, but I don't really have a partner for this so it doesn't get played much.

I was not impressed with my one attempt to play with three players. I think it would work well with three equally skilled opponents, but if one person is a little less skilled it's too easy to dump bomb points on them.

Since I don't have someone to play this with (my wife doesn't like trick taking or climbing style card games), I plan to give this one away to a friend I think will enjoy it.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (August 2011)

I love climbing games, so I like Haggis. I prefer to play this over Tichu, although Tichu has the potential to go up in my ratings.  I prefer to play it with 2 players but it is also great with 3 players (although it adds more luck, and possibly kingmaking situations). The cards are of good quality and, in general, Haggis is a solid game.
 
The rules are (relatively), simple but the gameplay has a lot of depth. I also like that you begin each hand with 3 jokers allowing for more strategic plays/bombs. 

The game can be a tad long if you play to 350 points, most of my games have been in the short format game (250 points).

If you like climbing games, I believe you will like Haggis, plus it is really cheap.

In conclusion, Haggis is a must have for me. I’m downgrading its rating so it matches my feelings for the with the BGG rating system. Haggis is a good game that I’m usually willing to play.

One of 2010´s favorites.

One play only

Definitely one for card game aficionados, after one play I got the rules but was only beginning to see what good play looks like. Identifying the good tricks in your hand after the deal and the weak cards counts, as does knowing when to play for the lead. If you get it right the benefits of beiong the first player out can far outweigh the points penalties of using a bomb to gain the lead.

Given it will take quite a few hands to find a winner, there's a metagame in there around baulking the leader and knowing when it's safe to fall back in points and when to press hard.

Intriguing and very well produced (thick, strong cards with a nice finish) in an almost old-fashioned way using an elegant but almost sombre graphic style

RATING: 8
Finely-tuned, connoisseur's climbing game created by a geek as an attempt to play 2p Tichu.Combinations and bombs are tailored for two players--the designer did a lot of work on that. Designer took Larry Levy's idea of giving each player wildcards to the max: three wildcards that can be used as wilds, as bombs, as cards.
You get points for cards left in hand (like Big 2 and Gang of Four) plus points for winning certain cards (like Zheng Fen and Tichu) plus betting you'll go out first (like Tichu and Landlord). Cards won by a bomb go to opponent's trick count (a bit like ""L'Excuse" card in french Tarot).  
Is Haggis more fun than 2p versions of other public domain climbing games? The graphic design and refinement add a sophisticated feel; but in the end, no. It's not necessarily Haggis's fault, for despite its refinement even the best 2p climbing game is inherently inferior to the 4p originals for a variety of reasons. 
I can't avoid the nagging feeling Haggis is trying "too much" to rise out of its genre. Climbing games are essentially simple gambling games, so Haggis is kind of like McDonalds trying to do espresso.

* Kickstarted! *

A trick-taking game with five suits, combinations that force the opponent to take the trick, and betting on whether or not you lose all your cards first. Not bad as a starter game, but not a game you'll play for an extended period of time. Still, lots of strategy as to how you get rid of the cards makes it more than simple.

PLUS: all ages, graspable rules
MINUS: handful of plays and you're done

The trick play is common climbing game stuff, however there a few clever ideas here to make this work with 2:

1) The face cards double as wild cards and in combination can be used as bombs. They are kept face up so that the options for each player are fairly transparent (there are a couple of other bombs you can play from your hand as well). 
2) You are punished severely for having cards left in your hand, which makes the bombs uber-important. Often you are giving up points in the form of bombs so that you can claim the lead and get more cards out of your hand.
3) A number of cards are left out of each deal, so that two-player hands are not calculable.

As with most climbing games, you have wide degree of options for what cards or combos to lay down, and your choices are often balanced against the number of cards your opponent has remaining. There's a lot going on in this relatively simple little game!

Had the honour of learning to play by the designer. Very interesting gameplay. I particularly like how the bombs work. 

I haven't played a climbing game before and the only trick taking game I've ever played was Hearts. Haggis tweaks the puzzle solver in me. I know a lot of care went into the scoring mechanism and it shows. I am certain, with repeated plays ,I will learn more and more of its secrets.

After 2 plays 2-player this is an 8 and likely heading up. I'd be hesitant to try teaching it to someone not already fully versed in Tichu or similar climbing games, but that's fine - its raison d'être is to fill in when you're short a player or two for Tichu.

The one doubt I have is that our games had only lopsided hands, there was never a tight score even on the few hands that had no bet. I suspect this is not a game flaw but rather a characteristic of inexperienced play.

Haggis is a good entry to the genre of climbing card games. I'm not a Tichu addict having played it only once but I see enough similarities to understand why Haggis is considered as the alternative to Tichu when only three players are available. If you like this type of game you'll like Haggis.

At the moment, this is my favorite game to play, hands down. It's only cards, so there's little setup, and once you have the rules down, it's easy to play.

However, "easy to play" doesn't mean it's not strategic...it is! This is one fun game that I will never turn down, but may well turn other games down in favor of this one.

Initial comments (6/10):
I really like the idea behind the game, it is an admirable feat, though my favorite thing about Tichu is the partnerships, so I still haven't taken to Haggis.

I like that the theme is not forced, but the artwork is still attractive, sort of like Keltis.  This seems to be a better choice, since no one really buys whatever theme that gets pasted on essentially mechanical games like these.

It will take more plays to see if this can become a favorite.  The biggest hurdle in my mind to overcome is how to play with the wilds.  Having potential bombs at all times changes how you play your cards quite a bit.

Update 12/10: Having played Tichu a bit more I really enjoy Haggis as a fun alternative that feels quite a bit different.  It is a much more difficult task to make the initial decisions about what to do with your hand.  Up to an 8.

A fabulous ladder climbing game. A distinctive feature of the game is how each player has three public cards: a jack, a queen, and a king. They can be used as normal cards (i.e., as better than a 10 or lower), as a wild card, or as a bomb. A bomb is like playing trump. It beats anything and you gain the lead. But using a bomb in Haggis means that's all you get: the cards and the points from them must go to another player. It's an ingenious idea, and it makes this game stand out. I love it.

Played once two-player and really enjoyed it.  Love climbing games like Tichu, Frank's Zoo, and Lexio.  I think it works very well and is much more interesting than the company's Triumvirate, which was okay. 

If you like trick taking games, esp climbing games, and if you like agonizing over decisions in a short game, you'll probably really enjoy this. I had a few hands where I just wasn't sure how to play the hand.  I forgot about the betting aspect, but I think this is a nice touch. (You bet 0, 15, 30 on whether you will be first out.  If you miss, your opponent gets those points. I plan to add 0,15,30 markers and reveal simultaneously, rather than how it's written in the rules.)

Interesting attempt to adapt Tichu to a 2-3 player game. I think some will love it, and others will find the differences ruin it for them.

I personally don't like the way everyone has at least one bomb at their disposal every hand, and the way that leads to a game of chicken every hand. I mean, if I wanted to play chicken, I'd play chicken, right?

Not bad, but I'm not entirely sold.

If you want to play a traditional card game, I guess this one is pretty good.  And, I suppose if you think about the fact that a new card game can stack up favorably against those that have been around for decades or even centuries, that's an accomplishment.  On the other hand, maybe those games have survived because you can play them with a simple deck of cards, and the bar isn't really that high.

If I'm in the mood for a more traditional card game, but one that works best with three players, then Haggis is the game I play. The ladder style play makes it much more tactical than your average card game, as you can lead a combination and then follow your opponents' play with a higher combo, thus getting rid of lots of cards. Bombs are great, but we've found that the 3-5-7-9 bombs are real game changers. Having an extra bomb in your hand often decides a round.

A climbing game very similar to Tichu but plays with three players.  Each player has 3 wild cards that can also be used as bombs.  The bomb tricks go to the other player.  You can place a "bet" before you first play a card to get more points.  If you fail to go out, other players get the points from you bet.  

It is not as good as Tichu, but more accessible.  It plays with two or three but I would only play with three.

An excellent 2 player climbing game. Cards in your hand can have quite a few different roles and the key is to realize when you'll have to use a card for a lesser purpose and break down stronger combos. I really love the joker cards (both players have 3) as they give you more options to play, but if you use them too quickly you are in trouble. You can also play the jokers and 2 different point card combinations as bombs to try to win the trick, but the other player will get the cards (and points as all the cards needed to make a bomb are point cards). You really have to calculate the need to use a bomb. If you have one bomb in your hand, it might be worth to make a Big Bet (30 points) in the beginning and use the bombs to secure your win for the round. Sure, you'll lose the points in those bombs to the other player, but the faster you empty your hand, the more cards you will get from your opponents hand and might even score some points from there.

Haven't played with 3 yet, but this my favourite 2 player game as it is. The only problem is that it can be a bit hard to realize all the possible combos in your hand at first, but after few plays it should start to be second nature. Skill >> luck in this game.

We've played this game about a dozen times and greatly enjoy it. My spouse said after the first play that it seemed rather random but after a couple of plays she said it's much better than she first thought. After she got acquainted with the various combinations, ladder-climbing and scoring system she asked to play several times. It has just enough difficulty to keep it interesting and overcome the luck factor. That said it doesn't have so much difficulty that you'd think twice about taking it out after a busy day at work. It's also nice that you can play it one hand at a time, number of hands or total points (150,250,350 or more) to vary length of play.

Very interesting card game. I was looking for a nice strategic climbing game and wasn't disappointed when I tried this game. Unfortunately my gf (main gaming partner) finds it boring... 

I like the fact that you have to plan the hand well by looking at what you can accomplish with your cards and doing your best to either win the round or minimize the damage when you know you're going to lose it.

Leading the round is very important and in the rounds we played those were the only times one of us managed to make a huge amount of points. But as the lead goes back and forth it doesn't matter, you try to take advantage of the lead when you have it and do your best when you don't.

Bombs are also crucial to recover the lead when you've lost it, and the whole mechanism is very well balanced.

Tichu for 2? Yup. Bomb timing, card play, betting, and sometimes a little bit of bluffing make up this small little game called Haggis.

Played once (2 player), this is akin to traditional card game, just a climbing one. It have Tichu flavor.

I would say it's quite good, in comparison to gin rummy for example. Some unpredictability introduced, but you should be OK with that in card game. Rating is more based on my play preferences, but without hesitation I would say "it can be hit with some people".

RATING: 8
Haggis is the deepest card game I own, and it has more rules and moving parts that most of them, too -- without being complicated or fiddly. It's meaty, satisfying, and brilliantly designed.

I love that everyone has known wilds available, the way bombs balance controlling the lead with giving up points, and especially the fact that you can formulate a strategy with some depth to it based on your initial draw. It also makes my brain hurt more than most card games, as there are so many options and levers to pull and decisions to make each turn.

Do you play big and hope no one bombs you? When do you bomb? Are you sure enough about your hand to risk a bet? Should you add a wild to make a hand harder to beat, but risk losing the points?

The iconography is fantastic, and the cards feel look and feel great; this is a nicely produced game.

* Haggis is the best way to get climbing game fix with two.

RATING: 6.5
I quite liked this game but my wife found the strategy to be far too complex (she said something to the effect that it would take her years to figure out how to play well).  So it's a good game but only a good "couples" game if both players really like deep strategy.  Which is surprising in a way because the rules are simple.  I bought this as a "bridge" to Tichu but now I'm not sure we will ever get there.

I have played hundreds of games of 13/Big 2 so was really interested in a 2/3 player climbing game. I do enjoy this game but for some reason it hasn't gotten played more. I think the reason 13/Big 2 get played so much more is that they work when you only have a deck of cards available whereas Haggis needs a specific deck of cards and hence, will tend to only be available to play when I also have many other games with me, leading to it often getting passed up for larger board/card games

Great card game for 2 or 3 players inspired in traditional trick taking games; for me this is reminiscent of Tute but way deeper. The rules are pretty simple but the amount of cards in hand, different icons and possible tricks make the game a bit hard to grasp, so it's common to lose so badly against more experienced players. We played the game wrong for the first time but even though it was fun. Haggis can go higher in my ratings, I want to play it more. 

Already played with 2 and 3 and I´ve enjoyed the game every time! Up to 8, Haggis is one of my favorite card games!

Not having played any climbing game before, we were a bit confused after the first couple of games. So these are regular face cards, also wild cards, and trump cards at the same time? So I've got this great combo, this bomb thing, but I have to give the cards to my opponent? What were those weird card combinations again? Fortunately we were highly motivated by the beautiful 2nd edition cards, played a round completely clueless, gave it another go, when magically everything fell into place. We finally got the point, and Haggis became a favorite since.
For some reason I always feel the urge for discarding two cards, or for drafting at the beginning of each hand, I don't know where does it come from.

Meg and I both enjoyed this one.  Haven't played it enough to fully grok the strategy, but it certainly is fun bombing your opponent.  We're not huge card gamers, and it only supports 3 players, so there's not many opportunities to play it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
~30 plays. First impression could hardly have been better, and the impression has held with experience. Playable with a standard deck of cards, which means Haggis has made standard decks the world over far more valuable. The commercial version has some nice added conveniences, however, so I play with that. I'll probably only ever play with two.

-Often compared to Tichu
-Simpler ruleset than Tichu
-No partner play
-Has a stronger "game of chicken" feel than Tichu. 

The even, open distribution of bombs is the defining element of the game. Hands are more even than in other climbing games, and there's a lot of open information. The game may be deep as a result. I can't emphasize enough how much this system for bombs improves play. Every climbing game with bombs should do them this way
  
I've seen it described in another comment as "Tichu: the brainburner", and I think that describes perfectly why I like it.

[update, after ~100 plays] - it has begun to feel repetitive and more opaque to me after many more plays. I still like it a lot (my average rating is about 5.5), but it's no longer to enter my pantheon of greats

Great 2-3 player trick taking game, though the publisher admitted to me that the designer really only intended it for 2 player.

There is a lot of depth if you want to play competitively.  The iOS version is quite good.

A climbing game that felt like Tichu: the Brain-Burner.  Everybody starts each hand with 4 open wild-cards which makes it much more difficult to determine if you can win a hand or not (since there's really no mechanism to force others to play their wild cards).  Some of the melds (especially the bombs) are difficult to see in your hand.  Felt like a puzzle at times.

Like Tichu, but for 2-3 players. Not quite as deep as Tichu, but an acceptable compromise when not enough players are around.

And, with the JQK cards, the fact that nobody ever has a "bad" hand means there's an interesting set of rock-paper-scissors dynamics which evolve amongst knowledgeable players in deciding how to play a hand. It's no longer a choice of what you can play, but rather which way you commit to playing it.

In this 2-3 player card game that is inspired by Tichu, players have the option of making small bets or large bets to go out first.  Having played Tichu, it does take some time to get used to the cards you can play. I think it only works for 2 players, as in a 3 player game, one player could sit back, forcing another player to do all the work to stop a bet. It's fun to play, and I haven't had a chance to try as a 2 player game.

The 'new Tichu' for three players.  While I love the aspirations of this game, as I love Tichu, the rules just leave way too much available to each player.  There are so many wilds it almost becomes a hassle to figure out the optimum way to play out your hand.  

Here is a hand of 7 wilds, have fun.  It just seemed so convoluted to me that analysis paralysis seems like a definite to me.  Too many options for the players.

A very intense trick taking/climbing game that has a lot of things going on at once, but it's simple enough for anyone who's played a card game to understand with a few plays. A great game to have a dedicated partner for; I prefer it with two.

The design of the components is both beautiful and functional. I played this game first with a standard deck of cards; the double sided no-suit face cards and the points on odds/face cards make the game much easier to play and score, and the Celtic knots, color choice, and ornate card backs are all appealing. My deck is pretty beat after lots of repeated play and rough shuffling, but it's still very playable. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2.5
I was really disappointed to find that the 2P version of this is playable in its entirety with a standard deck of cards, and it does reek of marketing cynicism. Am I the only one who finds the 'backstories' tacked onto this and Tichu to be incredibly patronising?

Even with three, the strategy is not all it's cut out to be, and the majority of a 14-card hand is just an exercise in whittling a hand down to a workable endgame. Like Tichu, a grave disappointment to those who take their card games seriously.

I'm bemused by a lot of comments lauding the production values. The cards look pretty plain and uninspiring to me, and the plastic box is a terrible storage medium.

[i][COLOR=#FF0000]Quick Update[/COLOR] - Haggis has since been replaced by Parade and Diamonds, which are 2 other card games my dad and son would rather play. I still like Haggis, but it has a steep learning curve when you are a new player and I haven't found anyone interested in learning.

[COLOR=#FF0000][i]My initial thoughts and rating ([b]8[/b]):[/i][/COLOR]

I have been playing Cribbage for over 25 years, mostly with my dad. We have played countless games of Cribbage, so when I found out about Haggis I was intrigued, but I knew my dad was my most likely opponent. The question was would my dad forgo a game of Cribbage to play Haggis? The short answer is yes. We are still in the early stages of unwrapping the layers of strategy found in this game, and we are really enjoying this game.[/i]

Really did not like this one at all, bought it to get the feeling of playing Tichu (great game!) with only 2 players. Falls horribly short of the mark, game is too fast & scoring is fiddly, also the aspect of both players having bombs in each game really did not work for me.

Haggis es un juego de cartas de escalada al estilo del Tichu o el poker chino. Este juego toma prestado varios elementos tradicionales, pero permitiendo más opciones al jugador. 
Fundamentalmente, mediante el uso de un quinto palo en la baraja, pero también mediante la combinación de juegos usualmente permitidos (escaleras y piernas de pares). Además, utiliza tres comodines de distinta jerarquía que están disponibles a cada jugador en todas las manos, y combinaciones especiales llamadas "bombas" que funcionan como un último recurso para ganar la mano.

En cada mano, el jugador bajará un juego utilizando las variadas secuencias y combinaciones permitidas. Los demás jugadores deberán superar el mismo juego utilizado por la mano. La ronda continúa hasta que nadie puede superar el último juego en la mesa, y quien lo haya bajado (salvo que se haya utilizado una "bomba2) podrá llevarse las cartas en la mesa a su pozo (que le otorgarán puntos) y será la mano de la ronda siguiente. El jugador que se descarte primero de toda su mano también recibirá los puntos de las apuestas que los jugadores hayan hecho antes de empezar la ronda.

Por su elegancia y sobriedad, Haggis es ideal como regalo empresarial o como atención a socios comerciales. El arte y los materiales utilizados en su producción son realmente sobresalientes para un juego de cartas tradicionales. A las personas que únicamente conocen los juegos de carta tradicionales, la dinámica de este juego les resultará al mismo tiempo sorprendentemente original y rápidamente asimilable. Por su fluidez, las decisiones críticas que presenta y la tensión adicional de las apuestas, este juego encantará a cualquiera que le guste jugar a las cartas, independientemente de su experiencia o su edad.

A coworker found this, and thought it had the potential to scratch the tichu itch when there were less than four players.  The game takes on a difficult challenge, balancing a tichu like game without using the whole deck, and allowing only two players.  My initial impression is that it is okay.  I may have too high of expectations because of tichu, and it also may be that I am not very good at this game.  The wilds face up in front of each player is an interesting attempt to offset the randomness of the draw, and I will give this many more plays to have a chance to up the rating.

RATING: 6
A decent Tichu type variant for 2 or 3 players. Like Tichu you play sets or sequences (no full house though) in order to go out first. But everyone starts with a J, Q, K which can be played like these when a single is led, or can be used as a wild otherwise. The scoring is different - 5 points per hand in your opponents' biggest hand, 30 points in wild cards and 1 point per 3, 5, 7, 9. With all the cards concentrated in just 2 or 3 hands, and with 3 wild cards each, there are some interesting questions to answer on how best to play out. It's also way easier to bomb, as combinations of the wild cards may be used, so nothing is safe. You live in dangerous territory if you use your wild cards too early rashly, leading to waiting to use them in your big go-out play. However the scoring encourages you to go hard early and get out while opponents have cards in hand, making for a less conservative affair than Tichu. Risk-taking abounds. I like how the bomb forces you to give the trick to another player, so there's a cost at least. Don't make the mistake we made in our first game that sequences can be any set of consecutive pairs (which made it too easy to go out quickly) - each set must contain the same colours as the other set(s). There's no card pass and no partner play, both of which still make Tichu the richer experience, but this seems pretty good if 2 or 3 are what you have and the Tichu nerve is tingling.

RATING: 7.5
A trick taking game for three players (or two) that is similar to Tichu. You play cards in sets or series, going around until no one can play. the last to play collects the hand. However, due to the sets and series allowed, there is a lot of hand management and deciding when to break a set or use a "bomb" can make a huge difference. Well worth a try is you like trick taking games.

RATING: 7
One of the better games that can be played with a standard deck of cards (if you are playing 2 player, that is).  It's ok as a 3 player game, but betting is much harder to pull off since the non betting players will collude to set the betting player.  I used to enjoy this game more than I do now.  But I have come to prefer other 2 player suits and numbers card games over Haggis, the best among those being Lost Cities, Battle Line, Hanamakoji, and Biblios.

Outstanding 2p card game (I've not tried it with 3).  There is a lot of depth here, as players gradually pick up more of the available tactics, and new concepts of how to strategize one's hand.  

After some dozen plays with my girlfriend we are still rarely confident enough to place bets – but the anticipation of such is one of the high points of the game. At first we were mainly playing with straight card play, but then we discovered how to use bombs effectively and that upped our game by a fat margin.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game is often described as "3-player Tichu", but I found it to be much less interesting.  The presence of more bombs made trying to put together card combinations less important.  My big knock against the game, though, is that it was really easy to pile on the leader during point distribution, making the game too yo-yo-ey.

(Played on iOS.)

Haggis felt similar to Tichu and Gang of Four, without partners and optimized for two or three people.  I liked how the game seemed to play faster than Tichu and had less cards to worry about vs Tichu.  I liked the wild cards opening the game up.  I enjoyed that it seemed to not be a quick shedding game in getting points as well.

With that said, it seemed similar to Tichu, enough, for me to really differentiate it too much.  I find that Tichu is often played more and I have more opportunities.

Very nice little "climbing" card game. You're trying to empty your hand of cards before your opponents by putting down higher ranked cards in sets, sequences and bombs (which give you the lead but your opponent the points.) Bets add to your points as well. The cards are really nicely done and the game play makes for a fun and competitive game. D also liked it... and as we generally like card games, I can see this getting a lot of play.

Do NOT riffle shuffle the cards (at least from the first edition.) The finish on the cards is too thin -- all of our cards have light lines running through the center. It's pretty much every card so we can't tell them from the back, but it's still annoying. Definitely needed thicker cards for a game with so much shuffling.

Played this on BGA 2p. This game has a lot in a small package! I dismissed it the first time around when I saw someone recommended it in the recommendation forum. About 2 months later it manages to get my interest again through various forum posts. I have looked at the video done by Tom Vasel again and this time it clicks. This is what I want in a card game. Difficult decisions, a bit of push your luck gambling, and lots of strategy! I was beaten pretty bad on BGA and I realized not knowing the full rule can get myself beat pretty bad!

---- Update ----
I just found out that my girlfriend doesn't like poker style card games so Haggis and Battle Line is kinda meh to her. Took this game off my wishlist.

---- Update ----
Got this in a MT as a sweetener. Will try to get to the table if my fiancee is up to it.

---- Update ----
Got one 2-player games played with fiancee and another 3-player game with fiancee and her friend. My fiancee said it's an okay game.

[floatleft][ImageID=1007051][/floatleft]Haggis is a two or three player climbing card game based on the beloved [thing=215][/thing] with similar elements such as betting, bombs, and benefits for being first to finish. I like the scoring mechanisms in this game and in particular I like how tricks won by bombs must go to an opponent. The design decisions in Haggis force players to make sound tactical play at the risk of giving opponents a significant amount points. The hand types differ significantly from other games that I am accustomed to but they become manageable after playing a couple hands and with the use of player aids. What this game has to do with actual haggis is beyond me but despite that fact Haggis is an excellent game.

A neat climbing card game. Nice card artwork, and some very interesting tactical plays. I really liker how the J/Q/K cards are available immediately, both as bombs and as wilds they allow all kinds of interesting card plays. It's still just a card game, and doesn't have the longevity of more complicated games, but it's very well done for what it is.

This ought to be a simple little game but I'm still wrapping my head around it. I chalk it up to my not having grown up playing card games with suits and such. So I'm a late comer.  It is deceptive in that there is a lot to think about insofar as timing goes. There is also quite a bit of deduction and manipulation. I'm not that good at the manipulation. Honestly, right now I bet 30 with every trick "in case" I win. Doesn't always work to my advantage. Still, fun game. I can see my mother-in-law digging this game. I actually play the iOS version most but I don't log iOS plays.

Although it sounds very similar to Tichu, it feels quite different to play. As I discovered, being a decent Tichu player didn’t make me a good Haggis player at all! I think the pre-set wild cards are a really clever idea. It’s tough to decide whether to use them to make sets or as a bomb. Would like to see how well this works with two players as it could be another one my wife would be keen on.

UPDATE Now bought and played with 2. I think it's better with 2 than 3, and my wife *does* like it :)

Terrific quality and card artwork.  Game play is a unique mix of familiar concepts.  The goal is to be the first one to empty your hand of cards.  Simple, but full of tough decisions.  Do I play a bomb and give my opponent points, so I can lead the next hand???  How should I play my hand- singles, doubles, triples, sequences???  Play multiple hands until an agreed upon score is reached.  Good solid fun.  The game packs light and is often with me during my travels.

A fun alternative to Tichu when there's only two of us.  I enjoy the game quite a bit, although it can sometimes be difficult to figure out the best way to play out your hand.  As a Tichu player, the fact that runs must be in the same suit can be very frustrating.

Like a lot of other climbing games, I can only compare it to the Vietnamese game '13' or 'bomb'. An interesting scoring concept that requires a pen and paper.

Played it with 2 and 3 players and haven't really gotten into the strategy of how best to win. Not a great player at climbing card games so that's to be expected I suppose.

Rated it a bit lower because I'm not sure how I feel about this compared to other games like Tichu or Tien Len.

I prefer this to Tichu. I think the "you may bomb out of turn" rule in Tichu is a love-it-or-hate-it thing, and I don't love it. Haggis also works better for me circumstantially, as I can easily find one other player for a traditional-feeling climbing game. Not so easily done in my life right now with a 4p partnership game. 

Haggis is hand management of the highest order, with constant decisions about breaking up seemingly strong runs and pairs. Betting creates these wonderful tradeoffs against bombing, and the presence of the haggis adds just enough uncertainty where you can hilariously wager a play on your opponent not having all three remaining 9s, only to have them lay down three 9s the next turn. Then you deal and play again. 

My neighbor and I play this over a glass of peaty scotch, and it's the perfect winter evening pastime for us. A game I hope to play for the rest of my life.

I am pretty sure everyone says that but this is essentially Tichu for 2-3 players. Why they did not make it 2-4 players is a mystery to me, but hey, so be it. An intelligent and intricate card game that is just complex enough to be challenging without being overwhelming. And it works as well with 2 as it does with more players. I know the 'theme' is pretty much plastered on but I still prefer it over Tichu's. The lovely Scottish celtic artwork on the back of the cards and the earthy colours, all good.

Finally got a chance to play this game yesterday. We played to about 250 and the final score was so close we called it a tie.

Really neat game, especially considering it requires nothing more than a standard 4 suit deck of cards (for 2 player). I enjoyed it much more than I thought I would and am now inspired to investigate other trick tacking games.

"Tichu" for 3 players.
I recommend to play with the following tournament rule:
"If the trick was won by a bomb, the cards played to the trick are captured by the player that would have won the trick in case the bomb had not been played."
This replaces the rule:
"If the trick was won by a bomb, the cards played to the trick are captured by one of the winner's opponents (the winner of the trick chooses which)."

A terrific climbing game from Sean Ross for 2-3 players.  I am a big fan of Tichu but the need to have 4 players (all of whom are familiar with the game's concept) means that I would never get it to table.

Need to get a bit more of a hold on betting strategy but, at present, very much enjoying this.  Nothing beats the pleasure of looking in your hand and finding a rainbow bomb, ripe and ready to ruin the other player's evening.

(+) Smart trick-taking mechanisms here that allow a clever player to maximize the use of their hand.  
(+) The nature of formation of tricks makes each round rather exciting.  
(+) Bombs give some very interesting, balanced comeback mechanisms.  

(-) Tricks unique to Haggis are somewhat unintutive to begin with. Ruleset sometimes reads ambiguously.  
(-) Limited to 2-3p and does not really play well with three.  
(-) Very... brown. Honestly, it's tough to fault Haggis. It's just that trick-taking games are, quite commonly, an acquired taste.

I didn't think I liked laddering games, having played Tichu and Clubs and a few others.  But I like Haggis.

The luck is greatly mitigated, the score betting is much less swingy, the bombs are actually interesting instead of wild luck, and the fixed royalty in every hand is very clever.  The game is full of tough choices and maneuvering.

29-05-2014. Rated after 1 play. I finally got to play this game after spending about a year to try to hunt a copy down in Europe. Now I have it, I am not sure why I wanted it so badly :). The same game (for 2 players) could be played with a regular deck of cards. Luckily, I like Haggis quite a bit. It's a nice trick-taking, ladder-climbing game with a nice twist with all the bombs. It plays 2-3 as well, and it plays quickly.

All-in-all, my bruised and battered copy will remain in my collection, mainly because I picked it up from the Compleat Strategist in NYC, while I was there on job/vacation purposes but also because I like the game enough to want to keep it around. I expect that given time the cards will look about as shoddy as the box does (crushed on the plane back).

----------

Pretty standard climbing game, similar to Lexio or Tichu but playable as 2p game.  These types of games never excite me, but may be a good time killer if you only have a few minutes.  

I actually prefer the gameplay of Lexio to that of Haggis because you can play a Full House (a pair + a triplet) in Lexio.  But I do like that Haggis mitigates the luck of the draw by giving each player an equal number of wild cards, whereas in Lexio a player that happens to get all the 2s will more than likely win the round.

Overall, not a bad game.  It's a very casual affair, and something that would play well on travel.  Probably better with 3.  If I'm going to choose a quick-playing card game for 2, I'd easily choose Battle Line over Haggis.

Tichu for 2 or 3 players.  I prefer Tichu, but it's some fun to play when you have just three.  I don't like it with just two.

RATING: 9
If your group only has 2 or 3 players this is a great substitute for Tichu (minus the teamplay dynamic.) Reading the rules the game appears to have much in common with Tichu; however, after the first hand it becomes clear that the strategy in each games differs quite markedly. In Haggis bombs are much easier to obtain (everyone starts with at least one in every hand!) but they can be a double-edged sword since the lead is gained at the cost of points. Going out first is still important but becomes less so as the size of your opponents hands are reduced.

Love Tichu but don't have enough players? No problem! Get yourself Haggis, and you'll be all set. Tichu is the best card game ever, so Haggis has a hard act to follow. It's totally up to the challenge, however. There's some really chewy tactics here, covered in a game that is still straightforward and intuitive. If you have less than four people, there's no need to play three-handed Tichu anymore.

Visual Appeal: (5)
The game looks great with each suit on the cards having a distinguishable and unique color. The Celtic feel overall is well achieved. The game looks just familiar to be comfortable like a bicycle deck, but just fresh enough to pique one's interest.

Components: (5) 
Cards are linen finish with rounded corners. Not many other components, just 3 thick cardboard betting chits. No noticeable wear after a few dozen plays, and should hold up for the long haul. 

Theme: (0)
This is a non-thematic game.

Learning: (5)
Rules are easy and assisted by player aid cards that display the trick types, and bomb types in the game. This makes rules referencing a non-issue. For anyone who's played a trick taking game before, the only things to learn are how betting and bombs work.

Gameplay: (4)
The game plays very smoothly and rounds end quickly. There is not much room for error, and one bad play can easily lose you the round. If Peppy taught me anything, it is to use bombs wisely. The idea of giving away points to lead the next trick is the core difficulty of the game. You are always thinking of what your opponent will do next.
 
Overall Fun: (3)
I can find almost nothing wrong with the game except that it wears thin after too short of a time. I used it as a filler until the game became so automatic that we realized we enjoyed the conversation we were having over the game more than the game itself. Now it is relegated to a nice compact travel game until it has a chance to cool off a bit.

Currently the hot card game at home, taking the place of Cribbage and Mhing. It does make me feel a bit guilty about not spending more time and effort getting to learn traditional card games, rather than just trying what's 'hot' on the geek. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Guaranteed wild cards are a nice idea, and they can really open up opportunities - perhaps a bit too open. Definitely a nice idea with the temptation to bomb too early, but the cards going to an opponent.

Scoring is a positive here. Players are encouraged to get rid of cards to minimise your opponent's scoring. So, even if you've got an average hand you might be tempted to push ahead and leave yourself floundering a bit, knowing that at least the opposition won't score much off your risk.

All a bit wild and wooly. It's okay and I'm happy to explore further. Nice graphics and box size.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
As far as climbing games go, if there are 4 players I'll play Tichu, if there are 2 or 3 I'll play Haggis (which is much better than Gang of Four in my opinion).

Often, a couple of cards will be part of different possible combinations, so chosing the right way to play cards is even more difficult than in Tichu, for example.

In addition to that, the three wild cards mechanism is a brilliant idea. It is so hard to decide whether to play them as a high card, as a wild card, or as a bomb.

The cherry on the cake is the scoring system: just as in Tichu, securing the point-worthy cards often goes in the way of finishing first... especially as tricks won with bombs must be given to an opponent.

Played three hands to try out the game. It has been referred to as "Tichu-like" or "Tichu for 2 or 3". Having never played Tichu I can't confirm that. What I can confirm is that it was an interesting climbing/trick-taking game. 

Easy to learn the basics but there are many, many different strategies whether which card(s) to lead with or using your wild cards.  Rating may move up once I have tried it a few more times.

RATING: 8.5
two games, 2 player. 

I like it: simple, yet not elegant.
[-]It certainly shows that it has its roots in traditional card games as the way the rules come together is not as elegant and simple as in most designer card games of similar ilk (must try Battle Line). [/-]. [i]Actually according to designer's notes  the organic quality of the game was created by statistical simulation created to keep various ways of scoring balanced. [/i]As I'm fond of some traditional cards games, this is the quality I admire. It takes some time and searching the forums to get all the rules straight though as it's not that intuitive to learn and too easy to miss a line in the rules. 

On the gameplay, it gives you a lot to do for such a simple 2 player game: deciding on combinations and how to take over and be able to lead with a new trick. It's also not quite obvious which hand is better and how to use it, which is a plus. With repeated play the whole tug of war and outwitting each other aspects shine through and create one of the best 2 player experiences I've tried. 

On the graphic design: my guess is that a lot of traditional card games woiuld be simpler to pick up, if they'd be given custom decks. It's a little short of being perfect: the back side illustration style does not fit front (art noeveau with heavy lines); the face cards have colors with low contrast, hiding the illustrations;  font for the numbers is not the best fit for overall design. 

edit: liking it more with each play. Just my cuppa, it seems.

I love card games and this is no disappointment.
Having a good knowledge of trick taking games(like 500)helps in Haggis as it is a lot about when to win the trick and when it is more advantageous to duck the lead.
Having the lead here is not such a good thing at times and knowing how to form a better reactive hand to win the Haggis is one of the joys of the game!

This is one of the funnest games I own!

We have played it with both two and three players, and enjoyed it quite a bit at both player counts. The wagering mechanic is interesting, though we aren’t comfortable enough with the gameplay yet for either of us to feel super confident about when to bet. The climbing aspect of the trick taking is interesting, and different enough from The Fox in the Forest that there is definitely room in our collection for both games.

I played a lot of "Rich man, poor man" (basically, a Japanese ladder game) as a kid, so I was initially really excited about this. However, Michelle never played that game (how she managed that, I have no idea, because it really is a pretty popular game in Hawaii). Anyway, she doesn't like it, even though she beat me very badly the first 5 or so times we played. It wasn't until I started using bombs more often that I started winning. She still doesn't like it very much--even though she wins most of the time--so I'm not sure how much more we'll play it.

A very nice take on Tichu, with more than enough changes to justify itself.  Great for when you want Tichu, but there are only two or three of you. That said, it's a much more calculating game.  I feel that the decisions are harder, especially as bombs only get you the lead rather than points and how you play out your wild cards can get a little brain burny.

I dig this. It is pretty clever. I've never played Tichu or any trick-taking games aside from Euchre at all, really, so I have limited experience there. But, you can tell a lot of time went into designing and testing this. And I love games with tricky strategy that is difficult to wrap your head around. I do find the big 14 card hands to be a bit unwieldy, and find that too much of playing well involves sorting and staring at your gigantic hand, though.

Haggis is Tichu for two or three players. It bests Cribbage as my favourite 2p traditional card game. 

As in Tichu, some hands are better than others, but there are always several ways to play whatever you're dealt. Gutsy play allows for improbable comebacks and wild swings, but it can as easily create large deficits. Haggis is full of calculated risks. Betting against all odds, ignoring the weakness of your hand, is the quickest way to lose. Play the long game, stay in it, and hit hard when you have the chance.

The game is playable with a standard deck of cards, but the deck makes scorekeeping quicker and easier. Besides, the designer, Sean Ross, deserves to be rewarded for his efforts. I've purchased more than one copy after wearing through the cards. I can't imagine a game in this niche better suited to my preferences.

PnP version: An interesting take on a Tichu-like game (although the public bomb cards, which both players have, make it feel significantly different), but it's just not as much fun with just 2 players. Plus, the scoring isn't nearly as quick and easy as I'd prefer.

Published version: now supports 3 players (an extra suit of cards), and the scoring is MUCH simplified (which is a very good thing!). Need to try it with 3.

The genius of this game relies on the management of wild cards and bombs.  There is a real tension in deciding what to do with them every turn.  Since every player has the same initial bomb/wild setup, there is a bit of dare/chicken metagame going on too.

Still what I enjoy of climbing card game is counting cards and knowing what has passed and remained to be played and forcing my opponent into move they don't want to do.  That's simply impossible in 2 players game with 8 cards in the Haggis.

[Indie Boards 2nd edition, #223] {Card; shedding, betting; optimal 2-3p}  Haggis is not a trick-taking game in my definition, but it's good to support an original game; esp. when this game can be played with 2p.

Haggis is a fun and interactive game.  It would be more fun with aggressive players who would keep on betting.  Players have to guess and count cards in his opponents’ hands, so to plan a good move.  The bomb is tactical in order to get a lead at critical moment.  The design of bomb is trivially balanced - you have to sacrifice points to opponents.

This little game is a surprise.  It’s more difficult than I expected.

The rulebook of my edition needs polishing.  Some rules are ambiguous.  I need to refer to BGG forums to clarify certain rules, especially about the wild cards and bomb.

The card quality is very good but the illustration is dumb.

There's absolutely nothing wrong with the game. In fact I'd say it's the best example of genre that I've played and has an especially excellent wild card/bomb structure. If you want a 2P/3P climbing game then look no further.

Unfortunately I've found I hate them and hated the time I spent playing this one. The complete lack of information available from your opponent, the time spent calculating the various combinations in your hand instead of playing, the tension that is painful rather than exciting, the lackluster bidding system, etc.

Her words and I agree : "An old fashioned type game for sitting around drinking, smoking (we don't!) and passing time"

I'm always surprised at how long this game can take to play.

Sometimes you get an awesome hand and can just bid like a mofo but sometimes your bad timing can just destroy you.

update:  What an awesome card game.  I think it is a perfect pass the time game with excitement, reading the other player and comebacks.  We like it but only every now and then.

At times, the tension in the game is quite high -- especially in the last few plays before someone goes out. Great two-player card game.

RATING: 8
I'm enjoying this in the early going, which is probably not surprising given that I'm a big Tichu fan. Haggis is clearly not as involved as Tichu, and while there's plenty of room for being creative with your hand, it doesn't nearly equal the options presented by Tichu, where you are constantly rearranging your hand and your intended plays based on how the trick is developing. So, Haggis isn't as deep at Tichu, but since it plays well with two or three, it does occupy a slightly different niche. I guess my main concern about Haggis is with three players, where everyone is bombing points and feeding them to the last-place player. I guess it's an OK catch-up mechanism, but I've never been overly fond of games that feature bash-the-leader or boost-the-last-player mechanics heavily. Still deciding if that aspect of Haggis is a flaw or feature ... But that's more of a quibble than anything else, and I'm sure there are still some depths to Haggis that I need to explore.

RATING: 8
Similar to Tichu, but for two players. More tactical than Tichu; we have a lot of experience with that game and can plan most of what we will do with during a hand just by looking at the cards. Haggis calls for more adaptability during play. More strategic than Tichu; only two players, so play is more predictable, and both players have three powerful wild cards available, but their existence and usage is open information, resulting in a chess-like feel.

After learning Tichu, I now appreciate this game a lot more. It really is like a two-player version of Tichu thanks to a few adjustments.
You each have three wildcards, so you almost always have the ability to follow your opponent's lead. The decisions lie in determining whether or not it's worth it to use those valuable wildcards at any given time. The wildcards are also a key way to make bombs, so losing one of them really limits your options.
Bombs also work differently from Tichu, in a way that seems more balanced for two players: you still get the lead after you bomb, but you have to give that trick to your opponent, meaning you give them at least four points (bombs are always made up of at least four points).
There is even one aspect that I consider an improvement over Tichu: the way losing a bet works. In Tichu, if you don't meet your bet, you lost those points. Meaning you can get zero or negative points for the entire hand, putting you further from the 1,000 point goal. In Haggis if you don't meet your bet, your opponent gets those points. This means that you're both always moving closer to the goal so games never drag on due to bad bets.

This is a great option for when I want to play Tichu but I don't have four players. Now I can play something similar whether I'm with two or three players. I'll always have a copy of this in my collection. If you like traditional trick-taking and/or running games, you should look into this and Tichu. Great little game.

[thing=37628][/thing] is an escalation game, much like [thing=215][/thing], but especially made to be a 2 or 3 player game. Every round, the first player opens the hand with a set of cards, which can be only one card, a pair, two pairs, a sequence, and so on. The next players must either pass, or play a set of the same amount of cards, but with higher number(s), this, except if a bomb is used - the bomb is a given set of cards (like: 3-5-7-9 of different suits, J-Q, Q-K, 3-5-7-9 of the same suit) that can win any hand, losing only to another bomb of higher level. The winner of the hand is the owner of the set with the higher number/level after the other players have passed. If the trick was won by a normal set of cards, the players takes it for himself; if it was a bomb that won the trick, the player that used the winning bomb, must choose another player to give all the cards of the trick.

The goal of the game is to get the cards that are worth points, win our initial bet (or get to points of the bets of the others) and, if possible, be the first to empty the hand of cards. After the distribution of the cards, the players may bet on themselves to be first player to play all the cards. The bets can be made in the following amounts: 0 (no bets), 15 (small bet), 30 (big bet). If the player is right in his bet, he get the amount as points. If the player didn't bet, he will get the points of all the bets that didn't came through. The first player to empty his hands, gets 5 points per card in the hand of the player with most cards at the moment the last card of that player was played. Also, the first player that empty his hand gets the points of the wrong bets. Finally, all the player get points for the cards (that are worth points, not all are) of the tricks they have won. Usually a game goes to 250 or 350 points.

I really enjoyed my first play of [thing=37628][/thing], and so everyone else at the table. It is an easy game to understand, the only hurdle is the scoring system, but after a couple of hands, we were fine with it. Since in the game, players always win points, the game also always go towards the end, unlike [thing=215][/thing], where the players can get negative points and the game can dragg.

[thing=37628][/thing] is cheap (is only a deck of cards, after all), but the art in the back is neat, and so as the symbols for the suits. The box is large enough to hold the game with sleeves, if the insert is thrown away. A fine addition to the trick-taking hall of games (though some might argue that an escalation game isn't a trick-taking game, but is potatos, potatos), one that plays remarkably well with 3 players.

*** Update: I played [thing=37628][/thing] more times and it is indeed a great game. I liked more than [thing=215][/thing], not only because you only have to consider your own hand, but also because the wilds dynamic: having them makes all the difference, since you basically always have four possibilities of bombs from the get go. I have a friend that loves [thing=215][/thing], so I warned him: "Don't play this as [thing=215][/thing]", because, in [thing=215][/thing], it makes a lot of sense to hold cards, in order for, later on, start to dish them out and no one can stop you. Not in [thing=37628][/thing] - you will start this, then take a bomb in the head, and end up with a lot of cards in your hand, and this giving lots of points to someone else. He played like [thing=215][/thing] and was really behind, only after "re-thinking" his gameplay, he started doing well.

The simplicity of rules was appreciated, compared to Tichu: no mahjongg and wishing, no phoenix and dragon being sort of similar but not really, and which is which. It felt much cleaner. I also liked the fact that all players have access to bombs. The lack of partnership, of course, was a detriment, but all in all it's enjoyable.

A masterpiece. Perfects the ladder genre. Stands with those cardgames that have been played & perfected for centuries. The quality of the game play is matched by the art design & component quality.

By far, best 2-player. Which is great, because there are so many wonderful trick takers for more.

I will forever value the pre-order printing over the final version with it's bridge sized cards & top-left-only card ID's rather than the pokersized l/r printing on the final.

So I am sold on Haggis. Especially for someone who is not a fan of the trick-taking genre, Haggis is great! First of all, I have played Tichu and other trick-taking card games. They can be intimidating and often times, one inexperienced player can mess up the whole cooperative relationship. Since I am terrible at trick-taking games, Haggis allows me an outlet to improve  my play in a two player setup. 

I didn't quite expect to like Haggis as much but the variety and the endless possibilities for winning a hand is really quite impressive. The 3 wild cards absolutely shake the whole game up as nothing is really safe, not even when you lead a trick with an unassailable combination as bombs can be played from the wild cards. That being said, bombs also afford a lot of points for your opponents and sometimes, winning a hand while dropping bombs will narrow the margin of victory (or even lose out in points).  Haggis, like Red7, Schotten-Totten and a few Asmadi card games are great for two players and is one of the VERY few card games with immense replayability.

I now look forward to Tichu (shudder).

I need to play this with people who are interested in climbing games. Every single play I've had so far ended with people intrigued, but not eager to try it again. I think there's some good stuff going on here, but I need to find some folk to play it with.

Update 1: Could not for the life of me find anyone to play this with. Makes me sad, I loved the Scottish aesthetic and I think I would have really liked it. Traded away.

Update 2: Couldn't stay away and re-bought, and finally sat down with someone who knew what they were doing for a (more-or-less) full game. FINALLY getting my brain wrapped around this one has really helped, and I even managed to pull ahead in the game. It feels like there's a bit too much extra involved, rules-wise, in order to balance it out for 2p, but I remain fascinated by the game as always. Upped rating.

RATING: 6
I like the basic idea (I like Tichu a lot). However, with Haggis, getting an overall picture of your hand is quite difficult. Figuring out all options and combos (especially some of the bombs) seems very difficult and slow. The other thing I really didn't like too much of the way the scoring worked the scoring. It felt a bit overly complicated for such a fast game.

Very clever trick-taking game, which works especially well with two players. Often in trick taking games the hands will play themselves out after a certain point; in Haggis, the fact that a certain number of cards will be left out of each deal lends a welcome hint of uncertainty to proceedings.

A fairly basic trick taking game, sort of like Spades with the addition of "bombs" to take tricks at a loss to re-secure first place, and thankfully rid of the team aspect that always added a bit of additional anxiety.  Not as deep as Tichu but that's both good and bad.

Bombing a trick means that you win the trick, but you choose who (other than yourself) gets the points.  This usually means that it's very hard to stay in last place for long.

This is really my biggest gripe with the game.  You play a number of rounds that don't matter, because of the equalizing factor of that rule.  Often, only the last 2-3 rounds that you play really make a difference.

Great card game.  I've seen it referred to as "Tichu for three players" and it is based on the climbing family as is Tichu, but with just one play it sure feels like a different but no less satisfying game.  The major shake up here is three face up cards that can be used as wild cards and for bombs.  Figuring out how and when to play them really makes for some great choices in the game.  I am very anxious to get to try it again!

A 2-player trick taking game that delivers the full tension, bluffing and betting of 4 player trick taking games.

As a huge fan of Hearts, Rook and other trick taking games, Haggis is the only game that has delivered the same feel in a 2 player experience. (Triumvirate does a good job of making a 2-player trick taking game work, but it is a unique twist on the genre).

Haggis, is a climbing game in the same family as Zheng Fen and Big Two.

A nice trick-taking game that plays equally well with 2 and 3 I think. The rules are a bit head-scratchy and we always need to freshen up on them.

Haggis is for 2 what Tichu is for 4: the best trick-taking game out there. I don't know any other climbing-game for 2 that even works well - let alone as well as Haggis.
It might be a little bit swingy sometimes, but most often the better player will win anyway (at least concerning long games of 350 points).
If you're not convinced go take a standard deck of cards (or Sticheln) and try for yourself. If you like it buy a copy. 4 heavily distinct suites really do help seeing your options.

I was hoping Haggis would scratch Gwen's Pinochle itch and be more interesting for me than our two player Pinochle variant.  I was right on the first count as I found trying to make the sets of cards that would empty your hand most quickly while also retaining control of the extremely important lead fascinating.  The second count didn't go as well as Gwen admitted much of her love of Pinochle is nostalgic and that it does play on autopilot... meaning Haggis is not really relaxing as you are so deep in thought balancing the possibilities of each hand.  So... if you are looking for a two player trick taking/climbing game you can really sink your teeth into you can't do better than Haggis.  If you are looking for something light and breezy as a relaxing couple's game you might want to look elsewhere.

[-]2011-03-28 [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b] Tentative rating, after a super-short 2p game.[/-]

2011-04-15: [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] This is a nice climbing game, with simpler rules than most, but more satisfying gameplay than most (perhaps as a result).  Suits have no ranking against one another, so nothing to memorize there.  There are no really crazy cards.  There are no cards whose ranks differ from their face value.  All cards that are worth points have the points prominently displayed on them.  Valid plays are sets ([i]n-[/i]-of-a-kind, where [i]n[/i] can be as low as 1), sequences/runs of sets (in which each step of the ladder must have the same suite of suits as all the others), and bombs (which are neatly documented combinations of the cards worth points).
Yet the challenge is kept high by the usual tough climbing game choices, and the fact that sequences must match suit the whole way (and a sequence of singles must be at least 3 steps, while other sequences may be as few as 2).  The betting in the game provides another nice element of suspense.  My favorite thing, however, is that all the scoring is positive:  Anything that would lose you points in most games, in Haggis simply gains your opponents points, instead.  This is functionally identical, except for the enormous fact that you are always moving toward the target score.  The game [b]will[/b] end.

Well done, Sean!

Thematic, light and silly tile-layer/racing game.

The game is divided into two parts: 1) a setup phase, where people are added to the city of Pompeii through card placement, and 2) the lava tile-laying and people movement (out of the city) phase.

In the first phase, the goal is to add as many of your people as possible to the city of Pompeii, using cards.  There is some minimal strategy in that some locations are better than others, when you add to a building with other people already there you get people growth (neighbors), and you can plan to group up with certain people.  However, there are the Omen cards, which come out randomly and these allow a player to choose any other player and dump them in the volcano (this happens ALOT in this game).  Eventually this phase ends with a particular card that comes at a semi-deterministic interval.

The second phase is where the real game starts.  Each turn, you draw a lava tile and place it adjacent to existing lava tiles of the same type (and if you happen to kill some other people, oh well!!), and then you move (race) your people towards the exits and out of the city hopefully.  Hopefully.  The game ends when all of the lava tiles have been played.  The winner is the player with the most people out of the city.

This is really a quite simple game, but it's fun, thematic, and has great components, and seems to play well from 2-4 players.  Probably a good gateway game or light filler (despite some opportunity for planning, the game can't be taken too seriously).

Played this with Chris and Sue and Kara at the beach, and had a blast.  The theme is great and plays out well with the mechanics, and the game makes a perfect light-medium Euro.  I'm not sure if anything changed since I played the original version last summer, but hopefully not--throwing other peoples' meeples into the volcano is extremely satisfying!  [update] I love the theme in this game, but I wish it played more than 4.

A clever game by the creator of Carcassonne. First of two acts - You populate Pompeii vying for positions related to town gates preparing for an eruption. In act two, townsfolk run for their lives trying and players try to get their family members out of town. Every survivor is a point in your favor. Ties are broken by the least amount of victims in the castillo .... erm... volcano!

I liked my one play of this, but have no great desire to play it again. I appreciate the mechanics of the deck and the double game feel - the first being one system, the latter being another. Clearly well tuned as a game, but feels out of date in style and substance. It was also a tiny over complicated, but all in all, not too bad.

Chaos here, chaos there, chaos everywhere. But hey, fleeeing from lava streams while heavens are pouring hot ash and rock down on you, must be a mayhem.

In boardgame terms the above means that there is luck involved with the card draw, there is luck involved with the lava tile draw, the placement of citizens and relatives is chaotic since you have no control over other players, the placement of lava tiles is chaotic, since you have no control over other players.

So the whole game is very chaotic and luck driven, but knowing this there is still some room for cunning. Good for occasional casual fun but nothing to get excited about.

RATING: 9
Smashing!  An almost perfect light-medium game that would also be good with growing families.  The theme is fantastic.  I defy anyone who isn't oversensitive (being thrown into a volcano might not be your Aunt Maud's idea of fun) not to enjoy the idea of this - a gold star to the designer for the volcano-tossing idea alone.  Having one of your pieces, in a good position, thrown in can be excrutiating, though.  Still, you can get the rotter back and feel the exquisite pleasure of seeing his piece fry.

Play does not lack for choices and hard decisions have to be made.  Those who say the first half is without decent decisions have not grasped this one at all! (shakes head).  I've played it many times and how you place and spread your pieces, which cards in your hand you play, what order you play cards in, how you utilise neutral areas and how you move your pieces are all crucial to how you're going to do. You cannot win by not thinking.  Sometimes you have to more or less kill off some of your own pieces to get a win.  

Hey, if you've not played this, if anyone suggests it, you should jump at the chance.  You'll probably want to play it again very quickly!

Fun!  Fun!  Fun!

This game is what people say it is - a very good family game.  It's quite light, easily understood.  My 7 and 9 year old girls really enjoy it.  It's easy to play up the tension of the volcano and omen cards.  Even my wife, a reluctant gamer, enjoyed her first game. 

The components are high quality.  The board is bright and quite large.  The cards are very well done.  Nice art work.  The wooden people are nice to handle.

+ Pretty good connection between gameplay and theme; Very easy to teach to all ages.
- There's way too much luck with the Omen cards and with getting relative bonuses in the first phase of the game.


Why it's previously-owned:
We out-grew this game.  It started off being fun and pretty engaging, but it eventually just became a bore. We were just walking through the motions after the first couple plays.
I traded this away for Caylus: Magna Carta.  It's hard to say what game took this one's place because it didn't really have any memorable mechanic other than the volcano.  And we did not find another game with a volcano.

I don't know why I love this game so much, but I've been attached to it since I first played it (though have yet to add it to my collection). I think I mainly like throwing meeples in the volcano, but in general it has some unique mechanisms and is good fun. I definitely would recommend it as good light strategy, and a family game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Pretty random, but a good bit of fun.  And I lost, which means it isn't totally luck, probably.

I like it more than the rating suggests (it's not such a great "game" but is quite fun).  Also, I knock off a bit for Mayfair being so cheap they didn't include components to let anyone play blue or yellow in 2p games.  COME ON, PEOPLE.

The real problem is that Pompeii is two games:  a thoroughly tedious and over complex "setup" of placing people and then a rip-snortin' good time of running from the lava.  The first part takes half an hour and is irritating, the last part takes 15 minutes and is great.  Sigh.

I suppose this might be a decent family game, but in general, I think one could do MUCH better for a family game than moving lava around to swallow up other players.  This game is thus very overrated on BGG.  Mercifully, the game is short and random (its not your fault you won or lost), but then again, rolling a dice to see who gets the highest number is also short and random, though yes, not as thematically devious.

The Downfall of Gaming.

An easy "1" for me. Does it work mechanically? Barely. Is it fun or humorous? Slightly (and here's where I start to have a problem with it). Should it be considered a game? No. The theme alone is distasteful and unsuitable to the notions of what a family game, a "light" game, or maybe any game should be. 

Rather than trying to help everyone escape, or fight against some sort of existential threat together, players jockey to help their own clans escape. Everyone is fundamentally a victim, and players can use the volcanic debris to kill or impede their neighbors and fellow citizens. The lowest point was throwing human sacrifices into the volcano, which bizarrely (and quite morbidly) also serves as a tie-breaker mechanic.

"Let's use the volcano to kill each other while I self-servingly help my family members to escape (and no one else). The player with the least victims wins!" All of this amounts to shameful display of human behavior that the players are asked to recreate to be successful. "Screw everyone else--run for your lives!"

The fact that the mechanics are light is also a problem, in that its lightness runs totally contrary to the immense awfulness of its theme. This would be fun and funny if it were all played for over-the-top satire, but sadly, it's not. It unknowingly satirizes itself, and perhaps many other games that abstractly depict human suffering.

Maybe the game is ahead of its time, and my standards are outdated. Maybe 2000 years from now future humans will find it fun trying to escape real disasters (natural or otherwise) from our own time, such as a tsunami, a hurricane, the Wilhelm Gustloff, a mass shooting, the Twin Towers on 9/11, or a concentration camp. Light mechanics could be applied to any human tragedy in the way this game does to produce dog-eat-dog fun for the whole family.

To me, the game represents a despicable low point in the hobby, probably more for the fact that its tastelessness was apparently unrecognized not only by its creators, but also by we board gamers. I'm not sure if it's better or worse that adults enjoy it, or that they let their children play it as well. What lessons does it teach us, exactly? 

Ultimately, we've reached a point, and this game is perhaps the epitome of that, when it's become OK to make a game for a game's sake. It shows no sensitivity to the suffering of the historical people represented, nor toward the awful decisions that it's asking its own participants to make in the name of "winning" and "fun."

My wife said it best : The Carcassonne of Death! LOL.
But this is a seriously good game. In the first half you are placing members of your patrician family into locations through out the city. Every now and then this delightful card called an "omen" gets drawn that allows you to throw an opponent's family member into the volcano. Yes, there is a plastic piece that gets inserted into the board to represent Vesuvius. At a certain point in the game an "AD 79" card will be drawn that halts the first half of the game. From this point on your are attempting to get your people out of the city while drawing lava tiles to place throughout the city (a bit incorrect in the theme since Pompeii was buried in ash by pyroclastic flows but lava tile sounds better than pyroclastic flow tile I suppose) to possibly block exits from the city or to just kill other opponents' family members. A very morbid and macabre theme if you think about it too much but the game abstracts it nicely. The person who has the most family member saved when the lava tiles run out wins the game. 
For some extra added fun look up the "Doctor Who" variant on BGG. If you are a fan of the show you will love this fan-inspired variant.

This is a favorite light, gateway game with a great theme.  There's some luck involved, but just the right amount for the time involved.  

It's fun trying to get your people in the houses nearest the exit, but spread out.  And when the volcano erupts the decisions on who you can save and who you can't and who you must move now and who can afford to wait are interesting but not too much of a brain-burner.  And, of course, getting the right lava tile to destroy a crowd of your opponent's people is great.

Placement rules seem overdone for the amount of randomness involved.  Love the look of the board, great volcano bits.  Despite assurances that such a blowout hadn't been seen, one player had 20+ people on board after the first phase while the other three had around 10 (despite all being experienced gamers with obvious intentions of maximizing).  Perhaps it's not usually that bad, but it does seem that random.  Anyway, I did enjoy the latter half but it just made me want to play Through the Desert or even Fjords instead.  I might have said Survive there, if I had actually played it.

There's a lot of randomness that you can't necessarily control.  But then, that's perfectly thematic.  On the other hand, the theme makes no sense as you are deliberately trying to kill your opponents by magically redirecting the lava.  But it's a ton of fun to throw them into the volcano.  This is a dumb game, but it's one you can have a blast with.

There can be a lot of kingmaking in this one, you have to be careful of that.  To me it's a tactical rather than strategic game.

Game play takes place over two distinct halves of the game.
First is getting people into the city of Pompeii, hopefully making use of the "Relative" rule to add even more than just one per turn.
Second is doing your best to get all your people out through the gates of the city and putting lava tiles on top of the other players pieces.
Fairly simple gameplay although possibly not the best for introducing people new to the hobby.

Best fun with sound effects (no offence to anyone with relatives lost to lava flows).  Somewhat heavy on the luck factor.

Ok, so maybe I'm rushing my opinion of this one, with only 1 game played. But man, it was fun. Much more fun than Wrede's most famous effort (Carcassonne). I don't know why... the mechanics are really simple, and there is much more luck of the draw here than in Carcassone... but there's an undeniable charm to trying to get the most relatives possible, and an even more fun time trying to get all of your people out in time.

Plus, it's a game where, on my very first time playing it, I knew what I was doing. Very intuitive!

All that said, I wouldn't be able to play it with my wife, who hates aggressive games. It won't get much more aggressive than this... at least not for an Euro.

For now, it stands a solid 8, which might vary in the future depending on it's replayability.

UPDATE: Still a good game, but I'm burning out a little bit on it. Down to a 7.

It is absolutely a fantastic game and I will definitely consider putting it in my travel kit.  I wish it came with a quadfold board and a slightly smaller box to make it more portable, though.

Kifejezetten tetszett! Könnyed kategória, fél óra kb., a szabály is max 10 perc. A több teljesen eltérő játékszakasz nagyon érdekessé teszi. Ritka az ennyire tematikus játék, néha tényleg izgultam a láva miatt, elég sok emberem a hegy gyomrában végezte (volt műanyag póthegy, sokkal jobb mint az igazi, és nem lehetett belelesni).
Könnyelműen azt lehetne mondani, hogy nagy a szerencsefaktor, de mivel legtöbbször mi döntünk egymás kárára, mégis elég jól kiegyenlített a játék: az első partiban egyikünk zsinórban 5(!) Ómen kártyát húzott (senki más nem húzott Óment, nem kevertem túl jól:)), kidobálta az összes emberünket, mégsem nyert. Ebben a játékban elég jól lehet bosszulni:)
A játék képét alapvetően befolyásolja, hogy mikor jön fel másodszor a kitörést jelző kártya: akár dupla annyi ember is felkerülhet két különböző játékban a táblára.
Összességében nagyon megérte kipróbálni, már a szabály alapján is jónak tűnt, nem csalódtam benne.
Konfliktuskerülő ill. sértődős embereknek TILOS a játék:) Szemétkedésre hajlamos embereknek viszont kötelező:)

Pompeii is a lighter but very mean euro, with the awesome mechanic of putting other players' citizens inside the volcano.

There are two distinct phases: first everybody fills the city with people, then the lava starts to erupt and expand and players must move their citizens out of the gates.

I liked Pompeii more than I expected. It's light and there's not much control on what happens, but it is definitely enjoyable and fun.

Initial Impression: There's just something fun about throwing your opponents people into the volcano to appease the gods. This game is light on rules but there's a fair bit of tactics involved. Although there are temporary alliances that form, the metagame doesn't seem too important in the game. Initial placement of your people is important but quantity even more so. This game does not outstay it's welcome.

This is rapidly becoming one of our favorites! It's a fairly light game, but is lots of fun and has enough strategy to keep you interested. You have to pay attention to what's going on, especially in the last phase. You must maximize your movement points if you want to avoid leaving pieces in the city when the game ends. 

Highly recommended!

This game is an absolute blast. Thanks for introducing it to us David. I don't feel that it is a race game, like some do. It seems really to be area majority. I enjoy the Phase 1 of the game, setting up the board, which most people have voiced as tedious. I think it makes or breaks who wins the game and is where the main strategy lies.

I like the idea of the game better than the actual gameplay. In the end, it was fairly random. Not to say there isn't some strategy, but it wasn't very fulfilling. It needed more than placing and moving the people and then drawing lava tiles. Not enough to hold my interest.

RATING: 4
A shallow game where the mechanic seems to steer moves more than any applied skill. Luck is a huge factor and success and failure fall absolutely on the card draw. After that best moves are very much obvious.

Perhaps a gateway game to draw people into gaming generally, but hopefully they'd appreciate more skilful games.

Scored a 4 rather than any thing lower as the banter across the table could be a laugh with the right people. On line play is as dull and cold as you can get.

A pleasant enough filler in two distinctive parts, one card-driven one in which players seed the board, and one tile-draw phase, in which players add to the lava flowing into the city, trying to encircle and trap other people's citizens whilst securing he safe exit of your own lot. You also get to throw citizens into the volcano, for reasons that shouldn't be scrutinized too closely through a historical lens.

Having missed out on the original edition, I'm glad to have got a copy of the reprint.

I love the theme and the mechanics of this game. It's easy to teach and easy to learn. First the placement of your people and then trying to get them out of Pompeii while avoiding the lava flow. ....and what's more fun than tossing a few of your opponents villagers in the volcano?

As a bonus it plays great with 2, 3, or 4 players.

The Downfall of Pompeii is a light and relatively short game that provides unexpected delight in tossing your rival players' pieces into an erupting volcano.  Gameplay simulates the population and evacuation of the Roman city Pompeii in the years up until the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in A.D. 79.  Even after the signs of the volcano's impending eruption begin to show, players can continue to further populate the city and move relatives of current residents into different buildings.  There will be obvious competition for locations closest to the various gates that provide the only way to escape a gloomy volcanic fate.  Once the volcano begins erupting, players will take turns deciding where lava will flow throughout Pompeii and which two of their residents they want to move closer to / out of the city gates.  Residents sharing a location with other residents will have greater speed in moving throughout the city, while residents stuck by themselves are slower in making their way towards the gates.  Each player will relish the opportunity to send lava flowing over their opponents' resident pieces, or even using the lava to block all means of escape from the city, dooming all unlucky souls to the volcano.  Victory is determined by the number of residents each player is successfully able to escape from the city, with ties favoring the player who had the fewest number of residents tossed into the volcano.

The game has a little bit of everything. It is strategical, tactical, there is a fair bit of luck involved and also has a strong push your luck element. Besides that the two distinct phases in the game give it a very unique feel. The clever card play to obtain the best positions in the first part feels very different from the 'race or die' feel of the second part. All in all this makes it a worthy addition to most gaming collections. Despite the dark theme I also feel this is a nice family game.

RATING: 8
What a great gateway style game.  The way that you can teach this game in stages makes it very accessible to all players.  I can see that there's a lot of strategy to a more experienced player, but it's lots of fun for your first time as well.  There's almost a balancing mechanism because if one player is extremely successful at getting people on the board, others will rush to kill that player's people.

The setup of the deck is a bit time-consuming.  Also you have to be comfortable with a game where you openly attack the other players.  Still there's so much nastiness going around that it's hard to get too upset.  I've had a ton of fun with this game and expect it will become one of our favorites for years to come.

Three plays, but first two were with an incorrect setup, so let's call it one play with four players.

I'll come back to this when I've got some more plays under the belt.

----

Played a "real" game with 3 other "real" gamers - we were in a nice mood originally, so things felt a little flat, but as we started nearing the finish, things finally got nasty and the fun started. Still, there really doesn't seem to be a lot to do in this one. More of a family game - which is perfectly fine by me.

----
Have played about 7 more times...I'm liking it more. Also found out I was playing incorrectly - once the family's come in, they can go on the same colored buildings (or non-numbered ones)...I was playing they have to come in on the same *numbered* buildings. Quite a big difference.

Strangely enough, it's taken us a few plays to get the rules right.  Preparing the card deck is a bit too fiddly, but the game is fun.

This game is really a pleasant way to spend 30-45 mins. Have only played it 2 player so far, but I am really enjoying it. It is not what I would like to spend a whole evening playing, but for this short playing time it is really quite a lot of game.

Update 080308: Raised the rating to 8. I just like this game. Plays great with 3 and 4 players as well, and is a lot of fun without requiring too much hard thought.

Fantastic, feels like a euro, plays like a light filler. Quick and deadly. One moment you are battling to fill Pompeii with your settlers and relatives, the next you are tipping your opponents pieces into boiling lava and trying to work out which pieces you will have to sacrifice to allow others to escape. Play time is more like 45 minutes and there are tactics there but no requirement for brain-burning strategy or long term planning. And there is a volcano!

I had better expectations on this one. I don't know what is the problem but I don't enjoy too much playing it. The only thing I like is that the game combines two types of games in one: 

1. Pawns placement (cards combined with some strategy) 
2. The escape (abstract strategy).

Light family game.

An okay filler game.  Good for mixed crowds of kids and adults.  This game is light and should be played fast.  There is some strategy (mostly in card plays and when meeples run for their lives), but the strategy is pretty linear (get as many of your guys on the board as possible and position them to get out fast).  I see myself playing this game from time to time, but I don't need to own a copy.

Others say:  luck of draw, turn order imbalance, take-that-ish.

This is a tough one to rate. It's fun to play, and easy to learn. However, after a while you will learn that the first part of the game, when placing, ain't that important and that the second part, moving out, consists with lots of luck with the tile drawing. 

I have only played this with 2 players, but I guess that it's better with 3 or 4. It will definitly be different when you can't be sure of avoiding lava anywhere until your next turn.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A very light filler game, that has a strong theme. The game is divided in two distinct phases. The rise and fall of Pompeii. In the first phase you try to get as many meeples on the board, and close to the city's exits. Incidently someone gets hit by a flying boulder from the volcano that's about to erupt. The second phase is about getting as many meeples outside the city borders when the magma starts to flow through the premises. All meeples who suffer a burning death get thrown into the volcano. Winner is the player who got the most people out. Ties are won by the player who has the least amount of meeples in the volcano.

Not much strategy in this one. Getting many meeples on the board can be a boon or a bane. Instinct would say that more meeples in the city means a higher chance more could escape the wrath of the volcano. However, more meeples also means more can die, and you don't get more turns to let them flee than your opponent. With more meeples dead, you lose the tie, which is important because scores often are pretty close.

I like it enough to play it once in a while. It's so simple anyone can join in, and although the meeples look abstract, you're constantly busy tring to save them. It's lively enough to be fun.

While not a game I'm always dying to play, it's fun with the right people and the full player count. Who doesn't love sacrificing their opponents to the volcano?

And a flickering LED candle for the volcano is absolutely a requirement.

RATING: 6
Pure fun, but only the second half of the game.  The initial two rounds are just so-so, but it adds to the build-up before the third round.  Running from the lava is just great entertainment.  Hurling a block of lava on your friend's relatives: priceless.  And to top it off, you then get to toss them in a volcano!

Problem is there are way too many times that the game ends in a tie and the volcano has to be used to find the winner.

I think this is a great "gateway" game that introduces card mechanics, tile-laying mechanics, and move mechanics to non-gamers.  There is some randomness with card and tile draws balanced with some strategic people placement and movement.  Lots of games comes down to a few "survivors" and beginners have a relatively good shot at winning (or at least doing well).

Light, short, silly (in a good way) eurogame. There are two phases: first, players place their pawns via cards, then the volcano erupts and players move their pawns to flee the city while drawing and placing lava tiles with which they can kill others' pawns or block city exits. Gameplay is far from deep (in fact, the Omen cards can be annoyingly random), but the whole experience is a lot of fun, no matter who wins. Throwing dead pawns into the volcano is a guilty pleasure. Truly enjoyable.

RATING: 7
What's not to like about throwing your opponents into a volcano?

The first half of the game with meeple placement is a tad mechanical. But when the lava starts flowing, the fun begins.

Quite thematic for a euro.

Not the deepest game, but quite high on the fun category.  I am sorry to read that it was reviewed poorly coming out of Essen because four of us had 45 good minutes playing this recently.  I would play again, and would even consider buying it as a light to medium game.

I've played this quite a few times now... and I'm still enjoying it. A friend recently brought it over and we played twice. Good stuff. It's fun to scream as your meeple is plummeting to its death in the volcano. Great theme, and good game play. I  think there are a few different strategies to be thinking about as you load up your people, and as you escape. Good stuff.

BUUUURN! My fiancee and I had a tremendous amount of fun playing this. This is much better if you play "panic mode" (i.e., no analysis!) during the volcano phase. Seriously, the lava is coming!

UPDATE: Tried it 3 player. Any game that makes you jump up, scream, and curse the draw bag (while your opponents mock you mercilessly) is a winner in my book!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Not unpleasant but more than a tad random and not much in the way of decision making - features which would grate if it went on longer but it plays quickly, even with four, and produces tight finishes.  The main fun comes from hitting your opponents with lava then chucking them in the volcano and, actually, that is surprisingly fun.

Very light but fun!  It's great trying to chase your opponents down with lava while trying to escape with your own guys. The first part of the game (placing people in Pompeii) is pretty boring, but once the volcano erupts things pick up a bit.

This game is a blast to play with the family.  One of the few games in which you actually enjoy being killed because you get to scream as someone throws you into the fiery pit of a volcano.  I like the fact that it has two distinct phases; it never gets old or boring, even for my 7-year-old, because the mechanics of the game shift completely half-way through.  My son creamed the rest of us in the first game.  The adults were all trying to slowly move people out from the interior of the city, and he moved out the ones closest to the exits.  We also managed to play this in less than an hour the first time, even with someone who has analysis paralysis.  Perfect family game.  If your family has Ticket to Ride, Settlers, and Blokus, get this next.

I really like "Survive! Escape from Atlantis", so I hoped that I would like this too. I sort of did, but I feel something was missing. After a couple of more playthroughs I like the game more and it's a great little game of screwing each other. 

I think that it's funny to place the lava tiles and throw your opponents people into the volcano, and I think that the first part of the game where you place your people tokens is quite interesting too because you need to think about where to position your people, and I also like how you move your people X number of spaces according to which space they start on with X number of people. So

My personal recommended number of players: 2, 3, 4

When playing a more competitive game of Pompeii The random acts of luck with the omen cards have started to bother me. Now that I've played the game more I play more aggressively to win and can get frustrated with some of the luck. The game is still fun to play, don't get me wrong, but with gamers it might get a little frustrating with the draw. The strategy is rather simple and the game is fun and engaging. I do like throwing people in the volcano.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A very fun game.  I like the light-heartedness behind the concept (invite your friends to the city, knowing that flowing lava will ultimately lead to their deaths), but the strategy behind the placement and movement of the people in the city is the crux of this game.  Some in-depth strategy necessary to play, and the games can be tight as the final stages of the game approach.

Scales well for 2 players, but plays best with 4.

This is fast and quick with just enough skill to keep you coming back. In the first of two phases players are heavily dependent upon the cards they are dealt.

This game consists of 4 distinct phases (2 major phases, each of which is broken up into 2 more).  The game is interesting, and the playing time feels faster than it really is.  There's some maintainance on the draw deck as you go along, but this really doesn't bog the game down.  We play 2-player, and the gameplay seems pretty balanced.  Even if one of us has alot fewer people going into the second major phase, he still has a chance.  Although you can afford to lose more, having more people makes it more difficult to get them all out in time.  We take this game lightly, so that tossing people in the volcano is fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I was disappointed with this one. I was really looking forward to throwing meeples into the volcano, and that certainly didn't disappoint. What did was the gameplay. The first phase seemed rather pointless. The relatives phase slightly less so, but with the pointlessly confrontational omen cards thrown in. It is not that I'm against confrontation. Many of my favorite games feature it. Just this variety seemed very arbitrary. And the final phase just felt a bit min-maxy without a lot of real decisionmaking.

I love to see folks complain about the "luck element" in a game about throwing people into a volcano.  This is a fairly fun game somewhat similar to Survive (although not as good) that plays in two distinct phases- a setup/placement phase that is somewhat boring, and then a more exciting, nasty, run-for-your-life phase.  It's one of the better Euros I've played in a while because it's A) actually fun B) has actual competition in it and C) there's plenty of death and destruction to mete out to the other players.  It's also a pretty short game, in the 45-60 minute range.  I don't know if it's something I'd play a lot (or more than twice), but every now and then this would be pretty entertaining as long as no one brought a copy of Survive.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A classic! It's such an unusual game, in that it consists of several parts, all of which have different gameplay and tactics. 
There is a LOT of luck, but it's just so much fun.
And this completely disproves the old 'euro-games have no theme' argument: this is dripping with theme! This game tells the story of Pompeii from arriving in the city, omens of disaster, inviting relatives to join you, making sacrifices to the gods, and finally fleeing the city as the volcano erupts. 
And you get to throw your opponents in a volcano!!!

The 2nd Euro game I played and the first with my friends. I wanted to buy another gateway game, after buying Ticket to Ride and playing with family, but this time I wanted a game to play with my friends, which I think would like confrontational games, so I wanted a game with a better theme. I played it with 3 people and they loved it. I think the paper model volcano and Pompeii theme makes it really easy to get into the spirit of the game and I was amazed by the "clean" feel of the gameplay. Hardly any fiddly bits (as compared to Last Night on Earth) and really fast game play. This is the game that made me want to buy more Euro games, as I found Ticket To Ride too light, although my cousins loved it. I was surprised that we could sort of roleplay the game a bit which added to the fun.

I love the switch from a card-playing game to a tile-laying game.  And how can you not enjoy pleading for your people's lives as they are sacrificed into the volcano?  Tortured screams and final words ("I regret that I have but one live to live.... Aaaaagh!") definitely help to bump up the fun factor.

Have played a lot on Yucata.de, mostly 2p which gives you a little more control but it's still a bit chaotic. I like the ebb and flow of the game where you pile as many pieces in only to try and get them out again. Always fun to dump your opponents' bits in the fiery volcano.

Tried this one based on recommendations read here on bgg when I was a newbie and its been a hit with the family!  Who doesn't love throwing people into a volcano?  Excellent gateway game that really grabs the attention of new gamers with 2 phases of gameplay comprised of an amalgam of mechanics (hand management,worker placement,area control and then tile-laying with a race component) that work so well together as a surprisingly simple introduction to eurogames.  The only downside I see on this one is the fiddly deck set up - not a big deal once you get used to it, but I think might turn off new gamers unless they have someone to lead them through it the first time (one of the only reasons I hesitate to give this as a gift unless I'm pretty sure I can be there to teach the first game).  Also has a significant "take that!" component which some kids (or adults) may not like.  Overall, a great family game!

There's stuff to like in here to be sure. Running away from the hot lava death is fun, of course. My bar for owning a game is pretty high these days, though, and this one didn't meet the bar due to two things, both related to the Omen cards: 1) There's no downside to getting omen cards--it's pure goodness, and yet it's completely random when and how many each player get. And 2) The Omen cards have the "pick on another player at random" mechanism, which is among my current top least enjoyable mechanisms.
I bought it when I thought that would be the only way to play it, but when I played someone else's before opening mine, I sold it.

Why this game was never picked up by any major Dutch label will be forever beyond me: it has delightful mechanics, a rock-solid subject, plenty of good-natured take-that gameplay which turns the most peace-loving person into a rabid sadist once the lava, erm, 'gets' another victim, and is easy to learn as a final bonus. It reminds me of Emerald in many ways, but the subject is better tied to the mechanisms, although I'm still not sure why people get to have more movement points as meeples are clustered together. It's also somewhat odd that you can get to safety near a city gate on the foot of the volcano... But other than that, good, clean fun in a simple package. Go get it while it's 'hot'!

[b]Update[/b] I still think this is a charming game, but with more emphasis on 'charming' than on 'game'. Game-wise it is actually rather weak, because there isn't much you can do to change your fate, and people generally have a good idea how to make moves which cause maximum damage. There's also a nagging suspicion that the game is self-balancing in that the more people you get into Pompeji, the harder it becomes to get them out because you need to make more moves. Game-technically the game lost two points because of this, but I'm giving it back one point because of the 'whole package' so to speak, a rare occasion.

RATING: 7
The subject matter may be a little dark, but this game is lighthearted.  It's a good mix of strategy and fun.  The two phases of the game could be disjointed, but the designer cleverly set up the mechanics such that you need to think about the second phase as you place markers in the first phase.  Very enjoyable with 2, but I found it to be a bit too random with 4 players.

My main complaint with this game is that the ending/winner can become a foregone conclusion before you're truly finished - it's akin to throwing in your hand before playing the last trick in Euchre.  It's not a huge deal, but I just don't enjoy that aspect.

It's got typical mayfair components, ok but kinda eh.  The placement of people is kinda weird.  I get to add more people (relatives) ok.  Cause I put a guy in a spot with other guys, ah ok.  It works as a game which is most important but as a theme its dumb.  the fun half of the game is trying to trap your friends in the lava flow.  And for the little kid in me, dumping your guys in the plastic volcano is fun.

Pretty fun. I see the comparison to Survive! but it's a tad more dry and therefore a little less fun, IMHO. LOL, I was tempted to  write scoring numbers on the bottom of the people.  Still a very fun game that I will definitely not turn down a game of. 

Update: After a few more plays, I have upped my Rating.  It has more strategy than Survive! with more rewards for better play.  I'm definitely not going to ever get rid of this one.

Components: Beautiful board, with lots of ambient details that add to the theme without detracting from the functionality. The cards are simple, but easy on the eyes. The tiles are up to Amigo standards, though there could perhaps have been a more gushing-lava design to them, rather than the veins of lava they now sport.

Experience: Very interesting two-phase game. Both phases feature limited numbers of attractive moves, yet there are engaging decisions to be made. The first phase is very different from the second; in the first, players budget their cards to cleverly get as many followers on the board as possible, and nearest the exits; in the second phase, it is a puzzle, a la Chinese Checkers, to efficiently transport followers toward the exits. There is a lot of chaos in the final attack of the lava, but the game moves quickly enough that the final phase seems exciting rather than anti-strategic.

I enjoyed this game. It's fun to tactically try and off your competitors with hopes to throw their citizen into the volcano. Light strategy makes it easy for almost anyone to pick up. Con of the game though is set up. You have to build the deck, which isn't horrible, but prevents you from just pulling out of the box and exterminating citizens. Also poor quality of cards.

Non-gamers really enjoy this game.  It must have something to do with throwing other people's cubes into the volcano.  

The most difficult thing to explain is that there are two separate phases--moving people in, and then having them run away from the lava.  Once this is understood, the game flows (har har) well.

This is definitely one of those games that is best taught by actually playing the game and explaining what to do as you do it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
After a couple of plays this game is everything I wanted it to be.  The division of the game into two phases allows for some strategy in placing of your townsfolk and there's plenty of opportunities for screwing over your opponents.

What the game does extremely well is give the feeling of people moving into a city and then fleeing for the gates as lava starts pouring into town.

It may not be the most deep game around but there are enough decisions to make to keep it interesting and the game is just fun.  Tossing opponents into the volcano is oh so satisfying!

The game falls into two halves: before and after the eruption of Vesuvius. Before the eruption, players play cards to place their pieces in buildings. After the first eruption, they can also place as many relatives as the number of pieces already in the building they placed their piece in. When Omen cards are drawn, the player can take any opponent's piece and throw it into the erupting volcano. In this manner, players try to get as many pieces onto the board as close to the exits from the city as possible.

RATING: 9
Quick and works for both gamer and non-gamer alike (more as a filler for gamers, though). Has a way of making interactive cutthroat play both acceptable and fun. Plays okay with two, but more is better.

No reason this game should be out of print, yet it is. Get a copy if you can find it.

RATING: 5
I will probably have to play this again, but IMO is one of the few games that is *obviously* overrated here on BGG.

Rating after 1 play, will play it again before trading it anyway ^_^

I mean, come on, the first phase is borderline random and, probably, really much more complicated/long than it should. If Klaus had streamlined the game to create a more linear and quicker first phase, this would've probably been a nice family game, since the second phase, although very obvious, decisions wise, is at least fun. As it stands, the decision you have to make in the first half really don't matter that much.  Maybe there should be some variant added to lessen the luck of the draw in the first phase (e.g. You can play 2 cards as a single wild card, but from that point on, your hand is reduced to only 3 cards and so on)

Very fun little game, and the theme almost works perfectly... except that when the volcano starts to rumble, you decide to invite your friends and relatives to come to the city. (Whaaaat?)

Apart from that, this is a very clever game. It has an abstract element of build up and then escape, but it also has a tile-laying element of placing the lava tiles as they overrun the city.

Oh, and yes it's fun to throw your opponent's people into the volcano. Gotta role-play that.

So this was a game that we first played at a con a number of years ago.  While the cards take a bit to set up, the gameplay is pretty awesome.  The idea is that you get to populate the island of Pompeii and then the volcano erupts and meeples are devoured by the lava and cut-off from the city exits.  It is a lot of fun to toss meeples into the included volcano.

Fun, light game that is enjoyed even by younger kids, who seem to delight in throwing their parents' (or uncle's) pieces into the volcano. The meeple-placing phase is fairly hum-drum, but the ensuing tile laying is a hoot. The game can be played with as much screwage as in Escape from Atlantis (a lesser game, in my view) or in a more friendly way, particularly with only two players.

The Downfall of Pompeii is very rich in its theme and I find it to be very fun. However, where strategy is concerned, most often it is clear which decision is the most obvious or most advantageous. I still love the game and enjoy playing, but if it weren't for its short game length, I would find game play too simple for repeated plays.

Game of two halves: The first half is boring, the second half is shallow and obvious with decisions a three year old kid could easily make.  Yes, but it's fun, I hear you say, since you get to drop small wooden pawns into a rounded cardboard hole.  Gosh!  My sides are splitting with laughter as we speak.

Pompeii is a light and fun game.  There is a lot of opportunity for diplomacy/kingmaking, which always makes for a close game.  Who doesn't like throwing someone else's pieces into the volcano?!!

Even so, there are some fiddly rules that I take issue with which make the game much more difficult to explain than it should be.  I might come up with a variation which I can teach to people like my parents.

A little light for me to rate any higher.  But it has good theming for such a simple game.  Put your guys on the board (using cards) in the first phase.  Once the 2nd phase starts, you draw magma tiles and run for your lives!  I like how the movement off the board is conducted.  Your people have to be organized in their evacuation in order to get out alive.  That's where the real meat of the game is.  High luck factor no matter how you slice it.

An interesting game.  I was expecting the 2 player game to be a bit dull as multi-player games sometimes don't scale well down to 2 players, but this one worked well. Both phases of the game involved very interesting decision making, and it had a nice balance of skill and luck. The rules were fairly easy to explain so I'm planning to introduce this to my casual gaming groups. Looking forward to seeing how it plays with more people.

An interesting topic for a game sees you trying to escape certain death at the hands of Mount Vesuvius.

Fun game. You place as many people in the city as you can before the Volcano blows; when that happens you then get the heck out of dodge. The person who has the most out wins. 

Rules for the "relatives" can be a little tricky at first but flows pretty good. Quick game (even teaching 3 new players it took about a half hour)

If that doesn't sell you on it, throwing people's meeples into the volcano when they are eliminated from the game is satisfying.

I had been searching for the Pompeii game for ever. I finally picked up an expensive copy from Germany, only to find that it was to be reprinted a few weeks later. Oh well, I certainly do not regret the purchase. This is a terrific family game. There is more than enough strategy to satisfy an adult but my kids love throwing each other in the volcano, and then when the lava starts to expand all over the board the tension is wonderful and palpable. Even the rather dull people-placement first third of the game is excusable with such a climax to greet you when the volcano erupts. Superb fun.

The Downfall of Pompeii plays rather fast and there isn't a lot of rules. Very simple, chaotic, some randomness. Theme is interesting. Questionable re-play value.

Don't take the game very seriously. If not, it can kill the mood of playing this game again. Some spots on the board are better than others. You first put people on the board, once that's done, the volcano erupts and you try to save the most people as possible for the win.

Initially had rated this higher, but after several plays, concluded this was not for me.  I like the components, map, even the macabre theme, but the deck set-up could be slow, the card play not overly interesting and post-eruption, came down to a lot of luck or very obvious moves.  Not sure I am onboard that movement equates to the number of people in the sqaure.  Definitely more of a family game, always fun to throw mom's pieces into the volcano, but despite a very original and well-designed game, too lightweight to hold up after 1/2 a dozen or so plays.

The game itself is fine. It's very 'take that' in nature, as players literally burn opponents pieces alive, and throw their charred remains into a hilarious excuse for a volcano, but that's all part of the fun. The pre-eruption phase of the game is pretty neat, and hosts most of the strategy offered in the game. Trying to balance the want for shear numbers and the need for exit access, makes placing your people fairly interesting, and the Omen cards allow for some tactical play here as well. The post-eruption phase is just anarchy, and hosts most of the game's theatre. Its a good mix of game and show, but nothing worth clamoring about.

RATING: 7.5
Funny game. Easy to explain and works great with the theme (despite the random appearance of the extra relatives after the first eruption card).

The Kalaha-like movement of the men after Vesuvio erupts makes for some interesting tactics but there's seriously nothing that beats throwing other people into the volcano or catching up to them with the lava.

RATING: 8
An enjoyable co-petitive game themed around the destruction of Pompeii.  More could probably have been done with it, but as it stands it is a thoroughly entertaining game.  The strategy of placing one's people on the historically-derived map is broken into two highly competitive stages of escalating importance.  Appeasing omens of doom adds a competitive dimension to this process and indulges everyone's dark side as they feed rivals to the volcano.  Once the eruption starts, a tense dance begins in which players attempt to evacuate their people from the city while simultaneously looking for opportunities to hinder their opponents.  The process is made more tricky by the need not to hinder one's own escape.

A decent Survive! style game. Ultimately, it's not as good as survive because of the fixed value of all the pieces and the non-modular board. Still, if a copy of Survive wasn't available, I'd still be happy to play this title.

There are many things which this game could have done right. The Omen Cards are unecessarily random. It would have been better giving each player a chance to invoke Omen, rather than leave it to the luck of the draw. Placement of people is also unecessarily random. A player can easily get a rash of relatives just for having the right cards and benefit from others' placement. But the game is short and can work as a filler. The real saving grace is the theme, which is very engaging and the game is fun, getting to fry people in general!

[1 play] This was reasonably fun, though there were a couple of things I didn't like about it.  The way the lava does not flow from the volcano, but bubbles up at lava fountains throughout the town, is thematically senseless.  And I didn't like that the winner was obvious some time before the end of the game.  That wouldn't always happen, of course.  I do want to play this again sometime, as I have a much better understanding of how to play the first phase now that I've played the game through once.  My tip for next time: Try to stay close to all the other players, so that they won't want to block your exits.

(After [b]2[/b] plays) The first two phases of pawn placement tend to feel a bit too random to be enjoyable, but once the volcano starts erupting everyone will probably be too excited about engulfing their opponents in lethal lava flows to care very much about the lack of strategic depth.

Ruben: Much better as a 4-player than a 2-player.

Mel: Like the simple premise and easy-to-explain play. A quick not-filler-but-in-between game. Not so sure about the Omen cards, especially in a 2 player game. I find it near impossible to overcome the disadvantage in the 2nd half of the game if you've been inequitably affected by them. I'd seriously consider the house rule someone suggested of a 3/5/7 limit depending on no. of players.

RATING: 7.5
Interesting little filler game that has two distinct halves. The fill-up-town phase and the run-for-your-lives phase. 

The intital phase is card reliant and you suffer if you do not draw similar cards to your opponents however if you do too well here players notice you have more pieces than them and thus into the volcano you go whenever there is an omen drawn. 

There is a really interesting mechanic for flocking together, but and the same time you wish for all your pieces to be spread throughout the city. There is some nice strategy there, such as if my piece is stood with yours you are not going to put lava over your own piece so mine is 'safe' too but if all players bar one flock to the same location that space looks mighty tempting to the player that doesn't have a piece stood there.

The second phase is entirely different to the first worker placement phase. This phase has tile laying and movement point allowances as you rush to have all your meeple flee before they burn to a crisp.

Tile placement is straightforward you must place the lave flow adjacent to the symbol that appears on the tile, the new dual sides tiles are a really nice addition as you are able to choose a little more where you wish the lava to flow. Tile placement also happens before you are allowed to move so you can't flee and then burn everyone you left behind.

You then have two movement actions where each movement allowance is the number of meeple initially in the square. This is a very interesting mechanic as you wish to piggyback off other players pieces but don't want to wait so long you get left behind and have to plod towards the exit gateways as lava creeps closer.

I really enjoyed the game and there is novelty in throwing opponents meeple into the volcano however the number of meeple in the volcano as a tie breaks doesn't really seem to work as several of us has the same number of crispy meeple. I wish the initial placement phase was longer and I may try a variant whereby players have a hand of three cards instead of four thus the deck is larger to see how this affects gameplay.

Components are really good except for the cloth bag which feels very cheap. The volcano is sturdy plastic and fits together very well and the artwork used is really nice and the theme fits very well. Overall really happy with this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A hit for me, although it has a negative element. You lay numbered/coloured cards to put your people in the city. Then the volcano erupts and you place lava tiles, and start moving your people out through the gates. Any that get burnt or trapped are dropped into the crater (and become the tie-break). The most escapees wins, the least in the crater is the tie-break.

Quick, simple decisions and fun, but you are attacking the other players and actively killing people, which is macabre.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Fun and tense survival game for the family.  Some choices feel light on strategy, but once the lava starts flowing the game shifts gears to a higher level with suspense and great sense of unavoidable dread.  A unique game that's tense and provides some occassional excitement.  More of an "experience" than a game, but it is still worth the ride!  Grade: B

Move with your family and relatives to the flourishing city of Pompeii, before racing them to safety when the Vesuvius erupts!

There are choices, but they're rather meaningless.
Relatives are an interesting mechanic, but the omen cards are too random and have a huge impact on the result of the game.
In 2-player games lava flows too slowly and I think there should be a few more lava tokens; the endgame seems to play itself and the outcome has already been decided previously, so the lava phase feels even more of a drag. Let me choose 2 of the 6 lava groups, and let me place one new lava tile for each! If I can't place 2, drop that groups thing and make all the lava the same!

This game can be fun only if you're having a laugh with your friends while you burn their family and relatives.

In the first phase meeples are moved into Pompeii, in the second phase those same people are then evacuated again while Vesuvius unloads its lava on the city. Everyone tries to get their own people to safety while at the same time gobbling everyone else with the lava streams.

Both the placement and evacuation phases are controlled by randomly drawn cards or tiles, respectively. The decisions to make are usually pretty obvious (move into buildings close to the city gates, preferably those which are already inhabited to get a maximum number of meeples deployed; move away from lava towards the exits) and not particularly taxing. Neither do they have an especially strong impact on the game as a whole. Pompeii is a fine family game, although some may find it a bit confrontational for that, and I'm sure those who simply like to throw their opponents into a volcano will have a hoot, too. There is not a lot of substance beneath the layers of ash and fire, however.

Downfall of Pompeii is a thematically excellent game (even if it's not really that accurate to the history).  It's pretty random at the beginning. The placement phase was obviously designed to just get the pieces out in a random, but somewhat evenly spread manner. But the Omen cards keep things spicy and the Relatives rule allows for some tactical placement options.  The real game is in the second phase where the lava comes out to destroy Pompeii! This is where the fun is - slightly gimmicky with the 3D volcano, but it is part of the charm. You do have to put some thought into tile placement and movement, so that works just enough to keep you into it until the game ends. Overall, DoP has quite a few aching moments and even a spot of tension, but is a little too simple and random to have any serious depth. Still, it wins on enough notes to be a happy inclusion to my gaming library!

New game to us, only 2 plays but I loved it.  (I won both times which doesn't hurt).  The volcano is a little bonus which adds to the fun of the game.  I must admit dropping his players into the volcano made me smile.  The combination of placement of villagers, laying tiles & then moving out of Pompeii was a nice switch up to the game.  Lots of strategy to be had here.
Update:  Finally played a 4 played version & now I love it even more.  Plus when I had to teach the game we learned we had the relative rule wrong..even better.  The people we taught want to borrow the game now.  Not so sure I'm ready to part with it right now!

It's lightweight, deliciously morbid fun. The first phase is citizen placement where you even encourage your relatives to move into the doomed city.

We like to have more citizens on the board when Vesuvius erupts! So we use a house rule for where to insert the AD79 card (the 2nd time).
Instead of shuffling it into the bottom 15 cards of the deck; we place it:
in the bottom 12 cards for 2 player games
in the bottom  9 cards for 3 player games
in the bottom  8 cards for 4 player games

We also limit the Omen cards for 2 player games. If you draw an Omen card, instead of discarding it, play it face up in front of the player you're using it on. You can't play an Omen card on a player that has 2 more face up Omens in front of him than you do.


If a player runs out of pieces he has the option to call for an early eruption, as one does when one's cards are all for full buildings.

Thank you BGG Secret Santa 2017!

While it's all right, it's nothing spectacular. A quick game, and being an excellent one for kids, families, and 'lighter' gamers. Not for anyone looking for in-depth game play, or anything requiring much strategy. 

The kids absolutely love this. The best part and when they have the most fun is when they get to toss the people in the volcano. Recommended for kids and families both. It's fast, and easy to play, even for my 6 year old.

Enjoyable, short game. 2 phases, a placement phase, where you're trying to hedge your bets, while taking advantage of opportunities to put people on the board, and the volcano phase, where you're running away from hot lava death while inflicting it on the other players. Fun. Quite a lot of luck, but strategic movement important.

The game plays nicely, the fact that the player who has more citizens on the board after the first part has more problems in the second part is a nice balancing mechanism- the cardboard volcano is very flimsy though.

Light game of putting pieces on a board, then moving them off while avoiding obstacles placed in the way.  The tile-laying part is largely out of your control so it doesn't feel like your choices in the first half make much difference to the outcome of the second.  Bit of a silly tacked-on theme, too (lava that comes up through cracks in the ground in Pompeii?).We'll give it another shot, but if it's as big of a yawn the second time, I'll trade it away.

Traded it away.

This game was a HUGE hit at home over Christmas. My brother-in-law even tried to find it in Target (haha). I consider it some kind of chaotic fun, always a good time. Works well from 2-4 players. Don't expect it to be a deeply strategic experience. Do expect to get ganged up on if you are either in the lead or have a reputation for winning.

I have played the game on Yucata in the Yucathatlon, a competition against the podcasters Si and Mike on Into the gamescape. That meant in practice that we played it as a team game, which I think is a little less chaotic. I found it a little dull to be honest, but I think I would like it more with physi-cal components and smack talk. It is certainly a “take that” kind of game.

Fun interaction and a fairly accessible ruleset for non-gamers. However, it only plays 4, so it doesn't see as much action around here.

A fantastic game that a newer player can advance past a tile laying game such as Carcassonne due to it lava laying mechanic. I would have to say that the only drawback for this game would be the card set up. Setting the cards up for the volcano is a mess AND the rulebook does not tell you that the pegs are set out in a certain order for 2-3-4 player games... I love yellow and cannot play in 2 player... for shame!

I finally acquired this thanks to a generous local gamer who decided to clean out his closet.

The family loves it and it has many plays in its future. It has a "take that" feel of Survive Atlantis but is really a different game. Both games will be on the shelf at the same time.

With some good press a reprint of this would do very well. I was so desperate I was going to get a picture of a board and make my own game. Who knows, I might still upload the stuff for somebody.

Light and fun.  I think it appears to have more strategy than it really has.  But, the theme is great, and usually it's more about managing risk and randomness than just being totally screwed over.  I could certainly do without the Omen cards, which add a pointless screw-the-leader aspect.

RATING: 6.5
Light game that transitions through 3 phases.  Phase 1 and 2 you essentially seed the city full of people, and you run for your life in phase 3, with the goal of saving the most people possible from player-controlled lava flows. 

It is embarrassingly satisfying to sacrifice an opponent's game piece to the 3D volcano on the game board.. and even more so when you flow over a group of them with lava in phase 3.  

Still gets occasional table time.

Downfall of Pompeii is a game of two halves, fueled by hand management and some tile placement. At first, players play cards to place pieces on the board in certain houses. Then, partway through the game, lava will begin to flow and now it is time to escape the city with the pieces earlier placed. Pompeii is a perfect level of depth for what it tries to achieve. Games are light and breezy, but offer just enough strategic depth where choices are meaningful yet low steaks. The components are great, in a quirky board game way. It is fun tossing tokens into the volcano as the lava flows expand. Pompeii is immediately appealing and approachable.

RATING: 8
In the one game I've played so far (with 4 players) I had the fewest people out on the board in the first round, but ended up winning (with only one other player coming close).  So, in a way, the beginning round seems kind of arbitrary, and there can be a high luck factor both with the card draws in the first round and the lava tile draws in the volcano phase, but apparently placing your people carefully in the first round (combined with some luck in the volcano phase) can make some difference as far as winning or losing. Regardless, it's a very quick and really fun game and I would definitely play it whenever offered.

RATING: 6.5
The Downfall of Pompeii is one of those rare games wherein my opinion has improved dramatically over time.  The first time I played, I was expecting a deeper game, filled with drama and strategic options.  I was disappointed, and found the lengthy placement portion of the game to be quite dull.  The race for the exits was better, and more fun, but it didn’t salvage the game.  Fortunately, I did give the game another chance, and found that I enjoyed the experience considerably more.  I believe it was a matter of accepting the game for what it is:  a light, fun romp.  While there are some decisions to be made, the game isn’t a deep strategic affair.  Rather, it is seems meant to be little more than a fun pastime.  In that light, it succeeds brilliantly.

While still not terribly titillating, the placement phase does have its purpose.  Decisions must be made where to place citizens.  Do you place them in buildings near the gates, so they can make quick exits when the volcano erupts?  Do you try to take advantage of the "relative" rule to place numerous citizens with as many placements as possible, knowing that this will likely cause you to bear the brunt of the omen cards?  Do you place into the somewhat safer central part of the city, hoping to make fast sprints to the exits and outrun the lava flows?  These are important decisions, but none of them seem to be that critical, as there are pros and cons to each approach, and ultimately they all seem to be of fairly equal value.

Choosing which citizens to move on a turn seems even less important, as the lava appears in a very random fashion.  A safe spot can suddenly become dangerous and untenable, while a building located adjacent to a lava flow may go turn-after-turn without being engulfed.  Generally, the idea is to save who you can, and abandon the rest.  Cruel, but effective.

I’m happy to see Mayfair bringing this game to a wider audience.  It is virtually identical to the original Amigo version, with the only real change being an improved, plastic volcano to replace the fragile paper original.  I’m not sure just how much appeal the game will have with the general public, as the deadly theme is certainly to cause some consternation and objections in some circles.  For those willing to look past such things, however, The Downfall of Pompeii offers a fun gaming experience and stands in stark contrast to the grim tragedy of the actual event.

Menekülj, amíg nem késő…
Már az elején tisztázzuk le. Ez egy olyan játék, amiben a résztvevők egymással tolnak ki. Ez a játék része, nem kerülhető el. Így az érzelmesebb lelkületű játékosok keressenek mást maguknak.
Még a játék kipróbálása előtt felkeltette érdeklődésemet a játék alapszituációja: Pompeji városának pusztulása. Szerintem ezt mindenki ismeri. A játék ezt az alapot kiaknázva 2 részben teszi próbára a játékosokat. A legbonyolultabb dolog a húzópakli elkészítése lesz, mert a szabályok egyszerűek. Alapból 4 kártyával indulsz, majd egyet-egyet kijátszva körödben próbálod a nálad lévő lakosokat a legjobb helyekre letenni. Ám egyszer a vulkánunk füstölögni kezd és új szelek fújnak a városban. Most már minden jó helyre letett lakosodért plusz rokonokat hozhatsz be és néha egy-egy lakost szépen feláldoznak az Isteneknek. Sajnos ez sem segít és a vulkán ki fog törni. A láva elszabadul a városban, majd a játékosok először a gonosz vulkán képében tovább terjesztik a bezúduló lávát, majd megpróbálják a legtöbb lakosukat kimenekíteni a városból. Előre szólók, hogy mindet nem tudod megmenteni. Ha ezzel a ténnyel meg tudsz birkózni, remek élményben lehet részed. Bár a vulkánból folyó láva megjelenése és terjedése szerencsefüggő (igaz a játék vége felé ki lehet számolni, hogy mi van még a húzózsákban), azonban a játék elején mindenképpen taktikázni kell és azért dolgozni, hogy a második részben minél több rokont hozz a játékba. Hogy az a célszerűbb, ha egy helyre összpontosítod lakosaidat vagy szétszóród őket a városban, már legyen az a feladvány, amelyet játék közben tudsz megfejteni. :)

RATING: N/A
It's a fun game that plays in an hour, and I love the 2 distinct flavored "phases" to the game. The first half is tactical card play to try to get a sufficient # of meeples on the board. Then... all of a sudden... Mt. Vesuvius strikes and the cards are immediately put away and it becomes a tile-laying game of survival. Stay clear of the red tiles! Run for your lives!!! There's (temporarily) safety in numbers.

For some reason the game came pre-designed with a dwindling # of colored pawns. So for a 2 player game, you use 2 exact colors. For a 3 player game, you use the same 2 colors + a 3rd, etc. Just thought I would mention that in case you notice there isn't the same # of tokens per color. I think it was a silly excuse to save a $ buck or two on the production.

An okay euro-family-filler type of game.  Lots of luck, but you do get to throw guys into a volcano.  Not enough strategic depth to get much replay time, but if you have half an hour to kill or you want a good game to play with kids this is a good choice.  Components are typical eurogame boring, with the exception of the volcano on the board which is pretty cool.

RATING: 6
Only one play, need to get a couple more in to really get a feel for it. That said, here are my initial impressions.

The comparisons to Survive are not without merit. Certainly thematically I can see why this is the case. Unfortunately, compared to Survive, there seem to be far fewer important decisions. Survive is often a matter of predicting what others will do, deciding how risky to be with the rolls of the creatures, and even bluffing about values. On the other hand, Pompeii seems to simply have optimal or sub-optimal choices. Place extra people if you can. Kill other people with lava if you can. If you can get someone out, you should. If you can't, you should get them as close as possible. These very simple and obvious rubrics seem to govern the entire game. Ultimately, this just seems a bit too shallow for my tastes. But again, the first glance is not always correct so I want to give this one another couple plays to be sure.

[Initial Impression: 8]
This morbidly-themed game erupts into surprising bouts of fun.  The game is played in two stages: first players place their residents into buildings governed by card play, then the volcano erupts and players attempt to move their residents out of the city to safety while placing lava tiles to impede their opponents. During the first phase, there is a lot of luck of the draw, with some spots on the board being closer to exits and therefore more desirable.  There's also a mechanism of "relatives" where you get to place more residents if the building you enter already contains residents.  If you don't draw the cards for buildings where others have been placing residents, you'll get to place fewer total residents than other players.  However, the player with the most residents on the board is not necessarily at an advantage, because they may not have enough turns to get all of their residents out of the city.  Plus, having more residents means that you'll likely get targeted by the lava tiles from other players and that you'll have more residents in the volcano at the end, which means that you'll lose in the event of a tie.  The strategy is all about trying to set yourself up in the first phase, given the cards you hold, to quickly escape in the second phase.  But the second phase, after the volcano erupts, is where all the fun resides.  Who can resist tossing their friends into the volcano to burn? And what's better than the satisfaction of barely escaping from the lava flows? The game plays fast enough that you can go several bouts in the same session, and the fun factor is hard to over-estimate.

It's a silly little game about meeple placement and getting out of Dodge, when the volcano blows up. Quick and light, not to be taken seriously, but when your meeples are on the line, you'll do anything to save them a la The Poseidon Adventure. There is a semi-cooperative feel, where larger groups of meeples move farther than singletons, but it is ruthless when placing those lava flows. Great fun for about 30 to 45 minutes.

Somewhat grotesque theme that of course provokes perverse giggling.  The shuffling seemed to throw off the middle of the game.. I will have to check that I did it correctly.  As for the game itself, it has an abstract strategy feel to it.  Part I feels like setup, Part II like the actual game.  Planning ahead is good. Fair light game, though it is somewhat convoluted for a game fitting this description. (2 plays)

The best game to play at the end of a mammoth game night.  When it's 2 or 3AM and people are still asking for more games, Pompeii is a riot.

--- March 17, 2011 ---

The Survive rerelease is likely to supplant Pompeii on my game table, so I traded Pompeii away as a rider on a math trade. Got 4 Game Boy Advance games (Final Fantasy I & II: Dawn of Souls, Metroid: Zero Mission, Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts, and Tetris Worlds) in return.

--- May 6, 2012 ---

Oh, how I regret trading this one away. Though Survive is indeed a good game, Pompeii is still the best. And now it seems to be out of print :( Hopefully I can snag it in a trade or somebody brings it back.

First played July 5th, 2007.  It takes about 10 minutes to be taught the basics and about 45 minutes to play.  It has a good balance of luck and skill.  It has a take-that elemement in it as well, so it may be more luck weighed now that I think of it.  It's a great game for those who like the take-that element and others for that matter.  Place your pauwns down in the village and when the lava starts flowing, get as many as you can out as possible.  I'd highly recommend this game and give it cosideration in playing in your rotation of games to play on a regular basis.

Enjoyed the chaos and the meanness the game provides. Meanness that is light-hearted yet involves strategic decision which can be destroyed by randomness.

It's a silly game similar to Survive the Sinking of Atlantis (basically a screw your friends game).  Set out people into the city, pack buildings with your relatives, throw your opponents into the volcano, then try to run away when the lava starts to flow through the streets.  Very simple, lots of laughs.

Another www.yucata.de game.

Clever game.  The mechanics work well.  If the unique, but somewhat morbid, theme doesn't bother you, the game can be fun.

Since perfect information regarding scoring and potential scoring is available once endgame approaches, the leader (or perceived leader) is going to be picked on by the other players.  Of course, if the other players don't pull the 'right' lava tiles to incinerate or cut off the leader's people . . . 

Based on a limited sample size, the game is much better with 3 or 4 players.  Not yet sold on this one as a two player game (an unequal draw of Omen cards can really tilt the game).  If I had to guess, I'd say the 'sweet spot' for the game is 3 players.

Overall, not a great game, but a reasonably good one.  Not convinced that there are a lot of different strategies to employ though, so not sure about how much replayability there is.

Meeples & Volcano.  Enough said.

It *was* fun to chuck meeples in the volcano.  But really the rules overhead almost got to me.  Maybe I just need to try it again.

It was fun, but it just didn't seem to matter much what you did.  I suppose if you view it as a game of risk management, it could be taken on a deeper level.

Played this a few times, and each time left me less than satisfied. The whole first part of the game is almost pointless in my opinion, as it doesn't really matter how many pieces you got in the city - as you can only move one each turn (in the second half). Having a lot of pieces may give you some extra choices, but less than you would think, instead it just means you have that much more people who will be eaten by the lava.

Hah, what a fun game. Any game that allows you to throw people into a volcano and recommends that you make noises while doing so is an excellent game in my book! It's made up of two phases that each play as a unique game. In the first phase you put people into the city by playing cards. The second phase comes when the volcano errupts. The game switches over to a tiling laying game of lava. If the lava covers a space with people in it, into the volcano they go!

Excellent, fun, family game.

First play with 3. Despite the potential of the theme, this game seems very dry. The first phase of the game (placement of your citizens) is not particularly interesting as the decision-making is relatively trivial. However Der Untergang von Pompeji livens up for the second phase (saving your citizens), which requires some tactical thought.

I'm not sure how much strategy there is in this game.  Still pretty fun though.  The rule where, in the case of a tie, the player with the fewest people in the volcano wins, seems backwards to me.  I would prefer to play where the player with the most people in the volcano wins in the case of a tie score, so that the player who got attacked the most gets the benefit.

If you want to turn your brain off a bit and enjoy the ride, this might hit the spot well.  As an experience, I enjoyed it.  As a game, it leaves something to be desired.

The Euro version of 'Survive'  

A light fun very well themed game easy to teach and learn with a little take that runs 30 to 45 minutes which is similar to Survive in all those ways. I think there could be just a very small touch more strategy here but the difference is a pittance really, the bigger difference could be a slight bit more chaos in Survive but that is arguable also as slight temporary alliances can be formed in Survive. So then the biggest difference for me is Survive does seem just slightly more fun and this is partly due to the chaos and action that starts right away in the game where as the first half or so of Pompeii you are trying to place your guys as close to the exits as possible.  

They both have roughly the same amount of luck which is substantial but not a problem at this game length or weight. I prefer the aspect of Survive which utilizes hidden values of the people and the intrigue, guessing and bluffing that it introduces which adds a little more fun IMO, Pompeii is missing this aspect but it could be added I think (sharpie) which would up the fun a little more and also add a another slight strategic element. 

Now don't get me wrong I think this game definitely stands on its own just fine, however undeniably both games are quite similiar and scratch the same itch. Both are also good at what they were designed to do so for me owning just one suffices and I would be happy with either but glad I have Survive for the hidden value aspect. 

Overall a very well themed gateway game for 2 - 4 or occasional fun filler for weeknights. It plays like a meaty filler and when regarded as such its quite good for what it is in that sense.

Definitely silly fun - there's strategy to be had, but it's probably about 70% luck based.

Biggest drawback is setting up the card deck, which is very fiddly indeed.

Probably the most absurdly themed game I've played recently.  I have to give it props for actually having a card that requires you to throw your opponent's citizens into Vesuvius as a sacrifice.  And the paper volcano was cool to look at, but then the Brady Bunch episode where the boys build a volcano for a science project was always my favorite.  For actual game play, it was just okay.

One play (4/24/10), and no real desire to play it again. I wouldn't turn down a game of it if others wanted to play, but it doesn't excite me. - The first phase didn't seem to have much to do with the second phase's outcome, and it certainly wasn't much 'fun'. The second phase, with the placing of lava tiles, was more fun, but there didn't seem to be much good reason to make any specific decision on who to move.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (January 2011)

My last The Downfall of Pompeii game was a long time ago. It is a game similar to Survive, but I like Survive better. I never liked much the game and I’m not sure why. It seems to me that the game doesn’t have much in the strategy department. Most moves are kind of obvious and it has lots of “take that” and “attack the current leader”, which I don’t enjoy now. It also has a lot of uncontrollable luck (but at least it plays very quick).

Perhaps I would have liked the game better as a kid, but these days I see no point in playing it.

Bottom line, The Downfall of Pompeii can a be a good family game, however it is way too light for my current tastes. The decisions are rather obvious and luck plays a large factor in the victory.

Ok so the setup is geologically and historically inaccurate and has thematic inconsistancies, but you just can't go past dropping lava on the heads of your friends' pompeeples and tossing them into the volcano. Played with 2,4,5 players and had fun every time.

I had a ton of fun with this. It brought back the fun of Survive! (a.k.a Escape From Atlantis). 

I just really enjoyed it. It's full of interactions, laughter (with good spirited players), tactical reactions (once the lava starts flowing), and some decent setup up strategy in planning for the mayhem.

The tossing of the other player's guys into the volcano allows for very tight games once you've seen it in action...besides, it's just fun to make sizzling noises.

A light game, not one to play a million times in a row, but great to bring out. One that I just enjoyed for playing and it works with a wide range of players and families.

There is a chance that bad sports could go nuts when their little wooden bits go into a paper volcano because of a cardboard square drawn at random, (though, admittedly placed with intent); and if that happens, the poor sport will have clearly shown that they have forgotten that it's a game, but I've not run into that and would be stunned if I did.

This is a wonderful family-friendly (... and maybe not so friendly) game of hand management and area control that plays out in two distinct phases.  Place as many of your people as close to the 7 exit gates as possible to ensure their chances of getting out in time before Mount Vesuvius suddenly and unexpectedly decides to exercise her mighty wrath (insert sound effects here).  There's a great deal of satisfaction in placing a lava tile in front of an exit gate just before your opponent has a chance to escape to safer ground (again, more sound effects)

Mwha,ha,ha,ha,haaaaa... I LOVE this game!

NOTE: Finally made it to Pompeii, Italy earlier this summer ('07).... absolutely awesome!

An excellent, excellent game.  

While it's not "heavy" on strategy, there's plenty of strategy available here.  Don't listen to those discounting this game as a luck-fest (though, admittedly, more luck is introduced with more players).    

The game takes place over two distinctly different (yet related) phases.  These two phases feel quite different mechanically and, yet, remain cohesive and thematic.  This is great accomplishment in streamlined game design that offers a lot of replayability.  I would welcome an edition with better/updated artwork, but the components are quite sufficient as is (note: I have the older edition, which I hear is superior in its component quality).  

This is an anchor in my collection.

I think with four players my rating goes down to a six. A bemused six, to be sure, but three random draws between turns provides enough chaos to mute the cleverness of the design.

This is a fun game of surviving an erupting volcano. For the first part of the game you place your pieces where you think will be easiest for them to escape the city. In the second round as the volcano erupts you move your pieces out of the city to safety. It offers just enough strategy to keep it interesting.

A game that totally changes mechanics halfway through and manages to do it really well. You spend the first half of the game trying to get the most people into the city, and the second half trying to get them out alive. The best part of this game is throwing people in the volcano, of course. My fiancée loves this one and I enjoy it quite a bit as well.

I had a blast with this game.  The 2 phases (get people into buildings, then try to escape) were fun, and even when I wasn't doing well, it was a blast trying to set up other people to fry!  I may have enjoyed this too much!  Not necessarily the best game ever, and quite enjoyable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Based on one play with four people.  Very dramatic for a light game -- love the tension of trying to escape the lava flow and the way the city becomes increasingly desolate.

My one qualm is the subtle quirks in the rules, as the game moves through what are really four distinct phases.  At different phases you have to change your focus from whether a building is the same color, to whether it is separate from another building of the same color, and then to city squares instead of buildings.  I'm eager to try this with my family, but a little apprehensive about whether they will tolerate the subtleties of the rules.  It definitely is more fiddly than say Ticket to Ride.

Surprisingly fun, rich, and quick game with a fun theme (well, as long as it's not happening to me). Not sure how I'd missed this one entirely. The game switches roughly midway from placing "workers" to getting them out of town before the lava hits. It can be amusingly confrontational to wipe out your opponents with lava tiles or to cut off their escape route.

Way more nastiness than in your typical German game, but that's not a bad thing (as long as all players are prepared for it).

Some of the rules don't make much sense (what's the deal with the relatives?), but the game plays quickly enough to not overstay its welcome.

The volcano adds a nice touch to the game.

A pretty good representation of a volcano erupting game. The game takes place over 2 phases, (i) placing the people and (ii) mad lava chaos. Thematically quite good although I did find the omen cards a bit off (I drew 3-in-a-row and "was forced" to use it to attack the leader).

Dropping people into an active volcano has never been so much fun.  I prefer to make the "Aaaaaaa....Sssssss!" noise when I drop them in, but you can choose your own sound effects.  Best music to go with the game?  Burning down the house, of course.  
But, really, there is a good game in there.  Fairly quick turns and decisions that matter add to the carnage fun.

Very interesting game where you first get to place all your people. Then, after we've ignored all those smoke plumes and still kept stuffing people in the city, the time comes to escape.

Involves quite some fun hand management aspects. While very controlled with two, I can see it also be a bit more chaotic fun with more.

RATING: 7
Good game. Reminds me a little of Mammoth Hunters in that there're two phases, placement and mass destruction. There are some rules ambiguities - what happens when someone runs out of people to place? The rules don't say, and this can be of vital importance, considering how well-balanced the game seems.

Survive! is a better game.  This game goes too far out of its way to be balanced for how light it is.  Also, I don't really like the octagonal people, but no other players have complained.  Given that drawing more Omen cards can make or break the game, I find it surprising that the designer went out of his way to stack the deck so precisely.  Also, what is up with the mechanic that you move faster out of a square with more dudes in it?  I still really like this game, though, since you can scream as you throw them into the volcano.

A relatively quick-playing, Survive-type game with a more Euro feel. Hits its stride with 4 players; 2 and 3 feel less successful. A little random but strategy does exist in careful placement and moving the right pieces at the right time, as well as knowing what you have to sacrifice to succeed.

It's a very interesting game. you could play it up to 4 players but what I truly think is that they should make the board bigger so they can have more people playing than just 4. They should also make the volcano with baking soda and vinegar so it erupts so it would be more of a rush as it flows across the board which would have to be plastic. They should have figures instead of blocks and flat buildings on the board otherwise it is just dull but otherwise it's a very good game.

The game falls into two halves: before and after the eruption of Vesuvius. Before the eruption, players play cards to place their pieces in buildings. After the first eruption, they can also place as many relatives as the number of pieces already in the building they placed their piece in. When Omen cards are drawn, the player can take any opponent's piece and throw it into the erupting volcano. In this manner, players try to get as many pieces onto the board as close to the exits from the city as possible.

After the second eruption, the game changes. Now each player places a lava tile, which kills any pieces on that square and may block exits from the city. Then they move two pieces toward the exits, moving them a number of squares equal to the pieces on the square from which they started. The player who gets the most pieces out of the city wins.

It's a 2 phase game where the planning and strategy in the first phase is almost not important to the second phase. They could have just placed tokens randomly on the board then start the 2nd phase and the results would have been the same. Also the fact the you perform well in the first phase has really few influence on if you are going to win in the second phase.

This game is okay, but the first two rounds are so boring and tedious that we never get around to playing it.  The third round is fun and a good game in itself, but the whole thing is too long.

RATING: 5
Fun thematic game and the challenge builds up as things get "hot" in Pompeii and players try to position themselves within the city in order to exit the volcanic lava and ashe.  

However, after a subsequent playing, I find that it's a little underwhelming in that not all locations or squares are balanced.  I don't believe that all squares have a "relatively equivalent" threat of lava moving on to that square.  There are too few lava tiles per symbol and the whole city does not get engulfed in lava.  (This is suppose to be the Titanic and this luxury liner/ship must sink, in the end.)  I believe that if each of the six lava symbols have at least 2 to 4 more tiles in the draw bag, that will create sufficient lava threat to all squares in the city.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Fun, light game.  There is some valid criticism that omen cards can have too much influence, especially in a 2 player game, but the theme of fleeing from lava is just outstanding. Edit: I just played a 2 player game in which my opponent got 5 omen cards to my 0 and I still won the game, so maybe the omen cards aren't as important as I thought.

Added: I have just introduced this to my children, age 6 & 5.  Not only can they play decently, they absolutely love throwing people in the volcano and screaming.

Added:  My children are now 10 & 9 and still love the game.

RATING: 7
A bit in the mold of Survive! you seek to get as many of your pawns to safety outside the city as possible.  Three phases exist within the game:  1) initial placement of individual pawns based on card draw, 2) placement of more pawns based on card draw and an opportunity to place additional relatives (more pawns) based on number of pawns already in building, 3) the volcanoe erupts and you just lay a lava tile (hopefully burying your opponents in the lava flow) and move 2 of your pawns a certain number of spaces (based on number of pawns in starting square).  Fun game as long as everyone is fully aware this is an elimination game and not a friendly game...

RATING: 8
Ez egy kis helyigényű, nagyon könnyen tanulható, hangulatos, könnyed, gonoszkodós játék. Kifejezetten ajánlható a társasjátékokkal épp csak ismerkedőknek is.

Két részből áll a játék. Az első részben Pompei városának benépesítésével telik, a játékosok véletlenszerűen húzott kártyalapok segítségével próbálnak minél több embert a városba telepíteni. Itt elég kevés a lehetőség a stratégiázásra, szerencsefüggő, hogy ki milyen lapokat húz, ezáltal mely épületekbe rakhatja az embereit, de olyan nagyon nagy jelentősége talán nincs is. A fázis végére nagyjából ugyanannyi embere lesz mindenkinek Pompeiben. Persze, gonoszkodni már itt is lehet: az Omen kártya felhúzásakor egy tetszőleges embert a városból a vulkánba lehet dobni, onnantól az a bábu kikerül a játékból. A vulkán a város mellett van, egy papírból készült csúcs nélküli kúpot kell elképzelni, amibe igen jó érzés az ellenfél emberkéit bedobálni. Hangulatból ötös.

Amikor már nagyjából telepakolták a játékosok a várost az embereikkel, egyszer csak kitör a vulkán. Innentől aztán végképp gonoszkodóssá válik a játék: a játékosok felváltva irányítják a várost elpusztító lávát, hogy merre folyjon, és minden a láva útjába kerülő bábu rögtön a vulkánba kerül. A láva irányításán felül még két lépésnyit mozgatják is a játékosok a bábujaikat, akiknek célja, hogy elérjék a város valamelyik kapuját és megmeneküljenek a vulkán elől. Tehát mindenki rohan a kijáratok felé, mögöttük hömpölyög a láva, az emberek pedig sorra válnak a vulkán áldozatává, néhányan meg megmenekülnek. Az győz, akinek a legtöbb embere kijut élve a városból.

Van még pár szabály, amiktől még élvezetesebbé válik a játék. Az egyik, hogy a benépesítés fázisban ha olyan épületbe rakjuk a bábunkat, ahol már vannak egyéb emberek is, annyi extra embert felrakhatunk, amennyien voltak abban az épületben (persze nem rekurzívan). A másik, hogy meneküléskor annyi mezőnyit tud lépni egy-egy ember, ahányan a kiinduló mezőjén álltak.

A játékidő elég rövid, gyorsan megy a játék, nagyon keveset kell a többiekre várni, senki nem unatkozik.

Mint írtam ez egy nagyon hangulatos, szórakoztató játék, amit nem szabad, de nem is lehet túl komolyan venni. Gonoszkodni lehet és muszáj is benne, ezért nagyon sértődősöknek nem ajánlott. Mindenki másnak viszont igen. Ez a játék az interakcióról szól, folyamatosan hatnak egymásra a játékosok, itt senki nem magának játszogat, állandó a kölcsönhatás. Stratégia nem sok van benne, ez inkább egy taktikai játék, amikor mindig az adott helyzetből próbáljuk a legtöbbet kihozni. Elsőre is tökéletes játékélményt nyújt, és egy kezdő is legyőzheti azt, aki más rengetegszer játszott vele. Ez egy tényleg szórakoztató, könnyed játék, amit szívesen vesz elő az ember. Ajánlom.

Quick, fun light area control game. First half is placing your citizens out in the city; second half of the game you're running for the hills as the lava envelops the city. Great 3D volcano. We all enjoyed throwing each other into the volcano when lava hit our citizens. I recommend this game for a wide variety of ages and gaming abilities. Fun gateway game. "For extra fun add one of those little battery operated mini-candles from the dollar store to the volcano."

Note, if you have the earlier edition: ""The original edition manual states 140 wood pieces, but that it is a misprint. The total in fact is 127; 36 black, 36 red, 30 yellow, and 25 blue."

The game is just fun!  If there's one truth in life it's this: it's fun to toss people into a volcano!

RATING: 9
This game flew under my radar and I completely forgot how I heard about it.  Anyway, I made a blind buy and have not been disappointed.  There is some incorrect math in the rules about what cards get combined with what deck and how many cards you should have left over.  Don't let that discourage you.  I got really hung up on that and hadn't started playing until I figured out either the rules were incorrect or I was shorted cards in the deck.  Regardless, the game takes place in a few stages.  One, you place your Pompeii citizen markers in the town in various buildings.  Two, the volcano eventually blows its top and you start laying lava tiles while trying to evacuate your people.  Players take turns laying tiles so you can box someone in or just flat out drop a tile on them and wipe out everyone in a building.  Brilliant game!

Update (2009-05-22):
This is not a heavy strategy. Instead it is light fun with bit of "take that" thrown in. With this appropriate mindset, the game can be fun. Do not expect too much and you will not be disappointed.

Initial thoughts:
Although I like the idea of throwing people in a volcano, the mechanics for phase 1 and phase 2 seem mismatched and do not work very well together.

RATING: 5
[GAMEID=13004] feels like two games in one, although the first part just feels like a prolonged setup for the main game.  There is a little cardplay with moving your pieces into the city.  The volcano is then triggered and then there is a mad rush to get out of the city, with the ominous pieces of lava chasing after them.  Doomed meeples for some reason get ejected through the air into the volcano.  Unfortunately, dropping meeples into the volcano was not as fun as advertised.  It's a fairly light, more social game rather than a deeply analytical one (it felt much lighter than even [GAMEID=822] for example).

However, the game didn't sit well with us with just two players.  The cardplay in the first part of the game lacked any tension, as we were able to place our pieces without very much restriction.  The second part also didn't feel very tense.  Part of the reason is that you have so many pieces in the city and your turn comes up more often between placing lava tiles---with more players, there's more time for the lava to be a threat before you can move your meeples again.  

Although it seems like it should be a fun game, it just didn't work for us with two players.  Probably much better with more.

An area majority game, that I did enjoy, although to make a proper 'comment' about the game I think that I'd have to play it again.  I did do well on my first time, so I think there is potential there, but time will tell.

Had a nice theme, not knowing when the volcano was going to blow created a nice tension between the players.

The first half of the game is all about hand management, while the last half is all about good tile placement with the lava, and careful consideration of which pieces to move first. 

There is a large element of luck, but I have yet to lose a game after almost 10 plays, so that tells me there is more strategy here than meets the eye.

It's alot of fun, and as many other people have said, the chance to throw your opponents pieces into the volcano is just nasty fun.

I was pleasantly surprised by this one. The set up process is incorporated in the game though it is kind of slow only broken up by the screams of the occasional unlucky citizen as they get plunged into the volcano. The unsuspecting people of Pompeii get a rude awakening one day though as their nearby mountain explodes! Then it's a mad dash for the gates as the city filles up with bubbling molten rock. Eat your opponents and get your people out of the gates.

Picked up in Jan 2006

Cool game with an odd mix of mechanics. Some tough choices regarding the movement of your pieces to escape and lots of fun dropping lava tiles on your opponents and tossing their pieces into the volcano! Quite tactical in the fleeing phase, but it is easy to fall behind if you didn't get good opportunities to place in the first phase and/or lose lots of pieces to lava.

I scanned my original volcano and printed a new one that I mounted to stiffer cardboard.

Plays quickly enough that you can try again straight after and once you start playing is very easy to understand!

RATING: 6
A beautifully produced game that's a bit too light for regular play, but - problematically - seems too complex as a gateway. The different phases of the game make perfect sense for the theme, but make the game difficult to explain to a first-timer. Every game I've played has been extremely close, which makes me wonder if this game is perhaps a bit random. There's clearly some strategy, but it doesn't seem like there's enough time for a strategy to develop into an advantage.

This game is a blast!  It always seems to come out during our family gatherings and we have a lot of fun with it.  I'm not sure what it says about my family but we all start chanting and laughing as people get tossed into the volcano.  We can also be pretty ruthless when the lava starts flowing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
We really like this one. The first phase of the game seemed a bit mechanical at first but, once we played it a few times, it got more interesting. Some of the spots on the board are clearly more desirable than others, and there is a fair amount of fun involved in trying to stake out those locations. Also, the more people you can get on the board, the better the chances of getting them off the board. This makes for great competition, using the relative rule, to place people in nearly complete buildings.

Once the volcano erupts, the game gets really fun. You can almost feel the terror of trying to flee the molten lava. :-) Seriously, the challenge of balancing the desire to get people out of the city with the challenge of keeping others away from the lava is fun. Stomping your opponents with lava tiles is a blast. And, of course, there are all the requisite screaming sounds that need to be emulated as the people are consumed by lava and tossed into the volcano.

Overall, a light but fun game. Eventually, I am sure we will tire of the game, but for now it is high on our list.

The paradigm shift in the middle of this game is what makes it.  You go from filling Pompeii, to fleeing it like crazy.

But as long as people don't mind that, this is a wonderful family weight game.

RATING: 5
An enjoyable light eurostyle game with a great theme.  The lava phase is by far the more fun of the phases.  Make sure you shuffle the Omen cards well.  If they are all in a row - one person will benefit too much.  The beginning seeding of the cards is a pain and non-intiutive. The game felt too balancing to me as the more people you get to place in the first round, the more likeliehood that you will lose them to the lava.  Using wooden cylinders for people kind of takes away from the theme.  Maybe slightly larger tokens with pictures of running people would have been better.  Overall, this one misses the mark because it is too balanced and offers too little control for a gamer's game, but the placement phase of the game is too complicated (relatives) for a family game.

Amusing light game of positioning.  The theme is what prompted me to buy the game; if not for throwing people in a volcano and killing them with lava flows, I wouldn't have bothered.

The game set-up is a bit involved for a relatively light, short game.

This game is a lot of fun! The throwing of your citizens into the volcano is enjoyable albeit non-realistic and the rules of the game are easy to understand and teach to new players. I like that you have to use cards to place the citizens and then make a run for the cities entrances, only to learn that you've just been blocked by the raging lava flows! I have already played this twice and I feel that we'll be seeing more of this game in the future.

RATING: 9
Wow is this one a gem. The game plays in two phases, that each feel like a game in itself. Has a lot of interesting mechanics that are exciting. Playing a card gives you a meeple on the board, but waiting until other meeples are in that area allow you to place even more meeples, kind of like a combo. Then during the next phase you are laying lava tiles out onto the board and burning enemy's meeples and throwing them into the volcano!! In a take-that manner. Meanwhile trying to escape your dudes out of the city while the lava is flowing. Movement of meeples out of the city is equal to the amount of meeples on that square, giving it a bit of a mancala feel. You find yourself rooting for the lava, and taking an odd amount of pleasure in throwing other people into the volcano. This game is freaking awesome. It mixes mechanics with a refreshingly original theme. From the maker of Carcassonne, this game reminds most people of Survive: Escape from atlantis, however Pompeii is much better if you ask me.

A nice family euro, also suitable for gamers as a filler. The movement/tile placement phase was more interesting than the card playing phase. Would like to play again to see if there are more subtleties in hand management/initial placement.
--------------------
Okay, we had the card play wrong initially. Certainly some strategy, though not very heavy, in deciding which cards to keep and the order in which to play them during the relative rule portion of the phase. This really is a solid light euro. The only thing I am put off by is the omen cards, and that is a minor quibble. I suppose we could give each player two and let them choose when to use them to reduce luck a bit.

Initial rating after 1 2-player game. 
Fun game if you enjoy tossing other's civilians into the vulcano...

Update after some more games: easy rules, still fun. It feels almost as light as a filler, but it's that's more fun than your average filler, and the tactics versus luck ratio works for me. Rating goes up... Goes down well with every one I played it with so far. People love to toss meeple into the volcano.

Nice short playing time as well.

Update after half a year: This one hits the table more often than expected of such a relatively "light filler". It's simple, but with plenty of tension. The good thing is that the second part is the fun part with lots of tension.

NL: Probeer zoveel mogelijk van je eigen burgers te redden voordat Pompeii onder de lava bedolven wordt. (Fase 1: zoveel mogelijk poppetjes op het bord brengen. Fase 2: ren voor je leven!)

Fun with hot lava!  A two-part game of first placing your people, then trying to get them out of town.  Light-hearted and amusing.  Good opportunities to "mess" with your neighbor.  Rules are a tad bit complicated for the final effect.  Good medium-sized filler.

A very fun game (I've played with 4). It's very satisfying to toast your opponents.

Update: I couldn't get into the second game. The novelty of the volcano wore off and ... just not that interesting.

Game in a Nutshell: Move you and your extended family into Pompeii only to have the nearby volcano erupt soon after sending everyone fleeing for their lives. He who saves the greater number of their own family members wins!

Played as: 4 player (2 player on Yucata.de)

Pros: Ah, the fun of running from an exploding volcano. One of the best progression of phases to match a theme in any game I've played. The game isn't overly complex and an easy one to jump right into and teach while playing. Who doesn't want to throw your gaming partners / family members in a volcano from time to time? Well this game gives you that and it actually feels satisfying. Comes with a pretty sweet plastic volcano.

Cons: Has a few clunky rules (building the starting deck and relatives) and the first half of the game is nothing to get overly excited about. The game won't satisfy gamers looking for a heavy amount of control and strategy. A little too random to allow for a pure spiteful free-for-all, and spitefulness is where the game shines. 

Other: I imagine this game being an excellent family game. The rules aren't too much for the kiddies and they ought to love throwing Mom and Dad in the volcano. I guess I better start having kids so I can find out if I'm right. Until then, I guess I'll have fun watching cities and people burn with other adults. There's better games for two players.

Best Use: A light, semi-conflict game when you need to loosed up a bit.

A game with a lot of luck, but a really nice bit of gameplay which involves running from the erupting volcano.

Running from a volcano is entertaining.

A fairly light tactical game with a great theme and two parts: Part One has players placing their villages around Pompeii.  When Vesuvius erupts Part Two begins and players are trying to move their villagers out of Pompeii before the lava flow consumes them in flame.  The basic mechanic is safety in numbers: when placing one gets to place extra villagers if placed where others exist.  When moving players can move as far as the number of villagers on the space moved from.  UPDATE: bumped rating down a half point as there's just not enough real strategy and too much luck.  Rating would be much lower if it wasn't so quick with a great theme.

Every time we revisit this game, it just never disappoints.  I think it is one of those games that we will be able to play for years and years, and will just get better and better when the whole family can join in.

It is simple, unique, and tactical, with just the right amount of luck (in the draw) thrown in.  I don't usually like lucky games, but this one is over so quickly that you can jump right back in and try again.

* Theme nicely integrated: you place people in Pompeii, then rush to evacuate them
* Tense and chaotic, with ample player screwage (ie tossing opponents into Vesuvius)
* Nice mechanic shift from one game phase to the next (area control then tile-laying)
* Setup is a bit of a pain (but necessary to denote different game phases)
* Good for lighter gamers and press-your-luck fans
* Initial rating: [b]7/10[/b]

* Still holds good replay value, and plays quickly with those familiar with the rules
* Shift in mechanics (card play to tile placement) makes for a unique gameplay 
* Even after 25+ plays, doesn't show any signs of being ignored/traded
* Good experiences with both light gamers (parents) and heavy gamers alike

Quite little is based on tactical placement or movement, and a lot is based on luck - especially if your opponent(s) get all the Omen cards!

Still, it remains good fun and nice to see such a multi-phased game - I like that about it.

EDIT: Impression improved of this game. Easily playable in 20-30 minutes and for that time it's awesome fun with the kids with quite some strategy and take that too!

The actions you can take are limited by the cards you draw, and in the latter stage of the game the lava spreads based on which tiles are pulled out of the bag. It's about playing the odds based on which tiles are more likely to be pulled. The way your people flee the city at the end allows for interesting decisions, but ultimately it's a middling game.

A classic Euro that sees the players attempt to fill and flee the famed city of Pompeii before Vesuvius errupts and covers their people in molten death. 

A simple but elegant set of mechanics are used to first place meeple into the city and then move them out as they attempt to reach one of the city gates before it is too late.

Throwing your opponent's into the 3D volcano is one of the more satisfying and memorable things you can do in a Euro!

Wonderful little game where you place your citizens in the town of Pompei and then try to get them out after the volcano erupts and fills the city with lava.

Fun filler, nice components (except for the very fiddly carboard volcano).  Nice fast paced game, which is part strategy and part luck.

DoP is a good game for families. That's the very first thing I have to say as the game has just enough fun with the volcano mechanism a chief part of the game play. There is nothing like burning your opponents meeples to death to bring about some family fun and get the comments flowing around the table. :)

The biggest asset of this game is that once everyone knows the rules to the game it moves along as a very quick pace. Yes, there is some downtime as you wait for your turn to come around to make you moves but the decisions in this game aren't rocket science... place a meeple, pick a card... place a lava tile... move your meeples to safety... burn an opponent's family members once in a while... repeat often. The actions don't take that long to decide and it's fun to watch the board take shape and see meeples getting charcoaled in Vesuvius along the way.  

The game isn't overly complicated but like any good game... there is enough strategy to make you think about what areas to occupy and there is real tension in the "Run for your lives" stage where you are hoping your little pieces aren't burnt to a crisp by your evil opponents.

Overall a great little family game and a pretty solid gateway style game for non-gamers as well. There is just enough confrontation and the potential for some evil yet strategic moves combined with a decent theme that this game should be a pretty easy sell to a fairly broad range of gamers.

Interestingly different game with 2 players as opposed to 4.  Quick moving yet strategic.  Between card drawing and lava tile draws, the luck factor is a little higher than I'd like, but in two player especially, skill is still a solid component.

We have had a lot of fun with this game in both 2 and 3 player games.  Especially when the lava spews out of Vesuvius, taking out several people of Pompeji at once.

Suprisingly, the kids didn't mind getting their people thrown into the volcano as everyone at the table was feeling the stinging singe while getting tossed in with sound effects.

A clever game depicting the destruction of Pompeii.  The two phases of the game population and then destruction, are really well balanced.  Don't think that the population phase is just get as many pieces down.  You need to limit your opponents while trying to get the best positions.  The destruction phase is fun, placing lava tiles to pressure, block or destroy your opponents pieces is a whole lot of fun (especially if sound effects are thrown in).  

In our first game, I had the wonderful honour of toasting the first victims.  I placed the lava tile and grabbed those two suckers while making volcano and screaming sound effects.  There was deathly silence from my opponents.  I became concerned.  Was I too flippant about death? Was I showing no respect to those poor residents of Pompeji and the terrible pain they faced.  No. The silence was based on the fact that my opponents had no idea why I was toasting my own people.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Brilliant, brutal fun!
While essentially a simple and light filler, Der Untergang von Pompeji nevertheless requires some tactical thinking. Luck of the draw (in both cards and lava tiles) has a significant impact in the overall flow of the game, but a clever player can usually take advantage of any situation. Granted, our first game was, somewhat discouragingly, a complete and utter tie, but by the third game, my wife was able to sweep over a dozen of my people off the board with a single well-placed tile and secure a staggering win - mainly because I wasn't paying enough attention to the placement of my pieces.
Pompeji is a deceptively simple game with plenty of room for clever play. It might be just a bit too light and fast for me to ever be really good at, but I don't mind. I just like tossing people into a volcano.

RATING: 6.5
This is a light game based upon the small village of Pompeii that was wiped out during the eruption of Mt Vesuvius. Players first palce meeples into the buildings of Pompeii depending on the location cards they have. In the second phase of the game, players place lava tiles which may trap or engulf meeples. Player can move two of their own meeples per turn to get them out of the city and whoever has the most meeples out wins. 

There is a lot of luck in this game, but the geography of where the lava tiles start may favour one side where to initially place meeples. It's light, and can be fun in the right environment.

This was a fun game, very thematic. It moved a little slow at times since there were only 2 players and it seemed to take a while to get to the "Downfall" portion. 
Still, very fun to play.

More fun than I expected. The chaos of the random draws is somewhat balanced by the player choices of keeping the leaders in check, and blocking off an exit (or, better yet, sending a ball of hot lava death directly onto the space where multiple opponents sit) is awful fun! I recommend a "no-whining" rule before playing, and to let everyone know that some games are meant to be played for the sheer fun they offer. If anyone takes this too seriously, it could really become a painful experience.

The only aspect of this game I don't like is that sometimes there isn't enough pieces for each player to make it interesting. There is some prep time for the deck each game and then there can be an active volcano with something like 15 pieces on the board.

Another entertaining game where the resident whipping boy of the game group invariably gets ganged up on mercilessly. It's light and enjoyable, so has loads of non-gamer appeal. I got a rise out of the "people-coming-like-lemmings-to-see-the-volcano" mechanic, and the artwork was great too.

Quick, easy and very entertaining.  What this game lacks in depth it makes up for in speed of play.  Actual playtime runs about 20-30 minutes and is filled with the screams of those either being sacrificed to Vesuvius or failing to outrun the lava.  Okay, so the screams are simulated - but that just makes it all the better.
I would highly recommend this one as a great filler game or end of the evening game to anyone who can get their hands on it, and the fact that it's totally language independent makes it that much easier to grab one.

RATING: 7
The Downfall Of Pompeii is on par with its contemporary, Survive: Escape From Atlantis. Both have a similar concept and mechanics. Where Pompeii suffers by comparison is in the components; while not ugly by any means, they aren't as lovely as those in Survive. I do feel that Pompeii scores over Survive in that Pompeii is less likely to force the repeated victimization of a single opponent due to how the lava works compared to Survive's sea creatures.

One real downside I feel Pompeii has is that half the game is extended setup. That is not to say that it is boring, but you might have to field some questions of "So, when do we actually get to play this game?"

RATING: 7
I love that the back story for this game makes sense with the game play.  After the first volcano eruption people thought it was OK to start moving back into the city (1st part of the game).  This is when the players are trying to populate the city with as many pawns of their color as possible, after all the more you have in the city...the more you may be able to get OUT of the city.

The second part of the game is when the second volcanic eruption occurs and it is now time to evacuate the city again!  Everyone takes turns moving their pawns out of the city, whomever escapes with the most pawns intact, wins!

Very clever game with nice strategic elements, soaking in theme, and played in 30-45 minutes.

RATING: 4
Very slight game, reminded me of Survive! Escape from Atlantis but without the hidden scoring value element that makes that one so engaging. Throwing people in the volcano because of randomly-drawn omen cards was not a mechanic I enjoyed, especially having drawn most of them myself one after another and obliterating my opponents so early on. A die roll could bear similar odds but engender more of a sense of fairness. On the other hand, it seemed like a much more fair randomization to draw the volcano tiles later on.

Simple game, not sure how to categorize it. You use cards to place your people on the board, then must evacuate them in the best way possible later. A bit random since you have a small hand of cards to use to place your guys, and then the evacuation routes can change depending on how people flow the lava. Not much in the way of heavy strategy, since your options are somewhat limited.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.25
Great game, with 2 very different parts. Both first and second are very tense. It's not a highly strategic game, but there are definitly some strategic decisions and it's fun to play.

Drawbacks:
-> Omens are very luck dependant and they can make big differences. Also, if other players hit you hard, it's quite unlikely you will win.
-> Once you've played a couple of games, you know which are the good spots. The first phase is not as interesting as the second one.


Pros:
-> Plays very fast.
-> Games are very intense.

Is it a territory game?  A tile game? A race game?  It's all three.  Between this and Taluva I have decided that all games with volcanoes are great.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The game goes in two phases. First you populate the city of Pompej and then volcano erupts and you (try to) evacuate your people. The game goes in about 30-45 minutes. There is plenty of randomness (the cards, drawing lava tiles) and you are more likely to win if you begin phase 2 and/or get to draw most Omen cards. But the game is short and fun enough game so this doesn't bother as much.

I particularly like how the theme is on the evil side and you can make nasty moves for opponents but overall feel of the game is still much more fun than cutthroath. The game has a nice story arch for such a simple, short and pretty abstract game.

The game works well with 3 or 4. A little bit less control with 4 players but it almost fits the theme and the game is fun to play either way.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An odd, but fun little title about repopulating Pompeii after the earthquake that preceeded the great eruption, then get them the hell out once the volcano blows. Not for everyone, and the theme and the "relatives" mechanic might be too much for children below a certain age.

Uproarious and vindictive fun deriving from Finca-like mechanics, which were indeed what made that game so much fun.

RATING: 9
Enjoyable, light strategy game with a bit of luck thrown in.  Very thematic with beautiful components. Clever initial deck construction sets the pace for this game.  The first half of the game has an enjoyable meeple placement mechanism as you try to claim the property with those nice views of Pompeii's gates.  The second half of the game takes place as Mount Vesuvius erupts which turns the tension up as you try to get as many of your followers out of the city gates as you can. I can feel the panic of my meeples as they run from the lava.  UPDATE: Increased my initial rating of 8 to a 9 after some great 2-player games.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]This game lasted a year in our collection and we really enjoyed our 10 plays (in fact this is a game my dad played with us). I have to admit that after the last few plays we decided that we played the game out. Yes there is randomness in each game based on the card draw and tile selection/placement, but the game started to feel samey. We all new where the best spots on the board were and even throwing other players people into the volcano started to lose it's charm. All that said I would still recommend this game to other families, just go into knowing that it will likely have a limited number of plays in it for you but I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride.

I also need to admit that I may have been hasty getting rid of Survive: Escape from Atlantis! which received twice as many plays as Pompeii before I traded it. Looking back Survive definitely had a lot more variety in the way the game played out. I would consider getting another copy since it was a game that we played a lot with our extended family (especially once we got the 5/6 player expansion.)[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Fun! Everyone loves throwing meeples into the volcanoes and blocking other peoples paths to safety with a well placed lava tile.
- Another great family game; easy to teach with nice components (especially the volcano).
- My dad has had fun playing this with my kids. He enjoys games like this and Survive: Escape from Atlantis!.
- I like how the people placement works when you are able to place out "family" members if there are already people in a building.
- Love the tile placement for the lava flow after the volcano erupts (the opposite of Survive where you are removing tiles).[/i]

Dropping people in the volcano? Why yes how else can you take out your aggressions on your opponent. Actually, this is a great game that is medium weight, and a gateway type game. You strategically place your people in buildings for the fastest getaway for when the lava begins to engulf the city.

I was going to give this a 4, then I saw that munchikin quest was a 4, and I did not mean to insult this game that bad.  I think I may have liked this game, except for the fact that there is a rule which penalizes players for doing better in the first half of the game.  Since many players are likely to tie, the tie breaker will put the people who did worse early in the higher finishing spots.  Maybe I need to try again, but seriously, who penalizes someone for being better wtf.

RATING: 7
This has some nice things to recommend it, including the theme and the roasting of dudes in the volcano. It's a tale of halves - placing dudes out (where the luck of the cards plays a part), and from the mid-way point, running the dudes out of there. Players get a chance who to roast through the game, so most games will end up being fairly even with leader bashing taking place, with maybe the player who gets lucky in avoiding the early volcano tiles getting the key edge. But for a 20 minute filler type game, this is fine. The game plays quickly and generates good fun. It's even decent as a light 2 player, but the luck here might play more of a part as there's less people to hit on any leader which may emerge as a result of card luck.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A modern day classic. The first portion of the game uses card management to populate the city with your citizens. The last portion uses random tile draws to produce lava flows, and is about trying to get the most of your citizens out before it is too late.

I enjoy the 2 stage feature of the game. Kids and adults enjoy the plopping of their opponents citizen pieces into the volcano. I personally prefer this over Survive - Escape From Atlantis.

The Downfall of Pompeii is a light family game that can turn cutthroat in a hurry. The choices in the beginning are simple; you play a card that shows a type of building on which you can place one of your citizens. The real fun begins when the volcano erupts. Here you’ll draw a volcano tile out of the bag, and then move two of your pieces, hopefully hedging them closer to safety while attempting to block other players’ pieces from escaping a fiery death. Despite its dog-eat-dog nature, The Downfall of Pompeii remains accessible enough for casual players to jump into while offering an experience aimed to satisfy players of any skill level. After all, is there really anything more satisfying than throwing your opponents’ pieces into a volcano?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The game is divided into two parts, a "seeding" phase where you're putting your guys into buildings, and a running away phase where you're fleeing the lava.  The seeding phase isn't very interesting (not to mention completely random), but plowing people down with lava tiles and trying to run away is pretty fun.  The setup with stacking the deck and the whole seeding phase are probably too much work for such a light game, though.

Relatively quick playing and with separate phases that have their own distinctive character. That's gives Pompeii a fresh and brisk feel throughout the gametime.

Felt like a mix between Tikal and Carcassone, and I actually prefer Pompeii to those games. But although it's fun throwing your opponents townspeople into the vulcano, Pompeii is rather dry and dispite it's light rules it does have some tendensies to bring out AP in the players.

I love games where you can sacrifice your opponents into the 3-D volcano!  It's a good combo game, has some tile laying, and decently interactive.

When the volcano blows, run your pieces like h--- getting out before the other players drop lava on them.  Of course, in your turn, you can drop lava on your opponents and toss their pieces into the 3-D volcano that comes with the game.  Good fun, and one of the few boardgames my wife will play!

Cool game with theme dripping like hot magma.  (Or lava, whatever floats your boat.) Lots of luck involved (with the Omens and the tile draws).  Have only played once, so I'll need to play some more to see if my initial excitement holds up.  Have (finally) played more.  I like it best with 4 so far.  Pretty speedy game that reminds me more and more of Survive!, with luck mostly in the setup (though immense majorities of people in the city is by no means a guarantee of victory).  The race to flee the city is a bit more strategic than the setup and shows the pitfalls of putting too many people in the city in tough spaces.

In a 4-player game, I only had 16 people out there and managed to get 10 out, while two others with 21 and 22 respectively, only managed to get 7 and 9 out.  (I lost by 1 to the other player, who got 11 of 19 out.)  Fewer people therefore does not necessarily mean defeat.  This (somewhat anecdotal) fact and the game's fun-ness has me boost it to an 8.

This is a pretty light and easy to learn Euro style game. I really like the changing mechanics of the game. So far, I have yet to win a game (I play this online too). The volcano theme combined with the roman city theme work well, albeit it being a bit dark (burning other people pieces). It plays really quickly and I can see this being a great filler game for people that like euros. I would think a game with people that know the rules should last 30 to 45 minutes.

Simple, but interesting and rather unique game, combining card playing and tile laying. It has basically two phases. On the first, you are populating Pompeii with your tokens (and sometimes removing your opponents' ones) through the use of cards. When the "eruption card", comes out the second phase begins. Now you getting lava tiles from a bag (representing the progressive destruction of the city), placing them on the board in way that hampers your opponents while trying to get your people out of the city. Highly recommended for new players. My 6-year old loves it!

RATING: 4
I was disappointed with this one.  The game is split into two halves, the first half you place your people in the city using this boring card-driven system.  Then the volcano errupts and you got to get the people out the doors, the lava slowly moves around the city gobbling up the people.  I dunno, I think alot of people will quite enjoy this, but it got repetitive even though it was only 45 minutes in length.  The scores were real close in the end however which made for an exciting finish.  It says it's for 2 but I'd definitely play it with 3 or 4.

I own the German edition - don't be afraid to order it if you can't speak German. 95% language independant, after a round you get what's going on.

'Pompeji', as it has come to be known, is quickly becoming one of my most prized games, and these are the reasons why:  Pompeji is easy to learn but difficult to master; the game plays quick and repeat games are feasible; the scalable, overlying strategy is easily grasped by kids, non-gamers, and tacticians alike; the game has two very different rounds; the game is ripe with theme.  Really, this is a game that I will recommend to everyone, and I feel lucky to have my copy.  However, hardcore gamers beware.. if you're looking for something that you can take seriously, this isn't it.. but for a night of gaming, it's a great one to put on the agenda.

When do I play this?:
Whenever I can.  I don't know how people can't like this game... well ... maybe I can, but I wouldn't want to associate myself with them. :D

Utterly random game. Sure, it's light, family-friendly, has a funny(?) theme, and the joy(?) of throwing people in a cardboard volcano, but the rules make very little sense, it's draw-and-place (which offers only a little more choice than roll-and-move), and the randomness is only offset by a huge screw-you factor, meaning that if the random draw doesn't screw you, the other players will. That's not how you balance a game. I find it pointless and frustrating, but I guess that if you really, really just want to throw people in a volcano, this is the game for you.

RATING: 6
Update: Surprisingly, plays on Yucata are enjoyable because the theme still shines through the mechanics and visuals. Still it is anticlimactic, now fired by Flashpoint, though maybe interested in Great Fire of London for a more historical feel.

Unfortunately, despite the strong theme, so far (3 games in) there is no smoke to mask who will win the game, which leaves the game anitclimatic. The first phase is interesting as you try and set yourself up to increase your population with the relatives rule, though the omen cards can unbalance placements. Just when you think you can get your folks in, the volcano blows aaah. Then we're into the 2nd phase which has mechanics conducive to downtime:- draw tile and move 2 guys. Unfortunately, I've seen situations where players have group their people which then gives godspeed to another player's occupying piece. Provokes sooty black humour as you toss victims into the mouth of the volcano(and we've never needed to look in for tie breaks), but ultimately doesn't light my fire.

This is a very quick game where the first half you populate the city with your pawns, and the second half you draw volcano tiles from the bag and try to murder your opponents guys while getting your own guys out safely. Quick, and fun. A bit random, since placement relies a lot of card draws in stage 1 and tile draws on stage 2. Still, the theme helps this game hold up as it's inherently fun to burn the place down.

A simple quick game. Has 2 primary phases. 
Using a card draw place pieces on the board. Having precognition, your placement is with an eye for a quick exit.
The next phase - lava tiles come out destroying all in place. Your pieces need to head for the gates. The number of pieces in the location determine how far you can move, so it is best to leave your neighbors to their fiery fate.

Sound effects as citizens encounter the volcano, as are comments on hot tubs or hot footing it are a must.

Great game.  Fits the theme (though not as brutal as the real thing probably was).  Quick, too (2-player, less than 35 minutes).  After another 2-player game, I'll say it must be much better with 4 players.  With two, you have too much control over the lava flows and too many people are saved.  Second game took 40 minutes.  Update: having now played with 4 players, I must say I liked it a lot that way.  With just two, it's very calculating, but with three people taking a turn before your next chance, you can't just play the odds always.  Plus, I won even though I had fewer pieces on the board when the volcano blew. :)

Played this game with my girlfriend when she purchased it. Great game with lots of collaboration and sabotaging during gameplay! Only gripe I have about Pompeii is the complexity of the setup phase which is very lengthy and usually deters me from wanting to go another round.

19/12/2007: Rating updated from 6.25 to 8.5. Played 2 rounds today, and greatly enjoyed it. There is room for strategic planning in this short and quick game. Setup is faster, now that I have gotten the hang of the deck preparation.

Not as good as I though it might turn out to be. The basic idea is great and the asymmetrical game design is pretty neat, but I still found that there was never much strategy to my decision. On the other hand, maybe that is why I did not win and I should play again to see if the strategy is not hidden under some rocks ? A good game, but not fantastic. I will have to play it again and the rating can go either way.

A game that is easy to under-rate, as the first English translation got the set-up rules completely wrong (turning people off the game when it first came out), and even with the right rules it seems devoid of any real decisions.

Not so - your placement in the first half of the game has a big impact on the second, and there's a lot of risk analysis and mitigation that can be done to make sure that you score as well as you can.

It's no heavyweight gamers' game, but it IS a good family-weight game - probably the best of 2004 (though I am also partial to 80 Days).  I find that I enjoy it far more than the author's Carcassonne!

Un gioco dalla doppia meccanica completamente differente e semplice, non banalissima, e dalla grafica molto bella. Un legame (cosa insolita) ben strutturato con l'ambientazione, che si sente molto, una piccola perla non molto conosciuta. Nel complesso il gioco è ben riuscito. La fortuna ha il suo peso, ma per vincere serve soprattutto una buona strategia. Una partita non dura parecchio e il ritmo di gioco resta sempre su livelli più che accettabili; in più, è possibile attaccare spudoratamente gli altri giocatori bruciando le loro pedine nel vulcano, un perverso piacere, così come è doveroso cercare di convincerli a risparmiare le nostre! Molta interazione e una buona dose di tensione rendono il gioco molto molto accattivante. Una bella sorpresa!

Slightly barbaric but immensely enjoyable to throw your opponents into the volcano! A clever game of stages: try to put put your people strategically into the city, get a warning from the volcano & carry on with the addition of relatives to maximise your pieces on the board (plus sacrificing the odd opponent piece to the rumbling volcano!), then run like crazy when she erupts whilst trying to smother your opponents pieces in lava! Loving it! - works well for just 2 players ... better with more.

It's often hard to convince my game group to play confrontational games, but everyone seemed to enjoy tossing eachother's pieces into the volcano. The game is light and fast enough to relieve a lot of the tension that usually comes with the types of games. The first phase of the game seems to drag a little bit, since piece placement isn't terribly important when the volcano tiles are random. The fun is definitely in the eruption/escape phase.

As enjoyable as this is, I think I prefer Survive: Escape from Atlantis over Pompeii when it comes to out-fleeing natural disasters in my board games.

After one play: could be fun for the right people. But the rules (which change a few times as the game progresses) are a bit complex for kids, yet the game feels too light for adults. For my own taste I found it to be too lightweight, too random, and perhaps too mean-spirited; but then I don't enjoy "take that!" games. There is ample opportunity to be mean to your opponents by throwing their people into the volcano.

Simple game in which you first place wooden counters into the city and then attempt to escape once the lava starts to flow. The strategies are fairly simple - get as many people in and get as many out as possible. The draw of cards and placement of lava are not huge luck factors but the interaction with the other players is mostly beyond your control and the game certainly doesn't have a lot of tactical depth. However it is easy to play and a lot of fun.

An interesting, two-stage game. In stage one, you place your Romans around the city of Pompeii using a deck of cards. In the deck of cards are two "AD 79" cards. Once the second one hits the table, the volcano explodes and stage two begins. In stage two you move your Romans out of the city, and draw lava tiles to place on the board killing Romans and blocking them off from exiting the city. 

It is a fun game that plays best with 4 players.

Seems like a light, fun game with the fantastic theme of throwing people into lava to win the game. It's totally worth having for that reason alone. And it might actually be a good game to introduce a newer player to the boardgaming hobby.

After a second play, it seems that throwing people in lava doesn't rescue a relatively weak game. There is better fare for new entrants to the hobby. In particular, setting the deck between plays and explaining three different sets of rules for three different mini-games (phases of the game) speaks against its usability as a gateway game.

For a regular game, it's too light, and although you can come up with a few "neat" ways to help your people escape, it's not very challenging.

Seemingly too-long rules for a pretty simple fun eurogame that was enjoyable to play.  (And calling your extra people "relatives" was just plain confusing.)

In the first half, players put their dudes into buildings.  In the second half, lava starts flowing and dudes flee to escape the city.  The lava flow is a clever combination of randomness and player controlled mayhem to cover or surround other players' dudes.  Good fun (even if the theme is rather morbid if you think about it), especially when you get to throw someone's dude into the paper cone volcano.

Nice game where youhave to first get as many pieces on board (in the city of Pompeji) as possible and then when the volcano starts to erupt you have to get as many of them as possible out of the city. A good family game which in this case is not a bad thing.

The best part about this game is throwing other players meeples into the volcano after destroying them in a lava flow.  The game is light and quick playing.  One thing I like about it is that if you try to play your own game without working with other players, at least initially, you will lose.  Put your people with other players and it is less likely that those players will actively work to destroy that area.  Then, when the opportunity presents itself, run out of the city and leave your "friends" behind.

This is a very easy but funny game which is played in two phases that really feel different. Phase one maybe is based on a bit of luck but phase two solves that in a brilliant matter.

Not too shabby. Strangely, the cardplay is more exciting than the lava-melting bit. Enjoying this more the more I play it, and it's equally good as a kids or grownups game.

This is a very silly game which is extremely enjoyable. As I always get picked on, my rating has slid a little. No game collection could possibly be complete without it, a big hit with neophyte gamers - who can resist the joy of dropping coloured cubes into the hungry maw of Vesuvius?

After several plays I've decided there's too much luck with the card and then tile draw to make this satisfying whether you win or lose. After setup one player might have 18 people on the board and another only 10. Crazy imbalance. Plays much better with three than four - less random.  Easy rules. Quick at less than 30 minutes. A wasted 30 minutes as far as I'm concerned. Not for me thanks.

I can tell this is from the designer of Carc, because it feels a little similar in some respects. I like the two halves concept of the game, where you're populating the town and then having them race to get out. A little light, but some nice decision points.

the plastic volcano that you sacrifice meeples into is totally fun. running away from the lava is pretty amusing too.

Two! Two! Two games in one!  The initial phase placing your meeples is reasonably engaging, but the real fun starts when the lava gets aflowin'.  The little things count big, like the 3D volcano cone thoughtfully included in the game.  And that lava is so smart, always cutting off the exits!  A good time.

A lot of fun but not the deepest game strategically. I felt like I understood the best ways to play by the end of my second game. The jury is still out for me on the theme: is it right to enjoy playing a game that is based on a catastrophic event that killed 16,000 people? It helps me to think of the pieces as robots or something. Overall, The Downfall of Pompeii is quick, exciting, and an enjoyably stressful game.

A cool and different theme that kind of makes me think of the old Survive.  You start by trying to populate Pompeii and then running for your lives to get out before the lava destroys the city.  I enjoyed it, but I can see it getting old quick.  The biggest knock that I can see is all of the card setup.

The more I play this, the less I like it.  It's pretty much an exercise in randomness.  The tiles are random, the cards are random, the omens are random.  Too much randomness and not enough fun.

What could be more fun than tossing your friends' pieces into a volcano.  It helps that there is actually an interesting game attached to that.  I like the two stage play of the game, though for me, fleeing the city is by far the more interesting phase.  I may have to actually pick this one up someday.  [01/08/2011]

RATING: 6
Having only played this a couple times (once with 2, and once with 4), I'm not impressed.  The theme is fun, and I do like how the game breaks into 2 Acts:  first, distribute citizens to the various buildings and second, try to get them out before the lava kills them.  

However, the rules are unnecessarily difficult and unintuitive for such a simple game and there's too much luck for me to find this an interesting strategic exercise.  Overall, a blah game - even just as a casual, family experience.  Looking to trade.

Update:  traded for London in September, 2013
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great family game that works well with the theme - very satisfying throwing people (wooden cyliders) into the volcano. Setup and phasing is a bit odd for a family game but one game makes it all clear to anyone and it plays very well. Luck in the tile draw and omen cards make this not seriously strategic but that is the way it should be as this can be played quickly (30 minutes) for fun.

The Downfall of Pompeii -- played once; four-player.  More strategy than one might assume, and quite enjoyable, but still the luck dilutes satisfaction.

This is by Wrede, designer of Carcassonne. The game is divided into two parts. We didn't know how the second part worked until we started it, so we had no idea what or why we were doing in the first part, sort of like the first time playing Dvonn. In the first part you put your people in the town. In the second you move them out as the lava flows.

While similar in theme and some ideas to the other Pompeii game I played (Last 37 Minutes, which I didn't like), this one offers you more control. I suspect that now that I know what I'm doing, the game will make some sense the next few times I try it. On the other hand, it also looks like the game is rather limited in depth and won't withstand more than ten or so plays, altogether. I will have to play it more times to confirm this.

I was so happy to realize recently that 'Pompeii' on Yucata is the same thing as Downfall of Pompeii! I had only played this game once, despite owning it and was interested in playing more. The choices in this game are not too difficult- it's a light weight Euro. But it's fun and engaging and when you play in real life, you get to throw people into a volcano.

Split into 2 portions: players spend the first half seeding the board (yawn) and when Pompei erupts, players move play lava tiles and move their pieces out of the doomed city.

The game feels forced fit into the German mold: the escape phase is tense and full of choices and hosage. The seeding phase feels nominal and there isn't really much to it.

Goes down well with newbies. Nice looking bits.

The volcano is made of a sturdy plastic material with a significant amount of spring in it. At one point in the game a player put her fingers against the edge of the volcano as she was dropping a piece in. The Volcano came unhinged and immediately cleared off half the board as it flung itself outwards. Sigh... now I have made notches in the volcano so that it hooks into itself. Works like a charm. This game is quite random and it is easy to hand the victory to other players. For the right crowd it can be a lot of fun.

The Downfall of Pompeii is an entertaining social entry into the gaming field. It's very light, and chance plays a tremendous role despite the appearance of self-determination. Around a table of roughly equal players, the winner will be determined largely by chance and by who chooses to victimize whom when the Omen cards are drawn. If you try to play this game competitively and strategically, you are in for a major let down. So don't. Instead, just kick back, throw screaming meeples hex-cylinders into the volcano, and have some fun. It's a relaxing social game which doesn't make you think too hard, and plays very quick. In other words, Downfall is a great filler. Personally, I don't want to play fillers that often, so no matter how excellently they are designed I can't get all that jazzed about playing them. I just really groove on mental stimulation - but this game is a perfect breath of fresh air if you need a break from intensity. It is also an excellent game to play with kids, as your masterplans can be easily foiled, thus allowing a little bit of youth victory to occur now and then. So it's much better as a family game than many Euros.

Sok jót hallottam már róla, de nem gondoltam, hogy ennyire jó kis játék lesz ez a 2004-ben kiadott társas. Embereinket telepítjük Pompejibe, ami mellett nemsokára kitör a vulkán és menekülnünk kell. Érdekes téma nagyon jó megvalósítással. Több fázisban kerülnek fel az embereink Pompeji házaiba, majd a vulkánkitörés után menekülünk és tereljük a lávát az ellenfelek emberei felé a mieinktől minél távolabb. Meglepő módon a két eddig játszott parti nagyon kiegyenlített lett, pedig a szerencse szerepét nem kicsinek érzem több helyen sem a játékban. Nagyon konfliktusos játék, azonban ha a játékosok nem személy okokból vezérelve indulnak el egymás ellen, akkor tényleg nagyon izgalmas játék sülhet ki a Pompeji bukásából. Nagyon tematikus, jól adja vissza a szörnyű esemény izgalmát a játék. Nagyon gyors, második játékra már simán lemehet 1 óra alatt és nagyon változatos minden parti. Mindenképp ajánlott a játék azoknak, akik nem félnek némi konfliktustól.

I have to love any game where you get to scream "Your ass got Magma'ed!"  If you like moving pieces around on a board running from hot lava, this game is for you.  Many fun choices trying to work against the player controlled AI of the the lava flow.  

People complain about the set up phase, but I see no problems in it.  I think it rather fun and relaxing, getting you ready for the big blow.  A strong playing in the first phase will help you quite a bit in the second (which seems more than reasonable to me).  There is more to the first phase than just setting your guys up by the exits.  Regardless, it is a lot of random and a touch chaotic, but for me once you accept it there is a joy in running your pieces around the city.  

This is the kind of game that Milton Bradley needs to be making.  If you love Survive!, this should be as much of a pleasure.

Overall it is grand fun, but I do have to say that there is the potential of A/P.  Nothing too serious, but it is there.

Downfall of Pompeii is a pretty good light time.  I feel like the theme of the game is incorporated very well, with the 3D volcano, and the lava flow mechanisms.  I think that I like this one more because a player can do poorly in the first-half(read: few units placed on the board) but still do well in the second-half by efficiently evacuating.

I was surprised how fun this quick game was. I didn't expect it to be so enjoyable... I thought for some reason it would be a brain burner, but not at all. Our entire group really liked the double mechanics and how the game is split into two phases. We had a little trouble discerning what a double building was, as the map art is a tad ambiguous, but once we decided it went smoothly. Love throwing meeples into the volcano!

A family favorite.  Combines area control with tile-laying, two of my personal stalwarts!  Also, this is a terrific entry-level strategy game for youngsters, but definitely enough there for adults who like the light-strategy genre.

It plays in two phases, first you place your people into the city of Pompeji, then the lava starts to flow an you try to get them out. I think this is what makes the game so good, it's about clever placement, area control and frantic escape from the disaster outbreak, all three aspects blend and work well. It is fun to through your opponent into the volcano after all! It doesn't play too long which is nice, too. Mostly played with 2 but had a couple of 3 player games. I think I prefer 2 but more players don't have a downside, it is just personal taste.

Copycat purchase.  many plays before joining bgg.  another game that hooked us into the gaming hobby.  cards and tiles and wood bits, whats not to like? definitely a lot of randomness with cards, omen cards, and tiles.  however, i think it fits with this theme and i really like making the tactical decisions that come up with the cards or tiles, where to place family or who you sacrifice to save others.  and the volcano, the signature piece of the game.  who doesn't love sacrificing a meeple to the gods and screaming as they plummet to a firery death.  pros:  incorporates cards and tiles, quick gaming times, take that   cons:  take that, maybe too random for some (not me though)

Nice family game, with major screwage potential (is that a contradiction?). The first fase is a bit tame, though. The game only comes to life after Vesuvius erupts.

RATING: 7.5
A light strategy game that is good family fun. There is a significant luck element, but planning and solid tactical play will result in the better players coming out on top more often than not. For some reason, throwing another player's people in the volcano generates less ill feeling than similar actions in other games.

I finally own this game!  It's been on my radar for ages, at last I had the opportunity to play it, and I was still surprised by how much I enjoyed it!  It takes 2 distinct phases, combines a few very interesting mechanics, and adds just the right amount of luck and strategy to create a very fun and slightly brain-burning little game (perhaps caused by all the lava).  And speaking of lava, you get to throw your opponents' people into a volcano!  (Other Euro-styled games ought to take note of this!)  Besides the volcano, the game components are quite basic (although I've ordered 140 meeples to replace the people tokens), but you don't really notice the lack of production value because you are having so much fun!  I've used a lot of exclamation marks in this mini review!  That alone should indicate my enthusiasm with this game!  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 4/5  Total: 8.5/10

RATING: 6
Amusing multi-stage family game where pawns are placed in buildings in Pompeii and then must escape it in the face of oncoming lava. The final stage, where pawns can move as many spaces as the number of pawns in their starting space, is a particularly engaging exercise in shared incentives. Staying close to other players discourages them from placing lava nearby, but may enable them to run further (leaving you behind!) or simply present a richer target for other opponents. Throwing poor dead citizens into the volcano is a particularly nice touch. 

Ultimately there is far too much luck for my taste but I would be most intrigued in a variant with neither cards nor random tiles.

Really great family fun somewhat let down by a "cheap" feel to the game. The cardstock is thin, the playing pieces too generic, the board artwork merely suffices. I will be upgrading the parts.

The first half of the game is very much dictated by the luck of the card flow.
The second half of the game, however, is a quite interesting tactical problem, which actually gains from having more than 2 players at the table.

RATING: 5
A fun game reminiscent of the Parker Brothers classic, Survive! You spend the first half of the game placing your people in an area where you KNOW a volcanic eruption is imminent. How nice. The second half of the game is pure Survive! Get yer critters out of dodge while throwing your opponents' critters under the bus, er, lava.
Like I said, fun game, but I would have liked if the first half was a little more elegant. The setup is a bit tedious and the rules for placing "relatives" could have been a lot cleaner. I'm also slightly (ever so slightly) worried that it could have severe kingmaking issues. To be fair, Survive! also has these issues, but to a much lower degree because the values of the critters are unknown. Pompeii has much more open information. If Wolfgang Kramer had designed this, it could have been an all-time classic.

There's a bit of light strategy to this enjoyable game.  We've been playing it several times a week and get a kick seeing the populace form queues to leave the city.  We play a cut-throat game, but so far it's only been with two.  We'll soon be able to try it with four players.  The quality of the components isn't what we'd like, and I've ordered Mayday sleeves hoping they'll strengthen the cards, which are too thin.  We don't find the set up too fiddly, and we understand that it has to be this way in order to have the separate phases randomized as best as possible.  As I write this the game is set up on the dinette table, ready for another session.  Other than a minor gripe about quality, the rules are good and the game is fun.

Really fun throwing meeples into a volcano.

My group either likes direct confrontation (where the goal is to solely destroy the opponent) or multiplayer solitaire. They tend not to enjoy/have their feelings "hurt" if there is a screwage factor. In this game, the goal is to rescue as many of your people as possible. However, the fact that you can kill your opponent's people does not sit well with everyone.

An interesting idea where the volcano doesn't actually get used as much as expected.

A nicely vindictive little escape game in the same vein as Escape from Atlantis.

Update: The last 2 times I've played this, the winning score has been greater than the number of pieces one player has had on the board at the start of stage 2. One instance was through some fairly vicious Omen usage, the other was through lousy card draws and so no chances to invite 'relatives'. These are major issues in the game. 

Rating down from 6.9 to 5.

This whole game is mostly waiting for someone to set you up. In one phase it takes the form of "he put the third guy in that building on his turn so now I can put a guy there and then place 3 more guys on the board". In the next phase it becomes "he moved a third guy to this location on his turn so now I can run my guy 3 squares".

Just plain fun!

Basically like a "Survive" type game. There's lots of bashing the other players, but that's all random for the most part. The setup of the game (the first half) takes far too long for the payoff. There is little control at the end as the random lava comes out. Ok family game, but not a great gamer's game.

New. (trade for MTG)

Can you make a game that involves a group of people that all die in a natural disaster and enjoy dropping opponents in a volcano? The Downfall of Pompeii!!!

Game is played in two-stages.

Stage 1: Players load up Pompeii with as many of their clan as possible and as close to exits as possible. I guess those people knew that they might need an escape from Pompeii. Draw an omen and you get to pick a Joe to put......IN-THE-VOLCANO!!!! Loading your "family" is a little wonky.

Stage B: This is the fun part. The volcano erupts any you take turns putting lava on your opponents and select the two people in your family worth saving...this turn. If your block-eeple is around more block-eeples they can move faster. Again a little Timey-Whimey. 

Even thought theme has a few weird plot issues, it is a blast to play.

See what I did there?

RATING: 7
This is compared to Survive a lot, but I think Pompeii is a better version of this mechanic--maybe just because you get to throw people in a volcano, which is somewhat more satisfying than merely feeding them to sea monsters. Pompeii is played in two stages and therefore feels almost like two different games. The first part is intricate and a little dull compared to the last part; it's all about placement. When the volcano blows, it's a free-for-all to get out of the city while destroying your opponents when the lava flow. So it's flawed, but a lot of fun.

Quick, easy, fun and a great fusion of theme and gameplay. Only one real quibble ... the omen cards add seemingly unnecessary randomness, introduce a kingmaking element to the game and are even a bit unbalancing if one play happens to nab most of them (which is pure luck). Otherwise, this is a fun, simple romp through the lava-filled streets of Pompeii. For what it's worth, this is the 1,000 game I've rated and commended on here on BGG.

Sold June 2011. Plan to replace with Survive or Eruption.

Would like to see appropriately sized meeples so they can be tossed in the volcano.

Game is a little dry. Probably change it a little like start with the family rule in place so there are more people placed and less about the rules interruptions. Maybe even something like play 2 turns in a row, just to get the first part to move along more. 

Or play just go wherever you want, using family rule, and when first player to place them all goes, you finish that round. maybe also deal out omen cards, and you can use them instead of placing.

RATING: 7.5
Great theme, fiddly set up with the deck of cards (not too bad though). Plays in 3 basic phases of placing Pompeeples in the city of Pompei, then placing Pompeeles and their relatives and finally evacuating the city as Vesuvius erupts. Lots of fun throwing the Pompeeples in the cardboard volcano. Accessible to newbies. Scales well from 2 to 4 players, but the luck factor increases as you increase the number of players. I need to explore getting another color of Pompeeples to support a 5th player.

RATING: 6
Pompeii lends gamer credibility to the disaster game genre.  The rules are oddly a bit difficult to explain but gameplay is simple.  Plucking habitants and dropping them into the volcano and spreading lava tiles are both fun and visceral, oddly bordering on disturbing!  The final act overstays its welcome by a handful of turns.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Frantic and fun, but only play it with 4. A nice sense of foreboding as you occupy the city, and a great chaotic rush as you dodge lava and head for the hills. Don't take this one too seriously and you'll get a good laugh with your friends.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Quick and easy game, quite luck based. Setup (shuffling) more complicated than necessary, but still OK. 
First half of game: Place people on board (wooden cylinders), cards determine where you may place them. If you get a good placement, you get additional people in. Second half of game: Draw lava tiles and place them, then move your people out of the city. Movement points depend on number of people on the same area. This part is mostly push-your-luck: Which people to rescue immediately, which to give up. Recommended as gateway, but also enjoyed by frequent players.

RATING: 5.5
This is a pretty light game that most non-gamers will enjoy and agree to play again. There is very minimal stradegy involved in the game. The game is played quick and taught in just a few minutes. The game plays in two phases. First phase placing all your people on the map. Second phase getting your people to escape when the volcano errupts. The erruption happens randomly, and several times when I have played the volcano errupts before you can get a decent amount of people on the board. When the volcano errupts to soon it can really ruin the game. You might want to modify the rules a bit in order to make the volcano errupt later in the game.

Similar to Survive!, yet less chance driven.  I would say that I enjoy both games equally, and would play either of them any time.  

Pompeii does have a fairly high level of strategy (well, OK, mid level), and a high fun factor.  The bits are very well done, though it is annoying that if you want to play blue, you have to play four players, if you want to play yellow, you have to play 3 players (not enough of either color to use them in a 2p game).

Survive vs Pompeii:  Give me Survive any day.

I think the pacing of this is nice.  You have the setup that builds some anticipation of the imminent doom.  It also allows for some trash-talking.

Then, BOOM!  Vesuvius erupts, everybody scrambles and all of those clever family placements that you were trash-talking about turn out to be disatrous.  Great fun.

I like the two distinct parts and it makes the game more engaging for it.

I have introduced this to a number of people of different ages and they have all enjoyed it.  

This is definitely better the second time as the setup phase makes more sense.

I would like to see how well this plays with 5 or 6 and I own Tikal so I can swipe orange and natural colors from it, but I haven't done so.  I always chicken out because I think it will make the game too chaotic.

I agree with everybody that there should have been meeples, not barrels to represent families. 

A fun game.

Update: More plays, more fun. The rating has moved from a 7.5 to an 8. One of the problems with having a large game collection is that some games just don't get as much play as they should.

Throwing an opponent into the volcano - what could be more fun!  This race game is a blast (no pun intended), with two very distinct phases.  I really like the "relative" rule during placement and the movement mechanic as you race to get out.  The tension as the lava nears is palpable.  Great game that my whole family enjoys!

UPDATE: My love for the game has faded a bit with repeated plays, as it feels samey after a while - vying for the same spaces and trying for the same exit routes each game.  Still great for new players and popular with fans of "take that" games.

I don't understand why this isn't the top of every introductory/gateway game recommendation list.  Great lightweight game with lots of tension, fun, and enough decisions to keep it interesting.  Always a hilarously good time.  Has more strategy than you might think because it's subtle -- not "get your meeple to spots x, y, and z," but rather getting an overall board feel and look to spread out, team up so you're not a target, have access to multiple exits, etc.

I like the speed of this game, it's a pretty quick little game.  Will have to play it more to get some strategies firmed up in my mind but it's pretty fun. 

I'll be the first to admit that with 2 colors this is a dull 2 player game. So if each players play 2 colors and lowest of your scores is your score then the game shines. As you have to take care to do the best you can for each color it means you can't just ditch one player to get a high score for the other.

Holy crap, this is so much fun and plays quickly. If you're not making little screaming noises as you throwing Pompeii's citizens into the volcano, you're missing out on the fun of gaming.

This was surprisingly light with not very much control and not particularly difficult decisions, although it was still a rather fun and quick game.  It's not a game that I feel I need to add to my collection now, but I'd be happy to play it again, especially as a gateway game to introduce to new gamers.  I do like the mechanic of splitting the game into two phases (reminiscent of Fjords, among others) but the game is still pretty simplistic since it's basically just play a card in the first phase and play a tile in the second phase (although prioritizing which pieces to move out first is an interesting/difficult decision reminiscent of the difficult early decisions in Through the Desert or Hey That's My Fish).

RATING: 7.5
[thing=13004][/thing] is a simple, interactive and fun game: the goal is to save as many people from the fury of the volcano as possible. 

There are three phases in the game: in the first, only one people at a time is placed, accordingly with a card used (each player has a number of them in hand, and each has a number correlated with places on the board). In the second phase, people are added faster, as extra markers are put for each other people already in the same place a player adds her own. Finally, in the third phase, the volcano detonates and starts to kill people - no more markers are put, and players, now, try move the ones they have out of the city, as volcano tiles are constantly placed, killing and/or blocking the people and putting pressure in the players. Killed people goes into the volcano, and serve as a tie breaker at the end of the game. The person that saves the most people, will be the winner.

[thing=13004][/thing] has two parts with loads of luck built in - the draw of cards and of volcano tiles. Still, is normally more important to recognize and seize opportunities and they appear, both for the placement of people and with the timming of moving them - as the rule of movement is pretty clever and gives importance to planning wisely the placement of people: when a marker is moved, it can move a number of squares equal to the total number of markers in the spot it started. Simple and efficient in creating tension, interaction and in requering a sharp eye to seek the best opportunities, be for gain more movement, be to reduce the movement of others.

There are, however, two problems with [thing=13004][/thing]: the first I already mentioned, which is the luck factor. It is present in the draw of cards, that can put a serious limitation in what places you can add people, both in phases one and two; and there are also the Omen cards, that let you kill one people of other player - just like that. Also, the draw of volcano tiles can harm or help a lot one or more players. Nonetheless, [thing=13004][/thing] doens't present itself as heavily strategic, nor with great control or perfect information. It is a light game, with direct attacks, and fun due to all the destruction, running and tossing with satisfaction markers inside the volcano. Thus the random elements serve to increase the replay value, as new paths to place and flee must be taken in each play.

In the end, [thing=13004][/thing] pleased me a great deal, with its uncompromised nature, giving entertainment coupled with tatical decisions in search of windows of opportunity to overcame the others. It isn't perfect, nor will work for everyone, due to luck elements and agressive interaction. For me it worked in allowing some easy, quick paced and effective fun. Recommended.

This game is a unique, 2-phase game about Vesuvius wiping out the city of Pompeii. There is a very even blend of luck and strategy. This game has the ability to bring good post-game disussions. With the right group, it can be a game of giddy enjoyment as you anticipate various points of calamity throughout the game. This is a wonderful design by Klaus-Jurgen Wrede.

Since introducing this to my gaming group, two other people have bought it. This game has one of the best integration of themes and mechanics I've ever seen. Almost as theme-rich as Plunder, but much simpler in terms of rules. Such a great design.

A game based on the tragedy that befell Pompeii. The start of the game sees you moving your families into the city. The second half you are fleeing from the lava and attempting to trap and engulf your opponents' people. 

Gameplay is relatively light - but there's a tactical layer here which rewards attention and cunning.

The year is 79 A.D. Pompeii, sitting at the foot of Vesuvius, is at the high point in its development. People come to the city from far and wide to try and make their luck in the city. So far nobody has dreamed of the danger that will bury all of their dreams under mountains of ash not ten years later. Who will survive the eruption of Vesuvius unscathed?

Yes, the set up is random, the omen cards are random, and the lava tiles are random.  But if you can get past that, it's a fun cutthroat game.  My wife and I play this as a two player over Survive.  I wouldn't say it's a better game, just suited better for 2 players then Survive in my opinion.

Chucking my wife into the volcano is always fun!

Scads of vindictive fun.  Lots to think about in the placement half, especially once you can sneak your relatives into the city.  But once Vesuvius erupts, it's pretty mindless carnage.

I've only played once.  This game has two stages.  You first populate the city with people trying to set yourself up for the most successful escape.  Then the volcano erupts and you spend the rest of your game helping your people try to escape the lava while trying to place the lava in the way/on top of your opponents people.  A little sadistic fun.

Don't let looks deceive you - this game is quite a bit more thrilling and devious than you would expect judging it by its looks (the slightly boring looking cards and board)! Perfectly playable with two, in which case your first game should take around 60 minutes. The game is easy to explain and moves along at a brisk pace. Will you save the lone villager who has almost been surrounded by lava, or will you move the community to safety first? Good stuff!
UPDATE: Only played with two players sofar. I expect that the game will be better with three, possibly worse with four (too much chaos). Each of our games invoked a pleasant feeling of urgency, but because of the randomness involved in citizen and lava placement, every now and than we play a pretty unbalanced game. Still one of my favorite two player games however.

I really like the theme. It is different and quite funny in a way. I definitely liked the idea of bringing in people and then roasting them in the end for not moving fast enough. Only online play thus far but with two players, the game certainly does not move as fast, still need a couple more plays.

070211-Finally have a copy of the physical game. Played two players. The tension just wasn't there. It was light and fluffy, but the initial placement of figures appear to be quite random. The Omen cards did not help even out the randomness. I got one card while my opponent had 4. I also feel that the West side of the city is a little bit more forgiving. I definitely enjoyed the second part of the game a little more with the movement of the meeples, but for now, the first part of the game was quite a let down. Still, if the game is taken as a light party game, it is not terrible. This is strictly speaking from a gamer's perspective.

I found this game somewhat disappointing. It takes about an hour, making it too long for a filler, but there wasn't enough strategy in the placement phase, which is half of the game. This would be fine with me if lots of people died in the second half of the game, allowing for a fun, lightweight game with high screwage (similar to Galaxy Trucker). However, not that many people are trapped in the city, in my experience, making it neither fun enough or strategic enough for my tastes. If it lasted 30 minutes or was a really fun game, it would be okay, but as it stands, there are many middleweight Euros I'd play over this.

This game is very similar to Survive: Escape from Atlantis. First, everyone places meeples, and then a natural disaster happens leading to the hopeful rescue of those meeples. It's low on strategy (although there are some tactical decisions/movements to be made), but still a good bit of quick fun.

I never feel like the outcome of the game has much to do with skillful play.  There is enough randomness built into the system that as long as no one plays really poorly,  the outcome is largely determined by the tile draws.  That being said, I've enjoyed every game that I've played; it's undeniably great fun to throw your buddies dudes into the volcano.  Ahhhhh!

I'm a sucker for Ancient Pompeii in the first place, but this is a really fun game.  A little luck dependent with the cards & tiles drawn, but you can mitigate your luck as the game goes along.  I like strategizing how best to spread out my people within the city...and when Vesuvius blows it's top, Watch OUT for the lava flows!!! The race is on to get your guys to safety!  

How can you NOT love a game where you get to toss your opponent's people into a volcano!  Quick play, fun decisions, great theme...A solid 8 for me!

This game is great.  It's much easier to entice a non gamer friends into playing when you tell them they get to throw you guys into a volcano, and there can be a fun history lesson for kids.

First play - 2 players - This has been getting alot of good buzz with my group so when Osiris Ra suggested we play a quick 2-player game of it I was in. The theme is great. Pompeii is about to be covered in lava. Place your men and then when the s*** hits the fan run them the hell out of there. It reminded me of Survive! The card playing aspect of it was a little dry. You play your cards and hope to gain extra men by placing one in a building that already has another man in it. Placing your man in a building that already has 3 gives you 3 extra men to place! Then when the volcano erupts the game gets really exciting. YOu have to run before the lava overtakes you and the lava is tiles drawn from the bag. Again luck is a big factor. Its a lot of fun (I did win) and I look forward to trying it with 3 or 4 players.

Fun little game. There are two halves to the game, the former of which might prove interesting with repeated plays but ostensibly is a bit boring, the latter which is when the volcano erupts and is quite fun as you try to save as many of your pawns as possible while attempting to kill other players whenever you control the lava flow.

The game has a lot of luck, but it plays quickly, and it's the sort of game where you hose each other anyway, so what difference does a little bit of bad luck make?  Plus, the fewer players you have in the game, the less chaos there's going to be.  It's reminiscent of Survive!, but it seems bit clunky right out of the box to understand.  It definitely takes a play to understand the flow of the game; by the second playing, we mostly had the flow of the game understood.  My biggest issue with the game is the convoluted way that you set up the deck of cards....

I should add that the first playing of this game left me wondering what I was missing, but by the second game, it made sense, and was a lot of fun.  If your first play was underwhelming, give it another try.

The Downfall of Pompeii has a lot in common with Survive!, if you've ever played that classic game. First you place a bunch of your people down on the board, then you flee to the corners before the volcano gobbles them up. It also delivers the same silly fun of Survive!, that of ruthlessly throwing your opponents' dudes into harm's way.

They should make a category of games on BGG called "Juvenile giggle inducers" and throw this in there, because it is.

This is the lightest game I rate this high; it's just that darned fun.

I have only three complaints, all of which are relatively minor (and certainly don't affect play once the game's started).

1. The draw deck is just a tad complicated to set up, and requires several shuffles.

2. The game only goes to four players.

3. There aren't the same number of pieces of each color.  You can only play specific colors at each player count.  Only red and black have enough pieces for a two player game, for instance.  Since I only ever expect to play with the full four players, I don't think this will be an issue - it just bugs me.

Just played this again for the first time in several years and remembered how fun it is. Simple rules; not a game to play every week, but just enough interesting decisions to make it worthwhile. Tossing meeples in the volcano never gets old.

The Downfall of Pompeii - a great game with significant shift in play once lava hits the board. Jockey for position as you place your people, then run them from lava as they try to escape through the gates of Pompeii.

RATING: 7.4
As under-rated as Sunken City was.  I think this is a great 4-player game.  Well themed strategy game with a theme that's not just pasted on.  Plus it's fun when the volcano blows and everyone must run for it.

This is a very good game for non hardcore players. Phase 1 is setting up the board and phase 2 is more the actual game.
But too light for me.
Sold!

RATING: 8
Maybe worth a higher rating. The second stage of running to escape is very exciting - which one do I move..can he wait till next turn..but there are 3 waiting by the gate..do I save them..I can only save one..which one..how many tiles left..... Excellent light filler, and superb to get non gamers hooked into our world.

My wife LOVES this game.  I think it shines with two players.  She loves putting the people into the volcano.  It is kinda like a puzzle, trying to get the people out of the city.

This is a very fun game and I think the theme is very well implemented. I don't mind that the "lava" starts from within the city. I take this as "most affected areas" by ash rain, poisonous gas etc.
If only they had made the volcano fit in the box...

Reenact the 79AD eruption of Mount Vesuvius in two phases. First, strategically populate the city of Pompeii with color coded meeples followed by lava tile placement onto matching areas of the town thereby throwing its inhabitants ( hopefully mostly theirs) into the volcano while trying to get yours to the escape.

FUN! Actually a cutthroat game without feeling cutthroat.. Plays pretty fast, and throwing cubes into the volcano has never been more fun!!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Players in this game compete to move their playing pieces into the city of Pompeii, and then race frantically to get them safely out after the volcano erupts and the lava starts to flow.  This game is so fun.  A fast-paced family game with a really unique feel.  There is definitely luck, but also plenty of meaningful decisions to make.

An old classic that will go overlooked by new gamers who are blinded by kickstarter crap and dull recommendations for T2R. It's actually quite a bit beyond gateway territory IMO, but worth the effort as a 'first 10 games' purchase.

The game has some great upsides but ultimately it's a light filler game and that category is done a bit better but some other games. Overall I like it but I can't see this being the focus of an evening of gaming.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The first half of this game is kinda dull. But once the volcano erupts it's fun as you try to escape the town before the lava blocks your cubes in place.

I first played this with a middle school teacher who said his students love it. I can see why. The placement of the lava tiles can be just brutal for the other players at the table. And tossing your friend's guys into an actual volcano is pretty dramatic.

Avoid bad losers when you play this game!

RATING: 7
Played several times (with 3 or 4 players). An enjoyable, if not very deep, game. I rather like how the way the board is divided changes as the game progresses. The end game, however, is both too random (the order in which the lava tiles are drawn  can have a huge influence on the final result) and too predictible (since the numbers of tiles of each sort are known exactly).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Not something to play every day, but fun once in a while, mostly because of the excellent theme. To get the most enjoyment out of this game, you [i]must[/i] make sound effects each time a meeple dies or runs.

Plays well with kids. My daughter, who is almost 5 years old, likes it and can play by the full rules (with a tiny bit of help sometimes). If I played my hardest I could win easily, but if I just role play the little terrified meeples and making the moves that seem "most fun" instead of "most likely to win," then we have a fun, close game.

Not a Very exciting game, but provides some strategy and outsmarting, outrunning other players. And you get satisfaction by making long runs and then blocking other players with lava. Though sometimes you can still lose when you think you are doing ok.

RATING: 6.5
Fun game. I have not mastered the strategy of exiting the most meeples quickly. It should only take a couple of more games. It is not a deep game but there is some nice tension and you can be behind in the first phase and still win in the second. If I would fault it, it feels like too much goes on in too short of a time and the different modes of treating buildings in the different phases adds a little complexeity that probably does not need to be there.

This game reminds me of a Queen song.  The beginning plays nothing like the end, but both parts are good.  I like that those I play with don't mechanically chuck the guys into the volcano, but try to make it painful for you, which it should be.

RATING: 9
One of my favourite games and one that I actually win reasonably often (a miracle!). The game is split into three phases: place colonists in the city; place colonists' families in the city; escape impending doom as the volcano explodes. If you can ignore the slightly macabre theme, this is great fun and easy to teach / learn.

Una pequeña joyita, un juego de puteo bien hecho y con puntuaciones muy ajustadas (1000 veces mejor que el tostón "The island") es para 2 a 4 jugadores pero a 5 y 6 (comprando octógonos) funciona muy bien también.

Aunque no debería, a 2 jugadores resulta entretenido.

RATING: 8
After a slightly fiddly setup of the draw deck, this game plays like a breeze. After three plays, I'm enjoying this more and more. Misplayed the game the first time by placing 'relatives' too soon (you have to wait for the first AD 79 card). The last two games were played as a two person affair and one of us ran out of pompeeples early. We adopted the 'early eruption' house rule, and that seemed to work o.k. 

Update: Raising my rating from a 7 to an 8. Games seem to always be very close. Scores for my last four player game 11-9-9-8. Tonight's three player game 11-11-9, game decided by volcano casualties.

Just one play.  The theme of this game is well integrated into the gameplay.  The first half of the game is a little strategic, but fairly bland.  The real fun comes in the second half when lava is pouring all over the city and your little guys have to run for their lives.

Looking forward to trying this title again.

RATING: 5
Easy to learn with very simple mechanics.  I think the strategy to the game lay in the first phase, the placement of your people.  Since the amount of movement they can make during the second half is dependent on how many other pieces are in the same square, it is important that they don't get stranded.  The other thing to note is that having more pieces on the board isn't necessarily a good thing, due to the fact that the number of turns are limited by the tiles available.  I didn't really have fun with Pompeii, not something I would see myself playing any time soon again.

Not bad at all.  This is something I would play sporadically as there's interesting jockeying for positions when attempting to escape.  And the movement rules are kinda cool, too.

在刚开始玩的时候，感觉这个游戏是不是有点太简单，weight太轻了，以至于对他300多名的高排名产生了一些质疑，但是随着游戏的推进，发现游戏是有几个策略点的。

第一个是利用亲友规则，尽可能的多塞人。

第二个则是逃跑时候精算移动力。这一点在玩的时候有种变体跳棋的感觉，这种搭桥蹭移动力的快感和德式打combo刷刷有异曲同工之妙，这点设计的很赞。

第三个是初始的布局，虽然靠近城门的位置看起来比较赞，但是也离火山喷发孔会比较近，因此可能来不及动就挂在滚滚的岩浆中。城中的建筑物比较远，但是容纳人的上限多，一旦人数起来了，你的移动力会变得很强，当然无论这个建筑容纳人数多或少，最后动的人肯定是很亏的。布局还是需要多多揣摩，并且要根据其他玩家的布局来调整自己的策略。

第四个是放置岩浆板块，有时候可以围杀一片别人的居民。

总体来说，这款游戏咋一看可能没有想象中那么对得起300名的排名。但是实际玩起来还是有很多优点和策略点的，长安灯上面已经点出。但是游戏还是偏向于一个抽象棋游戏的感觉，变化少了一些，没有多路线的广度思维，耐玩性略差了一些。

Building your engine in this game is so much fun. There are so many different strategies that you can try, and the cards really dictate the course of the game. I would say that drafting is a must. 

Solo gameplay is great. CO-OP we played 12 generations with 12 starting income and the need to terraform completely. That was a lot of fun!

RATING: 7.5
Good fun, nice mix of card play, tile laying and resource production.

Lovely production quality (apart from the player boards which are flimsy and impractical), beautiful artwork on the cards and board.  It all looks very attractive.

Our 4 player game took us about 4 hours but everyone was very absorbed and didn't notice the time pass.  We played 4 player again (4 hours again) and that time I felt it went on a bit long really and was glad when it ended.

There were three things I didn't like so much.  The main thing I wasn't so keen on was that you might have spent some time developing your position towards a particular bonus/milestone only to have another player take the third and final slot, which means that your effort was wasted. 

I also didn't like the "Most science" award which obliged me to keep looking closely at all the cards all the other players had played, to see if I could succeed at it.  With small icons on lots of cards placed some way from me I had to keep leaning over the board to scrutinize what my opponents had played.  A bit tiresome.

And in both games I've been a recipient of the minor "take that" type of event in which another player plays an event card and chooses which player loses 3 or even 6 plants. If your plant production is only 1 per round it's a bit frustrating to have your efforts arbitrarily ruined by a random event.

Overall I enjoyed the game and would have scored it a 9 without the niggles mentioned above.

Tip: keep your player board some distance in front of you.  The board is slippery and the marker cubes you place on it are easily scattered by a passing sleeve.

After 3 games I can conclude that I very much like this game. It has everything I like in a game: huge pool of different cards, engine building, good amount of player interaction, area control and blocking others...

There are a few things that I don't like, but they don't affect gameplay - graphic design could have been better and the player board... is not just ugly, but the UX is just plain bad. Markers can be bumped, marking your production over 10 is just clunky. It should have been a lot better.

Regarding the gameplay, I can see that it may be possible that this game could suffer from "bad hand drawn" (as any other card driven game) but we are still to see if that has that much influence since you can mitigate bad draws in lots of ways.

For now, this is a solid 9 for me. One of the top games on my shelf. I hope it stays that way.

We've tried it with:
2 players - good
4 players - fantastic

Love this game. It's a fun theme with limited luck and solid engine building. The map gets stale (and I'm not itching for the expansion), but there's enough variety

Amazing game. All the whiners about the components or people that claim to knock the cubes around "multiple times per game"?  Ignore them.  Components are fine.  Card artwork is great for me.  Learn how to control where your hands and elbows are.  Enjoy the game immensely every time I play, win or lose. I will play with or without drafting.  Once you know the various paths and strategies, I do not see drafting adding gobs of time unless you have an AP animal playing.  I have to admit - it's not fun when people target your plants with asteroids, haha.

6/27/2017 Update: I've now played the game several more times.  Due to the necessity of drafting to make the game fair, it does tend to take 3.5-4 hours to play. I admit I tend to freeze up a bit and the game might move faster with people who a) know cards well and b) aren't prone to AP. That said, I love this game. I appreciate the strategy a lot more than when I first played it and am thoroughly enjoying developing synergies between corporations & cards. It's also surprisingly interactive: although direct attacks are rare, there is a lot of blocking that can happen, and another player's actions can greatly affect the profitability of your action at certain points in the game. It'd be a perfect 10 if not for the length issue (..it does always feel too long, for some reason) and if the components were better. Specifically, the player mats are easy to damage (even just by putting them not carefully enough in the box) and really need to be double-layered with indents to place cubes on. Every time I play this game, the cubes get knocked over, often several times per game. If it wasn't for those two things, it'd be an absolute 10.
--
One play so far. Wonderful game - lived up to my expectations. I don't know if it's truly all that unique, but there's plenty of strategy, many feasible strategies, and fun card synergies. My only concern was that for a teaching game, it took us almost five hours. I don't know why exactly - maybe we all took too much time to think, maybe the rules explanation was unusually long, maybe because it was so long until anyone built greenery, but the long playtime makes it a more niche audience game for me. I enjoyed it thoroughly and never felt bored or like it was actually 'too' long at all, but it was certainly a surprise given the time on the box.

RATING: 6
2 plays / 3 players

LIKE: An enormous amount of unique cards and the cards are thematically fun, from asteroids to amoebas. Lots of combos to discover, and a possibility to build a big engine. Some interaction when racing towards objectives before others, creating some tension. I liked hanging on to powerful cards that could be used later.

DISLIKE: Iconography overload and tiny text on cards. It took me a while to understand the flow of the game. It takes one entire play to digest the different cards and how they work together. Difficult to directly slow another player down. The player mats are fiddly. The game plays on the long side, which turns me off.

OVERALL: A fun card-driven, engine building game. We draft cards each round, which increases playtime. Sifting through cards and trying to figure out combos is the game. So therefore, the more you know the cards, the better you do. This game keeps my interest for now, but I am finding it too long.

My initial impression on Terraforming Mars was positive. Relatively good looking with an interesting theme. Symbology was a bit daunting and we needed a few rounds of play before we began to understand what was really going on. The rules are not the most intuitive ones but not the worst either.

Basically you are just trying to build up your resource production by buying cards so that you can buy victory points by playing further cards, constructing buildings or by terraforming the planet. There is some competition for certain milestones awarding VPs for the first player reaching the milestone or for having the most of something at the end of the game. The meat of the game is in choosing your strategy and setting up your engine for it. Which cards to play and in which order, is the question. 

After the game I felt like I could play again. However, there is one major concern I have about Terraforming Mars... The game does not have a fixed duration. Instead it is on the players' responsibility to push the game to the end. And my worrying observation is that the mechanics do not necessarily encourage working towards triggering the game end. This might make the game drag unnecessarily long which is never good. Another negative about the game is that after a while the necessary information becomes scattered all over the table which slows down the play when you are squinting to read the symbols on other players' cards (which will be many). 

One more thing that is not necessarily a negative but in my opinion does not make the game any better is the "take that" cards in the game. Sure, in the end game they serve a purpose if you need to prevent someone from ending the game too soon but in early to mid game these cards can be quite devastating for the victim's playing experience. They also slow down the game even further.

But in the end I found the game ok, although I have my concerns that some sessions may be very long and frustrating.

Update: Drafting and adding corporations to the mix significantly improved this game. It's now a solid 10 in my book, and the components do not even matter.

Great game, but man those components are horrible. Overpriced for what you get in the box. However, it is so good that I cannot rate it under 9!

I'm a sucker for card games so this one gets +2 rating only because it's a card driven game.

The good:
+ the theme
+ card combos (if you are lucky to get the right cards at the right time)

The bad:
- there is no way to search the deck, so you have to play whatever you happen to get
- luck factor is very high
- choices are obvious 
- the game plays it self
- to long for what it is
- low replay value
- low quality components

A very enjoyable game, overall, that offers much to discover; the luck of the draw prevents consistent strategies, but maybe that is an asset really. 
Of course, interaction is limited, and it is tricky to keep an eye on everything your opponents do, but this has received its accolades not without reason.

I feel like this game is "fine" but there's something about it that I'm missing.

More plays needed maybe?

I like the game a lot, but is way too long for the type of game it is, meaning that in my experience with my groups after 2 hours people start to get bored and the gameplay starts to get repetitive. Being so long also means that at the end it starts to get hard to keep track of all the bonuses, actions and combos that you unlock. Every game that I played someone forgot about something that they could've done because of that. But I like the game, just wish it was shorter.

Excellent game!  I love the balance between income and playing cards.  While the choices felt too broad my first game, it really is just a matter of learning the game.  There are a number of strategies and, while luck of the card draw can push-pull on them, I feel that there are enough draws to mitigate this in the long run (over a game).  It's like Race for the Galaxy - you have to learn which cards to play and which cards to ignore and when to do each.

I will play this again.  Rating could improve (to a 10) with more plays.

This is a great engine-building game, where you have to raise temperature, oxygen level and sea level on Mars, by building cities and green areas. The engine building consists in playing different types of cards in your area: green cards for one time bonuses, blue cards for extra actions and red cards which give you instant resources. The downside of this, that besides the main board there is only a minimum interaction between the players, and getting familiar with the huge amount of cards and finding out the optimum chains can also take up time. Overall it is good game: easy to learn and fun to play.

Dec - :d10-5:

1st play: Really an enjoyable game.  The cards and actions are thematic, if a bit random.  Mars is the new-hotness theme and this game does it well.  I enjoyed the thematic text on the cards and although it played loosely with the science, it felt close enough to be believable. I think the game would be improved by drafting as it feels a bit multi-player solitaire without that.  I think if drafting is not used, then there needs to be a way to increase number of cards drawn, or at least be able to spend money to cycle cards in some way.

2nd play: Not nearly as good as the first playthrough.  The length was way too long, vast differences in corporate powers and drafting helped some, but not too much with the random cards feel.  There is almost no interaction between players other than occasional comets which you just lob at whoever has the most plants saved up.  These comets can be crushing if you've saved up enough plants to set up a combo, all the way to meaningless if no one has any plant life or if turn order is such that they can spend plants before you get a turn.  The theme is still amazing but that's about it.

Note: This is one of few games where the plays are so different that I'm not exactly sure how to rate it.  I am willing to bet there's a good game in here, but the card selection mechanism bugged me through both plays and I really didn't feel like there was much interaction.  The theme is so good that I want to try it again, but I'm dreading a 4 hour long slog like my last playthrough.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Excelent game. It really feels into the theme and is different from every game I played before. Of course a lot of mechanics are familiar to me, but it really feels unique. The interaction with other players exists, but is not all that big. It focus a lot on the cards and synergy with the company chosen combined with some standard projects and actions. Great solo experience!

This game is a heartbreak. I love the theme and hard sci-fi, but couldn't get past its faults:
- much too long for what it is (played the draft variant, and would not want to play it otherwise, too much randomness otherwise)
- pointless "take that" elements

Would much rather play Race for the galaxy, which plays in a fraction of the time with imho superior depth, or Deus, if having a board associated with a card based engine builder is wanted.

It's a good game. It's an engine builder. I can see some room for improvement with some things. 

1. Use something else for tracking plants, money, etc. Cardboard with holes, like what Clash of Cultures does, would work well. 

2. Something like the Councillor role from San Juan would be good. That is, search a few cards in the deck, keep one, and discard the others.

Played twice. The first game was really just learning it.  That might be a downside, as new players would really be at a disadvantage to those who've played before. Potential to be a great game, but needs a group (at least 3) who can get it to the table often to be worthy.

Terraforming Mars has been a BGG darling since its release. Usually, this means I'm going to either love or hate the game (BGG top 100 is just a dumb popularity contest, and popular is not the same as great). In this case, I found myself on the supportive side of the game.

The gameplay consists of building your tableau from resources by paying for cards. Like Race for the Galaxy and other tableau builders, these card contribute to some kind of future endeavor until finally the game ends. This part of the game seems really nice and tight. It's enjoyable to have those extra blue cards for alternate actions, green cards for nice traditional passives, and reds for expensive but powerful one time effects.

The board is where the game first starts to show signs of design neglect. There just isn't a whole lot of interesting stuff going on, on Mars...the titular character of the game. With only 3 basic tiles and a rare sprinkling of a few unique tiles, the board looks very homogenous during play. At the end of the game, barely anything has changed on the surface, due to the weird placement rules. It's understandable that the sparesness represents that your only goal is the bare minimum of terraforming, however it does make the board feel like an incredibly waste of space (and time).

Obviously like any randomized card-based game, the cards can be really devilish to one player at the table. In this game, if that's you, you're not having a good time. Be aware of this going in. On the flipside, any player who happens to get insanely good early card drafts is going to be nigh-unseatable for most of the game.

One criticism I have for the scoring system is how absolutely required the awards et al are. You cannot skip being the first (or most) at something in the game, otherwise you miss out on 5 VP which is quite a lot. This is a problem since people tend to rush the first-to-do-whatever conditions for the guaranteed VPs and it's like a game of musical chairs in some cases, where you know one player is never going to win but they have to remain playing under the obviously false pretense that they could pull some magical 5 VP out of their ass that no one else can.

The card quality is pretty poor (couldn't even play without sleeves) but the board looks very nice. Card art is hit or miss and while I can tolerate the card UI, as a designer I feel that it's obtuse with its early 2000's internet gradients.

Despite its negative points, Terraforming mars is a very tactile and satisfying game to play. When you're done, you can look at your tableau (not necessarily the board) and feel like you really accomplished all those projects and contributed to bettering humanity. Due to the simulationist feel that doesn't make TOO many sacrifices to gameplay, I have to recommend this one. Maybe not as heavily as its popularity suggests, but nevertheless it's enjoyable.

Yes, it's an engine-builder; but it FEELS like a civ-building game set on Mars, and gives a much greater sense of that than the inferior game Race to the Galaxy (and mechanically, TM is  much more streamlined). 

Yes, to an extent, it's multi-player solitaire; but again, it doesn't feel that way! Awards and milestones are so important that you must constantly be watching to see how your opponents are progressing.

Absolutely gorgeous game! It's very, very rare when I enjoy a sci-fi game (or engine-builders, for that matter); but as a civ game done right, this is one of the best efforts ever!

In the 2400s, mankind begins to terraform the planet Mars. Giant corporations, sponsored by the World Government on Earth, initiate huge projects to raise the temperature, the oxygen level, and the ocean coverage until the environment is habitable. In Terraforming Mars, you play one of those corporations and work together in the terraforming process, but compete for getting victory points that are awarded not only for your contribution to the terraforming, but also for advancing human infrastructure throughout the solar system, and doing other commendable things.

Maybe the ultimate engine builder? A major sense of progression and building, both in your own tableau and in the shared terraforming process. You need to consider what others are doing spatially to try to max your score, and when to push the terraforming in order to end the game (or prolong it conversely), but solitaire in many ways. Still very satisfying, even in a loss or close game it is highly enjoyable. Drafting is required

Quite enjoyable, best played 3-4. Very easy to learn rules and exceptions. The solo version is also very good, as you have more than 230 project cards, no game will ever feel alike previous ones. 
The only complain about it is the quality of the markers, materials in general are not very good compared with the price. If you don't wanna miss a thing, you gotta need a little toolbox; and would be a good idea to get some sleves for cards, as well as plastic covers for player tables...it could be a good idea to use some other tokens as extra resouce markers, I used some to sort as 20 and 50 pieces.

Besides the material issues, the game is great. I'd suggest to read the Official FAQ at the forums to clarify some missunderstanings.

Terraforming Mars does have excellent fidelity to its theme; players are rewarded for warming and oxygenating the environment, and for placing lakes.    These activities also act as a clock, with the game ending when the planet is inhabitable.  There are alternative strategies around mining, settlement building, power generation and the greening of the planet. 

The game's engine is tableau building and as tableau builders tend to be, it is pretty solitaire-ish.  Interaction is limited to some minor take thatery.  Stop blubbing, it is minor.  As with other turn-based tableau builders, there is quite a lot of downtime.  In the one game I have played it seemed as though money just wasn't tight enough and the end game really dragged as those capable of raising the temperature instead chased the leader.  The hex map of the surface of Mars serves little purpose beyond corralling the players' developments.

The artwork has come in for some criticism; it is somewhat uneven.  Production quality is decent.

I like its low level of direct interaction, with quite a lot of indirect one.

RATING: 6
I love the theme of this game, the emphasis on raising the temperature and oxygen levels, and the forest, ocean and city building.  I give these elements a 9 of 10.   I also appreciate the "labor of love" feel of this game, crafting (and presumably balancing) all the cards, etc.   

Having said that, for my gamer tastes, Terraforming Mars did not provide a particularly interesting or compelling gaming experience.  Virtually the entire game consisted of collecting and playing cards within the confines of my private player tableau.  Then, after we had built up our huge collections of cards, the game ended, and we tallied up the points.  During our game, the other players showed virtually no interest in my cards, and likewise, I showed no interest in their cards.  All in all, Terraforming Mars felt like it was about 95% multiplayer solitaire.

Admittedly, there are a lot of cards to read and think about, and as such, there are a lot of card combinations to ponder and potentially test out in future plays.  So, yes, if you like card combo games with lots of re-ployability, this could be a good game for you.  Unfortunately, I am not a card combo gamer, and I prefer much more player interaction in my games.  Having little interest in playing the game again, have to give it a 6.

Best game of 2016 for me. 50+ plays and still enjoying it very much. Love the theme. Multiple strategies. I do not think it is that long because it has a nice pace (no ap). We use the draft variant and i do not think it is luck dependant that way. The nastiness of some cards is overstated since they hardly have impact on the game. They just add a little spice and interaction which is needed to make the game a richer experience.

Terraforming Mars, the game that takes Race For The Galaxy as a starting point, removes the phases, adds a board and 4-6x the play time.

I wanted to like this game.  Race isn't my favourite, but I like it for what it is, and I hoped TM would improve upon that while making even more of a game out of it.  Unfortunately, it's almost the opposite.  You have a game with all the same problems as Race (that your strategy is mostly dictated by the cards you are dealt, and that you have very little control over what those cards are), but without the interesting phase mechanisms (this'll be hit or miss depending on the person, but I think phases are the best part of Race and without them TM has almost zero player interaction), and takes a whole lot longer to play out.  
It just isn't worth it.  I understand what people like about this game, but it's so much more fluff than substance.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A game that's absolutely steeped in the near-future science of colonising the Red Planet. Richly themed science games are rare, and most of them (looking at Phil Eklund) are more simulation than game. The game play here is rich, engrossing, and as well-oiled a euro tableau building game as you could ask for. Interaction with other players is indirect but present, either racing to complete milestones or jockeying for position on the planet's surface.

Hearing about the take-that elements on some of the cards (e.g., "remove 2 plants from another player") was a worry . I'm quite sensitive to the issue and consider it a design flaw in a game that isn't explicitly about conflict. In practice, it's usually no more than a minor annoyance. You could even make the case that it's a useful disincentive to stockpiling resources. If it still annoys you, an easy fix might be to house rule that "remove X" effects are equally distributed among different players rather than targeting only one.

The criticism about terrible art I think is much ado about nothing. I appreciate art, and found the art on the cards perfectly nice looking and appropriate to the theme. There are plenty of games with BAD art, and I don't think this is one of them. The symbols on the cards are clear, sensible, and always well explained with text.

My favourite game! Yes, it is a euro game, but it offers so many opportunities to sabotage other players that it is definitely not a typical euro, and very much a masterpiece. The element of luck is quite pronounced, but less so after you move from the basic rules to the extended ones.. which could be by your second game.
Just one thing: why why why did you not choose one consistent style for the art on the cards?! Some pictures are cool futuristic cgis, some are shitty 3d drawings and others are just stupid stock photos. Sadly this eats at the immersion surprisingly much!

Much simpler to play than I thought it would be, but also much more interesting. The game isn't overwrought with rules and offers some incredibly interesting card combinations for each strategy. The artwork on the cards is a bit of a mixed bag with some cards having varying quality drawings, computer renderings, and stock photographs which makes them look like they're all from different games instead of forming a cohesive package. Cards themselves are almost required to be sleeved as they have black borders that are easily marked and feel cheap in quality. The box as well feels incredibly flimsy and cheap. The gameplay, however, is excellent and is enough to overshadow these questionable production decisions.

Not sure what all the hype is about this game. The VP conditions seem so arbitrary like 1VP for every Forrest and every Forrest that touches one of your cities. 

Second major problem is the sheer magnitude of cards (and associated card text) and the luck of the draw. One player got a 2VP card that only needed 11 gold and other cards seemed much weaker. I'd be curious to get an analysis of the cards and see how people think about card draw variability.

Played two additional times and with the drafting variant it got better.  With experienced players, the gameplay time is reduced significantly (very good analogy is Race for the Galaxy).  Intrigued to play this more.

Upgraded to a 9 after 5 plays.  Drafting helps a lot and with experienced players without AP, this games goes very quickly.

Rating is for 2 player game only.

The game is fun but the endgame really drags with 2 players as it does not seem that the perceived leader can be caught up to. This leads to a weird, lopsided 'excitement against time' progression. Terraforming Mars is very intriguing and fun in the first couple of generations but gets less and less interesting the more global factors have been closed off, as many parts of your engine became more or less useless.

Probably a better (and shorter) game with 3 or more players

Lo compramos entre Alejandro, Isma y yo

Es muy buen juego, me gusta los combos que puedes llegar a hacer con las carta, la construcción de losetas y los parámetros de oxígeno, temperatura y océanos.
Temáticamente está muy bien conseguido.
Lo malo son los componentes, para el precio que tiene los componentes son malísimos,  sobre todo los tableros de jugador que son de cartulina se doblan y mantener los recursos en él sin que se muevan puede llegar a ser una pesadilla.
Los cubitos de cobre, plata y oro pierden su capa de imprimación sólo con mirarlos.
Y todo esto por 60€ ¡qué horror!, comparado con el Feast for Odin o Scythe es una mierda, es cierto que los otros dos juegos son más caros, pero la calidad y la cantidad de componentes que traen es impresionante.

En este se lo podían haber currado un poco más.

I have only played with 2 people so far. Love this game. I found it fairly easy to learn and love the options for actions while playing. I feel that I could teach this game without too much effort to an experienced gamer and newer gamers could grasp it without too much extra effort.

It is great when every question on why do I want to do such and such always comes back to the theme of the game. And here that theme is beautifully executed. 

Plays well with many different player counts, beginner corps lack of initial research phase is nice to get the ball rolling for new players --> however much less fun to play an unthemed corporation : theres probably some house rule to hit the right cost balance for giving a real corporation but avoiding that choice of 10. 
Advanced game without initial resources is much longer, yet more satisfying watching things grow.

Got drawn to the game because it ranked high. (#5 at the time of comment)

I personally is not a super big fan - I'd give it 5 ~ 6 stars. But it always a big hit when I bring it out; so I bumped the rating up solely because of that. To me, it feels like a glorified Race for the Galaxy; both games share similar problems - the sheer randomness and the feel-bad moments when you went through the whole game without finding life XD. The components also leave something to be desired as well.

Sorry, German Review, because I already wrote it up for a German friend:

Terraforming Mars ist ein gutes Spiel, wenn auch vielleicht etwas overhyped. Im Prinzip gefällt es mir sehr gut. Es hat allerdings zwei Nachteile: Zum einen ist die Qualität der Komponenten wirklich nicht gut. Schade für so ein teures Spiel, aber man kann damit leben. Der andere, gravierende Minuspunkt ist, dass es eine ganze Menge von Karten gibt, die destruktive Effekte für wählbare Mitspieler haben, z.B. sowas haben wie "Klaue einem beliebigen Mitspieler X Ressourcen". Oft auch Ressourcenproduktion, was für den Betroffenen gerade am Anfang des Spiels noch deutlich schlimmer ist. Mein größtes Problem damit ist, dass ich mir überhaupt einen Spieler aussuchen muss/kann, den es trifft. Ich will einfach nicht entscheiden müssen, wen von meinen Mitspielern ich "am wenigsten mag". Das hätte man auch anders designen können. Dazu kommt noch, dass dieser Wert "X" in manchen Fällen gar nicht mal klein ist, in einigen Fällen höher als die Produktion dieser Ressource in einer gesamten Runde. Im schlimmsten Fall hat man sich seinen Zug schon genau durchgeplant, wird beklaut und kann dann nur noch passen und erst in der nächsten Runde wieder etwas machen. Sehr schade. Ich hätte dem Spiel sicherlich eine 8 gegeben, vielleicht sogar 8.5, wenn der Designer das besser hinbekommen hätte. Diese destruktiven Spielelemente beeinflussen mein Spielgefühl allereings so gravierend, dass es bei einer 6.5 bleiben musste.

Amazing Euro game with a scientific twist. We have all been hearing about this game for months, so there isnt much I can write here that has not already been written, however, based on the fact I gave it a 9 means I quite enjoy it. 

Another gamer in our group recently purchased Terra Mystica, and after a few play through of that, we found we really enjoyed those mechanics, so we were hoping this would offer some of the same which it does. I have played 3 times now, and really look forward to it hitting the table a lot more in the future.


Solo Play - As an intro to teach others, I  attempted it once, and I didn't have a great grasp on the rules, so it went pretty bad. I look forward to playing again with a full grasp on the rules.

3 Player game - We all played with the beginner corp and no advanced cards. The game went slow and we missed a few (major) rules. All three of us really enjoyed it and looked forward to playing again.

4 Player game - We have done one 4 player game so far. It went well, 3 of the players had played once and one was new. The 3 selected our corporations and the newbie used the beginner corp as per the instructions. We used all advanced corp cards as well, which made a huge difference. The game went well but dragged...4+ hours.

Pros - Too many to name, but the biggest that comes to mind is the theme of it all. There are real reasons behind what you're doing, when you do it. The mechanics are solid, but the theme makes sense and when the two work together, it really shines.

Cons - the art is not very consistent. It seems to be photo-realistic in some areas, and cartoonish in others. The player and resource pieces are too small and light. This would be fine if they just sat, but there is a lot of movement and a lot of them. It can be very difficult to keep tabs on them etc. The length is a bit off from whats on the box. Of the 3 games I've played, the average length is about 3 hrs. I suppose it could get down to around 2.5 if you really pushed the standard projects, but 90 mins?...I don't think that's possible for our group.

Calling those things "cons" is tough because its like knocking Super Mario Bros. for poor graphics. It all comes down to game play, theme & mechanics, which this has nailed.

Terraforming Mars is an amazing game, and is an instant classic. Get it.

4/20/17:  I'm going to raise this to an 8 for solo play, but only a six for group play.  I think that you have less control with more players.  I like playing with 2-3 more than playing with 4.  Sleeved cards are a pain to shuffle, but I think that they'd be starting to  show noticable wear otherwise.  The companies are: Econoline, Helion, Interplanetary, Inventrix, Mining Guild, Phoblog, Saturn Systems, Teractor, Throgate, UNMI, 

4/6/17:  I saw this being played everywhere at Gamestorm 19, the local game convention.  I've got over 20 plays in, so I probably need to raise my rating to a 7, especially for solitaire play.  I finally figured out solo play correctly.  You only start with 14 income, not 20.  Makes it much harder.  No matter which faction you play, the cards can screw you.

10/22/16:  Reminds me of Seven Wonders, Hansa Teutonica and Suburbria.  Very tactical on first play and the last third feels a little processional.  It might start feeling more strategic with more plays.  Not sure how long this will stay interesting. 208 cards.

A somewhat overrated economy optimizing game. Interaction is quite low and mostly negative (and the draft mechanics for cards makes the game take 2 hours more, so I cannot recommend it).

It feels like you really terraforming Mars. If you new in resource management, the game teaches you a lot. My two first plays were pretty frustrating in terms of trying to win at my wonderful partner who's a guru of resource management. So, if you're ready to grow spiritually and professionally, this game is for you. Don't trust those who writes that it takes two hours. To enjoy, think and made decisions, 3 hours is a minimum. Highly recommend!

Only played once so far, 2-player. Surprisingly easy to learn despite the rulebook being slightly opaque in places, and the huge amount of iconography.

We started with normal corporations, rather than the beginner, too.

This is one slick game, with mechanics that just about purr. We'll definitely be trying corporation era next game, and I would like to try card drafting because it very much felt like luck was on the other player's side. Lots of synergy in his cards, and he build a fantastic engine very quickly, that generated plenty of TR/VP & money.

I, on the other hand, never got any Power or Space cards, and couldn't get much going in terms of smooth engines until very late in the game. But I did get Phobos and Ganymede, which my opponent was desperate, so that felt nice ;)

Still, it was challenging, engaging, and extremely thematic. Really looking forward to another game.

Will agree with others those - those player mats are complete crap for the game's price.

Initial rating, based on a single 2-player game. I absolutely love the theme, attention to detail and general wonkiness of this game. I understand the complaints about artwork and sliding components, but am not personally bothered by either of it.

I fear the game might have too much of a snowball engine effect, though I do see enough traces of mechanics that ameliorate it, so I won't let my rating be affected by that fear, yet. I suspect the game will probably be more enjoyable with 3 or 4 players than with 2, as then I'd expect actual jockeying for position on the planet, which was now mostly absent.

Be kell vallanom, hogy engem elvitt a játék hype-ja, ezért elfogult vagyok vele szemben. :)
Sokan szidják a design-t, de szerintem teljesen rendben van, 1-2 dolgot leszámítva (nyersanyagtáblákon elcsúszó kockák, gagyi képek a kártyákon).
A játék eleje picit nyögvenyelős, de pár forduló után beérik az addigi munkánk gyümölcse. Ha már egy kicsit jobban ismerjük a lapokat, akkor már iszonyat jó kombókat tudunk generálni. 
A single módot is kipróbáltam, ami nagyon jó lett. Persze tudom, hogy ez elsősorban társasjáték, de számomra fantasztikus élmény volt, hogy egyedül vittem véghez a bolygó terraformálását.  Én arra biztatnék mindenkit, hogy próbálja ki, mert úgy is fantasztikus élményt ad! 

Update, 2018.01.12: Érdekes, de eddig ez az egyetlen társasjáték, ami soloban a legélvezetesebb. Ha többen játszunk, úgy kivész belőle a tematikus jelleg, mert csak a pontszerzésre és a győzelemre koncentrál mindenki, a Terraformálás izgalma teljesen háttérbe szorul. Ellenben ha egyedül vagyunk, úgy sokkal nagyobb kihívást és izgalmat rejt magában, mivel be van határolva a Terraformáláshoz szükséges generációk száma, és a megakreditünk is visszább van fogva.

A thematic euro, with a huge deck of unique and thematically appropriate cards. Playing this game does feel like you are playing a depoliticized version of Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars trilogy, with mining projects, building mines, boreholes, lakes, forest and cities and even terraforming the Galilean moons and sending an interstellar expedition.

It's not without its flaws. It is somewhat thin on player interaction beyond take that cards and some light blocking. More problematic is the achievements and milestones, this game's 6-cost developments. They feel so arbitrary and artificial. I can understand how they didn't want to put them in the deck, but could have had their own deck, with more thematic tie-in?

This is such a great game. Looking at the board of a hexagonal Mars surface one can only think how boring the game would be. WRONG. The game has tons of strategy, multiple paths to victory and if you purchase the new edition with the expansion included (plus the upcoming expansion) there are tons of options out there to keep playing and having a different experience everytime. I've played three times now, with groups of 5, 4, 5. The games do last 90-120 minutes, but that I think was mostly due to a learning curve for new players and one of our friends who is a notorious slow player.

That being said, my only complaint is the quality of the player mat, it feels like a cheaply produced color paper printout. I understand that all player mats aren't created equal (thank you Scythe for ruining every game for me moving forward) but they could have upped the quality just a bit. That being said, with this game investment in something from the broken token may be a good idea. Also the box is barren, dividers would be nice. Again another plug for broken token. This game is great and I want to play again and again.

I like they basic concept of terraforming a planet together. The shared parameters of O2 and temprature is a neat idea and adds to the feeling. Card drafting + building is something I always like in games. 
Many paths appear to be narrow though and the actual tile laying at the map appears to be a bit disconnected to the rest of the game.

Our learning game took a long time, but was satisfying and fun. However, second game revealed a problem - with "special power" corporations in play, you need specific types of cards to take advantage of your personal special abilities. But you're subject to random draw to get those cards, and if you don't get the right cards in the first few turns, you are stuck spinning your wheels.

Further, it can have a lot of downtime, especially when players try to maximize the effectiveness of their turns - I spent fifteen minutes waiting, already knowing what I was going to do on my turn, and that's frustrating.

Decent and good, but too prone to randomness and downtime for us.

I really enjoy the theme and arc of this game but the combined graphic/game design  issues will likely get in the way of me acquiring the game. 

On the graphic design side: the game is problematic without using a game "frame" accessory to lock in your production and resources. One nudge of the table and the accounting becomes a mess. Also not a fan of the inconsistent art direction. 

On the game design side: generally speaking some of the chrome gets in the way of the game while also making the game longer than feels absolutely necessary. While the chrome makes the story arc interesting, it creates problematic cross table information tracking. 

While the game design choices wouldn't stop me from buying the game, the graphic design choices will. Without a "deluxe" reimagining and republishing (along the lines of a Scythe production), I won't be picking this up. I'll gladly play on someone else's copy who's made the extra investment in the required tracking accessories. A deluxe version might rate at 8.0-8.5 for me.

RATING: 7
It's an enjoyable game which can really suffer due to high amount of randomness and can outstay its welcome. 

Lots of things to like, but games can be pretty long (around 3 hours no problem) and if you are out of luck, the whole game from start to finish can feel really frustrating, which is a big problem for a game of this length. Especially for a euro where you want to plan you strategy. In TM you are trying to get the best out of the cards you get, instead of actively trying to form a strategy (which might be possible if you are getting the cards you need, but with the amount of cards in the game, it's not reliable). 
Drafting might mitigate a bit of randomness, but can bring other problems, like lengthening an already long game or 'hate drafting'. My 2nd game was a 3 hour long exercise in frustration from the very start to the end. Left a sour taste in my mouth, will see after future play(s).

Another problem of the game is the fact that there doesn't seem to be much choice. Every turn it's pretty obvious what you should play from the cards you've been dealt, you simply play the best cards you get and hope they'll be good enough. The only limit becomes the money you can spend.

Lassan kezdek hozzászokni, hogy totál nyelvfüggő játékokat is kiadnak magyarul, sőt már szinte mindent, ami a fősodorba tartozik. A Mars az eddigi legörvendetesebb magyarítások egyike. Sajnos a szabályban vannak hibák, némelyik elég durva, de ez sem szegte kedvem, bizakodóan álltam hozzá. 
Ami tetszik, hogy nagyon tematikus a játék. (Az extra lapok nélkül próbáltuk, azok állítólag kevésbé Mars-specifikusak.) A szabály olvasásakor a Dominant Species jutott eszembe, mert ott is nagyon jó tematikusak az akciók, de azért az egy komolyabb és letisztultabb játék, de ettől még a Mars is nagyon jó.

A 3 célszám nem tűnik túl kiegyenlítettnek, nekünk a hőmérséklet nagyon könnyen és hamar felszaladt. A szívatásokat mi nem használtuk, mondjuk nem is lett volna sok, 2-3 eset volt csak, de senki nem használta ki, ez inkább csak tapogatózó parti volt. Egy éles játékban viszont nagyon durván keresztbe lehet tenni némelyik lappal a másiknak. Sértődősek kerüljék szerintem.
A cégek tetszenek, mert elég eltérő stratégiákat támogatnak. A díjak és a mérföldkövek is jók, bár utóbbi visz azért egy kis lutrit bele, de szerintem jobb, mintha random célkártyák lennének. A térképes része nincs túlbonyolítva, de mégis elég érdekes.
Nekünk 3 fővel 3 óra volt tisztán, de egy szólót szerintem simán lenyomok 40-50 percen belül, majd ki is próbálom hamarosan remélem. A szabály nem vészes, 20-30 perc alatt elmondható.
Mostanában ezt a játékot vártam legjobban. Nem ugrott azonnal a top10-embe, de szívesen játszom vele, és még akár kedvenc is lehet.
Sok helyen hallottam, hogy vékonyak a kártyák. Ez igaz, de kártyavédőzve nem zavaró.

A Solid economic game. The solo is fun. A bit long with beginners. The component is subpar though.

Edit: Raise the rating to 9. One of my favorite game so far. This game get better with multiple plays.

Played with corporations cards and drafting system. Do not add these variation with casual boardgamers or Analysis paralysis person. The game will be 3 time longer than it should be. My Analysis paralysis friend took so much time choosing his cards during the draft that I almost gave up after 4 hours. Even the beginner player was faster BY FAR!!! Great game nonetheless and one of my favorite game with Through the Ages.

2 more plays. Easily one of my favorite game. It's a 3 hours game with a lot of fun.

I just didn't feel the buzz, I felt like I was struggling to build an engine, with random parts, that often didn't fit, which stifled my ability to build said engine.

Having played this twice, I don't see the hype. It's a pleasant game (although there are 'take that!' cards) but to me this seems to be a mountain climbing game, the best short term play is probably the best long term play. You do have to decide what to do and take what the deck gives you, its not without interesting but the number of real decision points (as compared to points where there are decisions, but where most of them are easily wrong) seems pretty low. 

I could be wrong.

Rating -- Indifferent Plus, willing to play a few more times to see if I'm right, but not desperate.

Played it once, a 3-player game. We felt it was an ok game, yet it overstayed its welcome. We played the shorter variant with advanced corporations, no drafting. So almost the simplest game, apart from the corporations and the initial purchasing of cards (which we did). Yeah... my fears about limited interaction turned out to be right. There's a big emphasis on your own engine optimization. There *is* interaction though, and it potentially may be significant with more experienced players: on the map, fights for milestones, awards or final opportunities for terraforming. We just felt that most of the time we weren't really interested in what cubes other players pushed left and right on their player boards. Interaction came close to the end. However the game lasted more than 2 hours, so we were a bit tired towards the end. Then we felt like there was a luck of draw. Could be fixed by the official drafting variant, but at the same time the game would drag even longer. Overall we think there are better games with limited interaction that we can play in shorter time, which we enjoy more at the same time: The Castles of Burgundy, Bruges and Suburbia came to our minds, they kind of scratch the same itch for us (although imo Suburbia has nice level of interaction, but it has that tableau building thing).
With that said, it's a decent game, but there are so many better ones, so it's up for trade.

Terraforming Mars is one of the more thematic eurogames out there.

Mechanically it has three distinct parts:
- card-driven tableau-building, with more than 200 distinct unique cards (each with its unique artwork!)
- tile-placement where each tile position matters for final scoring
- resource-management, with lots of different - and thematically meaningful - resources

The game flows very smoothly, with a drafting phase, then players alternate in taking 1-2 actions, with a small production/upkeep at turn end.
It is very "combolicious", with players trying to perform medium/long term strategies, while adapting tactically to new cards and moves mad by the opponents.

It has some flaws, though: some may find the luck a bit too much (but I definitely love this kind of tableau-building: it reminds me a bit of Race for the Galaxy), and the graphic design could be a bit less confusing...

Anyway, Terraforming Mars is one of the best games of 2016, and perhaps one of the best around...

Initial Impression: This game is a tableau builder with a player controlled endgame trigger. The heart of the game is the large stack of cards, most of which seem to be unique. The game ramps up slowly as players set up their resource engines. 6 separate resources must be taken into account and many combinations will reap VPs. There a set collection aspect mechanism, as most cards have suits which may combo other cards. The game also includes a tile-laying mechanism which may net a player extra resources and some endgame scoring. This is a game that I enjoyed playing but am still unsure of what all the hype is about. The game doesn't bring anything new to the table but the mechanisms integrate well together.

RATING: 6
Non-drafting version feels too random for my tastes. Drafting version is better, but can play way too long. Under either variant, the combination of the basic actions and the incremental efficiency gains you receive from the cards results in a sorting exercise that doesn't justify the play time of this game. 

The card play, in my opinion, could have gone through more development. My mind keeps going to other games that implement aspects of the card play better. For example, Race for the Galaxy includes similar decisions and plays in a much shorter play time. Pax Porifiriana, Nations and Agricola, among others, are better as games where each play uses a subset of cards -- the resulting combinations are more varied in those games, and a player needs to compete against the players and the game itself, which pushes a player to stay apace of the power curve. In this game, you are given lots of options and sort through them to incrementally gain power, but its primarily happenstance if the presented options push you along its intended power curve. I think this game would have been better if the cards were split into different decks/ages, like in Through The Ages and Nations. 

Perhaps the card drafting should have been integrated more closely to the turn structure, like in Ginkgopolis. The card drafting often makes this game drag on too long. Perhaps there should have been a modification or two to lessen the playtime when certain game states/play styles are present. This game simply should not go more than 2 hours, and it often does--especially if players refuse to move up the various end-game triggering tracks. Perhaps there should have been a way to combat runaway leaders aside from the take that cards. The take that cards don't play that badly in practice, but seem out of place if compared to other player-interactive euro games (and the high number of those cards that simply destroy plants points to a band-aid in design). In the end, when you combine the average card play mechanisms, the overlong play time, the sub-par components and the amateurish card art/design, you're left with a game that, charitably, is overpriced versus competing games. 

It has a couple of positives, as its fairly accessible (true medium in weight, fairly easy to teach and understand) and it has a good theme. But the theme isn't enough to get me to play this over other games. Maybe in a couple of years they'll iterate a second edition (Terraforming Mars: A New Story of Terraforming). The concepts have so much potential and this is one of the most thematic euro-style games that I've played. But, from my point of view, the current implementation is only average. 

Edit, Nov. 2017: Played this again after staying away from it for a few months. My original opinions haven't changed for the most part. It plays too long for what it is and many, many games do aspects of its game play better. To add another to the list of games mentioned above, First Class is another that has better game play. Similar to TM, First Class throws out a bunch of engine-building options for you to sort through, but does so in a way that provides more tense and interactive decisions. First Class also plays in a fraction of the time. 

I do want to revise two things from my original opinions, though. One, the more I play it, the less thematic Terraforming Mars feels. The theme is a welcome change of pace from typical euro fare and the production shows that more effort than normal was taken to bring the theme out. The particularity of the theme and the effort to bring it out, however, distracts from the pasted-on nature of the theme. This collection of mechanisms could be easily used without much modification in another theme (e.g., building competing kingdoms, competing/warring factions in a solar system). Mars just happens to be the chosen setting for the collection of mechanisms. Second, the take that cards are a slight problem in the 2 player game. At higher play counts, the cost of the take that cards are such that playing the card is the right move only limited circumstances (e.g., to bring a clear leader back to the pack). In a 2 player game, the primary purpose of the take that cards--to combat a runaway leader--matters less in deciding whether to play the card.

I like the solo version of this game more than the multiplayer. Way too long; it feels there are 2-3 exciting turns the whole game, while the rest are just running your engine over and over. Fiddly play (moving 10s of tiny, slippery cubes on a paper-thin player mat every turn is... not great). Easy to devolve into multiplayer solitaire where everyone is heads down into their own engine. Also not a big fan of "well play it a couple times and then you can play the real game" (e.g., drafting). Probably will sell once I'm burnt out on the solo game. It's really too bad because I love the theme and homebrew aesthetic.

First impression: This game feels like Agricola to me. It isn't worker placement but you have a board position that's almost like placing workers to grab resources in Agricola, and lots of cards to help your strategy. Problem is the game is fiddlier than Agricola and also I think less deep since there is no race to grab certain face up cards. Its missing the feed your people pressure of Agricola too. Good game and great theme but not a top euro for me.

2d: Played it two players, winning again, and I like it less now. It just feels like a game about playing lots of cards, looking for combos, and littles cubes everywhere.

Fun. Its strengths:

- Solo option.
- Not too long.
- Incredible huge number of cards and corporations.
- Varied
- Tile placement production game, but better theme and better camouflaged than most other euro games.

10 solo sessions played. 5 wins/5 losses. Going for record VP is mostly a straight way to a loss. Of the last 4 played, 3 losses ...

Negative points: the recording sheets tend to shake up the resources and the 14 turns in solo play need to be noted on paper. Before you know it you tend to forget to advance the turn marker which would result in a miscalculation.

Very difficult to obtain 80+ VP if played solo correctly, meaning I don't believe one bit the so called monthly competition of this game on BGG. A pity people always want to cheat and lie on the internet or else this would be a fun solo competition.

But great game.

This was a fantastic game, both at the convention and at home. I liked the combination of deck building, resource management, and realm construction. The various options provided a lot of room for different playstyles, and that could be extremely influenced by the opening corporation you chose to play. I find myself really wanting to see how solitaire play works and eagerly awaiting a digital version. If you dig a more complex game, this is your animal.

Irgendwie kann ich den Hype um das Spiel nicht verstehen. Es dauert einfach zu lange für das, was es bietet.Freilich kann man immer etwas machen, aber es entsteht kein Mangel im Spiel und je nach Aufkommen der Karten und Entscheidungsfreude der Mitspieler kann es zäh werden wie ein Kaugummi.

RATING: 9.5
I generally abhor space-themed games for reasons I cannot fathom but this game is an exception. It's a solid thematic engine-builder that may feel like a multiplayer solitaire at times. This game grew on me with repeated plays, I think it was a decent game the first time I've tried but thoroughly enjoyed my subsequents playthrough once I'm more familiar with the concept and cards. It's essentially an Euro game, so there's subtle interactions with your opponents that I only realized later on. The game length varies depending on the players, you need to realise when to stop engine-building and focusing on points and to end the game instead. I can see this game gets even more fun with repeated plays. 

Finally I get to try drafting variant (3/9/17) with two experienced players. The game is so much better as engines are built even more efficiently and there's less luck involved. I will always play with drafting variant if possible from now onwards.

First Play: Put some effort into the rules pre-game and it seemed to pay off. Game played considerably easier than I anticipated with most down time spent considering the iconography of the cards. Soon we got into a rhythm and things purred along nicely.

Very enjoyable but it seems clear that complimentary cards can fall pat and result in very productive combos. Also there is no bash the leader per se as usually the aggressive cards won't apply to everyone. Glad I bought it and happy to play again.

I was lucky enough to get an early copy of this still hard to find game. I got to demo it at my FLGS for the month prior to it coming out...I don't think this positively skewed my opinion of the game, in face playing the same intro level game over and over for a month should have negatively impacted it. But it didn't! I really enjoy the resource management and the immense variety of cards, seriously, no repeated cards! Really enjoyed this game, one of my favorites of all time.

We tackled TFM Friday night, 3 player, me, Brian and Brett. I messed up one big rule (we allowed cards to be sold back at their cost instead of at a MC each, oops!!) which led to copious amounts of money and cards being played all over the place. We did advanced corporations, which would be the only way I would ever teach the game. I enjoyed this quite a bit as I can see the resource/point engine there in the background just waiting to come out. Unfortunately for me, I got pretty screwed over with hardly any cards drawn fitting in with my grand scheme (cities, cities and more cities). So, this moves down the rating for me just a little bit. I will probably play this again soon (definitely at Dice Tower Con 2017) with the correct rules this time and see if the tighter money game leads to more overall enjoyment for me. Rating will change based on that.

Card management game with an interesting Terraforming theme.  If you were very familiar with this game, auctioning cards would add a considerable strategic element to it.  As we have not played it enough to know the cards, we are just dealing out the cards every round making it more of a tactical game.  This is a game where one player can have a huge advantage over the course of the game depending on the cards (and card combinations) available to him/her.  The real "game" here is to make the most out of the opportunities available.  I am not sure whether my rating will improve with more plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Terraforming Mars is a great game.  It is thinky, but not overly so.  It plays quite quickly for a deep euro, once the players know how the game is played.  Most of my games these days are about an hour and a half.  

I do feel that the game does have a luck problem.  I have played games where I absolutely dominate because I drew cards to purchase that worked great with the engine that I was building.  I have played other games where I tended to draw cards that did not work with any cohesive engine.

Amazing game.  Much more fun with drafting, playing without drafting should have been the optional rule.  plays well with 2-5, and the solo mode is also fun.  Very luck based, although this hasn't kept me from loving the game so far, and drafting helps mitigate the luck.  Some of the take that cards are too powerful for their cost if played in ideal circumstances early in the game.  Typically I remove all cards with low cost that decrease an opponents production of a resource to increase yours.  Quality of the components is very low for the game's price point and it is the first game I've felt the need to buy aftermarket components for.

Played it twice now both times using the beginner corporation. I'm still on the learning curve to explore all the projects and learn more about when it's good to do a certain action, etc. The game is really nicely made and I love all the pieces. From playing point of view, it reminds me of San Juan, where you also need to ramp up your production engine and then go for the VP's in the later stage. I most likely will revise my score after playing the game more often.

Terraforming Mars is an engine building, card combo game that keeps you engaged with the decisions on timing your actions, spending your resources and playing your cards. The interaction between players is sufficient to not make it multi-player solitaire, but if card combo games are not your thing; stay away.

The terraforming theme is well integrated. The ambience of the game gives you the feeling of creating oceans, increasing the oxygen levels and lowering the temperature while maintaining the tension of accomplishing these tasks before your fellow players.

Component wise; the player boards could have been designed better as a bump in the table could send your indicators flying and ruin the stats of your progress. There are now plenty of aftermarket solutions to this problem, but these add an unforeseen cost. Still, a keeper.

It feels sort of like Race for the Galaxy with a lot of cards plus a map with tile placement and a bunch of resource management. Players are all working to raise the temperature on Mars, increase the oxygen level and add water. Like Race, you build a tableau of cards that provide benefits and symbols which can stack and unlock other options. Players draft the cards and pay for those that they keep. On the map, players build cities and plant trees and establish oceans to score points and make Mars more habitable. Replayability with this game seems strong as there are so many cards and multiple paths to victory. Players do start with a corporation card too that begins their path.

I will certainly play this more and I see it everywhere, so I have no doubt it will be easy to get into a game.

Thematically, the game is very fun and interesting. I love the sci-fi blend with actual scientific principles, I love the tiles, the cards look great and are thematic, the cubes are nice, the corporations are interesting, etc. On paper this game checks tons of boxes and is great.

In practice, the game is based WAY too heavily in luck for an engine builder. Draw bad cards, lose the game. Even with drafting. You will be able to tell who will win from Generation (the game's word for Round) 2 or 3 most of the time and then be forced to sit and watch a runaway winner enjoy gaining more and more income for 2 hours. This is really unacceptable.

Solid game with a few rough edges:
1) For a relatively long game, card draw plays too prominent a part with too few ways to mitigate by increased drawing.
2) Take-that cards are annoying -- too few to really cause chaos and none that really slow down a leader (assuming the leader, if that can even be determined, is targeted in the first place).
3) Average component quality with player boards that are thin paper and can easily be bumped, knocking the myriad of cubes around.

Going to play again with the card draft to see if that helps.

UPDATE 11/6/16: Card draw is a must -- definitely improves the game.  Still leaving it at a 7 but could rise with further plays.

I cannot shake the feeling that this game is mostly luck. I'm a fan of the mechanics in the game for the most part, but game after game some people just get a little messed over by the deck, and it makes losing and winning feel a little more hollow than other games. And its length makes that particularly frustrating. Also the design/art of the game is lackluster and sometimes feels actively disruptive.

Terraforming Mars is one of the best strategy games to come out of 2016. It's incredibly thematic, highly engaging, and somewhat interactive but not to the point of frustration. I've also found it to be incredibly balanced. In a two player game I played, my opponent got off to a much quicker start, but I overcame him halfway through and looked to be dominantly in the lead. However when we counted our scores, I had only won by 4 points in a game where we each had well over 100.

Update 5/17/2017: Bumping my rating up to a half a point after playing this game solo. It had a lot of the intensity and strategy from a normal game, but the mindset is a bit different as you are racing to get all 3 terraforming goals completed in 14 rounds. The rules recommend you gauge how you did based on your points at the end of round 14, but I found I prefer to see how few rounds I can complete the game in. It's one of the best true multiplayer game solo variants I have ever played.

I liked the feeling and the thematics of the game - at the first half of the game. It really looks like the creators invested a lot into the theme, to create a really close scientific game.
However in the second half of the game every possible problem of the game came out, and honestly I don't understand it's current position on BGG... The game was way too random and swingy for us. There are cards with which you can immediately go ahead, and cards, which at specific point of the game don't do anything. Then the game is too solitair in my opinion - everybody is checking their cards at the beginning of the game. Speechlessly, no player interaction. Then you fullfill the cards. And last - the game was way too long for us - we played it over 4 hours, and we are really experienced players, but still... Problem was that ocean giving cards didn't come up, and nobody wanted to invest in the ocean hexes, and the game just didn't want to finish...

Really cool engine building game.  A lot like race for the galaxy in that every card is unique.  For sure the hype was legit on this one, and it is one of those games people will still be playing in 5 years.  The different paths each player can take is insane... and since there are so many cards, the order in which the cards come out really seem like each game will feel different.  Love the different async corp cards as well.  I don't think 2016 was a "great" year for euro games, but this is probably the best one to come out in 2016.

Finally got a copy with the 3rd printing. My initial impressions are that the component quality complaints are a bit overblown. It isn't anything fancy, but my copy was perfectly serviceable.

I can see why people really enjoy this game. It is an excellent example of an engine builder, where the game starts very small and ramps up significantly near the end. I think it is a genius design decision to link your TR (and hence the money you earn each round) to the terraforming parameters. It naturally incentivizes players to push the game to an end and it means that turns will get bigger and bigger as the game progresses. The solo game has been very enjoyable as well. Eager to play more.

RATING: 7
There are some enjoyable mechanics here, including getting a ton of cubes at the beginning of the turn with which to buy cards, the fact that everyone is contributing to the end-game timer which is neat, and that fact that you won't see even half of the available cards in a single play, much like Agricola, and it accelerates nicely towards that end. However, it is a looong game, can feel like VP salad, the board state won't vary much game-to-game as many of the spots are pre-programmed, and the player cards don't really match the quality of the rest of the components. Maybe most disheartening was the loss of narrative throughout the game. Mainly, you will be playing cards, the cards will do something once, and then you will forget about it for the rest of the game. When you play 30+ cards in a single game, it is hard for your corporation to develop an identity which really detracts from the theme and makes it a cube-shuffling exercise. I will still play it at least a few more times for it's good traits, but would not try to sell the hobby with it.

// This is a great game - one of the few games that I'm OK
just playing and not needing to win, because it's a fun
experience either way. It's fun to watch the board change
and it's fun to decide which cards to buy, which to play
and when. Could benefit from a little more direct 
interaction between players that isn't something silly like
removing resources from them.

This has the potential to become a big hit for game nights with only 3 players. Initially I was very sceptical due to several reviews I read before finally pulling the trigger. With more plays under my belt I might like it better than Roll for the Galaxy, which scratches kind of the same itch for me. The engine building is really cool here and there seem to be various ways to victory. Player interaction is limited, but it feels like you have to keep track of the other players' plans in order to be successful - even more so with the drafting variant.

A nice medium-to-heavy euro game, with a pretty high luck factor due to random card draws. Very clear and streamlined mechanics; I'm not sure how infinitely high the replayability value is, but you'll surely get your money's worth. (Get some d20 for the incomes though, everybody agrees the standard player boards need an overlay.)

Lots of expansions on the way (Mars 2, Venus, Jupiter), we'll see if that will work. At some point, just printing new maps will degenerate into "why didn't you have a flexible map a la FCM or Clash of Cultures".

Doesn't live up to the hype. The cards/drafting are way too random to call it a strategy game. If you happen to see the cards that line up with your corporation, great. If not, you'll lose. The advanced cards make for some wonderful combos, but because there are that many more cards, it's that much worse.

Very good game, very interesting, well executed theme, overall very solid euro type game. But... player boards are just unacceptable - very thin like normal sheet of paper ready to go to the printer, very slippery which is not helping when You have to use those plastic cubes to mark how many resources You have. Once You touch the table everything You have marked move and the whole game is done. What a shame.

RATING: N/A
I can see why Terraforming Mars is popular. As an engine builder, it allows players to create a suggestive display of originality. Furthermore, all of this is done within a theme that is quite relevant today. Despite being a Euro, there are moments in which Terraforming Mars feels cooperative because of the general direction that players are taking together. Nobody stands up and says, "Hey, we all settled on the island of Catan together," but terraforming a planet evokes a sense of pride around the table.  

Sadly, its not a very good two-player game: sometimes the four-card draw tends to play itself and it can potentially be a pretty uneventful 2 hours especially when the table interaction is low and the terraform rating track is constantly reminding you that you are losing and there is nothing you can do about it.

RATING: 9
This game is very well designed and balanced "engine builder", where your heat, energy, plant and other resource generating capacity slowly but steadily increases, allowing you to complete the overriding group goal of "Terraforming Mars".

Game play consists of players spending their wealth on events (asteroid impacts), buildings (ore mines) and capabilities (improved heat generation) that take the form of cards that are drawn from a random deck. The deck is generally larger than needed for a single play through, so each game played may have a slightly different feel, or difficulty, as some cards are unavailable through different play through sessions.

Once the planet has been "fully terraformed", the winner is determined by essentially figuring out who contributed the most during the whole process. There are points available by activating (via purchase) milestones [mid game achievements] and awards [end game comparisons], and various buildings and events earn small amounts of points along the way. In addition, cities score points for each vegetation sector that neighbors it, and vegetation sectors are also worth a single point each.

This game supports a single player variant, which plays very much like the multiplayer version, but is more of a race against the clock, as you have only so many generations (14) to complete the terraforming of the planet. A score is calculated, which can be used to compare your performances between solo runs of the game.  The ability to win, in solo play, is mostly a factor of what cards become available during the game; Experience, however, makes it easier to win, no matter what, as you become more comfortable and efficient at creating the best terraforming engine possible.

Terraforming Mars! Just what the box says. What a great theme! I developed my love of reading from Asimov, Heinlein, and Bradbury, and speculation about what we will find, or develop, on Mars figured largely in their works. This game relates totally to my long standing love affair with the mysterious Red Planet! 

Card/action selection to build a terraforming engine better than your opponents, yet at the same time you are cooperating to make Mars survivable. Recognizable traces of Race For the Galaxy here, but based more firmly on science or believable extrapolations of scientific theory. What an extensive job of research went into the mechanics in this game.

Watching the run-throughs and finally playing my first game confirmed my enthusiasm for this game. It is a bit random in the card drawing which can be devastating or extremely helpful in the early going.so I expect to explore some drafting variants.. But so far, a definite keeper!

Es un juego de cartas, a pesar de que existe un tablero central y cada jugador tiene su propio tablero. TODO son las cartas. Cada jugador, usa su tablero para almacenar recursos y controlar los niveles deproducción de las materias (dinero, acero, titanio, plantas, energía y calor).
Cada turno (generación), consiste en recibir unas cartas y decidir si te quedas con ellas (pagando 3 por cada una) y después se suceden las rondas de juego. En cada ronda, cada jugador puede hacer una o dos acciones, o pasar. Una vez que pasa queda fuera.

Al final hay una fase de producción y comienza una nueva generación. El juego continua hasta que se consigue terraformar marte, elevando los parámetros fundamentales (se construyen todos los océnamos, se sube el nivel de oxígeno a 14 y la temperatura a 8ºC).

Es un juego de hacer combos y están muy bien pensadas las cartas (trae muchísimas, más de 200). Además, cada jugador juega con una de muchas corporaciones posibles, lo que da rejugabilidad. 

Muy absorvente. Una delicia para jugones. Para no jugones lo veo dificil, porque hay mucho símbolo, y muchos parámetros que dependen a su vez de otros, y puede hacer pensar bastante.

At the outset I want to make a few philosophical comments based on reviewing previously written comments and criticisms of this game.  This is the second time I have written a review of any game on this site.  Having read reviews about this game reinforces my opinion on just how fickle human nature is.  Some reviewers have ascribed 3's and 4's and 5's based on "randomness," "chance based," "asymmetry" - to exclude the element of "luck" is to remove 50% of what life experience on planet Earth (or Mars, or anywhere in the known universe for that matter) is all about.  Fundamentally our very existence as individuals (just the biochemistry of it all), as a species, this planet itself, the fate of this planet, the potential for us to make another planet habitable, have as much to do with Divine Providence (yes even the writers of the US constitution included this language) as it does with strategic planning.  Terraforming Mars is a game where one must make the most of what the chaos of the universe has offered them.  
Secondly, other reviewers have criticized this game for providing nothing "Novel," of generating a mechanic that "will fade in a month or two on the Hotness scale once another game comes out" - these comments reflect the intellectual depth of the people who authored them.  At the risk of discrediting myself and to emphasize what I'm about to say - in one specific important dimension this game rivals Twilight Struggle, Dominant Species, or any other of the like - it has great authenticity - the mechanic of the game has an impact the matches the theme of the game.  Great educational value.  For example, when a player raises the Temperature to 0 degrees Celsius, they have the added bonus of creating a lake (given that frozen water within the soil will now melt and collect in low topographical points) which also triggers economical boosts to the Corporation that accomplished that - in other words affecting one metric in the ecosystem has Newtonian impact on other metrics.  Great from an educational perspective, wonderful portrayal of the interconnectesness of human actions on the environment. of the interconnectedness of temperature, oxygen, plant life, water abundance.  Twilight Struggle and Dominant Species also do a supreme job of matching game mechanic to their respective themes also.  
Third, other reviewers have criticized it for its theme.  Irrespective of whether a person likes space themed games or not, in order for a legitamite ruling of how well a game helps its players detach from the day to day and lose a sense of space and time getting "lost" in the experience and ultimately start daydreaming in the moment - Terraforming Mars does a stellar job of accomplishing just that - it is a space/economic/survival themed game and everyone of we five people who have played the game agreed that the game designers excelled in this department.  And as an aside to those nay sayers of space themed games - BEWARE THE UNCURIOUS.  In fact to be Human is also to wonder about the Heavens above and what lies beyond our green planet.  I am grateful to the game designers for generating such a power packed game that may be played in a reasonable time of two hours.  This game gets my Essen Vote for sure - certainly over Scythe or any of the other contenders

Awesome, and the best game of Gen Con 2016 for me. Fantastic theme that ties everything together, a myriad of possible engine-building combinations given the 100s of unique cards, and excellent player interaction. Four-player game with all new players took maybe 2.5 hours, although it felt like the meat of a 4+ hour game. Also, relatively streamlined so things didn't bog down into a point salad. 

Can't wait to get multiple plays of this under my belt; I can see the score rising soon.

10/29: bumped to 9.5

Possibly my favourite euro. Theme is captured in a fantastic way. There is a lot of science in this game, but the mechanics are simple and fast. The game takes some time (for a euro), wich I like.

One of my favorite games right now. Quick playing but a lot to think about. Some luck of draw but luck is a part of almost every game. Don't overlook some cards just because you are playing a certain style. Whether it is a 4 player game or the solo variant it is a great challenge.

This was a good one with lots of things I would normally like in a game but something felt a little off. It was a little too long for what it was. While I'm sure more plays would get the time down I just didn't feel like I would be getting anything new or different by buying it.

Seasons and Race for the Galaxy give me a similar feel for a fraction of the time commitment and I just don't think the experience Terraforming Mars creates justifies the extra time and amount of money I would spend on it (especially with such poor components).

I will gladly play it again but don't see myself buying it or seeking it out anytime soon.

Race for the Galaxy on a map. 

My favorite game of 2016. I love both the board play and the drafting mechanism. Games in my group are usually long (around the 3-hour mark), but time always flies whenever we play. One of the most played games at the club this year.

M̶o̶r̶e̶ ̶d̶a̶t̶a̶ ̶r̶e̶q̶u̶i̶r̶e̶d̶.̶ I think I love this... but I also feel a bit like I could not play it again. Then I think hard and I realize "No, I have to play this again." I think that it's just hard to keep track of everything that's going on in this game. In the end though nobody minds as it was just such a fun card slinging time. And I'm sure that it's way deeper than my first fumbling play revealed. Want to try with drafting.

EDIT: Still no drafting experience (my friend who own's it is VERY reluctant to experiment with his game experience), but honestly this keeps getting better every time I play. I never win, but who cares about that? The feeling you get from constructing your corporations machine is unmatched by any engine builder that I've played. It can get a bit AP heavy towards the last act of the game, but even so everyone is in the same boat so it never feels like the game really slows down. I remarkable race that manages to make you really REALLY care about the journey, and not just the end. A remarkable game.

The definition of multiplayer solitaire. You are in your own little world playing card combos with very little interaction to what any one else is doing with their card combos.

After only 1 play I can see the attraction - many MANY! cards leading to multiple paths to victory. Card management is key because if you don't get what you want you better scramble to go to plan B. Great components (although the player mats could have been just a little thicker please). A little tough to get through the first time - once you've played it it's straight forward.

After 2 plays: I am knocking it down a 1/2 point. IF you don't get any 'green' cards (plants/animals) I think it is hard to win. Just saying.....

Played for the first time tonight at Play More Games.  I lucked into a very strong Plant strategy and won.

Played a second time and dominated with a Jovian strategy.  I think I'd like to try a game with drafting to see how that works.

I think overall that this game, despite some "take that" feature, is still mostly multi-player solitaire.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
The game itself is very engaging and fun. I like the sheer number of cards and options within the game. It appears that there is a lot of replay-ability built in. Having the ability to start off with easy corporations, then adding in corporations that have their own abilities, and then adding the Corporate Era cards in later games makes for a nice way to start off learning the game and then 'expand' the game when you become more familiar.

I reduced the rating due to the quality of the components. The player mats and cardstock are very thin. The box insert is also thin. The sides that are supposed to hold the board above the other components was ripped even though the box itself shows no damage. Fortunately, all of the components for the game were not damaged. 

The resource management is very fiddly when using the resource allocation cubes. They can very easily be knocked out of position. If you are not constantly making sure you know exactly how much of each resource you are generating, or the number of resources you currently own, one bump of the table can mess up your entire game.

De todo lo que he probado mi favorito del año 2016, sin duda, me encanta el rollo de ir mirando cartas, intentar buscar sinergías, aprovechar hasta el último recurso para conseguir ese recurso que podrás usar en tu próximo turno. Unido a que es bastante fluido por que las acciones se van ejecutando de dos en dos como máximo, hace que las 3 horas o más que dura el juego (con una hora menos de duración sería perfecto) no se hagan excesivamente largas. Respecto a la queja de la gente respecto a los componentes, bueno, no son los mejores del mundo pero no alteran tu experiencia de juego así que, es un mal menor. Con ganas de seguir jugándolo a ver si consigo ganar una partida.

Terraforming Mars seems to be one of the hottest games out there right now. Honestly I don't think it deserves it. From below average components to gameplay that encourages players to not advance the game, this just fell flat for me. I'll give it another chance before it makes it onto the junk pile.

I've played with 2, 4, and 5 players so I have no doubt that it's fun with three players as well. This is my favorite game that has come out this year (2016). The Corporate deck doesn't add too much more length to the five player game but it really makes the two player game a lot longer.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
There are so many reasons I shouldn't like Terraforming Mars. It is essentially an economic snowball game where the rich get richer, and since the ability to get richer hinges on... card draws, ahem, already we are treading on thin ice. There is very little chrome to the game. It is simply draw cards, buy them, play them, maybe buy things, repeat ad infiniutm. In this, the game hearkens back to titles of yore, almost mass market in its concepts and execution (cult favorite SolarQuest comes to mind).

I can understand why people might dislike this game. And yet... it fascinates me. It is addictive as hell. It is intense, and immersive. I can't see a day when I wouldn't want to play it. Card luck can be significant, especially with fewer players, so I do recommend always using the draft (a definite with two). This is the poster child for a game that is more than the sum of its parts. Love it or hate it, it is indelible.

Really great card-driven game that does a nice job of "simulating" terraforming the planet. Decisions are interesting and competition can be fierce over board spaces and scoring goals. The player powers are just different enough to make each game feel a little different, but seem really balanced. 

A few things I don't like about the game: it's a little too easy to get stuff, and there are almost too many cards drawn and played every turn, such that by the end of the game I feel my player area is a total, incomprehensible mess of cards. The game is also very fiddly in the sheer number of resources you get: I wish the economy were a little more limited and the number of cards you can draw had been reduced (maybe something more along the line of Seasons). As it is, the game feels like you're winning the lottery every turn. Which is still fun, but it makes it a little too easy to do whatever you want.

4/1/17: A tableau building game with a board element that somewhat reminds of RftG and took me several plays to warm up to.
  
The game play itself is compelling,  but the major drawbacks for me are that the games tend to be really long(3 to 3.5hrs and probably due to the multiple card effects that can accumulate per player during the game), and the system incorporates a potentially problematic drafting mechanism that can leave you in no-mans land strategy wise if the right cards don't come out.  

When you add in that plus sub-par components(flimsy cards and thin cardboard whenever and wherever possible),  head scratching design decisions(who thought that those cubes for tracking money and resources was a good idea!) and it's STILL a good gaming experience?  

You sir, have a hit on your hands. (7.75)

My first game I won easily against players that already knew how to play. I got the rules and mechanics pretty well but didn't feel like I had fun playing it. I had the opportunity to play again and wanted to understand why is this game so popular. But during halfway through the game I just wanted to accelerate the game so it could finish earlier. Also the graphic design and pictures on the cards are not very good. I don't think I want to play it again.

I see a number of comparisons of Race for the Galaxy and Terraforming Mars; not to state the obvious, but Race for the Galaxy is a similar but clearly far superior game. But, you can't play Race *all* the time, and there are people in the world who for whatever misguided reason like Terraforming Mars but not Race :) Race also has the problem of punishing experience differentials pretty hard, and differentials are pretty easy to rack up, so that's sometimes not great. Still, as I say below, I think it's pretty clear Terraforming Mars isn't a long-term winner (unless the expansions really bring it in an unexpected way), even if it's a fine game-of-the-moment.
---
Docking the rating a point as the inevitable replayablity endpoint encroaches. I'm at 10 plays and it's getting pretty samey as it's clear there are a limited number of paths through the game. The Corporate Era may have better balance and be more interesting, but the once I played it just outstayed its welcome considerably. Still, will try that again, see if it gives the game some more life. 10 plays is not bad, but not enough to rate it an 8 on my scale :)
---
I haven't been super-impressed by the Corporate game. It adds length, the balance doesn't feel that great, and it adds a bunch of dead-end options (the game is still basically won or lost on greenery and/or cities, the corporate game just adds a bunch of stuff you can do that seems unwise). Because of the super-restricted start on the corporate game, there will sometimes be a point - often well over an hour before the game is actually over - when you know you just don't have the economy to be competitive but your kinda stuck watching the other players do cool stuff while you sit and struggle (Agricola has kinda the same issue - usually you know about 45 minutes from the end or so whose in it to win it and who'se just a spectator at that point).

Anyway, still enjoying it and this will probably easily hit 10-15 plays (unless I end up disliking the corporate game when that's the version everyone else wants to play), which is pretty great. But like Agricola, there is clearly a hard endpoint to the replayability.
---
I'm always a little surprised when the new hotness actually turns out to be something I like, but I've enjoyed Terraforming Mars quite a bit. They've put some effort into breathing life into the setting. The card deck seems pretty well balanced, and you'll see enough cards over the length of the game for some synergies to fall out. At 6-7 turns, the length is sensible, and it has a nice arc - a fairly long period of buildup followed by a flurry of action in the last two turns.

Top play tips: You need some points from the goals and awards to win. Pay for the standard projects to lock these in if you need to; they are a bunch of points. Don't let your corporation cause you to over-focus; none of the corporation powers are super-strong so don't let them blind you to other combos. With the game being as short as it is, turn-wise, don't neglect the option to stand pat for a turn and see what the next project draw brings. It's certainly not a power play, but if you're in a tricky spot and really just need more info, sometimes it can be better to punt.

Like Core Worlds, Terraforming Mars plays 5 but it makes the downtime a little tough, or even punishing in the wrong groups. Stick to 3-4 by preference.

The game this reminds me most of is actually Agricola. They're not very similar mechanically, but they both have the feel of playing the hand of cards you've been dealt and looking for efficiencies and synergies. Like Agricola, the interest of the game space is bounded by how often the card mix you see interests or surprises you. So I suspect this won't have a ton of long-term replayability (although I haven't played the full corporation game yet). But I suspect it has a while to go yet before I get bored of it :)

RATING: 10
My 7th 10 rating of all time out of about 1,500 total games played! 

I'm a fan of games where you get a selection of cards, and you make the best of what you get, trying to form some sort of engine out of them. This game has it in spades, with a huge number of cards, all of them unique! You're building cities, fostering wildlife, forming seas, founding corporation, starting energy plants, and a ton of other stuff, which all give you various resources and advantages.

As experienced gamers, we just went straight into the full deck of cards, which we really enjoyed. The recommendation for new players is to remove a bunch of cards which seem to have more of an economic/business focus, but I really thought they were interesting would always play with them, even though they make the game a bit longer.

I also really enjoyed that, while I was building an engine, my focus was able to change throughout the game due to all of the things going on. One engine got me to a certain point, at which point another engine became useful, and so on. So, it wasn't an engine building game where you got things up and running and then ran on auto-pilot. You could still find new twists and turns to explore, even as the game neared the end.

Overall, just a really cool game, and I really look forward to more of it!

Regarding the component quality, I've seen complaints, but I really don't get what the concern is. I thought everything was very nice. Yes, the player mats are card stock, but they just sit on the table in front of you and you never move them. Everything was of a quality I'd expect of a modern board game, so no complaints here, and any complaints you see are likely overblown.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A nice game with a great theme, although I suspect the rating here on BGG is a bit overrated.  I haven't yet tried the specialized corporations or drafting variant which i feel would improve my rating as it might improve strategy and reduce the sense of random card draw that can stiffle early game play.  The tactical side of game play, turn order, and action selection really comes out as players move closer to achieving milestones and awards.

Great game, may be a bit of luck of the draw? EDIT After second game : good but  a bit lengthy, and you are a bit too much driven by the draw may be? If you don't draw cities you don't build cities... Actually your engine is very driven by the draw,it seems. Need to test the draft and faster players.

Really neat engine builder about making Mars hospitable. The theme is interesting and definitely well integrated. I love the asymmetrical starting resources and bonuses based on your corporation. Combined with the large deck of all unique cards it makes for awesome variability from game to game. The downside of the unique cards is that luck comes into play: some players may get the one card that give an awesome reward while others may never have that chance. Looking forward to trying it again!

Split on this one as I think it really is a good engine builder with a semblance of theme, but for the length and commitment I'd rather play Scythe which features interaction and conflict. If I want a similar feel of engine building but a shorter game than Scythe, bring on Race for the Galaxy. That leaves Terraforming Mars awkwardly alone on the dance floor.

RATING: 9.6
Also had play-testing version from Europe. Eagerly awaiting publication of first commercial version.
A slightly lighter version of a Mars-terraforming specific High Frontier and definitely "hard sci-fi." Addresses lack of seriously plausible radiation shielding as well as possible to still allow for all the other terraforming technologies. Take-that features somewhat counter thematic.

What an amazing game.  I had heard the hype, and seen a lot of tweeted pictures, so was excited about getting a chance to play to see what they hype was about.  The hype is real, and this is a really tremendous experience.  We refreshed and learnt the rules pretty quickly, but still managed to miss a couple of things (you can do 2 actions on your turn, and this is important) and I missed some stuff about making money from building next to water.  This didn't matter to the overall play of the game, because I think the game is pretty intuitive, and we did our best to let people fix their misunderstandings, and we caught it quickly.

The game is intuitive and the players boards tell you all you need, even if they can slip a little... only one person knocked their board, and knew how to reset it anyways.  I can see where there is the chance for luck in this game, or someone knowing the super crazy combos, but I think there is enough going on, even for new players, that you can grab your own luck and build up your engine.  I want so much more of this game.  Tremendous.

Based on 1 play with 5 players:

It's like someone made Race for the Galaxy into a full-length Eurogame. And hey, it works! The engine building feels great and comfortingly familiar. There's some minor racing/blocking aspects to the board, which work really well.

But I do have one problem: this is a 2 hour strategy game where you can get fucked by luck of the draw. The game is exceptionally balanced so players are unlikely to run away with the lead, but you can find yourself in a position where you don't see any resource generation cards until late in the game. There's several things that could solve this - having ways to cycle cards, drafting, or a tiered card system like 7 Wonders - and it's a pity that the game doesn't address it.

With that, this is a very good game that I'm pretty happy to play whenever offered. But I'm unlikely to personally suggest it over my favorite meatier Euros.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I played incredible amounts of board games and online strategy games, but this one of the top games I have played so far. The balancing is outstanding even with incredible card diversity, theme and overall scientific accuracy is a big bonus, and I love the fact that no matter how bad your draw is there is always a way to win with standard projects, awards, and milestones. Amazing game of card analysis, deck building, psychology, resource management, timing, and situational awareness. Sensational game

RATING: 9
I was expecting a really good game. Exceeded my expectations 100 fold.

This reminded me of Race for the Galaxy in some ways with card synergy. This is probably going to be a top 10 game of all time for me...just need to get more plays in to confirm.

The Meeple Realty insert is pretty much a necessity with this game.

Component issue side note: I do think the publisher should have made the paper player boards cardboard with cut outs for the cubes with as much use as they get AND how significant they are to the gameplay (a bump could ruin a game!). I think anyone whom plays this game would have paid more for something like that. While it doesn't sour the game, it could sour A game. It is frustrating to do this with a "gamer's" game.

Also, the cubes paint chips. Even after 1 play. They feel great, but what are these going to look like after 10 plays? I'll probably have to end up re-painting them and resealing them myself, or buying upgraded components. 

I do appreciate this game is made in my backyard (Lafayette, IN), but the selection of paper player boards and quality of the cubes still needs to be corrected.

So unless you are patient enough to constantly explain everyone else is cards to them, you might get bored. I wish the cards were simpler and had better directions on them.

Solid game. I like that there will be a lot of variety game to game based on how the cards come out. The cards drive strategy much more than a game like Agricola for example. Requires flexibility which I always like. 

Not a lot of interaction in the game though. Everyone is sort of working their own engine. They throw in a couple of screwage cards to simulate interaction, but it's cheap. Racing for certain things is about as far as that goes. But a new fresh puzzle to work out every game.

This game is FANTASTIC!  Tableau based engine building, resource management, board and area control, and lots of other things that you want to explore and exploit in a game.  So much replayability that this games needs to hit the table all the time, whenever an opportunity arrives.

The only thing lacking is the player interaction on a larger scale.  I guess there can be some "take that" with the placement of a tile or the play of a Red Card that can affect your opponent, but it does have a flavor of "multiplayer solitaire", which can be a symptom of some engine-building types of games.  But I can look past that, as I think this is a gem to enjoy for a long time.

An engine building game where you incrementally build up your power with a steady influx of cards. The three shared tracks that all players are working to complete while also nabbing the most points make this one great.  Every round you get more cards and picking them up to see how the new possibilities could fit into your engine is great amounts of fun. Add in some cool board position elements and a couple objectives to race for and it just gets better. I'm  looking forward to more plays and also trying the draft variant.

It's a decent game. But it's very solatire. Interestingly I played this right before the suds top 100 and Paul's comment perfectly summarise my thoughts:
'Terraforming player interaction, more like. Or the lack of. This is a game absolutely packed with cute little systems, clever mechanical interactions and so many cubes and cards. But it also didn’t have nearly enough going on that had me actively engaging with other players, its lack of any tension failed to whet my appetite and some of the presentation was wildly variable. I enjoyed watching Mars develop, but came away feeling lukewarm rather than hankering for more'

I was eager to try this and finally got a chance to play a 2p game. It took us 2 hours which was what it expected, but it seemed to move quickly and I enjoyed it throughout. The project cards are great and offer a variety of strategies even without drafting them and the fact they are all unique is great. It was a little solitary and a fair amount of thinking when you get your 4 cards each round about what to keep and what to buy otherwise it was great to see the game progress and your engine get better and more powerful. In the early generations we were passing after 1 or 2 turns, but towards the end we were taking 4+ turns. This one is definitely a keeper for me and I hope to be able to play it more soon.

Es un juego espectacular, de partidas largas pero ni se nota eso en mesa porque es inmersivo, da múltiples combinaciones de estrategias, poquísimo azar (salvo el de hacer draf o la misma repartición de proyectos) y la temática es espectacular. Me enamoré desde la primera partida, altamente recomendable.

Really nice engine building game. Thought it was too long after my first play, but more plays helped speed things along. I can see that drafting would help actually accomplish a strategy, but still not sure I want to play with drafting. Seems like it's going to add too much time to the game.

Gameplay is ok. Card system is very random.

Component quality really makes no sense in a game that retails for $70. Horrible player mats and generic photos for art is really disappointing. Flimsy box I can get over and the rest of the components are fine.

I strongly dislike the price to quality you get in the box.

On the plus side, there's certainly a crunchy strategic underpinning to the game, so if that's all you require to enjoy a game, you may like this. But that's pretty much where the positives end for me. "Terraforming Mars" is as dry as Martian dirt. It's just numbers soup. So many numbers! My credit production is 49! My heat production is 17! My energy is 12! What's it all mean? CUBES! A multitude of cubes coming and going off your playmat - a non-recessed playmat, mind you, meaning one slight bump and you'll have lost any official record as to your production values. Meanwhile, your tableau is growing. Great! Only it won't stop growing, leading to multi-minute turns which end with you begging your fellow players to allow you some extra power you'd forgotten you possess because the associated card had gotten lost in the shuffle. Games can thus drag on and on, making the whole affair fairly wearying. That the game board starts ugly and really doesn't get much prettier despite the additions of ocean and greenery tiles doesn't help.

"Terraforming Mars" is an admirable game. It's a crunchy game. But it's not a particularly fun game, and you never really feel its admirable theme. There are few games I would flat out avoid playing again. This might be one of those few.

When my friend opened his copy we shared our despair at the quality of the player boards and laughed at the random stock photo in the rule book (am I a winner?). Going into the game he was suspicious but afterwards his only comment was "oh man, we HAVE to play that again". Its only an 8 rather than a 9.5 because of the player board quality, card art and layout of rule book.

One of my favourite games. Perfectly designed, very well balanced, with loads of cards adding variety and player asymmetry to guarantee different players try different strategies. It may get a bit too long with 4 or 5 players, but overall is a game very very close to perfection. 

The solo game is a very different experience than that of multiplayer, but it's my favourite solo game for a reason. It's simple, but it forces you to think and adapt so that you can win the game. It's very very good.

This game is well designed and I LOVE the theme. The wife loves it and we play it here and there 2 player. However, not enough interaction for me to rate any higher. Too often the interaction comes as take that with no way to negate which is the worse kind. Will keep around as my one economic engine builder (besides Scythe) for us two to play. Can't imagine wasting a session of 4-5 with this instead of something with higher interaction though.

Update: I do enjoy this one the more we play it. Still haven't played with more than 2 though. Have to be in the mood for a less interactive experience. Wouldn't actually mind trying with 3 when we don't want to fight each other in other games.

What in the world is all the hype about? This continues the sad trend of, "for the life of me, I can't figure out how some of these games are cracking the top 100, let alone the top 10". In particular I don't understand the adoration for games with zillions of cards that do random crap., especially when players have their own hands. There is very little opportunity to play other players. You're almost entirely playing against the game, with lots of incidental player contact, and even attack, but the worst kind, where it's just "choose another player to hose". I thought we evolved from that like around year 2000.

RATING: 9
Great engine building game with some player interaction through tile placement and use of (optional) Corporate Era cards. Card draw can stymie players which may be overcome with the drafting variant but I am yet to play it due to concerns on additional game time. Some familiarity with the cards is helpful particularly in early game so that you don't either over extend or miss out on synergies. The quality of player mats is not great - it would have been awesome to have a thick one with cut outs like Scythe (I have made do by laminating player mats and using player coloured D10s to track resources).

Very preliminary thoughts after two plays, both with three players. The game definitely held our interest for two back to back plays. Not sure when the last time that occurred with a game like this. The first game was with basic corporations and the second with the advanced corporations. There was a myriad of choices and decision points keeping the turns tense and interesting. More thoughts to come.

Once upon a time... there was the Snowball Engine. And gamers all around the world gazed in wonder upon the Snowball Engine, and saw that it was good. They proclaimed it Strategic. Tactical. The harbringer of world peace. 

And this day and age—2017'ish—the Snowball Engine is still very much alive and kicking. Witness this design which is almost pure Snowball. It contains five or six currencies you can mix and combine... but don't assume you'll be going anywhere anytime soon. The first hour of the game is spent doing almost nothing. You don't have the money, and you don't have the resources. Cards don't seem to [i]get[/i] you anywhere. Then, in the second hour, near the end, something seems to happen. And then you're done. The pacing is mind-numbingly glacial; and you suddenly realise you've spent the vast majority of your game time reading cards and pushing cubes around.

Surely you can [i]plan[/i] for something? Well... no. Cards are drafted, then passed around 7 Wonders / Notre Dame / Ginkgopolis-style, presumably to make it appear the game has a strategic streak. Such an approach may work in a game lasting 30 minutes. It is completely bonkers in a game lasting 120. It just goes to show that people don't really want complex interaction patterns. They want excessive sameness, for hours on end. Oh yes, there are cards which allow you to peek at the deck for a little foreknowledge. If you obtain them. 

Basically, I can't really imagine why people would want to play this with the solid Race for the Galaxy around the corner. It's the same principle, but taking only 20 instead of 120 minutes. In short, Terraforming Mars was never my type of game, and never will be either.

It's a fun game to play and I love that you're working together to achieve something while still in competition with each other! My only issue with it is that sometimes the game goes on a round or two longer than you'd want, especially if you have slow players in your group. I'm hoping the venus next expansion fixes that with the solar phase and am looking forward to adding it on my next play.

Good game, pretty complex so it requires quite few plays to master, player sheets design is poor though,  hard to keep these little cubes on the spots,  pins would definitely work better, I loved the M€ cubes,  Mars itself has pretty good finishing, cards as well. There is very little interaction between players though.

I don't understand the buzz. Seemed like an ok and overly long engine builder.  I love engine builders, but when you get a special power AND draw ten cards at the beginning of the game and feel like not single pair of things have any real interesting synergies, seems kinda meh. Most of the cards just give you stuff and maybe some more income of one of the 6 resources.  If you get certain things you can get some end game goals.  If you get other stuff you get immediate points.  The theme is great and well done.  But I am sad to say this was boring and underwhelming compared with the hype.

Really enjoy TM. It has a neat theme and the sense of building something.  It feels different with multiple player counts and offers a lot of replayability due to the potential entropy of the card draw.  Knowing the flow of the game and when to go for which resources will also help players mitigate randomness and hold vs. pass on certain cards.  The components could be better. When playing multiplayer, having the 1st player token receiver bump one key indicator of their choice (no scoring) helps to speed the game up nicely.

I've now played about ten bouts of this game. I still hunger to play it more so thumbs up from me.

I like the graphic design, I like the mechanics and the drafting mechanism is fun and makes you pay attention to your neighbour's decks. The only minus is that the cubes are so slippery that they easily move from their positions on the resource tracks on player sheets. It would really help to have punched player boards.

It's a good game. It has some downtime issues when playing with 5. Also, even with the draft, you are kind of still at the mercy of the card draw. 

However, of the two TM's this is not the one to keep.

RATING: 9
Simple to set up, learn and play. Complex in the considerations and strategy. A player is free to pursue their interests and not be forced into a style of play in order to win that being said it is best to avail one's self of the opportunities that present themselves early. Establishing a good production base early, not over investing in long range patents, and the establishment of only a few areas of focus seem to be solid strategies. The game seems to start slow but the game accelerates and concludes in a parabolic curve at the end. Every patent card is extreamly cool. Drawbacks; cube control (easily jostled). Thin player mat. (minor issue)

Birthday gift for my oldest son's 13th. He loves the movies "The Martian" and "Interstellar". Surprised that my 10 year old grasped the game quickly. I just help him through the details after he first reads the card. Both boys, and me, thoroughly enjoy playing.

High marks for production quality, artwork, theme, the variety of cards to play, and the number of things going on the board without the game being beyond the grasp of a bright 10 year old. I also like the huge variety of strategies / courses of action available. No two plays are alike.

Addition: I strongly disagree with the negative reviews I have read on this game. My top criteria for Euro games like this are:

1. Do my kids enjoy playing it?
2. Do I enjoy playing it with them?

Considering that my 13 year old son adores, and I mean ADORES, playing this game, while my 10 year old is nearly as enthusiastic about it, and I really enjoy it....what more is there to say? The reviews are over-analyzing negatives. The game is fun for all ages....over and over again. That makes it a home run, period.

RATING: 8
TL;DR: Terraforming Mars game mechanics are exceptional but it desperately needs a second edition to do a complete art design overhaul, new playmates (similar to Scythe), rules/guidebook re-write, and improve overall quality of the product.

The biggest issue I have with the game is that the art design is really bad, it’s as if the game designer had provisioned multiple artists and had a deadline of 2 weeks. I’m serious AF when I say this. I thought the design was intentional , i.e. retro cheesy science mix, but after our first game I noticed a lot of layout errors that would be caught during review. If you have TM a good example of this is the margin spacing on the instructional cards (which is inconsistent between cards and left/right of some cards).

Speaking of instructions — I want to applaud the person that can read the guide and fully understand how the game works without any help (YouTube or friends). The guidebook needs a re-write with an easier way to reference common mechanics of the game.

It just seems to me that the overall quality wasn’t a priority for the release, almost as if this was a beta testers edition to test the mechanics.

The playmates (and the cards) are fairly low quality glossy paper, and any slight bump of the table or the playmates you’ll be asking to yourself “where were these cubes exactly?”. It’s no wonder I see a lot of alternative playmates for TM.

Again, the vibe of Terraforming Mars is a beta release stands out as soon as you open the box. Everything is simply thrown in baggies, there are no dividers. With this game having tons of cards the expectation is at least a card tray in the box. It’s no wonder (again) there are a lot of organizers for TM.

I know, I know, this is all superficial and that’s why with all these quality issues I still see it being an excellent game. One that I highly recommend playing.

I’d recommend when playing drafting process for selecting project cards, it’s going to add some time but it will prevent the game from titling in a players direction based on a random draw. That said it has a trade-off of extending the game time, especially if you have slower players, so ‍♂️

After playing for a bit you will notice how well thought out everything is; which allows for you as a player to be fully engrossed in terraforming mars.

I was considering for a long time whether to get this game as I felt the theme is not my thing. Fortunately Czech version was released and it meant as usual that my interest grew.
And it was great decision. The game became one of my favorites shortly. I have never been into the new game before. It almost feels it is taylored just for me. Also it is great both as solo and multiplayer mode (some games can be played solo, but for sake of loosing some appeal - but this is not the case).

What I like:
- Card draft. I like drafting a lot (see MtG), and there is an awesome draft mechanism - it is just optional, but I would always play it this way (there are some exceptions, for example when teaching the game to the new gamer). It is so cool to pick what you need or deciding to "hatedraft" what your opponent really needs.
- paying for cards you actually want to own and play later. Wow this adds a lot. I would say this is one of the cores of the game and one of the reasons why the game is so successful. You simply need to decide whether you need this card so you will pay 3$ for it or it would be better for you to save the tight sources for some other cards or for actually building something. Clever, very clever.
- I like the engine building implemented there. You started as a weak corporation but you become more and more powerful with more abilities. First few rounds are usually very short as you can do only few actions, but later in the game the action's decision tree grows a lot.
- Each corporation demands a bit different play style, some are more specialized, some are more open, but all are more or less balanced (for multiplayer games).
- Cards. There are plenty of cards. With variable effect and power. This adds a bit of luck to the games as you can pick a great card for you or not. I believe this is good, I like having some sort of luck in my games.

What I dislike:
- Player boards. They are awful. I would accept that they use unappealing font and the graphics is not so nice, but the cardboard is so thin. It is just a piece of paper. and storing all the cubes in the game on it? painful. Hopefully nobody would move with a table because it this case you would lost every track of your progress. Bad.
- Sometimes you feel you just move cubes here and back. A lot of cubes. And all the time. This is so annoying especially when you use some resource repetitively each generation and in produce phase you need to take them back. This is not cool.

Other than that, I don't have any gripe with the production quality of the game - the board is nice and it shows everything you need to know in a game, the resource cubes are nice. Just made player boards similar as in Scythe and it will be great.

Just ordered this game two days ago. Waiting for it to ship. Looking forward to checking it out. The theme and the engine building aspects really appealed to me. 

Update: The components in my game are pretty outstanding compared to all of the negative things I've heard. Instead of the flat, really thin, glossy paper mat, I have a mounted board. The player cards are not as thin as I have heard described. And the colorful pieces look great, as well, considering they are plastic pieces. They look edible, actually. I was tempted to pop one in my mouth. And the cardboard tiles are just outstanding, very nice quality!

Overall, a lovely experience. It's taken longer than printed on the box, but I've enjoyed it enough that I haven't cared. Three caveats:

1. Drafting makes this game 10x better, but doesn't work well on a first play, and adds slightly to play-length.

2. All my plays have been with the owner's house-rule on attacks: rather than "choose a player to lose (eg) 8 Plant", losses are divided equally among all opponents. [i](Remainder taken from the players with the most; break ties clockwise.)[/i] This loses  some in-your-face interactivity, but I think the game's a better experience for it, unless your group happens to be particularly fond of take-that dynamics.

3. While overall I like the "pay to keep a card" dynamics, I'm not fond of needing to do the "will keeping all the cards I want torpedo my plans for the turn?" math.

La calidad de la edición es pésima, los tableritos de los jugadores deberian estar troquelados para evitar que los cubos se dispersen a la mínima de cambio. Las losetas, tal y como las destroquelas, ya se desgastan por los bordes, y TODOS los cubitos metálicos tienen una esquina picada debido a cómo están fabricados. Sin embargo... juegazo!!! Recomendable 100% jugar con las dos variantes mencionadas, no concibo este juego sin el draft.

At its core it's just a too damn long engine-building resource conversor, but the brilliantly implemented theme and satisfying tile-placement mechanisms keep me coming back for more. My biggest complain, though, is the monotonous card design; most of them just read "rise this and/or reduce that", which keeps the game a bit too simple and repetitive for its own good. With more elaborated effects and player interaction this could've been a true masterpiece.

A fantastic game that is very simple to learn. I love the drafting element variant, it really challenges you to strategise right off the bat.

It's not a perfect game. The central game board feels sort of arbitrary; the area control is pretty uninteresting, the points you get from it at the end of the game feel very secondary to points you get elsewhere, and it ends up feeling like an overly small band-aid for the game's lack of player interaction. The cards are interesting but, by the end of the game, you've played so many of them that any amount of theme or character they may have had totally disappears, which is a shame given how intensively researched this game is. And it does seem like the player lucky enough to draw the cheaper, more playable cards early on is at a distinct advantage. Also, holy shit, what a terrible rule book.

To its credit, the player-selected awards and milestones are really smart and make for some very interesting gameplay decisions. I wish these were a bigger focus. And, of course, it's very satisfying to watch one's engine work in the second half of the game, even if it's working sub-optimally. This satisfaction is a bit of a crutch as far as the entire game is concerned.

What this game does well it does very well. But I'm not sure that what it does well is enough to make it worthy of worship.

Brilliant engine-building game with many paths to victory.  But you need the corporations and drafting to really make it shine, and that adds another hour to what's already a very long playtime.

Still, it's totally worth it.  This is easily the best new game I've played in 2017.

My only real complaint is the take-that cards, especially those that affect production.  It can really knock you around when you spend several turns setting up something only to have it taken away.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's only my initial rating after having played only five 2-player games.

The game itself is very good and satisfying. Building your own engine and searching for the best possible combinations is interesting and forces to think and to calculate. There is atmosphere to be found despite the game being an eurogame - you can actually FEEL the projects you're executing.

Yet I have a few problems about Terraforming Mars. In spite of popular opinion, I would love to see more negative interaction, even to the point when you're able to destroy other players' tiles or steal their projects. Why cannot an asteroid annihilate a city with its population? At this point, I feel like each player is making their own engine and doesn't care about others' actions too much. Yes, there is a race for the titles and prizes, there is stealing good spots for cities, greenery etc. - but that's not much. This is especially seen in the late game, where everyone makes a lot of actions and focuses only on himself. Maybe it's specific in my group only and not a serious issue. Another thing is that I think the game is a bit overlong and tends to be tiresome at the end, leading to the point where both of us are able to gain more victory points but instead we just raise temp/oxygen to finish the game. The last thing is randomness. This is a card-driven game, every card is unique and you try to do combos. Yet you may find yourself in a situation where you play city-oriented corporation and you don't draw a single card that allows you to place a city on the board. Doesn't sound fun? :P I haven't played with draft yet but I suppose this could solve the problem at least partly.

I think that the game has a HUGE potential that is not fully tapped. Therefore I'm waiting for an expansion in which I would love to see more interaction between players and more possibilities for card drawing/searching in the deck.

So, my INITIAL thoughts are: Terraforming Mars is a very good game, although a little bit overhyped. I say this as a person who's more keen on ameritrash though. I say this as a person who has played only 2 player game and without draft - so far. It's definitely not a final opinion and I'm especially looking forward to playing a 4-player game to see how it works.

Edit: After playing two 3-player games I keep my rating & overall opinion. The game is simply overlong. I noticed that I lose my interest for the actual game during the final 30-60 min and I just want it to end. It gets just tiresome to constantly calculate and optimize your moves and you want to raise oxygen/temperature to finish it. The interaction between players is too low. Everyone is just sitting and thinking about themselves, sometimes not even watching what others are doing. I get the fact that some more "peaceful" players would enjoy it. As a player who enjoys games like Forbidden Stars or Chaos in the Old World I find that Terraforming Mars is a game not entirely for me.

Very attractive game; easy setup, rather simple rules, but enough depth; theme is present prominently; interaction is limited; players have numerous choices during whole game and can reach their goals in different ways; the more players know which cards are in the game, the better and faster they will play; replay value is high, because of different corporations to play with, using a different strategy and wanting to improve scoring. Some luck is involved by card drawing.

I've played a couple of solo games now and it can be quite challening to meet all the hurdles before time runs out. So far, scores have been all over the place. But I like that, your decisions (and -to some extent- luck of the draw) do impact your game quite a bit. So far happy with this addition, although I will probably not get my son and/or wife to playing it with me.

3 Theme and Mechanics work well together. 

Playing the game with the same faction can be a whole different experience because of the hand you're dealt or rather that you draft.

Players are at the helm of a corporation. Together they terraform Mars. Each time they augment the oxygen level, the temperature or the number of ocean tiles their terraform rating (=VPs + important part of income) increases. This is done by buying and playing cards (each card is unique!), performing a standard project, or placing tiles on the surface of Mars. The city and greenery tiles placed are worth VPs at the end of the game. Extra VPs can be gained by achieving a milestone (and paying 8 M€) or by gaining an funded award (funded by any player). Many cards are also worth VPs (some negative). There are 3 types of cards: red event cards, green immediate effect cards, and blue action cards. The latter can be used once per generation (=playing round) or each time a certain requirement is met. During the action phase players take turns performing 1 or 2 actions until everyone has passed. Then the playing round ends. A production phase follows (production of money, steel, titanium, plants, energy and heat). Steel and titanium can be used as money to buy building cards and space cards respectively. Plants are used to place greenery tiles and augment the oxygen level, heat to augment the temperature, energy to buy specific cards. Energy left at the end of the action phase is automatically transformed into heat at the start of the production phase.
The game starts off slowly, as one has to build up production capacity. There are a lot of things one can do. Choosing is never easy. This can lead to some down time during the game. The plethora of unique cards make for a unique experience, though.

In the 2400s, mankind begins to terraform the planet Mars. Giant corporations, sponsored by the World Government on Earth, initiate huge projects to raise the temperature, the oxygen level, and the ocean coverage until the environment is habitable. In Terraforming Mars, you play one of those corporations and work together in the terraforming process, but compete for getting victory points that are awarded not only for your contribution to the terraforming, but also for advancing human infrastructure throughout the solar system, and doing other commendable things.

The heart and soul of this game is the absolute wonder of its deck: It´s not only very well balanced,intuitive, designed and linked with other game mechanics, it is also very well made in terms of a thematical scientific approach (even if a fictional one).
The income and rate prodution (similar in this regard with Trough the Ages, for instance) is another great asset of the game and it´s just rewarding for each player to see how his/hers engine prodution (provided by the cards) develops and works!

Excellent theme and implementation of it. Card play feels like a beefed up Race for the Galaxy, in a way, as one needs to decide which cards to keep that will synergize well (you can't afford all of them). One thing that concerns me is that strategy can be ruined if certain end-game tracks max out prior to you having a chance to benefit from certain long-term cards you had planned to utilize. I'm interested in exploring this game further, but I don't anticipate it will have much replayability like my favorites. 

I do find it to be a bit of a "heads down", not-really-knowing-what-opponents-are-up-to sort of feel to it, which I don't care for.

This is one of my favourite two player games going, with the drafting rule there's plenty of opportunity to mess with your opponents plans, and although the number of attack cards is minimal, they feel useful in the two player game.

The major reason I like this game is the diversity of strategies and engines you can build from game to game, it feels like many strategies are possible and you generally have the freedom to try out a number of different things per game.  With drafting you see a lot of cards, and are also generally prevented from assembling an overly degenerate combo.

The major issue with this game is that it loses a lot of its charm with a higher player count.  Drafting feels almost pointless, and without drafting the interaction goes way down.  Attacks feel less useful because you only effect one of your opponents, and it's difficult to pay attention to what everyone is doing to try to prevent them from carrying out their plan.  Maybe it's alright with three, but it's definitely only a 9.5/10 with two players.

[01 Nov 2016] - 8.25 (1 play)
Had one playthrough of this game at 4 players and loved it. Lots of things to do and lots of planning. Ended up coming in second on my first playthrough and didn't even mind the 3.5 hour playtime. Other reviews from various podcasters seem equally as favorable so I might have to pick up a copy of this game.


[24 Jan 2017] - 7.0 (3 plays)
Played this two more times at the four player count mark. The second game I was the tree corporation (can't remember the name) and was pretty much getting hammered by the other players until about a 1/3 of the way through the game I found a card to prevent being a target from tree attacks. Managed to claw my way back into the game but not enough. This game was really long with two players taking a lot of time to read each card and try to plan their turns.

In the third game, my corp was able to turn heat into money. I also combined that with an effect that would give me heat and money for every space card I played. That worked well but about halfway through the game I stopped getting space cards. Had to reconfigure the engine but it wasn't enough and I didn't get anything played onto Mars. This game was shorter since the players really pushed the terraforming parameters up hard.

After three games, I'm finding that the shine on this game is wearing off. The game is already long and most people don't want to play with the draft because of the extra time. This leaves most of it up to luck. Even with drafting, there's only one of every card making it possible to not get the cards you need (hate drafting) with no possible recourse. It would have been ideal if the designer provided more ways to mitigate this (bid for turn order, card auction, ability to go through discard pile, etc).

[15 Aug 2017] - 6.75 (4 plays)
There is just too much randomness in the cards, even with drafting, for this game to take 3-4 hours to play. With around 500 unique cards, it's almost near impossible early on to determine if you're going to see enough cards to make a strategy viable. Trying to solve with the simple draft at a fixed cost also makes it easy for players to hate draft cards and sell them for patents later on. In the last game, two of the four were doing that and killing all the Jovian tagged cards leaving me with very few early on and none come mid game. After hour 2 and finally understanding what had happened, there was no enjoyment in the game. The game really needs an auction for cards, but this would make the game unplayable.

Rating after ca. 10 games.
To make it challenging we always use cooperation auctions and (secret) card drafts, otherwise it would be too random for the tastes of people I play with.
Game flow/overview can be hampered by players' big card collections in late game, especially playing with 3-5 people. This can lead to situations where you constantly reconsider your opponents' cards (can be physically impractical/annoying) or decide not to care too much - a potential downside you have e.g. with Agricola too (but the latter is clearly a better game to warrant this IMHO).
In addition (opponent) turns might start getting boring if they have lot of actions in late game.
As of late 2017 pretty expensive compared with other games of equal or better play value and material (I did NOT consider this in my rating).

One play in, result were positive. Interesting decisions, both in terms of purchasing and placement, with some minor ways to mess with other players directly. So far, the closest thing that I've seen to [i]Offworld Trading Company[/i] as a board game.

Update: Had to drop my rating. Too much boils down to plant production, since plants + cities is where all the end points are. And since you don't have control over what you draw, there's little you can do if you don't draw the right cards. Plus, some familiarity with the cards gives too much of an advantage to experienced players over noobs, especially if you're drafting. While drafting may be more fair among equally experienced players, it also bloats the playing time.

Overall not a very difficult game, but does have a lot of aspects to learn which can make it seem overwhelming at first. After 5+ plays, I can say it is incredibly fun. While I do focus on winning, it is very fun just to play, even if you are loosing and are behind. 

Definitely recommend playing with the "Drafting" variant. Makes it more strategic on how you want to play the game rather than what cards you draw. 

Games do take 2+ hours to play, but it doesn't feel like it as turns are short so you are constantly doing actions and planning. Only setback is that it is not always easy to block out 2-3 hours to play.

Sleeving is 50/50 on whether it is necessary, cards are shuffled once per game.

The terraforming itself --- filling up the Mars grid with water, city, and plant hexes --- is nifty, and the production tracks are interesting. However, talk about card-driven....! And many of those cards feature take-that elements. The game seems lengthy, given that planning is problematic. There's only so much strategizing you can do when you're hoping to draw the right card, or another player is snatching your plants.

Card drawing luck can be critical - getting several affordable cards which increase your income (and ideally match your company's theme) is important for overall success. In my second game, I picked Inventrix (sp?) to get 3 extra cards, but amongst the total of 17 starting cards (including the first draw) I had but one card I could play to increase my income - and that was energy which doesn't jump-start nearly as well as a card which e.g. increases your money or steel or titan income.

The card drawing luck issue is mitigated once you move to card drafting, which I highly recommend to use beyond a first game.

RATING: 9.5
I would probably give this a 9.5 if the some of the components were slightly better.  The box is way too thin, and the cubes are either too shiny and therefore too slippery, or too transparent and look too much like each other when they are on the board.  The player mats are also a mess.  If you accidentally bump the table it can mess up your whole night as you can't remember where those resource cubes went on the mats.  Now the cards and actual board however were top notch.  All in all, this game right now rates as the game that I want to play the most, even after 2 play throughs this weekend.  So I got over the lack of quality of the components and rated the game on gameplay.  Still my favorite game. (Actually tied with Great Western Trail.)

RATING: 9
Liked it at first play, even though we didn't play it right, and stopped in the middle.  Really liked it at 2nd play with only 2 players.  Loved it after 3rd play w/ 4 players.

GOOD:  A whole lot of action cards, with no duplicates.  Multiple paths to victory.  Gorgeous art work on the cards. Good visual cues for game progress.  Tons of re-playability. Not a lot of downtime, unless playing with someone with AP tendencies.  The designer is on the BGG forums and answers every question. Wife really likes it, so it will get played!

BAD: Slightly confusing rulebook. Minimal player interaction except for a few "gotcha" cards. 

VERDICT:  I love this game!

Got the Broken Token insert.  It makes set up and take down so much faster, and makes the game much more accessible.

A little too heavy and fiddly for me, but an enjoyable one for that type of game.  Would make for a better experience if the components were more functional.  It's easy for things to get messed up if the table is bumped, and even easier to make a mistake with all of the 1, 5, and 10 cubes.

RATING: 6
Possibly the most enjoyable to play flawed game out there -

- Random card draw can deliver an easy win if one player draws cards with some obvious VP synergies. Not an issue with shorter games like 'Race for the Galaxy' but Terraforming Mars runs quite long for the winner to be possibly decided in this manner. If you use the drafting option this partly mitigates it but at the expense of a longer game. 
- There are a few 'take-that' cards but not enough to ensure that everyone takes their fair share.
- Financial and resource accounting can be a little fiddly.
- The player boards are not great for recording details as they are easily knocked.
- Overpriced in the UK 
- For the money the artwork on the cards should be stellar but it's a real hotch-potch of styles and quality. 

So a fun activity but significantly over-rated as a game on BGG.

Really, really good game where it all fits together nicely. I was a little afraid that it would be too complicated or too AP prone at first, but the turns went quick enough once we got going. The game itself was longish (3+ hours) but with a little more knowledge I think you can cut at least half an hour of the playtime.

Tense and fun with some planning and strategy involved but also a healthy dose of luck to draw the right card. All cards are not created equal which is a plus here. Also, that all cards are unique is a nice feature considering that there are more than 200 cards.

RATING: 8
My favorite game of a recent convention.  Excellent economic engine game.  I wonder how well it will hold up.  I can see it dropping a point or two.  The board is static. The cards are static.  Will certain cards or board spaces truly outshine others?  Will certain starting cards be better than others.  I started with the one that let you plant gardens for 7 green cubes.  That one also kick started your economy of green cubes.  It was very simple to execute and scored a ton of points.  Others have said this one often wins games.  This has me worried, but for now this game is a 9.

Dropping a notch (9-->8) after 4 plays.  I still like it quite a bit, but the shine has worn off just a little.

RATING: 7
A good game that is very similar in Imperial Settlers or 51 state. I played it several times and found that it is just too long for what it provides. The cards don't provide enough production so the game just drags on until you have 25+ cards in front of you and everybody else has played two or more games in the span of playing performing  Myers afraid I got rid of my copy because of this. Had great potential.

RATING: 9
A clever, thematic Euro, where players represent companies all contributing to the terraforming of Mars.  This is achieved by increasing the temperature, pumping oxygen into the thin atmosphere, and getting liquid water into the low bits on the planet.  

At heart its simply an engine building game where cards are purchased from a massive deck, and injected into the player's engines to accelerate their agendas.  There are about six resources to manage so Euro gamers will be in hog heaven.  However what impressed me was the solid science and well balanced cards (dozens and dozens of them) in the game.  

Very good.

Use the non-basic rules. Drafting is a must. Never use the 'basic corporation'. Always use the 'advanced' cards. My first play of the game we followed the rulebook's 'learn to play' section and I rate *that* basic game at about a 2 for total randomness. Even in two-player you should draft. Different corporations are 'best' based on player count, but every game plays differently.

The game is very thematic but unfortunately the mechanics of the scoring suffer from such theme-emphasis as they can be very fiddly and not very streamlined.  Generally, the game just feels very “fiddly": there were so many occurrences when we would place a tile and then ask, “do I raise the temperature or O2 level?”, or “Oh, did you raise the temperature already?”, or we would put down a tile of one color next to another tile of another color and ask, ‘wait do I get points for this color tile combination, but not for this other color tile combination?”  I guess placing curtain combinations of colored tiles next to other colored tiles makes sense from a thematic standpoint, but honestly, I wasn’t paying much attention to the theme and it all just felt very fiddly.   

The text on the cards (and the board) are very thematic in their terminology, but it just seemed to cause confusion amongst players as to what the cards actually did.  I can’t count how many times the game stopped dead as someone asked, “What does this card mean here?”  We would draw our four cards at the beginning of each round and then just sit there in silence as we pondering what the cards did.  There are just SO MANY cards, and they are SO varied and random; you can’t possibly aim for any specific cards (or even types) to develop some specific strategy.  Its all about hoping to get lucky.  And some of those “Take That” cards; WOW (!) they can be so detrimental to other players and become real game-changers: even MORE randomness here!  Randomness in a shorter game is tolerable, but not in a three hour game.  

Honestly, I pretty much ignored the use of the cards for the most part both because of drawing really crappy cards and out of frustration trying to figure out what they do.  I mostly focused on getting money, and placing tiles and filling up the board with my colored cubes.  This is a low scoring game, so every point is valuable.  If I was lucky to draw a card with a high victory point value, I would spend the money and put it down, regardless of its ‘ability’.  I really neglected my engine and really thought I would come in last place as all the other players had tons and tons of cards in front of them.  To my surprise, I came in second in a five-player game because I had a city surrounded by lots and lots of forests and oceans and some brown-tile thing that I still don’t know what it did.  There doesn’t seem to be a direct a correlation between building your engine and getting enough points to win the game.  

Generally, I found the game too random, fiddly and long.  I would recommend this game for hard-core gamers that have a strong interest in the Terraforming Mars theme and the patience to play this a few times to let the idiosyncrasies of the rules settle in (there is a high learning-curve here).  However, for the general audience looking for a card-driven game that manipulates a board, I would recommend ‘Bruges’ or the original ‘Agricola’ as their rules are more streamlined, cards well-balanced, play faster and less prone to Analysis Paralysis.

I played Terraforming Mars for nigh on 3 hours and that time sped by. Come the end I felt that I could have played for another 3 hours. The game was so interesting with such a diverse but interesting selection of cards to see on every round that I was fully involved and engaged throughout.

We played the full game including drafting and I would recommend that even for your first game. The game is not complex and there really is no need to play the intro starting cards nor the stripped down deck (unless you want a shorter game). Drafting is essential to allow you to get the cards you need to work combos well.

There are some take-that cards which are a little blunt, but that aside on the whole this is multi-player solitaire on a shared map.

An excellent Euro game with a huge amount of replayability.

This game is terrific! Fantastic marriage of theme and mechanics. Variable player powers, card drafting, action-selection and resource management are all enriched by a really cool planet exploration theme. I've played at least 6 times and have used a different strategy each time thanks to the variable player powers (in the form of unique corporations) you get at the beginning of the game. There are so many corporations, I don't see this game feeling repetitive any time soon. Plus, all the cards feel extremely well balanced and unique.

RATING: 8.9
Component quality is not top notch, but you get a cool Mars board, and some supercool chrome plated plastic cubes (a la Pandemic, but metallic looking!).

The planet's initial conditions aren't ideal for earthly life, but your big company and the ones controlled by the other players will compete to have the most impact in the terraforming process by raising oxygen levels in the atmosphere, increasing the temperature and creating oceans on Mars' gorges.

It's cool, it's easy to learn and pretty satisfying. The theme alone is likely gonna make it for most sci-fi fans boardgamers out there. After 8 or so playthroughs I lowered my ranking a bit, but still a solid game.

This game an example of how [b]Dominant Species[/b] would play like if it was exclusively played using 300 different cards. Oh yes, there are 300 cards and no 2 cards are the same. At first it seems like a huge amount of information because every card does something different and there is a lot of text, but after two games you realize it is indeed true: there is a lot of information in your hands. Cards are drafted every turn, but still, there is a huge amount of randomness.
The game play is fun. Story arch is very enjoyable since all players are trying to make habitable planet out of Mars, and you watch oceans, forests and cities grow as well as temperature and oxygen level. But there can be only one winner in the end - the corporation who did the most stuff. And while the leader can be seen early, there is always competition until the very end. 
Enjoyable game but a bit slow, and random.

[b]Favorite mechanism:[/b] Asymmetric factions which greatly direct the play style. And drafting.

I thought the art would really put me off this one, but once I saw it in person I thought it was actually kind of charming - the mashup of different styles actually seems to lend itself to the theme of here are some snapshots of what martian terraforming may look like.  Looking at the art made me feel like I was being pitched different models for terraforming.  I also really like when games give you personal action cards to exploit, and TM seems to be chock full of them.  

The only negatives I have are that the graphic design is ugly and the iconography is kind of confusing - but it’s still better than Race for the Galaxy.  After half a game you should have it down.  The length of the game could be a knock against it as well, except that it’s tied to one of the factors that makes this game so fun - the race to terraform the planet.

Despite the game’s complexity it feels really sticky - after one play I feel I could go back to the game months from now and just start playing with very minimal rules referencing.  

Out of the 2016 darlings, I’d definitely say this is the best on the Euro end of the equation.  And were it not for Star Wars Rebellion I’d say it’s the best of the year.  I need to play both some more to see where I stand.

If you love card driven games like Deus, Imperial Settlers, Lewis and Clark, etc, and don’t mind a longer one, Terraforming Mars is great!

An excellent game that has quickly become one of our favourites to play!  Although lengthy, the science concepts, and the heavy emphasis on a current, engaging theme make the time pass enjoyably.  All of the cards are unique which provides many options for developing your production engine.  However, randomness of 4 card draw necessitates playing with some form of drafting variant.  Rulebook could be tweaked a bit to more clearly explain actions/turn vs. actions/generation, as well as the stacking of cumulative effects.  Production markers need a firmer footing on player board to avoid confusion – perhaps thicker player board with recessed slots, or trays (which a third party is currently developing).  Except for the minor complaints listed (which can be easily addressed in subsequent iterations), this is a game that has us thinking about it even when the game is not on the table – a definite sign of a top notch game!

Perhaps expectations were too high for this game, but didn't quite live up to the hype for me. A really good, solid game but doesn't quite reach the lofty place I thought it would. The 208 unique cards are great, but on a first play, it's very difficult to form any kind of strategy. I also wasn't too fond of the take that element. I suspect the rating could go up to an 8 or higher if I'm able to play this enough to know what to expect. I also think the draft variant is a must.

This is the only game in many years that no one in my game group will turn down and one picky member who does not  care to replay games is asking for it. I upped my rating to a 10.

Terraforming Mars, over the past 6 months-ish, is the new darling euro. I didn't really like the mish-mash of artwork on the cards. I also didn't like that I've heard this game can go 3+ hours. Upon playing this, I can see it's appeal. It's an engine-building game that focuses on the production of 6 main resources, with money being the most versatile. Using money and potentially resources, the players will play cards that will increase their production, give them special icons, help fulfill terraforming goals (such as creating oceans, increasing the oxygen level, and increasing the temperature on the planet), attack players, create settlements on the planet, and a variety of other effects. The game ends when all of the terraforming goals have been achieved. 

The card count for this game is actually quite staggering compared to most games. In addition, you can play with a unique faction that has it's own unique special ability and starting money. There is quite a variety of these as well. The game has an interesting goal system where you spend money and use an action to claim a 'most goal,' but if another player has the most by the end of the game, they get the points. There is also a race to achieve "first goals." These should sound familiar to Race for the Galaxy, with the 'most' being a little different. In fact, I feel this game has a lot in common with Race for the Galaxy... it's just played on a board and is about 4 - 6 times longer, depending on how quickly you play either game.

Not only can I see its appeal, but it's a good game that I enjoy. A thing of note: there doesn't seem to be a 100% consensus on how people enjoy playing this game. Some people like to draft cards, some don't. Some people like to use the unique factions and some don't (because they think they could be unbalanced). Some people like to start this game with having a production of one in all the six main resources to speed up the somewhat long play time and others don't. 

Basically, if you hated the icon system in Race for the Galaxy or you wanted to play a longer, more complicated version of that game, this is definitely one worth trying.

Note to Self: Try these coop rules...

* Set up the board per the solo rules. Generally, follow all solo rules.
* Players start at 14 TR (per the solo rules)
* Players have 12 generations to fully terraform Mars and score as high as possible.
* Any card that would remove resources/production/tokens from an opponent instead ADDS those resources/production/tokens to your partner, if possible.
* When players receive cards at the start of a round, they may each give one card to their partner. However, a player can still only buy a max of 4 cards at the start of the round.

If wanting to try for high scores: Alternatively, start with 20 TR instead of 14. Still play for 12 generations; aim to break 200 points and fully terraform Mars.

Terraforming Mars is littered with both greatness and mediocrity. The product value is shoddy, with thin cards and player boards, and pitifully incongruous art. It also lacks focus. The objectives are clear (terraform mars), but there are several tangential paths players can take which divert the focus from the objective at hand, to marginal victory point gains. Length is also a bit of an issue, and the game would benefit greatly from a balanced set of production asymmetries, which would add variety and speed up the game. Lastly, due to the sheer amount of unique cards, some are certainly more powerful (and/or) situational than others, which over such a long game makes this imbalance more noticeable. However, the game is fun. Crashing comets, erecting cities, and building solar lenses is fun, and the cards help establish the scope of the game. The paying for cards is this game's most unique contribution. Not only does needing to pay to draw cards help mitigate card draw luck, but it monkeys with your pace and creates a lot of interesting interplay between long- and short-term strategies. All together, I enjoy Terraforming Mars, but its definitely a short term relationship. Once the novelty of its cards has run dry, there will be little reason to tolerate its shortcomings.

If Race for the Galaxy and CO2 got together and produced an offspring, this would be it.  Card drafting, tableau building, tile laying, resource management, exquisite engine building, variable starting abilities (Corporate Era) -- plus it is scientifically dazzling and educational, with the theme shining through most brightly.  And it has an excellent solitaire mode.  A truly wonderful game.

Rating is based off of solo play only.  Which is saying a lot, because solo board gaming is not really my thing.

That said, I have [I]really[/I] enjoyed playing solo and I am certain I would love it with more players, but I have a hard time seeing this one make it to our table - primarily due to the heavy, heavy reliance on cards driven by text.  My wife, who is my most reliable gaming partner, claims that extensive text on cards makes her brain melt.  I have seen it, it's true.

It's too bad really, because this game deserves better from me - but I fear it will most likely be limited to a solo adventure that I will break out from time to time.

It's a little obtuse to figure out the rules the first time around. It takes about two or three generations to get things down, but the gameplay is great. My only real complaints are that the materials themselves aren't the highest quality (thin cards, resource cubes are a bit slick, player boards are cardstock and easy to shift about) and that even with all the information packed on it, the board feels a little small, especially for a five player game. Definitely one of the best games I've played, though.

Very fun engine building game. Dripping with theme.

Best played with stock rules (no draft, no corporate era) if you want to keep it at a 2-2.5 hour game. Bogs down with the variants - timewise and pacing wise. Luck in stock rules is heavy mitigated by the following strategy: aim to secure an early milestone and strategically use standard actions to lock others out of key areas.

If we're talking about corporate era + draft variant that is in the rulebook, the rating goes down to a 6.5, because playtime is bumped to 3.5 hours, and that's just too long for this sort of a game as it overstays its welcome.

Certainly fun.  Across plays with 2, 3 and 5 players, I've found a run-away leader situation.  You certainly have to play the cards you're dealt; however, once you find a way to leverage for points -- you get even more money -- which in turn helps to find ways to score even more points.

Excellent, fun, scientific, love so many aspects about this game except for two things:
1. Randomness - The card drawing mechanic doesn't quite balance by the end of the game, making luck a strong enough factor that it hurts game play.  By example, I once pulled a card on the opening draw that ended up being worth roughly 15% of my total vp's, not including ancillary benefits and I won as a result.  Drafting the cards helps, but it makes a long game longer.

2. Component quality - I can only name a few instances where I wanted to actually flip a table (the others largely involve games where dice are rolled), but a slight bump or slide of your player card and hours of play are lost.  Overlay player boards should have been included in the base game at a minimum.  I appreciate all the cool add-ons people have made for the game and do not normally complain about a hit to the wallet, but the game is virtually unplayable without paying the same cost of the game in upgrades for components.  To put it another way, it is like playing Jenga on the side, and the risk of toppling escalates as the game goes on.

In the 2400s, mankind begins to terraform the planet Mars. Giant corporations, sponsored by the World Government on Earth, initiate huge projects to raise the temperature, the oxygen level, and the ocean coverage until the environment is habitable. In Terraforming Mars, you play one of those corporations and work together in the terraforming process, but compete for getting victory points that are awarded not only for your contribution to the terraforming, but also for advancing human infrastructure throughout the solar system, and doing other commendable things.

The players acquire unique project cards (from over two hundred different ones) by buying them to their hand. The projects (cards) can represent anything from introducing plant life or animals, hurling asteroids at the surface, building cities, to mining the moons of Jupiter and establishing greenhouse gas industries to heat up the atmosphere. The cards can give you immediate bonuses, as well as increasing your production of different resources. Many cards also have requirements and they become playable when the temperature, oxygen, or ocean coverage increases enough. Buying cards is costly, so there is a balance between buying cards (3 megacredits per card) and actually playing them (which can cost anything between 0 to 41 megacredits, depending on the project). Standard Projects are always available to complement your cards.

Your basic income, as well as your basic score, is based on your Terraform Rating (starting at 20), which increases every time you raise one of the three global parameters. However, your income is complemented with your production, and you also get VPs from many other sources.

Each player keeps track of their production and resources on their player boards, and the game uses six types of resources: MegaCredits, Steel, Titanium, Plants, Energy, and Heat. On the game board, you compete for the best places for your city tiles, ocean tiles, and greenery tiles. You also compete for different Milestones and Awards worth many VPs. Each round is called a generation (guess why) and consists of the following phases:

1) Player order shifts clockwise.
2) Research phase: All players buy cards from four privately drawn.
3) Action phase: Players take turns doing 1-2 actions from these options: Playing a card, claiming a Milestone, funding an Award, using a Standard project, converting plant into greenery tiles (and raising oxygen), converting heat into a temperature raise, and using the action of a card in play. The turn continues around the table (sometimes several laps) until all players have passed.
4) Production phase: Players get resources according to their terraform rating and production parameters.

When the three global parameters (temperature, oxygen, ocean) have all reached their goal, the terraforming is complete, and the game ends after that generation. Count your Terraform Rating and other VPs to determine the winning corporation!

Component quality of the first print run is not amazing, however not nearly as poor as people make it out to be. The cubes will chip over time, and the player mats are a little thin but not to a detriment. Aside from the production quality the game play is quite deep yet not paralyzing in its options. For the full experience definitely play with the draft variant and all the cards for the 'full game'. Easily my top game of 2016.

The only complaint I have with this game is the lengthy setup. Otherwise this is one of my favorite games and my wife's favorite. It truly is one of the best engine building games I've played and the complex cards are made beautifully straightforward by the simple explanations and clear symbols. Yea, the components aren't the best but the gameplay makes up for it. It's great that the game timer depends on the players and they drive the game. I've found that with each card drawn my strategy tends to change. The game is very rewarding as each card provides unique gains and losses, sometimes from your own resources or from another player. Do you buy a bunch of cheap cards to quickly build a small engine or do you wait to buy that expensive card that gives you an abundance of resources immediately. Choices. An awesome game that hasn't been given as much attention as it deserves.

RATING: 5
The game itself is a solid design but it's just boring, and after three games I have no interest whatsoever in revisiting it. Not enough exciting card synergies to give you an arc to be excited about. It's just micro synergies for micro advancements over and over for 3 hours. Pretty much the same thing throughout the game without much of a source of tension. Player interaction is a bit of lame "take that" in resource/income thieving. Competition on the board for spaces is mild. Yawn. 

The game is not an engine builder but rather an income builder. The ostensible fun of the game is building up your income so you can play more and better cards as the game goes on. But turns out without an engine of your own, you're just hoping for fortuitous card draws to give you something interesting to do with your monies. The happenstance of the cards you draw relative to your intended strategy combined with how lame the synergies of the cards are results in a solid game that works but just is uninspiring.

To be clear, I don't think it's a bad game, just a squarely mediocre one. For a better implementation of card/tile combinations and player interaction, I highly recommend Zhang Guo, The Capitals, or Race for the Galaxy.

I really like the theme and how it is implemented somewhat realistically. Terraforming Mars takes generations in the game; I don't think it would happen overnight in real life either. I also like how you have to figure out which cards will be the most helpful to you and when you should use them. I do not like how the primary inter-player interaction seems to be targeted take-that cards, how it feels a little more complicated than deep, and how some actions have too many effects that you need to remember to resolve (I always feel like I am forgetting to do something).
-
I think it's better with two players because there is less downtime and less targeting of the leader. It may also be an example where too much of the fun comes from winning for me (and little fun comes when when I lose).

I enjoyed:
- being able to select scoring conditions
- looking at the pretty main board

I disliked:
- how terrible the component quality is (One slight movement of the table, and we're all freaking out about where our cubes were on our tracks. Why are the player boards such thin, flimsy paper? Why not put the time and money into making thick boards with indentations for cubes to lay into and prevent movement? Why is the art so inconsistent in style on all the cards? Why not put in the time and money to come up with solid, consistent art on all the cards? Why would a publisher half-ass SO MUCH of the game? Why would a publisher hate its customers like this?)
- the kinda arbitrary placement of stuff on the map (Why can I only build this specific city only in this spot? Maybe I want it on the tile above? Or on the other side of the planet.)
- the so very repetitive nature of it all (Buy cards. Maybe use them. Move a/some cubes. Get more cubes. Repeat.)
- that for how "scientific" this game is, it's still not very realistic (Smashing a moon into the planet would wipe out pretty much everything that we have accomplished up to this point. Puppies? Warm temperature? Yeah, they're gone. Welcome to the Ice Age.)
- the engine that I'm building with the cards is just not satisfying at the end of the game ("I did it. There are cubes and tiles on the map. Huh." Just such a hollow feeling after so long a time spent looking at awful cards and rearranging my cubes because of table bumps.)
- that the game does not reward more plays because it's so ridiculously balanced (I was just two points away from the winning player, who had played this game many more times than me. This doesn't feel right.)
- there's not much strategy beyond "Use the cards to build your engine" (You avoid this, and you lose. The corporation you play as is just a trick to make you feel like you're playing a different game every time, but you're not.)
- that the corporations are too simple in the asymmetry that it doesn't really matter what you choose to play as (It's just such a tiny tweak that it's not even worth bothering to play as a corporation.)
- that there were so many occasions that I actually DIDN'T want to advance the game because it would mean someone else would score something on a track, thereby prolonging the repetitive nature of the game even more (The game rewards you RESISTING playing the game. This is messed up.)
- that the game drags on for far too long, and if you play the game strategically, it drags on for EVEN LONGER

Final verdict: How are people just so blind to this game's ridiculous list of problems?

I tend to not like games that take over 2 hours, so when I played this 6 times in 2 weeks, that's saying something.

This game hits the sweet spot between playing the long game and improvisation. I famously hate games that take over 2 hours, but I loved the 3+ hour games of this. The game can get a little laggy from option overload at the end, and I'm not sure of what to think of the attack cards in 3+ player games, but these are only minor quibbles and what is otherwise a total blast to play.

NOTE TO SELF: Do not play while tipsy. You take attack cards personally when tipsy.

A fantastic well-themed game, and as an undergraduate chemistry major, I applaud the designer who has a Ph.D. in it.  The only reason I don't give this game a 10 is because of the small print on the cards which makes it a bit challenging for those, like me, who are now farsighted, as well as chance that the cubes used on the player board to mark production rates could accidentally move (for which there is now an overlay from Broken Token).  Otherwise, this game is a splendid gaming experience of tableau building, drafting (I prefer the variant for allocating the cards draw each generation), replayability galore, a solitaire variant, and multiple paths to victory-deserving of the best game of the year award for 2016, if Great Western Trail doesn't get it.

I am still in the "exploration" phase of this game, but so far there is a ton of depth and so many different ways to score it is crazy. Loving it, at least for now. 

Compaints?  Well, it runs way longer than the stated 120min, but maybe that is us still learning. And also, it seems that the randomness of card selection can be a problems, especially as some of the card combos seem pretty powerful. But, there are so many cards in this game and so many ways to get points, I wonder if this complaint is just loser whining. Or maybe not.

After 4 plays: Interesting asymmetric interactions of the different goods (money, steel, titanium, plants, energy, & heat) plus cards in hand and tiles added to map.  Map building aspect adds a bit of player interaction and thematic depth to a basic hand management game.    Tokens are nice.  Interaction of cards and theme icons is difficult to strategize, but adds interesting synergy effects (overall a plus).

Some weaknesses: suffers a bit from from victory point salad, with some arbitrary goals ("milestones" and "awards") and bonuses strewn about (though they also add a race aspect with the other players).  Tends a bit toward solitaire with most of your focus on your hand and not reacting to your opponents' plays.

German 2nd Edition + Promo from Schwerkraft Verlag.
Expected delivery Jan/Feb 2017 - Got it, 21st of February - Germany!

This "gem" is the expected positive surprise from the 2016/17 gaming season!
Including exploring, development (on player board (own company) and main game board (Mars)), tile placement and drafting elements. The right decision on the right time is a huge factor. Deciding between one action or two following action on your turn is important to be succesful as well looking at your opponents possible strategies and developments! 
We played over three hours (with new players) but we diddn't had any feel of lenghts, nobody was looking any time at the clock..., everybody is involved and excited what will happen on the board, which development the current player will reveal! You could not really plan what to do next, because you have to react too, but to be succesful (winning the game) you have to follow "your" strategie. Concentrade on your strength but everytime open to change in favour to the new revealed project cards and opportunities given by the turns from your opponents before.
This game is till now a real 10! (And we haven't dicovered the whole game till now!)

So many funny and interesting things you can do in this game. The replayability is endless due to all the cards.

The design of this game is brilliant. Very simple to learn and get started right away and very fun to play. The iconography and science aspects add a lot flavor to what could be a very dry (pun intended) theme. The way the cards are all unique and important and valuable opens the game up for lots of options, but at the same time, you can only afford a small subset of those options.

A very tight and well-balanced game with asymmetric starting positions. Rare to find a game like that.

While I will never again play this game with 5 even at the base level, this is one I love to play solo or with a few people along with the Corporate cards.
Generating the engine from nothing and building up to filling the board, branching into one of the many viable strategy options available, be it environmentalism, buildings, space, money, etc and seeing how all the players culminate at the end is a rewarding journey.
The theme draws players in, the interaction is there if you want it and it scales to a variety of different players making Terraforming Mars one of the years gaming highlights.

There ARE a couple things I find annoying about this game:

- at a normal pace this is a THREE hour game, make no mistake. Many of my games are close to three hours. I did play one tournament game that lasted 1.5 hours - using the corporate set up.  

- the wording in the rule book and on the cards is just not clear and is incomplete. An official errata - beyond the bgg thread started by the designer - is badly needed. How about a rewrite of the rules? I shouldn't be questioning procedures after 10+ plays. 

Things I love:

- for a game this streamlined, the theme is excellent and well integrated. 
- the cards are well thought out; the art, names, costs, and effects really make the theme come to life. 

The hype is real, but a gamers game for sure.

A solid Euro with good, but not GREAT, theming.  Not as complex as the bgg weight seems to suggest.  Overall, I like it, but am not as crazy about it as others, perhaps because I am less crazy about pure euros.

RATING: 7.5
Great feeling, good card variety, but i think direct-interaction cards (like remove a resource or lower an income for a player of your choice) are a little annoying and give the game a risk of "bash the leader" and "kingmaking"

I shall start by saying that this was not what I was expecting.  I hadn’t read a lot about Terraforming Mars as it looked to me like a heavy weight, dry euro game and I’m just not enjoying those at the moment.  However, I was quite surprised to find that it is a light-medium weight card game that has a board in the same way that Trains is a deck builder with a board.

It is an interesting beast and seems to be a patchwork of different ideas ripped from other games; in fact, I haven’t played a game, watched a film or read a book in recent memory that so obviously and so liberally borrowed concepts and ideas from its piers.  I’ll get on to that a bit more later, but first we’ll look at how it plays.

We started with “Beginner Companies”, which is to say that they are all the same.  The same starting resources, the same starting production and no special powers.  You then get dealt a hand of 10 cards each from the top of an enormous deck (which would have been twice the size if we hadn’t taken out the ‘advanced cards’) and that’s it.  Almost the entire game revolves around these cards.

The cards themselves are loosely split into 3 types: green, blue and red.  Green are the most common and usually involve a onetime bonus, such as increasing the amount of one resources that you produce at the end of the round or increase the amount of that resources that you have right now.  Others are a more complex, such as exchanging one unit of one resource for 2 of another, but once they have been used they are added to your tableau where the squat there until the end of the game.  They have no further effects but there are icons at the top which may be relevant for scoring.  Then you have the rarer blue cards, which usually give you a powerful bonus of playing them, such as a pile of resource X and then sit in your tableau and can be activated again once a round for a benefit, usually a resource cube.  Lastly there are the somewhat common (Although I only got 1 throughout the entire game) red cards, which usually (but not always) screw over another player by targeting their resources, ability to produce resources, or their tableau.  These again are one shot and are then discarded.

You can take one or two actions on your turn, or you can pass, which means that you can no longer take part in the rest of the round.  There is a list of actions that you can take, but mostly (and especially early on) you will be simply playing cards from your hands to create a tableau.  Except that sometimes you won’t. 

Issue 1

An issue that I picked up on early in the game is that a lot of cards have costs or requirements that have to be met, similar to Spartacus where you have to have a certain amount of influence to play.  Here it may be that one of the 3 tracks has to be above or below  or on a certain number.  This created a peculiar situation whereby within my initial hand of 10 cards, there was only one that I could play.  It wasn’t until later in the round and through other players affecting the game state that I was able to play a second card, which would turn out to be the last.  This somewhat uneven setup can create a real imbalance within the first round, whereby some players with rush of with the beginnings of fantastic engines, whereas some will just be left floundering, which leads me into my second issue.

Issue 2

Issue number 2 with the game, is that it has a bit of a runaway leader issue and also tends to reward those who are doing well and punish those who are not.  For example, after the first round Andy had been able to play quite a few cards from his hand: 2 greens, 2 reds and 1 blue.  As such he had quite a substantial lead and has knocked me and Stephen backwards as well as getting a powerful blue card out that could be activated each round for free.  I was in second and Stephen was in third, and this is exactly how the game finished.  I think the issue herein lies that your current victory point total is your base income!  Meaning that the more VPs you have, the more money you have in the next round meaning you can play and more importantly, buy more cards, making your tableau and therefore your position stronger.  Interestingly, the only way (apart from a few spaces on the board) that you can obtain new cards is between round where you are dealt 4 at random and can then choose to keep as many as you like, but have to pay 3 credits each.  Therefore, the better you are doing, the more money you have, the more cards you can buy, the more cards you can play, the better you do.  It ramps up exponentially.  Furthermore, the red cards can be devastating; if you are lucky enough to be dealt them then you have to be able to afford to play them.  This again means that the player with the most resources can further trample on the weak engines of those who they are trying to catch up.  Then we come to the mile stones.  These add a race element to the game, such as being the first to put 3 cities on the board, or the first to put down 8 vegetation tiles or build 8 buildings (represented by the brown building symbol on some of the cards in your tableau).  So, if you are doing well and winning, chances are you will be the first to complete one or more of these, giving you a 5 VP bonus for each.  However, to complete them you have to buy them at a cost.  Now, a balancing mechanic that I have seen in a lot of games is that the first person to a powerful achievement has to pay the most, or faces an additional barrier, such as in Le Havre where in order to use the dock to build an iron ship, you also have to ‘modernise’ it by paying additional brick resources.  In Terraforming Mars, it is the opposite; the first person to reach a milestone gets it for 8 and then the price goes up to 16 and then 24 for subsequent ones.  Furthermore, there are 5 available but only 3 can be claimed and each only once, so it is entirely possible that you could be locked out of ever getting one.  There are also awards which work in much the same way to further exasperate the issue.

Issue 3

This game can be extremely random, with the cards that you draw and that your opponents draw determining what actions can be taken over the course of the entire round.  At this point I should point out the on the board are printed a selection of “Public Endeavours”, which can be used by anyone and function in a similar way to the green cards, in that you spend credit and take the action, such as putting down a vegetation tile, ocean tile etc.  The issue with these, and the reason why I have neglected to mention them up until this point, is that they are just far too expensive and limited.  Furthermore, as there are not cards involved, there is nothing to add into your tableau, therefore potentially denying yourself VPs at the end of the game from scoring certain icons.  However, they are there and it would be remiss of me not to mention them.  Back to the issue in hand.  This game borrows quite heavily from Seasons (and apparently Race for the Galaxy, but I haven’t played that), but without the ability to plan out your turns.  To mitigate the inherent luck in Seasons, you claim all of the cards that you will be using over the course of the game at the beginning, and then can allocated them evenly to each of the games 3 round.  This way you know in advance what is going to be available and therefore you can plan accordingly.

As I mentioned earlier, in Terraforming Mars you are at the mercy of your starting hand, a massive deck of unique card, and then at the mercy of what cards you draw throughout the course of the game.  There is simply no way to get around the fact that some cards are just much better than others, and some cards combine really well, but only if you get them both into your hand.  This wouldn’t be such an issue with a smaller car pool, but the deck around 200 unique cards and therefore the chances of getting the 2 or 3 that you need is slim at best.  Other games that rely heavily on cards get around this by having a central pool of cards that you can purchase, think Nations, Through the Ages, City of Iron, which allows you to mitigate some of the randomness and plan accordingly.  Furthermore you can see if a player takes a card that could affect you negatively compose a strategy to protect yourself against the potentially negative effects of that.  In Terraforming Mars you never know what card players have received or have in their hands.  Furthermore, anything that they choose not to buy is discarded face down so that you have no idea what they are planning and how it could potentially affect you.  This can be problematic, especially as the margins between success and failure can be so small, but also removes some of the interaction as you are no longer interested in other players turns until they hit you with something that causes your economy to crumble.  Furthermore, there is also the issue that as there are is not a set number of turns - there are no ages and therefore no progression in what cards are available and when.  This means that you may be dealt a hand of late game cards early on, which are effectively useless, or early game cards at the end when all you want to do is add VPs to your tableau, both of which can be very frustrating.  Going back to Spartacus, which often is criticised for the blind drawing of cards during the intrigue phase, this offsets these issues by allowing you to sell the cards as you get them, with a reward that is roughly equivalent to the cards usefulness, meaning that if you have cards that you cannot or do not want to use, you can sell them immediately for a sizeable reward in coins which you will be able to use on a later phase.  In Terraforming Mars, if you are dealt cards that are of no use, then tough luck, you just discard them for nothing and the actions that are available to you on the following turn are now far more limited.

A way to get around this somewhat is by using the card drafting variant, as described in the back of the rule book, which leads me on to …

Issue 4

Playtime.  This game is not quick, despite being relatively simple.  Our first play with 3 of us clocked in at around 2 hours 45 minutes, which is quite a chunk of time.  As a point of reference it took us longer to play Terraforming Mars with 3 then it did to play Mage Knight the week prior with 3.  The drafting method, which follows standard drafting rules and is implemented between rounds when you received the 4 random cards, would further add to this play time.  Furthermore, I’m not sure how suited this game is to drafting, as all of the cards are so random, or situational, or unique that you can really plan or create combinations as you don’t know if you will ever get the other cards required in a later draft, if at all, to make your engine work, or if a really situation card will ever be relevant.

Issue 5

I won’t spend too long on this one, but the components are a joke for a game that costs £65.  The card stock is some of the thinnest I have ever seen, then player boards are the same and look like they have been designed in MS paint and the art across the game is inconsistent and poor.

In conclusion, Terraforming Mars is, in my humble opinion, an okay game, but one that mechanically just isn’t very good.  It reminds me of a pop song that is at first striking, but on subsequent listens just doesn’t hold up.  It is also endemic of the myopic nature of board games that this currently resides at number 10 on BGG, as it does make a great first impression, after which the masses rush to the website to rate it as the best thing ever, when in reality and upon reflection, it is anything but.

One 5-player game. A dreadfull experience. I am rating the play session rather than the game here.

We were two new players and 3 quite experienced ones around the table. My friends refrained from using the "starting player rules" (i.e. starting corporation & keep all 10 starting cards for free), they probably completly forgot that these rules existed. Still I am a bit mad at them since this adjustement is clearly here for a reason. I could do much for most of the game turns, never managed to really kick off my economy and had to watch all the others to gazillions of actions per turn. If we had used the new player rules I might have found a way to mitigate this using the left-over cards and money, but I had none, too bad.. 

I did like the mechanics, theme but when you do not know the game at all it is next to impossible to make pertinent choices. I built a nice space valorizing engine with my starting cards  (-4 on space cards, bonuses for space events) but was NEVER dealt a single space card in the 7 or 8 next game turns (???). 

Nonetheless, I am quite decided to play again and I am confident that this rating will go up.

I've only played twice, and this is definitely a game that needs a few plays to properly get the hang of.
Still, my first play was nice — I wasn't entirely sure what I was doing, but I was impressed with the diversity of the cards, all the moving parts, and it felt thematic and relatively fun. I even like the art. My second game, during which we drafted, was kind of brutal. Another player played a few aggressive cards that took the legs out of my first few terraforming efforts, and I just couldn't get any coherent engine together. In the end I was far behind, pretty much just waiting for the end to finally arrive. So: Bleh.
Clearly this is a rich, complex game. But for the moment, though I'd be willing to play it again, I won't seek it out.

MAY 2017: Merely a decent combination of Race for the Galaxy and Terra Mystica, except that it isn't as spatially or factionally interesting as TM, or as mechanically interesting as RftG.

MAR 2017: Re-bought. Taught two friends to play. With basic corporations in your first couple plays, it feels like you are just playing at the fringes of how good this game will be. Careful comboing and focus on strategy and transitioning to different focuses at different times is a fun engine-building challenge. My 8 is solid right now. Too interesting to rate a 6, but possibly too MPS and not strong enough at 2p to be a 10.

After one play, I now know why so many are impressed with this game.  Lots of choices but I never felt bogged down.  Unlimited actions! --I love this game! 

 I agree with others that there should be some compensation in the game for going last, as I did.  Everyone else got two turns of going first, but I got only 1.  Going first is critical especially during the last few rounds of the game, and also for opponents taking your resources before you can use them.

I detest the cheap playboards.  One little bump & you have no idea where all the production cubes were.  For a few bucks more cardboard cutouts would have greatly improved the quality.  Yes I can purchase from Etsy, etc., plastic overlays--the cheapest for 5 being $30 plus shipping.  I much rather pay an extra $20 for the game.  This is why I am not buying the game --except maybe used so can afford the  3rd party overlays.  This is also why I did not rate the game an 8.

Very good Card and Engine building game.  The Draft variants are basically required, otherwise too much luck in card draw.  The components are pretty, but not particularly functional.  Accidentally bumping your production markers or mistakes when moving the various cubes between regions of the player board is annoying.

Like Race for the Galaxy but with a board.  I like it way better than RftG because I could relate to the theme more.

After a single play using the basic corporations, the unique corps were a welcome addition.  I think some are better than others, but it is all about the card draw and trying to get early synergies.  You have to work with what you've got and abandon plans early if the synergies aren't there.  Also, avoid specializing 1 part of the engine, have a few options.

As a game there is nothing terrifically clever or innovative here - it is straight forward, simple to grasp and play.

This game is so good and building your corporation/tableau is so fun, you'll probably spend half the game forgetting to Terraform the planet and just keep boosting your numbers/resources.

Using the drafting variant during the research phase is also very important.  The thought process of whether to get the card you want vs stopping your opponents from getting cards that will really help them adds a very important layer to the game.

Nagyon jó téma, gyönyörű kivitelezés. Alapvetően kártyaközpontú játék, rengeteg különböző, tematikus, majdhogynem tudományos kártyával. A végtelen különböző kártya miatt hatalmas az újrajátszhatóság, és erre jönnek még rá a "faji" képességek, amit még nem is próbáltunk. A kártyák kiegyensúlyozottságát nehéz eldönteni nemhogy egy játék, de valszeg 10 után is. Bizonyára vannak eltérések, ami a draftos variánssal lehet csökkenteni. Nagyszerű - nem is annyira - heavy juró. Az utóbbi idő egyik legjobbja.

RATING: 6.5
For many years I have been strongly against card-driven games that use cards where you target a single opponent while gaining nothing for yourself. Unfortunately, this game has a lot of those cards. Fortunately, you receive so many cards in this game that you could simply discard any of that sort that come your way. However, it would be better if they didn't exist in the first place. Probably comes off as sour grapes given that I lost 16 Green during my first game due to attacks, but even by the end of the rules explanation I knew I wouldn't like this. It's not that it feels mean (I certainly don't care about that), but rather because from a design-theory perspective it's simply a bad mechanic if there are more than two players. The designer should have listened to the Ludology podcast. 

I also think I'd prefer that the cards be separated into eras -- at least a first and second era. It feels kinda silly to get a card on Turn 1 that couldn't possibly be played until the late game. 'Automatic discard' is not an interesting game decision.

Map play didn't seem very interesting either. Limited space, dedicated spaces for specific tiles, and constraining adjacency rules made the board feel a bit lifeless. 

It also needs to be about 1/3 shorter. 

I've read all three of KSR's Mars Trilogy books, so the theme was fun and compelling for me. The sheer volume and variety of cards was nice, too.

Not a very positive first time experience. I won, but I didn't have fun. I found the card mechanics annoying as I didn't get cards that worked together well so my "engine" was essentially non-existent.

Don't understand why such high ratings for the game. It's fine but there's nothing exceptional about it.

Terraforming Mars looks like a (fairly large) boardgame but is really an oversized card game. It is sort of a tableau building or engine building game but the card combinations are actually fairly tame most of the time so it becomes more of an income building game instead. The game is solid but somewhat long for what it provides, and some aspects feel rather unnecessary and tacked on. The "take that" elements, for example, feel to me like they realized "Oh, hey, our game is not very interactive, is it? The positional play on the shared board is largely irrelevant and everybody just micro-manages their own income. Well, there's an easy fix for that..." Luckily, these effects are usually fairly minor. So, yeah, solid but mostly unspectacular.

Mein Verhältnis zum Mars ist massgeblich von Ray Bradburys fantastischen "Mars-Chroniken" geprägt, eines der besten SF-Bücher überhaupt. Die Mars-Chroniken beschreiben die Kolonisierung des roten Planeten in Kurzgeschichtenform analog zur Kolonisierung Amerikas. Die Besiedelung des roten Planeten rennt bei mir also thematisch offene Türen ein und bleibt als ganz normales Euro-Kartenspiel im Raum stehen, das dem überhitzen Hype im Hip-Thema Mars nicht standhält: ein sehr gutes, gängiges Karten-Ausspiel-Spiel mit dem schönen Glückselement des zufälligen Kartenziehens, kombiniert mit überwiegend taktischen Überlegungen à la "Mach das Beste draus!" Das Ganze auch noch Draften? Never ever! Die visuelle Gestaltung ist RTL2: der Mix aus Perry Rhodan in Aldi und billiger Foto-Auffassung aus Bildarchiven Marke Corbis oder Getty verleiht TM den unfreiwilligen Charme von Hobbykeller. Dafür nimmt man TM die wissenschaftliche Grundlage des Chemikers Fryxelius als globale Parameter ab. TM ist jenseits der Hysterie gut genug um im oberen Mittelfeld bestehen zu können. Dort, im Trash seines DIY-Artworks, macht es seinen Job recht unterhaltsam ohne den Spielenobelpreis zu gewinnen. Und ich warte am Grab von Ray Bradbury auf die Reise zu den Lotosessern von der Venus von Stanley G. Weinbaum.

Loved this game. The ONLY reason I am not giving this a 10 is the production quality. Hopefully with its mega popularity, this will get a new version. As it is though, a wonderful game. Played with only 2 players so far, and minus the slog through the rulebook is took the better part of 3 hours. maybe a titch long, but I think next time things will come together more smoothly. Man, I really wish the graphic design would of been just a little bit cleaner, and those dang player mats not so slippery!

A really fun activity.  I assume once one learns the cards it's also a fun game, but in my first play I was just doing my own thing with no real regard for what anyone else was doing.

This game has taken over my local game group like no other.  I like it just fine- in fact more than most games.  But for whatever reason it's turned my "cult of the new" group into a "play Terraforming Mars again" group.

Meh. 

The map offends; it could easily be far more representative.

The physical production is rife with poor choices that make play more difficult than it could be.

But really, the sheer randomness of the cards, and their overwhelming effect on the game renders this at best a novelty that will hopefully pass quickly. And no, drafting doesn't fix the issue; it can actually make it worse.

This game has done for me basically everything that I want a game to do. Engine building, resource management, area control, game end modifiers. Put it this way. You are dealt 4 cards a turn which you must pay to keep the ones you want. YOU WANT EVERY CARD. You weep having to give up cards...... every turn..... AMAZING!

Its an ok game - Theme is good but components are disappointing. One of those each card is unique, which is the most effective way, it of land grab, manage and generate your resources game.

RATING: 7
Liked it! Almost an 8 game. I love the theme and the way that Mars develops in front of your eyes. This game works best with drafting and trying to get the most of your cards without letting your opponents get the most out of theirs. I can't believe the draft is a "variant" suggestion! This game would be - actually - terrible if you had to rely on the cards that you were dealt and that's it. Why would anyone want to play that?! However, I do think the game goes on a little long and takes on too much of an overloaded look with each player having 30 cards are so on the table by the end of the game. (Though admittedly they are all stacked.) I'm not sure how much lasting power the game would have. Nothing felt like you could create a variety of cool combo moves with each game. Just play good cards and hope for good cards later on. Not much strategy with the draft. Players can still get lucky. And maybe the worst part of the game is it's so MPS. Turns come by quick as a 3-player game. I don't think I'd want to play this with 4 and certainly not with 5! But not a whole lot of interaction. Overall, a very good game that might end up being just a good game if I played it too much. But that's never going to happen! I'd play it again!

I have often wanted Race for the Galaxy to go on a bit longer. To me Terraforming Mars is like playing Race for the Galaxy for 4 hours. With more turns and more cards you can really build an amazing engine. 

It is one of the most AP prone games I have played. We played with a draft variant. And the cards you draft you can choose to put in your hand by paying 3. You really have to calculate if you have enough money to play the card you buy and all other cards you play before it. All cards have costs and modify resources so you might be abel to afford playing a card now by using resources instead of money for a type of card and then get the discount for the next card of a type but when you do that you increase the income of another recource....It gets really complicated. And can slow down the game, but I really enjoy it. 

- The theme is not engaging to me. 
- The art work is not great, not as bad as the graphic design, but if I call it ok I am too kind. 
- The board is not interesting to look at and does not offer much strategy or interest to the game. 
- Take that is on a lot of cards and it is not enjoyable at all. Especially since alot of it can be directed to one player if he is the only one who has plants for example. Or if a player is percieved as the leader. If you do something I also get something is way better then to have sabotage and other cards that destroy for other players. 

It is the engine building and huge volume of cards that make this game great. I had no clue how to play it well the first play but want to play it again to play it better. That beeing said I won with a clear margin. I managed to time shifting to get VP at the right time, a mechanic that I also am not a fan of. 

So much I don't like but still a 9 and a game I very much would like to play again. 
With another theme, nicer design, less or no take that and a bit streamlined design and more interesting board I would give it a 10 and I would buy that game.

Grafiki wydają się na pierwszy rzut brzydkie, ale da się do nich przekonać, na pewno tworzą klimat. Gra jest dosyć długa, może zająć nawet 3 godziny, szczególnie jak mocno rozbudowuje się swoje wskaźniki (aż braknie żetonów), ale tak naprawdę to od graczy zależy, jak długo będą przeciągać rozgrywkę. Na początku trudno stwierdzić, w co inwestować, ale praktycznie wszystko przynosi zyski. Negatywna interakcja nie boli aż tak bardzo. Najlepiej od razu grać z draftem.

I really enjoy this game a lot. It sets up quick and you can use Altoids boxes. The play is smooth and the rule book is well documented and with lots of icons to help you get going. You can play it solo and simply play through all the different Corporations (cards that give you starting abilities). The game is not so easy to beat but you seem to always get close. You are stuck a little by the luck of the draw on the cards, but there's an area on the board which allows you to do more. Card synergy is great. You can play a series of cards to give you a domino effect. The goal in the solo game is to get the Temperature, Oxygen, and Ocean (water tiles) to a specific level in order to win. Didn't win a solo game until the third game.

An excellent, thematic Euro with a lot of viable paths to victory, nice art and nice metallic cubes.

Race for the Galaxy on crack. Tons of tablo building with many types of resources and even a spacial element of the planet of mars. The theme stands out here as you start "Terraforming Mars" and things happen on the board as well as allow/disallow cards to be played. I was concerned about some of the take that in the game (and still am) but it seems to be less noticeable when playing with the corporate cards because it's not worth it go for those usually.

I would love to this give a 9 but the production of the boards is just terrible imo and does the game injustice. The fact that everyone has to go spend ~$30 for player trays is just retarded. Stronghold should have just created boards with intents, even if it cost $10-15. I hope they eventually come out with a version that that fixes this.

The only thing keeping this from being one of my all time favorites is the handful of 'take that' cards. Getting one of those early on against you can be devastating. Twice now I've had my faction advantage completely wiped out by an early attack card.

Based on solo plays:
nothing really spectacular. An excel spreadsheet moved up and down with several one-time use cards, several engine building cards etc.
The spatial element on the board... exists, but has no thrill.
Although the game is more than its' parts. The cards are thematic and you always want to ,,just play one more" before the end of the generation - just one more move, one more card, but at the end it all fell flat to me.
And the graphic design... I like it. It's clear and easy to distinguish, but I still would rather prefer to see the cards in the style of the box-cover.

This is pretty close to perfect in my opinion.  The solo game is incredible and just the right length.  The six production tracks, the board, the terraforming requirements - everything works so well together.  This is not only one of the best solo games available, but also the best space-themed game I've played so far. 

Played 2-players.  It's a different feeling from the solo game in that there isn't a set number of generations in the game.  Rather, you have to watch your opponent's actions and gauge when to go for certain things, like Awards or sponsoring Milestones.

Helion = 92 points

Definitely seems to be a solid engine builder, so folks who like to build their game slowly and without much interference will love this. Difficult to get a grasp on this right away, and no doubt will take some time. I suppose every collection needs 1 great engine-game like this. Card art is a bit inconsistent, but the board is fairly functional (nothing special) and easy to read. I echo the common complaint that the player cards that hold the cubes should have been indented, as any bump on the table sends them flying about- very irritating.

Great engine building game with a thematic space colonization feel to it.  Plenty of science themed production and buiding options and chances are you'll rarely play the same way twice.  Variable winning conditions means finding out the winner can be a bit nerve wracking (like Ticket to Ride in that way).  One minor let down is the quality of the components (as cool as those metal looking cubes are, the finish wears off) and the graphic design (weird mixture of live action photography and artist drawings).  Not a light euro game by any means, but great with a small group of gamers.

RATING: 8
Pros:
- All mechanisms are driven by the theme;
- Very well-developed thematics;
- High replayability;
- Very well-balanced non-linear factions (with the non-beginner corporations);
- No dice usage;
- Multiple strategies toward victory.

Cons:
- Slightly complex;
- Little light cubes used as markers is a bad, bad idea;
- Victory Points system for achievements is unbalanced (some are way harder than others and never get completed);
- Oxygen track increases awards VPs too fast;
- Greeneries are too easy to buy;
- If not using corporate Era and non-beginner corporations, the gameplay suffers considerably (not enough choices, turns).

Primarily a card drafting game. Each turn you get 4 draws and can buy cards for 3 bucks each. They vary in power considerably, but over the course of the game, you'll likely get some that can be combined to get your engine going. There are a few pick on the leader cards that allow you to steal resources or hurt another player, which feel imbalanced. There's an early race for certain bonuses that you can buy, as well as a later scoring categories you can buy. It's definitely AP prone until you've learned the game and cards to look for, and even then, I would not play with an AP player. On the plus side, the them shines, and this is a real tinkerer's game. If you like tweaking an engine to try and maximize points, you should enjoy this.

RATING: 7.75
After repeat plays.  My opinion remains unchanged.  It has the same card luck and tableau building feeling of RftG with a protracted play time and less interesting rounds of play. 

August 24th, 2016:

I do enjoy the solo version but it does make so many cards useless. Also the gameplay becomes one dimensional solo but overall an enjoyable experience.

Multiplayer, the game opens up quite a bit and the synergies between cards and the different avenues for vp and resource production are numerous.  It does have a similar card set to something like Race for the Galaxy, but Race for the Galaxy is a WHOLE lot better for these reasons:

1) Terraforming Mars has really bad graphics and art.  The pictures are not engaging and the framing takes away from the theme.  While the numbers and effects are clear, the look of the game overall does not add to the experience, but instead detracts from it.  In Race for the Galaxy,  you can imagine each world/card.. it really draws you in and doesn't feel disconnected from other cards.

2) Race for the Galaxy is streamlined.  Virtually doing all the things this game does with practically only a deck of cards.  No fiddly bits that can be easily knocked around and no cheap player boards.

3) Divergent strategies are more pronounced.  While Terraforming Mars does allow you to make microbes, lichen, livestock, etc  and increase your different production resources and increase the planets two stats for money/vp.. you will most likely need to do at least some of all of that and specialize in one or more.  In Race for the Galaxy it feels more like you are doing your own strategy, like you came up with the combo.  While the cards in both are stat variations, the overall strategy in TM feels more linear, even though it isn't really.

4) Action phase is more engaging.  In TM you are buying and using cards without much concern to others.  Sure, the timing of whether to use one or two actions does have consequences sometimes.  Role selection and guessing/using others roles is far more engaging with other players and tense.  Card play is the bulk of both of these games.  This is important, since in RftG your choices of what card to build are limited by the role, which reduces AP.  In TM, you can build any card, any time, and AP is rampant.


Still, I do enjoy this game but graphic development and overall streamlining might have made this game more than this, which is what it should have been.

Interested in seeing what the upcoming Race for the Galaxy board game will be.
(Jay Tummelson coined it "New Frontiers" at GenCon).

Overall though.. I really like games with lots of UNIQUE cards that work well together with mostly balanced synergies and good theme.  This game succeeds on those levels in spaids!

A sprawling tableau building game that provides you with a huge variety of cards and choices to use terraforming the planet. The fact that everybody is contributing towards the shared endgame condition of terraforming the planet, whilst also building their own personal score creates an interesting tension.

The component quality and graphic design are not the best though. The cheap art puts some people off, but I find it sort of endearing (it mostly seems to consist of CC-licensed images borrowed from the Internet).

I love that you can play cards representing everything from a dust mask or a dish of algae to interplanetary colony stations and moons crashing into the planet.

This game is excellent. There's a lot going on and you need to be able to adapt on the fly as your card draws during research can dictate your actions. My only nitpicks are a fairly low player interaction & some luck in card draws. These are minor. This game deserves the hype & praise it receives.

RATING: 6
EDIT: After my second play I am downgrading its rating by 1. It's still a solid drafting/tableau game, but it's extremely multiplayer solitaire. This time I went for a strategy that didn't play many territories on the board and I just didn't interact with my friends at all during the game. It's nice that there's plenty of viable paths to victory, but after having tried 2 I no longer have much of a desire to play the game more. Without player interaction it's just a game of waiting around and seeing who can get lucky and draft the best point engine. There are plenty of much more interesting, interactive point engine games out there.

It's a solid tableau builder with interesting board interactions, good drafting and great themeing. I like the cards, there's a good mix of different things and interesting combos. The drafting is especially interesting in this game, the cost of keeping cards gives more incentive to hate-draft because you usually don't keep all your cards anyway. There are plenty of viable strategies and I like the cubes being used for all resources, they're pretty and there's so much resource conversion that it would be annoying to have different tokens for all of them. 

The game's biggest weakness is its interaction. There's some competition for milestones and drafting and board placement will of course affect other players, but it just doesn't feel tight. Every player could easily just stake out their own parts of the board and while it sucks to lose out on milestones and awards, there's usually not much you could have done about it and it happens very seldom. The other big interaction portion comes from attacks, which can hit very hard but it's not always obvious who's winning so attacks can sometimes feel very random. I haven't played with the included expansion and I've seen that that adds more interactive cards, but I'm worried that that will cause the game to be too aggressive. Another weakness of the game is its downtime.

Haven't been this impressed with a game in a while. It's very compelling and fun! This game feels like an Eklund, but much easier to digest. The cards are fascinating, and the interactions and synergies are so much fun to find and play with. The research to make this game must have been an astounding task, and I appreciate it. This in an initial rating after only one play with a house modified rule, but boy, do I want to play it again! A sandbox, a thematic romp. Wonderful!

Terra Mystica meets Race for the Galaxy.  Not a terrible game, but I think it needs to be played at 3p to be at its best.

The tile laying interaction is better that way.

Also, the game goes faster as more people are terraforming.  

The game slows down with more than 3 players as the AP really sets in.

After initially reading the rulebook I thought all the different mechanics in this game would clash with each other. Instead they create quite an interesting race for the players, opening up the options for multiple strategies, and allowing players to switch into a different one when needed. The card play is fun and interesting, and making an engine and actually getting to use it through out the game is very satisfying. BUT, a lot of the cards, specially with some "take that" in them feel like the designer needed an easy out for balancing purposes which I think could have been handle slightly different. The quality of the components is fine, but just fine, nothing really feels like they went out of their way to make better. The games graphic design and artwork is terrible. This is the one aspect where I don't understand how the publisher let this style go through. The game feels about 30-45 minutes too long, and I'm surprise this was not brought up during play testing.  I do not think this games deserves all the praise that it is receiving, but I do think there is something here. I would love to see a second edition with some of these issues resolved, the game makes me want to like it, but it also makes it hard for me too.

Decent map. Light box . Poor and light players panels, production values shifting around, You need to put magnetic tray below and use metal markers or use numbered chits to represent production values. Horrible plastic colored players cubes, had to change them with metal ones.

RATING: 8
Components: the board is good, better not talk about the rest
Complex: easy to learn, hard to master
Weight: medium
Players: 3 or 4, but works well also with 1 and 2
Length: less than 2 hours
Mechanics: tile palcement, hand management, engine resource creation....
Decisions: a lot, never are too much, but you have a lot happening here
Opinion: not an awesome game, but one I have liked a lot, and have me thinking in playing soon.
We go for the terraforming on Mars, and, during some generations, we have to get some projects (cards) and get the levels of the planet to something you can live on (Oxygen, water and temperature).
I really liked the idea of the game, everything clicks and flows smoothly. Each generation you draw 4 cards and decide which ones will you keep, if any, but hey, you have to pay for what you keep (really interesting the decision you have between keep cards and spending money you will need). Once you have new cards the action phase, there you can build greeneries, cities, oceans, projects, claim to be the first to achieve something....
Also like how the cards work, you have your own board with 6 different productions, and many times you have to focus on one, or play with all of them, reduce one to increase another, then decrease the latter to increase a third one....
Must say that is a tactical game, you can plan a bit ahead, but not on the long term, you have to adapt to what you get while can focus on something, but be aware that you could not get the appropriate cards (random? no, you can play and win perfectly not depending on the cards, unless you are expecting one specific card... then the game will be random for you).
Liked how everything flows and is implemented, the decision on how to spend my money, where to focus my VP generation, should I go for a big money production or go better for energy, or do that with the steel...
While my games be under that 120 mins frame, is hard to tear down a game

Very interesting game with a good theme.
Note that you have to remove the aggression cards (including 1 defense card) before play. If you play with them, I can't rate it more than 5, as they were really annoying.
(It's just over 10 % of the cards (=23 cards), so it doesn't matter and you suddenly get a brilliant game!)

RATING: 5
(After one play) 
Essentially a multiplayer solitaire, looking for compatible cards to get an 'engine' working to gather resources, to be able to buy/play  better cards....

No significant interaction apart from the occasional stealing/destroying of resources. It's not apparant who is in the lead, trying to figure this out might double or triple the game length. Also no real way to slow down other players.

That being said - it's an okayish game, the other players seemed to be more taken by it than I was. I'll probably end up playing this one again. 

Maybe the drafting variant with the non standard corporation cards might make this game a bit more interesting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I like this game quite a bit, although downtime is harder to stomach here than in other longer games. There's not a lot to think about when it isn't your turn, so if someone is thinking for a while, the game can drag. I also don't care for the take that cards, which seem out of place. Other than that, I really like the game, and it's especially good solo.

I'd rate this a 10 for the solitaire game and a 7 for multiplayer, so 9 seems appropriate, considering the solo game is what I play most often.

Received 8/22/16

Played first solo game. Rating based on that one solo play. I typically do not like solo games. I think this is one I will break out to play solo more often. Lost this first game as I did not complete terraforming. Ended with 74 VP's.

4P played on 8/27, tense game, mild take that, eager to play more.

RATING: 7.5
OK, I get it. After finally being taught the game right and playing it to completion, I can see why people like this. I had a lot of fun during my play. But I still have my reservations. I don't like the use of research cubes and the player boards are flimsy. I think that your starting corporation has an overwhelming effect on your strategy. I would like a bit more open sandbox of choices. Also, I don't like how many cards you have to lay on the table when all is said and done. Still, my rating reflects a game that I would consider buying if the price is right (or if they make a deluxe version), but for now, I'm content playing other players copies. There's nothing here that I'm chomping at the bit to get back to the table ASAP.

One play, four players. I need to play it again with a better idea of strategy to see if there's any competitive bite to it, but this initial play felt like the pressure was not in the time, actions or money, but rather in drawing useful cards.

Played once with intro corporations and no drafting. It was fun, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I was hoping. Definitely going to give it another shot with different corporations and using the drafting variant to see if that makes it better. Not a bad game, but as hyped as it was, I was expecting to enjoy it more.

Terraforming Mars was a pleasant surprise. This is rapidly becoming one of my favorite games of all time, the lack of being able to create a long term strategy is offset by the spontaneity and having to adapt to the cards and changing map.  My wife really enjoys it!

This game reminds me a lot of Race for the Galaxy, a game I love dearly. 

Of the two it looks to be a little more adherent to the setting, with a struggling humanity in planet prone to natural disasters. 

All in all I enjoyed my first game even if I believe there is a distinct luck of the draw, and playing a certain combo strategy with the relevant scoring cards looks nigh unbeatable! 

Future plays will tell if my starting hunch has merit or not.

RATING: 8
I really love this game right now even though it has some problems. Terraforming Mars feels like a puzzle. Sometimes there are clearly right and wrong choices, sometimes you have to just do the math and figure out which cards you want to play. And I like that. In the earlier turns everything is a lot more open ended and it's about trying to find a strategy and/or making the most out of the cards that you have. This is why I like the corporation cards; they give you a direction but don't necessarily force you down that path. Later on is when you try to focus on your gameplan, maximize the points you can get and the game feels more solvable. 

The problem with Terraforming Mars is that, in my opinion, it has to be played a certain way too shine. The box says it plays 1-5 players but I would only recommend playing this game with either 3 or 4 people. The Corporate Era is a must. Drafting is a must as well, it gives you more options and reduces the luck of the draw. 
Other issues mostly have to do with the components. There is no insert, the art on the cards can vary in quality and tone and the player mats are kinda cheap. One wrong move and the cubes will slide all over the place. 

Despite this I've played a lot of Terraforming Mars and I'm looking forward to playing it some more.

Edit: this is the sleeper hit of 2016. 

Further edit: Game of the Year.

Scythe is the hyped hit of the year; SeaFall is the genre-breaking hit of the year; Terraforming Mars is otherwise the most unexpected winner. Every medium-to-heavyweight gamer should own it.

An exquisite resource-management, engine-building game, with a compelling theme and a satisfying level of production. The cards are colorful and a joy to look at. The iconography makes sense. The board is clear.

Overall, the only things I want are (a) more cards (expansion!) and (b) to play the other side of Mars (expansion!).

Very high replayability.

I heard of this game from seeing in "The Hotness" section of BGG and the occasional thread on Reddit and I knew the hype around it.  From seeing the board and its components, it felt like another Terra Mystica which I own and love. I wasn't really ready to spend money on buying another game like this but I was willing to play it and it finally happened.

When my friend showed up to our monthly board game night with this, the whole group wanted to try it.  Man was I not let down, this game does live up to the hype!  The theme is strong, it felt like I would imagine terraforming a planet and the game does it well.  Some cards can only be played when a certain temperature or oxygen level has or has not been reached which make a lot of sense in the game play and theme.  All in all, it felt like a very well thought out game and even though I lost miserably I'm really looking forward to play this game soon.

RATING: 9
Interesting and thematic eurogame that mashes together many commonly seen mechanisms. 

Primarily a card-driven game, though there's also tile placement, resource management, and engine building.

The game gets shorter (not necessarily quicker) with more players, which gives it a bit of tension, as you try to get your card and resource production engine working before your opponents close out the game (maxing oxygen, oceans, and temperature parameters).

I find the solo-variant quite good, as you race to max the 3 parameters within a set number of turns.  

Components-wise, the board looks great and the metallic cubes look "cool".  The card art is sort of a mixed bag, though isn't really an issue.  I will agree with the masses and say that the player boards can sometimes be problematic.  The plastic cubes are quite slick and can be bumped off of their tracks easily, leaving you wondering where they came from.

Overall, a very solid game.  Always enjoy playing this with the group or solo, and can't wait for expansions. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Positives: Great game + theme.
Negatives:
All the game components feel cheap (Compared to a FFG game or Scythe). The box is flimsy. The cards are die cut - off centre - so badly that you can see the edge of the card beside it on one side and the edge trimmed away on the other. The tokens tear if you are not careful when punching them out of the sheet. The player cubes have one rough edge and the resource cubes have chipped pink corners on many of them. Even the game board when folded is quite a bit smaller than the box.
The art/graphic design on the cards and player mats is not consistent with the awesomeness of the box art/style.

Interesting, but feels more like a prototype than finished game.  The art was pretty atrocious, the graphic design was awful with colors and distinguishing between different cards and actions.  Having part of what you do on the top of the card and part on the bottom was unnecessarily confusing.  The icons in the top right were a positive, though, until I found out that the top right icons on the red cards don't count even though they are same size, shape and location.  

I didn't really like how cards could target players, but generic actions could not.  I am not a fan of direct interaction being a part of a game, but then only available through random draw(Pick all or no direct interaction- this is not where hybrid is a good thing).  I will play it again; the scoring was difficult to pick up the first play.  My favorite part was the endgame conditions running out- reminded me of Chicago Express.

Finally, just saw the price.  It is not worth that.  It is a $50 game until they fix the bugs clean up the graphic design.

Big hype, boring gameplay.
Every owner in my gaming groups has now sold his copy. 
After a couple of more tries, we came to the final conclusion that its not worth any more time. Sitting at the table for hours looking silently at your cards, no communication/real interaction with other players, unbalanced cards, cheap game components,etc.

If Terraforming Mars had better production values, it would be a 10. It was my #2 game of 2016 and in any other year (i.e. a year in which my #1 game ((Scythe)) was released) would have been best of the year. 

It has certainly outdone all the other games in my collection for number of plays, and is neck & neck with my #1. I can play this game over and over again; even though I know I'll get the expansions as soon as they are available, I feel like I could play this game indefinitely without anything new being added to it, and it wouldn't get stale.

Ausgezeichnetes Spiel: elegant designed, variantenreich, starkes Thema. Wunderbare Mischung aus Engine-Builder und Rennspiel. Langfristige Planung ist ebenso wichtig wie das Erkennen kurzfristiger Gelegenheiten. Besonders gut gefallen mir die vielen Wege zum Sieg die es gibt: Städte- und Waldbau, Tierentwicklung, Weltraumereignisse und Titan, Hausbau über Stahl, Meilensteine und und und. Dazu eine aufgeräumte Regel ohne große Ausnahmen oder schrägen Sonderfällen. 

Für 10/10 reicht es trotzdem nicht, denn das Material ist angesichts eines Preises von 60€ suboptimal: die Playercubes sind nicht plan und verrutschen sehr leicht, die Ressourcencubes stoßen sich recht schnell ab. Auch die Spieldauer ist mit 2.5h an der oberen Grenze.

Trotzdem: exzellentes Spiel und der beste Titel im Herbst 2016.

Nachtrag: Habe die Bewertung nach fast 20 Spielen nun doch auf 10 Punkte gehoben denn mittlerweile hat sich gezeigt, *wie* gute die Mischung aus taktisch kurzfristigen Entscheidungen und langer strategischer Linie in TM funktioniert. Die Variante mit Karten-Drafting erlaubt es wirklich, sich eine Plan zurecht zu legen und diesen dann durchzuziehen. Das Spiel zeigt dabei eine enorme Belastbarkeit hinsichtlich der unterschiedlichen Spielweisen. Ich habe mittlerweile Partien erlebt, in denen zB Spieler die massiv auf Waldbau spielten und solche die fast ohne auskamen, am Ende genau 1 Punkt auseinander waren.  Und das bei einem Spiel, das 100% ohne Catchup. Mechanismen auskommt. Grandios

Neues Fazit: Bestes anspruchsvolles Spiel 2016.

I am not as enthralled in this as others. An 'ok' game, but in the three games I've played they have taken longer than I want to be playing this game..

This is a great game.  There is a lot of variation during the game, and games play out in different ways depending on the cards drawn/chose/played.  The component quality is good and bad.  I really like the look and feel, but some components are cheap, and some are hard to PHYSICALLY manage, though this does not detract from the actual QUALITY of the game ITSELF.

Very versatile game, very dynamic. Love it.
Farming your company into victory, the duality of improving your productions and playing the board, is really good.
Also, you do a lot on your own, but it never gets dull?: you dont have a lot interaction between players, but on the same time, its interesting to monitor their progress.

Played 1 time and halfway through it was apparent that I would be last or or second last and then there was still another 2 hours left. Will give 1 more try to see of it gets any better. 

Component quaility is dreadful. I mean not a single city was cut to center and when even cubes made of plastic isn't a perfect cube. 

Don't get me started on the playerboard and resource cubes.

Second play. Not much change. 
No income cards or mines for the first 5 rounds. So was basically left for dead after that. And then the waiting game started. 

Will give it 1 last try. If nothing changes this will go down even further I will pass it over for pretty much anything.

3 plays done. So far only feel like a Race for the Galaxy with 4 time longer gameplay and I rather still play 4 straigh games of Race.

Amazing, well designed game. There is ONE thing that threw me off when I opened the box: the graphic design is very amateur. Being a graphic designer myself I always get excited when I see pieces like Mechs VS Minions, Tiny Epic Quest and others with a thought out, well planned graphic design. Typography in this whole set is horrible. The cards are barely readable, color contrast is poorly chosen and they were made to value the photograph that is portrayed in them. This could have been done so much better.

A perfectly pleasant multiplayer solitaire tableau-builder, the pointless and grotesquely arbitrary take-that attacks notwithstanding.

I played this with my buds last night. The theme is absolutely amazing. I actually cared WHY a card did what it did. The art is also great.

But... 

Player interaction is minimal. I felt like I was playing Catan with the passive-aggressive land grab race, which really only came into focus towards the end of the game. On the other hand there are Munchkin style take-that mechanisms that are VERY aggressive and felt out of place in an otherwise relatively peaceful game. 

Finally, the cards felt very imbalanced and luck based. I suspect drafting would reduce this, but would also add length to what ended up being a 5 hour game! 

But I'll try it again.

A very long game with a fair amount of luck involved, where some cards seem to be stronger than others. It's essentially a pure drafting game with a board to show what happens.

Nevertheless, this game if fun. Even though I would like it more if it wouldn't take as long as it does (never even came close to finish this in 90 mins), I definitely prefer the draft option, as you just have so much more control.

Good game, no question about that, but the hype is (as usual) out of control.

Fun to play and a great theme.  From my one play, it feels a little low on player interaction -- with the exception of some "take that" cards, which are a type of interaction I don't like.  I expect playing with the drafting variant would make a HUGE difference in the strategic depth of the game.

I was highly impressed with my single play of this game and very much look forward to playing again. The theme is appealing to me as a sci-fi fan in general, but this has a much more "serious" feel than games like Cosmic Encounter, Alien Frontiers, or Starfarers. In fact, by its very nature, many of the mechanics are based on real-life anticipated requirements to terraform Mars. Certainly there are things you can do that border on flights of fancy, but everything is at least plausible. 

I was somewhat reminded of Agricola in how the cards are used. The synergies with each other and with your starting player power will provide opportunities to be very efficient with your point scoring, but they do not railroad you into doing certain things either. You will want to do lots of different things, but will be limited by the resources/money that you have, rather than by the number of "workers". 

Terraforming Mars is interactive without being cutthroat, engine-building without rote accounting, and science-based without being afraid to dream big. Those aspects are all very appealing to me. This one is a winner.

Not much interaction beyond 'take-that' cards which just reduce 'x' on another player and slow the game down even more than it already is. Variable art quality and so-so components.

not a bad game. not a good one.

complexity of victory points make very difficult to read who is winning.

you play alone, except arbitrary (and random, devastating) hosing.

I tend to love long games, this one is. but, it's essentially long because you wait for your turn.

Entirely engrossing. So many variables and play styles that every game feels fresh. Choices are hard and can lead to a bit of analysis paralysis, but raking in cubes from a well-executed strategy is pure bliss and well worth the patience. Not exactly the kind of game I often get to put on the table (it generally lasts longer than planned, especially when teaching others), but I'm giddy every time I have the chance to dive in.

After three plays I am very impressed with this game. The cards and engine building remind me of Innovation, but less chaotic and disruptive, and with a strong Euro feel. It keeps my excitement and interest and moves along quickly enough that I don't feel much in the way of downtime. Even if it's not my turn, I'm plotting and watching what the other players are doing. And with all those cards and corporations and the myriad strategies and counter-strategies they allow, none of the games have followed the same path, and I've pursued a different strategy each time (finally winning in my third game). This is the only game I want to play right now!

I . can't . buy that.  Even I, a complete amateur in design, would do much better.  It's ugly.  Yes I am tempted because it seems that it's a very good game.

Played a few times now.  I like it but don't love it.  The card play is a little random with the huge deck, meaning you can't guarantee you will see the cards you need for your intended strategy.  I didn't like that factor in RftG which plays in 20 mins, it's worse here.  However, it is an intricate enough Euro that you can find alternative routes.  Are they actually viable in terms of potentially winning the game?  I don't have enough experience to say.  If the flexibility bears out in the long term, this will be an all time classic.  We'll see.

Though the game has an interesting fresh theme but you can only feel it if you read the card names and the text in the bottom of the cards. It is a great tableu building game but it is way too solitaire for my taste. Really hard to follow the other players points. In a game where the game ends after the three conditions are met cooperativly but in the end the competitive side wins i believe it is a bad design. How do i know if i should finish the game that i will win in the end where i don't know my and the opponents exact points? I like to have the option of players chooing the endgame bonus scorings. After all i had terrible experience playing this so i don't want to play it again ever. Such an awful solitaire and boring game. Im wondering how can be that such a bad is in the top10 rated tabletop games?

Terraforming Mars is a thematic engine building game focused on future efforts to colonize Mars and to make it Earth habitable.

Players represent corporations trying radically change Martian conditions of temperature, moisture/surface water and amospheric oxygen levels.

Funds are granted them based on their success in terraforming efforts (VPs), and this resource also can be increased, along with other basic resources needed.

All efforts to reshape Mars are measured on a common board- while it isn't worker placement per se, other players can beat you to meeting desired goals.

Game end conditions at all player counts are the same: complete the tracks marking terraforming goals on the Red Planet.

All this makes for a very tasty mix of race/tableau building game, with low to moderate interaction and a solid theme.

Great new game- it has been on and off my radar since I first noted it, and I'm glad I picked it up.

RATING: 9
One of my now favorite games.  Excellent replayability, and one of those rare games that I want to immediately replay after finishing a game.  One gripe I have is that player tokens can shift on the player mats, but Broken Token's insert solved that.

The solo version of this game is quite the puzzle, especially when first learning.  I initially found winning impossible, but after a few rounds got the hang of it and win more than lose, and play for high score.  

Excellent game design, and with a huge stack of cards this game finds itself on the table quite a bit.  Here's looking forward to a "deluxe" version that upgrades the components (I can dream, can't I?).

I really wanted to experience what everyone was buzzing about.  I found a completely tedious experience is all that there was to offer.  The game is almost completely solitaire.  There are random sprinkles of minimal interaction, but they stick out as the exception.  It is more solitaire than worker placement - imagine worker placement where everyone has their own board for worker actions.  There are some shared tracks and a board - these have no real impact.  You just choose the optimal available space and the board never causes you to change your tempo to grab some much needed space.

I'm surprised after two plays how balanced this game is.  Any strategy can be a viable one and a close race.  It's also nice that once your engine finally gets rolling, you'll most likely still have a half-hour to stoke and enjoy it.  My rating could go higher because this game DEMANDS further playthroughs. Stay tuned.

RATING: 1
First 2 games I really like this game because it has one of the best themes mankind cam ever think. The content of this game and all possibilities are impossible. And that is the point. Every turn you buy more and more cards and it never have a stop so every turn it s harder to orientate what you have. Another point is you must every turn in the middle of the game collect 48 cubes of gold 7 cubes of iron 9 cubes of titanium 13 plant tokens and 6 energy... Just to much to move with everything so the counting is so annoying I want to turn the table instead of playing 2 cards and again moving with even more components. In 2 player it never has an end. To end you must finish 3 tracks but to affect them gives you only 1 victory point. So much often we played cards that ensure us at least 2 victory points.... So you play it until you get bored and than you finaly complete everything that mars needs to invite peoples. And you find out you lose by 2 points exactly because you wanted to finish the game and oponent just continue earning more points for doing more unimportant things to complete the game.

First play impressions: 
Rulebook is text-heavy but clear.  A bit difficult the first round but after that it was very clear and straightforward how to play.  Card text is some of the most clear and precise I've seen.  Use of the 1/5/10 resource cubes is actually simple and elegant and removes the need for a ton of bits.

2-player was long - 2.5 hours.  I imagine we can get it down to 2 hours but probably not less.  I wish the handling of the end-game conditions were a bit more ... elegant.  It just ends whenever it ends, with more of a whimper than a shout - the least epic part of the game actually.

The components - rule book actually fell apart first game.  Those play mats are as bad as everyone says.  The card art - meh, whatever.

We liked it and were definitely engaged enough to play again but it would really benefit from a better arc and tighter play.    

Second Play: Improved our impression and increased to 8.  Used the variant to speed up progression, but since we were more aware of the strategy and used card drafting, it still took 2.5 hours.  Simply speeding up the game made the ending a bit tighter as we had less choice of when to end the game.

Great game. Even after multiple plays, different strategies can still win as long as they're executed well. The game uses card deck mechanics, but luck tends to be mitigated by adjusting well to your draws. Only knock on this game is the production quality. Very thin cardboard used throughout, and only plastic cubes as counters. Terraforming the gameboard is satisfying enough to make up for it though, as is dropping a "beam from a thorium asteroid".

Theme drew me to this game when the first teaser images went up on FryxGames' website.  By the time I got my copy in September of 2016, my hype meter was off the charts.  I can safely say, this game met my expectations and then some. 

It as an excellent fusion of theme and mechanics.  It captures a sense of eagerness and racing against the other players as we perform all manner of actions from science fiction and science fact.  In one game, I was carefully cultivating plants and building cities.  In another, I was gleefully smashing asteroids into the planet and deploying space mirrors to increase my energy budget.  The game is intimidating at first glance with all the cubes, tiles and cards, but players quickly learn it is quite simple mechanically and find a steady groove pretty easily.  I keep thinking about the games I have played and the potential in future games, which is always a good sign for the longevity of a game.

Above all, though, it's the strong theme that captures my imagination.  If you are at all intrigued by the concept of this game, you should certainly give it a try.  You won't regret it.

RATING: 6.99
It has a similar thematic feel to Roll for the Galaxy in that you are building cards which grant benefits, there are two forms of additional currency related to building cards.

It appears more interactive because there is a board [Mars] that everyone is building tiles on. It looks like this would prevent the game from being a personal solitaire game, but it actually does not. You spend 90% of your time staring at your cube generating board and set of drafted cards. Sometimes turn order plays a huge part in who accomplishes what first, and sure, looking at what other people draft can affect what you should [hate] draft. But er no I amend my previous viewing; Puerto Rico feels far more interactive with its role selection than anything in Terraforming Mars.

Drafting is definitely the way to play this game--that way someone can win because of the draft, not because they "got lucky" drawing cards. However the first time a new player plays, drafting may be a bit counter-productive. Hard to know what is "valuable" and what you should not draft as a new player doesn't know what cards exist. ALL of the cards have different text. To actually keep the card in your hand [after drafting], you have to pay 3money/card, so you can't keep everything. 

There are three end-game timers; after all of them are completed, the game end is triggered: building oceans, temperature, and oxygen levels. These tracks only advance and some cards have the requirement that "oxygen level must be 4% or less" or "temperature must be 4 degrees or warmer" which puts this timing element into play as well.

Lots of neat sciency stuff.
Weird stock art on the cards that wildly differs in quality.
Not the kind of game I would pick for spending 2 hours of time on, but if everyone else REALLY wanted to play this I would play it.

A good example of what Eurogames have turned into in recent years. Essentially you draw cards and pay to put them into tableau, hoping to find little synergies that will get you ahead.

It's competent, but honestly, there's nothing here that Race for the Galaxy wasn't doing more elegantly a decade ago.

This is a truly outstanding game and deserves all the praise it is getting. The depth and variety of strategy is immense and the designers really knew how to make it all come together for a great experience. The only downside is the game playing time, with new players you need to expect a four player game to last a good 3 to 5 hours, so make sure you allocate enough time for it. There is a faster variant if you remove some of the cards, but I've not tried that yet. If you have a free afternoon and some friends who like some heavier strategy/economy, get them to come to mars!

A side note - this game is improved by about 100% by purchasing some accessories, specifically the overlays or holders for the materials sheets. The cubes have a habit of going everywhere and then you suddenly don't know what your production is, so I highly recommending spending a little extra money on 5 overlays from one of the various producers out there to make the game hugely easier to play.

Outstanding game.  There are a lot of choices and paths to explore, but turns flow quickly.  Mechanics make sense and are easy to teach.  Between asymmetric corporation abilities, cards, goals, and achievements, this game has immense replayability.

Una miriade di carte da poter acquistare, giocare e gestire, in un labirintico viaggio alla ricerca della miglior "combo". Sostanzialmente un solitario, con il vincolo di dover sottostare ad un draft di carte ad ogni giro, per poi restare lì in attesa che anche gli altri facciano la propria mossa.

RATING: 10
Terraforming Mars gameplay is so solid and well balanced that it makes up in spades for the terribly low quality components, but those same components also serve as a reminder of how this game was motivated by a great design idea despite the low budget. An example of what Kickstarter is really about, not of the likes of the CMON petulant marketing and gimmicks. The game has endless replayability and even though you will inevitably prefer certain cards to others, you will never win by trying to force a certain strategy, rather, it's all about adaptability. In this game, wins whoever will make the most of the cards given to him and plays with the most efficiency. No game yet has given me a more rewarding feeling of seeing your engine build and grow. The pace of the game is perfect and the game ending triggers are there for all to see and give you a clear idea of when the game will likely come to a close which avoids sudden, anti-climatic game endings of the likes of Scythe or Viticulture. The player interaction is just enough and it's not too aggressive, many cards allow to choose wether to remove certain resources or not and the map tile placement provides for solid interaction and requires you to adapt your strategy based on others decisions.

RATING: 6
Played a total of 3 times. Overall a fun game that seems a bit finicky. Parts are poor for the hefty price. Biggest complaint is that while you have all these cards and standard actions there aren't really that many decisions you can make. Your hand is usually filled with crap and some good cards. Play time is a little long for what it is. I wouldn't suggest anyone to buy it but I wouldn't turn down a game if there wasn't something else I'd rather play. Solid.

Never been more disappointed after opening a box than with this one...  After reading nothing but good reviews on gameplay, I was expecting the finish of the game to live up to it too.
Alas... a big box filled with a lot of air, a gameboard that is smaller than the base of the box, lots of cards but nothing to put them in once they're unpacked, lots of shiny tokens of which the metallic paint comes of at the corners, player mats that are as flats as the 16th century earth which means that you loose all track if someone accidently hits the table.
So NO insert at all!  Just throw everything ad random into the box when done playing.  Don't bother storing you box upright, on the side or even topsy turvy 'cause it won't matter: it'll be a mess anyway.
Would a simple piece of plastic insert, really have costed that much?
For someone who cares a lot for the wellbeing of his games; either prepare yourself to throw some extra dough at an insert for this or better not buy it at all (in this version that is).

I have played 3 games with 3, 2, and 5 players.  I love the presentation here: game board design, shiny cubes, and the awesome cards.  The game has powerful theme - I feel like we are all leading corporations implementing terraforming projects.  The card play is very compelling with very interesting effects to the game state, cool flavor text, and awesome combo opportunities.  Playing Terraforming Mars reminds me a lot of Race for the Galaxy, one of my favorite games.  I will criticize my new cardboard darling:  This game takes a little bit longer in time to play than I would otherwise prefer and I am suspicious about the strategy aspect of the game:  I am making many choices, so many different actions I can do.  How balanced are the sundry paths to victory for this game going to feel after many plays?  How much of a factor does the randomness of drawing from so many cards play upon my chances of winning?  I am still learning the finer points of the game.  I cant help feeling like I am playing a drawn out, pretty, attractive version of Race for the Galaxy.  I get a bunch of cards and I have to choose which to play and which to throw away and which sequence to play the cards.  Building an efficient engine - how much of it is clever and how much of it is random?  I am looking forward to deeper examination of this compelling game.  I probably would avoid playing with the full 5 player complement unless all of them were very eager to play and we have a lot of time.

Played again with 5 -- There is very fertile ground in this set of cards to try to win with many different strategies.  We played with drafting every round.  That improves the game quite a bit.  Don't play without drafting :) I love this game, but I would like it even more if it was a little bit shorter in time elapsed.

This game is overhyped. Yes, it is a strategic, semi-coop, board card game with intelligent, realistic scenography and background story, but the game has three major flaws. It is too much luck-dependent for such a long strategic gameplay, because of too many cards even with card drafting not manageable. Secondly, there is almost no interaction between players, it is that everyone is building something for themselves and you can only destroy something from others with less effect. And the biggest flaw is the price-performance ratio, which is far too low for the offered quality of the game material.
 
To stay fair, I had to play this game again.

Very pretty theme, but it misses a lot of opportunities. The color scheme and overall design could be much more thematic than it is. It gets a bump for the wonderful choice of resource cubes. I've never enjoyed a game currency more, and I love that the cubes are used to represent denominations of everything in the game. I also love that the cube theme caries through the player tokens, resources, and the sugar cubes that show progress.

Believe the hype! This is a wonderful game. Yes, it takes a few hours, but they don't drag unless you're watching other people play it. It took me a few rounds to nail down the system, and a few games to realize more optimal strategies. There are a lot of possibilities, and there are so many fun little mechanics that may come up through the cards.

Nov16:

I respect it, but there is way too much downtime to hold my interest.

Definitely need to draft the cards or the power of luck is uncomfortably high.

So much of the decision space is in what cards to keep, but so much of the time is then playing out the actions (mostly driven by the cards you kept).  The spatial reasoning on the board is pretty weak as well.

I will give it that there appear to authentically be multiple paths to victory, and the different player powers is nice.

Still, would almost always rather play Race for the Galaxy...

My high enjoyment of this game surprised me.  Very solid economic game.  Love the card play.  Invokes the feeling of transforming mars while playing.  Components are top notch.  It meshes a few mechanics into a seamless and fun experience.  One of those games where you feel pretty good about how you are doing even when you lose (Ala Castles of Burgundy).  Do not get me wrong, the game is nothing like Castles, other than the feeling you are doing good all throughout the game.  I guess what I am saying is, I find it an enjoyable experience, even if I am losing.

RATING: 4
Have to agree with the more critical reviews here. This game is nearly unplayable without drafting. The card-driven production system can prospectively set up an unstoppable engine (be it your own or someone else's) from the beginning and suck the life out of the game...get your luck out of my euros. Precious little feels satisfying, Much too much feels frustrating.

The lack of consistency of the art and the clashing of the photographs, some of which are laughably bad, just annoys me. Much ado has been made about those awful player boards already and the lack of any immersive resource components.

You can see the attempt made to balance out the engine building and the more ameritrash "take that" player conflict, but nothing really adds up. You can mess with your direct neighbor with effective actions from position, maybe. Much more often you are ignoring them because any missed opportunity to build *your engine* is fatal. Recovery is a struggle. Boxed out of projects that play to your corporation? Suffer as you try in vain to branch out to some project you will never draw another card to synergize with again or complete a laughably inefficient standard project.

I repeat, FRUSTRATING. Frustrating to scramble from behind, and frustrating to *win* if you have a cheese factory going.

I know I am hating hard here, but the game is not awful (as long as it is played with veteran eurogamers), it is just one of the biggest disappointments I have experienced in recent history. Irks me that this game would even be mentioned in the same sentence as Scythe, let alone know that the consensus is that people think *that this is better*. Ugh, so salty.

Traded it.

(Edit: Rating revised down for my lack of desire to see this on the table again and as a counter-rating. Hey, at least I admit it.)

I have owned this game for 4 days now, and between my friends and I it has been played 8 times. Yeah, it's that fun. Each game does take awhile though, so I feel like you have to play with people who can really sit and play longer games without issue. I think it plays best with 4, but have also played with 5 and it wasn't too much slower. Basically the less players the more you as an individual get to do, towards terraform mars. Haven't tried single player, but playing with 4 has been a solid experience. Playing with 3 is also fun, feeling a bit more fast paced.

In terms of build quality the board is great. The pieces for currency (gold silver bronze cubes) seem a little cheap, as the corners started to chip after our first game, but otherwise they're fine. The player mats also work perfectly fine, contrary to what some people might say about needing an overlay or something of that sort. If your group is careful and you warn everyone about knocking over their player mats, you probably wont have any problems. Knocking player boards and messing up production cubes was my biggest worry when playing, but I found that in all 8 of my games I've had 0 problems with friends knocking their stuff around. That being said, if you have the extra money lying around, the acrylic overlays being sold on etsy and etc are super nice, and would make a nice addition.

Overall this is probably one of the best board games I've played to date, and would recommend to anyone who can take longer games. Every person I've played it with so far has loved it.

This game is much better than I thought on first try. I tried my first game 2 p Solo and it took forever, as I was just learning the game, a whole afternoon. However after another game of solo under my belt I felt ready to introduce it to my wife. I thought she would hate it and she didn’t! I think she liked getting all the gold every turn the most :). I finally played a nice quick solo play just yesterday and it went faster than I remember. Any game that goes quick and keeps my focus for 1 hr + is great in my book. I will be keeping track of scores and see how high I can get.

Juego de gestión de recursos ambientado en el desarrollo del planeta Marte.

Cada jugador resulta ser una corporación que recibe una serie de proyectos (cartas) que deberá adquirir pagando dinero para conservar en mano y construir posteriormente.

Una vez construidos algunos de estos proyectos tendrán efecto una única vez, otros representarán edificios que deberá colocar sobre la superficie de Marte (los menos) otros representarán "mejoras tecnologías", el caso es que estos proyectos irán combando entre sí potenciando las acciones del jugador durante del turno que realmente son muy pocas, aquí la chicha está en las cartas y en como gestionar los recursos. Por otro lado, para que no sea solo mirarse cada uno lo suyo, las cartas podrán afectar al jugador que la pone en marcha o al resto (según el tipo)

Además el juego te propone varios métodos adicionales de puntación basados en llegar el primero a unos objetivos que previamente han sido seleccionados por los usuarios, no estando disponibles todos, sino los que los jugadores compran, haciendo aqui dos diferencias entre unos de tipo lo compro y es para mi y otros que son del tipo los compro y al final del juego el que más tenga de esto se lleva los puntos.

RATING: 9
Amazing, this game is amazing. The theme of the game is that every player takes control of one of the corporations that arrive in Mars at the same time (what a coincidence!) with the objective of terraforming Mars (as the name already indicates, well done Javi). The final objective of the game is, generation after generation, which is represented by every turn (how cool is that?), to improve the live conditions of the planet, which is done when the temperature gets to 8ºC, the oxygen percentage gets to 14% and the nine ocean tiles are in play. One those 3 conditions are fulfilled, the current round is considered as the last one. The players are allowed to continue playing as if a normal turn, but the end means the end of the game. The player with most terraforming points, wins the game.
The core of the game are the cards, which is a extremely valuable asset. They game uses a mechanic that it works perfectly, that consists on, every turn, the players take four cards from the pile, and they have to decide how many of those are going to keep in hand (0-4), but you have to pay 3 credits (MEuros), so you have to sacrifice something. And, at the end of the game be aware that you will run low on cards. 
Those cards are highly thematic, I am not completely sure if there are many duplicated cards, but the feeling is that every card is unique, there are combos that can be achieved, there are restrictions for playing certain type of cards, for instance, you cannot put big animals over the surface of the planet until a certain temperature has been achieved... it works, it just makes sense, it is very fun, you want to build/pay every single card that comes into hand but you do not have that many resources
The second interesting mechanic is the tile allocation on the board. Basically, 3 types of tiles can be put on the table: cities, forests and oceans. There are other unique locations that are related to cards that are explained on the card. Every tile has its advantages, its way of providing points and the way of allocating, for instance, you cannot put 2 cities together, setting a forest increases the oxygen percentage, putting a tile beside an ocean provides 2 credits...
Regarding the game itself, the best of it are the cubes. They come with a set of gorgeous cubes for the economics, I don't now the game is amazing, so many things...
But the best is, when the game is finished, you don't feel that it has been a long game and you want to play more, you want to try other combos, try to go more into factories, or biological research, or asteroids... so much fun!
Positive:
1. Very fun
2. The amount of unique cards
3. How thematic it is
4. The cubes
5. Many strategies are possible
6. The game seems to be very well balanced
Negative:
1. I would not play with more than 3 players. The duration of the game should be always more or less the same, but with 4 or 5 players you will not have time to develop a complete industrial structure
2. The player boards. If you have not bought the small wooden board that had the squares carved and that immobilize perfectly the cubes, you have to be very careful not kicking the table or whatever, because you can lose track of the production

Excellent mid-weight euro. Lots of interesting decisions, within a nicely presented theme. Seems to move along nicely, even though there are many aspects to track and analyse. Rewards good strategic thinking, complementary resource management and keeping an eye on what others are doing. Interactive without getting too deep into 'take-that' territory. The extensive use of cubes seems initially excessive but works well, provided no one bumps the table too hard. A very enjoyable game, with mechanisms and a large card deck supporting very good replayability. Deserves its accolades.

This game is fine, but not very exciting. All of the card effects are pretty generic and there's no real interesting twist in the game. In some sense I'd call this one of the more generic cube pusher games I've played. I also found the decisions mostly felt too easy. But the theme is fun and the cards all have nice art and do what you'd expect them to do, and so the game is probably worth playing once to just see how everything comes together. But beyond that I didn't really see much of a game.

Fantastic game, simple rules while still being deep and interesting. I fear that if i play it too much however that it will grow stale, so I can't give it a higher rating. The coorporations are a must even for a first play. 

I don't use the negative cards at all, they seem to be there for the sake of having interaction without actually adding anything interesting to the game.

The component quality is crap, the cubes easily slide off your player board if you're not careful, and the resource cubes will be chipped after one play.

RATING: 9
Terraforming Mars is a great game that seems to appeal to everyone.  Its theme is well implemented and the art and the components really make it live.  The game mechanics also work well.  Basically you start with a hand of cards and some income and your goal is to earn victory points by improving the three critical terraforming parameters of open water, temperature, and oxygen content.  You can also get victory points by playing cards that provide some kind of benefit to Mars (and yourself).  Your goal is to build up an engine, accumulating cards that provide powerful synergies and increasing your income of various important resources, while racing to accumulate victory points.  There are many routes to victory and you need to consider all of them since you are constrained by the cards coming into your hand.  You also have to constantly weigh spending money to keep more cards versus spending money to play the cards you already have.  This is a game of shiny where all the cards are great and you are always slavering to get the newest one out.  At the same time there is an interesting area control game going on the planet where you are laying down tiles to represent seas, forests, cities, and special sites.  You can accumulate a lot of points with well-placed cities and forests so you need to keep an eye on the board and to leap on opportunities when they present themselves.  There are also milestones and awards that your compete for that also keep the tension high.  Even when it's not your turn, it keeps you engaged as you monitor what your competition is doing.  Overall the game length and complexity feel just about right and I always end with a feeling of satisfaction.

RATING: 7
Terraforming Mars hits many of the right notes for fans of engine-building games. It is a straightforward game to teach, leaving the players to discover the complexity and depth of options through the encounters with the cards. Through many rule variations and paths to victory, it provides a great bit of variety in the box. While the presentation is functional but forgettable and sometimes the randomness of the card draw or event cards can be frustrating, there are enough interesting decisions and interactions to make it worthy of the praise it has received.

This game has accurate science, great art work, re-playability, wonderful mechanisms but rather flimsy components.

My wife, who has not played a game since our adult children were kids, cannot stop playing this game. She is a retired microbiologist and says the science is accurate.

I bought the game, but can't help feel that it is over-rated.  It just is not as tight as though the ages - a new story of civilization which I play a lot and draw some similar comparisons to.  Yes the "hard" science theme is refreshing and it is so great to get questions from my nine year old about the science behind the cards, but should that cloud the other issues with the game?   This game feels a bit sloppy at times.  It is a bit long and some components are suspect.  We don't find the "take that" to be too big of a deal.  It keeps you from hoarding plant resources in a more forgiving way than the corruption mechanic in through the ages.

Basically a card game at heart.  I won (5p game) mostly by heating up the temperature.  Does suffer from the randomness of the card draws... I had the role/special feature that steel (?) was worth an extra euro when used to play cards that you could use that resource to buy with.. but I never got a card to increase my production of that resource...

2nd play, this time only 3p, and with the extra cards... I basically came in 2nd 1 point behind winner... which could have been easily been reversed if different cards came up (I had the plant role costing only 7 to plant trees... but another player got the cards to get even more plant production than I did... also came across very few cards to place cities... which I could have used with my tree planing, to have got lots more points for being surrounded by my trees.

still a fun a game to play but the random cards you get makes it a much lighter game than I prefer

Boring to me and doesn't feel like I am really terraforming Mars. Maybe in an abstract sense, or maybe I am being too hard on it. It feels like Race for the Galaxy a bit in the card buildup but goes on for hours instead of closer to a filler. I get that it makes it more of an epic feel but it also just gets draggy.

Options rapidly dwindle as the game goes on and you are fishing for point cards and playable spaces on Mars grind down to a halt between illegal plays or helping others. If the temp/oxygen tracks are max'd, you don't get credit for advancing them, thus limiting your options even further.  In the late game, did you happen to draw/draft scoring cards? Hooray! You didn't? Don't expect to win, because many of the cards are mostly useless at that point and whoever did draw scoring cards will get a nice point swing on you. Maybe keep a couple of big cards early for the late game, even though it costs you money up front.

Thematically, I never felt like I was terraforming Mars. It's mostly a card game, ala RftG, Why reinvent the wheel?

Really liking my early plays so far...  very satisfying feeling when I get my engine going.

The project card art is inconsistent and jarring. 
The rulebook has a few issues.  Flimsy player mats.

Great game though!

Lots of variabilities given 208 project cards and every card is unique.  12 corporations that you can play.

Plays very smooth.  Lots of engine building goodness.

The Solitaire variant is great.

Love the card combos with the playing of tiles on the board late game.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (October 2016)

I was very keen to play Terraforming Mars. It was the best game at Essen 2016 , so I had a healthy skepticism due to hype and I was right. The game is good but nothing earth shattering. In general, hype have killed many games for me, it is much better to have a neutral expectation so I can better gauge the game, sadly, many times that is not possible.

The game components are ok. Every copy I have seen (over 6) had the flimsy insert broken. The resource cubes look amazing, but they peel off rather easily. In my copy, the cards came warped. The player´s boards are very flimsy. In general, as is usual from Stronghold Games, the production values aren’t great, but they are good enough.

The theme is fascinating, one of my favorites and the cards and flavor text convey it very well.

Terraforming Mars can accommodate up to 5 players, but in that case the downtime is way too much for me. I won’t ever again play it with 5, I feel it is much better as a 3 player game. It also has a solo mode which is great for people who like to play alone (I don’t ever).

Terraforming Mars has meaty decisions (a huge plus for me). You can buy project cards, play project cards, fund an award, claim a milestone, create a greenery, raise the temperature. The game comes with many project cards and you have to purchase them before you can use them so you have to plan carefully, the idea is to get cards that have a lot of synergy between them. There is some luck of the draw with the cards but I feel it is totally controllable, you can still do a lot without projects but that cost a lot of money. In general, you have to carefully manage the 6 resources to get the better outcome, it is a lot of fun. 

I particularly like the award mechanism. To activate it, you have to spend money and it will give VPs to the player who most have the condition, the catch is that you have to activate when playing the game and the VPs are awarded at the end of the game, so when an award is active players begin to compete fiercely to be first. In our game, all the players who funded the awards lost their first position in the relevant award, thus, expending a lot of money for the benefit of their opponents :devil:. 

Terraforming Mars is an Euro game with a mean streak (a minor dislike for me), there are some attack cards that can really set you back, fortunately, I feel the game is balanced because playing them is usually expensive. I LOVE (thematically) that you can plunge a whole moon into Mars :D.

I have only played with basic corporations, I’m very keen on trying the advanced cards! 

Bottom line, Terraforming Mars is a good engine building game with plenty of non-obvious decisions. My desire to play it again is very high and it is a keeper in my game collection. 

Current Rating: 7.5

I finally played with the corporations and I liked them a lot :D. I really like the idea of having some unique advantages and using the corporations adds to the replayability. I hope and expect they are balanced, but I have played too few times to really know.

The card quality is very bad, the cards themselves get mark very easily. You need to sleeve them ASAP.

Lately, my desire to play terraforming Mars has increased a lot. I find the game very compelling and fascinating. I always want to play it.

I already bought all the expansions and promos for the game and a friend made me a special wood board for the players. If Im going to play the game, I vastly prefer the draft variant.

Terraforming Mars is a very good game and I expect to play it soon again.

My desire to play Terraforming Mars is very high, so I’m upgrading its rating. It´s a great game and I always want to play it. The barrier is that I don’t really want to play it with more than 3 players (and I always have more than 3 players at hand). With 4-5 players, I find the game has an excessive downtime.

RATING: 9
Mostly played it solo so far, but that's a real blast!
I'm not even sure why I enjoy it so much, except for very suspenseful build-up: Usually, it's a very close call to successfully terraform, with most of the 'real work' getting done in the last two turns.

It's been a while since I played a game that I immediately wanted to play again after finishing a game. And I find myself thinking about the game long after it's finished, too, wondering how I might have played better.

The only thing that slightly mars the experience are several cards that are useless for the solo game. So, it's possible to be unlucky and have a really bad start.
But if it wasn't for that, it would likely be too easy to win.

Multiplayer is a different experience, but easily as enjoyable. Timing your actions now becomes a lot more important, and since you don't know exactly when the game will end, it gets a lot harder to calculate if playing a particular card will be worth it or not.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A tableau-building game with interactivity driven by board positioning and the acquisition of resources from the terraforming tracks.  Despite the exceptionally attractive (to me) theme, the game would not shine without the variability provided by the over 200 cards representing upgrades and events that can occur to the player's corporation.

While the game is certainly not "streamlined" like Race for the Galaxy, it provides a similar feel with interlocking and sometimes synergistic card powers providing dynamism to what would otherwise be a stodgy eurogame base.

This game will not reach the heights for me that more complex eurogames might, but it is more broadly approachable and still provides me a very good gaming experience, so I am likely to end up playing it more than other 2016 releases.

Recommended with drafting variant.

Space theme is not my cup of tea.  Since the cards are not divided into different phase, player may draw some powerful card which is not applicable at early stage, and will waste the chance/turn.
However, if someone like the theme, the different starting condition for each player, with lots of cards, will increase its replayability.

RATING: 9
Where to begin?
- This game is all about the cards... Building an engine... to build a bigger engine... oh and doing stuff on the board to Terraform Mars. Can't forget that part.
- My engineer friends and I really enjoy this. There's not too much player interaction but you have to keep an eye on each other for the scoring bonuses.
- Speaking of scoring bonuses, the player-funded achievements are a great idea. Do you pay for one early game (at a lower price), potentially slowing your engine but ensuring it gets scored, or do you wait until you've got bulk cash and you know you'll win it? But then blimey it's expensive, if at all available! Great mechanism.
- Artwork is pretty dreadful. Box insert is garbage. Component quality is purely okay. Really wish they'd have done a better job on the art, components and graphic design.
- Plays 2-4 well. Teaching isn't too hard.
- Looking forward to expansions.

First off I need to preface this with the fact that we thoroughly enjoy playing this game and will continue to play it - with our own rule set.  Update:  Drafting rules solved many of the problems described below for 2 player games

For one of the top rated games (6th overall at the time of writing), I was unpleasantly surprised at how imbalanced the gameplay is.  After spending  7-8 hours with the game we began to realize, at least with 2 players, that one player would end up running away with the game. By hour 12 we could pick out by generation 4 who was going to win.  

It's a great game at it's core and has a lot of possibility but there are a few fatal flaws.  Lack of and expense of negative effects to other players, over powered cards like 'pay 1 energy to draw a card', and ease/lack of reason to terraform are just some of the glaring issues with the game.  Terraforming felt almost incidental - a side effect of resource management rather than something to strive for.  

In addition, many of the mechanics are underdeveloped/underused, animals/microbes & restrictions based on terraforming levels in particular, and even with the Corporate Era cards the game is often over too soon.  

A final, minor, quibble is that with 2 player games there is a lack of player markers.  We'd frequently run out of player markers of a given colour and the copper/silver/gold markers come chipped out of the box. 

Overall, I would still play it and recommend it, despite the problems.

RATING: 8
Fun, an engine builder card/board game hybrid.  We've enjoyed it, though as veteran drafters we felt compelled to use the drafting variant.  I don't know that drafting is worth the extra play time it adds.  I think there's a danger that Terraforming Mars might be a little bit too long for what it is, and drafting definitely exacerbates that.  I'll settle on a final rating after we get some more experience playing without the draft.  The components are pretty sub-par, btw...a decent tray to keep the cubes from sliding around is a must.

UPDATE:  We tried playing without the drafting variant last night, a huge success.  It cut down our play time from around five hours to just under three, and that included teaching a new player.  To be fair we didn't have to stop to eat or walk the dog, but still, the game was way, way shorter, and none of us really missed the draft.  We won't be drafting again.

Terraforming Mars is a well-designed game with lots going for it. The theme is sure to draw sci-fi geeks, and the box artwork lured me with its siren's song.

While I enjoyed my first play, I found that the itch was scratched and I haven't felt the need to play again since.

RATING: 8
It's a simple game with a complex web of levers and point sources manipulated through card play. The cards are used to generate or modify 6 resource types, which are used to create greenery and oxygen and to pay for more cards. Cards are either one-time powerful events, business endeavors which provide additional actions or modifiers, or terraforming achievements which provide a single benefit, but continue to affect later cards according to the matching icons. When Mars has enough heat, oxygen and water to sustain life, the game ends.

I like this more than Race for the Galaxy, the gold standard in icon-driven tableau-building. I feel like Race ends just when it's getting going, while in Terraforming Mars strategies and changes in strategy have enough time to mature and evolve. The board play and resource management all give this one a lot more meat to the bones. I passed on Race a long time ago, but I think I'll keep this one around for a while.

Largely indirect, engine-building, card combo game. Felt very MPS to me. Surprisingly random for such a highly touted game. Luck of the draw is very significant to the point that the most important decisions are which cards to keep/toss. The rest of the game is when to play them which is largely determined by how much money you have at the time.

The game actually reminded me a lot of Dominion. The whole game is in how you react to the cards you currently have. And aside from a few take-that cards, the game is very solitaire. Not really my thing.

RATING: 6
The new hotness, rapidly rising up the BGG list just three weeks after its initial US release in late September.  Have played 8 times already, and predict that the newness will probably wear off after 6-9 months or so.  Positives:  interesting, unique theme, card-driven with a couple of unique elements but nothing you haven't seen before.  On the negative side, the outcome seems highly luck dependent unless you use a drafting variant which will certainly add to playing time.  To date, I have mostly avoided the longer Corporate game also due to concerns about playing time, as 1 1/2 to 2 hours for the base game seems about right, length in terms of number of rounds depends on the # of players, fewer players means more rounds to hit the three endgame criteria.  Most games have lasted 12-N or 11-N rounds, N being the number of players.  (I.e., a five-player game will generally take 6 or 7 rounds), so this makes planning for the endgame a bit easier.

Overall, this is a solid game that will remain popular until the next new hotness comes along, probably in a month or two when the Essen titles hit the States.  So, right now a solid 7 but frankly don't see it getting much higher.

EDIT:  My prediction, at least for me, has come true.  I haven't played the game for over a month now and don't see any urge to rush to play it again.  I think other new releases, in particular Great Western Trail, the new Tesla vs Edision and Manhattan Project:  Energy Empire are much more interesting.

Once you get past the rule book, the iconography and the multitude of cards there’s a really great game. I had a lot of fun. Mind you, there is also a great deal of luck of the draw in this one. Yes, you can draft, but that only serves to potentially block an opponent.  I think a table of 8-12 face up cards per generation where players can purchase a card for 3 credits as their first action and 6 credits for a second would be an improvement.

Green and Blue Player Cubes are sooo hard to read on the board when set against the greenery tiles. Some of the card powers are very powerful and we will need to be on the lookout for them. If they are in play, shortening the game is the best bet, to prevent cumulative scoring opportunities.

I like it but it is not without its flaws.  Card draw is a bit random so I like drafting.  I wish there were other ways to draw cards.  There probably needs to be a 2 player variant that gets more cards out because in a five player game I can imagine more chains happening that are reliant on cities being out on the board or other players doing more things.  I also wish they had a deck 1, 2, and 3 with low cost, middle cost, and high cost cards so you could pick which ones you want.  It would make it easier in the beginning, and better towards end game to get bigger vp cards.

Most of it is like patience in slow motion. Too much down-time. Not enough interaction. What little interaction there is, is often to take something away from someone else, but it is not easy to see who is winning, so you don't know who to penalise.  Not sure how you can achieve it in the stated 90-120 minutes.

I honestly don't get what the fuzz is all about - especially among many hard core players. Yes the combos are nice, but as a Magic TG player I can say: "That don't impress me much." It is definitely lacking new or special mechanisms. Drafting and card combos? I expect more of a game that won several gaming prices. 
It's not like it has innovative and complex, but also interconnected mechanisms like Great Western Trail that offer a great variety of strategic options! 

Just to be clear: It's not a bad game. It's pretty decent - but nothing special. But I was so much looking forward to it and (because I am a big fan of this theme) such I had so high expectations that the downfall was great - that's why I kind of dislike it now. But (on contrary to most critics) I do like the artwork. That's a plus. 

Also, it gets too random and disbalanced with the card / combos. With drafting it takes too long. Best choices are obvious. For what TM is and what it wants to be there a definitely better options on the market. 

To sum up I like to quote the user "adrim" whose comment gives you a pretty good overview. 

The good:
+ the theme
+ card combos (if you are lucky to get the right cards at the right time)

The bad:
- there is no way to search the deck, so you have to play whatever you happen to get
- luck factor is very high
- choices are obvious
- the game plays it self
- to long for what it is
- low replay value
- low quality components

Terraforming Mars isn't my usual kind of game, but I thought it delivered a strong narrative (unusual for the genre) and provided plenty of interaction among the players.  A very well done design.

RATING: 9
Terraforming Mars will be one of the hits of Spiel 2016, if not the hit game itself. And justifiably so. Given the record of FryxGames so far and first reports of cards with take-that elements, I wasn't expecting too much. But the ongoing discussion and many positive comments got me interested. After playing it, I regret it a bit that I didn't preorder.

Players try to build up an engine granting them some benefit to help in transforming Mars. Three elements are needed to achieve this: oxygen, increasing temperature and water. The variable game end sets in when all three tracks are maxed out. The game is in the cards. Players have to process a lot of information each turn, resulting in plenty of different possibilities  to gain victory points. Focus on some kind of resource, raise animals, build on the board. Not everything can be done but something should be done well. Achievements and milestones can tip the scales. Unless screwage is focused on a single player, it doesn't hurt too much.

An original game with a unique feel. Making the best out of what you're dealt is a satisfying puzzle. Replayability is guaranteed due to the mass of cards and individualized starting positions when all game elements are used. Building up the engine is multiplayer solitaire with some potential for doing mistakes or clumsily deranging the player board. Activities on the board and the joint progress on the three tracks bring the players together again in competition.

Pretty much Jenn's and my favorite game for maybe six months now. Eight plays in six months of a game of this length is a lot for us. It's not particularly innovative, but it just "works," and we both like it about equally well and do about equally well playing it, hence the relatively high number of plays. Have H&E and Venus Next.

Great engine building game. The best strategic way to play (drafting) also drags the game down a tremendous amount. My rating is for the standard game, without the drafting.

Drafting is a much more fair and strategic way to play, but it does at a cost of AP/downtime.

I'm conflicted about Terraforming Mars. On one hand it's clearly deeply flawed mechanically, particularly due to a combination of a) a very thick deck, b) card design that depends on building up synergies between potentially very rare card types, c) no way of actually mitigating the randomness. The negative interaction card effects also seem very lazy and were very frustrating.

On the other hand the both the theme and the integration of theme/mechanics were great. I really enjoyed my one play of this just on the basis of that. I just don't see that being enough in the long run.

Thematically intriguing and theme has been well implemented with proper components and very clear iconography. This is actually a card game with a lot of added elements and I rather like the macro level randomness created by a large deck of cards. Research phase should definitely be done by drafting. There is some take that which is mostly lightweight and subtle, but if it starts piling on you it gets very annoying. Beginner corporation concept is useless in my opinion and both steel and titanium feel a bit redundant as they are really only second and third form of currency. The endgame can be a pain with AP heavy players.

Pretty much everything about this game is wrong. I love tableau builders but not this one. It has unbalanced cards that are situational. The actual task you are doing is incredibly boring.

On the other hand. The theme is cool. So there is that.

Terraforming Mars is a nice Euro with a couple of twists but nothing mechanically groundbreaking and a theme which didn't really grab me that much.

What makes the game shine is how it implements its theme. Everything makes thematic sense is nicely embedded into the overall objectiv to terraform Mars.

I was surprised how much I really liked the game.

RATING: 7
Fun to play, especially in later generations when you've got more cards in play.  Towards the end of the game there's so much stuff going on with everyone's tableau that it's easy to overlook special benefits.  Ultimately, the game necessitates a lot of careful accounting attention that distracts from enjoying the game.  But if you want to win, pay ruthless attention to  all that minutiae .  Abundance of game cards and corporations makes every play of the game unique.  It's a nerdy-science good time.

As has been widely commented, a legit down side is that the player mats are essentially un-playable out of the box.  Get yourself a third-party cover or alternate tray to manage the game pieces.

Unexpectedly fun game, I went in with minimal expectations because I thought it was over-hyped, however I was pleasantly surprised by the variety of options and amount of tactics involved, though the extreme randomness of the cards prevents a real strategy. This is rapidly becoming one of my favorite games of all time, the lack of being able to create a long term strategy is offset by the spontaneity and having to adapt to the cards and changing map.

Played this at Geekway 2017 and LOVED IT! Now own it, but need to find time to play. Worth the hype.

Second play: I liked it the second go 'round even more. The people who explained the rules to us at Geekway left a good chunk out and included the Corporate Era cards in when they weren't supposed to be there.

To refresh myself on it, I talked with some friends and watched a really good video on the tube of you which gave very good explanations. When we played it, I pretty much followed the same pattern as the video. Everyone got it and all but one liked the game. One person said it was "too complicated." To each their own. 

Now that we are more comfortable with it, we started using the non-beginner corporations and employ those more often.

Still a great game and will try adding Hellas and Elysium when possible.

Oct 15/16. Not a bad game. It has a strong feel of Race for the Galaxy or Core Worlds - buying and building up your card empire - but with a board in the center so it gives a stronger connection to building something. Art/design could use some work as well (looks like someone with not a lot of experience did this). The kicker for me though was the strong multiplayer solitaire vibe (which I make an active effort to avoid). 

Would I play it again? Sure. It's just doesn't stand out as an individual. Nothing is really new here. Rated a 6.

One of the best games in recent years. The theme and mechanics are great and only thing missing really, is the pvp action. But if you like optimization games, like Race for the Galaxy etc, then this is a game for you. There is some player interaction during the game, but if you're looking for heavy conflict, avoid this... Takes optimisation games to a next level, for me at least.

The design of the game mechanics and the replayability of this game are incredible, and would get a 9 from me, but the component quality, particularly the player boards are of such cheap design and material that it's disgusting for the price of this game. The player boards that come in the boxes actually take away from the quality of playing the game as any bump of the table or a stray shirt sleeve, and your resources are sliding all over. 

Highly recommend getting a storage solution such as the one from Broken Token, as the storage trays double as replacement player boards and making keeping track of all of your various resources much easier and prevent pieces from scattering. 

All that said, it is an extremely fun and well designed game.

2017-08-15 - 6 - It's an OK game, but nothing spectacular. Multiplayer solitare engine building game, where at the end of the game you try to throw on the table every card you happen to have in hand (what leads to lack of interesting decisions because you can afford everything). I prefer GWT or Ora et Labora if I need to play a little heavier rather non-interactive eurogame.
This one misses some spark, although it's fine and I can play it from time to time. The theme is pretty strong through most of the game, what is always a plus for me. 
It could last a little shorter.
Awards mechanism is pretty cool.

2017-11-28 - 6->5 - It's way too long! I played without corporation cards and special corporation powers and it still was very long multiplayer solitare, where everyone was focused only on their cards or their playerboard. Interaction is realy weak part in this game, because you really don't care what others do for 90% of time or - haha, you just lost your resources, because of someone else's card.
I don't get the hype. I got it that it's a proper working game, which many maight enjoy, but number 6 on BGG? No way. There is nothing original or unique here.

Play Race for the Galaxy instead. Quicker, more fun, more interesting interaction, still tableau building game in space. Not to mention better artwork.

RATING: 7
Terraforming Mars is a sandbox with a straightjacket, because you have a lot to do but restrained by your resources and cards. This game is all about variety and it is a good game, but not for my taste. Some thoughs: the game is long, 3 hours with 3 players (only one noob, myself); the game feels repetitive, because you perform the same things turn to turn and it is possible to run your engine several times that you get tired of it; randomness is kind of high, because all  the cards are different you can or can't make a combo based purely on luck; misplaced Take That, a game with such amount of strategy and duration has cards that allows the player to destroy/steal resources from other players, makes no sense to me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
My first play of this was good, I enjoyed it but wasn't super impressed, but after my second game where we played with the drafting variant I knew I have to get a copy of this game. The drafting of cards is probably the *only* way I'll play this game now, even with new players. It's an engine/tableau builder so getting cards that synergize with your engine is paramount and seeing your actions combo is what makes this game so satisfying. I'm surprised that it seems to have been such a universal hit, I was definitely underwhelmed on my first play but still found it enjoyable, glad it got so much better with the drafting of the cards.

I do wish there was a more interaction than where to place things on the board and the "take that" actions to take away plants from people really feel a but tacked on. The drafting adds a bit of interaction where you can deny cards to opponents, but I hope the planned expansions add more interactive elements to the game. I would also echo the sentiments about the art in the game, the card art switching styles is very amateurish.

Overall, the gameplay is very smooth and really enjoy the thematic purpose of all the cards and actions in the game. It's pretty easy for new players to grasp and players are often executing good card power combinations in their first game.

I have really enjoyed this game in solo mode.  As a group game, it is not very interactive.  You basically are trying to build your own company and other players are trying to build their own company.  There is not a lot of player interaction.  Once the game is over, you simply add up points to see who won.  You never really know who won until it is over.  I think the fun is playing the game and not winning the game.  I like games that I have to think and come up with a strategy and then try to manipulate the game to work for me.  This game is exactly that concept.   It is also very well balanced.

Played 3+ player games twice, played solitaire game five times.

Great engine builder.  Because of how much money you are getting in the end game, you don't have that "ends too soon" feeling like you get with other games.
You'll get that giddy delight seeing your engine or combo start taking off and reaping its rewards.

Solitaire is fun, but not worth the price of admission alone.

Rulebook is.... ugh.  Check for better fan-made rulebooks and resource materials.  Once the game gets going though, it flows nicely, with the only thing you will probably forget are increasing your TF rating when you increase oxygen/water/temp.

The game may feel like a luck of the draw however, so fans may implement a variant to increase the odds of getting what you want.

A Terraforming Mars egy nagyon korrekt kártyás, térképes társas, amiben fontos ezt a két elemet jól összehangolni, megfelelően kell helyezkedni a Marson, és lehetőleg egymással (és a saját táblánkkal) jól kooperáló lapokat próbálunk kijátszani. Inkább hevi kategória, de csak olyan közepesen, viszonylag gyorsan rá lehet érezni a játékmenetre. Alapvetően eléggé pasziánsz jellegű, a térképen kicsit figyelgetjük egymást, de nagy interakcióra nem szabad számítani.
A játszma maga jó élmény volt, de nem szerettem bele a játékba, számomra nem különösebben vonzó sem a téma, sem pedig a szabályrendszer. Ettől függetlenül egy nagyon korrekt játéknak tartom, de nem többnek.

I enjoyed the first half of my initial game a great deal.  I thought the game should have wrapped up sooner than it did.  But, it was a learning game, so I recognize my play could become faster as I get more facile with the game.

However, 2 different local friends own it, and it is not an easy game.  So I do not need to own it.  I will be content to play on my friends copies now and then.  Another concern is that I suspect the game will be longer with more players.  I thought the 3p game ran long.  Not so sure I want to experience a 5p game.

Update:  just finished a 5p game.  Much too much waiting for my turn.  Game was much longer than the prior 4p game I played.  I will hithertoo demur from playing it with 5p.

Lots of cool stuff happening at the same time: card play, hand management, tile placement, light area control, resource management. Comes together nicely in a flexible, smooth-playing game that allows you to play how you like. Well-researched tech cards appeal to the casual science nerd in me. Not too long of a game, flew by even with 3 people just learning it.

This is one of the best 3 or 5 games from 2016.  Period.  I love this game.  So much to explore.  It takes the tableau building aspects that I love of RFTG and others, and adds a great board mechanism and cool end game triggers.

Terraforming Mars: Wow! -- How did this fly under my radar for so long. I guess that the look-and-feel of Wilderness put me off, but this is golden stuff. Buy it, play it. It is fun solo as well. 

Addendum -- corporate era cards seems to bog down the game, so will probably only add a subset of those to the game for future game sessions.

Holy moly, this is the first game I've owned that I've sat down with someone to play every night for about a week straight. Also my first game to sit down play a game, and immediately play another one.  And after 21 plays I'm still excited to play another one.  This game has you trying to perfect your economy of 6 different resources while also doing a bit of area control on the planet of mars. Ultimately the goal is to have most TR(VP) but there seems to be quite a few different ways to achieve it. I feel as someone very comfortable with the game I could teach it in 20 min or so. The game "clicks" within first 4 turns.  Stronghold has said they intend to release 2-3 expansions in 2017 and I am dying for them so I get even more reason to play this game.  Medium game, takes a little longer than an hour if you have 2 players who really know the game, else it's normally hour and a half to two hours. Worth your time and money to get this game!

My first eurogame in collection. Nice to play. Very interesting decisions, and pleasant play.

Terraformacja Marsa, chyba nie ma planszówkowicza, który nie słyszałby o tej grze. Gra ma swoje ewidentne zalety: Jak na eurosuchara ma całkiem niezły klimat, który objawia się tym, że wszystkie akcje mają naukowy sens. Jest bardzo prosta do wytłumaczenia i całkiem przyjemna do zagrania. Z minusów, trzeba napisać o jakości planszetek i nierównej jakości grafik, choć szczerze mówiąc mi gra podoba się bardzo. Nie jest to poziom hitów od FFG, jednak rozłożona na stole nie przestraszy jak niektóre inne gry euro. Z czystym sercem polecam, chyba, że jesteś zdeklarowanym ameritrashowcem z alergią na euro, wtedy najprawdopodobniej nawet tego nie przeczytasz :)

Excellent game! My favorite engine builder by far. Have yet to teach this to anyone who doesn’t like it. Plenty of variety in the cards for replays. Still have yet to try the drafting option but I think it will make it even better. 
The downsides are the player mat. I feel that if I even look at it wrong I will scatter all my cubes. While the corporate variant is the best version it does drag the game out some. Also shuffling 208 cards for setup seems to take forever. 
All that being said, highly recommend this game. Love bringing it out to the table

Game is 1 hour too long. Draft is interesting but can also screw you over -> too luck depended. "Art" is horrible, so is production Quality, why does this game cost 60$? There are no "tiers" of cards or some kind of ages, all cards are in the game from draft 1. 

It was fun building an engine thats why I "could play again" but I would never buy it nor would I prefer it.

I wasn't sure if I would like TM as I don't really care for the theme too much, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Unlike other Euros there is some luck involved and a little bit of bash the perceived leader. Timing is also a key element as you try to race and get things done before your opponents. Overall, a solid game that plays relatively fast.

Terraformacja na planszy i przy pomocy kart (masy kart). Ciekawa, dobrze przemyślana i przetestowana gra ekonomiczna (euro) w której czuć klimat prawdziwej terraformacji planety. Mimo wielu zachwytów i bardzo wysokiego miejsca na BGG, mi osobiście nic nie urywa. Rozumiem czemu się podoba i faktycznie jest to bardzo dobra gra, a jednak jakaś taka.. nie wiem. Chyba efekt psują słabe (bo tanie) grafiki przygotowane przez samych twórców i sam dizajn kart. Jeśli będzie wydana w jakieś nowej, bardziej przyjemnej szacie graficznej to kto wie? Co ciekawe mimo masy komponentów cena jest bardzo przyzwoita.

RATING: 8
I didn’t think I’d like this game much. I was dead wrong. According to its most ferocious critics, TM is defined as a low interaction, under produced, overly expensive cube-pusher-euro that’s also full of randomness. And while not entirely accurate, there’s some truth to this statement. Yet, in spite its flaws, I’m obsessed with it. It quickly became one of my favorite games ever. My affection for TM is comes from many places: its butter smooth gameplay feels exciting and tense every step of the way, kinda like a race, where you get to build your own ship and watch it fly (or stumble) across the galaxy as you wave your enemies goodbye. This process has a very tangible sense of buildup and progression, that translates visually onto the board and your player mat; and while your choices are plenty, you never feel overwhelmed. The amazing card system provides emergent depth, so learning is a breeze, but it will take some plays until some of its most refined subtleties unveil themselves. I don’t consider this game to be too long, because I barely notice time passing. 

In a world full of trading in the Mediterranean, the Terraforming Mars has one of the most refreshing and enticing themes to date. When I introduced my friends to Agricola they said “Who wants to be a farmer anyway?” which is valid criticism. And even if what your doing here is basically being a farmer on Mars, the game makes you feel like your doing grand  things. 

Based on its design, I rate TM a 9. But the game has two critical flaws: the player mats and the art on the cards. The player mats are so bad it’s hard to believe they went with it. I had to buy those acrylic overlays, which pushed the game cost > 100€. And this is **not** a 100€ game. This feels almost revolting, especially since there are games out there with AMAZING quality of components and overall care in production such as Scythe and even Inis. The single most used component in the game is the player mat. And in this game this is a thin sheet of paper, that requires you to have the skill of a surgeon in order to maneuver properly. This single aspect could detract potential buyers from getting the game.

The art on the cards is barely serviceable. You get a mix of pictures and paintings that make no sense together. Some images just feel like you googled “Team building exercice 99”, or “Sweet white dog”. Quite honestly some of it is laughable. However, I was able to ignore this part of the game that annoyed me. Which is a different case regarding the player mats, which made the game unplayable for me.

The art on the tiles is serviceable, the board is fine but sub-par, the resource cubes are amazing but chip easily. I do like the box art, although the box itself is very flimsy. 

This feels like the world’s most precious flower in a 1 dollar vase. But it’s a truly amazing experience, and I’m so so happy to have this on my shelf. 

Will make a video review soon.

Friends love this game, but I'm on the fence. In one playthrough, we got to a point where no one was placing the last water tile to trigger the end game because the players scores seemed too close. Players just kept playing cards to keep getting more victory points for the sake of victory points. At one point, I exclaimed, "What are we even doing anymore?"

I bought Terraforming Mars only 3 weeks ago and it’s already one of the best economic games I’ve ever played. The rules are easy to learn so it’s perfect for beginners. I also love the theme – making Mars livable gives me a lot of fun. Even though the mechanic of the game is really good, the quality of the components is terrible - cards are too thin, the board is tiny and crowded and all the cubes have one corner that is chipped. But the worst of all is game design – pictures on cards look like random free stock pictures. It’s a great game left in prototype form.

First impression is a mostly multi-player solitaire. Longer than expected play time for this sort of game. I can see that it would take multiple plays or card studying to know what cards to keep. Even then you will need to draw the right ones as card luck is heavy. Point salad scoring takes awhile to tally at the end.

Realy enjoyable game in playing.
+ Smooth gameplay, due to clear icons and text!!! An example of how it should be!
+ I like the mechanisms.
+ Tension between players is real.
+ Lots of possible strategies.

= Theme, I never feel like a corp terrafoming mars. 
= I can see 236 expansions coming, not sure if it needs those (besides randomizable milestones/awards)

- Luck of the draw.
- Component quality. 
- Last round can drag. 


I love doing what it takes to terraform mars but I'm not sure how I feel about the luck of the draw. A mismatch between corporation and the cards you draw is possible. It is also possible a player can put down a nice point generating engine on the first hand while another has nothing but scattered bits and pieces. So early on it "can" be obvious who will do well and who won't not saying it is clear who will win but the game can be "easy" on you or harsh.

[size=12][b]Why I like Terraforming Mars:[/b][/size]
+ The game has a good theme
+ The game has decent replayability
+ The game requires meaningful decisions to win the game. 
+ I am not a fan of pure card drafting games so the other mechanics and the game board kept me engaged for a large number of plays. I definitely prefer this game over games like 7 Wonders. 

[size=12][b]Fixable dislikes in regards to Terraforming Mars:[/b][/size]
/ The player boards are awful if you do not upgrade them.
/ My main criticism of the game is that the game is not balanced for a game about optimization. Some of the corporations are significantly better than others and this is made worse by the blind card draws. The Hellas & Elysium expansion just makes this game worse. After all, changing the awards / map and nothing else is obviously detrimental to the balance of the game. I refuse to play this game unless I get to pick the corporation that I want to play with. I cannot tolerate the randomness of getting bad corporation cards. 
+ The duration of the game is fine with 3 players.

[size=12][b]Why I dislike Terraforming Mars:[/b][/size]
- The game is hard to teach
- The art for the game is awful. 
- Most people do not like letting me choose my corporation because of the balance issues.

RATING: 2
Takes forever, but some folks really like it. Not me, I find it too chaotic. The effects are usually spectacular, like crashing a second moon or nuking some part of Mars.
But it takes up a lot of space when playing, you really need the plexiglass overlays for managing your chits - that are NOT present in the game itself. Even for the $80 the makers didn't care for them. 
Gameplay wise: 
The card drafting is very weird especially if you have no idea what is in the deck. So you're just blindly flaying around in the dark on the odd chance you hit some combo. 
I like that you get points for reaching some temperature/oxygen threshold, but everyone is competing with that; I like the bonuses to go for. 
In the end it's just hard to make the cards work for you and for that it takes too long.
It's like Race for the Galaxy the board game plus untold expansions in Race.
I don't hate to play it, but will only choose to play it if there is nothing else. But it certainly does not deserve an 8+. 
If your group likes Innovation, TM is just like that. But far longer.

Based on only one play, but it wasn't my kind of thing. Maybe because it was 5 players, but there was too much down time: think about your turn for 30 seconds, then you've got 10 minutes doing nothing other than occasionally fiddling cubes on autopilot until the next generation. Only a couple times did other players' actions change what I was doing that generation; mostly I was bored. Would not play again.

Update: after playing again, this time with 4, my rating stands.  It was the same deal as the first time: think about your turn for 30 seconds, then sit there for 5 minutes until you have something to think about again.  I think in the entire game there were only three points where I had to pay attention to what the other players were doing.

Everyone in our 5 player group really enjoyed this game. It was excellent in both mechanics and theme. The rules are relatively simple to grasp (not so many detailed nuances like in Scythe for example) and there is plenty of variety and interesting choices to be made. 
The player should be double layered because even in our first play there were two accidents with these even though we tried to be careful. Need to buy some accessories to help prevent these mishaps.

Really interesting newer game. The race for terraforming in three different areas definitely helps the game refrain from becoming one-sided. Excellent solo play, but solo play becomes very luck based with the drawing of cards and more one-dimensional as city building becomes practically non-existant. Wouldn't recommend multiplayer without card drafting before each generation.

In the 2400s, mankind begins to terraform the planet Mars. Giant corporations, sponsored by the World Government on Earth, initiate huge projects to raise the temperature, the oxygen level, and the ocean coverage until the environment is habitable. In Terraforming Mars, you play one of those corporations and work together in the terraforming process, but compete for getting victory points that are awarded not only for your contribution to the terraforming, but also for advancing human infrastructure throughout the solar system, and doing other commendable things.

Good combination of several mechanics. Nothing groundbreaking but a solid game. Need to play with the advanced deck and mechanics.

[update] the "full game" is essential. The drafting mechanic ensures that RNG is mitigated and that your strategy is more deliberate, and the asymmetric corporation powers adds even more fun and replay to the game.

RATING: 5
Terrible artwork and overly-long, it's a playable engine builder with some small spatial elements.

For me the issues are the game is too disconnected mechanically from theme, and the mechanics that are connected are too weak and insignificant compared to the randomness of card draw.

I like the board play and the idea of the three tracks to the endgame, but I would prefer if much less work was done by the cards themselves. Also it takes far too long.

One play, 2p. Didn't like it that much. There is some easy Race for the galaxy feel in some of the card play, but in many ways it feels linear. I like euros and integration between elements. Here the elements are too isolated. The toughest decision is to evaluate the price of the card and if it is worth it. So, not for me.

Really sub-par production value (board fonts & art, player boards knocking, etc.)  Beyond that the game is alright but nothing special.  It's essentially a card game with a board thrown in that really doesn't do much.  The card play itself is ok but a bit fiddly and too long for what it is.  Once you pick a strategy, it's mostly about executing with the cards you get.  Low real player interaction.  Some cards are annoying or seem unbalanced.  Overall not a bad game, but savagely over-hyped.

Only negative aspect of this game is the duration. A 2-player game can easily take 2 or 3 hours to finish, which is way too much. Nevertheless, it is a fantastic game. Love it.

I'm enjoying this one quite a bit and have bumped it from 8 -> 9. I really enjoy card games with unique cards and tableau building with a bit of an engine development process. Prefer to play with the draft and the corporations. Have yet to try the advanced deck - perhaps next time. 

I also broke down and picked up the Broken Token insert which is beautiful and works very well. However, expansion boards won't fit so well with the BT insert if that is a concern. Games still take 2-3 hours but I don't think about how long the game is going on as I'm engaged in the process most of the time. I probably will seek to avoid 5 player games if possible. I'm intrigued how different Mars looks after each game. I wish I had taken a photo after each game! I've played a game where there was just 4-5 cities and one forest tile on Mars and the game was over and others where 10-12 cities and 15-20 forest tiles are on the board. 

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I really enjoyed it but I tend to enjoy card games where one builds tableaus and builds a bit of an engine. Did not play draft, but would prefer to going forward. Game production values aren't the best - poor insert, cubes are chipping already, etc. but the game play is excellent. There is obviously luck of the draw in play, but there is generally something one can do every turn. Played with corporations in play.

Holy smokes was this game a bolt lightening from the gaming gods! Ever since playing this game for the first time I have been obsessed with it and played it 2-3 times every week for four months now. One you get past the awful (but functional) graphic design and the amateurish art direction, the game is the best thing that has come out in the past five years, if not the past 10 years. Each game will be unique and there are different setups for those that enjoying playing different styles of games. Almost everyone I have taught this game to has wanted to either a) play it again immediately, or b) asked when they can play it again shortly after playing it. I am so obsessed with TM that I ordered a Broken Token insert for the game before I had even ordered the game.

The theme comes through pretty well, but although you're building an engine, the narrative arc is a bit lost. You pick up some cards and decide whether they fit with what you're trying to go, rather than developing an overarching terraforming strategy. I did enjoy it, but there isn't nearly enough interaction and it goes on a bit too long. 
There are some issues with the components and I suspect the cards will get "duffed" after a while.
I also suspect that the people that "learn" the game will destroy it for me. I'll rate it a 7 for now, but more likely to go down rather than up in the long term.

Very good, thematic Euro with some nice engine building aspects.   The game plays very well with all player counts (I'm surprised how well it played with two). Later turns can sometimes feel less interesting because sometimes if there are fewer opportunities for points and all the awards/milestones have been chosen. I prefer playing without drafting because of the vastly increased speed of the game.

Fairly heavy, but not incredibly complex. There are a lot of small middling rules that add interest but can sometimes develop into prioritizing minutia. A good engine building experience that feels very solitaire in nature. What is going on on the board has a bit of a disconnect from your card playing and tableau building. Game length is a slight issue, but keeps you focused for the entire duration. I couldn't recommend with more than 3 (or 4 MAX)
Overall good stuff, would play again, with the right people.

In diesem Spiel versuchen die Spieler gemeinsam den Mars bewohnbar zu machen. Es ist aber kein kooperatives Spiel, denn derjenige der es am besten macht gewinnt am Ende.
Wer am Zug führt 1-2 Aktionen durch und dann ist der nächste. Das geht Reihum bis alle spieler gepasst haben.
Aktionen sind Karte ausspielen und bezahlen, Karten vekaufen, Siegpunktprämien beanspruchen, Globale Parmeter erhöhen usw.
Wer am Ende das Meisste dazu beigetragen hat den Mars bewohnbar zu machen gewinnt.
Tatsächlich gab es ein paar knappe Situationen, in denen ich fasst meinen Anspruch auf die Prämie verwirkt hätte, da mein ganzes Geld schon wieder für die Runde aufgebraucht war. Es hat dann aber in der folgenden Runde doch noch geklappt.
Ein Spiel, das man öfter spielen sollte um die Karten und deren Effekte kennenzulernen. Ab der zweiten Partie kann man auch die verschiedenen Konzerne mit integrieren und dann auch die weiteren Karten mit hinzu nehmen. Für Anfänger ist das aber zu schwer, weil sie gleich zu Beginn Karten aus ihrer Starthand auswählen müssen, von deren Nutzen sie aber noch wenig bis keine Ahnung haben.
Mir gefällt das Spiel, allerdings wird es dem Hype darum auch nicht so gerecht wie ich das gedacht hätte. Es macht Spaß und funktioniert reibungslos, aber die Spielertabloes sind lapprig, die Marker darauf verrutschen und ein Inlay hat das Spiel 0,0.

Played a 5 player game and got bored by round 11. Too much luck in the cards and not enough flexibility to do what you want without them. Contains some pointless take that elements that will be enough to piss off people who don't like them and not enough to satisfy those who do. Needs to have some kind of action selection mechanism.

Also played solo and calculated that I was going to succeed based on my 'engine' by about turn 8, so didn't see much point continuing. 

This was the final straw for the most expensive game I've ever bought so I sold it.

RATING: 8
I myself have been able to play Terraforming Mars ten times and none of these games went the same way. This is mainly due to the number and order in which the projects become available. These projects decide especially in the beginning the actions that you can choose during your turn. The actions on the cards are very balanced compared to their price. It is therefore not possible that a player can immediately immediately increase his production of raw materials without having to submit in other areas. The cards are very diverse, but the final score in our games always seemed to be reasonably close together.

The manual of the game indicates that the game can last an average of 60 to 120 minutes. In our experience this is a bit longer, depending on how long players have to think about which projects they want to execute. In our experience, a game quickly lasted 3 hours, which may be a long time for some players. We found this no problem at all. Because each player can perform a maximum of two actions in succession, there is also very little downtime and waiting time between turns.

The game consists, on the player board, of very good components. During play, it occasionally happens that someone touches their own player board when they take a card or place a tile on the board. Sometimes the cubes are moved too easily and you do not know what your production value was. The system with the cubes for raw materials is very good, but perhaps a plate with relief had been enough to hold the cubes in place.

I like to join if someone asks me to play Terraforming Mars. For me, this is certainly one of the good euro board games of the past year. This game will definitely come out a few times in the coming months. Anyone who gets the chance to play this game should not miss that opportunity!

It's been a while since a game came along that so fully grabbed me. I've played this 9 times in 2 months and I'm still ready for more. It's gone from "hey I like this" to "game of the year" to "one of my top games ever" in almost no time. And last night, the 9th play, was the first time I used the advanced cards and drafting. Every play moves differently and everyone I've introduced it to seems to really like it.

Tentative assessment as a 9.  This is a very well balanced game with dozens of paths to victory.  No one route or type of resource dominates although they each have slight nuances.

Given that I've only had a 1st play-through (with all other players also playing for their first time) I can say that I would've made different choices, but that's no different from playing any other game for the 1st time.

Cons: Can difficult to learn, even for experienced gamers.  Most people will not pick up on every single nuance until about ¾ of the way through.  The first few turns consist of "playing in the dark" so to speak, but as long as everyone is playing for their first time no one is really sure which strategies to emphasize.

One of my favourites. Well worth investing in overlays for your player boards, or perhaps imitating my friend who downloaded the image for same and had them printed on mouse pads.

The expansion maps (Hells/Elysium) are well worth getting.

Venus Next I'm less sanguine about. Some of the cards are cool and interesting, ditto the corporations, but it seemed to detract rather than add to the base game.

Terraforming Mars is the game that got me into solo gaming. It has a awesome theme and the scientific feel it brings to the gameplay makes it a great game. The game economy is well balanced, even if sometimes card draw luck can be an impacting factor in success or failure. Replayability is very high and Hellas & Elysium add even more, introducing different placement bonuses on the board. I wish the production would have been better a bit. Also, the game lacks the ability to customize the difficulty and sometimes feels frustrating when card draw luck isn't in you favor. Only two multiplayer games among all Solo play. I really like the Objectives and Awards mechanics with other players.

I see three problems with this game:
- It takes a bit long time, and card handling takes too much time due to the extensive text
- It has some lacks in design compared to the prize
- After a while there are long ranks of cards at each player, with small text, so it is hard to get grip of the situation. This is depending on the number of players, bigger problem with bigger number.
- Also it might be too much luck which cards you get, but that might be that I have not played the game enough.

I do think this might be a good solo game, but have not tried it. So it might very well get a better ranking by me when I have played it more.

BTW, if playing with Venus expansion, don't forget the World Government. If playing without it you will extend the game needlessly.

Initial Impressions: About as good as I thought it would be: good but way overhyped. It is kind of like Imperial Settlers in that both are tableau builders where you are given a lot of options, and you have to figure out how to chain your cards together in the optimal order, to create a sprawling tableau that makes it difficult (although in this game not as bad as I feared) to tell what your opponents are doing. The differences are here you trade off having unique faction decks (yes the starting corporations are unique but I don't feel like they change up your playstle nearly as much), for tile placement, arbitrary scoring goals (which I don't like as it feels like a very artificial way to grant points) and a more sandboxy feel since you don't keep all your card options. 

There are a lot of different card combos and your starting corporatiom will make certain pathways better, so in that senseI assume there is a lot of replayability. However, the different strategies I sae in my first game all seemed to have a similar chain-like and mad grab for bonuses and points procedure. Despite my doubts if the different strategies actually feel different, I think I would probably find the engine building of this game addicting like Imperial Settlers, albeit the less slick nature of Imperial Settlers being a card game may make this game less so.

Im terms of the theme, they definitely did their research, but I don't know if it was evoked that well in the gameplay. It is kind of the same problem I have with Inis in that a lot of different things are referenced, but they are abstracted to all have similar effects.

Not sure how much luck of the draw plays out. Definitely drawing a card that combos with what you have on the last round can be huge, but perhaps there is enough adaptability that is required that card draw luck before that can be mitigated significantly, like Race for thr Galaxy.

Anyways, if you like modern euros where you are thrown a ton of cogs and have to piece them all togethet into a functioning engine, you will love this game. If you like elegant old school euros (not that this game is super inelegant), or want a strong mars theme, you may be disappointed, although I could see some people who are really into mars disagreeing with me themewise.

EDIT: I don't think the take that cards are that mean, but I still dislike them as they feel like such an artificial way to create interaction and stop a runaway leader.

I honestly don't understand all the people who say the game's components are unplayable without upgrading. Sure, a table knock can really mess up your income stats, but that is not unique to this game and it's easy to remember at least roughly what your stats were.

RATING: 6
Its an OK game. I wish there was more player interaction or more mobility to change strategy later on in the game. Another thing I didn't like was that the game is very easily 'solved' later on in the game. Even in the midgame you start to lose choices very quickly when certain choices become universally better than the others. In games like these the lack of much player interaction is usually made up for by the difficulty of player choice (i.e. that you need to figure out which option is the best for you) but this game does not have that so it comes off as a rather bland Euro.

My first two plays of this game- a definite 10.  Love the theme and mechanics.

After my third play- 7... maybe 6.

What happened during my third play definitely soured my opinion of this game.  We played the "normal" way with no card drafting (as we had done before). However, this time around my luck was abysmal. For the entire game I was getting very poor cards that did not help me get my engine going. Meanwhile, my opponent (2p game) was getting a ton of cards that perfectly energized with his corporation and strategy (Space corporation- got a ton of cards to boost titanium production, reduce space card costs, etc).  My engine basically languished and I was unable to do much while my opponent took an early lead and snowballed from there.

By the end of the game I was able to get my engine going slightly but I never really had a chance to catch my opponent. He took 2/3 milestones and 3/3 of the awards.  He doubled my score.

I still like this game but I am soured by the experience of getting whooped this badly due to very poor starting cards and other card draws during the game.

I hope this was just very bad luck and not something indicative of a greater problem with this game.

For all the hype I was expecting something far heavier, and far more strategic than what this game is. In the end, it's a tableau builder with a middling board element, with many similarities to Race for the Galaxy (as many before have made comparison).

In the end, it's a game I'm happy to play, but it's not as good as a few others from 2016.

Just tested yesterday the most actual version of the game. I was really looking forward to play the game, because i really like the theme and game idea. We played a 2 Player game and it was a terrible game experience, i declaimed my oppionion as the winner after 3 hours of playing, holding 17 cards on my hand, and dozens of resources to effort them. Very bad balancing and concept at this time right now, the game indeed needs a general workover. Please make a decision for the game: Create it as a card game or as an tile placement game, but not both. Implement one or two enjoyable game mechanics, i missed them at all. A game cannot exist with just draw cards, play them and get their benefit. Yes Magic - The Gathering works the same, but its much shorter and the main focus is battle action and taking out the opponent of life points and so i come to one more point: I really missing a game timer, this can`t be so hard to implement.

Keep working on this game, it has a lot of potential, but be more consequent with keeping and dismiss game features, its quite overloaded at this time.

With a variety of strategies on hand, one player was ahead of everyone the entire game in terms of scoring on the score track (did a lot of things to push the conditions of the Mars toward terraforming, but built nothing on Mars), yet came in second in a 5 player game, while the player who was in last place on the score track the entire game, but built lots of cities and projects and forests, and qualifying for rewards... ended up pulling ahead for the win (which happened to be me). 

So there are a number of strategies and you can't count anyone out who is trying to work it, even if they seem to be all the way at the back. I could see where I might not have quite pulled it off during certain critical turns, or kept the wrong cards, or even played the cards in a less ideal order. 

Everyone seemed to have fun getting there, too. The gameplay was surprisingly fluid and never felt like you got stuck for long, in terms of resources and what you can do with them.

This game is too hyped. The theme is awesome but the gameplay is rubbish. You just pile up stock, but you dont have enough actions to spend what you have stocked. So what do you get the next round...yess, more stuff you dont need or use. This game doesnt make sense. If you think you like this game, dont, just get settlers of catan. It basicly does the same, but at least lets you trade goods with a player/bank.

This was the hot game at one of my local conventions in the Fall of 2016.  I played both the basic and advanced game.  The advanced game is much more interesting.  You start with little income but a unique power for your company that is terraforming mars.  You are playing cards to improve steel, titanium, economic, green or energy capabilities.  There are three tracks for heating the planet, improving oxygen and creating oceans.  The advanced game features card drafting which can make the game run very long for what it is.  The game is solid and with more experienced players the drafting may go more quickly.  I liked the game and would play again, but I don't think it deserves the hype it is getting.  I know that the Dice Tower liked it but I see it as a good 7 game.  Component quality is ok.  I am not keen on the color scheme of the board.  It is not family but it is not too heavy either.

A really good aggro-engine builder game. Competitive, but player interaction is limited to moderately dirty tricks. You can not ruin other player's game, but there is a possibility to snatch some points they were expecting. The mechanism is fun and extremely polished, the rulebook is short and clear. Tile placement complements production(s) and hand managment like charm!
Best thing: The game offers tremendous replayability (more than 30 already accomplished, seems not to loose its momentum). Even italic texts are well invented and enhance the already strong atmosphere greatly. You really feel like a megaconcern gardening on Mars.
Worst thing: player mats could use some rework to hold production marker cubes more firmly. Parts are stylish, but cubes tend to loose some metallized paint.
Drafting method is recommended after the first game! Have fun!

Played this game at Broadway Games HQ. An advanced tableu building + a bit of area majority game, and the theme is definitely present despite the euro package. The icons are all very clear despite lots of information packed. I am on the verge of buying acopy, just being hold back by 2 points:
1. The randomness in the cards being dealt
2. The asynchronous art. Some are painted with a cyber feel, while some are photoshoped, but some are photos taken recently (I'm looking at you, Hackers), and the time should be 2400! I'd prefer all are painted/ homogenous.
Edited on 20/11/2017: played a 3 player game on 18/11/2017, and made me have some clearer thoughts on this game. In short, it simply takes too long for what it does, and when each player has 20 cards before them is simply too much for any tableau building game. The randomness mentioned before is shown again, as the inividual starting power is quite powerful PROVIDED THAT YOU DRAW THE CORRESPONDING CARDS OR SOMEONE PASS YOU ONE, it is quite luck dependent in that aspect. I would say 2 hour is too much for this level of randomness. (same reason why someone didn't love Florenza)

Good and fun tableaubuilding game. The mechanisms behind scoring and the race to fulfill the endgame parameters is excellent. Still think the draw fase adds to much randomness to the game though. Might well be a full 9 when I have tried out the drafting variant of aquiering new cards each generation. Hopefully this will also induce more interaction to the game, that I find be the only other small flaw to the game.

RATING: 7
First impression, after one 4p game.  Feels very introverted, like a good MPS.  Most of the time is spent looking at one's own cards, contemplating them and the board, very introspective.  Pace is slow, it takes time for the turn to come back to oneself.  There are many options partly driven by chance.  The game is well produced, has a nice theme, and feels like a good game, one that was tested and given a lot of care.  However, I feel that it is more solitaire and introspective than the games I usually enjoy -- fine choice if you just want to spend time alone with friends with light interaction.  It is possible that with repeated plays and more experience of the game the interaction opens up more, I can't tell with only one play under my belt.

Very fun game where theme fits the mechanics amazingly well. Might be a little too random for the 2 - 3 hour playtime though. Some people will certainly find the player interaction frustrating, since you can choose freely who's turn to fuck up.

The strength comes with the vast variety of cards; although some feels unbalanced, trying to get combos and collect different card types engages the players and makes it really fun. The design easily allows expansions to add extra cards, spicing up the game.

Wow what a game - similar to race for the galaxy (with a board) in that you play cards to build a tableau which will build some kind of engine to help terraform mars - has a little bit of everything - There are though 2 things this game falls down on - 1) the ridiculous price (£55) for some cards a smallish board and some cubes
2)the cheap player mats that dont hold cubes so that if the table gets knocked etc everyone losses track of their resource/money markers

Pre-ordered; Game includes many gaming-facettes from tile-laying over light deck-building as well as set-collection. It has a very high replayability, as there are more than 200 individual cards. However building greeneries and cities on Mars is essential for winning. Cards are helping by making this cheaper over the standard actions, but just collecting cards is not a viable win-strategy as most of the victory-points at the end come from tiles laid out on Mars.

Well designed game, and extremely thematic. My rating has been going down as I've played more though. It is a bit long for what it is, as the relative ordering of players is often established an hour before the game ends. I'm not terribly good at this game, and I think a part of that is that I get too into the theme and building cool stuff and don't treat it as the min/max Euro that it is. I think after playing a bunch, I feel there is too little interaction for my tastes, but too much for the Euro focus and multi-player setup.

2 main surprising points:
the drafting is the meat of the game
this game is deep yet keeps the fun and casual feel of a lighter game through so much riding on pivotal card plays

There are plenty of actions and tracks and such to keep track of but it never felt that convoluted.  Even though your building your own thing to do well you have to be watching other players.
I'm still not sure what player count is best.  It seems to be aiming for 5 but when drafting cards you are so disconnected from knowing whats out there.

Excellent tableau/engine-builder with some limited spatial elements.  

Something about this game just really works.  It's got lots of directions, works all kinds of combinations, and is simply fun.

Lots of controversy about the components and presentation.  I wish the cards had been all art and photos had been all together left to one side.  I'm not troubled by the components.

RATING: 7
Some of my favorite games are engine building games (Race for the Galaxy, Imperial Settlers, 51st State, Eminent Domain).  So, I was drawn to Terraforming Mars when I heard it was an engine builder with board manipulation thrown in.  A little extra to think about/consider while playing - sounds great!

Play Time:
This is easily a 2-3 hour game, even 2 player.  I don't see the play time dropping much with experience since it takes quite a bit of build up to get an engine going.   Now, don't get me wrong, I don't mind 2-3 hour games.  However, I'm used to knocking out heavier 2 player games in 60-75 mins, at the very most.   Just means this likely won't be a weeknight game and will be competing with a few other games for table time - such as Imperial Assault, Descent, Mombasa, etc.  This is more of a neutral point for me - game time is fine, but makes it a little harder to get to the table.  Luckily, game time doesn't really seem to increase with more players.

Complexity:
TM is definitely a medium weight game.  The rules are very straightforward with only a couple of tiny rules that could be easy to forget or mess up.  However, there are quite a few things to keep in mind as you play:
-Which milestone(s) do you think you can work towards?
-Same with the awards.  However, once the awards have been determined for the game, how are you going to make sure you can compete in those areas?
-What can you do to push up the global parameters with the current cards in your hand?  This is reevaluated every round.  
-With the point above, hand management is a huge part of the game.  How will you manage your current resources to get your cards played?  What can you do to help meet the requirements for vital cards? Which effective combos can you build?
-How will you get cities and greenery tiles out on the board for end game points?

Now, how does the play time and complexity compare to the other engine builders I enjoy?  
Race for the Galaxy (2 player): 
-20 mins
-Slightly lighter than Terraforming Mars due to not having to account for as many game mechanisms
-Lots of decisions are made in a very short play time

Imperial Settlers/51st State (2 player):
-45 mins
-The same weight as RftG (so a tad lighter than TM)
-End game (rounds 4-5) is where the complexity tends to hit since you've spent the first part of the game building up an engine that needs to be ran effectively at the end to win.  Sort of similar to TM in that regard.

After a few plays, I consider Terraforming Mars to be a very solid game.  

Update after 5 plays: I'm done with it for now.  May look into playing it again in the future since the first few plays were fun.  Didn't offer enough interesting decisions for the amount of playtime required.  I have a ton of other engine builders that were roughly the same amount of decisions making (but with more interesting decisions to make) and they all play faster.  Ramping up production took too long.  Bland engine building.  Really liked having an engine builder that tied into a map - that was the highlight of the game.

I was able to play this game at this years international tabletop day, and I will say it was fantastic. The different corporations give everybody a different power, yet still manages to feel balanced. The best way to play this game seemed to be to, for every round after the first, to draft the cards instead of taking the 4 you are given to decrease the likelihood of getting screwed by a random draw.
It was complex enough to be a bit difficult to learn, but still manageable to pick up without feeling lost. Honestly the worst thing about this game is the art and compontnets. The stock images they used feel so disjointed, but are easy to look past.

No denying this is a great game.  Two small issues prevent me from ranking it higher.  It felt like it ran about 30 minutes too long - would have felt perfect if it ended 2 turns earlier (was playing with 5). Secondly the cubes are mega fiddly and tough to grasp. Maybe small stackable tokens with numbers printed on them would have been better.

After playing 3 times, once with the corporation/draft, I'll say this right now: This is not a bad game and it's well-designed engine builder.

This doesn't mean it isn't overhyped though.  While the 2 to 3 hours you'll be making interesting decisions, most of the mechanics of the game boil down to getting cubes to score points or do fancy things with them.  Unlike most engine builders like Race for the Galaxy, there is a map portion that plays a much bigger role than one might realize, especially when playing with corporations.

That being said, my main problem I find with the game is most of the cards are variations of the same thing.  You'll have cards that allow you to turn cubes to cash, or turn cubes to other types of cubes, or reduce the cost of future card purchases.  Unlike most engine builders that I enjoy, such as Roll for the Galaxy or Scythe, there isn't various mechanics that completely change your view of the game.  Your engine is either going to be focused on combo making with your cubes or manipulating the map to your advantage.

This wouldn't be a bad thing if the length of the game was shortened to 20-30 minutes per player.  Unfortunately, this isn't the case.  The last game I've played we had 3 people who played Terraforming Mars twice and we've played with the Corporate Era and Draft mechanics.  The game took around 3 hours, which is far too long for a game with mechanics that are straightforward.  Unless your game is thick full of complex parts like Lisboa or Trickerion, your game should not go over the 2-hour mark with experienced players.  I would also never play this game beyond 3 players because the downtime would be too significant.

It doesn't help the game is overpriced for what you get.  The component quality is shoddy, the artwork is horrendous, and the playmats are complete utter garbage.  The fact that you can totally screw up the game with a simple accidental nudge is ridiculous.  If a game like Wasteland Delivery Express can come up with an amazing tray for their game while maintaining a reasonable price, Stronghold Games could've easily done the same thing for this game.  It's one of the most overpriced games I have ever seen.
.
In the end, I do enjoy this game and would only play it with 3 players, but there are so many alternatives that I would rather play over Terraforming Mars.  Games like Race for the Galaxy, Roll for the Galaxy and Evolution: Climate entice the same interesting decision-making and combo-making as Terraforming Mars but within an hour timeframe.

At first, I found the graphic design a turn-off; the game looks like it was designed by an engineer, not a graphic designer, and there's a lot of information to absorb at once. (It also makes the peculiar choice of having both iconography and text conveying the same rules on many cards, which I found off-putting.) Compounding that, for the first couple of turns I felt like I was just pulling levers with my eyes closed, making point salad.

But over the course of the game, everything fell into place and became intuitive. Turns became quicker, I was planning a few actions ahead, and I identified the course I was trying to chart to victory. (I came in second out of three.) By the end of the game, the story of Mars has been told -- the map suddenly green and full of oceans, and our individual corporations each having made their mark. It's neat.

I can see this climbing after another play or two, but for now it's a 7. There are plenty of other games in this time bracket that I'd rather play, but I'll happily play this again.

It's a good game, a bit complex for new playuers since every cards are unique(no duplicate).

If you have some friends with alcool the odds that someone move stuff by accident is pretty high since it's just plastic cube and it is really easy to move them.

Find the cards very thematic.

Easy to play, hard to get right.
Stratergywise picking which cards to pay to keep is difficult and all to east to take to many high value ones you end up not getting to play.

Getting combos is the trick to a good score, particularly with your corporation.  This is one reason recommend playing with the draft option as without it, can be to big a swing who gets the best combos.

The corporate variant made the game much better, giving more strategic options. All the different cards made it a quite interesting game. The only thing I do not enjoy much is the tile laying.

I like the theme and the three ending conditions (thematic; beautiful board too), but after playing once I feel I'm done with it since:

1) Too much card-reading, especially for newbies (e.g. during drafting, when planning sequence of actions) so easy to lose track (e.g. missing a particular condition or resource needed during the sequence). Never mind tracking all other players' abilities and what to prevent them from getting. I guess I can summarize as excessive rules / paperwork... I much prefer elegant rule sets in my games.

2) Runaway leader: There are a couple cards that allow you to damage other players, but these are rare. Even when we ganged up on the leader, it was obvious halfway through that they would win (they had a sequence of cards that gave them 3 VPs every generation!).

There's definitely some strategy there (not too much luck; just initial draft) but I feel the real overhead is *familiarity* with rules, cards, and distributions rather than depth of play. Even as a newbie who was lost/inefficient at first, my final score was comparable with people who owned the game and played many times (though not the leader, who had every card memorized, and could correct actions from across the table).

Believe the hype! This game is excellent! The cards, the CARDS...so cool. I replaced the player boards and the terraforming tiles before my first game. With those upgrades, this game looks pretty sweet on the table. Love it!

just hope it doesn't degenerate into a point-salad affair...

EDIT - I finally got to play this and I spent way too much time trying to figure out how to rate this game... at first blush this is JASE to the extreme... point salad, cube conversion, tile laying game with complex tableaus that are impossible to track by your opponents.  There's so little player interaction that this game could nearly be played simultaneously.  But the cards are so detailed, interesting, and spectacular... and cover such a broad scope... and are based on such an interesting premise... I can't rate this anything but a ten.  A non-boring Euro... seriously well played Fryx's!

FUN: this game does almost nothing new, but seems to do everything a little better than its predecessors.

UNIQUE: manages to simplify a very complex theme enough to create a smooth-playing game without dumbing things down.

NEGATIVES: takes a while to play and you'll be doing a lot of calculation during this time.

A tentative rating of 7 after first game (3-pl). I enjoyed the mid-game, when I understood what I was doing and some of what I wanted to do. Then the game became too long, especially with players optimizing towards the end, and it was still too multi-solitaire. Lots to like here, but the sum was not was I hoped for. I´m kinda interested in trying the drafting, though I´m afraid of the AP it will bring.

RATING: 9.5
Bought from Boardgameshelf 11/14/16.

Great game.  Feels a bit like Race for the Galaxy with its engine building / tableau building, but has an interesting spacial element and is a bit heavier.  The gameplay is quite intuitive, and it helps that the cards have their rules written out (in addition to iconography).  The production, however, is severely lacking - especially in terms of art.  The cubes are a bit fiddly, but that will be fixed with the Gametrayz.

Although the game runs a bit long with corporate era, it manages to cram in as much decision making as a heavier game like Trickerion, but doesn't feel like it has much downtime.  Both players end up so engaged in their next play that you don't quite feel the duration.

+ Simple gameplay, deep strategy
+ Elegant engine building
+ Good sense of escalation
+ Lots of crunchy decisions mean low downtime
+ Variable player powers / variable setup
0 Card draw determines a big chunk of the game
- Low proudction quality for price
- Fiddly cubes require aftermarket tray
- Higher play time

Avg Game Time (Corporate Era, 2P): Under 120 minutes

---
Update 11/21/16.  Rating increased from 9 to 9.5.  Played at 4 players and while downtime was higher (especially playing with one AP prone player), there was still so much to think about that the downtime wasn't very painful.  The game plays quite differently at higher player counts, with more emphasis on tile placement due to limited space.  Still loving the game and how different each one is.  I also find myself thinking more and more about different strategies.

Got this for Christmas from a fellow BGG.  Played 3, 2 and 4 player games in 5 days with the gifter, my wife and two other novice players.  I haven't explored many of the corporations, and I haven't played the solo or advanced economy variants, yet, but very much enjoyed the game,and look forward to playing many more times.  As good as Settlers of Catan in my opinion, although more complex.

RATING: 9
Positive: The corporations. The theme. The cards. The drafting. The milestones and achievements. This game has a lot to offer. There are a ton of different corporations to play. And while it seems that some may be stronger than others, I'm not quite sure that they are. A lot of this game is deciding when and what to spend your limited resources on. I believe that you can win a game of TM with any corporation, as long as you play it right. The theme of this game is really neat. The idea that we are all different companies trying to do the most to terraform Mars using things like Giant Ice Asteroids and Pets is a neat concept. In terms of the cards, there are TONS of them (I believe over 200) and every single one is unique. So what if you never get lucky and draw the card you need to win the game? That is why drafting is so great. You can only take one card from the four cards you drew and then have to pass the rest to the next person. I almost never have problems getting cards that I need. It's more common for me to get a bunch of cards that I want, but having to decide which ones to actually spend the money on, and which ones to throw away. There are many ways to score points in this game. Cards give you points. Cities and greenery tiles give you points. However, milestones and achievements are also very important. Every milestone costs the same, but there are only three that can be claimed. After that, nobody else can take any of the others that also offer the much needed five points. I think that achievements are done even better though. They become progressively more expensive as players buy them, but whoever buys them, does not necessarily win them at the end of the game. Brilliant. Also, I love your ability to take one or two actions on your turn. It makes for a real interesting way to stall on your turn to stay in the game to see what other people do.

Neutral: As with 51st State, player count is a neutral. The game isn't meant for one player count to be the best, but the more players there are, the less turns you have before Mars is terraformed and the game is over. Essentially, it's the same pie, but you just get fewer slices of it when there are more players. I think I like the game best at three players, then two players and finally four players. However, the solo mode is also well done and interesting. A second neutral is the artwork. I have heard a lot of people complain about the artwork in this game. On the cards, it is all over the place (clipart, photographs, drawings), and the board is attractive, but not beautiful. It doesn't really bother me at all, but it's also not very consistent which is strange.

Negative: The freaking components suck. This has been said by everyone that has every played this game, except maybe the publisher. The board is thin, the cards are thin, the resource cubes suck, the player boards without an overlay to keep cubes in place! What the hell were they thinking? I bought four overlay boards for my copy because if someone was to bump the table, your resources and cubes for tracking production would be everywhere. Even the box that the game comes in is thin and pretty weak. I digress. 

Final Decision: 9/10
I would probably give this fantastic engine builder a 9.5/10 if the components weren't so freaking awful. I would probably give this game a 8/10 if I didn't buy the overlays. Knocking my cubes all around the table would be an extreme annoyance. Overall, it's really a shame that the components bring down an otherwise very well done and thematic engine-building experience. I have yet to find another medium-weight game that can bring my non-gamer friends into the hobby and actually have them talk about it outside of game night.

RATING: 10
In Terraforming Mars, players are working together to terraform the planet by creating oceans, increasing the oxygen levels, and raising the temperature. However, this is not a cooperative game in any way. You are working as independent corporations, trying to best capitalize on the red planet. You do this by playing cards, building cities, growing forests, and purposeful global warming.

Pros:

+ Right amount of tactical card play and strategic decisions.
+ Forces you to have a different strategy every game.
+ Theme is heavily integrated and works well.
+ Appeals to a wide range of game players.
+ Fantastic card engine building.
+ Asymmetrical powers and setup.

Cons:

- The game length does not scale to the number of players. A 2 player game is not much longer than a 5 player game.
- Long game. It runs around 2 - 3 hours.
- Mediocre component quality.
- Player boards are awful. It is too easy to bump the table and mix up your resources.
- Card play can be really random at times. The more players, the more the random elements will effect the game.

Final Thoughts:

Rating: 10 / 10: Terraforming Mars is a brilliant game that integrates a card tableau / engine building mechanic with solid thematic elements. The game combines the right amount of tactical card play with long term strategic decisions. The random nature of drawing cards, though there is an option to card draft, allows for a unique experience each play-through. These random elements force you to adjust your strategy each time you play the game.

Terraforming Mars is not for everyone. It has flaws. It is long. It is random. The component quality is mediocre at best. Despite these flaws, I find that I'm constantly thinking about how my engine will turn out the next game. Terraforming Mars works with all player counts, but I prefer it with three or four players. It's a game that is frequently back to the table and it is easily one of the best game of 2016. It deserves a spot as one my all time favorite games.

Unlike some, I really like the odd, mismatched card art, I think it goes a fair way to making this game more aesthetic. Particularly as you spend most of your time staring a your resource tracker, which ain't so pretty.

Most euro games lack context for me, in this I genuinely feel like I'm in the setting. Buying into certain projects to build a functioning business. The actual terraforming of Mars is secondary to this as rightly your own interests come first!

The awards and milestones add extra motive and give this euro a little edge over most.

RATING: 5
This is basically an even more overly long version of Imperial Settlers, with some Race for the Galaxy mixed in.  If you like watching a runaway leader for 2 hours this is the game for you, and while runaway leaders happen in RftG it has the excuse of being a 30 minute game, as well as simultaneous-turn-based.

* Bash-the-leader take-that
* Imbalanced cards and luck of the draw
* If you're doing well you'll be able to take more turns, while everyone else passes and dies from boredom

Engine building is phenomenal, and being scientifically sound adds to it.  Being able to control the pace of the game by accelerating/decelerating the advancement of terraforming goals depending on your need to end the game quickly or slowly is a very interesting dynamic.  Take-that is extremely minor, and the game could possibly even benefit from having just a bit more of it to help rein in a runaway leader, which there's basically no way to do as the game stands.  Even the disappointingly sub-par component quality can't dampen my enthusiasm for the game.  Wonderful game!

Full Review available in the game forum.

In 2016 at GenCon I was going to either buy this game or Mombasa. I didn't get a chance to try TM and did get to play Mombasa so the latter was the one I bought.

One year later, I own Terraforming Mars and I initially made the wrong choice. This game has a lot going for it!

Scoring is points salad, core mechanic is engine building. 

Pros: Theme is excellent. The game doesn't feel long. Decisions are interesting.
Cons: Unlikely to generate awesome board game stories. 

Definitely a game to own. Might consider the expansion even though I've only played once.

Update: slight downgrade. Really takes too long for what it is.

Good game, though apart from a race for milestones largely multiplayer solitair. Thematically well done. However, I had expected more of the card play. Not really combo-play, just build the cards you can afford and put them down on your tableau, after which most of them have no in-game function anymore. I would like to play this more often, I like card driven games. But is it really something special to rave about? That is not the case. Tableau building games like Zhanguo or Deus are way ahead of this with more advanced card mechanisms. TM plays away very easily and doesn't go very deep.

This game has some serious replayability potential due to the surprising amount of combo one can create with the cards.

It's rapidly becoming one of my favorite game.  In essence, In this game, you build an engine to produce more of something.  That something is what you transform in currency to either go on the planet proper or activate actions that gives you VP at the end of the game.  

In our group, we always play card drafting, which make for longer games but which make fond moments : " Oh **it, you wil love this card" or "this time around, can we keep 2 cards instead of one?"  hihihihihih

It could won the award of best worst game. It is a really good game that it is really awful looking. Pieces are really small, boring and all look the same, and hard to play sometimes. Theme is only coming from cards, that are really thematic but at the end you only look for the efects. Quality of components is less than average, and moving the resources is hard sometimes. And also. iconography is bland and boring. It hurts putting an 7 considering how awful it looks, but the game is sensational. In fact, with better components would be a 9 or even 10.

One player drew all of the income cards and was able to do twice as much as the rest of us... Literally double 3 of the 5 players points. Money seems to be the only way to do anything, therefore being the only way to victory. I prefer games where there are multiple strategies/paths to victory.

4/3/17 just had my second play, and it was a completely different game. This time we drafted 8 cards every round, instead of the random 4. Getting so many options every turn really helped your own strategy as well as blocking others from getting the cards they wanted. The game took FAR too long for what it is doing this, but it was still a very fun game. I would like to try drafting 5 cards, or only keeping the option of buying 4 of the 8 just to speed along the drafting phase, however no one had played the game more than once before, which was another factor to why the game took as long as it did. With this game's popularity, I know I will get another chance to play this one, and it could possibly get a higher rating the more I play it. Time will tell.

As so many in the community I did not have this game on my radar. After playing it for the first time I instantly fell in love with the game. The game covers the theme perfectly and is rich of atmosphere. It ist complex but not complicated and with the over 200 projectcards it has lots and lots of replayability. I like constructive games with a lot of different possibilities to score Points, placing tiles, generating majorities, find out fancy card-combos and manage resources. TFM has all of this in a perfect mixture of strategy and tactics. There are not so many games out there which deserve a 10 - but this one deserves a 10 definitivly! Highly recommended!

RATING: 3
I am tired of this push toward games that are designed to be replayed rather than played. With a huge deck of unique cards, no one could possibly know what they're doing on a first play. This game is for those who have decided to become Terraforming Mars players.

I know that all games reveal their strategies over multiple plays and that experience yields better play. That's not what I'm talking about; a first-time Puerto Rico player will get clobbered by experienced players, but he will still be able to grasp how the game works and make decisions accordingly.

In a first game of Terraforming Mars, how could you know that you should hold on to Card# 51 because it and the yet-to-be-drawn Card# 163 will combo very nicely with your corporate power? You wouldn't, because the game is not designed for you to know until you've already played it.

This is what I'm talking about. This game caters to the breed of player who loves committing to long, heavy games and doesn't mind the game not clicking until a future play. Fine for them. For me, I want to be able to play a game with people outside of its fan club.

All that being said, I found nothing fun about playing this and for a game featuring a common map being built upon by all players, I was surprised how much this game feels like solitaire; the tableau is the game, not the map, and the map is what caught my interest. And holy crap is it long.

Also, what are arbitrary attack cards doing in such a long, complex game? Am I suddenly playing Milles Bornes? They're aping Dominion's tacked-on attempt to inject interactivity into their game. "Say, this game feels like solitaire." "Ummm, throw in some attack cards?" "Brilliant!"

May be the greatest designed board game ever created! My new favorite, really is a landmark in design. The choices are mind boggling, how the cards interact with each other. I stand in awe of this game, brilliant! Almost forgot to mention, the replay ability is off the charts.

Great variety of cards and elements in play.  Love the shiny currency pieces.  The flexibility of how many players can join the game is perfect.  The learning curve takes several rounds to get up to speed, which is just about perfect as well.  I look forward to playing it more.

Enjoying the solo aspect of the game as this is a tough one to get the family on-board with as they don't much care for the euro's and the game groups a tough one to get out with as its fairly long.  Like the science feel but it doesn't promote much in the way of player interaction, which might be why I like the solo varient.

Sadly, this game is overhyped.  It is a very solid game, but it has too many issues.

The easily bumpable player boards is the least of its issues.  The theme is really present, until the game gets into swing and the theme drops away as you puzzle over more cards with more interactions.  The card draw luck is significant, which can be mitigated by the drafting variant, but that adds to game length and the game is already too long for what it is.

The issue is that there are simply much better engine building games.  This one seems deep at first, but it's so open that card draws are the determining factor.  The choices become mathematical rather than clever.  After several plays, it feels more and more tactical and less strategic.  However, hovering over all of this is that the game has too much down time and is too long for it's depth and luck.

My only guess is that the many new BGGers that have come to the site in recent years simply haven't experienced a decently thematic engine builder of medium complexity.  When I can play Race for the Galaxy 4 times instead of playing this once, and I'm actually interacting with my friends, it's hard to recommend Terraforming Mars.

This has been getting lots of table time, lately and no one is bored with it, yet. I have a great time playing, but I am not very good at it ...

I have watched this being played enough times to weigh in with absolute confidence that this game is exactly as deadly as wandering around on Mars without a spacesuit. The main difference being that you die of boredom rather than whatever it is that kills you first on Mars, which for all I know could also be boredom.

Seriously, you're planting trees and creating oxygen and placing cities and pushing a bunch of cubes around for no apparent reason, and wow here comes a card with a volcano, but it's the pointless kind of volcano which doesn't wipe out your civilization in a glorious wash of superheated stuff that comes out of volcanoes like in movies. And there's a card with a puppy. Oh, back to the trees and cubes.  Okay, time to count your trees and cubes and puppies--okay, I'm not sure if you count puppies--and shiny things. And...oh, too late, everyone has died.

I feel very confident that a large majority of people on this website would rate this game about an 8.4, a number which I totally did not look at in the upper leftish area of my screen while I was typing. This probably proves something about the appalling taste in games of the sort of people this site caters to. But I don't want to be impolite, so I won't say anything more other than to again mention the word "appalling." And "nauseating." And "good gravy, it's like having a fat squirrel living in your hair, and even though he is polite and fairly sluggish, he has an overactive bladder." But no more. I don't want to be impolite. 

In addition to obvious queries like "What's for dinner?" and "What's that thing over there?" I feel sure you are asking yourself, "Why is this internet person who I've never met but care deeply about watching people play this game so much?" Well, the answer is long and complicated, and it involves octopods and beets and voodoo spells and general stupidity. But in its simplest form, the explanation is that sometimes the vicious, painful realization of just how stupid a thing is that I am doing is not enough to overcome my laziness. Also, I wanted to see if the puppy would survive. Spoiler alert: There are no puppy-shaped spacesuits.

I really like this one. With the 208 different project cards there are plenty of opportunities, to develop. Especially with the Company cards there are even more possibilities for different direction of your developments. By the ongoing Terraforming and the growing cities and forests some projects become more attractive while others might be better played earlier. Your growing economic and production extend your action range. I like the enormous variety, which comes mainly through the interaction inbetween the different types of projects and the ongoing Terraforming. So in one round you might drop a project, because it seems worthless to built. Next play this might look completely different if the surroundings have changed and you would even pay twice to keep it. Really nice game with good mechanics, fitting graphics, clear symbolic, atmospheric game play, perfectly implementation of the theme, lots of different possibilities and strategies and still a low down time. That's the kind of game, what I really like and want to play again and again. For me a clear 10 and one of my favorite games at the moment. Hopefully we will not find any bigger bug. It seems nearly to good to be true...

I really like this game so far.  The variety of the cards lead to very different approaches and resulting play styles.  Most of it makes good sense, so after learning about the icons you are good to go.  Not too complex, but enough science in there to be somewhat believable and interesting.  One of the best of the 2016 Essen crop.

Played my first solo game and it also went well.  Lasted about ninty minutes, and lost by two degrees of temp, which translated into being six money short.  Dammit, the score would have been decent, as well!  Looking forward to teaching the game to my son.

Feb '17:  played against my son for the first time and he really liked it!  We even got to talk some science, which was an added bonus.  Final score came out very close.  Both of us more interested in making cool stuff than winning, which can be accomodated by the game as well.

May '17: My son joined a game against the main group, and held his own.  The game ran close to 3.5 hours, so I was proud he held in there.  He lost, but came close.  I came second: my opening hand really put me against the wall!

I can't see any reason to play this over something like 51st State if I'm looking for an engine building card game. Moments of interaction and excitement are scarce, and progress is painfully incremental so that the engine takes forever to take off. It plays like it looks.

Wow - loved this game...

There are so many strategic options, and it gave me the delicious RFTG stress of trying to acquire/hold onto the cards to pursue 50 different strategies while knowing that I really have to narrow my focus down to 2 or 3.

The weight of the game is also just right for me right now - crunchy enough to be interesting for a couple hours, but not so crunchy that you have to play multiple times to understand what is going on...

For me at least, this game lived up to the hype.

A cool euro/hybrid game by the great guys at Fryxelius!
Very cool engine builder that does have a bit of a mean streak.

I think mechanically it's a very sound game that could very be one of the best with some house rules for myself.

I will likely edit the deck to remove cards that are just mean or seem pointless.
I will only ever play with drafting.
I will house-rule a way to draw cards during gameplay (like pay 5-10MC to draw 3 cards and keep 1 as an action.

RATING: 8
Very good euro, not very complex, with very stream-lined mechanics. While explaining the nuances takes some time, it's actually a very simple game to play and easy to pickup. Unlike most Euros, Terraforming Mars seems to have a lot of viable strategies that you can follow in order to achieve victory, and they're more or less balanced.

The one thing you need to watch out for that scores big though is getting cities with forests around them. That's really a big key to victory, but how you afford those forests and cities is very variable. This is one of the few Euros I know, like Five Tribes, where you have a lot of ways to success that are equally viable.

There's so much to do, so many paths to take. I'm really looking forward to next play. Very nice and well implemented theme too. I am tempted to house-rule something for the aggressive cards, but I get a feeling that it's all thought out somehow, so I'll wait until I know the game inside out. Which, however, will take an eternity, since there are so many dimensions in there. Next time, I'll try to set aside a lot of time so we can really allow each other to figure out a strategy rather than just jump in and see what happens, although that works too; the complexity is in the strategy rather than in the rules.

Wow. This game is just wow. I love this game so much. No matter how well i do or how poorly i do its just too much fun. The game even got better once i started adding the drafting mechanic. I wont say much more especially because of how highly this game is already rated on bgg. But i do want to speak to the player count and component quality. The game should be rated from 1-4 players, 5 is a three hour game. Too long. The counting pieces, gold, silver, copper cubes are cheap and should be much nicer. Same with player boards. They needed to be much thicker. This game cost me $70 and i was quite disappointed in the component quality. I still love it so much and a third party upgrade is brilliant for this game when upgrading player boards.

RATING: 7
After my first play, I was luke warm to the game. Things I did and didn't like. Felt way overhyped as it's problems seemed large, but still had a lot of interesting gameplay. 
My second play was a ton more fun (I scored great both, so that had nothing to do with it). What I didn't like about my first play was that it felt way too long for having the lucky card draws of Race for the Galaxy.

The draft theoretically helps mitigate this, but grinds the game into the painfully slow territory that doesn't nearly make up for it's small gain. I feel I was on average the slowest drafter, so it's not like it increased my personal down time, but did wreck the flow (a highly undervalued game play attribute). Also, because of how you have to buy the cards (and how money is tight), the leftovers you get from a draft are even less valuable than in standard drafting games. There just is not enough benefit of the draft to outweigh its disadvantages. This was highly surprising to me as I had the exact opposite preconceived notion.

Both times I played with the asymmetric corporation cards, and with starting resources at 1. I can't imaging the game being better without these (with new or experienced players), but I was wrong about drafting being important, so maybe I'm wrong about this too.

OVERSIMPLIFIED SUMMARY:
With that second play, I was ecstatic to see there was a diamond in the rough. But it's a non-draft diamond, and a draft turd.

Mechanics, objectives, and cards all highly relevant to a great theme.  Many ways to win.

Multi-player and solo games vary in their objectives (VP vs reaching thresholds in time), but both are VERY enjoyable.

A great engine building game that is very themic and feels epic in scale. It is nice to build an engine with cards and make killer combo's. I prefer starting at 0 production with all the cards and drafting. The draft adds time, but makes the game more interactive. This is what is lacking a bit from the game as a whole. For a game that takes about three hours to play (even with two) I prefer a little more interaction. Components are a little lacking, especially the player boards and bad card art. That is why I rate this a 8 and not a 9.

What's it like to start life on a new planet? Terraforming Mars is nothing like that, but it is extremely fun anyway. This game does make you feel the chaos of starting a colony by having so many different ways to score points and help the planet get its footing. Being a relative novice when it comes to my whole strategy gameplay, this was easy enough for me to comprehend the @$$ kicking that I received and feel ok about it at the same time. As soon as I finished I wanted to do it again, play the game, not get my @$$ kicked.

You always hear people complain about the components and what not, but it's the way the game plays that's most important to me, and boy, this one's not lacking. It's currently my favourite game. I love engine builders, and it's one of the finest. The game takes 3-4 hours in my groups, but I don't feel the passing of time. When it nears the end, I always want it to last a bit more, so I can build this card and that one. When you get to draft cards, you want to buy them all, but you certainly don't want to let player to your left get this or that one. The game keeps you engaged the whole way through; you have to balance short and long term strategies... I'm gushing, but there's so much to love about this game.

It was hard to ignore the popularity of TM so I gave it a try. The first time I played it (2 Player) I was disappointed. It seemed too long and I was not impressed with the drawn out end game. But I found myself thinking about it and looking forward to a second try. We used the designer variant that entails moving one of the terraforming factors forward each turn. That shortens the game somewhat. I've now played it ten times (all two player) and find TM absolutely absorbing. Yes, there is some luck in the card draw. Yes, the end game can get a bit fiddly. Yes, it is derivative of many other Euros. But the copious card selection, coupled with the interesting territorial dance on the board is what makes the game so interesting. We like the fact that more familiarity and experience enhances your skill. In essence TM features a fascinating series of interconnected economic systems, dressed up in science-fiction garb. As a huge fan of Kim Stanley Robinson's great science fiction novels, I'm delighted to see the Mars series come to life in a board game. TM is robust and worthy of exploration. Expansions will provide an opportunity to tinker with the system even further, especially in terms of linking board and card play, and possibly making the game tighter for two players. I'm sure the drafting approach mitigates the random factors somewhat. But I don't mind some luck in my games. And I can't blame luck for the fact that my wife regularly wins! We find that even with the variant referred to above, TM takes us two house to play. But we're sufficiently absorbed and entertained. Excellent first effort and a true labor of love.

Played yesterday and it was an awful experience.
We played with 5 players so it might have been a little bit better with 3 or 4. 

But still:
- it took us 3,5 hours and I can not see it coming down under 2 hours
- it felt like Race for the Galaxy and does ALL THE THINGS worse than Race
- so many unnecessary components
- Resource and VP markers just get knocked around the board

Don't want to play again. And definitely do not understand the hype. Play Race already and get over this. I am sorry.

SPIEL 2016

Very good thematical game with a good combination of hand management, economic motor and tile laying with awards and milestones goals. Plays very swiftly! Only downside is the clumsy rulebook and the thin player boards. Until now the best game of 2016 together with Clank!

Update 03/02/2017: I'm downrating the game from 9 to 6. The game is very much take-that with 2 players, a little bit too much for my taste. Secondly, game lasts around +2.5 hours which is just too much to see it on the table very regularly. Third, after playing for several hours, it seems like the scores are too tight in the end. In both games we played, scores of first and 2nd/3rd player differed with 1 point only which is very marginal and one take that action made the difference between a win or a loss.

After all, it's a good thematic game with a lot of interesting scientific events that make sense. A game I like but not love because of the long play time, the take that cards and the tight end game scores and the flimsy production counters.

Component quality is also so-so - with all the lightweight cubes on the flimsy score boards, one sweep with the arms of a nearby kid would wash 3 hours of game play away in one move... luckily it didn't happen to us but I just imagine... sold my copy

Great thematic game based on the colonisation of Mars. Action cards define your options in every round. Limited income and conditions linked to each card are a basis for making these decisions.
Although there is a central board, interaction is limited since you have to play what the cards dictate you and you cannot anticipate the cards of your adversaries.
It might have been the hit of Essen 2016 but apart from the theme, I couldn't found anything interesting in this game.

Played this at a convention and nearly missed out on this gem. What happened was that it was getting a bit late and there were five of us looking for a game. Once chap suggested we try Terraforming Mars as he hadn't read the rules or anything but had watched the first hour of a game earlier in the day and was confident he could explain it all. None of the rest of us had any experience with the game but were up for a challenge. Terraforming Mars was also getting pretty good 'buzz' so we were keen to see what it was all about.

So, we sat down to play and really struggled with just about everything. After about 30 or 40 minutes the 'rules observer' pretty much said "Sorry, guys. This is beyond me". At that point we could have quit and tried something else but we persevered, fumbling our way through one trial turn.

Then it clicked.

Once we worked out how the game worked all five of us really got into it and found ourselves absorbed in the game. It worked and worked very well indeed. Plenty of challenging decisions, great art and gameplay that really captured the theme. The only criticism I'd venture is that the player mats could be better designed with indentations and suchlike to stop tokens sliding about in the course of play.

I probably won't buy this as It wouldn't get much of a run in our house, but I would definitely play again.

After 4 plays, dropping rating from a 6 to a 5. There's nothing wrong with this game per se, but it just doesn't grab me. It feels too similar to Race for the Galaxy, which I don't enjoy much. I thought the drafting would help, but it doesn't do much for me except drag the game length out just a bit more, and it already feels too long. Everyone else in my game group seems to love this game, but I just find myself wishing we were playing something else.

My first Meetup game. Really enjoyed playing and almost won! Finished three points behind the guy who'd played it 15+ times. Felt like a mash-up of parts of a lot of different games - tile placement from Suburbia, card selection from Millennium Blades, resource generation from Eclipse.

RATING: 10
Excellent game. Competitive, but not overly antagonistic, interesting idea that you don't want the game to end to soon in order to claim VPs.  Game components are reasonable, but probably not good for the price. Would like to see a supplier for real metal cubes, and the player mats need laminating and possibly overlays. But focus on the game, not the pieces, and 100% satisfaction guaranteed.

The heart of this game is a big deck of 208 unique project cards.  The cards are thematic and varied: it's like "Bruges" in Space!  The gameplay centers around the slow increase in a player's ability to produce the game's commodities.   The collection of tags reminds me of "Innovation" - but it doesn't have the wide diversity of swingy effects that you find in Innovation.  It's definately a cooler, calmer game.

Pros:
Neat theme.
The potential for building a fun engine is there.

Cons:
Too much RNG in the small card selection. (May be due to expansions)
Not nearly enough interaction between players.
Attack cards seem interesting, but the opportunity cost of playing them in a 3+ player game makes them into dead cards.
Game duration is also way too long.

Played with the card drafting variant—without drafting, my rating would be lower. I'm not sure where the hype is coming from.

The ability to make things—whether on the board or in your tableau—makes it feel like there's always something (often, too many) good things for you to do on your turn. By offloading most of the complexity to cards, Terraforming Mars feels more accessible than it otherwise could have been (similar to Food Chain Magnate—maybe there's a design trend here?). By the end of my first game, the iconography was second-nature, and the card text was helpful for clarification.

The game seems to be about building a resource engine to score points in a number of different ways, trying to play synergistic cards to produce or score more efficiently. Given the infrequency of many cards, however, these synergies seem to require much more serendipity than in, say, Race for the Galaxy. With so many cards, holding out for the right cards to optimize your engine seems unwise.

I don't get the hype. Everything you see here has been done already, maintaining the sums and productions is quite a chore and it's full of cards needlessly screwing other players in the worst possible mechanism:
- YOU chose whom to screw
- YOU get nothing of it, just the smug feeling.
I don't even see particular connection between the theme and the mechanisms, as everyone is praising. Stopping terraforming-rating, as soon as there is 14 % of oxygen, when Mars' gravity is one third of that of Earth and we here need around 21 %? Why the money from building next to oceans? Why is there a dedicated field for cities?
And above all, why is the iconography so FUGLY? It looks like a prototype, including the production quality.

The game definitely isn't bad or stupid. However, Imperial Settlers have quite the same feel (and samely prone to randomness), while being less of a chore and less unnecessary evil.

Looks pretty luck based.. We should definitely do a few more runs, and definitely not with the beginner version..

I still am confused if I like the change of pace when number of players change.. Will see..

Edit: After a few more runs, it is much more solid in my mind and satisfying to my taste. A well deserved 9/10!

Edit2: A year after its release and it is still the most played game of our group, gonna go for a 10/10 :)

Wife surprised me with this for xmas 2016.  Mechanism is really easy to pick up.  Several solo games in and it is clear that there is a lot to learn.

Still great fun to play but quality and longevity are very disappointing for a premium price point game.

As a solo game, Terraforming Mars shines bright and red. Each game unfolded quite different for me. There is a luck-of-the-draw complication that presents itself more heavily in multiplayer games. Though I feel the potential lack of balance isn't a dramatic effect, you can reduce it using the draft variant. It's thematic, and puzzley, and wonderfully combo-tastic - with a lot of moves potentially tricking off each other.

RATING: 5.5
Mixed bag. The theme is fascinating--I love smacking asteroids into the planet or playing cards that give you microbes or plants or kelp. The game is not particularly interactive, aside from some crude "zap" cards, and takes ages to play, but it's a soothing experience wrangling cards into an engine and plopping down aquifers and greenery. The most interesting and only original mechanism in the game is the way that players pay money/cubes to specify the endgame goals.

The bad stuff: a really pricy game is basically unplayable unless you buy custom player mats for YET MORE MONEY, because otherwise you will inevitably jostle your cubes and counters midgame and TOTALLY LOSE TRACK OF EVERYTHING--there is basically no way to recover. Lazy dumb design--just use pieces that don't slide so easily. -- And for that pricetag I want something a lot prettier than this game--the card art is random and sometimes terrible.

[after another play] .... OMG I wanted to die after a while. So slow, and AP-prone players just kill this one.

Also, I'm wondering if the complexity and copiousness of the cards is a mirage. Especially if you get a corporation with a good-sized starting fund, often just paying straight up for greenery, aquifers and asteroids is a more effective use of money than bothering putting cards into play at all. Like, you could barely ever draft any cards and often do just fine.

First game took about 2 hours or so. Still looking to play this again!

Wow! What a game that plays so differently in solo mode as in multiplayer mode.
In solo play the game poses a very hard challenge to complete the terraforming in just 14 generations. With no card drafting and the extended card set this makes for a lot of replayability with each game requiring a different approach.
In multiplayer mode the game is a superb engine builder with different corporations giving a different focus for each player. The card drafting variant is essential to limit the randomness of the card draw.
This is only the second game I have rated a 10 - mainly due to the solo game experience.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

This is a great engine building sci-fi game. It might add a little time but doing a card draft each round makes the game much more strategic instead of what you just randomly draw.

Enjoyed this way more my second time around. Not only is the subject matter great, but they support this with scientific concepts using the cards. There are two things holding back TM for me, however. One is the length. For such a simple game, I wish that it could ramp up and finish a but faster. The other thing is that the game lacks a sense of urgency. In Race for the Galaxy, I want to score a bunch of points while being mindful of the amount of cards my opponent has. Here I feel like I'm in a bit of a sandbox. At the same time, however, this is probably my favorite game of "building stuff" in a relaxed and satisfying way. Something that Uwe Rosenburg attempts to do in many of his designs, but I still feel like it eludes him. It's difficult to gauge how you're doing as the game goes along, but I enjoy this anyway. Could be my favorite game from 2016 at this point.

Swedish designs are rare and I was very curious to see how Terraforming Mars stood a comparison with other acclaimed games. When I finally got to play the game, I could appreciate the effort put into the engine building mechanics. But there are many buts.

Terraforming Mars is one of many examples of how loads of cards does not equal depth since you can't plan which cards you draw and their impact on the common game board is too small. Furthermore, the attempt to fix the luck of drawing the right cards with drafting only adds to the playing time while the attempt to fix the low interaction with take that cards is just annoying. The result is a way too long multi-player solitaire that ends with a big hand of cards rather than a terraformed planet. Terraforming Mars is a well crafted game with a unique theme but somehow I feel that an opportunity was lost here.

I've only played the game solo so far, and enjoyed it. Decisions need to be made in regards to buying, selling and playing cards, projects and resources.

Not quite the greatest game evah, and certainly with its flaws, but impressive and rock solid for all that.  Reminds me of the love child of Imperial Settlers and The Castles Of Burgundy, but still manages to inhabit its own space and comes with an intriguing solo mode that is different enough from the competitive game to keep it fresh and alive.  Not sure I agree with the open game-end conditions that sometimes needs a player to nudge the others over the line, but decent fun for all that.

A very disappointing experience.

The cards you play only synergise in very limited ways so you don't really get a chance to build towards any meaningful "engine". I didn't feel there was much meaningful interaction between the players, so the downtime felt lengthy. The decisions were never particularly meaningful (you either did a thing or did a less good thing). The play time was long, but shallow.

It's not the worst game I've played, but it's definitely one of the highest hype to disappointment ratios I've seen in a while...

The economy of the game was interesting and the wide variety of cards available made for interesting decisions and tactical play.  The game ramps up as you go, starting at a crawl and building to a sprint by the end.  The game has some take that, but the choice to use it is optional and did not derail players in my play.

RATING: 8.5
Each player controls a corporation in Mars, attempting to make it more hospitable. In this card driven game, you are dealt a number of cards, and your first decision is to decide whether or not to pay for each card. In the game, your resources are money, steel, titanium, plants, energy and heat.  You are trying to raise your terraform rating (TR), which is your VPs. By getting rid of heat, you raise the temperature, and advance your TR. Similarly, by planting greenery, you advance oxygen, which also raises your TR. The cards range in various costs, allowing you to increase production in some areas, gain advantages, plant greenery tiles, and so forth. 

There are 5 milestones in the game, and once 3 of them have been reached for 5 VP each, no more milestones can be attained. Similarly one can fund awards in various areas to earn VPs. 

There are standard actions such as building a city, adding an ocean tile, planting an greenery tile so you don't have to rely on cards. 

This is a very good tense game, You are racing to get the milestones, and you are trying to make sense of your cards. You are trying to optimize your engine, but other people might have beaten you to a certain objective. Most of all, the fun is the interaction of the cards and trying to create combinations that might match and give you an advantage.  Each game is very different. My only criticism of this good game is that  a few of the cards feature "take that" against your opponents and I'm not fond of games that do that, but in this game, they are not crippling, but they can slow you down.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Interesting engine builder that is mostly a race to accomplish the various goals first. I like that the game ends when you have achieved the objective. I suspect this game feels deeper than it really is as the optimal strategy seems to be making a plan based on your early cards and then simply executing that plan more efficiently than your opponents.

Very good game! It's a real pleasure to discover the cards during the first plays. The past discovery, you know better the different strategies that you could follow. There are a lot of strategies and every game is different: the draw of the cards, the placement on the board and the different corporations you can represent give a good replayability. The interaction is present with some effects of card, the placement on the board or the claim of the objectives and rewards before the other players. The tension is here. For some aspects, it reminds me Race for the galaxy. It's important to adapt your strategies to the drawing cards and choose your card to keep according to two or three definite strategies, otherwise you can quickly lose yourself. I played it a lot with two players, around 2h30 for a game but it's also a good game with more players. So it's a long game but you don't bother. The rules are not complicated and logic. I really recommend it to all players (except for family) and it can be a good gateway game to heavier games.

I would not recommend playing with 5 players. The artwork for this game is awful. You have pictures, illustrations and 90s 3D renders on cards which seems like they googled and put them on cards. I have no reason to play this over caverna, scythe, terra mystica, etc.

Only one play in, but great gaming experience! It does take some time depending if you include the extra project cards. The player mats get a bit crowded and can easily be bumped. I highly recommend doing the card draft (in the rules), it can really help you get useful cards. Rulebook a bit disjointed, you have to flip back and forth to find the rule you need. Also don't bother with the beginner corporations, the theme of the different corporation cards will help determine your game strategy ... go for planting forests or microbe research or nuclear bombs.

Edit: Played 2 player without the Corporate Era project cards which, while making the game a little less complex, sped up the game quite a bit. The draft still worked, but it gets less important as you have less players. My brother in law won by beating me to the Milestones.

Only complaint is that some of the cards are not cut equally around the edges, nothing a lot of card sleeves won't fix.

Another card-combo game with asymmetric player powers. It reminds me a bit of Imperial Settlers; here, there is a central board with associated competition for actions, rather than limited direct interaction.

The theme is rather nice, although I do question exactly how realistic it is. And as the chrome wears off, I do wonder if most of the cards are simply variations on increase this/decrease that, rather than providing unique benefits. But I would like to play some more.

Heavy downtime but calculating your moves is largely useless because of constant take that. Number of available actions depends on topdecking skill. Mediocre graphic design.

Great game. Played for the first time at WBC this year (2017) and loved it. We played a game of it every night afterwards until the con was over. There were many other games that got a lot of great reviews that I have yet to play but, for me, this was the game of the year which is surprising because I'm mainly a wargamer.

I like this game a lot -- especially the build-up at the start of the game.  However, I feel like the luck of the cards is a drawback.  Too much luck in one player's favor can throw things a bit.  The drafting variants help with this immensely.

After a few more plays, I find that I am really enjoying this game even more.  In early games I overlooked the value of building up the board as a complement to the card plays -- there are a lot of strategic and tactical choices in this game that appeal to me, from the early build-up to the endgame race for points and board influence.  I do wish it was about 45 minutes shorter, but I think with more plays, my group will play faster.

Excitingly thematic with lovely 'corporation' abilities and a fresh and original feel, which is no mean achievement. But it's also economically drab: too easy to dragged into rote moves here, and especially frustrating as the game drags into its third hour when you have an obvious route to the finish but lots of dead-time. The lack of any turn-order flexibility means you'll too often be victim to other players' decisions. Lucking into big combos also plays a part, and a draft is not the way to fix this.

I'm sure it's a swell game for some, but for me: too long, too card-tableau based (like Race for the Galaxy),  and too space-themed. I don't really see any new mechanics here to get excited about anyway. One frustration was endlessly digging through random cards to try to find ANYthing that would work with other cards. "Add a microbe to another card" is useless on its own, for example. Do not want.

RATING: N/A
Only played once - took, way, way, way too long - literally hours - contributing to the game length was that we were playing with the non-beginner rules that assume you already know what you're doing.  Extra cards and the drafting took up tons of extra time.  These rules seem necessary to add depth, otherwise it isn't much of a game, but they add length even if you know what you are doing!  As a new player it was a lot to process - how do these cards work, should I keep them, should I deny them to my opponent, etc.  Now, I love that kind of thing, but I was shocked how long it took - now where near the advertised length of 90-120 mins!

I hope the time to play this comes down by leaps and bounds, or this one wont be one I can play very often.   I don't really need another long game in my collection collecting dust, that never gets played.  And that would be too bad because I really like it.

Possibly the solitaire play is actually good?  Then I can probably whip through it faster and get more use out of it.

The only other complaint was the stupid little cubes.  My particular strategy used tons of cards that added cubes to them and it got very, very messy.  One bump and my score was obliterated ... my opponent didn't have that issue, as he had very few cards collecting cubes.  Fiddly, fiddly mess and cross-referencing cards that got triggered by other cards was time consuming.  Like I said though, my opponent didn't have that ultra-combo cube issue with his strategy.

Otherwise, a completely awesome game experience!

Its a good game, even very good... but I don't get that overhype it gets. Felt a bit similar to Race for the Galaxy as its basicly cardgame where cards get dealt from one pile and you just have to somehow figure out how to best play these to further your own goals. Might be I need more plays to start appriciating it more. Don't get me wrong, its a good game still

Very good and thematic game. The Components could be a little more sturdy, but otherwise brilliant. The thematic science is close enough, the card texts are flavorful, the pictures are evocative, the board is inspiring. Mechanics seem to be working well, our first games came in very close, with several strategies working roughly evenly well.

You get a good feel for building your little engine in the first part of the game. Some small take-that elements but not so many that it would spoil the fun for anyone on the receiving end. Then the game ramps up hard for the second part of the game. Anyone who have played will know what i'm talking about. Rush to the finish.

All in all. I recommend this game.

Still don't know, how I feel about this game. Theme is super interesting (at least for me) and very well integrated, with a clever game ending goals that practically set the game lenght around 2-2,5 hours for every player count (so it scales well). You can even have some nice plays, that will make other people go: "cool move!" and I think that replayability is really high. Especially the ending is very tense and interesting, as everyone tries to squeeze som last victory points, and got us even standing on our toes one time. On the other hand, engine building is somehow loose, You can upgrade few things here and few there, but rarely are they connected as I would expect and I never felt (but I just could be a bad player, this may or may not improve with several more plays) that I created a well oiled specialized machine. Then there is very low interaction, which should possibly be solvable with draft variant, but I must try it first to form an opinion, altough I suspect that this will prolong the game. There is also so much information on the cards, which makes the game really AP prone, but if You play with people without the need to calcute every step it is not so bad. Other minus is that there is a potential problem with a runaway leader (VPs=income, leading to more VPs) without a catch-up mechanism. And the last thing. The art. First, it all feels a little lazy as many components (main board included) look like they are 1-2 steps from being finished (and possibly good looking), but the artist did not put in the effort (balancing colors, doing some final polishing). Also, it lacks consistency. Some cards have painted images, some photographs (badly done, I must add) some are quite nice, even beautiful, others really horrible. The design of the cards also isn't clean and there is a lot of unnecessary stuff there (more in this case is much less) as if it was created to distract You from some of the ugly images. I know, that it was supposed to mimic the look and "feel" of a journal publishing popular science articles but still... And the ugliest have to be the player mats, which look like they were done as a last minute high school project in MS Paint in 1997. But overall I still like this game and even enjoyed it more everytime I play it, which is probably due to its well done theme, as the game design certainly has its flaws.Edit: 5 player experience is very boring and the already low interaction resulted in total lack of interest for other peoples moves. I would play the game in 2-3, possibly 4, but never 5.

El año pasado había largado con el Terraforming Mars y me había dejado la impresión de un juego extraordinario. De movida me iba a caer bien, porque soy un fan de la exploración espacial y la ciencia ficción "realista", y para el diseño del Hábitat Espacial pude estudiar muchas de las teorías detrás de cada cartas que aparecen en el Terraforming Mars.

Tenía tantas opciones para explorar y una engine de cartas con tanto espacio para el pro-play que me reservé comentarlo porque sentía que tenía que conocerlo más.

Un año después, ya con varias partidas encima, en el Ficus y en solitario, creo que es el momento de revisar si el juego está a la altura de las primeras impresiones. Cha cha cha chaaaaaaaannnn *suspenso*

Una de las dudas que me surgió fue la capacidad de especialización. Si bien terraformar un planeta es un proceso complejo que tiene muchas aristas, no me atraía la idea de que todos termináramos "haciendo lo mismo en distinto orden", como pasa en muchos euros. En este juego esperaba un costado más temático, que hiciera brillar las capacidades asimétricas de las distintas corporaciones.

En este sentido, el juego cambia completamente de acuerdo al número de jugadores, porque el objetivo final de terraformar el planeta no escala para nada, y creo que por ahí es un elemento de diseño que le faltó, pero es opinable.

El resultado es que cuando son pocos jugadores, cada jugador tiene más turnos, y baja más cartas, y termina haciendo más cosas, y al final, se diluye un poco "la" especialización en diversas especializaciones. Por supuesto, con menos jugadores las engines son enormes y tremendamente potentes, algo que sin duda resulta atractivo.

Por otro lado, cuando son más jugadores, la especialización tiene más personalidad, porque en menos turnos no se puede ser tan abarcativo, y temáticamente creo que le suma.

De todos modos, un elemento fundamental para lograr esa especialización es contar con cierto control sobre las cartas que te llegan, y la mecánica básica del juego en ese sentido tiene una alta dosis de azar. Creo que para lograr el efecto temático de especialización hay que encararlo con más jugadores y con la variante del drafteo de cartas, para tener más control.

Si por el contrario, buscás un euro power-builder con increíble profundidad, encararlo con menos jugadores es suficiente y el drafteo menos necesario.

De cualquier modo, Terraforming Mars sigue siendo un título que recibe mi mayor recomendación y hasta donde mi experiencia lo indica, es sin duda el mejor juego complejo lanzado en 2016.

What I love - Combination of all the game aspects. Cards between themselves, cards with board, board with main factors, main factors with cards and so on. Scientific theme is really well designed here and you can feal what you're doing has sense.

What I hate - 50:50 with real pictures and painted ones, hideous graphical design and really evil player boards. You must avoid hitting these at all cost otherwise you will lose track of your production for ever.

Summary - Perfect game design which suffer from graphical design. Despite that Terraforming Mars is in my current top ten games I want always play.

Good game. The card systems works well if you find the right combinations. The different starting resources/abilities make it interesting to focus on what you're good at. Not much interaction going on and kind of weird that you can play the game almost independently with either focusing on the cards rather than the board. I like it though.

Downgraded from 8 to 7.5. There is quite some luck involved in the card draws (too much). And the interaction is really low. You cannot really follow what others are doing.

There are so many things I like in this game. The only thing that will stop it rising in the ratings is that the game goes half an hour longer than it feels it should – next time I play I’m going to try the designer’s variant where each turn the new start player increases one of the three game-ending conditions a bit. Regardless, I like how the corporation cards drive you to try different approaches from the get-go, I like that you have to make hard decisions on cards right from the start (and each turn ongoing), because they cost you to acquire them AND to play them. Essentially that's the game, ie what you pick and play. There are lots of currencies for card effects to mess around with, and lots of approaches to earning VP's. I like the milestone and award races, and how you need to fund them to get them operational and only the first 3 (and ergo the most desired for this game) of each will make it into play. This, and the fact that you'll see a different card mix each game, has the potential to drive a ton of replay.

Played three times, liked but not too much, positive aspects the simplicity, the setting and the huge quantity of possible combos added to the diversification of possible strategies.

Negative aspects represented mainly by the downtime due to the need to check continuously the possible combos, the difficult to follow what are doing other players and it seems to me that pointing towards "bio" (plants, animal,...) seems too much strong versus different strategies.

In spite of the issues with this game: 4 hr play time (two players starting with 1 production on all tracks which is the faster version), the cubes getting knocked around (happened twice in spite of being extremely careful), chipping cubes, easily flaking cards (immediately sleeved), destroyed insert, we enjoyed it, mainly as turns go by very fast so you are never sitting around waiting.  There is no way we would ever draft in this game as it would just add another half hour.  We found there was enough variety in the card choices each round.   I got rid of Great Western Trail because the games seemed interminably long at three hours. I don't have a problem with play time in terraforming mars as it is more involving and fun. Also didn't care about the perceived issues with artwork. Barely noticed it most of the time as we were busy reading cards.

Update: sat on shelf for a year and that’s because I now dread the 3-4 hour playtime, and it hasn’t really inspired me to set it up. Also doesn’t work well with 2 and that is all I play these days. Would rather play Star Wars rebellion if I need a four hour game. Rating down to 5.

An excellently executed game system which provides a variety of routes to victory and a tension lacking in many other games. Incredibly ambitious in what it seeks to achieve, and is successful in its application. In spite of the frankly tragic graphic design/'illustration', the game is visually intuitive(ish) and surprisingly feels somewhat thematically immersive.

With greater care in design of the thematic fluff, and a redo of the visuals, I could see this being one of the greatest games of the modern era.

I've enjoyed this game on a couple of occasions, but don't feel it is something I am rushing to play again.  I like the idea of the 'solo drafting' but this can be bad if someone gets a powerful combo as happened in one of our games, an other play had a player with easy access to animals that became available early and could rack up end game points.  With 5 I felt that it was slow starting and then ended too quickly.  With 4 there was more time to grab the achievement awards, which ultimately determined the winner.  Both games ended before forests really took their mark, which would have rewarded the players who were building cities and not just grabbing points.  Both games I missed out on mission cards with point values and saw my efforts eroded by the luck of the draw.  Happy to play, but probably would not be my choice.

RATING: 7
Fun, but the game can really depend on getting a good card draw.  You should mostly be aiming for specific things for points and you can really get hammered if the cards you draw go differently.  Trying to do everything usually means someone else wins.  That and this game can take seem like it takes forever if you have slow people since everything is choosing which cards to keep, then which card to play on their turn.  For my group that is about 3 hours for 4 players.

Finally Fryxgames produces a really excellent game, and of course it's Jacob's creation, the best designer in the family. 

I like games with a lot to do where the skill is to optimize and maximize to be able to do more and more rather than games with a limited number of actions, so this game suits me well. 

The engine that drives the game to an end, terraforming, is cooperation and at the same time as you actually compete for those terraforming points. I know some players that have problems with games where you can decide to end the game or not regardless of how you are doing and that wont "allow" you to end the game if you're not in the lead (Worst of all are the french online "Gang of Four" players). But in this game you're not entirely sure if you are in the lead or not, there are a lot of hidden points. That in it self might also be a problem for some players, but not me. 

One of this games strengths is that there are several very different strategies to win. Some companies might be stronger than others, but what differs more is how you play them. 

I have been of the opinion that draft is necessary to make this game fun, but I have realized that randomly dealing cards has its merits too. The Standard Projects come more in play when you get less cards that suit you. 

When I play with my gaming group we always use drafting though. We also draft the ten first cards. This is how we start: Deal 2 or three companies each to chose from. Deal five cards, draft those clockwize. Decide which company you wanna play and display it. Deal five cards and draft counterclockwize. 

I got to try the fast start with the prototype for Alliances at a convention this spring, which was really good. Everyone got going faster, which is more fun for everyone.

Love it, both the solo and multiplayer variants. After multiplayer sessions we usually have "wow what a great game" after-talk.

Initially I had it at rated at 9 but after having introduced it to my kids (age 8 & 10, Swedish kids - not proficient in English) and getting their reaction on it I bump it to 10. I mean after having played a fairly thought-intense 3 hour session with a 10 year old that then immediately goes "Again?" is really rewarding.

Not that it is a kid's game, but it is accessible through consistent design elements, not actually requiring reading skills or mastering English once you've got the hang of its symbols.

A prime example of the "complex but not complicated" paradigm.

2 plays - This is definitely an elegant game. Very, very smooth and streamlined. The visuals are horrific, but the game play itself is fun, rewarding and different each time. The VP scoring from player chosen objectives is interesting and helps replayability. A main concern is balancing of the card draws, particularly in the timing in which you receive them - though I suspect this issue only really arises after a few plays and familiarity with strategies. Unfortunately, I can't speak to this with limited plays, but in the games I played the game never outstayed its welcome and I felt like I went on very 'enjoyable' ride.  I was very pleased when I got to nuke mars : ) That artwork though...

I enjoy the mechanics as you draw cards and upgrade your production to create an engine while also playing on mars to develop it. However the cards are extremely varied and may be frustrating quite often as you may not get the cards that match your strategy once you get it going. You also need to ensure you focus on the end game of getting points as with an engine game you can get lost in the engine, but my main issue is that you just need to do the best with what you have so it is fairly random. You cannot aim for specific cards as there are so many and no order in the draw deck. Each time I play I like it less.

Wasn't bad. I liked that we had cards on the board and how some of the asteroids affected other players so that we could kind of attack each other. The resources were quite fiddly, though, and I wasn't a big fan of how most of the pieces could only be played on pre-designated spots.

There's a lot of things to do. The rules are not that complicated, but the sheer number of cards and possibilities, appears to be very promising sign of this game being very replayable. I'd say it takes longer to complete than 90 min.

Solid tableau and civ builder. The amount of cards that are all different are testament to an excellent design. 2/11/17
Played again today and I am not as sold on it. Down from a 9 to an 8. I think there needs to be a mid-game draft of 5 additional cards per player to mill the deck a bit more to allow players to find certain cards. 25/3/17
After the second game I am not really feeling it. Down to a 7.

Terraforming Mars is a card-based engine-building game based on achieving three goals--increasing the planet's temperature, increasing the oxygen level, and placing ocean tiles on Mars. The game has six different resources, and for each of these, you have a bank and an income track. Some of these resources can be traded in directly to impact the three goals, while others just help you pay the costs of cards. The real heart of the game is card play though--the game has hundreds of cards, all different, and each of these manipulates your resources or the planet in various ways. In the end, players add up how much they've contributed to the three goals, along with points from tiles they've placed on the Mars board, points from cards, and various other bonuses to determine a winner. While I'm usually pretty theme-agnostic, I have to admit that this one kind of takes me in. The card play is very engaging, as it's just fun to set up your combos. There is are some take-that elements I didn't enjoy, but those are a minor part of the game. On the whole, this one was a winner.

Don't buy this. Engine building. Too mathematical? Dry (quoting SU&SD). Little player interaction? Bad with two. Too slow with five players. Race for the Galaxy is better as an engine builder.

Has a good solo mode though? Probably too complex for me.

I'm undecided on how much I enjoyed it. I keep thinking about it, so that's a good sign, but I wonder if the shine will wear off. This has potential to raise a point or drop a point with future plays. 5 seemed a little long, but it was more the downtime than the actual play time. I thought the card play was pretty cool though and reminded me like a sci-fi version of Seasons.

I do think the components are a huge letdown. Shiny cubes are cool, although they don't make a whole lot of sense theme-wise. Keeping track of resources with them was a little bit of a pain. I do think the player boards could have been made to have holes punched in them to have cubes stored in there including a +10, +20 etc spot. I can't comment on the quality of the box.

Overall, the game was solid and I'm interested in playing it again. Preferably with 3-4 players.

Update: Alright, played it with 2 players and while it plays just fine, I found it lacking somewhat. It felt a bit more solitaire and obviously it's tit for tat. I'd like to try the standard game as we've played extended twice and both times it felt a bit too long for what the game actually is. Plus you end up pulling out like 1/3 of the cards which I think might make it a more strategic game. I also liked the drafting variant, but it might just add a bit too much time to an already longish card game.

I think it overstays it's welcome by ~30-45 minutes. If this was an hour game, it'd be great, but it tends to push 90-120 minutes without too much trouble. Playing time doesn't really decrease much with lower player counts.

Update 2: Alright, played it solo and it seems to have firmly cemented my opinion of the game now. I like a lot of what it does, but it very much reminds me of Prosperity with the constant fluctuation of resources. I liked the solo game well enough and I do think it seems to play good with solo and probably 3-4 players. 2 and 5 seem to be the odd man out on this one. I'd play it again if asked, but I'm not jonesing like I once was to get it to the table.

I also find most of the cards to be rather bland. The blue ones are the interesting ones and most are really retroactive or just "place an ocean down". Nothing exciting.

RATING: 9
--- This is a quite nice production-type game.  Each player can do his own thing (plans & plan execution) with minimal fellow player, Act-Of-God disasters inflicted upon the player.
--- As an important notice however, TFM has a characteristic, which some people may find off putting.  If via the random, "Act-Of-God" cards, a player jumps off to a first or second turn, important production lead over the other players, & if that favored player subsequently plays competently, it is almost impossible for the other players to catch the player receiving the early production lead.
----- In my informed opinion, so be it.  In the next game in the early turns, the Act-Of-God cards will probably favor another player.  Otherwise, the players can play their game & try to outwit the other players.
--- This is a good game.  It is enjoyable.  :)

RATING: 6
In my opinion this game is overhyped.

I would say this is a typical game for a collector who just needs new games in his/her shelf, to keep her/his hobby alive.

All the mechanics are far from giving a fresh gameplay feeling.
And for the price, what do you get?
Realy realy realy bad bad bad ugly graphics! 
Why people overlook this aspect 
when they vote this product an 8?
To many Icons are missing on the board to remind you of rewards you get.
So much energy gets lost just for the upkeeping elements, and to take care not to forget something.
The explanation texts on the cards are discriminating small.
Elegance is missing here everywhere.
Then the player "tableaus"!!!!!!
Flimsy cardboard, where your markers slide around. 
I can´t find other words for it: this is shit!
Again, how can people ignore this when say give this game a high rating. You encourage designers/producers to deliver bad quality components.
And the game is expensive! It cost 60 Euro!!!! For what?
The only interesting part in the game is the interconnection of the card effects. 
For half the price
way more exciting art
more elegance in game mechanics
more tense interesting shorter playtime
and good card quality
you get all this in "Race for the galaxy". It´s from 2007!!!!
Better overcome the higher learning/mastering curve for "Race for the Galaxy", rather than spending way to much money on this underdeveloped product.

I enjoyed all of the different cards to grow your resources and terraform Mars by tile placement.  There was some interaction with others and I also liked the mechanisms for the milestones and awards.  Fairly deep and solid game.

My main nits was that I wish there were more mechanisms for card draws.  It was hard to combo when specific cards were not available.  Also difficult to track whose turn it was constantly.  Game seemed to take too long with five players.

Terraforming Mars is great to play in small groups and apparently solo as well! I just finished my first single-player playthrough and it was a blast. The game has amazing replayability due to it having a large variety of cards and many strategies for acquiring the victory points required to win the game. Solo is almost a different experience as you need to find a balance to make sure you meet all three global parameters by the end of the game.

RATING: 5
You get some cards, and you choose the best ones, and when it's your turn you play those.  Repeat for two to three hours.  Then everyone counts up their points and somebody says: "yeah I got twenty points from this three-card combo" and you lose.

This is a spiritual successor to Race For The Galaxy which I like quite a bit, but it's much slower paced.

If your gripe with Race For The Galaxy is that you want it to take four times as long and you'd rather take turns rather than have everyone play in parallel: I'll bet you'd like this game!

(In fairness the placing-tiles-on-Mars mechanics are pretty neat.  If they made a whole game around that mechanic I might play it.)

I find this game really enjoyable, but out of the two plays I've done they have been at 4.5 hours with five players and 3 hours with two players. I'm hoping to discover something I am missing.

My appreciation for this game started slowly. My group didn't like it at first and I think it hindered my first impression. What I have come to realize is that the amount of possibilities and strategies is so big that it can get overwhelming to see the potential in each card. There is definitely a balance to find between pinpointing a strategy and staying open, which I really like since it reminds me my draft experiences in Magic: The Gathering. I still don't like any of the components, but I've come to like the game, regardless of them.

For an engine builder it's pretty good. But I'd like it more if the attack/defence was less swingy and less 'take that'.

I think the attacking is poorly implemented, mainly due to the lack of viable defence, except for the completely op protected habitats card (your tree/microbe/plants never get stolen).

Very happy with this game. It's a thoroughly enjoyable engine builder that seems to have high replayability. I'm a little worried as I've seen some players get off to a bad start and have a near impossible time playing catch-up, which can turn off first-time player. I like the theme, and honestly think I'm only now cracking into the levels of nuance this game provides. It's easy enough to teach to new comers, though it may take a full game cycle for new players to really get a handle on it, but that's not really unusual.

The Rulebook is a bit of a mess, but you can manage it. The only issue I have with the components is the player boards, as you really do need an overlay - otherwise you have to worry about bumping the table just a smidge and you are all messed up. 

That aside this is a sold engine building game, the theme comes through surprisingly well. I have played mostly as a solitare game and it is very good at that. The multiplayer game has some mean aspects to it that I am not sure I love, but time will tell.

Rating based on a prototype I 'got' from Intrafin. Still needs some polishing as some questions came across while playing. 

It's a game where you have to look for combo's between cards, something I like very much. And you can really look for those combo's as you draft 4 cards at the beginning of a round and you chose which 1 you will keep (by paying 3 MC for it).

The points to work - from my point of view - are the playing time (+ 2 hours with 3 experienced players felt for all off us as a bit too long) and downtime can be high as it is a sort of multiplayer solitaire.

Edit 23/04/2017: Played the final version of this game for the first. It was a very frustrating experience, because of your starting hand contains almost only cards with high prerequisites,  you will have a bad start and a hard time catching up. But the issues that we encountered in the prototype are imho resolved.

An inoffensive game, but not groundbreaking or especially interesting. 

The main issues: (1) effectively multiplayer solitaire, (2) the card pool is way to big -- this is an issue because it means what you get is highly random, so there aren't really interesting decisions vis-a-vis the engine building. This is lessened if you play with the drafting rules, but but that only addresses the issue somewhat. It would be much better if there were 25% fewer cards, so that the deck cycles 2+ times. (3) Some games can plainly better than others, some are highly situational. It's a total crap shoot (luck of the draw). 

Not bad, but certainly not great nor amazing. If I was being charitable, I'd give it a 7

Also, this is not a heavy game at all. It's a light euro (ie. lighter than mid-weight)

All of the rage going into this month of October. It was definitely the hit of game day on Oct 1, 2016. Neat mechanics. Can be a bit luck dependent but there is some drafting for cards which helps a bit. VERY cool bits! I have to say there are some nice things going on and it will reward with more plays. Ron was super excited before we even started and said we have to own this game. It is now on the wishlist. :) If it was up to me I might not really need to own it since I know it will be on many of my gaming friend's shelves. It will work with most of my groups, I know that. Solid game and recommended at least for trying once. I will add the art is a weird mix of photography and illustrations which I don't understand and actually don't really like.

This game just boils down to who draws the best combination of cards. There's lots of activity, but it just veils the fact that you're not making any strategic decisions. No decisions specifically forward your gameplay, your board position, or opponent's success. You're not even playing the odds of drawing a synergistic card. All you're doing is hoping you draw cards that will make you more money than your opponents. Really disappointed by about the 3rd playthrough.

Otherwise, the art is inconsistent and sometimes terrible, the scale of card costs is too large without good reason, and the static map basically doesn't affect the outcome or add variance. Just a really mediocre board game.

Card drafting, hand and resource/currency management, engine/tableau builder. Compelling, engaging theme enhanced by mechanics, plus flavor text. Variable player powers. Med-low player interaction, Med high-complexity (will take a few plays to grasp everything). Solo variant available.

-Marred by several mean take-that card actions (albiet anti-hoarding measures). AP prone, a bit fiddly with the player boards and multiple resources. Component quality a notch below average for the price. Satisfying progression but it can play quite long with lower player counts (victory conditions don't scale)

In this game, players get a hand of unique cards, and then on their turn they chose to take 1 or 2 actions, which could be playing a card, using an ongoing effect card, or paying some number of accumulated resources to bump a marker up one of the charts that represent the planet getting a little better. Each time you improve the planet, you get a personal point. The game has a lot of luck in terms of which cards you wind up getting, and a lot of downtime between turns as players ponder which of their many many cards to activate. There are take that cards, but they don't seem to be very strategic, as their effects are minor, and maybe cost your opponent up to 1 vp. The player interaction is low, which isn't something that discounts a game for me, but the games that are like that, that I do like, all have some special shining mechanism that makes them stand out, but there isn't anything like that here.

Wow.  I have not had such a good time in a long time.  We played with 3 players,  each of us experienced gamers.  First time playing through so went a bit long at about 5 hours, but really had a wonderful time the entire time.  Short-turns (though a little AP near end game), felt really engaged.  The engine building mechanic was very balance and the cards were super interesting.  I can see that there is just so much replayability as there are so many options available in the form of Corporation cards and other action cards.  My one major complaint was the quality of some of the components.  The player mat could have been of much better quality, I.e. Clash of Culture like.

Leider erfordert das zufällige Kartenziehen selbst beim Draften Glück; bei großem Pech ist das Spiel gelaufen, ohne dass man etwas tun kann- für mich ein Faktor, der für viel Frust sorgt und ein Spiel kaputtmachen kann. Aber sind wir mal ehrlich: die Karten sehen spitze aus, die Regeln sind kompakt und bieten trotzdem Spielraum für viele unterschiedliche Taktiken. Besonders schön: im unteren Teil der Karten ist der Effekt mit physikalischem Bezug erklärt. Nicht nur dadurch wird die thematische Umsetzung schlichtweg zu einer der stärksten auf dem Markt- und sowas lässt mich auch über die kleinen Schwächen hinwegsehen und sagen "Wow- grandioses Spiel!"

Race for victory points by producing resources and spending them on cards and planetary features. Card draws are random and can be a bit swingy, but there is almost always something useful amongst them. Not much player interaction but that would hurt the wonderful theme.

RATING: 6
An interesting engine-builder that feels a bit scattered.
I like the metallic cubes and the way they are used for every resource. I like the tradeoffs between getting resources now or increasing resource production for the future.
I don't like how much the luck of the draw affects your options. Every card in the very large deck is unique, and many of them are much more or less useful depending on your exact circumstances. Many cards seem almost useless unless you know which other cards work with them, which can be frustrating if you haven't played recently enough to be familiar with all the cards.

Lucky enough to be a playtester for Terraforming Mars and absolutely love the game!
With over 200 cards and each one unique, every game is different.  When you draft your Corporation, you can start off with an idea of one strategy but the way the cards fall and what your opponents do can (and usually does) completely change that.
Played with 2, 3 and 4 players many times and it plays differently with each number of players.
So much depth to the game, I highly recommend it!

[ESP] Es un juego que parece muy complicado pero después de las primeras rondas se entiende muy bien la mecánica, lo interesante está en la cantidad de cartas que se tienen y que permite tener diferentes formas de puntuar, esto añadido a que cada jugador inicia con una corporación diferente con habilidades especiales cada una. Es un muy buen juego en el que el setup es muy rápido en el que prácticamente es sólo barajear las cartas. Como detalle importantes es que los parámetros para terminar el juego no cambian por el número de jugadores y contrario a muchos juegos es más tardado a menos jugadores.

RATING: 9
Based into physical reality (well, mostly - it's an SF theme) the game evolves around terraforming Mars. This is accomplished by executing projects or facilitating events (or, as game mechanism: playing cards or choosing standard places). Since each project not only costs money, but effects your resources in a complex way, all projects are more or less depending/building on other projects. In the game you play one corporate which has its own set of conditions/rules to follow. This is the solo part of the game

Since there is only one Mars changing of global parameters (temperature, oxygen level, cultivation) will effect all players. So there is a strong interactive component, e.g. building a city on the "right" spot just before your opponent manage or rising the temperature to get a bonus.

You follow a strategy (based on the corporation you represent), think tactics to outsmart your opponents and, optimize everything to get the most victory points (most of them through the terraforming value, which represents your contribution to the terraforming of Mars).

I see only one negative point: the rules are explained in condensed text rather than pictures and repetitions. This leads to some paging through the nice booklet until you get everything right. But once you got it, the game is fantastic.

This is one of the best games I have ever played.  There are tons of good decisions.  The game plays differently every time depending on the cards that you get,  I really like playing with the card drafting option to better control the cards you have access to.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Let me start out by saying this rating is after playing once with three players. I suspect this rating would be quite a bit higher for the solo game. 

The reason for that is because for the most part in this game I was not focused on what my opponents were doing or considering what they did. And even if I had been paying attention to whatever they were up to, I'm not quite sure how what actions they take really impact what I'm about to do. 

For the most part the game is about managing your economy and hand of cards, and there is relatively little you can do to influence anyone else. I didn't draft, and I can see how that would add a little bit to the game, but still with so few cards you're drafting each time and still needing to set up your own economy, I'm not sure how that's supposed to magically fix the issues I had. 

Every card does something different and they are all pretty cool. But the issue is that most of the game is spent intently considering how all your own cards will work together and what I can be doing to maximize my stuff--I didn't really have time to consider what all my opponents had or what they were doing. And frankly I don't think it really matters, because even if I did, I'm not sure how that would have really influenced what I would be doing. Your cards and starting corporation pretty much dictate what you advantages you need to leverage and what path you are going down, so I'm not sure what sort of reacting to other's actions there is supposed to be, and if I'm not doing that, then how are we really interacting or even playing a game together? 

With all that being said it is rather fun to build up these crazy engines and see everything paying off while terraforming the planet. I will play this again and enjoy my time maximizing what I'm doing. I just would rather play many games that see me actually interacting with my opponents that allow me to plan my strategy out a bit more rather than largely having the game play me and lead me where it says I should go (based on corporation and cards I draw).

Solid euro-solitaire, that combines multiple resource management with card playing and Suburbia-like tile laying. Abysmal graphic design and artwork is the reason why I will never play it again in its current state. Absolute rubbish in this regard. 

It's a smart combination (cards/resources/building common boardstate), the end game condition vs fixed rounds is a step in the right direction, but all in all it feels like this design didn't reach its intended peak, as such it feels not polished and a bit meh. Tile placement is largely superfluous. The take-that interaction seems tacked on and totally random and unnecessary (I love games with interaction, but it needs to be meaningful). There is a lot of cards in this game, which means that the draw deck is very diluted and the game will play you for most of the time - there are no big decisions here, you just decide what to do with more or less shitty draw. There aren't many ways to get more cards, so you are the slave of the variance. Also, I didn't like the fact that it snowballs towards end of the game - your income is 20 at the beginning, and ~70 in last rounds. 

The game itself isn't that different from Imperial Settlers and IS play in 1/3 of TM time.

I was fascinated by this title because each card of the deck that drives the game is different and the relatively straightforward mechanics of the game ... draw cards, then play cards.

However, several issues:
* For such a mechanically simple game, the first half of the game is soooo slow.
* In my only game, I unluckily couldn't get any cheap cards that would increase my income. Thus I had to pass way more often than other players. I don't mind being behind for the entire game (especially considering how multiplayer solitaire-ish this game is). I do mind doing much less than my other opponents, especially considering this is a 3h game.

I would consider trying this again with only two players (5 is too much) and to start with a beginner corporation!

One of the best engine building games I've played with a wonderfully integrated theme. I now believe the hype. 
It's not perfect. The sheer variety of cards is both a benefit and a impediment, though.  It creates a steep learning curve and the randomness of the draw, while adding infinite variety, can also lock you out of certain resources available to others. 
It also can be difficult to follow other players' engines, and sometimes it doesn't seem to matter, giving that multi-player solitaire feel; however, the main things you need to know are on the production boards mainly. Still, you can get surprised by cards triggering that you didn't really know that they had.

I enjoyed this as a card drafting game, but can't imagine even remotely liking it in any other format.
Crunchy enough to require some serious calculation and tactical play, but the fact that cards can severely limit the scope of what you can do with your turn gives you focus and generally prevents too much AP.
That said, this game is still LOOOOOOONG, especially when playing it as a draft.  Our last session ran 5 hours, and we had all played before.  Also, as much as I did like the flow of play, ultimately who wins and who looses comes down to who drew cards that work well with each other and who didn't.
A game that requires this much time, brain power and strategic focus just ends up feeling disrespectful to its players when so much of your engine is up to the hand of fate.   
I won my last game by a landslide, but in no way felt I deserved it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
After a few plays, replayability seems to be high with variety of cards and many different start corporations. Still enjoy waiting to play it again to see which engines I build. Every game gave me different engines and combos, but sometimes the right cards simply didn’t come out. Can be tactically mitigated fine wth other actions, playing cards or passing to the next generation.

Scores were also very close so runaway leader may not be a problem here unless everyone decides to use red take that cards on one person. Red cards can affect other players slightly like taking resources or slowing down production slightly. Making sure you get at least one award or milestone and placing ocean and greenery tiles out can make the different in close games.

Very enjoyable because it’s thematic and you feel like you're playing together to support humanity while competing with others to terraform Mars the best. Plays well with two, but best with 3-4. 5 players will have more downtime, but will be the most competitive if you don’t mind it. Game time is 60-90m for solo and closer to 120m for 2-5 players while Corporate Era adds about 20-30m to the game.

Only other complaints I have is that the end game could drag if everyone focuses on their engine building instead of terraforming the last of Mars’ requirements (usually not a problem though since terraforming gives you VP’s). The components are fine, but the player boards could have slots to place cubes in to prevent them from sliding if accidentally bumped. Again, just a minor complaint since I doesn’t really happen.

Played only once.  Would like to play again with fewer players.  Enjoyed but too long.

I have the sense that the designer confused his list of ingredients with a recipe for a game, the result of which is a flavorful but undercooked meal.  I agree with the statement in these comments that the designer seems to not have cared about the design, and would add that the subsystems seem incomplete, and often tacked on.  Particularly the tertiary green resources and the 3 redundant currencies that I assume are in play to keep monetary inflation under wraps.  

It may be that enjoyment of the card play and drafting angles will increase with time, and that may make it easier to overlook the sloppy design.  

It's also fucking ugly.  Especially the cubes.  But especially the icons.  And most of all the player boards.

Haven't played yet but have unboxed and can say I was not a fan of the way the game is packaged. There is absolutely no insert and the markers were chipped up, the tiles were loose and two of them torn up, and the game mats were really bent up. I'll contact the company to see if they can make it right.

My first game with three players had this one competing for my favorite game. Since then, I have played this game at all counts from 1-5. I will not play this game with more than three, unless they are willing to play at a brisk pace. Downtime can be too much if people are mulling over their actions. 3 is amazing, 2 is great, and solo is really hard that I give it a shot every once in a while. Overall this game is easily in my top 10 and I have been getting it to the table pretty regularly lately. If you are willing to put in 2 hours for a three player game, after you learn what you are doing, and you want to have to make some real tough decisions, this is the game for you. I like it enough at the time frame to get a game of it in 1-2 times a month usually. **Wife:8.5

Awesome game play.

This game would probably be a 10 if we're just considering the mechanics and theme.  Everything ties together really well and is very streamlined.  Rules can be fiddly, but aren't fiddly due to poor design, just fiddly because there's a lot of good stuff going on.

The good:
Theme and how it is implemented was refreshingly new.
Mechanics are amazing and really tight.  This game keeps you drawn in with your next choices.
Downtime is short unless you have a player who is very new or prone to AP.
The theme fits in with the mechanics very well.
Game has a lot of depth, but it can also be scaled down for newer players.
The game is very fun to replay, without getting stale.

The bad:
I felt like the game was more random than I was expecting.  You can get shafted with a bad first draw of 10 cards which aren't very usable until late game (which is unlikely, but did happen to me).
The components are extremely basic and dull.  Most $60 games have a little more plastic in them.  I've personally ordered some 3D terraforming tiles from Etsy for my game.  The box is way bigger than it needed to be for such basic materials, which kind of gives the wrong impression of how much stuff is contained inside.
I despise games where the deck of cards used is taller than my ability to shuffle all at once, this is one of those games.

Verdict:  Worthwhile purchase, especially if you are a solo gamer.

Different corporations investing in different unique projects to make Mars a habitable planet? Sign me up! The them of this game is off the charts and it's a heavy euro to boot. Very fluid action system, resource management, and good player-to-player interaction. It's one of those games that is easy to learn but has monumental depth accompanying it. Definitely a great complex city-builder game for "veterans"

In my solo-games TM made me crazy because of the poor quality of the material. I was speechless due to the quantity and iconography of the cards though! After all I guess my fingers must be too fat for the little stones that indicate numbers. Too often I touched the thin player board and all the stones were gone. 
With better material quality I absolutely will give TM another chance!!!

El juego es bastante temático, te da la sensación de que eres una compañía terraformando marte,la variedad de cartas es enorme y son todas diferentes por lo que hay mucha rejugabilidad, a 2 jugadores que es como lo ha jugado, el mapa no es apenas determinante en la partida, no te estorbas mucho, mayormente consiste en montarte tu chiringuito generarando mas recursos que el/los contrarios y construir con dichos recursos.

Tardamos 2h 1/2 y se me hizo un pelin largo, no en exceso pero en mi opinión le sobraría media hora de juego para que no se haga pesado ya que en el fondo no haces mas que bajar cartas y mover cubos la mayor parte del tiempo.
En el computo global es recomendable, pero no me parece un juego para echar cohetes, es resulton, sin mas.

Terraforming Mars is an odd game to me. There are a few things I dislike about the game - most prominently is the single target take that aspect. I don't understand the decision to include cards that lets one player punish another player for no other reason than "I had nothing else to play" or "If I didn't take it, you would". It is strange and uncommon to find such mechanic in a euro game (and for good reason). There is no mitigation, no preparation - it just happens. There are some cards with abilities that hinder an opponents strategy (like the Predator) - I don't mind these as much, because once they see play, players can begin to play around these cards.

I didn't like the first two plays too much - however, the game is slowly growing on me. Although the last game ran a little longer than I would have liked - and ended in an unsatisfying way, it was a good experience. I might increase my rating after a few more plays.

This is a really excellent game, though its complexity will be off-putting to casual gamers. There is some luck in the card draw, which can be mitigated via the "drafting" variant--however that adds to the length of the game. I recommend the use of a comprehensive player aid or summary so that newer players can more easily keep track of their options, and the benefits of the actions.

I don’t feel like there’s a mechanic here, so much as a pile of cards which give you VPs (directly or through resource generation that needs ‘combos’ to make into VPs). The most ‘game’ comes from locking down the score potentials before another player. Needs more play?

This is an example of the type of game I'd never play with new players.  I enjoyed the game, for the most part, but it takes too long for new players to understand their options due to the cards being drawn.

I can see this game really shining with a group of players that know the cards/game.  Otherwise, I'm going to avoid it.

Having said that, I can't imagine I'll be playing this game much.  It seems like 90% of the time I'm playing a game we have a least one person who is new to it.

I've played a many times now.  It is highly tactical, which is a plus for me, as I like adapting to changing conditions.  Despite being a Euro, it creates a story.  Player interaction is severely limited, however.  The "multiplayer solitaire" criticism isn't too far off.   Despite that, it is very addictive.

Game of the Year 2016 for me. At first glance it is  nothing unique or innovative, but this card driven engine  builder is just so motivating. You are eager to see what cards you could buy next to improve your engine. You are dependent on the luck of the draw, but this way also every play is different. I actually enjoy the "make the best of your hand" aspect quite a bit. With drafting this luck is reduced and you can better follow your strategy. But still you have to reconsider every turn, if the cards might present a new direction worth following.

Really like this one.  The game takes a while to get through but feels like no time has passed once you are done - always sign of a good game for me.  Component quality could be better especially the cards, I'll be sleeving them ASAP.  Overall very happy with this game and looking forward to the expansion.

Based only on my first 4p -play I have to say this game is ALL THAT.
2nd 4p game seemed a bit draggy, wasn't too happy about cards I had to pick from.
3P game seems like the sweet spot.
Feeling like I get the game after three plays.
Looking forward to more.

I'm not a particularly big fan of low-interaction tableau/resource games, but I found Terraforming Mars more engaging than most games with the format. The sheer variety of cards the robust opportunities for synergy are the core appeal. The map elements also add a nice touch.  Not really my style of game, but I'd certainly play it over other titles in the genre (Terra Mystica, Agricola, La Granja).

Learning game tonight with the wife.  Liked it.
Played 3 times in a week now and enjoying it, lots of variability & replayability.
The engine building integrates well into the theme.
For me game, the length of gameplay isn't an issue, as it give you a good sense of building that engine.
The one design difference i would make, would be to integrate the various cards into generation decks, thereby mitigating some of the luck of the draw.  But then not sure how that would play overall, as part of the fun is hoping a card you picked up early, will be playable later on.

RATING: 7.8
[i]After replaying the game with the advanced deck and card drafting, my rating improved from 6.5 -> 7.8. I advise to use the advanced deck and card drafting mechanisms[/i]

[u]The Positive[/u]
(+) Fun and more or less scientifically grounded theme

(+) Easy game mechanics: the game is quick to explain and easy to understand

(+) The addition of a huge set of optional 'advanced cards' incorporated within the base game makes for great replayability. I advise to use these cards: they allow you to build up a unique economy which adds the required strategic depth necessary to truly enjoy the game

(+) The different company perks you can play with combined with the vast card deck allow for interesting combinations and a game that develops differently each game. I advise to use the card drafting variant in which the 4 cards acquired during the research phase get drafted in stead of just randomly drawn. This adds interactivity and increases the chances to successfully pursue a specific strategy.

(+) Iconography on cards makes a lot of sense: most of the time players do not need to read the explanation written on the cards, which is helpful. Overall the game is cleverly designed.

(+) The game offers players more actions to shape their game compared to similar games which are based on building up an economy, and still the play time remains reasonable with about 30 min per player. Of course the wealth of actions offered in the game is only possible by giving players plenty of 'small' actions, many of which have limited impact, but it still succeeds in giving players the feeling the get a whole lot done in one playsession and it keeps players involved.

[u]The Negative[/u]
(-) Truth be told, this game may lack some character. The mechanics are 'been there done that': there is nothing new or exciting about the game engine (laying out cards in order to build up an economy and getting stuff transformed into points). Honestly, many older games have created game engines revolving around building up an economy in order to build up scoring engines. 

(-) There is a bit of a strange mechanic in which the game starts out extremely slow with players being unable to get any serious stuff done at the beginning. Once the engines start and things are getting interesting the game is over before you know it. This can leave some players who relied on more long term strategies with a bit of an empty feeling at the end.

(-) The game is prone to some downtime due to players trying to put together the right combinations of a whole mess of cards. This can make the game drag a little. Still, despite this disadvantage, I would still advise to always play with the card drafting variant: it does slow the game down a little, but that's a small price to pay for the additional control over the game this offers. Without card drafting, the game loses too much of its strategic appeal.

(-) After playing a few rounds the cards are everywhere on the table and it is useless to try to keep track of special 'blue' actions/abilities of every player. It is also a bit of a chore to keep track of certain milestones (like: 'how many small symbols has this or that opponent acquired?') This makes the game a little messy.

(-) There is quite some luck involved in creating your engine: the right card combinations can be really powerful, but getting those cards together depends on a simple card draw at the beginning of each round. Playing with the card drafting variant seriously helps in this regard, but still a certain luck factor might bite players pursuing a strategy based on really big and expensive cards in the butt: they risk getting no such cards after spending much time and energy in optimizing their engine for those type of cards.

(-) Some negative player interaction cards feel simply stupid and unnecessary. It's no fun when an opponent magically plays a hidden card from his deck destroying your production capacity or well planned for resource stock. Those things don't happen very often - but all the more reason for me not to understand why they were incorporated in the game. Generally speaking I'm not a big fan of negative player interaction in games, so this could just be a very personal thing. Overall, negative player interaction is limited in Terraforming Mars - but at critical times, it does happen. The card drafting variant again improves upon this point: while drafting you can try to hold back negative player interaction cards which would hurt your cause more than opponents.

[u]Tips[/u]
(*) Money is tight in the beginning: if the cards allow for it: start investing in your economy early!
(*) An easy  source of points are milestones. In the first half of the game, keep a very close eye on them and on what your opponents are going for. Awards are similar, but more risky: paying for a certain award too early in the game might open up competition for those points: be careful not to pay to fund an award which gives 5 points to somebody else!
(*) TR rating is more valuable than plain points, as they both increase your score and your income.
(*) The combination of one or two cities and many greenery tiles is a great points generator, but getting many cities out is a costly affair without the right special abilities or construction cards! There are also many points to be had by building good combinations of point scoring cards.
(*) Refrain from buying too many cards: only pay to keep cards which you are able to build immediately or in the very near future.
(*) We played our first game without the advanced card deck. That was a mistake, I expect the game to be more interesting with more strategic possibilities for some economy/engine building when you play with the full deck (incl advanced cards). With only the base cards this game is dull and uninteresting in my opinion. Also, use the card drafting variant for the research phase to allow for more interaction and give players some more control to lay their plans out.

A well-designed game with some very interesting decisions to make, and yet the part that impresses me the most is that just about everything in it is based upon our best scientific understanding of how we might go about actually terraforming Mars.

Update 10/25/2017, One year and 3 more plays later:

Terraforming Mars was one of a handful of games I was introduced to almost a year ago, within the first ten or so "hobby" board games I ever played. Since that time, I revisited it thrice more, interspersed between plays of hundreds of other games of all types. I can say, unequivocally, that my initial feelings have not changed in the slightest. If anything, they've degraded.

-It still plays out over an absurd 3 to 4 hours of multiplayer solitaire.
-The aesthetics are still horrid.
-The resource conversion is still an overwrought, repetitive slog. 
-The random card draws still place the game on rails. In the early game, some cards will be clearly better than others, and in the late game, some cards will be nigh on useless.

...Last but not least, at the end of every game, I still could not care less about what I supposedly achieved on mars. 

Altogether, it is a perfect storm of too long and too repetitive, and this kills the game for me. The mechanisms feel disjointed from the actual theme, and the variety of cards only provides an illusion of depth, and no more. Quantity over quality ad infinitum. I can see there is a dramatically large demographic of players who enjoy this sort of fluff, but I can't find any fun in it. 

***
Original comments:
Terraforming Mars felt surprisingly underwhelming given all the hype. I played with the full complement of players using a drafting variant, and the game just seemed to slog along. The card combinations provided avenues for some neat engine building, but there seemed to be an overarching and nagging disconnect to them all. The non-intuitive card iconography and jarring art variations may have contributed to that disconnect. It was also rather difficult to shake off the feeling of multiplayer solitaire, and that does not sit right with me. In the end, it is just another resource to point conversion game, and I do not care much for the delineated strategy defined by the scoring bonuses.

I found little enjoyment to be had in the game and kept wishing I were playing something else. I will give it the benefit of the doubt and rate it as average, given the positive response by the peanut gallery. It's just not for me.

(+) Given that no two cards are the same you will need to spend some time to learn it all and spot the synergies, allowing for replay-ability.
(+) The mechanism of engine-building is executed well, in its purest form.
(+) You have a means of scoring in a variety of ways.

(-) Seriously lacking in player interaction. There were concerns for take-that mechanisms? They are not abundant, and in the event that they do happen, their impact is lackluster. A diversion. I almost wish there were more.
(-) The art is a mishmash, the icons are non-intuitive, and the components are physically poor in quality. This hurts the already thin thematic connection. 
(-) For a system touting engine building, your freedom to build is seemingly hamstrung by luck. Aside from luck of the draw, the drafting system puts you at the mercy of other players. The player drafting to you can simply assess what you are attempting before willingly keeping a card that would benefit you, despite it being absolutely useless to them. You are constantly attempting to work with what you have, for better or worse, without ability for retaliation.

RATING: 7.5
Overall, this is an enjoyable card driven, engine building game that- unfortunately- goes on so long that it allows  players engines to get quite unwieldy towards the end of the game with too many things to manage. It has plenty of cool combos and interesting card interactions.

The base game is too luck heavy. Too many cards require other cards to combo off of and each card in the deck is unique. With the way that the base game distributes cards (randomly dealt to you), it means that you are not seeing 50%- 75% of the cards in the deck, and you may not ever find the card you need.

The extended game with drafting goes a long way towards solving the issue with the base game, but it becomes much too long and overstays it's welcome. The engine starts becoming unwieldy in the base game, but in an extended game can become overwhelming. 

The solo game is, surprisingly, maybe my favorite way to play this game. Having a hard timer on the game, and fighting to terraform the planet in that much time, puts a sharp focus on the game and really ratchets up the tension. The multiplayer version of this game is a meandering, slow affair, while the single player game is a tight, pressure filled experience. I wish the game included rules for playing a cooperative version of the solo game.

RATING: 3
Player interaction is minimum, for as much of options there are, you rarely need to pay much attention to others because you essentially play by yourself.  The game is extremely slow paced made me want to walk away after 2 hours.  The artwork is inconsistent and lack of direction. I wont play it again, the game is a snoozer.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I'm a little concerned about the terraforming rating = income = victory points. Early advantages can propagate since most of the game is essentially buying victory points. This would be less of a problem if there were more player interaction. 

Maybe after a few more plays I will see what I'm missing on this point.

EDIT: I recently learned that I had been playing a variant of the rules which involved card drafting. It seems that this variant reduces the effectiveness of random card draws to counter balance the terraforming track/income problem.

RATING: 5
as printed: 5/10
with small house rules and a low player count: 7/10 or maybe higher

The directed spite is unfun, unthematic, and out of place in the game.  If you house rule that you must target players as evenly as possible and must target the player with the most of the resource in question, it is less offensive.  But still sometimes randomly hurting people and adding to the playtime.

There is way too much down time, especially if played with 5 (and probably with 4, too).  You can easily be in a position of taking very fast turns running your engine while others are drawing cards that they have to read and replanning their strategy.  You can easily wait 10 minutes for a turn that will take 10 second to perform.

The card draft, especially with the extra cards mixed in, is fun with lots of variety but at the same time very high variance.  You can easily get a high point swing early or late in the game based on a good or bad draw that is really beyond your control.  Drafting the opening 10 cards helps, but the draft on the last turn can still be highly variable.  And you can easily go the entire game and not see a card that supports a particular strategy, or luck into several just when you need them.  This will be better with fewer players, but maybe not good enough.

I REALLY like how the increase terraforming tracks (water, temp, air) mesh with card pre-reqs that make for good drafting decisions.  If there were less luck in the drafting, this would be really cool since it forces you to think about tempo not just cost and effect.  I really liked the spatial board interaction, which were tight but not frustratingly tight.  I also found the engine pleasing to build, intuitive to understand, and satisfying to run.  I just wish I spent more time running it not waiting for others to take turns.

Minor issues:  I liked the photo art and the drawn art, but found them jarring and ugly mixed together in the same game.  I also wish the game had been colorblind friendly -- clear red/green cubes are not, but slightly different choices would have easily and completely solved the issue.

All in all, I'd try it again with 3 player and with house rules.  Then it might shine.  But I am frustrating that there are so many good things wasted in a game with so many bad things going on.

Wow, what an awesome game for solo-players :)

+ great artwork
+ very thematic
+ complexity and strategy
+ always different (companies, cards, KI tiles)
+ the rules are easy to learn
+ the game itself plays so fluently 
+ i like the metal cubes

When I have to say something negative about this game, then its about two things from the material:

- the playerboards are only thick paper ... boards would be cooler
- i dont like real pictures on the cards ... they are mixed, some have painted pictures some are real photos - i prefer more painted graphics

I read about the cubes, that they have all on one edge a small place without the metal colour ... in my opinion you dont reacognize this by playing, so its not negative to me.

This game rocks.

Yes, it's cube pushing, but it's highly evocative cube pushing. It's incredibly satisfying from start to finish. Especially playing with the Corporate Era cards and building from the ground up.

Only thing I'm not a fan of here: production. Card art: cheesy stock photos. Production mats: flimsy pieces of paper (something like Scythe's player mats would be more than welcome here). Board: just... okay. Cubes are cool though. Luckily the design isn't too distracting from the game itself, so I'll give Terraforming Mars a light 9.

Great game, played it as solo and through 2p to 5p. Plays great at all levels. Best as 3 and 4 as 5 can take too long and depending on the players you can lose interest if someone always takes ages on their turn. The solo game is not as good as playing with others in my opinion. The only downside is that it takes an age to play as all games have taken more than 2 hours.

RATING: 8
TfM is the second game I'm encountered (after Viticulture) whose play gives me significantly more enjoyment than I would have predicted just from reading its rules. This makes me think about its design, because I view that as a clear sign that it's doing something very right -- either something which is easily overlooked or else something which is undervalued.

My preliminary thought is that TfM does so well because it directly, steadily hits the 'rewards' part of the brain. Most people respond positively to steady achievement, to spotting beneficial combinations and to creating a visible or tangible achievement. Terraforming Mars makes all of this easy and accessible. Moreover, the game marries these mechanical successes of the player to a real-world theme which also relies directly on these traits. The theme is enhanced by its emphasis on cooperative effort as a prerequisite, meaning that the whole competition is cast in the light of a shared endeavor. I believe that this might make a play session more rewarding, losses slightly less painful, and the subject matter more appealing to a broad audience.

However this also highlights the one consistently jarring note during play: the small segment of take-that cards are almost uniformly ill-received at first. I've seen them almost ruin the first two multiplayer games in which I played, and I am fairly certain that it's exactly because they shatter that thematic synergy with the gameplay to which I've written so far. If that's true then this interests me specifically because it actually points out exactly how much this synergy is contribution to the appeal of the game. More thought is merited here.

At any rate, the game is a very good time, especially with its moderately low rules overhead, and is also  surprising nice for solo play.

Glad I got to try this one before buying.  It's a good game, but is way overhyped.  The game centers around the big deck of cards - the rest of the game (tile placement, competing to be the first to claim goal points, competing for the lead in different scoring categories and paying to decide which end game scoring will count) is all pretty run-of-the-mill Euro.  Players contribute together towards advancing the oxygen/oceans/temperature, but really since these all give you a VP and other benefits (1+ VP for forest tile and touching your city; resources for ocean placement; temperature doesn't give you any other benefit but what else are you going to use heat for), it doesn't feel like you are cooperating to terraform Mars before time runs out or to meet some overarching crisis (some of your cards can't be played until a certain temp/% O2/# oceans, but that's more like a timer you have to wait to go off to play the card than something you're going to really work hard to reach on your own).  The deck of cards are full of great cards, ok cards, and pretty mediocre cards (the cards that let you attack just 1 other player seem like a really bad attempt at making the game more interactive), and there's a lot of randomness what you get dealt (drafting them per the official advanced variant doesn't seem like it would fix it that much, since you will be passing 3, 2, or 1 cards that aren't that great after you've taken the cream, unlike drafting in Agricola where you're trying to draft synergistic cards that will last the whole game or 7 Wonders where you are passing good cards you want to play but can't).  I really don't know why the designer decided you had to pay 3 each to keep cards in your hand that you were dealt.  It's clunky (don't mix them up with your old hand until you've decided which you're buying), it takes a lot of time (how much is it worth it to me to keep this card and spend my precious money I need this turn), and holds up moving forward with the game.  It would have been so much better if he just made all the cards cost 3 more to play them, you get to keep all 4 cards you're dealt (or draft), and then leave it up to players later on in their turns to decide if it's worth it to play a card (you'd have to remove the 16-card-hand goal and maybe a few other minor changes).  I'm happy to play it again and explore the cards I didn't see (note it was difficult to really pay attention to most of the cards my opponents played), but I'm definitely not itching to play it again right away.

Mein Lieblingsspiel. Vor allem wenn man mit Draft-Variante spielt, ist es sehr strategisch.
Es hat aufgrund der unterschiedlichen Konzerne und der verfügbaren Kartenauswahl einen hohen Wiederspielwert.
P.S. Habe mir den Holz-Organizer geholt. Der ist gut, allerdings reicht es aus, bzw. sind die Einkommenwerte sogar besser mit W6-Würfeln für die Mitspieler erkennbar.

A great euro in the traditional fashion, but with significantly more complexity and a rich array of options to choose from.  Setting and theme are beautifully integrated into the gameplay.  Really a nicely done package, and a great play.

One euro game that I really think is what euro is supposed to be. 

Here the board unlike most euro isn't just some abstract thing with numbers and places for stacks of cards. The board pictures planet Mars and through the course of the game you can see how it slowly turns into green planet with forests, oceans and cities. 

Strong and engaging theme, solid mechanics, that feeling that you build something.

I dont regret impulse buying it.

Only downside is production quality.

RATING: 6
Reasonably good game although my main issue is that the game is too luck dependent (even with drafting variant) for the long playlength. If your initial hand of 10 cards isn't particularly good you can find yourself behind from the very start. This has happened to me too often for me to be able to say that I enjoy this game. Perhaps the game would have been improved with some sort of systemisation of the the deck, similar to through the Ages where cards are introduced at appropriate times.

Great game but I think strategy is a bit deterministic given the card draws. Perhaps playing with the drafting rules would address this.

RATING: 8
Reminds me a lot of Race for the Galaxy - You find yourself with a handful of cards and you have to create a strategy with them.  You must decide how to balance the short-term and long-term potential of those cards against the short-term and long-term cost of holding and deploying those cards.  Add some tile-playing and resource management to the mix.  (Based on 2 plays)

Solo Play: 
This is a game which is designed with the solo gameplay in mind, and it really does show. The solo gameplay of 14 generations create its own set of challenge, with the building of engine in the first 7 rounds or so, while balancing the global parameters increase. Highly recommend to those who refuse solo gameplay altogether, cause this is a whole set of challenge. 

Multiplayer: 
Multiplayer is a different case. Instead of only focusing on engine building in the first few rounds, you have to keep your fellow terraformers under check, and increase your engine efficiency, while keeping in mind the map orientation and availability. 

Would recommend to all to try out.

RATING: 7.5
After one play I really do enjoy this game, but I'm not sure I understand it yet. I was kind of scratching my head the entire game at what my best move was. What card was best to play. What strategy I could go for that would yield the most points. I just went with the flow, and that's fine! I just don't think I'd do too well against someone who knows the game. I need more plays, dammit!

RATING: 3
As they were explaining the game, my excitement was growing, loved the initial idea of colonising Mars, creating oxygen and increasing the temperature. Then, you start realising that many action cards are unbalanced, so I suppose by your 3rd game you will recognise them immediately and start filtering those off, while letting go the crappy ones.
The board is neatly done, but the player sheets are very bad quality, feels like print and play. The artwork in the cards is terrible: it goes from actual pictures to psychedelic drawings.
Player interaction is minimal, you might as well play on your own and compare scores with your friends, it will save you time.

If the people teaching the game forget to mention that there's a new player variant, you will have a miserable first-play story. It dumps ten cards on you right off the bat, which you now need to evaluate as to whether you want to keep them or not, and your early game is heavily dependent on you making the right decisions before you understand the rhythm of play and the relative values of cash, cards, and other resources. Having to pay 3€ to keep each card, both here and after each round, is quite punishing, as it requires you to decide if you want to be able to play something before you can play it. New players are terrified of closing off options, and wind up overpaying for chaff they won't use.

Fantastic game design, graphic design and production quality. I am not giving it a higher rating simply because the game is fairly long and that keeps me from wanting to play it repeatedly. 

My first game was with 5 new players, none of which had read the rules and it took us about 4 hours. We used the basic corporations, kept all 10 of our starting cards for free, and started at 0 on each production track.

My second game was with 4 players, each of which had played a couple times and it took us about 3 hours. We used the advanced corporations and cards, paid for our starting cards, started at 1 on each production track, and drafted our cards each round.

Having these multiple variants that can be used to alter the ease of learning the game and modify the length of the game is very helpful. 

I do love everything about the game, except the length!

This game should be called Imperial Settlers in Spaaaaaaceeee! Terraforming Mars is just a re-theme of older Portal game, which is in turn... Ahem. Basically, if you have one, there is no need to get the other, unless, of course you are the fan of Kim Stanley Robinson books. Differences between the games can not be characterized in other way than cosmetics.
What I like about this game is the fact that everything is explained with icons, making it almost language independent, and therefore more appropriate to be played with younger players.
Terraforming Mars may not be as original as I hoped it to be, but it is really good game. If you prefer SF over history theme, it is a recommended purchase.

RATING: 5.5
I guess this is an ok game, but nothing really stands out as particularly innovative or flavorful. Yes, we are terraforming Mars and everything is in it's place to make that clear...still there's no exploration, no "movement" on the map, no sending things to Mars or out of Mars, no mechanics that involves the population of the cities we are building, no events. Soon, the map becomes a huge bag of points you begin to depend on in mid-late game, when you happen to draw cards that can't immediatly help your engine. In this sense, the game feel like another overcosted card game, with the components and all attached to it to make it "bigger" by not really that more interesting. Speaking about that, i personally think that better solutions could have been found to tie cards to game mechanics, instead than confine them to a draft completely disjointed by whatever is happening elsewhere in the game. Designers, in a sense, should sooner or later accept that if there is randomness and a considerable luck factor in their games, and they can't or don't want to directly fix that, well, they should deal with it and try to get advantage of it from other sides, not throw in a draft and hope the players will be convinced they are playing a fair game. Instead, half of the duration of this game will be spent waiting for other players to make up their minds about cards, and in the end someone will still got the worst side of it because the game won't be any less random as a result. Please STOP these draft going rampant everywhere in games!

Wow, while I have only played this game three times I love it! Time flies by as I work on building up my production and playing really cool theoretically possible cards.

Heavily hyped but not that fun in a 5 player setting.  Too much dependency on card draw luck.  Expanse of the board makes it very difficult to track other player's progress which is important.  Finally, my biggest complaint of all, the player board is AWFUL.  One misplaced sneeze, bump or dropping of a cube and your trackers and resources can all be misplaced ending the integrity of the game.  Dumb dumb dumb.

Seul sur Mars à plusieurs :
On sent un gros travail de documentations.
Dans le genre , c'est certainement un excellent jeu au vu des appréciations.
Mais pour moi un jeu ou chacun fait sa réussite ( sans contrôle évident) , dans un mode multi-joueurs , est 
vite ennuyeux sur la durée de la partie (environ 2h30 à 3h à 4 joueurs).
les + :
Thème bien travaillé et exploité.
Renouvellement certain.
On se fait son petit film.

Les - :
Visuel et matériel qui ne sont pas vraiment à mon gout.
Pioche des cartes (on peut attendre longtemps la bonne étoile)
Sensation de faire une "réussite" dans son coin en mode multi-joueur.
Interaction réduite.
Manque de tension.

This game has been a breath of fresh air, not so much for being mechanically innovative (it is not), but for just simply being fun to play. While it is not easy to pinpoint the exact source of this fun, I suspect it has something to do with the wide open thematic vistas that one gets to explore with this game. The enormous quantity of cards and the multitude of ways that they can make the game unfold means that every new game session provides novelty and the excitement of new discovery. Ultimately this must be the secret sauce in all great games.

TM was the hype train of 2016, and in my opinion well deserved. It hits the right spot in terms of complexity and accessibility, making it ideal for the more experienced gamers, as well as the casual gamers. The core mechanics are surprisingly easy to get into, but the layers and depth of strategy is enough for experience gamers to bite into. 

I feel TM used the Martian theme in a thought-provoking and educative way.

It's fun to have an engine builder where you can still play after the engine fires up. In most engine builders, the moment your engine clicks the game effectively ends. 
Because the end-conditions are attached to the board, and not the deck in front of you, players are able to experience their engine humming away.

Terraforming Mars is a fantastic engine-building game. There are so many cards and so many paths that you can go on based on that path. You can focus on cards or throwing out tiles on the board, or focusing on your terraforming rating. You must play with the advanced corporations and drafting to get the true spirit of the game. My biggest quibble is that the game probably lasts 30 minutes longer than it feels it should.

Sleeved. Bought new from Amazon.  Love this game.  Upped its rating after getting in a couple more plays.  Every game I have played has been fairly close, which makes the decisions you make even more important.  From placing tiles on the board, to generating points from your cards, to the awards and milestones, there are numerous ways to score points while building your tableau and resource producing engine.  The vast number of project cards in the game make every game different. This is in my top five now!

It's very good.  It just didn't surprise me enough - and the elements that did surprise me were generally negative ones - risky luck of the draw especially, and the prospect that card knowledge will end up being the crucial factor.  These were elements that I didn't enjoy in Race for the Galaxy; this at least has the benefit of board play as well.

Terraforming Mars is an interesting tableau building game. I really like that every card is unique and that the corporations give you asymmetric starting positions. It's a little fiddly, and I think you lose something with fewer than 3 players. The solo game is a bit of a let down, since it adds a timer and asks you to terraform Mars within that timeframe, which is not what I look for in a solo implementation.

Just purchased and played first game.  Took a little bit to get into the groove on how the game works, but caught on after a couple of rounds of play.  Discovered there are many strategic approaches to the game and you may have to adjust mid-game based on how things play out.  Our game did take quite a bit of time (2-1/2 hours), but it went fast as you were constantly thinking through options going forward.  I am sure more experience with the game will shorten time.  Strong recommendation - lots of fun.

My personal game of the year 2016. This one kind of hit me by surprise as I had no knowledge of it prior to the release at Gen Con. The tableau card driven, engine building is among the best I have ever seen. It also has just the right amount of brain burn for a medium / heavy Euro. The semi co-op game play really isn't co-op at all, and suits my tastes just right.  Only downsides are some of the components are pretty poor quality, particularly the player boards, but the cards are nice and very well illustrated.  Overall, Good stuff...

Played twice. An upper-tier tableau building game. I particularly like the three parameters of temperature, oxygen levels and oceans are thematically integrated into the endgame conditions as well as the cost conditions for several cards. The card design is a little Eklund-esque, but generally gets the job done.

Unlike other users who have commented, I actually didn't have a problem with downtime in 5P games. I think that as strategies gradually solidify, it becomes easier to assess what cards are important to you.

This rating may go up - first play was interesting, thematically immersive, interesting choices. Would have marked higher but for the feeling of a growing sense of AP possibilities the longer the game went on - and it went fairly long. But enjoyable all the same. *UPDATE* further plays were enjoyable but I'm not sure I go along with the consensus that rates TM as one of the best strategy games out there. There is certainly a lot of variation and replay value, but for me I don't know that the experience of play justifies the rather long amount of time it takes: it really does eat up the evening, even with a mere 3 players. When I'm playing it, it's enjoyable. When I'm not playing though, I don't yearn to play it again.

[3 plays] Highly thematic gameplay with some serious science that could be used to teach a high school science class combined with a "recipe game" style that I enjoy.

Interaction and screw-you plays are somewhat limited, but there are enough to keep it from being mutiplayer solitaire. I really enjoyed my first play of Terraforming Mars.

Amazing game, at first it can be a bit intimidating, but once you understand the different mechanisms and their relation, it's not a complex game to play.

I love that every turn you have to decide if you really want to purchase new cards spending resources, this limitation forces you to plan strategies depending on the board state and the rest of your hand.

The engine building part it's excellent, there are a lots of card synergies and combinations that are viable to win which makes every game feels unique. The addition of the different corporations makes the variability of the game even higher.

The game can take quite a long time if nobody is rushing to end the game (2h-3h), but it is so fun that I don't really notice it.

I'm relatively new to these types of games, but I love this game.  I've only played it a few times and will play it anytime I can get it to the table.  Not crazy about the player boards (like everyone else) and ordered overlays and backs from boardgames boost like I did with Great Western Trail.  These are great, but greatly added to the cost of the game.

Хорошая игра, но не зацепила. Нет в ней собранности какой-то, слишком много возможностей, которые игру разжижают. Также нету сильного взаимодействия с игроками. Оформление (даже со скидкой на локализацию) хромает.

RATING: 7.5
A well designed tableau building driven resource collection game. A very immersive and topical theme makes it the highly rated game that it is. But not up my wheelhouse. The randomness of the card draw and the difficulty in parsing the game state due to large players' tableaux make this a not so interesting game for me.

RATING: 10
A breath of fresh air (ironically enough..):  somehow old school but somehow innovative.  

Multiple (as in at least four quite distinct) strategic paths that all seem viable and can be mixed and matched.  The flavor of the cards (the meat of the game) is both interesting and sometimes quite funny.

There was more downtime than I'm comfortable with in a five player game; prefer four players.  

Update: after a half dozen plays, it appears to be quite replayable.  This game is a gem!

Terraforming Mars is a well-made game. There is some luck, there is some kingmaking. And there is a lot of vicious competition, since blocking players out is the most effective way to play the game.
The game is a bit long for what it is, especially given how little influence one has on the cards. In theory, this might get better if everyone at the table knows all the cards. Actually getting the cards would still be random.
While this lessens the fun for me, the game itself clearly is very good.

Some say the science in this is pretty good, and in any case makes a great game.

Update: LOVE it. Really, really good Euro game with fantastic theme/integration. Played 3p and we all liked it a lot. A lot of different ways to get your engine going, good resource management, and even though the cards could be generic I feel like the theme really comes through. It's science fiction but the science is enough to be really engaging. I think I gotta get my own copy.

One of the best eurogames I've played. It reminds me of Race for the Galaxy -- which is also one of the few eurogames I [i]really[/i] enjoy -- but with a board.

There's some interaction, but only of the "I take away what you want to do next" kind.

A játékosok a Mars bolygó terraformálásban vesznek részt közösen egy-egy multi céget alakítva, a játék végén a legtöbbet a célért tevő aratja le a babérokat. Kártyák kijátszásával vízeket fedezhetünk fel, növeljük a bolygó felszínének hőmérsékletét és oxigéndúsabbá tehetjük a légkört.
Tetszett a játék euró volta ellenére az erős tematikussága. Minden kártya különböző, rendkívül kidolgozottak és jók a mellékelt tematikus szövegek rajtuk. A bolygón a városok és növényzet terjeszkedése felgyorsul a hőmérséklet és oxigén növekedés hatására. Tetszett a térképen a különböző táj- és épületelemek egymásra hatása.
Nem tetszettek a díjak és mérföldkövek. A mérföldkövekből 3 váltható meg a játék során egyenként 8 pénzért, amikor teljesítette valaki a feltételét, ezekért 5 pont jár a játék végén. A díjak viszont 8-14-20 pénzbe kerülnek egymás után, itt viszont a játék végén nézzük meg, hogy az adott feltételben ki bizonyult a legjobbnak és ő kapja az 5 pontot, a második 2-őt. Nem értem, hogy egy bizonytalan, szerencsén is múló dolog miért drágább. Sok a mérföldkövekért kapható pont is. Nem tetszett, hogy van nyersanyag, ami a játék vége felé semmit nem ér, nem hasznosítható, erre figyelhettek volna. Bár kiegészítőben biztosan orvoslásra kerül. Négy új lapot kapunk körönként, amiből megvásárolhatunk. Ezt kevésnek éreztem és nagyon szerencsefüggőnek. Lehet jobb lett volna ide valami draftolós mechanizmus, bár akkor még hosszabb lett volna a játék. Legjobban a játékidő nem tetszett. 3-an 3 órán át játszottunk. Izgalmas volt, de ennyi nincs ebben a játékban. Kicsit rövidebbre is tervezhették volna.
Lehetett volna egy nagyon jó játék is ebből, de kicsit csalódtam az eddigi pozitív kommentek után.

Easily one of my favourite games. Perfectly blends Euro mechanics and cards with the theme of terraforming Mars. Every card is unique and every hand, I find myself looking for new card combination possibilities. Players of all skills can compete, with the winner usually having played a very potent combo which makes post-game analysis interesting.

Minor negative: the components and some of the card art are not to the same level as the gameplay itself, but don't find that it detracts from the experience.

RATING: 5
I don't mind the game, but it's overrated and doesn't deserve to be in top 10. I'm sorry but this game has no business being in the top 10 nor should it be rubbing shoulders with the likes of Scythe or Terra Mystica.

This is NOT a strategy game. There are no difficult decisions to make. All you need to do is some simple math conversion to figure out the best value cards to play or which ever builds/exploits your engine. It's basically a race game. 

Premise is simple: buy cards that either give you more resources, build an engine, or take resources away from someone. Then use resources for VP. Pretty standard fare.

Cons: Looooong play time for a fairly simple game. No box insert (components are expected to just free fall around in their baggies). The publisher cheaped out on the player mats which aren't very functional. Only 2 sets of crib provided. Art direction is horrible - inconsistent mix of art and cheap looking stock photos which really hurts the aesthetic.

Pros: Cool theme that works well with the mechanic.

RATING: 7
Not quite sure why this one exploded as much as it has (currently rank 10 as of typing this). It is certainly a serviceable, above average, if not very good design. I just didn't feel like it brought anything new to the table. The player boards are a bit of a mess, so easy to knock cubes around. Is it the theme? I did think the theme was quite cool, which I why I was initially excited to give it ago. Is it a refinement of what has already been done before? It really felt like it was just a middling tableau builder with some decent board elements. Maybe there's a lot more to explore, but my first play didn't grab me enough to be excited about said exploration. I wouldn't turn down further play as of yet.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Rambling tangent:
There have been a couple new hotness games that have skyrocketed to the top of the charts that I just haven't really understood. Maybe I'm just settling into the scene after 5 and a half years. 
It seems like the first game to crack the slowly moving top 10 or 20 was Pandemic Legacy. It really shook things up, and probably for good reason. I am currently playing through it and enjoying it immensely. I am tempted to even give it a 9 or a 10 rating for doing what it it was designed to do [I]really[/I] well. 

Then there was Scythe. I think a huge reason Scythe has done so well is marketing and art direction. The game is good, but I really fail to see the hype. It was another, like Terraforming Mars, that when I actually played it, my experience fell far short of my expectations.  How is Scythe #6 overall? I feel like Stegmaier is a fantastic businessman who has been creating these middling games and marketing them really well. I've only played a couple, but not a single one has blown me away. 

Then we have Terraforming Mars, which I have discussed above. An ok game, but #10 of all time? Really?

Then there's Gloomhaven. Where did this come from? It bursted on the scene without me even really getting a glimpse of it approaching. I have not yet played it, so cannot pass judgement. #7 overall ATM, and likely to rise. This at least appears like another boon in the marketing strategy. I would love to try it someday, but I feel like I'll need to wait a couple print runs until the dust settles. 

There's only one old guard left in the top 10 from when I started gaming- Twilight Struggle. It's possibly the best game left in those ranks, though I imagine I'd love the new edition of TTA, and hope to try it someday. 

I think a lot of the above phenomena ultimately has to do with the hobby increasing in popularity, and therefore stuff being printed now is getting A TON of exposure, reaching a wider audience than ever before, This is making new stuff sift to the top at a much higher rate. I guess I am just sad that stuff I adore is being pushed out of the top 100. All this said, I am pleased as punch that this hobby is flourishing and especially that the Brass Kickstarter is doing so swimmingly (one of the good oldies that is reaching a brand new audience!).

Rating after one play:

Good - The game feels really unique and is fun. It is primarily driven via the cards that you draw and finding synergy between them. It feels like there are a lot of different combos to be made which is great. I found myself thinking about all of the possibilities in the game the day after we played it.

Bad - The component quality, graphic design, and the card artwork are atrocious. The box is thin, the game board doesn't lay flat and the insert came ripped. The art on the cards is a mix of real photos (that look like stock photos), clip art, and decent illustrations. The player mats look like they were designed by a high school student in MS Word. And the worst part is that this game retails for $70!! Blood Rage retails for $80 and it is packed full of minis. There is no reason that this game should be $70. 

The game also overstays it's welcome. It feels like the game should have ended a couple rounds sooner. Our first game with four players took about 2.5 hours. Terraforming Mars isn't a heavy game. 2.5 hours is just too long for a game that is this light. I hope the play time gets better with more plays.

Have only played the basic game so far. Enjoyed a lot, The heart of the game lies in the cards so I could see this game making some people unhappy with bad card draws. This can probably be mitigated a fair bit with the drafting system (which I haven't tried yet). That said, I'm pretty tickled. I didn't mind getting random cards. Lots of strategy choices, other players matter, not just for the occasional "take that" elements, but because you're trying to beat them in achieving certain milestones. My only real problem with the game is the fiddlyness. There are lots of "when you play that you get those and then that means you get that too" added to "oh, and that card ALSO means you get that". It can be a little brain burny for that reason.

The game is also quite attractive, barring the somewhat dull looking planet itself (and it looks better as soon as you start planting trees and creating oceans). I love the goofy cubes for keeping track of your resources. The tracks on your individual player mats are prone to being knocked so that's a slight ding (it didn't bother us).

This is not one of those games with a resource/card mechanic that quickly becomes an abstract number/cube comparison while the theme drops away.   The game's theme is relentlessly present.   There are a huge number of cards and each is completely unique.   The designer has certainly spent a lot of thought in creating such an amazing variety of theme-driven approaches to achieve the objectives of the game.   A great game, easy to pick up and get going with.

No esta mal el juego. Un poco duro, no apto para principiantes. Un problema son los materiales q son de muy mala calidad, además de q hay muy poca variedad, en el sentido de que se usan los mismos para todo. Las partidas se hacen muy largas. La estrategia es difícil de variar, si vas mal al principio, te esperan de dos a tres horas de ver cómo se divierten el resto. Demasiado azar.

One of the best eurogames I have played in my time.  The existence of the three goals of oxygen, temperature, and water and then the backdrop of the different milestones and awards to obtain makes the rules easy to explain and understand, but hard to master.  Cardplay is very well done and above all, the theme really shines through with every card and action.  Very impressed with TM!  Just wish the quality was better -- the boards are flimsy and the components, while pretty, are very underwhelming.  Thank goodness the art is excellent.

A fairly complex game to get into.  A pseudo-cooperative game where everyone shares the same goal, which is to terraform Mars until it's habitable.  Scoring at the end of  the game is based largely on how much each player contributed to the project.  While the focus is on a shared goal, there's plenty of opportunities to screw your opponents, if you choose to play that way.

It's good, but I struggle to see how it's an amazing game from 2016. Here's what I like: the theme is cool, and the cards are actually quite thematic. I like that there are a couple of different elements that are changing (temperature, oxygen levels) and that they allow or prohibit the use of certain cards. I think that the problem is that I didn't really enjoy how the card management played out in this one. I wanted to buy cards to keep my options open, yet I was ovewhelmed by the number of options. The penalty for buying a bunch of cards was not overly high (at least to my untrained eye) and so I felt encouraged to keep the tension of which cards to buy. Certainly, I had overbought cards, which meant I had a lot to choose from, but even so, I felt that a good portion of the game I was bogged down as it was difficult to get them into play. I guess that I felt the game was really a slog and it was tough to feel that I got much of an engine going, as I could maybe play only a single card each turn.

Rating based on one play in basic mode. Seems to be a really promising game with lots of tough decisions to be made throughout the rounds. I wanted this to immediately grab me and make me want more, but I didn't quite feel the addiction for it. I think the less than appealing art and iconography might have something to do with it. And at the end of the day, everyone's just there playing their cards into their stacks to build up an engine and activate powers. Still, a solid offering.

Currently my favourite board game! Just fantastic. Beautiful artwork and great game mechanics - I enjoy this everytime. I like the slow build up whilst you are building your engine and then the heavy last few rounds where you have many options open to you and are competing with other players over completing the 3 game ending conditions and for the best spots on the board. The player mats and general component quality is poor but I love everything else about this game. It plays very well at all player counts, including 2 player (and solo!)

A terrific game of hand management (drafting a set of cards each round to work towards your strategy) and tableau building (every card gives you a unique power), with variable powers (corporations give unique setup and in-game powers). Theme comes through from the cards. Best way to play: with corps and advanced card (0 starting income except corp), pay for initial cards, draft each round. Many paths to victory.

Very much looking forward to playing this again!

Purchased this game on a whim because of the solo potential.  I'm in the process of learning to play it so can't comment or rate the gameplay.  But I will put up a provisional rating for the components.  They are very sub par.  The box is low quality.  The insert is the worst I've seen for years, it was useless and ripped in numerous places on opening and made of rubbish cardboard.  The cards and player board card stock is wafer thin.  To top it off, the first player marker is a big round planet token with a 1 on it.  Very unimaginative.   I'm extremely disappointed in the component quality, and at this stage think I've thrown some good money away.  let's hope the gameplay can raise it a notch or two.

This is an incredible game.  In this game each of the players is terraforming Mars to make it habitable for human beings.  Once there is enough water, oxygen, and heat on the planet for human beings to survive the game ends and the player who contributed most to the effort is the winner.

The gameplay is almost entirely made up of three components.  The first, and largest, is tableau building.  The game is entirely driven by a project deck you buy cards from each round.  The cards do everything from increase the levels of water, oxygen, and heat on the planet to provide you with pets to cuddle on Mars.  The second is tile placement.  While we are developing Mars we are adding oceans, greenery, and city tiles to a map and their placement matters a lot for end game scoring.  The final component is the resource economy.  There are 6 different main resources to manage, each of them being varying degrees of important depending on the strategies you choose to pursue and many more ancillary resources can enter the game through project cards.

I absolutely love games with a lot of content and high replay value.  After one play I knew I would love this game.  And this was even the "beginner" mode where a third to a half of the "advanced" project cards were removed and we played with the same beginner corporations with no powers.  I also love games with asynchronous player powers so I'm sure I will enjoy future games more.  My first game was also with the max 5 players and the main concern I had going into the game was whether or not the max player count would crowd the map too much.  Now my main concern is that with fewer it would be too open taking away meaningful decisions and player interaction.  We did go through the entire project deck but this was also with a huge chunk of it removed.

The game itself is great but it also has serious component issues in my opinion.  The cards, player cubes, and tiles are fine and the rulebook is actually pretty well written but past that it could use some serious love.  The board is tiny and crowded, it makes an otherwise epic feeling game feel much smaller.  The player boards suffer in the same way being thin paper boards with sections for each of the resources.  Resources you collect a lot of and can easily lose your place do to an errant elbow.  And finally, the resource cubes (the same ones are used for everything which is fine since there are 6+ resources in the game) are of terrible quality.  My copy (which I got used) has supposedly only been played 3 times now and according to the previous owner the paint on these cubes was already peeling and warping when he opened it.  A quick search online reveals this is a pretty common complaint.

It's sad because such a great game deserves better care.  This has actually been a common occurrence with Stronghold Games in my opinion (although there are worse offenders, like Splotter Spellen).  They get hold of such great games but the best level the components have ever reached for me has been mediocre.  And this one certainly falls closer to "poor".

Third Printing Error:  We changed Mining Guild to the 3rd printing (from July 2017) to make its effect clearer. It triggers on the placing of a tile, not on getting any steel or titanium, so we added the asterisks and changed the explanation text.
Unfortunately, it seems the factory formatting didn't catch the text over spill, but we'll fix that now for further printings.

Great engine building game. Everything feels well-integrated and coherent, with several different paths to explore. It suffers a bit from the "VP salad" issue, but so many games currently do... 

I would probably buy a second version with upgraded art, though, and would certainly be glad if they found a way to slice off 30 minutes to its 3 hours duration, as it slightly overstays its welcome, but still, it has enough depth to have a lasting appeal and everything is fluid. This superb game currently sits in my top 10 (0.5 taken away for visuals and duration).

After several games, we took out the corporation cards (add length, because they are not often helping with terraforming). We play with the different starting corporations, though. 
After more plays, we stopped the drafting and instead, gave 6 cards to everyone, allowing players to keep a maximum of 4. It speeds up play.

My new favorite solo game. Terraforming Mars is a ton of fun, it's deep but relatively simple and flows very nicely. The gameboard and all the cube pieces that come with it are very high quality with lots of colors and detail. The mechanics of the game are flawless and the best part about TFM is that even when you lose the game, you realize some of the mistakes you made and have that much more knowledge for the next time you play, which is usually as soon as you finish your first playthrough. 10/10 must have for solo gamers. Haven't tried it with multiple people though...

RATING: 6
Very nicely produced. All unique cards that help you build a solitaire engine that lay tiles and move tokens up and down tracks - either global tracks (up) or 6 on your own board (up or down). Some small interaction in racing for milestones ,a little bit of dickery (including negative drafting) and board placement. Only 2 plays but it is looooong (at least with my group and drafting). Thematically engaging (both the terraforming part and the rival corporations competing). 

Card draw (even with drafting) adds a lot of randomness to VP outcomes (which i quite like)

After 5 plays I am finding the arc of the game too long and a little bit too own tableau for my tastes.

Excellent game. Yes, components could (should?) be better and art direction has some misses. However, it's not possible to not feel the guenine passion for the theme and science that the author have. Even if this is not an educational game, the way Mars is terraformed by the players makes most of the time sense (the principles, not the details: this is not a NASA outreach project!). I will never see the red planet terraformed (some scientists argue it's even impossible to do) and I am not sure to still be there to watch the first Mars manned mission. However, thanks to Terraforming Mars, I fulfill by playing one of my space dreams...

This has almost everything I want in a board game -- hyper competitive area control, engine building, thematic. Almost my "grail" game. But it feels like a flawed experience because of how card are chosen. If you have the bad luck of getting cards that don't synergize with your corp, then it really screws you over for the rest of the game. A draft might solve this. Not sure, but it feels like there could be improvement there.

We played with just the beginner companies and that created some really bad imbalances between the people playing. I want to play it again with the names companies to see if that creates a more balanced experience. 

Second play with named companies plus advanced cards. This was a much more enjoyable experience. I spent the entire game with a hand of cards I was slowly playing to the table and they all built towards a goal. Much more fun.

Very good game.  I went in skeptical because it doesn't look like much except hella complicated.  But in retrospect, I am impressed by the depth in the game and the opportunity for different strategies.  But even considering the different paths to victory, in my first game (with five players) the difference between first and last place was only 12 points - a sign of true balance!  But as much as I like the game I doubt I will buy it as I think it will be too hard to get to the table.

Wow.  Finally got to play this and was impressed.  VERY fun game, will play this anytime.

Now that I have many plays under the belt I can describe this game in more detail.

This game should take you about 2 hours to play.  The biggest drag on this is if you draft.  i get that people like drafting, as they think that it will let them see more cards.  The problem is that the cards that get passed to you have been sifted for the best stuff, and often they have been hate drafted to you.  This leaves you, on average, with fewer useful cards each game, and the game takes at least an extra 45 minutes.  An experienced player will understand that cards are NOT the only way to get points or build your engine.  So a bad card draw where you ditch all four cards really is no big deal.  Bad cards only matter to the player that is literally sifting the deck for the one specific card they think they need .

As is, the game is an acceptable length (shorter IS better after all), but much more than that and you can start looking at your watch, wondering if you'll get to play anything else after this one ends.  The average player will be surprised often by the winner as the points aren't quite clear, though with experience it can become pretty clear who is going to win, even though there is still another 30 minutes left to play.  This is fine so long as you enjoy playing it as much as I do.

I'm not one for theme to matter in general, but this one really hits my sweet spot.  I will play this multiple times in the same day which is unheard of for me.  I would rate it an 11 if possible.  Just, please, no drafting....

I have to ammend this 10.  It is a 10 so long as there is no drafting.  With drafting it falls all the way down to a 5 or a 6 at best.  Friends don't let friends draft.

Great long game - can degrade into a matter of 'luck of draw'.  (2-player drafting variant - round 10+ wife draws 9 of the Jovian multiplier cards, and deploys them - game over... yea 2 hours and then a flurry of luck).  (several games my tableau cards were negated nearly completely by a single card from the other player - now I get to sit here and feed their engine for 1.5 hours)(depending on the Corporation cards - the entire game will require a reaction to the card - this element can chain the game down to series of tactics... maybe less interesting.)  My rating for this game ignores the games I've played which I disliked.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Good game somewhat tied to its theme. My reluctance comes mostly from my personal taste not a fault in the design itself.
Each turn your company become 10% more efficient which translate to 10% longer turn. By the end of the game it accumulates to lots of action to consider, drafting being harder to manage, lots of down time, lots of power to keep track of and lots of resources to manage. You get information overload from managing your turn so forget about tracking what your neighbour are doing or tracking the obfuscated scoring.

Love the theme of this game but I am not over the moon about the execution.  The game pieces are well made except for the player mats which are flimsy and are not up to the challenge  of holding all the play pieces properly.  A Scythe like system is needed.  Its a bit of a brain burner working all the aspects of the player cards.  Need a couple more plays before I know if this is a keeper or not.

RATING: 5.5
Tableau-builder sort of reminiscent of Phil Eklund's recent output in its combination of vaguely scientific basis and large numbers of unique cards with special powers. Players build up six different kinds of income (!) which can be spent either on cards, things worth victory points, or to change certain global parameters. These global parameters indicate the progress of terraforming -- i.e. the increase of oxygen levels, global temperature and water to a level capable of sustaining life -- and trigger both the end-game and restrict the play of various cards, e.g. you can't introduce fish into the oceans while the oceans are frozen solid so temperatures must rise substantially.

While the thematic integration is pleasant I am not convinced at all by the cards. A large number of unique cards is fine and dandy, but players generally pick up at most 4 per turn. There are a limited number of other opportunities to draw, but card cycling is not a focus as it is in e.g. Race for the Galaxy. While many cards are good, it's difficult to deliberately pursue synergies and play is likely to be extremely tactical.

To be clear, I'm not saying that card synergies are impossible. They are, in fact, required to win. Rather, the issue is that luck of the draw is substantial and there are limited avenues for mitigation. I would never play again without the drafting variant, which in my experience does tend to leave players with cards more useful to them than not (i.e. minimal hate-drafting). But it is still uncomfortably easy to have, for example, a starting company that gives a bonus for building with titanium and then never getting a titanium production card.

A number of cards also have a "take that" element, usually of the form that a target players loses X resources or Y income. They're rare enough that these attacks aren't constant, but they do compound an already capricious card pool.

It's not a bad game, just not a great one.

In this game we are terraforming Mars. The player gets cards and has to choose what cards to buy or not buy as all the cards cost resources to achieve. The players goals are terraforming mars to raise the heat the oxygen and  build oceans. At 14% oxygen 8C heat and 9 oceans the game goes through one more greenery purchasing phase than commences. The players also can purchase awards or a chance to contend at the end of the game for victory point competitions. All the victory point competitions are not up for grabs and a player buys the right to compete that gets more expensive every time. 
Players get victory points based on how many greeneries are around the city and how many greeneries they have in the first place.

Rating is with the drafting variant. 

Fun engine builder with a good tension in the race for achievement and milestone awards. I enjoy the map bonuses and tile placement. 

The most fun part of the game for me is to play cards with cool and hopefully synergistic effects. Unfortunately I sometimes feel a little frustrated when I don't get playable cards or the "tags" I want.

It is a little too long playtime for what it is and I don't like the direct player attacks.

This is an outstanding game! Love the thematic synergies, tons of interesting choices (game never dragged), and fairly easy to learn (but still feels quite meaty). 

The design hits on a lot of different cylinders (card play, resource management, tile laying, goal achievement, tableau building, etc.).

Production values are good (with a few minor exceptions), while the luck of the draw can have a moderate effect on the game. Drafting is available, but it does increase play time by 15 minutes or so (recommended).

TM excels at giving players a real sense of purpose and satisfaction - it's extraordinarily  thematic. Indeed, this may just be the most thematic game I've ever played.

For those concerned with the slight "Take that!" element of card-play, don't be - it's relatively minor (not that many cards), and they help keep the game balanced. Good feature in my view.

As if that wasn't enough, the solo game is very good (difficult to win and plays fast).  It plays similar to the multi-player version, but with different goals (so you'll need to adjust some of your strategies).

Extremely replayable, even after 12 sessions it still seems fresh to me. The 200+ card deck is awesome!

Lots of hype surrounding this release, and yet it meets and even exceeds that hype. TM has strong potential to be a major hit, I believe. 

Best "Game of the Year" so far!

Pushes all the right buttons. Decent amount of replayability, unique player powers, a combination of both resource management and game progression. Overall a very solid game that does a lot of things very good.

My complaints on the game are that while it has a decent amount of replayability I wish there was more (hopefully an expansion will solve that). Also, some cards are insanely powerful early game (like the "discount future cards played" ones) and many others are completely useless depending on too many situations. I also feel like there isn't as much long term planning as I'd like. Like if there was something akin to the 6-cost developments in Race for the Galaxy that give you huge end game points and guide your overall strategy. There are a few cards that synergize together and push you in a certain strategy (like the research resource one or the animal growing card), I feel like the game would be improved with more cards like that. Finally, there is a bit too much "take that" on some aspects of the game that are hard to mitigate if everyone gangs up on you.

Definitely good though and highly recommended. Hope they do an expansion for it and soon!

Fantastic game, perfect for space and/or science enthusiast - potentially a must have. Many of the developments and events in the game are based on actual ideas for terraforming Mars. The games does an excellent job of mixing real science into a fun game. At the end of the game, your group will collectively build cities, create lakes, and cover the surface of Mars in plants, animals and possibly even pets (there's a card for our four legged friends in there). While there are many routes to victory (points), regardless of who wins or losses, everyone works together to collectively transform Mars into a livable planet, leave everyone with a sense of satisfaction. The one shortfall of this game is there can be moments of the game that can feel not entirely smooth or polished, keeping this game from a perfect 10. Who am I kidding! Despite a few rough spots here and there, this game is excellent and deserves a 10!

Really good game.  A lot of great things going on, but component quality is horseshit.  I personally hate the metallic cubes in general, why could different color cubes just be used?  If the table is bumped this game is toast.  A cube floating into the wrong box could be game breaking.  Also, every single card being unique is rough but at the same time something I enjoy.  There are just so many cards to know and so many in general that forming  a strategy I would imagine is difficult, also can get a bit unbalanced when someone knows the cards much better than others.  It's a very reactive game, your corporation determines what you are looking for and then you have to react to the cards you are dealt in order to maximize your ability and production stats.  I actually enjoy that part the most!  Placing of tiles is interesting, and i really enjoy the end game conditions.  Getting all three tracks to max capacity allows the game to progress differently each time and ensures some cards are more or less powerful in different games.  That randomness could also kill an individual game as you may only see cards that are useless for that particular game-flow.  Interesting game I'd like to explore more.

Feels a bit too much like Multiplayer Solitaire for my taste, not only in the lack of ineraction (there is a little, which however does not seem to be very decisive) but more within the fact that every Player is basically playing in his own "Card universe" and you do not really particpate what Card Actions and Tactics the other Players are using. Well, of course you can, however this would make the game very slow.

RATING: 9
Game that obviously was designed with a lot of love. It is a very thematic engine building tableau game. 

Rating is for the multi-player experience and is preliminary as so far, I've played multiplayer only once (with the wimpy settings of starting resources and beginner corporations). Surprisingly, this was just an 'ok' experience. As we all not yet knew what we were doing, for most the card pick was not yet clear and it was hard to estimate the time of ending (let alone influence) and this prevented us from pre-arranging ourselves to grabbing the right things at the right time. But all of our gaming group, even our wargaming/competitive buddies, could see the potential.

Now, I have played (and won) the solo game with all corporations but the extended ones, getting 100+ VP consistently. And as a solo game, this game has already proven its' superb design to me. Though some cards are pretty OP in solo (think Aquifer Pumping), it is winnable even without those cards and it is a very enjoyable experience playing it solo. The genius is that the relative card value assigned to each card does vary a lot between solo- and multi-player. As an example, the aforementioned Aquifer Pumping is usually quite worthless in multi-player. I don't care about putting down oceans so other can get more placement bonuses, I'd prefer to focus on oxygen instead. And the 'take that' cards, while sometimes quite valuable in solo, become really great in multi-player. 

Result? I found myself wondering the value of each card I drew.. in solo I'd take Lichen, Advanced Lichen or any other non-prerequisite plant production card anytime but in the full game... it all depended whether I'd go for greeneries and it's corresponding milestones. Or heat. Or money. Or... and you have three other players all scheming as well. 

Fully expect this rating to go up with multiple plays. As a solo game, this game is already rated 9.5 for me. Great game, if you like engine builders you have to pick up this one.

[APR 2017] Played a couple of times multiplayer since and yes, also then it is a winner. What a great thematic game, what a great way to spend time together. Rating revised upwards to a 9

Two player review, 4 plays:

Very good game.  Easy to understand right away.  The engine making usability length is quite rewarding - up until about 1 hour and 45 minutes into it.  Then it feels like it gets a little long.  I'd like to figure out if there was a way to make it 1-1.5 hours long with two.  A that, though, it might take away from the game.  It's wild that the games can be so close with all that work on your own little world. We are trading it due to game length at two.

Very good thematically.
Unfortunately this feels like a gateway game, and I am more interested in deeper games.
Cons
-Almost non exsisting player interaction
-All rounds feels identical, round 1 and round x feels the same because you do the same actions over and over
 -random cards gets dealt to you every round, huge random element. I like to plan my moves, not go with what I get
-many rules that does basically the same (titanium is 3 money, steel is 2 money, oxygen only enables/disables random cards, oceans does nothing other than enabling 1 card, plants only gives 1vp to adjacent city) you could cut half the rules and get the same gameplay but with weaker theme

Will only play draft variant.  In an engine building game of any length and depth, it's not acceptable that luck should determine who ultimately wins the game, and that can definitely happen in this game.  Early synergy can be stumbled upon, and it can give a leg up that can be difficult if not impossible to eventually overcome if another player simply isn't drawing the cards necessary to set up an equivalent engine early enough.  Still, there's a lot of good to this game, and it could have been an 8+ if either the luck element weren't so great or the game weren't as long.  7 is still a considerably high rating, and I do think this game deserves it.  It just isn't the most amazing game ever, and definitely not what I think should make top 100 - most overrated game of the year, imo, but still pretty good.

RATING: 8.5
tl;dr: very good indeed

I played the prototype of this game in late 2014. I quite liked it, but it did still need some work. That came in the form of redoing the turn structure. In the original when it was your turn, you did all your actions. Now you just do one or two actions on your turn and on to the next player. This is a great step forward as it streamlines game play a lot. It makes downtime lower and allows you to think about your actions while other players are at it.
What I like a lot about this game is that it offers a huge amount of variety. The amount of unique cards is staggering but there also seems to be a variety of strategies to explore. In our game one player focused on energy and heat. An other player focused on animals and other cards that gave points. I focused on building cities and greeneries. Scores were pretty close.
There is a tiny bit of take that in the game, but it's not too bad.
The rule book is sometimes a bit confusing, it could have been worded or structured a bit clearer, but in did fall into place pretty nicely when we started playing.
Good stuff. Maybe not the 14th best game of all time, but I haven't agreed with a lot of the current top 20 lately. It seems like new games are being over hyped quite a bit. Good games, but THAT good?

This is one of the best games melding theme and mechanics. Every card and action seems well thought out in a mechanical and thematic way.

I also love the engine building in this game. I really like that you can switch gears partway through the game, which many engine builders don't allow you to do. Also, each game can have something become obsolete at different times, so you can't build your engine the same way every time.

Player interaction can feel a little lower than some people might like, but I feel it's more subtle in ways you don't see until you play it a few times. It's similar to Dominion in this regard.

Either too much or not enough player interaction, it's hard to say which.

Also a few strategies seem to fail abysmally:

Storing heat: As I was working with the green cards all game I just kept amassing heat in storage slowly throughout the game. On just the last turn two players amassed more heat than I accumulated over the entire game.

Animal and plant scoring cards. Does not work to plan for these cards if you don't draw the cards that allow you to play more tokens faster.

Maybe with more plays I'll rant less, but we'll see.

TM is very solitairey - there's not a huge number of times, in the 3 or so hours it might take to play, that you'll be looking that closely at what your opponents are doing, but it is still surprisingly fun to play. The engine building works nicely and the game is pretty smooth to play, though I slightly dislike some of the end game scoring.

-- The player boards are problematic. (!)
- heavily card-based
- a bit too luck-based (getting good cards)
- takes a bit too long

If they do a second edition with improved player boards and a few additions (like e.g. tiles to randomize milestones & awards), it could be really good!

To take cards in your hand, you have to pay money. You need also money to play cards. 

You could play 1 or 2 actions at one time. Sometimes you want only 1 (you see what other players do and could react) sometimes 2 (specially if you don`t want to lose something you have gotten from the first action).

After 2 games I have 2x "but"
-playing time - 4h for a 3P and 3h for 2p is too long, byt maybe after few games, when you know all the cards it would be faster
-"attack cards" - specially at the beginning of a game it could really slow you down

If you know the game the playing time is ok .

Not for 2 players (snowball effect)

My second play was a bit frustrating. I was mostly drawing red cards and nothing I could combo off of. I seemed to always be passing before the other two players and then watching them play the game. Maybe I should have done some more Standard Actions instead of paying for the red cards? Even so, I came in second by 4 points.

Luck of the draw can play a part, but I still like this game a lot. It is making the best with what you draw.

Point salad and no knowing about the game without studying the cards in detail. :( Small type.

Cards are mostly clear, but it's a Deck of Many Things game where you can really only play well knowing how the deck is composed--unless it's remarkably fair and all paths are equal. The deck is huge, so only in a 5p game will you cycle through it, meaning it's essentially a 1D[i]n[/i] system with no really coherent strategy possible--roulette, basically.

Tile buying is more certain, but more expensive. So, you activate cards hoping at random (unless you've analysed the cards) that they will happen to blend into a coherent strategy.

To be sure, optimization is possible, but this is a very beginner-unfriendly game; the antithesis would be a Knizia game where generally all the mechanisms of the game are known from the rules.

This is not a bad game, but I am rating it a 3 based on "Lilely won't play this again". Although the game is a wonderful representation of the Kim Stanley Robinson's series of books on Mars, it is, at it's heart, another dry  multi-solo-player drawn out experience with a burden of additional bookkeeping. If that's your thing, then you'll probably love it but it will never hit the table in our household, and it is unlikely I would want to invest 2-3 hrs of life into.

I like Terraforming Mars well enough but I don't get what's so special about it that it routinely gets multiple full tables at large gaming meetups. Perhaps it's that in the end, there's very little on top of its core mechanic -- build engine, receive resources, repeat. It's very much a raw engine/tableau builder with no pretenses or distractions like worker placement, auctioning, timed random events, or face-up drafting. And I think that design really speaks to a lot of people: unvarnished and unfiltered access to engine pieces with tempo as the primary indicator of performance.

Lots of cards!

I do enjoy playing but the game is very random due to the card draws and the board feels strangely unimportant.

Race for the Galaxy does do this kind of thing better and quicker.

I like the red event cards, I know some do not.  Without them the game would be way too passive.

I do not have any issue with the components except the player boards. I would advise using D10's or a custom tray for the income cubes because they can easily slide around on the mat.

Overall I think it is a good game, but not great.  I feel it does play too long for what it is.  I would never use drafting for this reason.

Note.
We now use the "Solar Variant" which shortens the game and makes the game more enjoyable for me because I found the game dragged. 

Solar Variant
At the end of each generation, the starting player has an additional phase (the Solar phase) in which he MUST choose to raise one parameter or place an ocean tile. There is no cost to perform that action nor does he gain any TR or tile-placing bonuses. Abilities from any player that trigger when certain parameter raises or when an ocean tile is placed do still apply, though.

There's been a lot of hype around this one.  After one play I can say it lived up to the hype.  The game reminds me a lot of [thing=154203][/thing] in the way that it is mostly multiplayer solitaire with unique races and a similar action system.  However, TM fixes my biggest complaint with Imperial Settlers, which is that your starting cards can single-handedly determine who wins the game.  Similar to Imperial Settlers, TM has some cards that are good early and some cards that are good late.  But instead of starting with 4 cards and drawing 2 per turn, you start with 10 cards and draw 4 per turn, just keeping that cards that you want to pay for.  I think this extra card draw mitigates the randomness enough to make me happy.

The theme is great.  Some of it is a little wonky (building asteroids and comets), but it is unique and works well.  I love how many different paths there are to victory.  That combined with the wide variety of corporations makes me think the replayability will be very high.  Our first play took about 3 hours, which seemed a bit too long for me.  But if that gets down to more like 2 hours, this game will be a classic.

Update after 1 year and 3 more plays: TM has grown on me.  The play time is still about 3 hours, but that doesn't bother me.  Two of those 3 plays were with the standard rules, and my complaints about randomness of the card draw remained.  But, oh man, drafting makes the game significantly better and I will never go back.

I just love the asymmetry and multiple paths to victory so much.  The decisions and combo building are satisfying.  The mechanics are married to the theme, which is the #1 thing I look for in a game.  I still don't like the "take that" cards, which might be the one thing keeping this game from a 10 for me.  The only reason I'm not buying this is because the only game group that would actually play it already has 3 copies.

When I first played Terraforming Mars, my initial thought was 'hey this is Race for the Galaxy with engine building so better'. However, I'm not sure I still feel that is the case. While I like the layer of added complexity, there is one glaring fault for me in TM, and that is the lack of card control, which in Race is far superior. 

Having said that though, the economics/engine building in this game is superb, I love the awards and the board play. It's very true that this game doesn't have the depth of strategic choices as other great euros, particularly due to the limited card control, but there is enough there to at least keep me interested. Also the solitaire mode in this game is superb, unlike many games where the tacked on solo game falls flat. I prefer to play TM with 1-2 people, perhaps 3 if all players are quick and experienced, as that enhances the milestone/awards grabbing but can be too long with more players (which is odd, considering theoretically it should take the same amount of time to meet game end conditions). 

I have mixed feelings about TM; while it heavily lacks in some areas for me, in others it shines. I need to try the drafting variant, but also, I can't help but wondering how this game could be improved with a Twilight Struggle type card system.

It is amazing to see this game unfold over the generations (rounds) and to watch it explode in the end game. Once you built your engine, every single turn rewards you with the feeling of self-efficiency :D After playing it a little more, I find the combo things going on reaaaally satisfying. While it plays incredibly fast with 5 players, I think I prefer playing it as a 2-3 player game. For now, this is one of my favorites and due to its almost endless replayability, I think this will take a long long time to change.

I found Terraforming Mars to be an interesting, albeit somewhat flawed game. The theme works well, and the three-part end-game condition was works well. There is a constant tension, at least early on, over which cards to pay for and keep because playing cards also costs money, making for some challenging decisions. The production upkeep each round is a little fiddly (and felt a bit like Through the Ages in that respect), but this isn't a fatal flaw. The only real downside is that you are dealt four random cards each round and decide which of those to pay for and keep. However, it is often the case that the new cards you are dealt have no synergies whatsoever with your starring cards (and thus your overall strategy). So, people who are randomly dealt cards that work well with what they happen to be doing are going to thrive, while others may simply stall out due to the luck of the draw. It seems a drafting system that let players see and select from a greater number of cards might have worked better here, at least in terms of competitive balance.

Build your engine by selecting and building the right cards, so a bit like Race for the Galaxy. The action on the map is a bit less obvious but also very important for the score, There are some of these tiny rules bits that you can easily miss, so it is kind of fiddly (e. g. placement rules that affect some tiles but not all mixed with placement rules that affect all tiles). In general, though, the rules are actually simple due to most complexity being in the card texts/ icons. There are one or two rules which are a bit unusual, like funding victory conditions. (It is possible that you fund a victory condition and then someone else wins it, and in each game there is one new player who says, "Oh, that's what you meant" when we calculate the scores).
The decision which cards to keep and in which order to build is always meaningful and hard to make which I like a lot. However, this also means that you concentrate a lot on your hand of cards, re-evaluate them and sort them again and again. The other players do have influence on what you do, it is important to follow which cards they play, but I guess most players till concentrate mainly on their own stuff, so it can be a bit multiplayer solitaireish, despite attack cards and map interaction.

Solo  gäme is also challenging and plays just fine. You can try to beat your score if you win.

It's a good, but very brainy building game with a steep learning curve. Tons and tons of unique cards will overwhelm you in a first game and at what time they fit fit into your plans (or if they fit at all). I really liked the mechanic of offering end game victory point multipliers while at the same time limiting the amount of triggerable multipliers thus creating a race.  There is a (more frantic) race for the milestones. And then there's the somewhat less agitated but riskier race for the awards. Choosing which and how many project cards to take into your hands is also mindboggling. However much I liked the race for the victory point multipliers, the game lost some of its dynamics towards the end. Whereas we really sped up things in the beginning, there was a point in the game when the game lost its dnamics and became somewhat draggy.

One of the best games out there right now, a managementgame that straddles deep and complex strategy while remaining simple enough to learn and play.

This is quite the engine building game. The game relies heavily on cards and the unique actions it possesses. It took awhile before I understood the symbols and how the mechanics work to generate income and manage the resources. After the first couple rounds, the flow of the game was smoother.

My concern for this game is the time frame and it might not be easily taught to mid-weight gamers. It can be prone to AP as well with so many options available. Additionally, the components and the box was subpar at best. 

I still enjoyed it and will rate it higher with more plays. However, I will likely play with players who can handle heavier games.

I love it, and am amazed how easily my 11-year old son beats me with this game -repeatedly. The game most strongly reminds me of race for the galaxy, with players constantly trying to find combinations of cards that leverage each other. Sometimes there is a clear run-away leader, but quite as often there can be changes in leadership during the game, or the likely winner remains hidden until the end of the game. Although the game takes quite a lot of time to play, it's a lot of fun to play, and the gameplay is smooth and relatively easy-going. Finally the game features the prettiest cubes I have ever seen in a boardgame.

Comments based on one play so far: Good fun. There is a nice puzzle here. However, I would have preferred two decks instead of one, pulling out the bigger, more cost-restrictive cards to come out later, and the more engine-building, low-cost cards to come out earlier.

Very interesting and solid engine builder with good variability and cool scientific theme. Card abilities carry the theme well and you can get a lot done and unlike some other engine builders, this seems to run just the right amount of rounds to not only build the engine, but run it, too.

This is one of the games that are hyped and I don't find myself disappointed with at the end! I have also heard some hate that I don't understand much but taking in account the overall rating, most people enjoy playing it as I do. It feels refreshing (the space thematic is not something many euro games do), with interesting management of player board (I like putting my cubes here and there and thinking about cards that can improve my production, contrary to Scythe, where I also had not only one but two player boards and I bored my ass off all game with its stupid system of moving-cubes-that-hide-something to spaces-that-hide-something-else. Terraforming Mars feels satisfying, pretty, engaging and dynamic. I like it a lot, and the huge amount of cards while it seems intimidating the first game, are easily understandable and quite diverse. Well, after some plays you already know them all but they allow quite a few different outcomes depending on who plays them and when.
The only thing I don't like much is the "screw others" type of cards. There is only 4 or 5 of them, which feels like a mechanic that was pasted a bit artificially and often feels forced. Maybe without them the game would be worse, I don't know, but it certainly feels like those cards are so few that they don't belong in the game.

First off, Gametrayz are a must.  Component quality of this game is meh.  Board and tiles are good, cards are okay, but player boards are kinda shite.  

That being said, the game is amazing!  I'm not a fan of the anti player interaction, but I love balancing resources and the mad dash to end the game when it gets close.  Drafting slows the game down, and I'm not entirely sold on it, but drawing blind can give a lot of luck.  Really a good game though, I definitely recommend it!

02.04.17 Drafting, action selection, engine building and tile placement game. Weird art style and player boards are card stock rather than cardboard.

This is probably the most thematically well done engine builder I have played though and I do really enjoy it.  It just cries out for a more premium production.  The components are serviceable enough but the game deserves better.  

They really need press board with indentations badly.  Someone sneezes and the game is effectively going to be played under protest.  Even the improved cube production causes them to all appear chipped and as usual Stronghold's chits always look dingy after punching them out.

But the card interactions are creative and there's tons of them, the theme is shoved into every aspect of the game very well.  The rules are excellently written as well and extremely clear.

I bought this game after one single try.
Awesome under every aspect. The mechanics are many, but the scheme is quite easy to master. The cubes system to count the different resources are so ingenious you end up saying "how didn'tI think about this before???". The game itself is challenging, but meanwhile offers continuously different ways to make points and be somehow able to win in almost any condition. Finally, the flavour is THE BEST EVER. There is not one single card that doesn't feel right. The guys here know what's up.
Everybody buy it now.

Ok, the theme is mega-cool, the huge stack of cards is awesome, and some of the combos you can pull off are insane.

However, it's kindof been done before. Race for the galaxy has the same tableau-hand management feel in a shorter time, and less swingy luck.

So not really sure how often I might end up playing this, while I have both Race and Roll in my collection.

The theme is really cool though..and it plays solo..

There's an awful lot going on in Terraforming Mars. I wasn't blown away by my initial play, but it may have been just poor luck of the draw in trying to form a strategy. My 10 initial cards didn't seem to fit with either of my two corporation choices. I started building an early game strategy but then the well seemed to run dry on the cards I needed (or my opponents were hate drafting hard).

Either way, I can see why people are so high on this title. There are a ton of mechanisms in flight and they all seem to blend well. The variety of cards is absurd but they're explained pretty well (using both iconography and text, which is nice) and don't bog down the game for new players as bad as most games.

I look forward to additional plays.

RATING: 6
TM is far too luck based to be a good strategic euro game and far too long for me to accept the amount of luck it features through the random card draws. Add to this a severious runaway leader problem. For example, if one player gets a good dard combo with the initial draw that allows him to make some easy points he will not only get those points, he will also get more income during the following rounds making it even harder to catch up, through no fault of yours.

As a plus, the game is really easy to grasp. Still, I don't get the hype. Not in the least.

Very good, smooth playing, interesting engine builder. Just falls a bit short of true greatness and settles for very goodness. If only ... playtime were a bit shorter, card combos were a bit more frequent and interesting, spatial gameplay on the map were more meaningful.  I wish for these things but still really enjoy playing the game.  I have some worry about whether it will fade in my opinion over time, but I will get my money’s worth in any case.

RATING: 8
Only played once, so rating might change. The core system is great and offers a lot of fun gameplay. The 'take 1 or 2 actions' rule is very clever.
Our 3 player game took close to 4 hours to complete (corporate era + drafting) which is way too long, even though the downtime wasn't bad at all. I wish there was some builtin progression that forced the game onward, to create more pressure towards terraforming and the endgame. But I only played once so I really have no say in the matter. Apart from that I also don't like the take that effects. I honestly don't think it adds anything. There's enough interaction anyway. 

Update after a couple of more plays:
I enjoy the game but it still feels unnecessarily long. We've played with drafting each round which I actually doubt is a good idea. Drafting is generally a great mechanic, but it works best when there is some uncertainty regarding the other player's strategies. A couple of rounds into the game, it's quite clear which cards you should avoid to pass along. Also, hate drafting comes without a real cost in this game. In other games, hate drafting would cause you give up a card that you could have used yourself, but in TM you rarely buy the cards anyway (typically 0-2 of 4 each round), so it's cheap to hate draft. This leads to the drafting often becoming rather pointless and just time consuming, instead of adding depth. I know the designer prefers the game without drafting, so I guess he knows what he's talking about. Next time I hope to play without drafting.

RATING: 6.7
Decent game, but suffers from randomness.

It's a good concept and definitely fun for a few plays. The game revolves around building cities, greenspace and water on the surface of mars, and building card engines to do these things efficiently.  The game encourages players to build semi-cooperatively by allowing players to score points from one another's constructed tiles, and setting goals that are shared by all players (Increasing temperature, oxygen, creating water, etc).  As more terraforming is completed, more cards and options are unlocked for all players.

As a card-based game, it suffers from a lot of randomness.  Sometimes you'll get stuck because you can't build a good engine, or you're drawing cards that you're unable to play.  Other times you'll get way ahead of everyone else because you hit a few cards that interact really well together.  My biggest gripe with the game was how much luck was involved.  While there are a lot of strategic elements, ultimately you'll have a hard time getting ahead if you don't have a bit of luck on your side.

A solid game, I would play it again for sure, but somehow it just doesn't feel as rewarding as it should.

Terraforming Mars was a game that hit my radar recently. I guess there's been a lot of buzz about it, but I missed all that until a copy showed up in my group. I was immediately intrigued as the game is beautiful and there were many cubes, tons of cards and you're building things. Also, the idea of terraforming Mars is an incredibly appealing theme to me. I almost always love when games incorporate a realistic science element, which this game does well.

While the game has a central board, the heart and soul of the game is the cards. You're drawing cards, buying them and then playing them to do various things in the game. Mostly improving your production capabilities or actually building things on Mars, or just flat out making Mars more Earth-like by increasing the temperature, amount of oxygen in the atmosphere or the amount of water on Mars.

Cards have a monetary cost, sometimes an additional cost or penalty, and sometimes prerequisites that you must meet to play them. Many cards combo off of other things you play. Doing well in this game is going to require that you play cards that synergize well. Almost every card I saw was something that I really wanted and I spent way too much money buying cards only to realize that I just was never going to be able to play them all.

Whenever you do something that actually improves conditions on Mars, you get a bump on the income track (which is also the VP track). There's also cards that get you points. And building cities next to forests gets your points as do your forests.

There's just a lot going on in this game and a great deal to think about. It's definitely a game where it took me the first play to know what anything was worth and what a good strategy should be. And a game where I immediately was looking forward to the next play.

About [thing=167791][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=167791][/thing] is an economic and strategic game about making money while turning Mars into a proper planet to live. It mostly use variable powers, hand management and tile placement as mechanics. The goal is to have the best terraforming rating, which can be achieved in several ways.

[thing=167791][/thing] calls for attention right way, with is thematic board, pretty resource cubes and a stack of cards bigger than the one in [thing=28143][/thing] after some expansions.

The game offers a lot of options and paths to victory, leading a little on a way by the company taken by the player, as they do something better than others, and using this advantage is important, but not determinant or impossible to stray away. And there is a sort of cooperative feel, since increasing temperature and oxygen levels might help others by allowing them to play certain cards.

It also counts with a heavy dose of timming, which, alonside with the amount of available choices and decisions, makes for a learning curve that will take some plays to get around and, due to high random factor of the card draw, will demand constant adjustments and watchful eyes to not lose opportunities.

While the game revolves around making Mars better to receive people, plants and animals, it has, surprisingly to me, some dose of "take that" elements in the cards - usually by lowering resources from the others, be from grabbing money or using their animals to feed your carnivores, and so on. Sure, companies don't tend to play nice with the competition, I get that, but in this sort of strategic game, this does seems, while not out of place nor even unthematic, a bit unnecessary - likely the "best" way the designers found to include more interaction during gameplay, and, if so, pretty weak way to go.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
I will try to surmmize: players start with 20 of terraforming rating. This is also a value of income and doubles as points - the bigger your rating, more money you will get each round and more points you will have.

At the start of the game each player will receive 2 companies and pick one to play. All of them give different starting money, resources, income and/or special ability. At the same time, players will receive 10 cards and must choose which to keep in hand: there is no maximum amount of cards in hand, but retain cards cost $3 per card (once paid, you don't have to pay for them again in later rounds).

At the start of each round, except the first, players will get 4 cards, and will choose which to keep and which to discard. The cost to retain cards is the same: $3 per card (but this is only valid for the new 4 cards drawn).

During the rounds, players can do 1 or 2 actions each turn they have. They can be the same. Some actions are: play cards, use 8 plants to build a Greenery, use 8 heat to increase the temperature, actions in cards, build standard projects, trigger a Milestone, create an Award, and so on.

Some of these actions will allow players to build stuff on the board, usually a Sea, a Greenery or a City, but can also be some special constructions. Seas have proper places on the board, and adding them increases your rating in 1. Greenery must be placed adjacent to a tile you already own, if possible, and increase oxygen level in 1, your rating in 1, 1 point and the end of the game, and $2 for each adjacent Sea tile. City increase your income in 1 (not the same as rating, but both give money), $2 for each adjacent Sea tile and, at the end of the game, will be worth 1 point for each adjacent Greenery. Several places on the board give an reward when a tile is build there: usually plants, but also can give steel, titanium or cards.

Cards will do all sort of things: increase income (be of plants, heat, energy, steel, money or titanium), place tiles, give discounts, new types of actions (as breeding animals, creating beneficial viruses, etc), attack others, and so on.

Many of the actions will cost money. Therefore, build and managing your economy will be key.

The game will end once the oxygen levels reach 14%, temperature hits 8°C (celsius) and all the oceans tiles are on the board.  In the round these three things are true, it will be the final one. After this final round, players will get income and have one last opportunity to build Greeneries. Once this is done, players will score their Greenery and City tiles, and also points coming from Milestones, Awards and cards.

The player with the most terraforming rating (points) will be the winner!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
Wow. So many. To put is simple:
- Which cards to keep (money is used to retain then and also to play them);
- Which cards to use (considering their effetcs, restrictions and cost);
- Where to place tiles (the location is important for gaining a immediate reward, and also for end game scoring purposes);
- Which action to do (timming has some great importance here, as, say that you increased oxygen - this can allow someone else to play a card she wouldn't be able until then; or you build a Greenery and, almost afterward, someone puts a City next by, meaning you just gave 1, 2 or more points to that person; or using a card to steal or reduce the resource of someone else, preventing them from being able to do an action; or advancing temperature or oxygen to the limit, blocking others from gaining rating with their heat or when building Greeneries; and so on).

Though the decision tend to not be overly complex, almost all have lasting effects, be for income or by acting on the board. Money is tight and prioritize is normally the order of the day. Thinking ahead is also required, as is usual to keep cards not only for the current round, but for way down the road, when a restriction for it to be played (like temperature of -4°C or warmer; or 4 science icons; etc) will be achieved.

Sure, there is a lot of tatical play going around here - making the best of that projects (cards) appear is very relevant in doing well in the game, but forethought and preparation can win you the race.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Huge amount of decision points with lasting results;
- The special abilities of the companies era good enough to be taken advantage of but not to corner a player to a single path of development;
- High replay value, as the amount of cards alongside the different companies make for a varied play experience;
- Very good production value;
- Strong theme, present both in the board (the placement of seas and mineral deposits), actions (like purchasing projetcs - cards -, than paying to implant them), effects of cards, and so on;
- Interactive, as players battle for positions of the board and opportunities, both in awards and milestones, but also in the main ways to increase their rating: oxygen and temperature levels.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Luck of the drawn can help or harm one more than others;
- "Take that" cards, which simply I don't think fit properly with everything else in the game;
- As with games with many choices, timming and considerations, some AP can happen and downtime issues can be present.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
I looked across the table, to that silver and coppery cubes, above the Heat space of my opponent, just knowing he could increase temperature. Nay, that he definitely would. But when, goddammit? I look my cards and see my dear Trees - but they require -4°C, only one more step. I do some trivial action and pass - I'm worried, I don't have any more of those left, and I spend too much already, and if I spend on something else, to delay, then I won't have enough for my trees!

Then, when you think, by reading, that you have figure the game out, you learn that the requirements also work the other way around: having maximum of something in order to be allowed to enter play. Sure, there is no way of knowing what cards the others have and what limitations are holding them back. Yet, you do know that, for each step ahead taken, one window might be closed and another might open. And it must be beautiful to look outside a window in Mars. And near the end all this is left behind, as everyone just want to increase their ratings and prevent others from doing the same.

Anyway, it was already mentioned and I add to the chorus: is similar, in feel, to playing [thing=72225][/thing]. You have the same "cooperative end goal while competing" (reduce carbon emission; make Mars livable), and in the process, there is a lot of timming considerations and ponderations. In [thing=72225][/thing] you don't truly want to start a project that someone else will take over, but, sometimes, you will either have to or must to, in order to avoid an early defeat. In [thing=167791][/thing] there is no defeat for everyone (maby in an expansion nearby...), but you want to increase oxygen levels and temperature, as you gain rating with this, which means more money and points - win, win, right? Except that, by doing this, you might allow someone to play a kickass card sooner than later, and reap the benefits for more time. Maybe even a single round gives and edge. 

This is one of the many positive aspects in [thing=167791][/thing], one that brings more color to decision-making and interaction, but hardly the only one. Resources, particularly money, the board state and using opportunities are also there.

There are some oddballs, like the "take that" cards and the AP that all the considerations around your actions might lead ("If I spend this, I won't be able to do this. But this is better now. However, without this, I won't be able to to that later, and if I keep delaying, there is not even a point in holding this damn thing. But, wait, wait, maybe if I place this there, get that $4, I could play this! Yes! Now... wait. I could then build a City...") - it goes with the territory and, while this is player dependent, the game sure doesn't make it easier for the poor sod.

In the end, [thing=167791][/thing] gives a lot for the players, providing a rich environment for development of the companies, many decisions, all wrap up in a very nice presentation. Recommended!

Overhyped multiplayer solitaire with variable player powers. The mor eplayers the more solitaire. Advanced game also makes it more solitaire as it focuses on cards that build your engine instead of the co-creation on the board. After 8 games of it I do not think I'm interested in more than two-player games now. It's okay but for the time put into it there are so many other games I'd rather play.

Rated 7 with two players, 6 with more where the lack of player interaction shines more through.

A glorious mess. My favourite game at Cardboard & Sun 2017, although part of me recognises its many flaws. This game wins hugely on theme, despite many of the components being pretty shonky and the production values across the board veering close to seeming home-produced. This is essentially a sandbox engine-builder, where you have to work with the cards you are dealt, combined with your corporation's abilities, and the ever-changing surface of the planet, to achieve the highest number of victory points. I prefer the game without the drafting variant for two reasons - firstly, drafting adds too much time to an already lengthy game and, secondly, it detracts from part of the puzzle for me - having to work with the cards fate provides. Have played with all possible player numbers, and 3 or 4 seems the sweet spot. Solo play is also fun and a good way to learn the ropes.

The game had some good and bad. We played the advance game (all cards) & drafting. Was long - has a slow start and engine building and then "quick" ending. Various "corporations" and cards can give you unique opportunities or hamper what you want to do - drafting helped this. Nothing earth shattering new but solid game mechanics fitting the theme.

Reminds me somewhat of a more complicated Xenon Profiteer. Were as I think XP ends too quickly as you are building an engine, TM definetely gives you time to setup for long term.

Fantastic game.  Very thematic.  Lots of decisions. What cards to keep, what to discard, when to play....

RATING: 3
First few plays: What a game. Relatively long, your engine goes from nothing to massive over a slow, fun arc. But: if you fall behind, the length and the downtime start to seem eternal, your opponents' turns taking forever and making your situation ever worse. There's a point when you need to concede this game, because playing it out can be like waiting in a doctor's office. I don't see that problem going away. But if this is not a perfect game, it is DEFINITELY a great game, and a lot of fun as long as it stays close.

Couple more plays: yeah, no. It looks and feels like a great game, until we played it enough to see that it's often wildly unbalanced, with amazing downtime, extreme swerves of randomness, and the opposite of fun. Eg, to start the game with Helion vs Cinematix, you have 28 less spending units to start the game. You sit on your hands and watch your opponent take actions. You take 45 minutes just trying to get some production going, because you can't afford anything, and then your opponent spends 1 dollar (earning, as Cinematix, 2 dollars back for the event, so making a profit on playing the card) on a card that robs 7 dollars from you, and you say, oh, now I can't take the action I've been planning for three turns, so you sit on your hands some more while your opponent continues to play. That card cost ONE DOLLAR for the opponent--the cards' costs are NOT balanced to their effects. Really not fun at all. Biggest disappointment I've had in gaming so far.

Gave it a another chance. Game was balanced without any random take-that swings, but the same problems started to come up--VERY long downtime even at 2p, and really just a matter of playing what cards you happen to draw. In this game, we forgot to do the card drafting, and were just taking what we drew. With drafting, it's definitely less luck-driven, but to me, the bottom line is that the overall arc of the game is bad: too long (fix it with a house rule), with the early rounds being much quicker and more fun as you build the beginnings of a strategy, gradually slowing down into a slog in later rounds as you grind through the deck hoping to get good cards.

Two issues with this game: scaling and random card draws:
I played at 2 players because of the way the game comes to a close it is just as long as it would be at higher player counts, possibly longer. As a consequence you wind up doing a lot more stuff as many of the cards have odd rule exceptions and lasting effects it becomes impossible to keep track of everything that you can benefit from in a given round. It becomes as fiddly as the little bronze cubes.
The other issue comes from getting the right cards, this ultimately is an engine building game and so most of the satisfaction in the game should come from building a finely tuned engine which is just starting to hum as the game ends. The problem is with this you could build an engine and never get any fuel. People complain about the random card draws in Imperial Settlers, I know that a bad hand at the start can really hamper you but ultimately there are always things to do with those cards because they truly are multi-use here your options are: don't buy the card, pay to trigger it's effect or buy it and give up later costing you 2 money. The cards not being multi-use isn't the problem here it's the fact that the randomness of the draw prevents you from planning for the future and building an engine in an engine building game, and in a game of this length I really should have more say over the route I take, it shouldn't just be 3 hours of trying to do the best with the cards I have now. All that said I hope that the drafting variant will mitigate this and when I play again I will definitely try it but: I fear it will add to the length of the game which will only add to the problems it already has. Perhaps one thing they could have considered is making you move up the tracks quicker in a 2 player game.

This game is so extremely satisfying to play. 
Being able to gradually expand your empire and customize your strengths while planning for short term and long term goals is very rewarding. 
The card play is enriched by the resource management and production manipulation; having to think "I could pay for this expensive card now and reap the rewards, but if I sit back and first play these other three cards, then in 2 turns it will all be much cheaper"
Over the course of the game your engine builds into a strong and versatile machine and every production phase feels like christmas.
The interaction with other players will vary greatly depending on whether you play with the Corporate Era cards, but at all times it felt very balanced. It can be cruel to steal / destroy other players resources, but it's only a minor setback and it never takes someone out of the race. 

Now, about the two primary ways to play:

Standard Game
Much shorter than Corporate Era and in fact falls in line with what is written on the box. This version of the game feels very smooth and there is lots of tension as people push the global parameters around much faster, which puts pressure on all aspects of play. The Standard Game has a lot more significant player interaction and jockeying, and the focus is very much on the surface of mars. It is, in my opinion, the definitive version.

Corporate Era
As you probably know, in the box are the Corporate Era cards and variable method of play. This style of game is much longer and has players really build their engines from scratch. It is a much more cerebral and insular style of game, where players will sit and stare at their own tableau and play-area rather than at the board of Mars. The player interaction, while more aggressive and (possibly) frequent, is not as interesting as the Standard Game, as there is so much more room and time to rebuild anything lost / stolen. The global parameters will go up and you will not so much as bat an eye-lid unless it's the final one or two spots.

Of the two styles of play, I prefer the feeling of building my engine with the Corporate Era cards and variant setup, because it is more deliberate and controlled. You really feel as though you built that company up from scratch and it satisfies.
The Standard Game, though, would have to be my favourite method of play, not just because it fits into a reasonable time-frame, but because it's really all about the terraforming and the board-state. Everything you do contributes more immediately to your goals and strategies. 

The bad?
Sure, it doesn't get 10/10 for me and I'll let you know why, but please understand that despite the following, this game should be on your shelf if you like Strategy, Science, Card-play, Resource Management and Engine Building.

I hate the player boards. They utterly fail to deliver an appealing look and feel. Everyone has said it, so I won't go on about it, I will be finding a suitable solution for this mess as soon as I can but it seriously detracts from the experience. BUT. It has to be said that this negativity melts away as SOON as you start playing. The game really is good enough to distract you from this.
It is a bad thing but it can be fixed. 

There is only one other thing that lowered the score of the game for me...

Between the different player counts that this game supports (2 up to 5) the feeling, strategy, play-style and evolution of play is wildly different. Because the global parameters remain the same throughout the player counts, a 2 player game will see roughly the same amount of cards played as a 5 player game, but the distribution (as you can tell) is different. In 4 and 5 players you will only just be getting your engine up and running, technically, when the game ends, compared to 2-3 players where your engine will be purring like a kitten as you cross the finish line. 
This disparity isn't really a negative thing, but for me it loses merit in the overall experience of the game because the game is SUCH a good experience and having to adjust that within the amount of players doesn't so much feel like "replayabilty". It could be said that this adds depth to the way you can play and that you must be versatile but I disagree. My experience of the game will vary depending on the amount of players which adds unnecessary complexity to the explanation and anticipation of play. The consistency of the experience falters and it must be noted. 

In any case, at least give it a try, ESPECIALLY if someone has custom player mats ;)

Thanks for reading.

Ever since Race For The Galaxy, I am a big fan of tableaubuilders. As such, I was really looking foward to trying out Terraforming Mars. And my first game was a delight, but I felt a little bit disappointed at the same time. Halfway through the game, I realized I was really enjoying the game, even though I missed a little bit of the interaction of Race. The second half of the game, as your options dwindle and the game goes into its third hour, I unfortunately felt my involvement decrease. Choosing the right cards is the biggest appeal of the game, and the discovery of combos is quite exhilarating. Adding to that is the interesting theme and the fantastic look of it all using the Broken Token inserts and gimmicks. However, it slowly became less interesting for me to follow the actions of others, which seldomly affected me. Also, I am not particularly fond of the race to reach achievements, which also kept me from loving that other buzzed game, Terra Mystica. All in all, I definitely want to play this game again, but do not feel the need to own it yet.

I can understand where the hype is coming from as much as I can see why TM will not be a cup of tea for everyone. The game uses card drafting to build a personal tableau of powers for engine building and scoring. There is a spatial element on the central board where players compete to place cities, form oceans or add greenery tiles. I would contend that this board is a minor element of the game. Where there is competition for spots, in general, you can place the tiles and get a few points. Therefore, if you are not a card drafting fan, this game is not going to pull at your strings. That said, the card iconology is not complicated and the text on most of the cards are superbly written.

Like most card drafting games, TM suffers from low player interaction. Each turn as players go through their motion, I have no clue what they are activating or triggering. It becomes impossible to voice out every action. Subsequently, late in the game, everyone just goes through their turns quietly doing what they do or mumbling their actions as others try to listen in. The map does present some interaction but these interactions are relatively passive as there is nothing can be done to interrupt or alter placement of tiles on the board. One just has to anticipate.

TM is highly rated for a reason. The card drafting mechanism is married beautifully with the theme of terraforming mars. I felt that each card I played altered the mars landscape and there is a rush between companies to produce a habitable planet. It's too bad that each player is so busy with their own individual tableau that a more complete story arc never develops. 

Lengthwise, the basic game fits within the mid-heavy weight category and slots in nicely as the main course for the evening. It should be noted somewhere in the booklet that the basic largely ignore steel and titanium as a resource.

I've only played this once, so maybe it gets better after multiple plays, but my first impression was that it was just really, really............. ordinary. Like, I'm sure I've played a game just like it, or almost like it before somewhere. Maybe I've played several games just like it and forgotten all of them! 
An engine to build, a board to put stuff on, several score tracks, most things you do are card-driven, not too much interaction but just a little..... yup, this is a euro allright. Just about the only mechanic I hadn't seen before is where you have to pay $3 for each card you want to keep in your hand, which makes for some tough choices if you have a really useful card but cant play it for a few rounds due to one of the tracks not being high enough yet. 
With 3 players the game was also about at its limit for tolerable downtime. I would not want to play with the full 5!
So it's fine I guess. I can take it or leave it. I'll be fine playing it when others want to, but for me it's yet another Euro to chuck onto the pile of other forgettable Euro's I've played. So the next time I'm staring at a hand of cards, along with a board with several progress tracks on it I'll be saying to myself "I'm sure I've played this somewhere before......"

the rarest thing - a eurogame exploding with theme! this game almost feels like a science simulation.  cards, actions and events make thematic sense and not like some arbitrary game effect or mechanic just placed for the sake of complexity.
does not feel like mechanical puzzle. lots of meaningful choices. havent played much yet, but from what ive seen doesnt seem to be some optimal path to victory. 
nice variable player powers that dont hamstring you into playing specific strategies to win.
good amount of direct conflict and randomness that adds to it being fresh and interesting every game.

1st impression. SU&SD nail another review. I'm struggling to see what the fuss is here. There is not much game - it's more about playing some cards and telling a story. It looks like a heavy euro, but none of the decisions are difficult - the game basically plays itself and you, as a player, just watch it unfold while you keep the books up to date. I also find the talk around the drafting variant fascinating. People seem to claim it reduces the randomness, but drafting only four cards in a four or five player game doesn't reduce the randomness at all. The cards are very easy to order, and that order is unlikely to vary between skilled players. Really, you might as well just deal em out and save 30 mins. Initially I thought this was a more elaborate 7 Wonders, but the drafting in 7 Wonders is much more agonising and therefore impactful.

Richly thematic, and an amazing number of cards. On the flipside some components are of substandard quality. The game screams for a "deluxe" version.

I also enjoy how the game itself is open to very simple mods (drafting in particular) that add in strategy without amping up the playtime that I could imagine. It'll be interesting to see how folks work with the system itself.

RATING: 6
There's a great game in here, but it's buried under lots of luck and bad incentives.

The actual planet board tends is decentralized as everyone focused on engine building. It's unfortunate that the gameplay as promised: "Terraform Mars" is really different than the game you actually play: "build an efficient corporation". It's definitely enjoyable, but I wouldn't recommend it to most players.

Many of the resources are not mechanically different from each other other than that they are essentially "special money" and there are many corporations that make them "slightly better special money".

Unfortunately, the game is really luck based without the drafting variant, but drafting significantly slows down the game. I would play with the drafting anyway, as it's worth the extra time.

Side comment: Truly horrendous graphic design and art direction. Whoever thought "red square on brown background" was a good idea to represent "an opponent loses one production"? The art is a bizarre mishmash of bad photoshops, real pictures, and generic art.

A little hesitant in rating this 10 because analyzing the game it is a 9 at most but my feelings shout 10 because this is the most fun I've had in a game in a while. It's a game where I feel the sense of accomplishment and it also seems very variable with widely different strategies and tactical choices emerging every game depending on card draws and also all of these being somewhat viable. No two games are likely to be identical. Extra credit for a very tight integration with theme. Despite having randomness in card draw I feel that this has a race for the galaxy-like feel in that skill really matters more than dumb luck. Basically you have to make the most out of the hand you're dealt. It's also easy to teach and easy streamlined rules.

Rated an 8.4? I guess I expected too much. It's fun and the theme is cool. But the player interaction is almost non-existent. You can form a strategy, but at the end of the day you have to play what you draw. Then you wait until it's your turn. You don't form alliances, trade, or attack. You can plan how to spend your MegaCredits and that's it. On a positive note it does plays relatively fast. And its easy to teach, except people never understand the milestones and awards. Nor do they know how to place cities or forests. So you win every first game.

RATING: 4
After 2 plays you realize the game always goes the same way.  There is NO variety really when there is really only one winning strategy aka forests and cities.  The corporation cards actually make the game worse as you get pigeonholed into using specific cards which reduces the options even further.  There is nothing left to make me want to come back

Come on, people! This is hardly "fifth best game of all time" good. It's literally just a euro game with a theme, plus it can outstay its welcome long early due to there being no predetermined number of rounds. I once played a 2 hour 45 minute 2-player game with my friend, all because we couldn't pass up on playing cards to set up our engine and forsook terraforming for the longest time. I do enjoy a game of TM but the length makes it hard to pull out more than once a month.

I don't like game with a lot of cards and small text (except for the american ones) and I don't like Terraforming Mars too, a mashed up between race for the galaxy and terra mistica. And when i see a lot of cards I always think about impacts they have on the game, and seem that the impact is not that much , so another game where your control of the game is more passive than active, where you decision about the card to keep or not is not that influent on the whole game process.
But if you like cards game and map position mechanism probably you like this.

Ridiculously overrated.

Bad rule-book, inconsistent components with some being good and others terrible. Way to long for what it needs to be, extremely random and frustrating with the card draw, even longer if you use the draft variant to mitigate luck in the draw.

The card combinations are so obvious that the game basically plays itself and there is little satisfaction in building up your engine.

Solo is.... okay.  I like it, but I almost wish there was more of an active AI.  Racing against a timer is still way better than just a "beat your score" mechanic, though.  I really don't like "beat your score" solo modes.

There is a lot to like in this game. Soo many different cards and cool effects. The theme really shines through, and it feels scientific. This is my biggest positive impression of the game and I will always enjoy playing it because of this.

Now I really like this game, but I have some negative points about it I want to state:
- The tile laying part of the game feels underdeveloped (I would have loved if they did something more with this part of the game)
- There is a little to much randomness in the card draw, some people can get lucky and get their production up early, while others will lack behind until the right cards come to them. 
- Because of the point over there can be a runaway leader problem. 
- The engine building in this game tends to be a little slow for my tastes, and the game and go on long with 3-4 people.

I still really enjoy playing this game, even solo! Will be interesting to see what the upcoming expansions will do for the game

Terraforming Mars is an engine building/economic snowball game that's driven by a huge deck of unique cards with lots of information on them. I generally dislike both engine-builders and CDGs so a game that combines the two was never going to be my cup of tea. Race for the Galaxy strikes me as doing whatever TM is trying to do much better in 1/6 of the time- not only do you get to see a LOT more cards in RftG but if you get hosed you can always play again in 20 mins. I played a second time to give it a fair shake (and won, for those who might think my comment is sour grapes), and just found the experience boring as hell. Even my friends who like it admit that Terraforming Mars is too long for what it is.

Easily among my top 3 for now (right after Essen 16). The game feels really long, but in a good way "wow, I wonder how many hours we have played, I was doing so much stuff" instead of the rather usual bad long "oh my god, three hours and still haven't done anything useful". Easy to teach and hard to master, the cards offer great theme and a good variable gameplay. Drafting is a must as you have many more options and are not as dependant on the card draw. Components are fine. Buy it now!

I know this comes with a big board, lots of tiles, and a bunch of plastic cubes but trust me, this is not a Euro game. It lies completely on the card game side of the hobby. Everything you do is based on card interactions and most people play with a drafting variant, that reinforces the CCG/TCG feeling even more. The deck provides an incredible amount of variety, as every single card in the 200+ count deck is unique. They all have very cool effects as well, each feeling both powerful and thematically appropriate to the title and illustrations.

This is one of those games that just make you feel smarter playing it, which is why I think so many people love it. The board and tile placement rules are fairly constricting, so I wonder if it will still have legs after a dozen or so plays, but for now...it is certainly one of the year's best.

Solo play is poor. You necessarily miss out on much of the game, and to win you must ignore even more of it. Maybe worth a couple plays to figure it out.

It doesn't work particularly well at two, either. The take-that cards, which are unfortunately needed for balance, are much less reliable with only one target. The board is too large. And the last few rounds are clumsy and anti-climactic, both because there are only two players responsible for all three terraforming goals and for how unwieldy the tableaus can get.

In general, the game feels under-developed. Some synergies are better than others, with many victory point engines falling short even with the larger number of turns in a two player game. There are many dead draws throughout the game. Key strategies and effects are often represented by only a few cards making them unreliable, which is made worse by the limited card draw effects. There are not enough counters to plant production. I would have much preferred additional ways to generate oxygen to the anti-plant take-that cards.

Still oddly compelling. The award mechanic is excellent. And while the components were terrible, I very much enjoyed the theme. A game I kept wanting to play despite its flaws. Although I can see that changing.

RATING: 9
Interesting game. Love the huge variety of cards. Sure, there's a lot of minor variations on a theme, but I love that everything has its own wrinkle. Overlays seem like a nice idea given the slipperiness of the mats, but it's already expensive. (I opted for the boardgameboost overlays on etsy; indulgent but they seem nice.)

My biggest concern is how much luck is present. You have to make some bets, and even if the odds are good, they can fail to pay off. Or you can get massive windfalls, just whim of the deck. I don't think the draft is the right solution (so slow/tedious), but rather the cards should have been staged (2, maybe 3 tiers). In a game with such obvious feedback loops, fast starts are a little too key.

Still, really cool game, great variety of play, and what a fantastic and well-implemented theme.

RATING: 8
Great game, a number of different pathways to victory. It's an interesting combination of competitive and cooperative play (you all work together to make Mars habitable, but are also trying to outmanoeuvre each other with your engine building and planetary development). To those critical of the game taking way too long to play, you may have made the mistake the we did (apparently its fairly common), ensure you are facilitating the 'generations' properly, you don't just get 1-2 actions each turn, in succession you keep taking 1-2 actions until everyone has passed (makes a HUGE difference). On the downside the player mats (and board) are pretty flimsy and the marker tokens can be easily bumped around (potentially causing issues deeper into the game when its tough to remember where everything was). Would happily pay for a pricer edition aimed at a higher quality product (firmer player boards with ridged trenching for markers would be great). The variety of cards is compelling, but as some have pointed out, it can take a few plays to figure out how they connect and draft, and some seem a little overpowered.

Would recommend utilizing the 'draft' option with cards, otherwise you can (and will) find yourself benefitting from, or falling victim the luck factor with some receiving too many over-powered cards which can unbalance things.

RATING: 3
There is some fun combos and engine building here, but the game is very long and totally solitaire, except for the tacked on milestones and awards, and the agressive cards, and some passive-agressive plays on the map. So it's not solitaire then? Yes it is, you will look up once every 20 minutes from your way too big tableau of cards and curse at your mean opponents whose birds ate your plants. Every time I play a game like this I feel like the designer just didn't give a shit. This is my gut feeling, not an objective assessment mind you. Agression just feels easy to design. Which surprises me because we played without agression, and the game was still suprisingly balanced, and also, thematically it would just make more sense to have some friendly competition instead of bombing each other with meteors.

Fantastic game, I just love the huge variety of cards and asymmetrical starting powers. The core rules are pretty simple, but the game is full of meaty decisions, especially when you include the corporate era cards (once you try them out there's no going back, I will never play with just the basic set of cards again). This has to be one of the most thematic euros out there.

The only real drawback I can think of is the length of the game, I wish it was a little shorter as it can overstay its welcome after 2,5 hours of intensive play (you should be able to cut the playing time by 30 minutes once you master the game though).

[b]/update, January 2018:[/b] Downgraded from 9 to 8. It's just too long for what it is, Race for the Galaxy offers even deeper engine building experience in 30 minutes so it's hard for me to get Terraforming Mars to the table these days - there's always something else to play when I have 2+ hours. Don't get me wrong, I still think it's a very good game and I enjoy playing it, but when I play something that long I need a game that offers a bit more player interaction to keep me involved throughout the entire thing.

I don't mind the luck of the draw as much as most people seem to. (no, I will NEVER play the draft variant unless I know all other players are fast.)

The game feels somewhat incomplete, because there is no way to control the luck of the draw. I hope future expansions include the card draft system similar to Through the Ages.

Oddly none of our group of four gamers visiting Essen wanted to purchase it. The premise was fine for me. I just won't buy a game that looks like this game does, with it's budget production, especially given its publisher's means to do better for the price tag. The artwork is dreadful and the components are cereal packet quality. It plays fine. I wouldn't wish to teach friends to draft Terraforming Mars off the bat unless they were my old Magic The Gathering team mates.

RATING: 8
The best way I can describe Terraforming Mars is it's Race for the Galaxy, but much longer. Instead of playing in 30 minutes, it takes two hours, but in those two hours there's a lot more going on. You're building up your engine and working in a different direction from the other players.

That being said, I'm not wild about it. It's fun and mechanically interesting, but after playing it twice, I'm not finding myself really wanting to play it as much as other games.

This is a thematic take on resource management. My biggest problem with it is that many of the cards involve stealing from other players, which is a huge no-no in my groups. I can still play it solitaire, but I find I still have issues with the way the resources are tracked. I would VASTLY prefer to have custom resource bits, as in games like Imperial Settlers or At the Gates of Loyang. The metallic cube counters that come with Terraforming Mars look pretty, but tracking six different resources with them just doesn't work well.

I've only played the game once, so consider this a first impression. First, let's talk about the good. Mechanically, this game is a finished product and fun to play. The replayability is very high, because you start each game with a different company and with different cards, which push your strategy towards a certain direction in the beginning. This means you are forced to adjust for every single game. Now, the bad. I'm most concerned with the component quality. The box itself is very thin and fragile, and people are saying 90% of the inlays are torn upon opening the box. The resource cubes have a thin metallic coating which wears down after just one or two plays (especially the smallest, bronze cubes). Not what you'd expect from Stronghold Games and from such an expensive game. Before considering to purchase it, I will wait for a possible second edition with components that are up to standard.

Exactly as the title describes.  Increase oxygen and temperature on Mars where it will sustain basic life and become habitable.  Tile laying on Mars surface and hand management of multi-use project cards--over 200.  The heart and distinctive play lie in the adaptive strategy decisions based on how the other players are changing the planet coupled with the expertise and timing of utilizing the project cards.  Lots of combinations playing off of different situations to explore.

I like this game but it has its issues. 

The game is unique and plays differently owing to the plethora of cards. How they come out affects how one's attempt to transform Mars occurs. 

The placement of city tiles if you can get them out, as well as greenery tiles is important. Placing near the water reservoirs is important for extra Mega Credits, but is not necessary. I would say that the right hand of the board should maybe have a little more water. I saw someone rack up lots of points by starting a greenery area away from water and expanding from there. If I were to tinker with this game, I' might have the players designate the areas where water might be placed. 

The Milestones and Awards are cool ways to win victory points and I like the three out of five limit. They are not to be ignored. The game really seems to pick up speed as it progresses and one develops their company's strengths/strategy. 

The game could use a little more interaction between players. To note, one player said to me during the game he felt as if you are playing against yourself. There are some cards that allow this, but they are mostly cards which have you screw over the other players. This does not bother me. There probably should be  more cutthroatness in this game. The research phase where you draw cards has an advanced rule for passing cards to other players, but this is really the only other interaction. While this prevents the game from being a 9, it does not take away from the game too much. The reason why the lack of interaction does not kill the game is due to the fact that a player spends much of their time focusing on what they are going to do and what their opponents are doing themselves. Therefore, the down time is not too great/long if other players know how the game works. 

Nonetheless, more player interaction would have made this game stellar. Maybe they can create an add on to this game and tinker with the rules to include more interactivity to make it Advanced Terraforming Mars. A gambling mechanic for earth investment to gain more Megacredits, stealing cards, an industrial sabotage feature, or a mechanic to bid or block hostile takeovers of owner tiles or empty tiles on the board, in order to represent company risk reward efforts, so as to increase player interaction would be a cool feature, The danger with this suggestion might be that it would affect the balance of the game which is quite good as it is. It might be too late to make any changes. 

After more playing I 'd like to offer an observation here concerning teaching the game as well as finding people who will enjoy the game. The game is about the cards. You must play this game with someone who can focus on the cards. Too many times people do not read the cards carefully and they struggle because for some reason or another they cannot concentrate on the cards. One person I played with did not like the game because he struggled with interpreting the cards and their tags which was clearly explained to him. Another player, I played with took to the game with ease, never needing explanation owing to the fact that eh too the time to read each one. So my observation is that you must play with people who are willing to concentrate.

One other note I have after several plays now is that this game is very fiddly on the player board. Keeping the cubes in line on your production track is a little tricky as moving cube resources to and from the bank. For instance, because I knocked my player board my electricity production went down. I thought I had two electricity but had only one marked. I could not remember if I had two or one. It was not until I remembered that I paid to raise my electricity one step during a standard action that I reminded my other players that is occurred. Same thing happened with my Mega Credits as well. I had 10 + MC, but knocked my board and could not remember if I had 7, 8, or 9. The player boards could use an upgrade so that they are dishes for the production tiles or cut out holes for cubes to be inserted into for player production. I realize that this would be a costly addition, but since they already have fancy cubes and the fact that this game could have been a near 10, the extra cost would have been worth it in my opinion. As the saying goes, you get what you pay for.

This makes the game a 7.5, but not quite the epic 9 or 10. After two plays my other friend said it dropped down for him from an 8.5 to a 7.5. I concur with him after even another play. To me it is getting way more hype than it deserves, but oh watch out if you criticize it among its devotees. I will never put up a review again.

Bad artwork and a non-existing theme.
Random cards that have to decide your strategy, interaction is only with the tiles or I'll steal-some-of-your-stuff cards. Felt long and samey.
IF you like Argicola (me don't like) and Le Havre (me likes), then you might want to check this out. However Le Havre is just a better tableau building game. This game just doesn't grab me, and it didn't feel as fun.

Very well-themed and playable.  Having only one or two actions a turn keeps things moving.  The drafting variant is quite playable and doesn't seem to add much length for the control it gives the players.  There seem to be a lot of ways to win.  A bit of take-that style interaction will bother those who prefer multi-player solitaire.

I highly anticipated this game, thought I would adore it.  And while I do enjoy it enough, the multi-player version of this game becomes a slog later on and is just multi-player solitaire, which can be ok, but I didn't enjoy this game's version of it.  The solitaire version is truly great (and difficult!) however.  Would probably have this as a 6 if not for the solitaire version.

This game plays really slow. Not to be confused with long (which is can be, but that's not an issue)... just really slow, a lot of down time. While the mechanics work well, the production is great, and the theme is there, it's a very anti climatic game. You do things, and do things, then do some more things... someone is obviously in an uncatchable lead... you do more things and it's over. If I had to play this game with 5 people I would probably sit the game out instead. It's a fine game, but I don't understand all the awards it earned.

Great game, though 5 players makes the game a bit too quick (in turn count), and 2-3 players drags the turn count up (which significantly changes card balance).

What a doozy! Played once and it was so much to think about. A bit overwhelming for someone who doesn't play a lot of Euros like myself. It's rather long and I had no idea how to get an engine going. I think it needs multiple plays to really shine. 

I'd try it again but I can't say that I'm itching to.

RATING: 9
This is one of the best engine-building games I've played. The theme is nicely integrated into the gameplay, and the designers did a good job of making the cards feel really cool.  There's very few cards in the HUGE deck that make me go "meh, I guess I'll do this lame thing just because".  Usually it's "OH SNAP. I'm gonna channel this lunar beam to do cool things!" That's awesome. Unfortunately, the components are lacking. The art on the cards is inconsistent -- some appears to be actual art, some seems to be borrowed from stock art, and yet some others are real life photographs. It's kinda weird. I had a hard time with the rulebook - even though it's on the short side for a medium-weight Euro, I don't like the way it was structured. Player mats really need an overlay to keep cubes in place.

The hype from 2016, but a great game. Graphics are a bit on the medium side, but what it lacks in eye candy it has tons of in gameplay.

Several ways to victory and great combo possibilities

What a masterpiece!  This is one of those games that you play and play and it makes you want to reevaluate how you rate your entire collection.  The engine building, card chaining, resource acquisition, milestones, board play, race elements all combine together seamlessly into and incredibly engaging, fun design.  A euro that drips with theme and allows the time to pass by without you even noticing.

The ONLY thing that can sometimes stink in the game is when your opponent has outplayed you so well and you know you are going to lose but have to go through the motions towards the end of the game.

Bought it based on the hype/scarcity. After a couple plays and the completely random draws you receive and unable to work toward my personal goals, and having to do what the cards dictate I'm not sure why people like this game so much. I'd rather play Race for the Galaxy. I really wanted to like this and I'll give it another try, but I think it's too long for what it is. I could play race for the galaxy 4 times in this play time and have had a lot more fun.

RATING: 8.5
Some really agonising choices to make every turn in the balance of strategic vs tactical prioritisation. I would prefer to play with drafting once I have the opportunity to play with experienced players. I have some concerns about the random nature of the opening 10 cards coupled with the corporation synergies, sometimes a player can get handed a huge leg-up while another has a weak opening position by random chance. If an experienced player has an opening advantage it may go a long way to deciding the outcome of a game that is by no means short. I need to play more before I can determine whether these concerns are legitimate or not.

Holy cow! What a great game! I'm really impressed when a euro-style game can give you a narrative. The game is built on a very solid skeleton of gaming mechanisms. The real surprise is the story that unfolds as you play the game. My tree-hugging corporation opened the game by nuking the surface to generate more heat, but still managed to get sponsorship from Greenpeace right before I built the new Greenpeace Space Elevator. Okay, so we may have added some flavor bits in there, but it made so much thematic sense regardless. Turns were quick despite clocking in a little shy of two hours for my first game.

RATING: 9.1
Love this game more with every play despite the fact that it plays long (and I always lose to Katya). The sense of progression both in your corporation's tableau and on the board is very thematic.

The amount of interaction/take that is good. Not completely multiplayer solitaire but the "take that" event cards have their place in slowing down the other players progress as needed. 

Huge replay value given the number of cards.

RATING: 8
Good game, with some poor components, and weird development choices, but a terrific theme. The gameplay is fun, and engaging. I look forward to exploring it more. I'm concerned that the card draws may affect the outcome a bit too much, even with the drafting version, but only more plays will tell. The graphic design is overall good, but some of the artwork choices are plain poor. I don't like how they mix photographs, and drawings on the game's cards.

This could easily go up, or down in rating, but for now I like the idea of the game, and it's a solid eight.

I'm not fond of this game. I don't like random action cards. Terraforming Mars is all about the cards. Play this action card to buy more action cards later. And then cooperatively terraform Mars to make the game end. Please, make the game end. Finally if you played the most optimum action cards and cooperated the best, you win. It's far from the worst game, but nothing I get excited to play.

I've realized that I don't enjoy the drafting mechanic in longer games where it feels like your entire game is at risk with no room to fix mistakes.  I have no issue with it in Sushi Go!, and less of an issue with it in 7 Wonders, but Terraforming Mars presents too many options and I quickly fall into analysis paralysis.

I love the theme and resource engine building of Terraforming Mars.  I didn't like how dependent everything is on that very random card deck.  If you are lucky you form a long term strategy and the cards you draw support it.  If you are not you can end up buying a lot of useless cards while you try to change tack to follow whatever strategies the cards give you.  I enjoyed it enough to play again if offered, and would like to try it with a card draft to see if that helps mitigate the card draw luck a little... but there are other games in this weight class with more control that I prefer.

OK. I've now played this at least 15 times with 3 different groups. It is an unbelievably fantastic game. The last game our groups played this many times in this short a time period was Pandemic Legacy: Season 1! 

Two of us have now ordered our own copies both to save our friend's copy but also because we're now curious about solo play. 

We've played it with 3, 4 and 5 and it works great at each. It takes 3-3.5 hours to play, but the time just sails by. No complaints.

--------

Played it twice on Monday. Excellent game. Looking forward to playing it again. Both games were utterly different, which totally surprised us. We played 3 player and all of us agreed 3 player may be the sweet spot. We've put this onto our "3 player game" list.

The only downside is the component quality. The player boards were flimsy so I laminated them. And we only had 2 sets of the player aids, which is weird to us as why not have 5 and why not on a single sheet instead of 4 cards? Just weird.

I can see why people are hoping for an updated edition with better player cards, etc. However, we all liked the art on the cards. We'd definitely leave that alone.

Terraforming Mars is seriously one of the best games I've played. It's certainly not my favorite, but I think that it's quite an interesting game. It's slightly advanced for novice gamers, but for someone like me who's more advanced, it's a breeze and always fun to play. One of the best aspects of the game is that you can play it either solitaire or collaborate with multiple players. Although when you play with more than one person you collaborate throughout the game with them, you have to keep in mind that scoring in the end will determine a winner, therefore your greatest allies can also be your greatest opponents. Great game, y'all should definitely check it out.

An ok game but it left me feeling : is this all there is to it? It has one half with a very simple card mechanism and another half with tactically putting tiles down. 
Luck in getting the right cards in your hand made it feel rather railroaded. Though this might be partially solved by drafting. 
I found the strategies to be very one sided, while the choices are more tactical. Either you get a chain of the right cards during research or you don't and play laying the tiles and pay hard cash to do that. 

Card design is very one sided too. Most cards are just one effect green cards. The red cards while having a big one time bonus, feel very weak when targeting other players and they seem to target plants in particular. Very weak interactive elements. Blue cards with a recurring action are the most interesting though the actions are mostly bland. 

Also every card only exists once in the game, this leads to more randomness. 

We found a 'problem' with the heat VP goal, where if one choses it early , other players will stock up on it too, not helping to raise temperature. 
 
Very expensive game with components that aren't of great quality. Aweful resource board and cubes show wear quickly. 

The solo game is really boring. Lacks human opponents that block you with tiles and doesn't have the tension from the race for achievements and VP goals. 

Yet, great and awesome theme and game translates this rather well because you can easily imagine what's happening by what's on the cards. (The artwork looks a clumsy and awkward though). Thematically it is still very weird to have researched something that other players can then never use.

This game is great for what it is. As a tableau building game it has more player interaction than most, and it is not all interaction by dick moves. To be sure, dick moves are there, but there is also competition for awards and achievements and tactical placing of tiles to block opponents or gain points from opponent's tiles. In closing, if you are looking to buy a Stronghold game buy Great Western Trail first, then buy this game.

Great theme, it's fun to build your little terraforming enterprise. Basic game is a viable way to play, it's quicker and gets going faster. Corporate game seems to have swingier luck, with significantly more cards in the deck. You are often at the mercy of the cards you draw. Often it's a matter of getting a certain critical mass of cards that combo well, or getting the right cards at the right time. The deck is huge, so randomness will play a part.

UPDATE: 25 plays as of writing this; it's a popular one, stirs the imagination (especially if you like science-y things) and the cards you look at are always suggesting various plays and plans. Definitely play with the optional drafting rules, since it evens things out for some corporations/strategies that require seeing particular types of cards, and moderates the luck factor.

I liked the expansion maps for the new milestones and awards, and Venus Next adds some variation but nothing huge.

2017 KS is offering a beautiful set of components at a great price with free shipping to the US and a metal coin option. However, the game play is not appealing to me, auctions turn me off and imply no true solo experience possible. So it goes on the "don't buy" list. Which stinks, as I like the theme and love the components!

Not a terrible game, but also nothing to write home about.  Played 4P and two people got 8 settlements down.  But in the end, I found it to be too light and I'd rather play something a bit heavier.

Nice filler game. More complex than Karuba, but still very short, a game takes around 30-40 minutes. Gameplay is very smooth and interactive. You have to plan ahead, in some sense is also a race game with tactics, where you have to watch your opponents' steps. Basically you produce stuff and then you build it (if you can)

RATING: 4.5
Very light and bland worker placement, resource collection/conversion, race to get the most hexagons on the board. It features multiple colored meeples with specialized roles, but since getting them is determined by a wheel of fortune, it feels tacked on. There are enough mechanisms built in to get what you want anyway, it only matters if you get things before your opponent does.

The game features pretty wooden pieces and visually it's a nice production, but Montana doesn't add anything worthwhile to the board game spectrum. Easily forgettable.

RATING: 6.5
A decent little worker-placement race game that takes less than 40 minutes with two players. The "diminishing returns" of the WP spots are well-designed, especially since (in a race game) time is more important than resource efficiency: though you get more for your money in the first spots, the later ones are better for getting multiple goods all at a time (for a much higher price).  I'm not sure what the spinner contributes to the gameplay, apart from being a gimmick, but decisions are interesting enough for us to keep this around as a filler for now.

RATING: 4
While there was nothing bad about it, Montana also felt like a rather soulless game. You place dudes worker placement-style in order to gain resources. You then use the resources to place your tiles on a hex board full of spaces that require various combinations of resources to build on. First to place all their tiles wins.

This all "works", but everything is super bland and vanilla. All of the spaces to build on are more or less equivalent. You don't really feel like you're doing anything clever, just slowly plodding along, gathering resources until you use them to put down one of your generic tiles on the generic board.

In this vein of "race to get the things done" games, I really enjoyed Oracle of Delphi far better recently, as it gives you many different goals to shoot for in a much more fun efficiency puzzle. Here, you just feel like you're doing the same thing over and over.

RATING: 6.8
Neat little accessible, race game that plays OK with 2. (Im hoping for better results at higher player counts). The game is missing the proverbial 'pop' that really sets itself apart from other such games. The game features a spinning worker wheel which feels odd and out of place. Not sure why they didn't just throw in a drawstring bag so players could randomly select two workers and then pay one grain to change one worker. Ah well, in the end its a decent game but feels like a missed opportunity and probably doesn't have much staying power in the collection other than the designers name. Definitely try it before you buy it.

A highly optimised game with lovely bits of collecting workers, then resources, then spending them on land claims. There really isn't much to the game save playing as efficient as you can, and trying to derail opponents in various ways. There isn't an action with which you can 'attack' another, so in practice it will have to be grabbing land first thus making the land placement for your opponent slightly less efficient.

I can't really find a major fault with this game... save for perhaps that it is all so... bland.

Another fine & fluid game from Dorn. He never ceases to amaze me with his designs, even though I've probably outgrew him.

Fan racing game, plays really fast (usually close to 30'), top notch production, theme is all over the place, some resource management but mainly a game heavily relied on timing.

Good stuff even if you try to avoid racing games such as myself!

This game is nothing special. I had fun playing it and will probably play it again.
The gameplay is definitely lacking in depth.  Simply hoard heaps of resources, then go off with a really big turn with a building action.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A surprisingly fast game with a lot of different elements which work together seamlessly. 

The main element is the worker placement part where you gather resources by spending workers and money. It's interesting how the workers do not go of the board until certain parts have been filled up. This makes timing very important in the game.

This is also true for the bidding element. Bidding can only be done with the pumpkin resource and can be triggered by anyone. So keeping an eye on the pumpkin supply of other players is important.

But then in the tile placement part of the game it is also important to time your actions well and to be able to spot the good areas. It's important to plan ahead and keep an aye on what other players are doing.

The art and production quality are great. The rules are simple enough that it could be played with the family and even a 4 player game plays fast. Great stuff.

RATING: 7.5
Betrachtet man die einzelnen Spielelemente ganz oberflächlich, dann bleibt MONTANA eines der vielen x-beliebigen Werke seines Jahrgangs, die man spielen, aber genauso gut liegen lassen kann. Ja, es ist trotz einem meines Kindheits-Lieblingsthema Western ein themenbefreites Spiel und, ja, es ist ein Euro und dazu auch noch ein straight forward entworfenes Worker Placement einfacher Machart. Und dennoch hat MONTANA aus einem liebevolleren Blickwinkel seinen Überraschungscharme. Denn hinter dem Cowboy-Einsetz-Mechanismus ist MONTANA eigentlich ein Wettrennspiel, was zumindest den Planwagen westwärts auf dem Cover eine inhaltliche Existenzberechtigung verleiht. Zudem ist MONTANA ein ziemlich schnelles Rennspiel, sozusagen ein Euro Race Game: mit Getreide, Kürbis, Stein und Kupfer werden hier neue Siedlungen im Wilden Westen gebaut. Und Geschwindigkeit lässt sich in MONTANA sogar als taktisches Element und als Reiz des Spiels erfahren - vom kontinuierlichen Siedlungsbau Runde für Runde bishin zu einer abwartenden, lauernden, ansammelnden Haltung, die in eine explosionsartige Expansion von Siedlungsketten mündet, was sich dann plötzlich doch noch thematisch mit der raschen Besiedelung der neuen Welt deckt, die über die unberührte Natur aus Hexfeldern hereinbricht. Und eh man sich versieht ist der halbe Landstrich besiedelt und das Spiel ist schon aus und vorbei. Vor allem damals für die Indianer, deren Leben zwar hier nicht auftaucht, sich aber dann im rothäutigen Blutsbruder WENDAKE themenergänzend nachspielen lässt. MONTANA, hier im schönen Lookout-Look von White Goblin, ist ein Fast-Feel-Good-Game, das sich so zügig spielt, dass es in der leidigen Kategorie der Absacker als Euro-Variante zu einer echten Option wird, weil es das Überflüssige im Absacker aufhebt. Und das Arbeiter-Beschaffungs-Wetterrad ist so verblüffend einfallslos und frech, dass es schon wieder gut ist. Auch die formgebenden Holzkomponenten aus billigem China-Basalt-Holz finden hier lobende Erwähnung. MONTANA ist eine versteckte Glasperle, die zwar keinen Preis für Originalität bekommt, aber dafür eine eigene, kleine Schönheit hat. MONTANA, das Glasperlenspiel der Spiel 17.

Fine but very generic light game. I don't call it a family game, as this won't get played by familys for different reasons. It looks interesting and complex, but it's very straight foward and plain boring.

Get ressources to build your tiles. Once you are out of tiles, the game ends, wohoo...

Refreshingly fast playing game with a spinner to vary worker collection.  Snappy gameplay, with turns lasting seconds.  Several resources to collect and convert into homesteads.

Rüdiger Dorn lately seems to have a knack for combining familiar mechanisms in nice undtraditional way. This is a faster Istanbul, less to think about, more racing feeling. Whether that's a good or bad thing is up to players.
But the idea of winning your workers in a "roulette" and sending them for a single-use task... is intriguing at least.

Flows well enough, but this is a lot of clutter and setup for a relatively simple 30-minute affair. I'd like to play more, but it seems like the key consideration is watching your opponents like a hawk and then taking (subpar) moves to build 1-2 tiles before they can slap down theirs. Not bad, but the setup suggests something deeper than you get.

Well, this was all sorts of disappointing. Too procedural, too trite and not enough interesting decision points. It's hard to know who this was targetted at - it's not long enough, thematic enough or charming enough to appeal to virtually any genre of gamers that I know. The short playing time is one of few redeeming features.

[b]Montana[/b] was sold via the marketplace 1/14/2018. 

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6/8):[/COLOR]

[i]Montana is a fast playing race game that ends once one player builds all of their settlements onto the public landscape board [i](which is made up of different tiles, adding some variety to the game)[/i]. If only one person built all their settlements they win, if not there are a series of tiebreakers. Montana uses worker placement as the mechanism to gather gold and the other resources [i](pumpkins, wheat, copper and ore)[/i] you'll need to build your settlements. A spinner is used to determine which color workers you get; the color determines which resources those workers can gather. Believe it or not the spinner works quite well and adds a fun, tactile element to the game.

Montana is very tactical; you have to watch what your opponent(s) are doing and react accordingly. This is not multiplayer solitaire, if you spend too much time navel gazing you will get trounced. Quite simply you need to be more efficient than your opponents. All this adds up to a relatively straight forward game that is easy to teach and quick to play. Your enjoyment of Montana will depend heavily on your feelings towards the race element and a potentially abrupt ending to the game; with four players it's much harder to pay attention to what everyone is doing and react accordingly. Montana is deceptively light, I think some gamers will go into this expecting a much heavier experience and walk away disappointed once they realize just how light Montana is.

Personally I'm enjoying my plays, but long term I'm not sure how the race to the finish will sit with me. On the plus side not only is Montana quick, it also plays great with two.[/i]

This is a smart, fun, quick playing game which is about picking a plan and executing it as efficiently as possible while doing anything you can to throw a spanner in the works for your opponents and hoping they don't do the same to you! If you dither or delay in Montana, you might find you get thumped so you have to be on it right from the off through to the finish, which comes round with surprising speed. My taste is usually more for heavier, longer, slower burning fare but this is a terrific option to have when I fancy something fast playing but with meaty decisions that I can get done in 45 mins or so.

Solid euro game to manage and convert resources into other resources. You are racing to place your tents down faster than any other player and whomever can do that quickly enough wins!

Even though it shares nothing in common with Istanbul, it reminds me of that game in that: it's fast - plays in < 1 hour, turns are quick, and if someone takes a spot you wanted you can pivot quickly and find another way to do what you need to do to win. Both games I've played so far have been decided by 1-2 turns, as in 'I would have won on the next turn!' Excellent game overall.

They also started publishing more and more original titles. Those have been very hit and miss with me. Their highest rated game is [thing=42452][/thing]. That is a good game, but it's not amazing. They also have a bunch of stinkers ([thing=66251][/thing] anyone?). So I'm always willing to give their games a shot, but I'm always weary that it might turn out to be complete rubbish. Of course, when a name like [person=381][/person] is on the box, I do have more hope.
Anyways....
This is kind of a WP game, but you don't need to place workers for all actions. Also, there is a good flexibility in placing them in case you don't have the colors you want/need.
You're essentially gathering resources and using those to claim terrain. The players who claim enough terrain (10 hexes) trigger the game end. There are some nice bonuses and a nifty auction mechanism thrown in for good measure. These things to elevate the game above your average gain-resources-score-points thing.
Oh yeah, the way you get new workers is by spinning a spinner, you know, like in all those shitty kids games. I didn't find this to be a big problem though. You can have good and bad luck with it of course, but the game gives you enough flexibility that this is not a game breaker.

Received from Essen 2017. A fast and interesting that everyone could play. Timing is decisive and I like the fact that there is no need to count VP at the end to know who won. A drawback would be that it looks complex but it is really not. Replayability is fine.

The game went quickly, but I just wasn't interested in what we were doing. I am not big on tile-layers and the resource gathering to place tiles didn't make it better.

Montana is an interesting little worker-placement and building game that works well and presents some tough choices for players. Just not my style of game, though. Whether it's racing to build on a choice spot first or the overall goal of racing to build your camps first, this style of game always feels unsatisfying to me. I like the whole mechanic of having to recruit your workers before using them, though, and hope this mechanic shows up in some future game that isn't predicated on a race to the finish.

I don't really see any appeal here - there's no possibility of any planning and nothing very interesting happens.

Update Jan.2018: after five 2p-plays we give up. The auction doesn’t work with two so in the end it’s the luck of the spinner which decides pretty much who has the better chances of winning. Most of the choices are too obvious and the huge amount of (nice looking) wooden pieces is ridiculous. Blocking is the main interaction in both the worker placement and on the board. Many times it seems more important to block the other player than to build up. In the end we just didn’t have fun. 

I sold Montana while it’s still hot, but wouldn’t mind to play again, albeit with three or four players only. 

Update Dec.2017: somehow it doesn’t work as well with two as it does with three players. Played twice 2p so maybe we simply missed a decent strategy. 

Fast! Bright colors! First impression: glad to have it. Looking forward to 2p experience (one game in, 3p).

Tested it at Spiel '17 in Essen. It was an instant buy for us. Played it at home one day later and still like it very much.

It plays faster than any other worker placement game in its league (that I know of) and feels a lot like a race. Rules can be explained pretty fast.

A quick race to place all your tiles on the board. Not really any engine building, but tactical move optimization. Rules were a bit unclear after first reading, but actions are really simple.

So it has a spinner.  Big deal.  Quit your whining.  Gotta like Dorn games.

This is an excellent game that should take no more than 45 minutes. The race to settle everything first plays very smoothly and creates some fun decisions that can fit in an evening just after dinner. There are not enough games of this caliber that fit that description.

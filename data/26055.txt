RATING: 7.8
Very good epic space empire game.  A mix of war and politics.  I haven't played it since I played TI3, but I still miss the fighting and the battles present in 2nd ed. (not very much fighting in TI3). These rules are also easier to pick up than 3rd ed.

My rating for it has dropped in the face of the 3rd edition, which has lessened my desire to play this one.

RATING: 6
Very crowd-dependent, mostly because of the play-length and prickliness that can surface when your shiny, new dreadnaught gets blown up by a single die roll. And if your co-players are abrasive or otherwise obnoxious then this can be an experience that starts to rate on a "pain scale" rather than a "BGG rating scale."

Before 3rd edition, this was a 9. After 3rd edition, this is still a 9 and 3rd edition is a mangled, unplayable 2 (would be a one, but you can use the bigger hexes for TI2, maybe). 

In this game, the multiplayer dynamic truly shines. It's long and meaty and complex and every game is a different challenge due to the political phase.

So good.

RATING: 6
The second edition was okay; I didn't dislike it, but it didn't thrill me. However, I'm very much looking forward to playing the third edition. The Eurogame-influenced turn mechanics with the strategy cards sound much more interesting. Also, in TI2 everyone's goal is the same: to acquire a certain number of planets, technologies, and resources. My understanding of TI3 is that not only does every player have a secret private goal that will give them points, but the winning condition is based on victory points, and there are numerous ways to acquire them, so you can utilize different strategies, including a non-military one. Sounds a little like Antike in that way. In the TI2 game that I played, four of the five players had to resort to military attacks in order to increase their number of controlled planets; they had no other chances at victory.

I was not impressed. My reservations after experiencing this version of the game made me very skeptical about the Third Edition. The "turtling" phenominon affected this game badly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
House rules and Fleet Stacking signs used to hold the overview in my TI2 galaxy. Shortened game with common, not hidden victory conditions and one choosen & controled planet-colony outside your Homesystem at start. Hidden fleet strenght, Shock Troops, neutral forces and diplomatic state phase (Allied-Friend-Neutral-Crisis-War).

Played in 2011 TI3 with 6 players with mixed strategy cards in 7 hours. Tough game, in which i was knocked down after 4 hours as Xxcha by an unlucky battle against the Letnevs. Don´t really like TI3 for its play-length.

RATING: 8
This game was a 10 until 3rd Edition came along.

I believe that the politics in this game are better than those in 3rd, but otherwise, 3rd is the superior game.

I would still play this without reservation.

OLD COMMENTS:  My favorite game of this type - period.  I will NEVER turn down a six-player game.  This game may have it all:  Strategic military combat, exploration and expansion, modular game board (assembled through player choice!), meaningful technology trees, clean rules, and (my favorite aspect by far) a satisfying political component!  PBEM suitability is a big plus.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
[20/12/06] I guess TI is the definitive space opera game. A good design encompassing politics, diplomacy, r&d, military and economic affairs. My main beef with the game's that wars tend to be too often WWI-style attritional affairs, frequently leaving it up to a third initially uninvolved party to sweep up the pieces... Nonetheless, tremendous space-romping fun. Hope to play the newer 3rd ed. some day.

Long multiplayer space empire game. It has a great diplomacy phase where a political issue must be voted on each turn, which often polarizes people into new rivalries every few turns! Uninspired fleet combat is the game's weakness. Also, suffers from typical free-for-all whinefest diplomacy. Play Dune instead.

I haven't played TI3 and as yet don't feel the need to rush out and lay down the wonga.

This game could be accused of being risk in space. I actually like the fact that it doesn't have any euro mechanics in it. You produce monies buy ships and research techs, and fight each other with dice. There are some political cards and a few other bits of chrome but its pretty simple and a stand up fight. Takes about 4-6 hours.

I wish i could play it more but it tends to loose out to A Game of Thrones in my group.

Played 3 times.  Organized specific sessions for this game and never completely finished any of them.  Really need a laptop to do some of the calculations quickly and there are some good programs for it.  Reward for agressiveness isn't as high as it should be.  Had fun when I've played it, but hard to find time to play.

As with the 3rd edition, this game would get a higher rating if it weren't so long. Of course it's a moot point now; the 3rd edition is so much better that I'll never play this one again.

RATING: 6
Fairly standard multiplayer conflict game, with all that entails, like long playtime and typical bash-the-leader incidents as well as fairly large swings of fortune in a short amount of time. I'm not a huge fan of the genre but as far as those games go TI felt like a good enough contender. It's much less complicated than I expected.

An extremely good game with diplomacy, economy, and of course battles.  Each race has advantages, the board is set up with hexes so it's different every time.  There is no outer border though so buy a piece of plexiglass to place ontop of the board to keep the planets from moving.  One of my favorite.

Some good ideas, but too much bookeeping.  It was a good game at the time.  Fleets get way too large, and richer players can simply steam roll everyone else, or the political cards screw them over by destroying all their dreadnoughts...

I like the second edition much better than the third.  The third seems to take longer and play is slower because instead of players doing more at the same time you have to wait for someone else to initiate actions that in the second you could have done already.

RATING: N/A
This is really the superior edition of Twilight Imperium in terms of rules (not components).  Build up your fleet, research tech, expand to local systems and then go for Metacol Rex in a series of massive battles for the center of the board.  I wish this rewarded aggression throughout the game a bit more (ala Nexus Ops), but it's one of the best 4X offerings beaten out only by the vaunted Nexus Ops itself.

RATING: 6
I liked this when it was fairly new, but it had a few problems that typically comes with complexity, of which there was a fair bit. The Third Edition that came out a few years later was a big improvement, so would probably perfer to play that, since I have that as well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I really enjoyed how the distinctive parts of this game - researching technology, voting in the Senate - are a part of the turn order rather dependent on the Strategy cards (as they are in 3rd edition). This game seems more oriented to military conquest.

2nd edition.  Plastic pieces are too fragile.  Game players have strong incentives for "turtling".  Will need to try this out a few more times to decide if it is a keeper.

This one was always fun.  It was a pain remembering the tech tree counters and I know that 3rd edition is superior.  Still, we need to break this out again one of these days.  Sometimes the progression is Amoeba Wars as an appetizer and then TI as the main course.

RATING: 8
I really had a blast when I played this game.  I wish I were able to play more often.  In general, I love boards with variable set-ups, as well as varying player powers.  I also like all of the balancing that must be done in this game.  Concentrate too much on exploration, you open yourself up to attack.  Same if you go out in conquest.  You need to have some influence as well as some stuff from the tech tree.  Balance, balance, balance.  Then keep an eye on your opponents as well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is by far one of the better wargames I have played although TI3 is much better. I almost gave it a lower rating because it takes so long to play. But, with the addition of the Manifest Destiny rule, allowing carriers to invade twice per turn, giving all players an additional 10 credits and allowing them to place units directly on the board during their first turn... the game can sometimes be one or two hours shorter, but we are still talking about a 5-6 hour game!  This of course assumes a majority of players have played it before. The balance between politics/diplomacy, random action cards and Distant Sun counters, technology and warfare are interesting.

A nice design that encompasses a lot of ideas: diplomacy, exploration, combat, planning/building, technology upgrades.  The voting phase is especially good.  Only two bad things, in my mind: an uninspired combat system, and it's way too long.

Apparently the new edition didn't improve the latter, or did so only by the irritating 2 VP ISC (which I wouldn't use), so this is just one of those games that sounds nice in theory but is too unwieldy to actually play with normal people.

Well, it didn't sound like much 'fun' when the rules were described, but actually I really enjoyed playing.  I am assured that with more players it is more frantic (the grabbing of the machines before other people can and subsequent regret) and thus more fun.
You have to have a decent spacial awareness to do well at this game.  Others could have big problems picking the right machine and then serious problems fitting it into your factory.  On this basis I would suggest it is a terrible game for women, kids and old people.

fun speed game, extremely thinky though.  It certainly holds up very nicely against galaxy trucker/mondo but its kind of stuck straddling the speedy and thinky worlds in a way that doesn't gel together perfectly (not sure if any game does).

Perplexing puzzles... I didn't get what was going on in the beginning, and once I realized my mistakes it was too hard to catch up. The puzzle aspect is interesting, the game moves quickly, but ultimately it's not my type of game. I would definitely play again though, as I want to see if I can improve my score.

Original puzzle style game that tests some peculiar skills, which by the way I haven't got. It is worth giving a try just to know what it feels like bearing in mind different parameters (space for machinery, color, intensity, connections) in order to make a kind of puzzle.

A plus for me is that you can play on your own if you want, but it is practically a solo game even when playing with other people.

RATING: 9
During a recent game of this, I came to realize how much I enjoy the simple challenge of setting up and achieving the output combos.  It's fun to build your factory, and it's fun to snag the piece you need in time without grabbing one that you can't use.  Bumping this up to an 8 from the initial 7.

Update:  Bumping this up to 9 because it continues to be fun every time it gets pulled out, with whatever number of players we have.  It always draws a crowd when it gets played over lunch.  I feel like I'm always up for a game of this, even when I don't feel like gaming.

Been wanting to try this for some time.  Glad I did, but I don't think it's my thing.  There's a big spatial-budgeting thing going on, and grabbing the right factory quickly seems very important.  It was hard to get over the feeling that the first turn or so could make or break the game.

A puzzle game.  You route colors from sources to inputs in order to power your machines.  Competitive, but very friendly.  I enjoyed it, though it's not one I'm looking to own or play often.  Would play again.  Give it a shot if you like friendly puzzle games.

I really don't enjoy puzzles, so I was quite surprised to find myself liking this multi-player one.  The theme of producing ever-more complex networks of machines and pipes sucking in and pumping out goo is surprisingly engaging.  The initial grab for machines at the start of every turn can be quite tense, with a hasty decision often proving costly.  The building and re-building of networks can require lateral thinking.  Despite feeling no need to own Factory Fun, I've never refused a game of it. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Although I do like puzzle games and I do certainly not dislike Factory Fun, I miss something in this game. Maybe it is a certain amount of tension or competitiveness. 

Besides it's not easy to see, who is on the lead, since you count the 'contact lenses' in the end. You have to check everyones board regularly. Furthermore the time pressure aspect when selecting machines is not in the spirit of the game. I would like to take time to think things out. And at least everybody is doing his thing, so there isn't much player interaction, but that can be fine when you are not in a talkative mood.

However I appreciate its basic concept and idea.

My enthusiasm for this one has waned a bit. It has much going for it: the rules are simple and it's easy to play and explain. Player interaction is extremely limited, though, and play really boils down to a series of spatial and network optimizations.

A quick game of iteratively improving a flow network.  The quick-grabbing phase of the game is more sedate than it first appears, as you really need to do a quick feasibility analysis before picking up a tile.  This is an excellent light game.

The downsides: It feels a bit lucky with two, as one of the machines turned up is often much better than the other; and it can take hours if played with people who are not good at solving the combinatorial puzzles regarding how to place machines.

This game was completely off my radar but I had a great time with it. There is a speed element where everyone flips a tile simultaneously and you have to grab the one you want the quickest; I really didn't like that aspect. I had thought that I would hate it, but its a small enough part of the game that it didn't drag it too far down. Still, it would be great if there was something more strategic that could be done rather than speed. After that the game turns into a really fun puzzle, probably the most puzzle'y game I've played so far. That's what pushed it over the edge to make it onto my wishlist. Would definitely recommend trying if you like puzzles.

One of the best puzzle games available.  Game play is super quick and game length is perfect.  Each turn, players flip up factory machines and race to decide if they can utilize it in their factory layout.  Do not be weary of the speed element - it simple ensures that the players are quick about deciding if they should take the machine - not how quickly can they play it into their factory.  Points are scored for placing the machine efficiently and substantial bonus points for feeding one machine's output into another's input.  It is this placement that is the critical element of the game.  One of the few games that almost always ends with 'let's play that again' - a statement that is repeated usually several times before the game is put away.  If you like puzzles or connection style games - this is a must.

Problem with this game is that all players need to be on equal ground with regards to spatial arrangement skills or else this becomes a game where the winner is unchallenged bored and those without this skill rather frustrated and bored. 

Unfortunately, I always won and this game became very boring.

Wow! There is a competitive aspect as you try to grab the tile that is the best, but after that it can become very cooperative as you try to optimize each factory floor.  I like the puzzle solving aspect to this game.  Many would find this boring because it is too analytical or because there is not more player interaction.  This is a game that plays great solitaire.  Some folks have concerns that it would be too easy to learn how to otpimize, but there are so many factories that this is not a real concern. 

I showed this to a friend who actually laid out a factory floor.  He thought it was a hoot.  He's vowed to play with a former coworker because they designed the factory together and had a lot of arguments about what the layout should be like.

The key to high scores is optimizing the number of outputs feeding into other machines.  Plays well with 2 and 4, haven't tried 3, but should be similar.

See my comments about the Cwali edition.  The Z-man edition adds some nice ergonomics, values in the center, trimmed corners, pipes sized to their values and ability to play with 5.  However I really really like the artwork on the Cwali edition and prefer that version.  There are three things that I prefer with the Cwali version: 1) the box size even though it's hard to get all the pieces in the box.  This edition is about 3x larger. 2) The artwork is brighter and more whimsical. 3) The bonus markers are clear plastic rather than cardboard numbers

RATING: 8
Really good game for the time it takes to play.

Of note, this is a nearly fully simultaneous multiplayer game.  Players take the bulk of their turns at the same time.  This means, like 7 Wonders, it scales very well with player count.  The downside in this case is that the interaction is seemingly low, although the tile grab injects a lot more interactively than you might think.

Hence, while quantitatively it is almost a multi-solitaire game, qualitatively it does not feel that way at all.

The game itself feels and plays like what I would like a Lego based game to feel like.  I really like it.

RATING: 7.5
Fun Factory has a similar feel to Friedemann Freise's Flickwork, with the inputs and outputs added on, and to Ricochet Robots.  With the published rules it was more frustrating than fun.  The quick draw method of selecting the machines was out of character with the puzzle aspect of creating the production networks.  Each round produced an unseemly grab based on one criteria - usually output (as there is not time to assess output, input, price and bonus vats), as a pause for consideration would mean that you were simply left with the machine that nobody else wanted.  This was followed by much angst as you try to achieve the impossible task of connecting the various inputs and outputs economically - analysis paralysis on every turn!

Notwithstanding the above, the game is quite clever.  After one playing with three we were sufficiently enthused to play again - but with more sedate rules, befitting our middle aged gamer status!  So in game two we changed the machine selection process as follows.  Players start on 20, not 1.  The start player (decide any way) takes a start player marker and then bids zero or more for one of the machines.  Bidding is clockwise.  Each bid must be higher than the previous bid.  If you drop out of the bidding you cannot re-enter.  Highest bid takes the machine and that player's score is adjusted down accordingly (unless the successful bid was zero).  The next bid is started by the next player clockwise.  A player can only win one bid per round and oncethey are successful can start placing their machine immediately.  The person left with the last machine still has the option to decline the machine.  The result was hugely satisfactory.  There was time to asses the machines and to bid accordingly.  Consequently you mostly you ended up with the machines you wanted and a processing network that could much more easily be pieced together.  Ironically, despite the added length of bidding process, the game turn played much quicker as the networking was easier - and consequently more fun.

The five multiplier bonus for matching inputs and outputs appeared spot on, and in both games so far was key to determining the winner.  The machine names were a nice touch - 'Cwality 06' - witty.  My 7.5 rating is based on the variant which I would happily play again.  I would not play again with the published machine selection rules.

The best part of Factory Fun is the satisfaction and regret of your previous decisions. One moment you'll want to give yourself a high-five because you were able place a machine tile in your factory with total efficacy, but the next round you'll regret the very existence of that tile because it prevents you from fitting a another machine into your factory.

In the end this game is a big puzzle that I really enjoy solving with my wife at the end of a day.

Phased scramble to collect machines for your factory seems to have been the inspiration for Galaxy Trucker (FF was there first). A nice mechanic with the need for quick thinking to grab the right bit and then to incorporate it into an efficient factory floor. 

Needs a timer to avoid excessive AP but all in all a solid little filler. I look forward to the release of the expansion.

Rating up'd to 7.5 but think its maybe worth and 8.

I have been wanting to play this for a long, long time and the wait was worth it.  The first game was very confusing but tying to figure out how to layout your factory floor as efficiently as possible.  But by game two I finally realized that you need to maximize machine to machine connections in order to win the game.  Plus the timing factor of who ever picks up the piece the fastest gets it really adds a fun, though stressful element to it.

Played my first 3 games back to back to back!! This game is just addictive. I love the puzzle element of trying to fit all of your machines onto your floor. Definitely a keeper! Further notes: The solitaire game is fantastic! I do the variation I saw here where you do 2 stacks of 10 machines, flip the top machine of each stack over, and try to put only one of them into your factory. The other machine goes into a pile. You add up the machines in the pile and are trying to beat that score. I am 1 for 7 so far, it's tough! But soooooo much fun.

Ouch, this game hurt.  Here's the thing, I knew going in to this game, that it was a puzzle game, and I like puzzle games.  And I thought this game stunk.

Which is fine, except that placing new machines is hard, way too hard for such a simplistic game.

Simple and moderately enjoyable, Factory Fun ensures chaos and frustration every time you grab a machine, only to realize at once you can’t stick it anywhere in your shed if not by changing its setup completely: this also helps make a good play (i.e. that perfect placing) much more rewarding though.

As a whole, Factory Fun works as a filler: actually, it’s nothing more than a good filler, if only a bit too long.

Now this is a great game. Mind you there is very little player interaction but if you like optimisation puzzles with a hefty dose of risk management, this is the game for you.
One interesting observation, in our normally competitive group you will often find players helping each other out with a particularly hard to place tile - its about the challenge, not the winning with this one.

Had very low expectations when I purchased this game...  I only grabbed it because it was on sale at Tanga.

I would consider this game to be a hidden gem. WELL worth the money.  I would happily pay full price for this game.

VERY fun and wreaks havoc on people prone to AP, which would be my wife haha!  LOVE this game!  There's just something satisfying about connecting the machines.  We also love the wide variety of machines provided.  Each player board is different and double sided which is very cool.

The components are top notch.  The box is HEAVY, filled to the brim with gaming goodness.

An okay multiplayer solitaire, tile placement puzzle game with the potential for serious AP (long turns) and an annoying speed mechanic (simultaneous machine/tile grab) that kills the game for me. This could/would be better as an auction.  The machine you get in the simultaneous machine/tile grab is critical and can make or break the game for you, (especially near the end) so I think it would be better to auction off the machine (Evo style auction). Overall, I really want to like this game like because I enjoy the puzzling aspect, but the machine/tile grab and long turns to fix screw ups tend to suck the fun out of this game. Note to self: instead of directly connecting a supply pool to a machine, try adding an unnecessary pipe in between that could later be upgraded to a "T" or "plus" in order to supply other machines. This avoids having a supply tile surrounded by machines and losing the ability to use that color.

Good puzzle game.  Definitely more fun than my rating lets on, but I just always choose other games to pull out when I go to pick a game to play.  I think I don't like the competition to grab a good machine... Even though I try to take my turns quickly in most games I play, I tend to make bad decisions when time pressured like this.  Weird.

I can see why some people like it - I don't, I loathe it in fact. I'm not sure why - I'm not totally against multiplayer solo games. I think it's the timing mechanism, you have a mad 'grab a bit' mechanic where you snatch the next gizmo for your factory as fast as you can, and then the game sinks into a stupor while everyone then tries to maximise the placement of said gizmo in their factory. End result dull, dull, dull - you're just solving a personal puzzle, with a mad scramble at the beginning of each turn. For 'puzzle' type games I'd rather play Take-it Easy, for multi-solo games again many others I'd rather play. Theme doesn't help much either. Definitely no 'Fun' in this game for me :(

--- Update, got talked into playing it again (against my better judgement), ugh ... still loathe it, dropped the rating to a 2, as I'm really not playing this again. I can see why some people love it, I don't.

Quick, fun, tense game.  It's basically a multi-player solitaire where the only interaction comes in grabbing a tile before someone else can.  still, the puzzle is very interesting as you try to place and connect machines to earn positive points (which is harder than it sounds).

Rating based on multiple plays.  Fun game, not too heavy.  Definitely multi-player solitaire -- more of an optimization puzzle, but I usually like those.  AP players can bog down the game, but it usually isn't too bad.

EDIT: Upping rating from an 8 to an 8.5 because it still hits the table regularly and usually gets multiple plays in a row when it does.

[b]Puzzle optimization:[/b] A friend rightly made fun of me for owning a game which so blatantly declares its relationship to work. But what can I say? It's fun to try to get the machines to work together. At least on the right day. CD is not a fan of the speed-grabbing, and I think we both wish there was some way to work competitively on a common factory floor, but this works for now.

It took me a few plays to warm to this placement and orientation game. If you like games such as Roborally you will like this one too. Figuring out the intricate weavings of pipes, machines and sources is a bit of a brain burn but it's a "good" burn. Now that it's been re-released and not so impossible to get a set I would recommend it. A medium game in terms of length but heavy in terms of mental effort.

I love puzzle games!  This game is pure fun.  Your first game should be seen as just a warm up while you get the hang of things.  The selection is fast ( I really suck at that part) and then you have fun trying to make it all fit.  The scoring seems secondary to the amount of fun that is had, and even losing I was having a great time.

This game is like crack.  I've had this in my sights for a long time, but once I heard of the reprint, I decided to wait.  And it was well worth it, as the production quality on this one is superb.  This is a game that stands up to many plays, and it will get played often.  I consider this more of a toy than a game almost, as it is mostly about puzzling out the most efficient routes within your factory.  Almost everything is allowed... if you can pay for it.  The rare game that is fun no matter how good or bad you're doing.  Highly recommended.

I like how light this game is while being incredibly tricky at the same time. I am not crazy about the "grab the machine you want first" mechanic, and all too often there is a mad scramble for machines that no one knows they even want. Unfortunately this is the only aspect of the game that involves player interaction. I'm wondering if some sort of bidding or turn order mechanic could be introduced that would make it less chaotic.

Better than expected.  I'd definitely play again.  I was surprised at how quickly it played, and the amount of AP wasn't too high.  Once again, the lack of interaction really stands out and almost makes this one a multiplayer "puzzle" game.

The Z-Man edition is good, but the original is better!

This is a great game, especially for double geeks (game & computer). Just flat out puzzly-fun. When we play often we help each other try and fit machines, which is not a normal reaction for a non-cooperative game.

I stopped logging plays a long while ago. I have easily played this game over 100 times by now and don't foresee my pace slacking. I'm not a "chess player" type... I rarely want to play a game two times in a row. I'm not the type to want to play again until I've mastered it (at that point it loses its allure). This is the lone exception.

Played this a slew of times recently with a brand new gaming addict (who loves it as much as I do). I'm still enamored with this game. It's addictive!

Factory Fun is just good, clean, fun. It's not a serious game, it's not heavy, but it is fun. It's like a bunch of interesting mini-puzzles that you get to work out, sort of like Take it Easy, a game which it reminds me a lot of even though it is mechanically quite different. Sometimes you want to grab an opportunity when it comes up, sometimes it's about finding some way to place a new machine without totally hosing yourself. I played this and Space Dealer back-to-back, and they are both games where the final scoring is almost immaterial. You do the best you can, and you try to win, but the fun is in the process, in figuring out all the little problems the game throws at you, not in the actual winning or losing.

Because of all this I'm not sure Factory Fun is a long-term keeper - Take it Easy, despite being a great game, also burned itself out pretty quickly for me - but I really enjoyed all of my first 3 plays. If not a long-term keeper (update: it's not - I sold my copy), it's still definitely a short-term winner.

Man, the title is a really good description of the game!  You're building a factory and it's fun!

The game is fairly tense, as it's essentially a speed grab to get the factory piece you want.  However, grab too fast and you may discover you didn't think things through well enough!  Too slow, and you risk the piece you really needed getting grabbed out from under you.

Often times, it can be rather brain burny figuring out how to best shoehorn in your newly acquired equipment.  Really, my only complaint is figuring out how much money your builds cost.  Essentially, every time you move or add anything to your factory, it costs money, and you often do quite a bit of shuffling around.  I had a bit of a problem remembering what I had done on a given turn, especially since you often do quite a bit of moving of pieces to find an optimal solution.  I hope it didn't result in too much unintentional cheating, but clerical errors are definitely a big possibility here.

Other than that, I found it really fun and challenging assembling a working factory that efficiently churns out points to win the game.  Even when it doesn't work out, it's fun just to laugh at how terribly things turned out.  Good stuff!

RATING: 8.75
So far only based on inital play.  Loved it! Absolutely loved it!  Being that the rules are quite limited it nearly feels like an abstract puzzle game but with great theme and component quality (Z-Man). My word of wisdom?  Take your time with choosing your machine at the begining of each round. Most of the members of my group just mad crabbed them and I usually end up with the only one left. But being that I only took one if it benefitted me in the short and long term, I was able to win due to a certain amount of luck here and there as well as due to the loss of points my opponents had due to just take the highest point one without evaluating if it was good for them or not.

Insanely difficult game. The "auction" grab frays the nerves, and forces you to often take sub-optimal factories, which makes the placement a mindbender. Sometimes, people are trying so many permutations (we allow that) that they forget the original configuration. I have a slight problem with the fact that not taking a factory is often the best strategy, and then you have nothing to do while others play. I've won only taking 5 factories(5 idle turns). Aside from that, nice change of pace game. Timer an absolute necessity.

I think the name is very misleading for this game, I did have a good time playing this game – and it’s very rare that I play a new game so many times in a month which shows its merits. 

My first two plays were with 5 of which most of my opponents were experienced, so naturally I didn’t win – but that’s definitely not a negative, because it showed me that a better player will win most of the times. I’ve had the game sitting on my shelves for a couple of month, but after trying it I was pretty sure that it would be a hit with my wife – and indeed I was right as she loves it! That’s not surprising as she loves tile-laying games, spatial element games and multiplayer solitaire game, and this game fits nicely into those categories. However, it also introduces another mechanic which makes this game stand out from a lot of other games that use the previously mentioned mechanics: a speed element! 

Every player turns over a machine, and then you need to grab the one you need the most before any other player! This adds a lot of tension as you need to think fast about how well the machine will fit into your factory. However, it doesn’t work as well with 2p (and is probably best with 4 or 5 players), but I’ve tried the 2p variant where 2 players are managing 2 different factories each and 4 machines are therefore turned over each round; it works well and produces a lot more stress and tension which is great!

A nice idea and good for an occasional gameplay. The grab a piece as fast as you can is just ok. There are a lot of pieces and the game has lots of maintenance. players have to keep up with their piping and are continuously rerouting, it can make for some annoying game play.

Another "spacial recognition" and/or "puzzle" type of game, which I kind of enjoy.  The speed element at the beginning of each round is rather interesting as well, since you want to get certain good machines quicker than someone else, but if you react too quickly, you could get stuck with a machine that won't fit properly on your factory floor without some serious modifications.

A high-quality, likable puzzle game.

This is as much a mental exercise as it is a game.  We play 2-player and don't worry too much about who grabs what tile.  We help each other finding smart ways to use the tiles we get.  The puzzle design makes you feel good when you use something well.  We've had more success when we focus on the end-of-game points, which you get when you are able to use the output of existing machines as the input of others.  This not only scores higher, but generally frees up your grey disks for other turns.  We wish the game came in a bigger box so that the individual player boards didn't have a fold.  That would make them lay flater and keep the little pieces in place better.  The scoreboard is ridiculously crowded and there is no 0 space.  The cardboard bits would be nicer if they were printed on both sides.  Also, many of the pieces are distinguishable only by color, so make sure you can tell them all apart.  We realize we are sounding nitpicky, but with all that said, we enjoy and recommend this game.  So look at the photos and see if any of this bothers you, but don't completely judge the book by its cover.  We would really encourage you to think about the gameplay instead.  Either the puzzle aspect will appeal to you, or not.  That is what this game is all about.

I'm not really a big fan of puzzle games, so it took a while for me to get this onto the table. My initial impression is that this is a solid puzzle game, that I don't mind playing, which is more than I can say for the other games in the genre.

The game is an elaborate input/output jumble, as players try to put 10 machines onto their cramped floor. The machines must be fed with goop, which comes in 4 colours. Some machines just create end-products, which means they are easy to set off in a corner, while others process the input goop into another, smaller quantity of goop, often of a different colour. High scores are best achieved by linking machines together, which is facilitated via elaborate pipe schemes.

As I said, puzzle games are tough for me to really get into. I do enjoy this one though, and I don't mind indulging the people in my extended group who love this on occasion.

The simultaneous selection mechanic really turned me off at first, but didn't really bother me too much with a few games under my belt.  At first, it's nearly impossible to see how you will get anything to fit together, but it gets a lot easier as your selection process gets more intuitive and you are then able to use your knowledge of the game to make the connections work.  Very, very fun to put your machines together and make the best factory you can!

One play - very likeable.  The mechanism of selecting your new machines has a party-game like feel, which means there's an opportunity for some gamesmanship ... i.e. the overly-competitive working to get an edge by blocking out or hovering during the process.  That's not a problem if your group plays well with others.  Also ... I'm not exactly sure what is supposed to happen if two (or more) people just do not want to take a new piece.  We always had one of us who was willing to pick one up just to keep the game going along ... but it seems like there should be some kind of mechanism in place to prevent that.  Still, being forced to make snap decisions and then deal with fitting them into your overall plan is kind of a decent analogy for running a business ... overall, good game.

Components: Each machine is unique; impressive. Other than that, a bit blank, but functional.

Experience: Not sure what this game is all about. Some machines just seem to fit, whereas others require way too much work. Not sure what the balance is between infrastructure and efficiency. Very punishing for someone who starts to get behind; once the leader has a commanding lead, they can start to play more conservative.

Way too much downtime for the player who chose an easy-to-place machine.

Ahhh.... Factory Fun.... one of my fave games.  I now finally have it thanks to JT!

A great puzzly type game with a bit of a race element, and by one of the nicest guys in the business, Corne.

I've played this only a few times but loved it every time.  Will I get sick of it?  I hope not!

A puzzle of a game that would be "multiplayer solitaire" except for the initial "machine grab" each round.  Normally I don't like the time pressures of real-time games, but this is pretty brief, and yet is really necessary to break up the continuous puzzle solving.  And I *so* like the puzzle solving.

I actually would rate this game an 8 since I really enjoy it, but it does have the downside that one player with AP can really make the game drag. I really like this one though. Some players don't like the "grab fast" mechanic, and I agree it can be a problem. It is possible to bid for machines instead as a house rule, but this can lead to worse AP.

RATING: 5
Factory Fun is a "multiplayer solitaire" style of game in which players are tasked with creating machines that are fed by resource reservoirs that collect in other reservoirs. At the beginning of the turn, each player flips over a machine tile and players select from those tiles. The machines are then, hopefully, placed into their factory and hooked up to the player's machine network. Connector pieces are available for a cost, which is subtracted from the score indicated on the machine itself, when the machines are scored at the end of each round. Machines already present, connectors, and reservoirs can also be moved for a cost. 

This game is somewhat "thinky", not necessarily in a strategic way, but more in a puzzle-solving way. The lack of player interaction will bother some people, but not me. Scoring is quite cumbersome and hard to track, because new pieces laid out have a cost and moving pieces has a cost and, sometimes, it's hard to tell whether a certain configuration will work, without laying it out. In general, this just isn't my type of game. I think it's a "love it or hate it" type of design...and I don't love it.

Factory Fun is not a game I would bring to the table when playing with my normal gaming group. "I don't want to play a multiplayer solitaire puzzler for the next hour, I want more interaction" is what they would say. And they are right: Factory Fun is more of a solitaire affair which is exactly the reason I enjoy playing it with my girlfriend. No direct interaction, no screwing each others plans. Just your own personal puzzle you have to solve. Something I do really enjoy from time to time!

RATING: 7
The speed element scared me, but it's not too bad.  In fact, it seems somewhat necessary, as alternatives I've heard of (like auctioning your tiles) would make the game far too puzzly.  It tends that way as it is.

An excellent multiplayer solitaire brainstorming thinky puzzle. It's fascinating to watch people that have to decide as quickly as possible on what piece of machinery they want to build into their factory, only to find out three seconds after they grab the tile, that it doesn't fit at all. Has to be played with people prepared to burn their brains solving their tricky puzzles though.

RATING: 6
Unforgiving spacial element-manipulation game.  I love the theme and the colorful presentation.  It's all wonderfully unique.  It can be very difficult and, more than most games, certain players might dominate because their brain is wired to see the patterns more quickly and correctly.

The fun feel doesn't necessarily contribute to a light, fun gameplay experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A puzzle like game where the pieces are randomly drawn.  It's a real-time deal, first-come, first-serve where each player picks one of the pieces.  Then comes the puzzle part where you have to fit it into your factory floor.  This can lead to a lot of analysis on the most efficient placement.

Enjoyable, but nothing too spectacular.  The only interaction is the part where you pick your piece either too slow...someone has gotten the piece you needed.   Or sometimes you pick it too fast and realize that you have nowhere to put it (5 point penalty).

I enjoyed the game, but maybe it should be called "Factory Layout".  It's definitely not rah-rah "Fun".

RATING: 6
Players acquire factory components - machines, vats, collectors, pipes - and connect them together to form a coherent production line.  Strange, yet rather addictive puzzle game.  Each round $nplayer "machine" factory components are flipped up and grabbed in real time.  Players then try to arrange their pieces on their own factory floor plan so that their pieces receive the correct input, and the outputs go to the right places.  Floor plans can be reorganized for a victory point cost, but for a larger payoff at the end of the game.  Rather nice brain burner, and refreshingly different.

Gosh, what a sublime puzzling fun game! 

Basically, you all flip over zany machine tiles and try to match up the outputs of existing machines to the inputs of the newly-drawn tiles. But you simultaneously flip over enough tiles for every player and whoever grabs first gets it! Make a mistake and don't want that one you just grabbed? Too late, gotta find a way to get it on the factory floor! Entertaining and cool, but not one I'd find myself re-playing with much frequency.

Connect different machines together in order to create the best factory.  Each machine takes one or more inputs and produces an output, and you get bonus points for wiring the output of one machine to the input of another machine.  Later rounds rapidly become more difficult, as you have to figure out how to most efficiently pipe the products around your factory.

RATING: 6
This game is indeed fun, but I am not sure it is such a great game.  There is very little player interaction.  Sure you are all racing to determine the best piece for you when the machines are flipped (and they have very funny names), but I, for one, can barely sort my own needs, let alone parsing and denying other players.  

I almost wish that rather than a race to grab pieces, there was a bidding mechanic using your points.  Now that would be interesting, but might slow an already fairly slow playing game.

RATING: 7
Hard to grasp at first, but should become much easier with experience.  Reminds me of circuit-building puzzles.  Bread-boarding analytical types should love this game.  Also reminds me of several computer games in the Pit Droids or Lemmings style where you have to build input/output loops.  The speed element adds some pressure, but only briefly since you can take the time to optimize your layout.

In a sentence it's a puzzle game for gamers. There are some elements that are a little more complicated than your average puzzle game. The multipliers, crazy pipe schemes, and colored stipulations where this comes in and this goes out add a real wrinkle to the puzzle experience. It's all needless complication, but I mean that in an an endearing way. It give the puzzle game experience a little weight. I like a lot of different puzzle games, and I was afraid the added complexity would take something away. This game manages to add that weight, but still capture that puzzle experience. This game seems to do it.

[1 play]  Totally insane game.  When they told me the method for choosing machines to put in your factory was slapjack, I expected something like Jungle Speed, but there was no way I could figure out at that speed what could go in my factory.  I ended up usually being last to choose and half the time picking stuff I thought would fit and then realizing it didn't.  On about the third turn I tore down my entire factory and moved everything (though mostly keeping connections and orientations and just shifting the whole thing around as a bloc).  I had negative scores so many times in a row that if I had a positive score it was referred to as "Positive eleven" (or whatever number).  I went totally back to zero on the scoring thing.  Then I ended up winning the game.  Truly bizarre experience.

No real player inter-action, more of a solitaire spacial puzzle with scoring elements. Challenging and enjoyable, but not so much a game. The key to winning apart from efficient building is to get machines to chain as this give bonus scores x5VPs at the end. Graphic design is murky and basic, but that might be a design choice to make taking machines less easy.

Instant classic.  A very advanced "Waterworks".  A spatial relationship game whose factory theme matches the game's dynamics.  This is a clever, pretty, different game.  Rules are simple & well written.  Easy to adjust the game to the length of time you have to play.  Combining another box would allow 4 more players, yet this can even be a game of solitaire.    I love this game.

The original version is in my top 10 (out of 1800 games), and so is this new version.

Not really any difference in play, but certainly some improvements:

*First of all plays up to 5 now, not 4. (Buy 2 boxes, and can play up to 10.)
*It includes the criss-cross expansion.
*a minor rule change.
*More attractive.
*2-sided boards, each with a unique expert side. (As before, the standard side is also unique.)
*Connectors are now tiles which are easier to handle, and if the board gets bumped, more easily returned to original configuration.
*Construction costs at bottom of the board.
*New scoring counters makes scoring faster and easier, and they are less likely lost.

More components than the insert is made for.

Realmente ouve uma melhoria mas ainda assim os novatos tem dificuldades em visualizar a direção da produção. As fichas de bônus ficaram pior pois escondem as quantidades de bônus. As lupas da versão cwali é bem melhor. Terei que fazer umas peças homemade de lupas.

RATING: 7.2
Jópofa, rövid, gyárépítgetős, erősen szoliter jellegű játék. A szoliter jelleget a gépekért folytatott verseny hívatott megtörni, de pont ettől a résztől féltem a legjobban. Ugyanis itt egy aki kapja marja mechanizmussal van egy kis reflexpróba is a játékban. 
Szerencsére nem volt ezzel semmi gond, mert nem annyira reflexpróba ez, semmint gyorsgondolkodás-próba, olyasmi mint a setben vagy a panic labben, csak itt nem ez a közpointi elem, hanem inkább a gyárépítés. Aki azonban elhamarkodottan dönt, könnyen veszteséggel építheti csak be a gépét, ráadásul akadályozhatja vele a következő körök építéseit is. Így nem igazán érdemes kapkodni, inkább kicsit tűnődni, aztán dönteni.
Ketten nagyon jól működött, gyorsan le lehet akár többet is zavarni egymás után. Viccesek a gépek nevei, nomeg lehet mulatni azon, hogy a "gyorsba" elvitt gépet végül 10-12 cső lerakásával sikerült csak beépíteni. Tényleg Factory Fun.

Egyelőre 7.5, mert kíváncsi vagyok, hogy hogy fog működni többen, illetve mennyire riasztja majd el az embereket a kapkodós szabály.

Factory Fun is a speed puzzle that is a bit more demanding than Ubongo and the like. If you screw up here you'll not only be disadvantaged for the current turn, you'll also have a hard time for much of the rest of the game.

Even if you end up in that position, however, it's still kind of fun to see how convoluted a pipe labyrinth you're able to come up with.

The game needs at least one play to learn the most important things you shouldn't do...

Not an easy game to play.  It really, really hurts my head, but I love it.  I'm pretty sure it would play well as a solitaire game, but any way you look at it, it's a fun puzzle to solve.  I actually think it's a bit like Age of Steam in that you're just struggling to stay in the game, just struggling to connect your new machine to the rest of your board.

Ugh...my head hurts...

Played twice more and find this game even better.  It's so satisfying to fit in a crazy piece at the end of the game.

This is a solid 7, maybe an 8.  Only played a couple of times at this point, but with more plays rating may change.  Trying to figure out optimal build--I like this.  Infinite variety and serious depth in the sense of seeking to optimize the engine.  I didn't think I'd like the drafting mechanic (I usually hate drafting and bidding), but it was actually fun trying to hurry and pick the best units.

This game reminds me of Twister.  It took me a few plays to get the hang of it.  The trick is to place the pieces so that future pieces can be connected but the best you can do is to make an educated guess because chance can ruin your plans.  Just about every time the game becomes cooperative rather than competitive.  I also enjoy playing this game solo with the main objective to get bonus points and more machines connected than before (11 is my best).

I suck at this game.

I mostly like that it is totally different from other games I own.

I initially got it because I thought it would be a simple game for people to grab onto.  It's actually much harder for people to pick up than I had thought.  Perhaps it's my teaching, but most people I've taught it to seem to struggle.

Either way, I think it's great, and I would almost always be up for a game of it, even though I know I'll be in dead last.

RATING: 6
Part of this game really appeals to the geek in me.  But I'm just not sure how "fun" it was.  Stressful?  Yes.  Frustrating?  Check.  Fun?  I guess so.

The speed element at the beginning of each round seems wildly out of place in what is otherwise an optimization game.  I wonder if the game would feel a bit more consistent if the machines were auctioned rather than speed-grabbed.

RATING: 10
Thirty to forty minutes jam-packed and overflowing with delightful brain-bending spatial manipulation.  Factory Fun plays best with the compete-o-meter dialed down slightly and players helping each other sort out the spaghetti puzzles when necessary.  This style of play also helps keep everyone involved throughout the game.

I love how Factory Fun features a quick-thinking tile grab phase followed by a more deliberative placement phase.  There's something for everyone.  Half of the enjoyment is poking fun at your own factory when things aren't working out for you!  There's enough luck in the game that the same player won't win every time.  This helps keep morale high and gives the game a surprisingly broad appeal.

This does seem a love-it-or-hate-it kind of game, and fortunately I love it. The game would overstay it's welcome if it ran any longer (beware the paralyzed analyst in this one!), but at it's current weight it's just right -- challenging, quick to resolve, and with a "just one more" quality the best games exhibit. Yes, it is mutual solitaire, but as a puzzle engine where you kibbitz on the other guy's move I put it right there with something like Carcassonne. The game does reveal deepening layers of strategy the more you play (or at least it did for us), and even if all my factory does is to manufacture excuses for why I lost, I find it a fun game to have played even when my teeth were kicked in, which is certainly a good sign. Yes, it is "homework in a box," and I can't account for why I find it fun ... but I do.

Great game requiring quick thinking and good spatial skills when picking up the machine tiles.  Putting the machines on your factory floor takes up the bulk of your thinking time and can be quite "math-y".  It is very tactical and quite a bit of a brain-burner and potentially be proned to analysis-paralysis.

Quite original game that feels like a puzzle where pieces are revealed simultaneously and belong to whoever gets them first. But if they cannot be placed effectively, the player loses points.

Picked up the Z-man reprint.  What a ridiculously fun game, certainly not for everyone but those who love it will be dreaming of factories for days.  The quality of the copy should also be mentioned, beautiful pieces, very useful insert in the box obviates the need for the bags they included anyway.

My biggest issue with this game is that I'm not playing it right now.

RATING: 6
After one play, this seems like a fun and relatively quick game of simultaneous route-building.  Because everybody is taking their turns at the same time, there is a little pressure to not take too long, which helps reduce the analysis paralysis.  Reasonable running time is about 40 minutes (4 minutes per turn).

It's not obvious how to win, although taking machines with big outputs and connecting them to big inputs for 15 or 10 bonus points is probably a key.  Also, the machines with the extra well of goo allow lots of flexibility.

RATING: 8
Factory Fun is both Factory and Fun. 

So all jokes aside, this spatial puzzle building game is my favorite of Corné van Moorsel’s game offerings (which are always somewhat abstract, somewhat mathy, but always accessible and fun) and the one that inspired others to get on board with real-time tile-grab individual spatial puzzle games (notably Vladaa Chvatil’s Galaxy Trucker and Michael Schacht’s Mondo). This is not only because I must have played hours of Pipe Dreams on my NES as a young chap but more so because spatiality, or more specifically complex chew your lower lip because you have no idea how to best work the spatiality available to you, in games is what turns my crank. This game escalates quickly during the rapid machine grab at the beginning of each round and becomes more and more brain-burning as the space that remains on players’ boards reduces to nothing. Accordingly, this game can be really punishing game (for AP prone players, and doubly so for players who can’t manage space), but I don't see that as a flaw. Overall, this is a vicious game that scales well across its player counts (although plays better with more) and a bit across differential skill levels with its expert boards (which render the game all the more melt your brain good).

Interesting spacial puzzle. Real time element to grab a tile wasn't as bad as I thought because if you grab something that doesn't build well in your factory, you may lose points. It was common for someone to grab something and then a few seconds later groan about how it doesn't fit haha.

After many plays though, it could be disadvantageous to new players (playing with someone who has wrapped their head around the spacial element).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
An exercise in self-inflicted pain. Who thought of the 'quick grab' mechanism? Surely an auction would have worked better for obtaining first pick of the tiles. Players inevitably co-operate to help out the one who's struggling and there's a huge advantage in scoring for those who can feed one machine from another, even if they couldn't place all of their machines. A highly original idea thrown away on underdevelopment.

I'm not really a puzzle game person, and I'm not good at rotating objects in my mind, but this game wasn't too offensive.  I like the implicit joke that factories can either feed paint back in a loop or turn it into garbage.  It is a little frustrating when you take a machine and can't use it at all, but I guess experience would make a difference here.  Choosing machines is not my favorite part, but I do like building my factory. (1 play)

First played January 19th, 2011. Taught in 15min, played in ~45 min with 5 players. Each player gets 2VPs, 4 vats (one in each color), three colectors, a factory mat and ~8 machines to turn over. At the same time, each turns over a machine and each race to determine if it will fit in their factory mat by connecting the machine to vats as input and collectors as outputs. Once you touch it, it's yours and others have to choose another tile. You can also spend 1-2 VPs to lay pipe (crosses, etc are 2vps). On subsequent rounds you can destroy pipe for free, move a machine for -2 and combine machine outputs to inputs as long as the input is more than the output. If the volumn matches you get a bonus (1=5VP,2=10VP,3=15VP) at the end of the game if you still have that setup. These bonues can use pipe to connect, doesn't have to be direct. You can not grab a machine at anypoint for zero points for the round. If you can't place the machine after taking it, it's worth -5VPs.  Machine are worth various amounts and have various inputs and output colors. It's worth a play if you know someone who has it and worth consideration in purchase if you like brain-burner games and high tension in getting things to fit together.

Jan09: Well, that's intriguing.  It definitely is a brain burn of a game.  You're forced to grab those machines quickly, but squeezing them into your factory is not an easy task.

I really appreciate the constraints and the sources of points.  You can only have 3 unfinished products at a time.  Couple that with big bonus for chaining machines and you have a nifty incentive structure.

And the spaghetti mess that ensues is just too much fun.  And of course there is a touch of spatial reasoning.

I need to try it with some more players.  One slow player could definitely kill it though :(

Factory Fun is a real time tile placement game. Unlike the famous tile placement game, Galaxy Trucker, Factory Fun offers slow paced tile placement. Factory Fun requires more logical thinking than any other tile placement games. Natually, the atmosphere of playing Fatory fun is hardly overwhelmed by big chaos. For me, Galaxy Truck is a little better, but Factory Fun is also a good choice to enjoy real time tile placement.

I've only played Factory Fun a couple of times. The heart of the game is a series of puzzles: how to place each newly purchased machine together with reservoirs and pipelines (often while rearranging the positioning of existing parts of your factory) in the most cost effective way while looking out for opportunities to connect machines directly together (generates more money at the end of the game) and also trying to ensure that the design of your factory remains suitable for adding yet more machines. However, the time and thought involved in the above sits uneasily with the 'quick grab' for the machines at the start of each turn. I like both aspects of Factory Fun, but I think it would have been a better game if players were competing not only for machines but also for other factory elements. This could place time pressure on players during the whole turn.

It's a lot like sudoku for me. It's a great implementation of what it's trying to accomplish, and I can see why people enjoy it. I wish I could enjoy it, too. But it's just a touch on the hard side of where I want it to be - which isn't that it's too hard in general, but too hard for the time and effort I can afford to spend on it. Which means that even if I want to play it, and I'm sure there will be times when I'll think it'll be fun to bring it out and give it another shot, I never will.

The only Cwali game I completely dislike.

You essentially play by yourself with the only exception being when you flip over the machines and have to grab the one you think you want before someone else grabs it. It is fun however, and make sure you keep your eye on end game bonus scoring as that's the key to winning (vs. short term high scoring machines).

A solid, elegant design that does what it sets out to do very well. Unfortunately, grabbing stuff in real time and solving ever more complex spatial puzzles is very, very far from my idea of "fun". I struggled through a single game and have no immediate desire to play it again.

I really like Factory Fun, the game mechanics are very easy to grasp, but, for me, it is one of the hardest games I have played to date. To win you need quick thinking and a good spatial intelligence, sadly spatial relationships are not my forte so the game is truly a challenge for me. 

I expect to continue playing this addictive puzzle game for a long time, I really had lots of fun playing Factory Fun, the play time is short and it can support up to 5 players without adding more play time!

I like more the game each time I play it. I recognize it is not a game for everyone (some friends find it too cerebral) but I like the way it challenges me, after all I like hard and heavy games. 

I´m (painfully) slowly getting better at it and I always want to play it. Try before buy but it is a winner in my book.

Nowadays I continue to play and love Factory Fun, however I’m downgrading its rating so my current feelings for the game match the BGG rating recommendation system. However I expect to play it for years to come and I don’t see it leaving my game collection. 

I finally got better at the game but, more often than not, the same players continue to win it (and I´m not among them). This is a positive for me as I really like to play against better opponents, that way I can really learn something new with every play.

Bottom line, it is a unique game that plays rather fast.

I used to rate this game more highly, but I've noticed a high frustration factor in my games of late, picking up machines that have the right inputs but are aligned improperly.  It's still a clever and quick little game, and if my wife ever signs on to BGG it will get a 10 from her.

Despite the frustration factor, 5 was too harsh.  Uprating to 6.

This is definitely not the game that I expected after reading through some of the comments and is a good example of "play before you buy."

The left hand flip, right hand grab mechanism is for party gamers (ugh!)... and the rest of the game might as well be a solitaire puzzle.  There really is no game here!

There is absolutely no player interaction and what little strategy you might have comes from how quick... no, let me rephrase that... how lucky, you are in gaining your machines.  When it comes to dexterity and speed in games (like Ligretto), I am a complete klutz... and this game only supports that fact.

A little more competition (maybe in the form of an auction for machines or a different way of selecting them) might fix the problem, but for me Factory Fun is absolutely no fun at all...  I have traded my copy away.

2016-07-11 - This game sits at a 7 after one play. I expected to rate it much higher after I saw some reviews on it. I love the core idea of building machines and pipes to feed the output of one machine into a new machine. What hurt the game for me (and the others I played with) was the speed element of evaluating and grabbing your machine each round. I think we will try one of the variants in the forums that does away with that next time.

I'm certainly having fun playing this game. I was originally afraid that people wouldn't like the way that machines are acquired but that hasn't been a problem. And I think everyone has enjoyed the process of building the most efficient factory. Currently it is one of those games that is being played  multiple times in a night. That has to be a good sign.

It hurts my brain in a good way. Seriously, the game is frustrating and mind-bendy in all the best ways. I even enjoy playing the solitaire rules that are posted.

I somewhat like playing this, but there's no getting around that this, more than any other game I've played, is really multiplayer solitaire. And what's worse, it's multiplayer solitaire where different people will at different times stall the whole game due to getting into a tricky situation.

RATING: 7
I enjoy puzzle games as well as speed games, so I enjoy this one.  I think that the game will probably get easier with more practice, but this really puts your brain to work.  It's difficult for me to visualize the different possibilities, and especially when you need to quickly grab a machine before your opponents.  The game length is just right, providing a really meaty experience in a short period of time.

Update: Traded away - no one I play with enjoys the game that much, so it didn't get played.  Traded for Bretonenboule.

Update 12/10: Reacquired new version to give it a second chance.

RATING: 9
Boy, I really enjoyed this one. A quirky puzzle game where players try to optimize the placement of their machines. The starting flip and rush felt a bit out-of-place (I'd have preferred an auction), but the heart of the game is the rejigging and shifting of machines.

Great artwork, and simple rules makes this an extremely replayable game. My only complaint would be the clear-plastic counters (very fiddly) and the cardboard arrows (also fiddly), which could have been done so that it was easier to pickup and manipulate.

Most people I know like this game but I would play just about anything before this. The mechanic of the game forces you to make a split second decision and then solve a solitaire puzzle. My mind is not able to capture and understand the information available in the quick decision so that part is just random for me. I am thus spending all of my time on my personal puzzle. I will not choose such a frustrating exercise when so many other great games are available.

The theme can be an initial barrier but this is tons of fun with the right crowd.  Feels like a saner, more serious version of Galaxy Trucker with more control and accountability.

I've enjoyed each game I've played whether it be by myself or with others.  This game can really be quite a puzzle and its always interesting to see what other factories look like at the end as well. Keys to doing well would be to seek to connect machines to other machines for the endgame bonus and seeing those connecting machines when they are available to be grabbed from the table. 

From my experiences, people need to give this game a second play before making a full decision as the first play can be frustrating as one figures out the nuances of the game.

Originally I was medium on it, but find it is growing on me. The big learning curve is not the rules to the game (which are actually simple just shrouded in a bad rulebook), but the secret is to understand how the machines need to interact with one another to maximize profits. 

I'm not a big fan of "Slap-Jack" aspect of choosing machines, but it seems to work and isn't bothersome.

A steep learning curve, fiddly pieces and enough brain burning activity to make my head still hurt the day after playing cannot stop me recommending the game to fans of games such as Robot Ricochet (the brain melt, solitaire play and staring at the board qualities while your headtank liquifies) and sado-masochists who adore the self loathing when they grab the wrong piece.

The design is highly intelligent.  It takes an advanced mind to create so many pieces which don't fit neatly.  

At the core of this game is an ingenious connection puzzle where the success of your turn is based on the profit of the factory unit, the amount of plumbing you have to install and the value of the input going into the factory unit. Where does this leave you?  With a sore head.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The title is very descriptive: It *is* both fun and takes place in a factory. A great variation on the tile laying and resource management mechanisms - really fills a hole in my collection.

Manage your own factory, to make it as profitable as possible: A first-to-grab round determines which machine you will try to fit into your workflow on the floor, as the output from one machine might be reused as input for another, necessitating a more or less complex system of pipes to route ressources.

This is rounded out with a wonderfully simple economic model, that really is easy to grasp and implement.

Played it a couple of times already, and it seems that there is more to optimising your factory than apparent at first glance - I want to play this again, and luckily it takes about 5 minutes to explain, and 30-45 minutes to play with 4 players (and it shouldn't change much with more or fewer)

This one strikes me as a total original. It feels perhaps a bit less like a game than a puzzle-solving competition, and the puzzles associated with optimizing the layout of one's factory are HARD, especially if you make a mistake at the start of a round and "grab" the wrong machine. The components are beautifully produced, though, and looking at your board at the end (if you've done even passably well) you get a bit of that feeling familiar from AGRICOLA of having made something rather beautiful and charming.

Oooh I'm afraid this might be heading for the trading list!  We've had it out 3 times and a fail each time.  My husband leans toward an engineering mind, too, but apparently not far enough.  We are incredibly frustrated with this game.  When we reconfigure something we find it impossible to keep track of what we moved and added so we are never sure if our scores are right.  Each time we've quit by the 4th machine because I can see the steam coming out of his ears.

Fun game, but I don't like the free-for-all part of the draft mechanic.  I think there is an awesome game here with some modifications to the draft, like the player in the lead (including +5 multiples from machine cascades) must wait 10 seconds before drafting her/his machine.

You also don't interact a lot with the other players, but the flip side is that it is easy to turn this game into a solitaire game by drawing 10 machines and trying to fit them all on the board.

played once with 3 players and we were all befuddled with optimizing our boards.  Machine selection was unsatisfying for the most part.  

took well over the 45 minutes suggested - we all got caught with poor initial placement and trying to rearrange as the game went on.  We got to 6 machines and turns were taking 15+ minutes to complete.

I suspect it might get faster as people started to get used to how the game works.

I would like to play again, and it might be a fun solitaire puzzle solving exercise.

This is totally my style of game.  It has a speed element.  It has a puzzle element.  If you react too fast you are bound to take a machine that doesn't make sense.  I had to laugh at the comment in Counter magazine - Factory Fun - it is definitely about Factories... lol   Other than the grab a tile speed  element this game is definitely solitaire - but that doesn't bother me at all.  Very refreshing in a dry sort of way?????

Love this Game!! great Solo if you like puzzles to solve very streamlined only 'Con' is when playing with 2 or more its first to grab a machine tile gets it this game which seems like pure strategy has a smash and grab aspect. I think a bidding aspect with multiple machines whould have been better
Aside from that fantastic if you can still get it ;-)

RATING: 7
A very simple game of filling your factory floor with machines which will efficiently produce tanks full of green stuff, orange, red and blue stuff. Though there are rewards for building the machines themselves, the real points come from integrating your production line so that your tanks of coloured blah are as profitable as possible.

A nicely produced and entertaining family game that can easily see numerous plays in an evening. For once, the stated play time is conservative rather than optimistic. We've bashed out plays in 15 minutes.

A nice filler which, whilst mostly lacking in direct interaction, is still a fun group experience.

RATING: 6
Oof, this games seems like such a great idea, but I'm just not any good at it.  It was fun to play as an experience to see how well each of players could manage their factory and the speed element was certainly an interesting twist, but it felt a little too blah for me.  After each game, I really wasn't dying to play again, but it may be one of those that improves as we get better.  I can imagine cutthroat races for tiles and intense competition once we gained more insight into how best to plan out our boards, but I'm just not willing to put in the effort needed to get to that point.  It's fun for a change of pace, but not one that I expect to play very often.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5

I'm not a huge fan of spacial-perception puzzles,and therefore this game doesn't start of great with me. Combine this with the extreme luck factor (especially in the last few rounds) and it's definitely a big stinker for me. My rating might be a bit better if there were a way to predict what the upcoming tiles would look like, and thus plan the layout of your board a bit ahead.

RATING: 7
The ultimate in solitaire games.  Factory fun has players trying to build up a factory.  Each turn factory machines are flipped over and players slap the one they want (the only interaction).  You then try to legally place your machine into your factory wherein each machine takes input(s) of one or more of four different colours and has ouput(s) which are also of the four colours.  The output(s) must be stored in a vat (it cannot just leak onto the factory floor).  You pay for pipes and the vats and hope you are making more than you're spending.  An intriguing puzzle that plays within 45 minutes.  I enjoyed it but not sure if it merits more than 5 plays.

Frustratingly fun and silly PUZZLE GAME. Must both maximize the "factories" you place with your inputs/outputs as well as play the game for most overlapping points (the beads you earn when an output is used to feed an input).

Quite enjoyable. Of course, it's... wait for it... Take It Easy on steroids. Virtually no player interaction, but about as much fun as one can have with such a game.

We played, we laughed; we played again.  This is a wonderfully thinky game, that will become a late-night staple.  I can see that if your group suffers from analysis paralysis, this is a game that you would rather gnaw your leg off than play, but it looks like being a half-hour favourite... if the right people are at the table.  It also looks like it will scale well, since the game is going to progress at the speed of the slowest player, regardless of the number.  I'll be looking for a second copy at some point.

Much to my surprise, Rosie likes it too; I knew I married her for a reason.

Wanted to like this, but on the second game I was already bored and frustrated.

I'm fairly bad at pattern-recognition games anyway. The rule that you have to be able to restore your board to its previous state if you find you've made an invalid move just *destroyed* me. I had to abandon a game because I could not remember what my board looked like before I started messing with it.

Fun game that's almost as good solitaire as multi-player. (Very similar to Don Quixote in that regard, but much more fun than that one.) It's more of an abstract than a euro, and it'd probably make a great app.

It's absorbing, fairly easy to explain, light -- a great game for its weight.
---
It's not that much fun as a 2p game. I find the combo of very limited machine choice and time pressure a poor one for me. It's more enjoyable solitaire than with 2. At this point I'd say 5p > 4p > 1p > 2p, with 3p TBD.

This game will burn your brain and quickly.  There's too much spatial thinking that must happen too quickly -- based on the piece-bidding structure -- for this game to be deeply enjoyable for me.  But others in my gaming group enjoy, and I picked up a $6 copy at Geekway, so.

Um misto de raciocínio rápido e planejamento é o que exige o Factory Fun. A cada rodada, uma máquina fica disponível para cada jogador.

Quem conseguir usar mais máquinas para abastecer outras máquinas leva. Dá muita dor de cabeça, mas sempre me diverte.

This game is pretty much an exclusive trial in optimizing the setup of your factory. There really isn't much player interaction, so there isn't much you can do to hinder your opponent. Grabbing tiles that give extra resource generators is probably a good idea. Don't be afraid to wait until the other players have chosen, if none of the machines will work well for you.

This game achieves something I hadn't thought possible: A thinky game that plays quickly.

A very nice and original form of game play. Some may be turned off by the fact that the selection is done simultaneously (just grab the one you want), but it works very well in this game. When you grab a machine, you must ensure it gets the supplies it needs and has a bin for the output. But if the output of one becomes the input of another, you get a bonus. Each pipe you use reduces your score, so you must be efficient while also thinking quickly. Well worth a try.

RATING: 7
While I'm not really a fan of the grab-it-first mechanic, I do like trying to puzzle out and optimize my factory.  There's a delicate balance between scoring points in the current round and setting yourself up to score bigger in subsequent rounds.  You can even get by scoring negative points in a round, and sometimes it's really difficult to determine what's worth it and what's not.

The sad thing about this game is that it has to have "fun" in its title to convince you it's fun.

My main issue with this game is the speed aspect of grabbing tiles.  Most games I play, everyone grabs a tile within two seconds, so I'm stuck with the leftover to incorporate or pass.  While my score due to this is usually decent compared to the others, it's absolutely little fun not playing machinery half of the time and having little decision on the others.

This game would be immensely improved (mechanically and thematically) by an auction of the pieces.

Otherwise, the cost of moving/adding pieces from your points and having power sources are decently implemented.

I really like puzzles so this game is right up my alley. It's basically multi-player solitaire since there's no real interaction (except for racing for initial tiles.) You're trying to build pathways between your machines to earn money and bonus points. Building connections between them costs so you have to think carefully about placement. 

I very much disliked the insert -- couldn't figure it out on my own... but got it once I saw the BGG pictures.

Galaxy Trucker may be more fun, but this game is much easier to teach (far fewer concepts to get across). It plays quickly too, but can feel more like a puzzle than a game. Compared with GT, there is less of the frantic piece-grabbing & more thoughtful rearranging of tiles (and obviously no "piloting the space ship" phase!)

There is plenty of variety for future plays given the quantity of machines & different factory board layouts.

The components (Z-Man edition) are ok. Not quite up to the standard of some other games (the cardboard feels a bit low-quality/recycled or something and the layers can separate in places), but at least the pieces punched out without much damage.

Factory Fun was... fun.  Somehow, my brain wraps around this game very well, so I didn't have many frusterating situations, even in my first game.  However, the "I've made a bad choice," hosing that happens in this game is quite severe, and the quick draw element makes bad decisions not unlikely.

RATING: 6.5
Yes, it's mostly solitaire. But it does add one key ingredient to an otherwise heavy thought game - real time competitive piece selection. For those that are analysis heavy types, this mechanic both balances out some of the analysis paralysis and greatly disturbs those that are not fond of real-time play. I had fun playing and learned to not grab the first piece I could reach but rather to have a pseudo shopping list in mind. The real-time aspect does add quite a bit to the tension.   


For truly cruel play, add a 3-minute timer that is flipped once the last piece is selected (or declined so as to put pressure on those that took pieces more quickly without knowing how to use them).

Nice puzzle pipe building game, it is interesting to design your layout. The spoons style tile grab at the beginning of a round seems to be at odds at the more cerebral puzzle of how to place the machine minimizing future restrictions. Probably could use a timer during the placement phase ala its successor - Galaxy Trucker.
Fortunately there are several ways to handle the initial selection - auction, draft etc, I may experiment with a few as part of play.

RATING: 7
Have played only the single player variant of this game, and I did it incorrectly. There was something that I didn't quite understand while playing it and that was that you can rearrange all the machines in your factory before each turn after drawing a new machine. You then have to rearrange/move your pipes which costs points, and you have to then place new pipes etc which costs points. I think that This game would work better as a computer game simply because it is a bit involved in counting the points. Where a computer can automatically do this for you relieving one of the burden of manually having to think. Some people might argue that it is a great game for working on your maths skills. Maybe it is, but this is not a game intended for people who just want to sit down and put some machines together. Maybe I will just make up my own variant where points aren't a factor. For exmaple, removing any cost associated with placing/moving/rearranging the factory or pipes. Will give it a go again and write more.

RATING: 5
An interesting concept somewhat spoiled by the simultaneous nature of selecting parts, first to grab it is the one who gets it, which turns what COULD have been a fascinating puzzle of elegant design into a frustrating exercise of trying to put square pegs into round holes and throwing them away when they don't fit anywhere. If, instead of grabbing a piece from the four available before someone else grabs it, there were always four available on each player's turn to pick one, or always four up for auction each turn, I would have given the game at least 2 points higher rating.

It's more of a competitive puzzle than a board game, but there's something very satisfying about building the ultimate factory. I'm not sure I like the dexterity phase where players race to grab their preferred machine tokens, but it helps bring some much needed interaction to the game, plus it's super easy to use a variant if dexterity isn't your thing.

Overall: I can't bring myself to rate it much higher, as there's just too many little quirks that prevent it from being perfect, but it IS a ton of fun. Just watch out for analysis paralysis prone players.

This game gives me thoughts of the starting phase of Galaxy trucker but none of the destruction of space travel. This is a real brain burner once you start to get the idea of the this puzzle-y game.  It's got a bit of a real time aspect when choosing a machine.  However, when placing the last few machines, one really has to think outside of the box and weigh you cost compared to placement.  Fun unique game that really needs multiple plays to get the hang of.

I have only played once, as a 2p game, way back in 2012. I would not be unhappy to play again, even though I'm not a big fan of the real-time aspect. The main problem for this game though is that Galaxy Trucker stratches similar gaming itches while being a much better game in most if not all respects. At least this does have a bit more of a puzzle-solving aspect, albeit a slightly weak one.

a weird combination of puzzle with time pressure.

Pros:
Mind bending fun.
I enjoy Rube Goldberg like devices and this is (somewhat) similar to that.

Cons:
Like many other players I don't care for the grab the factory mechanism.

Musings:
We play with what I think is a better mechanism for machine selection. We deal one extra tile stack (one more than the number of players). We alternate who goes first and then each player takes a machine.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pros: unusual idea, building a Rube Goldberg-esque factory with various machines feeding into each other.  Geeky design/layout fun.  Satisfying when you get a good layout built.
Cons: can be cumbersome to rearrange your factory, and sometimes players get confused and forget where things were.  Hassle to set up and clean up, due to many fiddly bits.  Real time auction grab of machines each round seems a little at odds with the cerebral spirit of the layout phase.

2011-05-16: The game grew on me and I like it more, as I played during various conventions since a2na likes it so much. And the new Z-Man edition has nicer easier to use components (yay!) but (alas) a much larger box.

I suspect one would need several plays to get a good feel for where the ideal positioning of the sources might be.  So I don't see that it's liable to be a great game between a seasoned player and a beginner.  But as long as we maintain roughly equal skill, I suspect it'll be a modest hit at our house.

First I like to get into the mood by looking at the cover art on the Z-Man Games box. Strangely feeding tubes of four different colours of goo into machines to make other quantities of coloured goo is "fun". At first I was turned off by the simultaneous machine grab. I like Galaxy Trucker's piece grabbing, but here it seemed like a strange auction mechanic along the lines of Pack and Stack. It works, but I prefer the grab variant suggested by Curt Carpenter. This variant bumps the game up a notch of control for me. It keeps the speed element, but makes it a little more forgiving, while at the same time introducing a clever handicap mechanism for playing with children or less experienced players.

The components look a lot more interesting in real life than in the photos here on BGG. They're top quality and have a hefty feel to them. Lovely.

With a timer for slow groups this is a relatively fast flowing game that is powered by the melting of your brains. Some complicated relocation of your factory pieces in the latter rounds can really slow down proceedings without the introduction of a five minute timer, unless you have a reasonable group that can manage time appropriately. Simple to teach. Easy to understand. Plays in easily under an hour and makes for a good opener or closer for an evening.

Summary of Curt Carpenter variant:
At the beginning of the game give each player eight bidding chips and use the pillar marker as a bidding marker. Flip the new machines as usual. Instead of just taking machines players put their bidding marker next to machines along with any bidding chips they wish to use. Players need to outbid a marker already placed by a machine if they wish to take that machine. Remove the penalty for taking a machine you don't place.

Wasn't expecting much, since I'm not a puzzler fan, but this impressed me. Better than Galaxy Trucker, as I find the agony of realizing I have to pipe around the entire board more hilarious than having random dice cause random things to hit random parts of my ship. Easier to teach than Galaxy Trucker too. Great balance in going for scoring now or going for the machine-to-machine windfalls at the end. Very tense tile-drafting round. Probably the only board game where I can not give a crap about the other players, yet still have fun (by laughing at their pipes). That's high praise, since high player interaction is one of the most important things I look for.

This game initially appealed to my background in chemical engineering.  Granted, it has little to do with actual plant design or operation, and as at least one other has pointed out, seems to violate the principles of mass balances.  Still, we found it to be a pleasant puzzle type game.  The competitive rush for machines insures that people don't take too long to analyze what they may need but also can can lead to some problems if you make a slight error in your analysis -- such as reversing two input streams.  Still, the puzzle like and albeit limited connection aspect are more than enough to amuse me.  I'm very happy to own it.  [03/14/2008]

Factory Fun -- Played once; four-player.  I'd heard this was a brain-burner, so I was surprised by how quickly it plays.  Also, after only one session, I can see how to improve my play next time.  For example, when possible, choose tiles with high output numbers -- not only because they can supply more inputs, but because they can supply higher bonuses.  The only issue I find a bit worrisome is the need for very quick eyes and fingers in selecting and grabbing tiles.  I look forward to future plays.

It's not that it's a bad game; it's actually a great game, probably. It's just that my brain, which typically excels at spacial route-connection games like this, couldn't figure out a damn thing that was going on by round 7.

Maybe if I play it a few more times I will be able to actually play through an entire game without going loopy.

I have waited 2 years for this reprint and it was well worth the wait!
The components are excellent,a lot better than I expected.

The game plays a lot like a puzzle but is deceptively difficult.The joy to get a series of efficient machines is what encourages another game.

After more plays I have found this to be difficult to hook up a really good factory and that has taken the shine off.
Just too much effort for little enjoyment.

A very crazy puzzle game. Players are trying to link machines with powerlines that connect to several different coloured generators. The tricky bit is how to be place the machines so that you spend less money on connecting them in order to generate the most power (ie VPs). It costs money to reposition generators and powerlines so be careful what machines you grab!Also key is making sure you manage to connect your outputs to get the multiplier bonus at the end.

I suck terribly at this game but the experience is always fantastic. I like that players offer to help each other in their restructing. Fun! Worth picking up for the gaming experience.

I enjoy Factory Fun - we play the bodily fluids version, where blue is water, red is blood, and yellow and brown are...well, I play this version anyway. (My wife prefers that the "substances" are fruity ice cream toppings. Boring!)

Believe me, this really enhances the game, especially given the names of some of the machines, such as the "Megabrowner" and "Packomatic" - hope I got those correct. Poop jokes never grow old!

Anyway, two things can potentially detract from this charming puzzle game: 1) the speed grab for pieces - it makes sense, I can see why the designer chose to deal with machine selection in this way, but our local majority felt that the game would be better simply taking turns with respect to the order of choosing. The way it is, the game rewards the speed of players' pattern recognition, and this can be very frustrating for some. It also doesn't seem to fit the pace of the rest of the game. Also, somewhat ironically, the highest scorers are often those who pick last or next to last, and so we question that order of choice is even that important. UPDATE: I think you can just take turns going first when choosing machines; it doesn't seem to impact play that much. Further UPDATE: Just taking turns choosing works extremely well with two players, but we prefer the speed grab for 3 or more! It makes the game faster and focuses the attention on machine integration, as opposed to selection - this enhances the FUN in Factory Fun. Even further UPDATE: after many. many games, we prefer the speed grab in all situations! Yay for the speed grab! Depending on the players, it can even get a little vicious!

2) Lack of competition - even against the game. Some cooperative games can be said to be competitive, as you are striving together against a tasking game engine. But Factory Fun is a strange bird, so far as games go. It doesn't feel very competitive, even though it is not a cooperative game. As a puzzle game, we often end up sort of cooperatively working on one another's factories - making suggestions and so. This further undermines the "gamey" feeling, making it feel more like a fun group jigsaw or something. This isn't a bad thing - but if you are looking for a "game" to play, this one may miss the mark due to this aspect. After several plays, I've decided that I really like this element of Factory Fun. It's a refreshing change from other games I play.

I think this is a neat game, and always look forward to playing it - especially with varying numbers of players. I will admit that it is a very different kind of game, and my initial impression was "meh". But the more I play it, the more I enjoy it.

The KEY to this game, as with much in life, is maximizing those *machine-to-machine* connections.

This was a weird little puzzle-type pipe-building game.  I don't understand the details of the game yet, but it's quite interesting.  With a "speed tile grab" at the beginning of each round, it felt like a combination between Ubongo and some type of tile-laying or train game.  You can supposedly play the game with only one player, so I might be tempted to buy this one.

Gépek, csőrendszerek, nyitó és végtartályok. Jó kis építgetős játék. A játékosok csővezetékeken különböző gépeket próbálnak meghajtani négyfajta anyaggal, amiért pontokat kapnak, amiből még több csővezetékkel próbálnak még több gépet munkába állítani. A csővezetékek nem állandóak, pontokért áthelyezhetők, átépíthetők. Nagyon jó kis játék, viszont szinte semmilyen interaktivitás nincs benne, egyedül a gépek elhappolásakor jelenik meg. Így tökéletes két személy, párok részére is, de akár két játékot összerakva 10-en is játszhatják egyszerre. Egyértelműen rétegjáték, de aki szereti a gondolkodós építgetést annak tökéletes.

RATING: 4.5
So far, I'm surprised at the frustration level when playing this one.  The speed grabbing portion is the worst culprit since there are probably one or two machines that won't fit at all on your board and you are guaranteed to get one of them if you wait too long.  Also there are a lot of machines with just an end product (black), and if you get a couple of those early on it will sink your whole game.  Some extra types of cross over pieces would go a long way to reducing some of the hair pulling when trying to place a machine.  I believe they did add some new tiles like that to the Z-man reprint.

RATING: 6
This is an ok speed puzzle.  Quickly grab what you think will work best and see if you were right.  Make the most of what you've taken.  There really isn't any interaction, with most people working cooperatively trying to figure out what the hell they can do with the piece they grabbed.  I like to think you are a condiment factory with Ketchup, Mustard and BBQ, a shame that the Mayo has to be blue.  I think that most people will think of this game as "Factory" more than "Factory Fun", but it is entertaining to play this once.

OK, so it's mostly multiplayer solitaire and feels much like an intricate, puzzle-oriented game of Tetris, but man, it's so addictive. The quick grab for the machines at the start does a great job of shortening the length and creating a little tension, and I absolutely adore the puzzle aspect of putting the pieces together. It's really a game you'll love or hate, and I just appreciate that it got reprinted.

Factory Fun is a spatial puzzle that is accessible (takes no time at all to explain the rules) and fun (i mean, fun is RIGHT THERE IN THE NAME).  

it feels really unique to me.  i like the building aspect of the game --- you get a sense of satisfaction looking at your factory at the end of the game like Caverna, but the way everything has to interconnect makes it even more special.

the tension of trying to grab a machine that works in your factory makes this puzzle exciting.

It's another puzzle/race game, except that there's no timer - just everyone else telling you to hurry up! Each player gets a board (slightly different shapes), and a set of supply markers - these supply red, blue, yellow, and brown stuff (machines process stuff into different stuff and/or money/VP). Each player reveals a randomly chosen machine with one hand, then grabs a machine to use with their other hand (if you touch it, it's yours; must pay $ to discard a machine unused). Once you have it, you play it onto your factory. Its inputs/outputs must all be connected -- you can grab connector pieces from the common pool, and also use the supply tokens you started with. Every piece costs $1 to place, and you can move up to 2 machines for $2 each. The machine you just added produces $, which is added to your score. At the end, high score wins.

Not a bad puzzle game, but it may be too difficult for me! Need to play again.

RATING: 6
This is one of those games that I don't really view as a game.  It's more of a solo puzzle experience and then afterward you compare scores to see who did best.  It's fun and the puzzle is interesting but I typically want more interaction in my games.

There is one small piece of interaction in this game.  At the start of each round each player turns over a machine piece into the center of the table and each player tries as quickly as possible to scan their own board and the available pieces to choose the one they want before the other players can.  I honestly felt this was more stressful than excitingly tense.  I chose to compare it to something like Galaxy Trucker where if a player throws a face-up piece back it is up for grabs for everyone but even if that piece would be perfect for you and someone else gets to it before you there are plenty of others just like it.  I didn't feel that way in this game, if you miss a good piece (for you) in a round you can fall woefully behind.  And because of the small sample size each round (one piece per player) there is a lot of room to be screwed over, especially in later rounds when you already have an established machination on your board.

I did enjoy this game nevertheless.  I like the mechanic of putting together this set of tubing to shift your colored liquids around in the most efficient way, i.e. least amount of tubing.  It was a fun puzzle exercise and I find myself interested in playing again to see how well I can do and what the other players can come up with.  The weird shaped "expert" boards look like a lot of, albeit masochistic, fun too.

However, my opinion on games like this remains that I can play it on my own and I play board games for more interaction, competition, and socializing.

It's supposed to be a fun game, like its name implies, but it's not really that fun. The puzzle annoys me and it's not interesting in matter of strategy so there's nothing here I can possibly want. No fun no strategy.
I'm not a game for fun consumer. I like games that challenge me in a much more dramatical way than a series of random factories that I have to randomly put on a board to find the best input/output given by different colors!
For fun I like to play a few games (really only a few) but with my spare time I prefer an occasional movie or dinner out! My time is getting too short (sort of speaking I hope) for "fun" games!

I know, all Eurogames have a strong puzzling element: you're basically optimising your own score. But Factory Fun is almost all puzzle and no game. It's clever, but also utterly dull and uninspiring.

I have a mixed reaction to this game. On the one hand, it is very clever and interesting to play, yet I am put off by the impression that good fortune in what tiles are drawn far outweighs any efforts towards planning. Fascinating at first, but I suspect I may tire of it quickly.

Update: I traded this after getting Galaxy Trucker. Factory Fun strikes me as a serious game, where I'm a bit concerned by the luck element. Galaxy Trucker adds even more luck, but in the process becomes less serious and I have more fun playing it (even though my children beat me mercilessly every time).

I'm generally not a fan of the genre of visual/spacial puzzle games (Ubongo, etc), or puzzle games in general, because I am so spectacularly bad at them. Add the speed element and I am guaranteed to lose, by a lot. So my rating here reflects that. This game is a very clever design, and the grab for the tiles makes it more interactive than something like Turbo Taxi which is basically a double- solitaire game. I would play again to try to do better than my first pathetic attempt but I wouldn't necessarily request this game with so many others on my "Want to Play" list.

RATING: 6.5
[Cwali 06 edition] {Factory; puzzle, real-time; optimal 4p} Factory Fun is a unique puzzle game where players have to grasp a factory machine out of the available. However, it's not very hectic because players will usually pick up a machine carefully and slowly when they believe a machine can help them. I think players will grasp machine faster and faster when they are more familiar with the game. Thus, FF is more interactive than other puzzle games, in which players usually solve puzzle in solitaire. It's suitable for family and schools, but not good for very young players. FF should be replayable, too.

Solving the puzzle may take time. A timer can be used to limit the time of each turn. If a player cannot fix his factory before the time goes, the new machine shall be discarded. However, it's very fun to solve a puzzle or watch other solving a puzzle. 

FF is not a real strategic game; it's more tactical. Although players do know which machines will be available, they can create the floor plan with greater flexibility so that large scale of reposition can be avoided.

The quality of the bits isn't good enough. The colors of the players are too dry. The connectors are too think and weak. The transparent plastic markers aren't necessary.

No, there's not much player interaction.  Yes, its great fun anyway.  Figuring out how to connect your machines and pipes for the best score is a really enjoyable brain-teaser of a puzzle game.  Its also fast playing, works great for 2-4 (or even solitaire) and is very, very addictive.

House rules:
* Flip your tile with one hand, then you must touch your center pillar before you can grab a machine, all using the same hand.

* If two players touch a tile at the same time, the player closer clockwise to the one who flipped that tile gets it.

* The first machine is random instead of grabbed.

Love this game! It fits with my logical programming mind. Great fun trying to quickly grab the 'right' machine and finding it's not quite what you expected when you get it. Then you have to reconfigure your whole factory to fit it in. Love the pipes!

Mostly only played 2 player, but more players are great because there are more choices of machines (but you have to be quick!)

This is a fun game of efficiently linking up factory components so that the inputs and outputs fit together in the least amount of space.  There is also a speed mechanism in which you have to spot the tile you want and snag it before the other players can.  I don't really care for the speed thing, but I have to admit that the game is fun.

Factory? Absolutely ... plenty of machines making, ummm, well, I guess colored liquid products here. Fun? If there is any, I'm not seeing it. This game, while undoubtedly clever, falls into that category of "game" that seems to be to be more work than fun. In fairness, I don't like this whole genre of puzzle games - Ricochet Robot, Turbo Taxi, etc. Add to that the speed element of choosing your machines, and this one has just about every element I dislike in games, each piled on atop the other. Sooo ... take my rating with a grain of salt if you're inclined to like puzzle games - this is probably one of the better ones out there. I've solved this puzzle, though, and the solution is not to play Factory Fun.

RATING: 8
There are a handful of games where no matter what move you make, it's the wrong move.  For the spatially challenged, Factory Fun defines the category.  Each turn proves to be more frustrating than the previous by committing your factory to an increasingly haywire arrangement.  The rush to grab a machine makes you feel like you picked the wrong piece, when they're ALL the wrong piece!  If you can get comfortable with that, this is the holy grail: a jigsaw puzzle for gamers.

This game is horrible and was the turning point in resolving my board game addiction.  I also do not trust the opinion of Zee Garcia anymore.  I should stop... but I will not. If you enjoy life and all of its wonder and you value your time, family relationships, and mental health do not own this game.  Unless you love work if doing work at night without pay sounds fun to you this is your game.

A fun little filler. The simultaneous selection mechanism balances the AP potential with a gut-feeling grab a good machine.

Fantastic puzzle game that is truly FUN to play - combining brain power, having a laugh at yourself (either your play or your predicament), a mad grab for pieces, and a bit of cooperative play - where else can you get that mix?  The flip-and-grab method of choosing machines keeps it from being too much of a brain burner and ratchets up the fun factor.  In our games, players often help each other out, making suggestions for how others could improve their placement (or even just find one!).  Works great in solitaire form, too.  Another Cwali game with excellent components.

Factory Fun has "fun" right there in the title, so it must be fun. As a huge fan of Galaxy Trucker, I've been eager to try the game's inspiration for a while now (according to a podcast I listened to a while back, Vlaada designed Galaxy Trucker after trying Factory Fun and wanting to give the game a second half where you take the thing you've built for a test drive). Knowing it would be difficult to track down a copy, I happily jumped at the opportunity to try the game out at BGG.CON. While I still solidly prefer Galaxy Trucker, I enjoyed seeing its roots. Both games have the players grabbing at tiles to add to their individual boards to connect in to their previous tiles for the purposes of building a unified machine. That in and of itself is entertaining, but rather than just have the players take their constructions apart to put back in the box afterward, I appreciate that Galaxy Trucker adds in the second half of the game where the game itself mercilessly takes apart your construction with asteroids and space pirates. Watching your beautiful ship fall apart in Galaxy Trucker is the icing on the cake that turns a good game into a great one.

About [thing=24417][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=24417][/thing] is a very puzzly game about building a factory by laying on the board pieces of machines, reservoirs and connectors. The goal is to make the most profitable factory - players gain money with the machines, and also can make more when they connect an output of energy from one machine to the input of the same kind in other machine.

However, the inputs and outputs of the machines can't be left unattended, they must always connect to something (an input, output or reservoirs), which becomes increasingly hard as the play goes by, since there is less room, all the reservoirs are already used, and connecting and moving things gets really costly.

Be ready to scratch your head (without touching the pieces) in order to figure out a way to fit any of the machines that appear later in the game.

If this was [thing=822][/thing], you would need to connect cities walls made of the same material (wood, brick or stone), while also keeping in line with the sort of activity that occurs in the region of the city (religious, comercial, political). Farmers would only be able to attend cities of a given size and with a distance of no more than 5 tiles, and you would also need to build wagons. For roads it would be necessary to survey the area and proceed only in paths with small contours.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
Each round machines are revealed, and players take one (is a speed matter - the first one to touch a machine, takes it). Players are required to put the machine in their factory, or lose 5 money if they can't or don't want to - except the player that was the last to take a machine part, as this player can see if the machine left will fit, and if it doesn't, discard it without cost. Each machine takes 1 to 3 inputs from reservoirs (yellow, blue, red, and green) and produces one output (of the same colors, or black). You must always connect all reservoirs and machines correctly by using the connectors (the pipelines).

Players receive the amount of money written on the machine part. Then pay whatever cost is necessary to put the machine in place - putting connectors, moving pieces, and whatnot. This can indeed mean that you can gain 5 money when taking a machine, only to spend 8 money to fit it in place, thus losing money (points). This might be worthwhile, however, if you manage to connect one output with an input, which can earn 5, 10 or 15 bonus points at the end of the game, if the connection remains until the end.

The game will end after 10 rounds and the winner will add the current money they have with the bonus (if any) they got, and the person with the most money/points will be the winner.

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
Where to put the machines and how to best connect them, not only the least costly way, but also allowing for more machines to be added later, and trying to gain bonuses by connecting outputs with inputs.

There are decisions involving the movement of pieces and the route of connectors, as the parts of the factory will, most likely, change quite some times in order to accomodate the new machines.

The decisions are made harder because of the unknown - players are making decisions without hard information about what machines will appear later in the game - you just know they will have 1 to 3 outputs and 1 input - but don't know the power, position or value of them. 

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Build stuff while playing is one of the characteristics I like the most in games;
- The puzzle aspect works well and allows for some tough decisions;
- Building is puzzly, but has no time pressure.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Almost zero interaction between players: it only happens in the moment of taking machine parts, and is all done by speed, it isn't even an auction;
- Big downtime: there are rounds when you won't take a machine part, and you will have to wait while others are trying to make the machine they took work inside their factories;
- Goes from fun to less fun: as the play went on, though the puzzle gets harder, the fun gets lower, simply because, in several rounds, players just won't do a thing; as the factory will only be able to receive some exact type of machine, otherwise will be too costly to put;
- Hard to track everything that was done in a turn: sometimes I had to take out, move, add and so on, in several parts of my factory, to the point that, once I was near done, I had trouble counting the costs of everything I had done, simply because I couldn't remember precisely if I did or didn't move/rotate/add/etc something. It gets worse when you start something, see it won't work, then have to reset and start again (adding more downtime to others), as I might add in my math something I did in my first try, but didn't in the second.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
In the spaceship factory of HAL 9000. "Sorry, Tiago, you can't do that" - I could even hear that neutral passive-agressive voice while I was trying to warp space in order to fit a machine part in my factory. Then the buzzer rang: Bééé. "You aren't allowed." Move over there, change some connections... Bééé. "You aren't allowed." One output wasn't covered. Or one input. Or would simply cost me more money than I had. I couldn't even store it.

In other words: [thing=24417][/thing] gives the factory, but not really the fun. The rules work well for what they intended, but I didn't found much in entertainment.

For around 3 or 4 (of the 10) rounds in the game, I wasn't doing something fun. I was staring at some pieces, trying to mentaly put them in my factory, rotating then in my head, all to see if they would fit somehow. Most wouldn't, some would, but would also cost me more then they would provide, so why bother? Why, indeed. And I didn't. Then I watched while more brave players battle with the puzzle in an effort to fit the machine they took. Some failed. Some were successful. There is a feel of accomplishment when you are able to fit a machine nicely, late in game, either because you left a proper space, waiting for a part, or because you made a good connection, earning some juicy bonus points.

Still, I much prefer games that start slow, restrained, with few options. Then, as the play went on, more and more options arise. The game gains momentum, and players are able to do lots of stuff. Think like in [thing=31260][/thing], in which you start with a small set of actions to do, and by the end, you have dozens of them, not only on the board, but in improvements and occupations. Or start with a village in [thing=77130][/thing] defended with sharp sticks and ending with an empire with tanks.

The type of games such as [thing=24417][/thing], that restrain players more and more, are good in forcing players to make hard decisions, but this can also happen even if you have lots of options. The most unique part of this decision is to make the end game feel like anticlimax, in which the high point to you was in round 7 when you fit perfectly a machine part - in the last 3 you just passed.

Therefore, [thing=24417][/thing] will feel like a slog in its final leg, and more likely than not will end with a sigh, not a bang.

Never played the Cwali edition, but finally tried Z-Man. It's more of a puzzle than a game, the only player interaction is grabbing which machine you want to build. Still, I like it!

I often look for games that are unique or that represent a different kind of gaming.  I got this game because it has a little of both.  I do have some other "puzzle" type games, and I have other "grab it first" games, but this seems to have the best of both.  I seem to be really bad at timed puzzle games, like Ricochet Robots.  In this game, the real time part is in the factory part selection, but the optimizationb part of the game isn't timed, so my normal problems aren't so bad.  It won't be a game I'll play all the time, but I like it better than the somewhat similar games I've tried.

This is a tile placing game with a few twists. First off its kind of 4 player solitaire which is usually a bad thing but it works in this case.  Players do interact once per turn.  Each player has 4 stacks of tiles, with one hand they turn over the top tile and with the other they race to pick the tile they want of the exposed tiles.  After that it becomes a puzzle solving problem, how to place the tile so it gets the proper inputs and so that the output feeds the right input(s).  A fun game I played very poorly.  I think it's one of those games you have to play several times to truly get the most out of it.  I suspect my rating will inch up as I get more experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very unique.  It's a very simple system, and takes almost no time to explain the rules.  The spatial puzzle placement is a treat, and something that feels more reminiscent of lighter puzzle video games, or science-museum style brainteasers, but that is oddly unknown in board game format.  The timing aspect adds a huge temptation to grab the piece you want, but you may not actually be able to integrate it successfully into your layout.  I very much enjoy this title, and I wonder why there aren't more like it.

Grab tiles and build an increasingly complicated machine. The real time tile grabbing aspect I was worried about didn't seem to matter as much as I thought. The puzzle-y part of arranging and re-arranging your machines was pretty fun. Despite my generally being quite bad at spatial games, I somehow managed to win this one during our play at bgg.con.

(After only one 4P play)  This is one game that I would like to give a 2nd chance before I am too critical.  It is a bit of a puzzle game that didn't "click" with me throughout the entire game.  Perhaps a 2nd play would help me in the tile selection portion.   It might not, but I'll give it a shot.

Fun, shortish, puzzle type game. It has little in the way of interaction, but the quick grab each round for components is clever (and usually isn't too frustrating -- you're far too busy trying to quickly assess tiles to notice that the player to your left has roundly hosed you by taking exactly the tile you need).

Players attempt to build the most successful factory to produce the best products by connecting input and output reservoirs smartly to your machines to build the most profitable factory!
\13\\13\
Players each start with a unique empty factory floor with a support pillar in the middle. During the game you purchase machines to place in your factory. Each machine takes 1 to 3 inputs from reservoirs (yellow, blue, red, and brown) and produces one output (of the same colors, or black end products). You must always connect all reservoirs and machines correctly by using the connectors (the pipelines). At the start this is easy, but becomes more puzzling during the game.
\13\\13\
Players start with one of each color reservoir, and can sometimes acquire additional reservoirs. On the machine-tiles you see the revenue of each machine. Connecting machines to each other (input on output) makes more advanced products which brings extra profit. But building connectors and reservoirs costs money and you must try to have the most money at the end.

The mechanics are pretty easy to grasp. However, each new turn (of 10) has the players working to incorporate new motors into their design. And selecting from the pool of new motors is 'how fast can you make a choice and grab.' The effort to add the new motors with minimal ability to plan was not suited to my style.

Nice and puzzly, and nice components as well. Probably needs some sort of formal time restriction in the placement phase, but plays pretty fast if you just help each other when stuck. Fair bit of luck, but that's probably better than the opposite.

Fun game, but too much real time decision making for my taste

Update: Why play this when you can play Galaxy Trucker instead?

Very challenging. Similar to other speed pattern recognition games but different because you need to also have a model for your flow and not just immediate connections.

This was a quick light puzzle style game.  It reminds me of a lighter version of Galaxy Trucker without meteors crashing into your factory.

I have played this once with the kids and they had a great time.  It's still a little involved for them so we play sort of free-form.  They can grab whatever they want and we don't play for points.  They are happy to put their factory together to show they can do it.  Strategy can wait.

It took place in a factory, and it was fun.  This game delivers.

fun but frustrating, especially when making the decision whether to grab a machine or not.  can also go down a wrong road when trying to move a machine.  maybe with practice, it will get better.

I'm not a great spatial thinker so this one is tough for me, but a lot of fun making colored goo go where you want/need.

When I was told you grab the piece you want and just use it on your turn I thought it was a joke. This game is no joke. Jokes are fun. This game is not.

It's like more mathy Galaxy Trucker. Every turn you try to optimize your factory, move your machines, calculate is it profitable for you. A lot of 'factory' and little 'fun'

A deceptively tough tile placement game, made especially harder by the harsh penalty incurred if you cannot optimally utilize the various machines you've picked up.  As always luck has a big effect in how well one performs, however, some of the randomness can be mitigated by simply refusing ones you cannot use to your advantage.  I'm on the fence right now in terms of its replayability, but will need more exposure to make the determination.

Fun puzzle game. Maybe the best one I've played. I don't like it's speed aspect, but I can understand the logic behind it.

After 2+ Plays: This game feels very different from anything else I've played.  It is a strange mix of frantic action and meticulous planning that I really enjoy.

I've played this enough that I don't hate it now.  It's a game that, the more you play, the easier it gets to quickly decide what piece to build.

Love love love this game, but the wife is not as big a fan as me so I don't get to play it as much as I would like.

Simple, nice game. The speed component is not too impossible, so I tolerate this game.

An awesome, puzzle-like game that tends to split its audience into love or hate; few seem to just think it's "okay".

I obviously fall into the former camp, but that's not to say the game is perfect. I have a problem with the ability to reconstruct everything by paying to rip up and move the machines. The calculations involved in this aren't reasonable, and once things start moving, it's hard to reset to the starting point.

Other than that - brilliant.

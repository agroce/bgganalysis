Sigh.  I really wanted to like this one, but after a couple plays, it really boils down to nothing but a tug-of-war.  Whoever has to waste a turn to draw a card first will probably fall behind in whatever big state is being battled over.  A disappointment since I was hoping for 1960-lite.

RATING: 6.5
A streamlined cardgame version of 1960, the goal here is to win the 2008 election.  The gameplay (which is 2P only unfortunately) involves an initial deck-building (there are several cards in each deck, with only a small portion used each game for variability), followed by card-driven play where players try to win key states through an influence/majority placement system.  There are several important items on each state: preset blue voters (for Obama), preset red voters (for McCain), undecided voters, economic/military issues, and key voter groups.  Also each state has varying point values.

The cards do several different things, from increasing voter presence, to changing the issues, to gaining more cards, to acquiring valuable undecided votes, to influencing the media.  The two different player decks are fairly similar, although there are differences, and as well the flavour text is obviously different.  Plus the player's decks will differ substantially depending on how they built them.  The states appear to well distributed in terms of preset votes and issues, and they readily winnable by either player.  Obama starts with a small head start, while McCain has a slight starting edge on more states with respect to preset voters.

The scoretrack is cool in that you fill it up with won states (they're double-sided red and blue) and they vary in size depending on their point total.  When a state is won, a new state is chosen to come into play by the winner and an event (ZNN instead of CNN) comes into play.  This is probably the one aspect I'm not a big fan of, as the events range from totally irrelevant and useless to just plain lopsided for one player over another and they come into play randomly.  A minor blemish on an overall great game.  It's very accessible (and thematic), replayable, and fun.  One of my wife's favourite games, and probably my favourite 2P only game (not generally a fan of these 2P only games, but this is a real exception).  Recommended.

RATING: 8.25
Plays in about an hour at the outside... fast-paced, has a deck-building mechanic, and requires some intelligent state selection and perhaps a little bluffing (you have a "Women" demographic card, so picking a state which defaults to "Women" is inviting your opponent to change it... perhaps you go the other way and pick one with "Seniors" hoping your opponent changes it to "Women").

I was not fond of either candidate, I don't particularly like the subject matter, but that does NOT stop me from enjoying this as a wonderful game! Nice job to Jason, Christian, and Zev for bringing this to all of us!

I like the theme and the solution for book keeping very much. However, the problem is that the deck you build is just too small to keep you interested for more than a couple of rounds. I'd like to see a more dynamic deck and some situations where you have to choose between immediate benefit and longer term strategies. Situations where you have to choose an avenue knowing that there is no turning back.

I think I have never been so frustrated with a game. My husband is the smarter one.. but usually we are not that far apart when loosing or winning. Still, I don't usually get mad for loosing a game, but for some reason, when I loose on this one, it's always with a huge difference of points, and I always end up hating it and my husband at the end. I thought the game was imbalanced and then we changed sides... he still beat me pretty hard. FRUSTATING! He is so much better!! Now it's a matter of pride to play this game until I can destroy him! I kind of like this feeling... but at the same time, it makes me feel horrible after loosing. So I am not sure if I like this game or if I hate it...

Avoid the default decks.  The default decks are essentially identical, with shifts of issue/demographic.

Two good card game players will tend to turn this into a very dull and long near-tie.  Deck building is an ok concept, but actual play is a back-and-forth that (given competence) tends towards luck dominating.  Too bad.

A tight card-driven area control-esque game.  The deck building and Breaking News mechanics work to prevent the game from feeling stale.  The components all look great and each card is unique in a way (with flavor post-its helping to accentuate theme).  Fun, strategic, tactical, and plays under an hour.

Anaise loves this game. I am terrible at this game. It is a fun game to take to a cafe and it usually gets people looking at it curiously. The deck building element keeps each game fresh however the two decks aren't that different. Florida and Ohio do seem to be key (funny that).

After more plays I have got a lot better especially when played without the pre made decks. The deck building start up is the best way to play and is not as one sided as some people think because the decks are almost identical.

RATING: 4
I was sincerely surprised when I didn't at least like this game.  Most of it kinda felt like playing the issues in 1960, which I find to be the most boring part of that generally enjoyable game.  I found that the theme was in names and flavor text here, rather than in the cards.  The decks are extremely similar, and while I enjoy the drafting mechanic it seems unusually crippling to be forced to discard bombs if you draw them in a cluster.  I think this is a genuinely good idea for a game, just didn't care much at all for the specifics of its execution.

RATING: 6.5
Not having played 1960, I can't compare these two. CM 2008, however, is a light, but interesting game of mostly outguessing your opponent: from the deck building excercise at the beginning of the game, to the turn-by-turn sense of "what's he going to do now?". Cards seem well balanced, and there's usually a price to pay for playing on one particular state while disregarding the others.

That said, the game is a bit chaotic for my tastes. While there's a great sense of "take that" that can be enjoyable even on the receiving end, luck does seem to dictate most of the outcome of the game. It's a great experience, but I'm not that sure my decisions really reflect the outcome of the game.

RATING: 6.5
Nice design.  A smaller game than I was expecting after 1960.  The introductory game did not do it any favours, although it was probably down to the media cards that came up which were heavily Obama biased, and the blues won easily.  But second game very tight and enjoyable, all hinging on Florida.  Happy to own.

The theme is intriguing, and one of the authors - Jason Matthews - is one I keep watching for future releases. So I had to try this game.

RATING: 3
First the good:  I like the theme, the cards are nicely designed and the components are great.

Unfortunately, the game is just not great, bordering on broken.  After about 7 plays I'm convinced there is only one deck to build, the card recursion/cycling deck.  Any veteran CCG player would need maybe one or two plays to see that this deck will be more consistent than any other.  Was it really the designers intention that you should be able to draw your whole deck into hand and keep most of it there for 3/4 of the game or more?  

Perhaps more of an issue is that the two sides have nearly identical cards, and there seems to be very little variance in play.  Sure, I can make a demographics "deck", and it may even work against a new player or luck into a win every 8-10 games, but why when I know how to build a deck that wins 80% of the time (and this may be an under-estimate) I would love to be wrong about this, and I will join others here in asking for a decklist to compete with recursive draw.  Until then, I will not be playing again.

I find the ZNN cards too random.  We didn't draft, so I imagine that the game is more interesting than my first session in which we played with nearly identical cards.  I'm not a big fan of filler.  I'd much rather spend the time setting up a game of Twilight Struggle.

Played on Yucata.de - really like it.  There are times when I think its a tiny bit on the dry side or there is not enough variety and I am concerned it plays a little long but lots of interesting choices and a decent amount of theme.  Good mix of drafting, area control, hand management etc.  shame this wasnt more widely loved and we could have had all sorts of great games using this system.  However I do have some concerns about the power of a drawing deck and the power of the drafting seem a bit skewed.  Still lots of fun left to be had with this game.

Played once and really wanted the game to end after 4 rounds owing to the apparent futility. The card draw seems to be the entire game, I see little choice or variation. If you like Twilight Struggle I guess you might see something to like here. Unless I have missed something fundamental, this is a lighter than air experience where the turn of the card will decide the winner. A nothing game and never again.

2 player election card game that works surprisingly well. Go right into selecting your cards for your deck as opposed to using the base game only cards.

A little gimmicky I know, but still cool.

Nice combination of a drafting game with a tug of war cardgame. The theme is well implemented but just not that interesting. The 2008 elections certainly don't have the same historical appeal as the 1960 elections. Gameplay is very tactical and there's also a fair bit of randomness involved with the breaking news cards. This can be forgiven however as this game is a rather quick filler anyway. It seems play could get repetitive pretty quickly. So I'm not sure about replayability yet. But all in all a good quick game.

Only played on Yucata.de so far. Tough learning curve because this game is largely in the draft, which occurs right at the start of the game. If you don't draft well you are playing a long, losing game from the start.

That being said, once you have got beyond that this is a nice, tight, 2p game without too much luck associated.

I love Twilight Struggle and 1960, so I thought I'd enjoy a lighter, quicker card-driven game from the same designer, but this game is just boring. There's not much variation in the cards' actions, and I didn't feel like I really had all that many options most of the time. It's the same decision over and over again. I played with the beginner setup the first time and thought I'd try it again with the other cards, but I looked through them, and it doesn't seem like they contain anything all that different that would make enough of a difference in the gameplay.

Unfortunately, this game didn't live up to the high expectations I had prior to its publication. While still being a good game, it cannot match both Twilight Struggle and 1960. Unfair comparison to almost any game out there, of course. The components are of amazing quality, however, only the scoring tiles are a little fiddly. Due to the short play time this might hit the table quite often.

RATING: 5.5
An okay 2p game of card drafting, hand management, and area control.  Realistically, the game comes down to outlasting the cards-in-hand of the other player when battling for a state and taking advantage when your opponent has few cards in hand.  A small hand of cards (or zero cards) makes you vulnerable because you probably cannot win a state or slow/stop the other guy... and you become heavily dependent on luck of the draw since you can only draw one card per turn to refill your hand.  The powerful cards are made tame by giving a bonus to your opponent.  All of this adds up to the game having a tug-of-war feeling... I win a state and become weak due to a small hand size, then you win a state by playing a bunch of cards because I'm busy refilling my hand, and then I pounce on another state which you cannot defend due to low hand size, and so on.

The basic 15 card decks for learning the game are pretty lame.  They contain lots of cards for changing the top issue (defense vs. economy) or demographics, and too few cards that give votes.  This can lead to a long/slow game with lots of turns spent drawing cards to try to find the voter cards.

First game was a nice intro to the mechanics, but the 2 starter decks are basically mirror images of each other. 

Second game shows how well this game shines. Drafting is fun and really gives the game a custom feel. I imagine the game will just become better after each play reveals possibilities for more finely tuned campaign ideas.

Great components of good quality. Nice art and easy to teach. My biggest complaint is the scoring track. I like the idea, but it's a little fiddly.

Inital rating based on one play. Like this - feels a bit like a lighter/streamlined to the extreme 1960.

Like the deck draft idea, heck like all of it at the moment - but once I know the cards it will either shine or the shine come off. I suspect certain deck types will become dominant (of course you can't guarantee to draft the same deck each time if 2 of the cards you want appear together ...)

I used this game solely to try and gauge my wife's possible interest in 1960:  The Making of the President.  I always wanted to play 1960 but was afraid it would be too heavy for her.  This one has a similar premise and is from the same designer, but it is much lighter.  It's an average game, but it served its purpose as we did eventually purchase and enjoy 1960.  On its own I don't see a lot of staying power though.

I suspect my rating will improve after a couple more plays.

Nice game that can teach one about the ebb and flow of the american electoral colllege.

The introductory game has a pre-set pair of card decks that allow various changes to each differing states majority/minority issue.

There are extra cards to change up the decks once you learn the rules and players each get to have a crack at trying to figure out how to best affect the election outcome.

RATING: 5
I'd rate the base game a 6, and the draft game an 8.  Gives you the feeling of 1960, with the biggest difference being the drafting mechanism.  The game IS the deck you draft, the rest is going through the motions.

Oh, and I love the theme.

EDIT: After playing it a lot, there is an optimal strategy in facilitating card draw, and the ability to "hoard" your deck seems so broken.  Takes away from the game for me.

Theme is a total drag for me, I'm just not that interested in American Politics.

However - the gameplay is thoroughly excellent.  The deck building system is quick, but provides a neat strategy and 'feel' to each Candidate, the battling over issues and demographics is interesting as well.  Really needs at least one play to click I think.  A solid game.  Despite my general disinterest in the theme, this is a game I am happy and looking forward to playing again - can't say better than that really - well, I could have said I died from the sheer magnificence of it, but then it brought me back to life and here I am goggle-eyed and raving about it - but then you'd have to question my sanity.

I wish the theme was about two private enterprise companies vying for funding from various companies/grant/governments for a Space Tourism venture.  Maybe that's just me though :D

I used to say "I like all games". Well... here comes the 1st exception :D OK, I talk with only 2 plays but all the strategy seems to be reduced to: take as many "draw one card" cards as possible in the draft, then try to reach 12 cards in hand, and finally don't stop playing cards tha give you one more back.

You're doing the same thing over and over again, it doesn't allow for interesting play really, and only a few interesting decisions.

The introductory version of this game plays like a simplified and turbo-charged Die Macher crossed with 1960: The Making of the President.  It's admittedly not as good as that makes it sound but I look forward to trying out the full game, as drafting your hand of tactics cards would seem to give scope for not only variety between games but a good deal of tactical options which the intro game only hints at.

RATING: 6
I've definitely enjoyed this one, much moreso than 1960 and Twilight Struggle, just because the length is finally, truly, more or less under control given what the game is, and the game balance is there. It's still a touch long, but it generally produces interesting and tight game.

The downside of the game is that getting these basic things right has come at a huge cost in terms of theme. The decks and even the states are quite limited in range and completely symmetrical and so pretty flavorless. When you play the Pillar vs. the Vulca in Blue Moon, you know you are playing two different factions with two different approaches. The only thing that tells you this in Campaign Manager is the pictures. Campaign Manager is a fun game, but it's obviously a very simplistic design when compared to euros like Blue Moon, Jambo, or Catan Card Game. But, you know, those are top tier games by professional designers. There is room in my game space for a fun, lighter game like Campaign Manager. But it's just not anywhere close to being in the same league as the euros in this space.

Funny, when this first came out, which was only about 6 months ago at this writing, I still felt like it was too soon - the 2008 elections generated a lot of ill feeling for me. But now, I'm OK, and Campaign Manager lightly pokes fun at things and doesn't take itself too seriously. It's the Twilight Struggle "history as photo album", not any kind of serious attempt to evoke the flavor of the 2008 campaign. Thankfully. It means the game suffers for a lack of theme, but it also spares us any level of reliving an experience that, for many people, was not a whole lot of fun. At this point, apparently, I can see a picture of Joe the Plumber and laugh light-heartedly.

RATING: 7
I think a lot of people are going to be looking for another 1960 or Twilight Struggle here, and those people might be disappointed.  However, I thought this was a very fun and fairly light game that does a pretty cool job of depicting the 2008 elections.

My first play was just with the recommended beginner decks, but I suspect the game will really shine when we do the deck building next time around.  My only concern was that there didn't seem to be a great variety of cards, and a 15 card deck gets a little repetitive over the course of a campaign.  Playing with the card draft greatly improves the game play though, as you are never sure what's in your opponent's deck!

Overall, this is a very accessible, tense, and fun political game that I think is going to garner a lot of appeal!

RATING: 4

I wanted to like the design. I feel there are a fair number of really clever approaches to doing a presidential election game in there.

But the bland deck with its no-brainer choices simply doesn't work. Let's face it: It's broken. Clearly the demographics-related dimension was supposed to be a major part of the game, yet the broad consensus among us is that taking a demographics-centric approach is simply not competitive. Those cards suck. And then there's the mega-hand issue on top of that.

The designers are really gifted, yet I feel their closed-shop playtesting has now repeatedly left their designs not meet their inherent promise.

Consider 1960: The issues tit-for-tat is simply inevitable among those who know what they're doing. It soaks up almost all the energy and leads to pretty stale gameplay. As a result, the game has really falled considerably in its popularity.

CM could have been a great and very replayable game. There's a lot of promise in the basic design ideas, but they're marred by poor execution. CM really cries out for a variant overhaul.

RATING: 4
Had an interesting basic concept (a CDG where you draft cards prior to play) that might have worked in a more substantial game; the problem was that CM 2008 felt too far removed from the actual business of campaigning for President, and some of the actual card effects felt unbalanced and consequently the game felt a bit underdeveloped.

Also: it's a mite ridiculous to make a simulation-ish game out of an election that really wasn't actually terribly competitive or close. It's less of a ridiculous idea than Campaign Manager 1984 or 1972 or 1964, but c'mon man. McCain got trucked in '08 and he was never not getting trucked in '08. Stick with 1960 -- same designer, much better game.

This is a much better game than 1960.  There is some symmetry in the decks, but the initial deck-drafting creates replayability and diversity that other games lack. It also plays quickly. 

These type of 2-player games are not ones I find a need to play that often, but when I do I think this one works very well.  Personally, I prefer something longer and more complicated (more like Twilight Struggle in this genre), but I'll happily play Campaign Manager if its requested.

RATING: 6
There aren't a ton of fun, strategic two player games, but Campaign Manager is one of them. It's basically the junior, child version of 1960 -- for instance, you only are contesting the battleground states, not the whole country. This time, it's Obama vs McCain, and the key is the deck of 45 cards for each side. The fundamental flaw of the game is that it's deck-building -- you build a deck of 15 cards and play only those same cards over and over. This gets repetitive, and I've played the game with the full deck just fine. The cards reference events that occurred in the 2008 campaign, and you simply follow the instructions on the card.

RATING: 7.25
As you've probably read, this is a lighter and less complicated version of 1960.  Once again you have a battle of cards where you try to gain marginal advantage in various states to claim them for your side for the election.  The difference here is that you win over a state on one of two issues - Defense or Economy - and when you've convinced enough voters you "win" that state immediately.

The plus side to this game is that it moves along quickly and is just easier to digest than its predecessor.  The downside is I don't like the deck-building aspect at the start of the game which can cripple a newer player that doesn't know better.  Also there is a risk of a protracted battle over the last state if the game was evenly matched up to that point.  But overall this is a nice implementation of a theme.

Haven't had the chance to play this but twice, but it already feels as if play will continue to be somewhat n the dull side.  There is little in the way of distinguishing characteristics between the candidates, save for the tired go-to of modify votes and such.  The decks are essentially identical, as  if the designer wanted to make a card game about the election without hurting anyone's feelings.

We played Campaign Manager with the introductory rules.  It was a nice way to jump in and see the good parts of the game.  If you do this don't forget that there is more depth in the game if you draft your own deck and starting states.  That has interested for me, but I would probably not want to play another game with the intro rules.  My only concern is that it was a bit long.  But then again our score was 270 to 266.  So that added to the length for us.  Fun game & good with the right opposition.

I bought this due to the fact one of the creators also made 1960: Making of the President. It's a fun game as well. Much simpler and not nearly as in depth. It's a fun one to pull out to show someone a two player only game but it doesn't get out often.

The card-drafting system in this game is very clever, but it can make for a blowout if one person's deck is strictly inferior to the other's, which can be discouraging.  But it's short enough and simulative enough that it shouldn't be alienating.

RATING: 6
I love the idea of deck construction for something that doesn't involve wizards, magical creatures, or planes of existence. Elves -- I can't STAND them! Naturally, constructing a deck around card advantage is a very obvious strategy, but I am dismayed by claims it's the only viable strategy and that it leads to quasi-stalemates. Fortunately, worst reports of brokenness have not been experienced by me, though it seems that the penalties for Negative Campaigning are too high to be sustained and running a demographic strategy has too much of a Rube Goldberg quality to often work -- I'll ding the grade of what otherwise would have been an outstanding game.

Multiple plays have partially erased some of my concerns. Yes, a deck filled with cantrips can be overwhelming, but one has to be very fortunate during deck construction to put together an over powered deck. Negative Campaigning cards of the type that immediately give two support in a single issue disrupt your opponent's planning and help break potential stalemates, although other types of Negative cards are ineffective. The Demographic sub-game remains clunky and is best avoided as far as possible.

Topicality of game has eroded its appeal for me.

I wrote a review on this game here: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/466875.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Players represent the campaign managers for McCain and Obama during the 2008 US presidential campaign.  Ultra simple card game where players can either draw a card from their 15 card mini-deck into their hand, or play a card to influence the outcome in one of four current states.  States are won and electoral seats are awarded, and a new state enters the game.  Essentially a game of card play and jinking markers around, but wrapped up in a nice theme, some good game play, and lovely production values (although that score track is a pain ... great idea, but a pain).  It reminded me a little of Blue Moon, not quite as brilliant, but still very nice.  Good stuff.  (Proceed straight to the drafting game, too!).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
You customize a 15-card deck and vie for various states in the US election, though at any given time four states are up for grabs. Involves hand management, timing, weighing payoffs, and more. 

A satisfying little CCG-lite. Scarab Lords tried this idea years ago, but no one has really tried it again due to the Dominion phenomenon.

Hmmm ... a little conflicted about this game. It's simple, quick, easy to play. It's got a catchy theme, the card depict memorable events and I enjoy playing the game.

If I compare with TS and 1960, this is probably the best incarnation - cutting away the crap, the extraneous stuff and keeping it simple. Cutting down on the playing time was the best thing that was done.

But ... compared to other euros, it's just so-so.

It's probably too simplistic to warrant a lot of plays, even with the card drafting. It's just play cards to put/remove markers, move stuff around. Card abilities are very generic and same-same. And while there's been some who compare this to Blue Moon, CM 2008 will not be as rich as Blue Moon for one reason - there are no prospects of changing the card decks (I may be pleasantly surprised if there are expansions.)

1/6/10  Awesome!  I was talking about Campaign Manager 2008 to my non-gamer wife and she said "I would try that out".

5/18/10  Only 2 people @ game night tonight. Started with an interesting prototype with a wacked-out theme. Finished with Campaign Manager: very fun.

5/18/10  I definitely want to play Campaign Manager again without the preconstructed decks and I'm looking forward to Founding Fathers even more now.

8/17/10  We then continued the political theme with a 2-player Campaign Manager 2008. It's much more fun with the card drafting, but I still lost.

8/21/10  The scoretrack in Campaign Manager 2008 is cool but not very functional, so I made one for EveryGame on the iPad/iPhone.

8/21/10  @brettspiel You drag the states up to Obama or McCain when they are won and it keeps track of the score.   http://tweetphoto.com/40315964

RATING: 7
Quick and simple game supposedly with design problems regarding recursive draw decks. You build a deck that will have to last you the whole game, during which you'll discover and react to your opponent's deck. The hidden information keeps things moving yet tense, as you will have to execute an easily-foiled plan over several moves. I like the game, but no one wants to play it with me!

Duration: Wonderfully short, keeping your attention throughout.
Design: Clean, elegant rules, clean card effects.
Strategy: Despite the simplicity, there's a lot going on! The strategy space will be exhausted after a few dozen plays (more than other short games I enjoy), but those will be great games.
Components: Robust, appealing components. People complain about the voting track, but I like it.
Theme: Arguably there is less thematic integration with the card effects, but the Electoral College votes, state demographics, issues, and art/graphic design are very well done.

The recursive draw deck causes the game's strategy space to degenerate.

RATING: 7
[6 plays] This is my current favorite quick and accessible 2 player game.  It pushes you to think long-term and short-term at the same time in terms of your advantages vs. the other player's deck, where you are in your current deck cycle, and where your own advantages are.  

Each action you have is, overall, worth "1 point."  As in, you draw a card and then play a card which does two things (say, gain a support and shift an issue) yielding an average of one thing accomplished per action.  The "Do 1 thing and draw a card" cards are efficient in that you never waste a second thing on your card, but they're slow when you need the most dense action plays in a certain amount of time for winning the big states (which is what the game is all about).  The demographic cards which sway undecided voters are extremely efficient, but are very difficult to play and become useless as those states are decided.  The "draw 3 cards" and media cards are probably the most efficient cards in the game, but they do require you to completely stall for a turn.  I really don't understand the draw deck complaints, at all.  Each card has it's strengths and weaknesses.  

All of that card tension goodness revolves around the tempo of the states and the media cards.  When you bring out the big states, the small states, the states with specific key demographics, it all depends on the current situation.  I get a very satisfying hand management feel out of the game which is really refreshing to see in something so simple on the surface.  Well done, guys.

RATING: 4.5
It's easy to draft a deck that lets you slowly draw and keep in hand almost all your cards, which means being able to counter anything your opponent does, as you always have the card you need in hand.

This either produces a tie, a game decided by dice rolls (of the attack cards) or an extremely prolonged game (if one of the two players was unlucky enough to have a defective deck due to unfortunate grouping of the best cards during the draft).

Absolutely not recommended, unless you houserule it.

RATING: 7
Interest tug-of-war over 4 states at a time, using a pre-built deck of 15 cards each (out of 45 total for each side).  The way scores are kept on the scoring track is ingenious!  The decks are not really asynchronous, but there are still some interesting decisions to be made.  It almost feels like a slightly more complicated version of Balloon Cup.

I love election games, and this one is pretty cool.  But with only 15 cards, you end up using the same cards over and over again.  How many times can Oprah make such an impact?  Seems quite a few.   I play this game a lot at www.yucata.de

If you don't draft a deck that maximizes hand size, the folks at yucata will usually crush you.  A serious limitation in the game that is addressed by using the pre-constructed decks.

Campaign Manager is a small drafting game about the 2008 US presidential elections. First, players draft their campaign decks then throw them at each other in order to become the next president.

The game is interesting enough on first play. I'm unsure about the long-term appeal, however. The cards are all variations of the same basic set of actions (gain support, shift issue, change demographic, draw card), and there is no asymmetry in the different parties. It's hard to come up with resourceful or unexpected ways to use those actions.

The artwork and production by Z-Man are top notch.  Distills the essence of 1960 into a much faster playing game.   The learning game cards are a bit boring (necessarily so in order to learn the game) and I am looking forward to seeing how the card drafting works over a several games.  I am a bit concerned that the game maybe overly balanced and that the two card decks are essentially identical.

RATING: 7
I know there are infinite draw loops that can break the game, but there are variants to help with that.

Otherwise, this "fixes" everything I didn't like about 1960.  No more pointless moving around the map playing tug of war, back and forth, over the most lucrative states.  Now, you have only four states in play at a time, and there is more than just 1-for-1 tug of war going on.

Also, no endless battling over the issues track.  And no needlessly stretching this gameplay out over 2 hours...2008 wraps up the same in a half-hour.

The theme of 1960 is leagues better than this one, admittedly 2008 was one of the least dramatic elections ever (did anyone really think old man McCain had a chance?)  But the gameplay here?  Crisp, and fun.

For what is essentially a deck building game Campaign Manager 2008 is a really basic and dull one.  The cards are largely uninteresting as is the game play.  It often seems to boil down into a simple tug of war, but instead of tension rising repetition does instead.

Seems it was designed to cash in on the historical moment.  Seems it's destined to be history in my games rotation.

Dumbed down version of '1960: The Making of the President' some say. Maybe so. And maybe not.

If you enjoy the games like Twilight Struggle but don't have 2-3 hours to play, Campaign Manager is one of the best choices you can make.

The lenght of a game was achieved in very simple way - add some randomness and start the game from the middle. And - surprisingly - it works!

I like it and will probably play it more often than both abovementioned titles. It's just shorter and yet challenging and satysfying.

First Play March 2010 - Decent 2-player Euro.  But I couldn't help but feel that the theme is pasted on.  There is flavour in the cards, but I rarely even read them, focusing on the effect rather than the "event".  This, and the shuffling, gave me a few Dominion flashbacks.  But, CM2008 is far superior in that it is completely interactive. 7/10.  The single die, each rolling 4-6 times per game can inflict a biased random element, along with the Breaking News/Media.  15 card deck almost feels too small, I hate shuffling 10 cards...

After a less than stellar single play, this game sat on my shelf for quite a while. With a game purge looming I needed a second play to decide its fate. 

This is a keeper. I think it is unfairly maligned and under appreciated for a couple reasons. 

1) People were expecting another game like 1960 and almost became insulted when a light card game was in the box. This game deserves to be judged for what it is, not compared to 1960.

2) when Zman got bought out all their recent games got sold off cheap. Too bad for a few of these titles as the perception of them was ruined due to the "bad game" discount price stigma.

It's a bad game really.  I was glad to trade it away.  The problem is that the cards are all very similar, and usually you give up a state to gain a different state.  There is some interesting interactions, but nothing to write home about.  A miss...

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A pretty good game that has good interaction and plays pretty quickly. The cards are amusing because of the detail from the recent election, but I wonder if in the future it will seem historical or just dated.

I appreciated having the "beginner" option for set up, but I think it takes a lot out of the game. The next time I teach it, I'll probably play open-handed until one state is taken, then start over again with the regular rules. It's important to understand the game and know what the cards can do before you are forced into the drafting.

What 1960 should be. Tug of war, but you actually get to see how you are doing during the game. Only complaint is that cards that draw cards are a bit too strong and the game is tad too long when played irl. Yucata implementation is very nice.

RATING: 3
On the plus side, this game is accessible and is usually a very tense tug-of-war game. Unfortunately, that tug-of-war just isn't very interesting due to being overly balanced to the point where the result ultimately feels like drawing lots.

The theme is also diminished by overly-balanced design as the sides are barely asymmetrical. It's also probably not the most interesting U.S. Presidential Election to put into a board game - recreating Obama versus McCain hasn't proved to be much a draw in my experience.

It is a noble attempt to make a realistic political game that anyone can learn and win, but it ends up being a bland experience.

Winning (or losing) states was exciting, but not the process of getting there.  Didn't quite come together as I had hoped.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (April 2011)

Not a bad game but not one I want to play often. The game itself has very simple rules and it also has a decent amount of luck. What I really like is the draft mode, as you only play with 15 cards the game has a high replay value, however when I have 2 players in my hands this is one of the least games that crosses my mind but I’m not sure why, perhaps it is the political theme (which I don’t enjoy).

The game components are very nice and the art is adequate but not particularly exciting. The gameplay is really simple but it has room for some strategic maneuvers. I will only play it with the draft mode, otherwise it is very boring to me.

I have played it 12 times as of today and I almost always lose so the game has to have some underground strategy I’m missing, but in general the game is not very fun. It is a shame as the ideas seemed a nice one to me.

Blasphemy alert.

Of the political games I have played, I prefer to play 1960 than this (as most players), but in enjoyment level this is on par with Twilight Struggle, another game I don’t particularly enjoy.

RATING: 5
An interesting concept, and like every Jason Matthews game I've played, stellar theme binding.

The pre-game deckbuilding seems like the best part of the game, or at least it will be once I get a chance to do it having played before.

At their heart the state-by-state battles are multiple simultaneous tugs-of-war along the Defense-Economy axis; if Obama can keep states prioritizing Economy he will generally win them and vice versa for McCain and Defense.  The supposed tension is between card flow (support cards) and card efficiency (demographics), but I'm not positive it isn't a false tension.  Demographics cards can be insanely hard to trigger for much effect, and even when they go off are fairly easy to neutralize via support.

I'll want to play a few more times.  At a minimum Campaign Manager is an inexpensive, well-produced card game that offers a fertile ground for thought-experiments about deck design in card games.  That's quite a bit even if the various strategies prove not to be fully balanced against each other.

Is a nice quick interpretation of 1960.  My first play was with the pre-set cards, will alter rating once play the drafting version.

Upon first play this seems to do what Caylus Magna Carta did for Caylus, dilution.

Campaign Manager is a lot of fun!  The ready-made decks work fine, but the real game is in the draft.  Which strategies do I want to pursue, what are the must-have cards in my deck?  CM plays quickly, is easy to learn, and is an over-all winner.  Even non-gamers pick it up quickly due to the subject matter.

I do have some criticisms, however.  Drafting strategy can seem really obvious.  Any card that immediately lets me draw 2 cards and play one of them is always going to make the cut.  The Demographic strategy feels very week compared to a strategy based around card draws.  The two campaigns have very similar card sets.  CM is not a perfect game, but it is still a pretty fun one.

After that, it is mostly playing cards from your limited hand to see how well your deck-build turned out. It's almost impossible to play this game with a new player without using the pre-constructed starting decks, which are kind of dull compared to what you could build. This means if you introduce the game to a lot of people, you'll be using that deck a lot. This game is specifically designed, it seems to me, for two people to play repeatedly and try out different combos in their decks. Even this would get a bit predictable after a while. Still, the card play is pleasant and the price is definitely right.

Nice implementation of deck-building. Not as deep as his other designs and the decks are functionally identical; however, CM is still rather thematic (I love the ZNN tracker) and it has quite a bit of tension with the states-in-play immediate scoring. It also has the added benefit of playing in 30 minutes.

A fun game centered around more current politics and taking states for electoral votes.  I really enjoy the game, and I feel it carries a nice balance of both strategy and tactics.  Due to online play, I would consider myself very experienced in this game, and yet I've still had my butt handed to me on several occasions-- even from less experienced players.  In other words, it never feels random, but is extremely variable.

A good, but not great game.

RATING: 1.5
The theme was nicely integrated into the mechanics of this one. Everything from the electoral vote scoring track to the campaign issue manipulations. I haven't played 1960 or Twilight Struggle, but, I would be more into those themes than this, and I think I would like the increased complexity. But, nonetheless I highly recommend this as an election/politics game if you want one that plays fast but thematically; one of the best politics games I've played.

UPDATE:
Dropping from 8.2 to 1.5 due to seemingly "broken" strategy of drafting all cards that allow you to add cards, so basically your deck is your hand, you have your entire deck in your hand (nearly).  I don't think this is the spirit of the game as intended by the designers (otherwise it would have been hands and not decks and they would not have had the "can't draw after 5" rule.).  Also the game becomes long and boring now b/c every move your opponent makes, you can counter it, and vice versa.

They should have done more extensive playtesting and with more diverse groups, and this issue might have come up before release.

UPDATE:
I like the pre-constructed decks mode, it's really a clever little political election game that way.  It's just unfortunate that you can't have more replay diversity because as soon as you make your own decks you get into the "recursive deck" which breaks the game.  I think with a "max cap" of cards (maybe 6?), it would be a much improved game.

RATING: 5
Jason Matthews has been slimming down and condensing each subsequent design in the last 5 years. 1960 is considerably lighter and shorter than Twilight Struggle. Campaign Manager less than half the length of 1960.

Each player fights over the battleground states from the 08 presidential election. Four states are in play at any given time. Whenever a state is won, those electoral votes go to the player, he or she chooses which state will enter play next, and a news event affects approval ratings in one of the four states. On your turn you either play a card or draw. States each have an issue spectrum with Obama campaigning on the economy and McCain campaigning on national defense. Cardplay will strengthen your position on one of these issues or shift that state's focus along the spectrum. If you can max out an issue while the public is following along, the state goes to you. You must do both though: if voters care about defense, if doesn't matter how well you're campaigning on the economy and vice versa.

There are 45 cards for each player included in the box. Only 15 per player are used each game following a draft. Replayability comes through deck-building. The design has an excellent overall shape to it but the details may tell a different story. Card-advantage is huge in this game. Of that I think there is no question. The game's viability will depend on just how dominant it is, but I'm already wary. I don't want to spend time on a game that's largely about whose deck cycles most efficiently. I've played twice and I admire the game, but my appreciation could slide in a hurry.

Update: the more I think about it, the more difficult it is for me to see how this would end up shining for me in the long-term.

I'm not sure how much there is to Campaign Manager 2008. The initial card drafting of 15 out of 45 cards defines your chances for winning but I'm not sure if there's that much strategic variety once you found out what makes a deck work. The same lacklustreness hits in card play or choosing states for the next election. There are lots of decisions but for me they lack tension.
Seeing the winning ratios of the best players at Yucata.de convinced me that the game is broken. There's a degenerate strategy for the Obama player to get all of his deck in his hand thereby allowing him to play repeatedly the cards he wants (recursive draw deck). Downgraded to 4/10.

Initial rating, with further play I could see this easily going up.

This satisfies in all the ways that 1960 did not.  The more I played 1960, the more I felt like the issues messed up the game.  I could simply not ignore the issues without getting trounced, and so the game ended up being a tedious back and forth over issues and a few key states.  I was probably not playing optimally, but to me it was frustrating just adding and subtracting cubes.

It's kind of funny, because you're essentially doing the same thing here, but the quicker play time and pared down rules set does wonder.  You're just focusing on four battleground states at a time, and the very small group of cards means that the drafting you do at the beginning is of extreme importance, and the way the cards recycle through your hand can make or break your game.

Of course, I like political themes in games, and even though thematically the game seems tilted in favor of Obama (hard not to do), it is very enjoyable and I hope to see this create the basis for a new series of election games.

RATING: 7
A card game with a board game score sheet. (or something like that)  The election is such a recent memory that the game causes you to relive it.  
It feels like the card draft at the beginning is 80% of the game.  You still have to react to the opponent and use the card effectively, but you have to have the right set of cards to begin with.

Fast playing, fun game using a card-driven mechanism.  With four states in play at once, there a lot of choices about how to play your cards and when to take states.

RATING: 4
This one dropped quite a bit and I no longer have interest in plays. Too much tactical tug of war and after a while everyone tends to draft pretty much the same set of cards if possible within each deck. 

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Need to explore this quite a bit more yet, but initial game play seems quite interesting.  Drafting your deck is definitely a key part to the game but one has to play a game to understand how everything works together to have the best idea of how to develop a deck.  It should prove interesting to try different deck building strategies in the future - I hope there isn't just one standard deckbuilding format that tends to win the whole time.

RATING: 7.5
Lighter, quicker than it's older brother 1960 while still managing to offer a good deal of the tense decisions of its sibling. Some of the cards seem like they are fairly generic in effect and I worry that the decks might get a little "samey" in feel over repeated play.

This is a well-designed game that does a good job of presenting a tight presidential race. It's lighter than Twilight Struggle and 1960, and not like either of them, but still clearly in the same "family". However, I'll be honest, I'm not looking for a game that reminds me of Sarah Palin or Joe the Plumber. I kind of wish things were a little more abstracted here. Beyond that, there are just other two-player games that fill this niche better, such as 1960 or 1955: War of Espionage.

RATING: 6
The game production is fabulous and is another hit for Z-man---everything feels very polished and slick. However, the gameplay kind of fell flat for us. The McCain and Obama decks are very similar and there are only a few basic actions that each card has variations on. Also, the deck recycling mechanism feels a little weird in this context---why do the same events keep coming out during your campaign? I wish the game was more like [thing=9446][/thing], with asymmetric decks that play differently and if you run out of cards, you run out of funding. Instead, the game feels more like [thing=36218][/thing], which we also didn't care for---the card actions feel like very basic variations of the same things as you recycle the deck over and over again. It felt very mechanical.  I guess we just don't like deck building games. Our last game, we were battling over North Carolina, with each of us adding and subtracting one support over and over again until my wife was lucky enough to be the first to draw a card that let her place two support to win the state. I can see how some people may like optimizing their deck and optimizing which state to bring in, but it just doesn't excite us. Still, the production quality and theme are nice enough that we'll probably bring this out once in a while.

[microbadge=1256][microbadge=37554]

For a game that completely abstracts the impact and drive of the 2008 election, it certainly does capture a lot of the idealism that was going on.  There are some neat ideas, and some neat gimmicks that don't effect play, but I have the feeling I've seen all of this before.  Despite this drier and older-feeling play, it's still a playable and fun game, occasionally.  I wonder how much more Twilight Struggle can be distilled; there's barely any left in this game.

This is a card driven game that has been described as a light 1960 and benefits from a shorter playing time. Definitely worth checking out!!


Some have said that the cards drive the game. However, the drawing 3 keep 1 mechanic seems very engaging.

A nice game, but definitely not worth playing while 1960 is unplayed. This also is NOT a non-gamer game especially if the non-gamers are NOT political. So, I can definitely wait before buying.Consider it for a Jan 2012 purchase unless I can find it for $10 (NB: It's available for $19 plus tax from CLS).

7/2010 Based on one game where Obama took an early lead winning Florida, eventually leading to the White House.

The game rounds are very repetitive and there are only a few different types of player cards.

Great, great, great card drafting and hand management game.  The theme is wonderful with all of the card being based on actual events from the 2008 campaign.  The score tracker looks great and is a really novel implementation though it can be a bit difficult to see exactly how many votes you still need.  It would have been nice to see the markers have both the state and the votes on them for easy tallying.  I would always be happy to pull this out.

Pretty good cardgame. I mostly bought it for the unusual theme and its pedigree, but I was pleasantly surprised at the intense 'back and forth' it provided. My brother liked it even more, even though the theme does nothing for him.

However, I suspect that this game might get old pretty fast if you play it a lot of times in a row. I also suspect that eventually you'll construct your deck on auto-pilot. It certainly does not help that both sides have almost identical cards. I suspect these things will eventually cause me to choose something like Blue Moon over this game.

RATING: 5
Game in a Nutshell: Compete for battleground states by using the a short deck of cards selected at the beginning of the game.

Two-player only.

Pros: Captures some of the magic of 1960 but in a faster more streamlined form. The designers did a good job of having the right mix of mechanics to keep things interesting, but not one too many where it becomes convoluted or unnecessary. Maybe the first game I can think of where I enjoy the open score-board due to the race aspect. 

Cons: Despite a really high initial enjoyment of the game, I discovered through play on Yucata.de a dominant strategy that sucked almost all the fun from the game. With two players that play this strategy, the game is essentially won or lost by how lucky you are in drafting your deck. All this game boils down to me now is simple tactical decisions with a little excitement from luck of the draw.

Other: I initially rated it fairly high because I really enjoyed the novelty of the mechanics along with the overall feel of the game but obviously my opinion changed. My best advice is enjoy it until you break it.

Best Use: A two player semi-quickie that might satisfy a taste for something bigger.

Quite an interesting game.  Not sure what I think about the initial downtime of deck construction before the game starts, but I guess it's all right as it works well in the end.  Some challenging decisions to make throughout, plays pretty quickly, maybe more polished than 1960.  A very good effort.

In what other game can Joseph Lieberman or the Reagan Democrats be an asset?  In what other game will Oprah Winfrey be your saving grace or downfall?  An interesting game reminiscent of the Blue Moon family of games in that you're simultaneously competing over multiple objectives (states in this case) through hand-management and a cycling deck of action cards.  The drafting mechanism was a great addition -- and probably necessary for longevity.

finally got around to trying this out and my initial thoughts after reading the rules seem to have borne out (granted, just one play).   does not seem to be that many interesting decisions and I expect the election choice to actually go stale as years pass.

with 15 card decks that get cycled a few times during the game, i just do not think there is enough variety.  cards are mostly homogenous at first glance.

would be interesting to see a 2000 variant appear down the road.

i may be a bit too harsh, but i just do not have that much interest in 2 player filler length games.

The actual play pales in comparison to the draft which in some ways makes this feel like a quick 2p asymmetric MtG draft. It probably drags on longer than it needs to, but not a bad game for its weight. It definitely cannot be judged on the starter decks.

This gets an extra point for the excellent graphic design. The gameplay however seems broken to me. If you fill your deck with 'draw again' cards and then fill your hand to near capacity it is going to be very difficult for your opponent to beat you. If both players do this you get a very drawn out war of attrition or more likely a stalemate. No thanks.

Feels like the diet coke version of Twilight Struggle or 1960. The deck building mechanic that goes on prior to each game is very unique, and it's something I think other designers should take note of. A good stepping stone towards those aforementioned games, and a decent filler otherwise.

RATING: 9
What a smart and snappy design!  On a meta level, this reminds me of one of my favorite card games: Blue Moon.  Constrained deck building resulting in specialized asymmetrical decks.  Each player then tries to mitigate what the opposing deck can do while maximizing his own potentials.

The play time and numerous easter eggs made this the gem of BGG.Con 2009 for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A pretty big disappointment. Thankfully, it plays quicker than 1960, but the gameplay is just as inert. It's missing that [i]je ne sais quoi[/i] that Matthews perfected with Twilight Struggle. Perhaps it's the lack of a defined asymmetry (the decks are essentially the same). Or that it has that same tit-for-tat feeling that 1960 has (move a cube, draw a card, your turn to do the same). 

The card titles and photos, however, are quite fun.

An enjoyable game to be sure, just felt REALLY back and forth to me.  Yes that might be what the game was trying to do, because it really does feel like a tug of war, just gets a bit repetitive for me.

This was no 1960 - but if you are looking for a bit more of a brain burning than Lost Cities provides you it might be a good one to pick up. Personally though I'd rather play the extra 30-45 minutes and play 1960.

Faço muita questão do tema do jogo ser legal. Não consigo focar só na mecânica, não dá. E por isso eu gosto do Campaign Manager 2008. Jogo de carta simples, para 2 pessoas, em que cada jogador fica no papel do coordenador de campanha de um dos dois candidatos a presidente dos Estados Unidos em 2008. O jogo parece feito para geeks de política como eu, porque as cartas representam estratégias de fato usadas nas campanhas: Obama foca na economia, McCain na defesa. Quem lida melhor com a imprensa tem vantagem, e partir para o ataque é bom, mas arriscado. Recomendo para quem curte o assunto, inclusive novatos em jogos (as regras são bem simples).

RATING: 3.5
The game looks promising, but it doesn't deliver.

There a winning strategy that, with minor variations, grants a 99% success rate, and it's so simple that it's very suprising that the designer didn't realize.

The deck building phase is the decisive part of this game. How well you play it or the luck with the drawing order are just a small factor. So, the longest part of the game is the least important one.

And it has some other problems: The cards have serious balance issues. Some cards are almost worthless (demographic) and some others are much better than the rest (the ones that allow you to draw other cards). Also, the cards lack diversity.

I was very surprised to find a 99% symetric game, because the theme asks for a completely asymetric gameplay.

It's a game I would only play from time to time, when I'm really bored. I would never consider buying it.

I think 3.5 is too high as a note, but I'll keep it because the components and the stuff are nice :P

In a few words: great ideas, bad execution.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Surprisingly, not nearly as much tug-of-war included as you'd expect. It's a lot more about clever card play, and especially about the drafting.

Being a huge fan of cards with multiple uses, I find it a bit disappointing that the cards are now used as events only. Also, the player decks are identical (or to be exact, mirrored just like the states): Only the three special cards are different. The card effects are also very simple and generic. Of course, it might very well be that all of this was really needed for dropping the game length under 45 minutes. Still, I wish the cards packed just a little more punch.

The scoring markers are a bit fiddly because the ends have not been cut properly, so some counter cleaning is necessary.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.6
Achieves what it sets out to accomplish...  it's not pitched to be as fun as 1960, but it doesn't require as much time either.  So, in a way, the fun/time ratio is about the same.  If you've got the time to play 1960, play it over this one.  However, it's nice to have this one to play when you just have 45 minutes.

A good effort overall. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
In a simulation of the 2008 elections in the USA, the McCain player and the Obama player must shape their respective decks of cards from a pool and then try to win at different states (cards as well, each with a different setup and value) by managing these cards in relatively small hands. States can be won promoting defence or economy - a candidate will win in a state if they secure all the support in the area that is currently relevant in there.

Despite the occasional swing of luck (the so-called media cards and some dice rolling) it comes down mostly to both players building a good deck (the initial pools are almost completely symmetric) and using it wisely. All cards are played out several times throughout the game so that players can try to think out ways to counteract the opponent, and selecting the sequence of states to aim at (only four at a time on the table) can also be a powerful tactical tool.

Unfortunately this otherwise outstanding game has got a nearly fatal bug - as soon as a player amasses all cards in their hand, the other one can only pray until they can do so as well (if at all). This reduces the game's replayability very drastically - some cards will always be selected for the deck and a even with two equally skilled players the game will be pretty much snatched by the first one to get a full hand.

Another wonderful game by two awesome game designers. I thoroughly enjoy 1960 every time I get the chance to play. I really enjoy this game for it's quick and simple play as well and because of this I am very excited to play this game on a more regular basis. The mechanics are so well integrated and unique, the game is really enjoyable. 

My favorite things are the electoral vote track marked by won state chips, the card decks which you build your campaign strategy of 15 cards (unique to every game) and the components. The components and artwork are outstanding. The mechanics are so unique and absolutely fun to play. Another fantastic game that proves to be educational as well. I will be sharing this one with my school's history teacher and students.

This is especially great fun playing the night after voting in a new presidential election. With the excitement of the constant news updates and getting out to vote really makes this game perfect when all of that is fresh in your life. It is also fun to relive the past through the events portrayed in the campaign decks and the ZNN deck, that happened back in 2008.

RATING: 7
The game starts with quick-ish deck drafting exercise - you'll end up with a third of the cards provided - and then it's a deck v deck competition to win states. Winning a state is getting your 5 cubes out on the side where the "key platform" indicator is - all done via cards. There'll be 4 states in play at any one time, of different values and with different head-starts to each player, making it easier / harder to win according to theme. There isn't that nerve wracking tension that you'll find in the designers' parent games. In fact a lot of the game is a pushme-pullyou tussle of cube on, cube off. The cards provide options to place cubes, adjust the platform indicator, draw extra cards, etc. You're trying to cycle through your deck repeatedly (it's play 1 OR draw 1), aiming to have your best cards in hand when the big valued states come out so you can outlast the pushme-pullyou contest. As a result, it's a bit samey once you get going. The contest is all about seeing who's built the better deck this time.The gameplay probably warrants a 7. A higher rating will depend on whether the promised variety in attempting different styles of decks holds up.

Awesome 2 player game !! Many strategies and tactics. Plus it teaches about campaigning in today's world. I can actually set aside my political feelings about that election, and play a fantastic game about an historical presidential milestone.

Interesting political deck-building game, with quite tense play, as you watch your opponents line of markers inch toward victory.  1960 has more flavor, but has no deck-building aspect.  Copy traded. Gift to Jim N.

RATING: 6
The mechanics are reasonably straightforward, although somehow a bit difficult to explain. The strategy is quite difficult to grasp, as you have to decide which states to compete in, and how. 

Playing with the preset decks for your first game is definitely a good idea. Our first game took 80 minutes, but I can see it being under an hour in the future.

The score track has gotten some criticism, but for us it worked very well. If it's within a vote or two, you recount, just like in real life. The other components are very nice.

One might look at this game as Balloon Cup on steroids. Both feature conflicts in 4 areas at a time. Where BC has the high/low polarities, CM has simultaneous battles in the defense/economy issues, as well as the key demographic polarity flipping.

I think the weight of 2.2 is about right. Probably 2.0 for rules, and 2.5 for depth of play.

Campaign Manager 2008 is a two-player card game in which players try to sequentially win states, with their corresponding number of electoral delegates, to earn their candidate the U.S. Presidency in 2008. While the game feels like a classic two-player "tug-of-war" style game, it isn't really, as delegates stay earned once they're earned--this helps give the game a definitive play length. The differently-sized states granting different amounts of delegates felt both strategic and thematic, the sequential ordering made it feel more like a primary than a general election. Since players will end up going through their deck multiple times, a lot of the strategy of the game revolves around knowing what your opponent can and can't do--which, of course, lends importance to the pre-game "deck-building" aspect. Overall, I found this to be a fun simulation.

When I heard about this game, the thing that I was most excited about was the deck-building mechanic. (At the start oft he game, each player flips through their 45 cards 3 at a time, keeping 1, ending up with a deck of 15 for that game) After playing several times, this remains my favorite aspect of the game. 

Note: The first time playing this doesn't give a good impression of the game - the 2 pre-sets were too symmetrical to make a very interesting contest. Don't be discouraged until you try with deck drafting.

This is a nice game, but it does require you to study the cards in order to be able to play it with any chances of success. The mechanics of the game are quite simple, but the actual text of each card needs to be known when you are selecting your starting hand, so your strategy is sound throughout the game. I will play this game with a person that likes it, but I will probably not get a copy of it.

First play of course with the starter 'deck' and though not as strong thematically as 1960, I would pick this for a political duel not only for the shorter playing time and ease of play, but mainly for the novel and exciting way the votes are tallied. However my first game was a close fought campaign and found the vote strips didn't make it easy to determine how close the difference was. I would have liked channels in the tally board when they went all out to make the states unnecessarily chunky.

I like how you can pace the play by choosing weak or stronger scoring states to match the strength of your hand, so interested in the drafting aspect.

My first play with the pre-constructed decks was less than satisfying, but intriguing. It felt too tit-for-tat in the way 1960 is, but with less options and room for creativity. With the deck-building, it is a decent game, but I fear card draw strategies dominate and replayability is thus limited.

I've been waiting for this game for a long time, having been obsessed with the Obama vs McCain election at the time and recently discovering the sublime Twilight Struggle (my new-to-me game of January). The production is gorgeous, but after the first play I had a bit of an 'is that it?' moment. The cards aren't anything like as thematic as those in Twilight Struggle as they mostly just do different combinations of 4 basic actions (draw, shift issue, add support, shift demographic). But after 4 games in one day (with my regular Struggle opponent) I was convinced by it. It's not supposed to be anything like TS - the design goals are completely different - and to suppose it would be was silly. I came to appreciate the little tactical moves you can pull off (often concerned with the ordering of states), and the different decks you can draft. I'm keen to play more soon, but I do have some concerns about replayability and the possibility of an optimal deck. I'd also have liked the decks to be more asymmetric; I've played as both sides and it doesn't really feel much different
 
UPDATE: the cons outweighed the pros in the end and I traded it away.

Tentative rating after 1 play.  May go up with "deck building" method.  But the game suffers from the deadly blow of requiring significant familiarity with the cards.  Intimate familiarity.  Like Magic the Gathering.  Sure, you can tailor a deck, but you can only do it reasonably well after learning all the cards and their interplay.  And that's a bad thing.

Good two player game with tremendous educational potential - and this coming from a Canadian who is not terribly interested in American politics. Players build decks that will influence votes/issues in the remaining undecided states. One card (available in both decks - the one that lets you draw three cards) is unbalanced which can easily be pulled. Played on yucata.de and have since purchased.

This game is super light and straight forward. Normally, I would pass on a game like this, but for some reason I enjoy it. I like the theme and the quick play. It's just some good light fun with a good theme, that's all I can say. This is a great one for a two player filler in between big games or a weekday night where you are tired and just want to play a quick 30 minute game. This will stay in my collection for that reason.

RATING: 7
Real tug-of-war game where the right cards at the right time mean a lot. I never got the impression there was a general "strategy" to the game, more like collecting as many cards in your hand as possible, and then striking at the right opportunity. 

While deck drafting and one-on-one card games are not quite my thing, the theme definitely is. Really enjoyed my three games so far.

Newbie tip: ignore the basic game and, even if you don't draft, randomly choose 15 cards. The basic game is symmetrical, dull and overlong. 

Unfortunately my wife doesn't like it, meaning it won't be getting a lot of play.

After reading some mixed reviews, I wasn't sure what to expect from this one. However, me and the wife picked it up pretty quickly, and enjoyed it very much. 

Twilight Struggle is one of our favourites, though it's not easy to find the time to get through it. This scratches a similar card-based, political itch, though it's obviously nowhere near as deep. 

The theme is good, the components are really nice (especially the scoring track) and the game has some interesting mechanics - such as the campaign deck 'building' at the start of the game, and the way new states are introduced. It has a familiar feel to it, and though it plays quite quickly, I feel there is plenty of scope for different strategies.

Deck building and card play in a fast, fun, and clever card game reminiscent of 1960:tMoaP. Too often feels like a back-and-forth tug-of-war determined by luck of the draw, since there are such limited moves to perform each turn (especially with only 4 states in play at any given time).

The fastest playing of the "Cards for Control" genre from Jason Matthews and one that I find very appealing.  The card drafting (ie using a different subset of the total deck) as well the varying when states come out and which "breaking news" elements emerge all add to an increased replayability of this game while also reducing the time of play all positives in my book.

I also like this game as it is easier to explain and introduce (rules are very simple) as the card play is aimed at one thing only instead of multiple tracks on the other games.  Also with only four states at a time to contest, much more of a seesaw battle between the players going back and forth.  With all that, I can see this as a great gate-way game to the CDG genre as well and looking forward to additional playes.

Well done Presidential election game which is both quick playing (by getting rid of the 30 or so solid states and playing only the 20 battlegrounds).  

The cards provide good flavor for the election.  And the dual track system used provides a good back and forth battle for each state.

A quick cardbuilding 2-player game featuring the election campaign 2008. The mechanics are good as there are decisions to make with the help of a little luck. However the choice of theme is alil bit rash, as the 2008 election ended up one of the biggest lopsided win in the history. Same mechanics could be applied on 2000, where Al got more votes but still lost the campaign due to short of electoral. Anyway it's also a good introduction of US election system to non-US player.

I liked the concepts: both the deck building and the mini history lesson.  I am not sure it quire worked but need to give it a few more plays.  In my first play we both went through are decks three times so the cards get repetitive during the game.  I played the intro games so I skiped the deck construction step.  

It would be great to see sets of cards for different elections but the price point would have to be pretty low.  May not be worth it for the designer/publisher.

RATING: 6
Part of the problem I'm finding after a few plays is that it's too easy with the card actions to keep basically all but one or two of your cards in your hand. This is powerful and seems to be the ONLY way for both players to play. Unfortunately it leads to the same types of cards being selected for each game. If you're unlucky in the card selection it's harder to do this, but not impossible. If both players build their decks in this way you can get a stalemate where the game never ends - you just go back and forth for about an hour until you decide if you wanted this sort of back and forth motion you'd have a lot more fun having sex. This can be problematic depending on your opponent's sex, sexual persuasion, marital status, etc.

Apart from this issue that arises more often the more experienced the players are, I've found the game solid, enjoyable, with a well matched theme. The wife gives it her stamp of approval. It's a simple and effective system - very logical and not needing much effort to think about the rules instead of the fun of the game. If the game doesn't drag it can indeed be fun...ish.

I was a little disappointed that the cards didn't show a little more imagination - they seem a bit samey. I can think of a half dozen inventive ideas (that'd be good fun) off the top of my head - even similar card actions we've seen in other games would be good - going through the discard deck. As it stands when I'm selecting my one card out of three I'm just not feeling that it's a hard enough choice - I'd like to have the feeling 15 times that I really want all three, but damn it, I can only keep one.

I guess I'd be really pleased to see an expansion version with dual action cards (like other card driven games), to bring the game to an advanced level. I appreciate the game as it is, but I'd definitely be interested in something like this... oh no... I'm feeling the need to create my own deck.

I feel this game missed the chance to be really good. The base system is good - some expansion and modified cards could fix the issues with the game and give it some more satisfying depth. I'd be interested in that.

An excellent short-lengthed treatment of the campaigns of McCain and Obama.  The flavour text and photos on the card really bring the theme to life.

RATING: 4
A lot better than I expected from reading the super-simple rules. Fits comfortably below 1960 in the Matthews-Leonhard 2-player political game 3-tier (Twilight Struggle - 1960 - Campaign Manager), but the depth feels just right for 30-45 minutes. Emphasis on hand management (as opposed to 1960, which was more do-the-best-with-what-you-have). Really like the scoring track and clean minimalist art design, and it adds a lot to the playing experience.

Some interesting strategic considerations like going for broke versus playing it close to the vest (just like real campaign strategy), and how it changes depending on who has media support (the candidate without media support prefers to draw battles out).

Unless you don't want to bother with 15-20 minutes extra on your first game, you should dive right into the deck-construction process.

------------

Light has gone out after 3 plays. Deck construction is merely praying that your good cards don't come out together and your bad cards don't come out together. Repeatedly cycling through 15 cards in the deck makes the game feel very repetitive. Especially if it's obvious early that your deck blows. There is little flavor in deck construction either, as you try to just nab the best cards in the right ratios. I'm not a fan of games where you decide your approach in the first couple of minutes, and then the rest is mostly just playing it out.

---------------

A little too harsh. This game conveys a nice CCG-like feel when you don't have to teach the other player. Still very constrained by what cards are clumped together when building your deck, however. And the two sides could have had more asymmetric cards. A lot of the cards are necessities when building your deck, and you're in trouble if your opponent has them and you don't.

2+2

Very easy to learn, fun game about the 2008 election.  I've heard that this is a gateway to games like 1960 and if so, I'm eager to play that one as well.  I'd recommend using pre-constructed decks until you know what the cards do.  I'm curious about replay value over time, but definitely a keeper.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Ok, so the verdict is out... it's a 5. I don't believe the game is broken, nor the draft part of the game. As much as I would like to take all the 'right' cards to play, the drafting proces just will not allow it. Therefore you will always have to adjust to some sort of sub-optimal hand to play your game with, and that makes for an ok game. Having said that; it's kind of boring to know in advance what cards you simply 'must' pick in order to have a decent chance at winning. And if you happen to be Mc Cain it won't help to know that YOU WILL lose that Fundraiser at some point in the game...

Edit: just finished another game that took waaaay to long. I couldn't build up a decent deck because all 'draw'cards seem to fall together with all the other good cards and my opponent just had to many go negatives and demographics. So we ended up drawing out a game that took us more than an hour before my opponent simply gave up. It's just not interesting.

What can be bad, sometimes is also good. With the drafting 1 out of 3 you are sometimes forced to make a choice out of 2 lesser Evils. It helps to keep the game fresh, but I must stress that this game needs to be under 60 minutes before it could start to shine. Right now we were at 70 minutes. Still too long

Again the forece of the draw helps keep things interesting but at 70 min a play and all to hope for is ineffiency of drawing cards, does not help in making a game worth your efforts. Still, you can be challenged when the game doesn't give you the right deck indeed.

RATING: 5
A game which captures all the excitement of the 2008 US presidential campaign, which – to be honest – isn’t saying much. The biggest positive about CM2008 is that it is thematic and a good introduction to political concepts such as swing states and negative campaigning.

From a gameplay standpoint, I like the idea of competing on two victory tracks but the rest of the game is a toss-up. Both candidates’ decks are nearly identical, with most of the asymmetry enforced through a crude drafting system instead. And because the card effects are incremental at best, the result is a rather repetitive and tactical tug-of-war. There’s also a well-founded concern regarding a vexing deck recursion strategy, although that can be mitigated through a simple house rule on hand size limits. 

In the end, CM2008 is just a decent duel. I would like it more if it either played under 30 minutes or contained more asymmetry. Also worth noting is that while the graphics are on point, the score track is easily upset whenever a new bar is added to the graph.

[6 plays] If I gave half point ratings, this would be a 6.5 instead of a 7. Reasons why it doesn't quite fulfill include:
1) Theme is thinner than you might think at first
2) 15 card decks are pretty repetitive when there's little or no mechanism to change or improve them throughout the game
3) Poorly drafting your deck is an absolute game-killer, and until you have many games under your belt, you may not do it well at all. Once that happens, the game can turn into a long, slow, brutal one-sided slaughter.

Reasons why this game almost deserves the 7 is:
1) Speed of play
2) There are interesting decisions to make, and real tension in when to start drawing back and cede initiative to your opponent
3) The basic mechanics are solid.

Most recent plays Nov '17.

Attractive, if overproduced, two-player card game on the historic 2008 US elections.

Players use a deck of 15 cards to place influence across various states. You 'win' the state if you have majority influence in one of two issues that concern the state. Rinse and repeat until someone wins enough states. Cards also also extra card draw, shifting issues etc.

The small deck makes the game quite procedural (in a dull way). You can also elect to draft the 15 card deck from the 45 cards each. This adds a more interesting element to gameplay but as seen on the boards, it suffers from some MtG issues. Cards = flexibility to execute actions = recursive draw decks = FtW.

There are other two-player board games I like better. Jambo comes to mind.

My wife loves it. The deck drafting at the beginning keeps some variety, but there are copies of several cards and you can usually end up with the cards you want.

It does make you look at elections a little differently, after all the times we've ignored smaller states while battling over Florida, Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania and after pandering to specific demographics. Obviously, it's over-simplified but it's a lot of fun if you spent the 2008 election addicted to Fivethirtyeight. Maybe not as fun if you're a hardcore strategy gamer.

RATING: 7
Card-driven, Area Control. Another great game from the Matthews/Leonhard team. This distills the area control and gameplay of 1960 down to a fairly small package. There are two vote tracks on each state, and the state is won when one player has all the votes on one track -- whichever track matches the currently dominant issue (economy or defense). So, you're working two angles, trying to get all the votes AND keep the issue on the side where you're getting those votes, and of course frustrating your opponent's intention to do the same.

There isn't as much variety in the cards as in 1960 or Twilight Struggle, as many of the cards do the same basic thing (there are no Ops, everything here is card text), but the result is a very streamlined game. My friend and I completed our first play in less than an hour, and I can see a full game approaching the listed play time with another play.

We played the "basic" game and I look forward to the full game, which essentially adds a drafting mechanic to build your 15-card play deck for the game.

Traded. I got it played a couple more times, but it didn't maintain much interest with anyone, plus too much competition in the 2p space for me to keep it.

Dropped from a 9 for Yucata version.

You do need to implement a house rule regarding hand sizes.  on Yucata it's possible to have a hand of 12 cards ... that breaks what the game is supposed to be about.  A house rule that no more than 7 cards can ever be in your hand is a must for this game to be what it's supposed to be.

An interesting 2-player game in two parts. In Part 1, you build your campaign strategy deck, then in Part 2, you duke it out with your opponent in up to 20 battleground states. I like that the game is overall politically neutral, even as it brings across the very different personalities of the two candidates and their 2008 presidential campaigns.

Prototype play at Origins.

A really fun 2-player game of deck-building, but without all that crazy shuffling!

Each player first customized their deck of cards, coming down to a _very_ low number. Then you play those cards trying to gain majorities in various states (the order of which is determined by the players) to earn the electoral votes to win the election.

After you're familiar with the cards, the game should move along very quickly. I suspect I'll enjoy this more than Dominion (base game, at least) because the deck-building happens all at once, and more quickly, here; there's not a lot of shuffling!; and the theme and game play fit together better.

Looking forward to getting the final version!

After only one play, I can tell this is a game I have to buy.  It distills the 1950 game down to its essence, shortening the game time without sacrificing any of the decision making. In fact, the deck building at the start offers very interesting choices and I can see experienced players really getting deep into this game.  At the same time, I'm not sure if I would prefer using all 60 cards instead.  Either way, it is too much fun.  The system seems to be open to adding candidates from other historical elections.  That would be a dream come true!

Played as a prototype. I liked the base game and found the mechanics simple yet not simplistic. There's still a lot of work to do trying to make the game a bit more interesting than it is now. Either way it's a solid design and I guess it would be very successful. I will rate the final version only because I want to see the final production.
__________________________________________________________________

Played the final production. It's the same game basically that I I played before its official release and that's a good thing. The choice of cards seems to be the best strategy to have because the play of the cards it's just tactic use. The game works pretty well mainly because it's very tight in all its aspects. Playing with Obama or Mcain is different in some details but not that different. I think this is one of the best two player games I know and certainly the best two player game of this weight and time of play. Very challenging. I like the production enough to want to own a copy but I'm not very fancy of the box art nor the scoring system with those small tokens in the grid.

I like to play this game but I think it has some problems. First of all I don't think its replay ability is very strong. Secondly some of the events are chaotic an can destroy someone's strategy just because they occur at the wrong moment and that's impossible to prevent.

I rate it an 8 in a special two player category because otherwise a seven would be fairer.

This is a fun, and rich, 2 player game with a strong breadth of decisions, but slightly limited depth.  It is also very thematic, but not really to the 2008 election--which is not necessarily a bad thing.  The theme is strong in that you really do feel like a campaign manager picking and choosing where and how to fight over th battle ground states, but the basic card interactions/mechanics are rather generic-the differences between playing Obama or McCain or Bush or Gore or whatever aren't really thematically beyond the photos and the flavor text.  The game could easily cover any of th elections over the past 20 years.

The game is longish for a 2 player euro-style game, but that is rather refreshing since most 2 player euros are short and quite light.  This isn't heavy but there is lots to think about at each decision point because while you have limited tactical options with a small hand of cards, you have a strategically broad area of application since you have to not only watch the electorate up for grabs, but also be well aware of the cards left in your draw stack as well as your opponent's.  And the game lasts long enough and the draw deck of 15 cards is small enough that you should know what maneuvers your opponent is capable of in the first quarter of the game.

It reminds me a little of Aton, one of my favorite 2 player games, in that there are 4 states in contention at any one time, and you need to swing the control in any one without giving up too much in the others.

After more plays I'm revising this up to an 8.  It's really white enjoyable and holds up well.

I think the drafting mechanic needs a sideboard--cards that you could swap into your deck in response to cards you know yournopponent has, say prior to th first reshuffle.  Not sure how to get those cards though--choice, additional drafting, etc?

Purchased from www.bouldergames.com on 1/28/10

First play with basic setup was great at first, but then got a bit boring.  Hoping the second game goes better.

The second play did not get any better.  This game is a boring exercise in repetition which requires almost no critical thinking or decision making.  I'd play it if requested, but I really wouldn't want to.

I traded this off in March 2010.

And then I re-acquired it on 2/17/2011 from GameSurplus.com.  

I've been playing on Yucata.de and I can't remember why I disliked it so much early on.  It's awesome.  Now, to get more F2F games in with my wife!

I like this one a lot, but the wife doesn't.  Traded away in March 2011.

It's pretty fast and I quite like the card mechanic (dare I say it, more than in Twilight Struggle). I can see this wouldn't have a huge amount of replayability but, based on one play, I quite like this. Perhaps it's currently my favourite of the 3 card based political games.

I do tend to swim against the flow...

Also, the component quality is so much better than the GMT produced TS. That shouldn't matter, but it does. At least a little.

Everything here works well ... it's just not that exciting. The game has an odd flow. You start with 15 cards and an overwhelming number of choices. By the end, however, players are usually down to just a few cards and choices become pretty obvious. Political junkies will probably love this. I think I'd rather play 1960: The Making of the President if I want a two-player campaign game, although Campaign Manager 2008 is definitely shorter and thus has its own niche.

Pounced on this as a Tanga deal.  It's all right, and I will probably play it several more times, but it seems like a lot of the cards are just plain not that useful.  Love the concept and the presentation, but the game seems a bit rough.  Maybe a few more plays will change my mind.

RATING: 4
Really better than I anticipated considering I bought this game new for only $4. I put off playing this for a very long time because I anticipated it being really complex based on its designer. But boy was I wrong. The game is incredibly simple. On a turn you just draw a card or play a card, and the card effects are pretty simple. It seems like it might get repetitive as you cycle through the just 15 cards each game. The card draft should ensure you have a unique group of cards each game though.

I really think the production hurt this game. The little black wooden pieces are unattractive, and the scoring method, while neat, is fiddly and easy to misread. If they made this game look more vibrant like 1960: The Making of the President then I think it could have been a bigger hit.

Rating could go up or down after more plays.

Works well, nice quick play.  It is a shame that the decks aren't more asymmetrical but for something so quick and balanced that may be too much to ask.  I don't understand why so many comments say this is either "the same as" or a "simplified" 1960; the two games are totally different.

Simple is sometimes good and as for a coffeeshop game with my coworker this is perfect. Right amount of time and competitiveness to keep us playing.

I see what the designer was trying to do. The game has moments that are really good and the prebuilt decks are interesting, but the drafting game is broken.

This was the very last game that I tried at BGG.CON '09 before hopping on the airport shuttle to head home. The library had been packed up and the halls were remarkably empty, but thankfully Matthew Monin had purchased a copy of Campaign Manager at the Z-Man booth and offered to teach the game to me. It was a great way to wrap up the convention. I've been thinking back on the game ever since, thinking about things I could have done differently and things I'd like to try in my next game, which is a very good sign. I've been eagerly awaiting the arrival of my pre-order copy, which is another good sign. Having only played the game once, I don't know the system or the cards well enough to be certain how I'll feel after 10 more plays, but I get the sense this will be an excellent addition to my list of Super Fillers for 2, potentially even joining the elite ranks of Hansa and Through the Desert. I say I don't know for certain how I'll feel because you really don't see much of the game in a single play. At the beginning of the game players select 15 cards out of 45 possibilities to make up their deck for the game, and then you play the game itself by cycling through those 15 cards repeatedly (although perhaps the "game itself" is more the selection process upfront than the resolution process). So you don't see the majority of the cards in one game or the majority of the possible strategies because ideally you've selected cards that work together to form a cohesive strategy. There are a lot of other possible approaches that I'd like to try out, and hopefully further play will show me tension between the various approaches that makes the decision-making enjoyably agonizing and challenging.

Campaign Manager 2008 challenges players to develop a winning political strategy within the tumultuous context of the 2008 presidential campaign. Employing a new take on card driven game systems, each player will create a unique deck that represents their advice to their candidate. The players will struggle to influence voters in the critical swing states from this election, while targeting key constituencies that just might put them over the top. Players will try to define the key issue in the states. Will McCain dominate the national security debate, or can Obama play on people's fears over the economy? As the campaign manager of a national presidential campaign, you will either identify the road to the White House, or the road to irrelevance.

Compered to the 1960 Making of the Presinden, I enjoyed more the fact that the game wasn't just 'zero sum play' - but in here you can do wrong moves and really lose the influence for good.

After first play, the key demographic felt way too weak and uninteresting. I'm all a bit worried about the replaybility of the game as the seemed to be quite symmetric and cards did only few (interesting) things.

A minor complaint is also that, after you have won your state, you must choose which state to play next. I would have preferred just a random draw or something more elegant. The current system just slows the game down and I just didn't felt any joy going through the state deck and decide which one to pick.

I'll revise the rating when I break out of the precon decks, but right now, it doesn't have the nailbiting tension that I felt from 1960 (especially because you go through the deck several times). Still, I anticipate it'll be raised once I get more plays in :)

Edit: I haven't really found the urge to break this out ever again, mostly because its theme isn't quite as strong/well done, and to be honest, there's no way it holds a candle to Battle Line.

I was disappointed in how "symmetric" the game is. Aside from the photos on the cards, there's really no difference between the McCain deck and the Obama deck. So, it's more about deck building and card-playing than managing your candidate's strengths and weaknesses. I traded it away.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is the game that [gameid=27708] should have been.  It's fast, relatively symmetrical, and feels much, much more connected to the situation than its longer older brother.  The back and forth of the campaign is effectively simulated, without being overly frustrated.

My biggest complaint is that there could stand to be a bit more to differentiate the candidates and the cards.  Although the drafting allows some variation between games, most of the cards are very similar.  A real election wonk will see some particulars to crow about, but for most game players, defense and economy will become indistinguishable, as will any of the key demographics.  Perhaps that's the job of a campaign manager, but that's just depressing.

Didn't play this until 2012 and the new election process is starting up again.  A card game where you battle over the "battleground" states on a race for the needed electorate votes.  I have only played the Obama side, due to my opponents wanting to play McCain, but the cards seem somewhat similar on each side - kind of mirror image-ish, just different titles, for the most part.

Take each individual country battle from Twilight Struggle, explode it out into single individual battles, and add in a card mechanism that simplifies the process (e.g., they no longer have dual purposes), and you get Campaign Manager 2008.  The complexity level has been drastically reduced, but the drafting mechanism gives the game some replayability, while the card draw and the different possibilities for developing a deck create a nice tension in a game that takes 1/10th of the time to play.  I think Jason's fans will find a new gem in this game.

I love 1960, but this just doesn't have the same impact on me. Doesn't feel as thematic, and I don't like seeing the same 15 cards for the whole game. I'm probably just not a fan of deck building, which doesn't help.

Big draw strategy breaks the game: Both players can get their entire deck in hand, at which point they can immediately undo anything the other player does. If you attempt to break out of this deadlock you will lose.

10 card hand limit won't work as a fix, then it just becomes randomly about who are lucky enough to not eventually get stuck with all their countercards in the discard. And this will decide one state.

I wanted to like this game. I love the theme. I gave it many tries on Yucata, trying to prove it better than it is. But it's simply a very bad game. Even without the big draw strategy, it's just not very interesting.

RATING: 5
Just as 1960:The Making of a President is a simplified version of Twilight Struggle, Campaign Manager 2008 is itself a simplified version of 1960. It more or less does away with the board and focuses strictly on card play. To start the game both players draft a 15 card deck from a pool of 45 cards. This deck is then used over and over again to battle over three states at a time, until someone wins the election.

The game plays well and is fairly intuitive, but the small deck size and lack of variety in the cards absolutely kills it in regards to re-playability. In 1960, the Nixon and Kennedy decks have radically different (and historically accurate) effects on the game. In CM 2008, the two decks are almost mirror images of each other. This fact, along with the incredibly small 15 card draft decks make the game a bit boring and repetitive, especially over multiple plays. The best I can say about it, is that it does work well as an introduction to some of the mechanics used in both Twilight Struggle and 1960, so by extension it should make those titles easier to learn and digest.

I can see this sometimes degenerating into a terrible repetitive "tit for tat" contest that takes forever.  More asymmetry in the decks was a no-brainer, and yet...very leery of these guys now (1960 was SO MUCH worse than TS, and now this).  I bought into the idea instead of waiting, and now have buyer's remorse.

Very interesting game that is pretty faithful to its theme.  It is pretty simple to teach.  I like the opportunity it provides to build your deck as you see fit prior to starting.

An amazing discovery, I really enjoy the deck building games and this one have a lot of strategies to play and try to win your opponent. The bad side of the game is that you have to study every card, how to play them and know how works the different states, so it's not easy in the first plays.

Un descubrimiento impresionante, disfruto mucho con los juegos de contrucción de mazos de cartas y este tiene un montón de estrategias para jugar y tratar de ganar a tu oponente.

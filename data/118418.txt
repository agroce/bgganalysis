This game had more strategy to it than it seemed to have at first glance.  Kinda like Colossal Arena, but a more subdued theme.  Have only played it with two players, and I'd be fascinated to see how it plays out with four.

Cool bluffing and deduction game that plays in 20 minutes.  The scoring in this game is really cumbersome and really needed some streamlining before hitting the printing press.

A very good card-drafting filler-game, with great production values. Players predict how many cards of each colour will be played in a round, and alter their predictions as the round progresses, scoring points for accuracy.

[b]Liar's Dice[/b], if you had to reveal 1 die at a time...sort of.  I'm not the biggest fan of deductions.  It was okay, it just wasn't exciting and it seemed to go on too long.

As others have commented, the game this is reminiscent of is Knizia's Flinke Pinke/Quandary/Loco.  There is the same gradual revelation of the worth of things, the same betting on the basis of limited information, the same sense of impending doom as options diminish.  Divinare adds some potential for bluff and a touch of screwage.  I predict that this will be a hit.

Divinare is nicely themed around a contest of psychics.  The artwork is rather gorgeous and production quality is excellent.  The rules are straightforward and clear.

I have to admit, I'm a total skeptic and hate anything that is remotely related to divination/mediums/channeling/psychics, so when I played Divinare, I was pleasantly surprised by the game play.

Part deduction, bluffing, and hand management makes it a nice light filler.

This was a dog, dog, dog for me.  I was already skeptical when it revealed itself as a partial-info memory game while being taught, but the control, holy cow.  This can be mitigated with hand management, but there are still situations where you are either forced to make ridiculous "move yellow, move yellow back to where I was, move yellow, move yellow back to where I was" type "decision" loops because you can only activate based on what you were dealt, didn't pass, and were passed.  I truly hated this game, and have no interest in giving it a second chance.

A great little game, and another excellent production from Asmodee.  The art and cards are of excellent quality, and even the box is beautiful.  I'm not sure why some people don't seem to enjoy the theme, I thought it was perfect and only added to the game.

This is best with 3 or 4 players, but with the suggested 2-player variant from the designer it works very well with only two.  This really should have been the default rule for 2 player games.

Preliminary Rating: 9 (may slip to 8).  This game is so much more than I expected.  Reading it, it felt simplistic, but playing it felt like Poker (particularly when playing 2-player).  There's some deduction, some bluffing, some luck, plus there's a chance to have some control over what the other player's are able to do.  This may be my surprise hit of 2012/2013.

RATING: 5
I found this game deeply frustrating: you guess how many of each suit will be in play and score based on how well you've guessed. So far, so Perudo. But each card you play essentially forces you to change your guess; and, because you cannot guess the same as someone else, you'll find your accurate guess early on is taken, while you're forced to play somewhere else. Moreover, you're being passed cards each round, which means the decisions quickly leave your control. I definitely didn't get the strategy at all for this game, but don't really have the inclination to learn it either.

There are all together too many levers in this game. Card passing token moving, all these consequences and things to remember. And for what? It seems that many rounds are determined by that last card you get passed. And you have zero control over that. It ended up feeling like, for me, a game who's complexity far outweighed it's depth. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is an okay filler where you're trying to guess how many cards there are in total of each type. You have some clues and some knowledge, but the mechanics that you always have to move when you play a card can really screw you over big time in the last round! So, even though you've actually made the best qualified guesses, you might end up getting nothing.

My personal recommended number of players: 3, 4

Charming and clever, this is the deduction game that I have been waiting for.  It's a interactive and competitive, a rare feat for deduction games.

RATING: 9
Still working out the best way to signal opponents and manage my hand to swoop into the correct spot.  Nice game of emergent information and deduction.  There is a strong incentive to mislead your opponent without leaving yourself in a bad position during the bidding.  Sometimes you have to make the call to move your marker back in the center and lose out on some points rather than taking negatives.

I just played my first 4 player game and am amazed how differently the game played.  In the two player game, I feel like the meat of the game is hiding information from your opponent to allow yourself that perfect bid.  In the four player game, it seemed more of a game of timing, making the phase where you pass cards to your neighbors much more important to get rid of cards rather than to hide information.

Es seleccionen a l'atzar un determinat numero de cartes (d'acord amb el número de jugadors), i es reparteixen entre ells, amb lo que cada jugador sap una part de les cartes que hi ha en joc. En determinats moments de la partida, es passen cartes al jugador del costat i se'n reben de noves, de manera que obtenim nova informació sobre el número total de cartes de cada color.
Es van jugant les mateixes cartes i s'ha d'endevinar (i es puntua) quantes n'hi ha de cada color.

Players are 19th century mediums, competing in a tournament to find the best seer amongst them.  Lovely little card game.  36 cards are shuffled, 12 set aside, and the remaining 24 dealt out to the players.  There are four uneven suits (6, 8, 10 and 12).  Players pass three cards to their right hand neighbour, then begin playing to the left.  Turns are simple - play a card from your hand, then place your betting piece on the matching suit's betting board - guestimating how many cards in that suit are in the player's combined hand (i.e. the original 24 cards).  As the turns progress, more and more information is revealed.  Cards are again passed when there are four, and two, cards remaining in hand.  At the end of the hand, points are awarded for dead on, or close, guesses for each of the four suits, as well as bonus points for correct extreme probability guesses.  There are some neat touches here... the rule that forces players to relocate their bet is genius - you may be forced out of a bet that you think is ideally positioned.  Passing cards to your neighbours is also delightfully nasty, as they will have to play those cards and relocate.  Simple, Knizia-esque, clever.  Knizia's Members Only is a nostalgic favorite, but this feels better.  Gorgeous production, plays in 30 minutes.  A winner.

[b][FirstImpression/PlayOn25thMarch2014][/b] Was taught by a friend and it was a four player game. Best played with four, and make sure you only play with that player count.

I was surprised at how much I like the game! It has some memory element which I'm not fond of but certainly wasn't a deal breaker for me in this game. Players who dislike memory element, please don't let it stop you from trying this game.

Player are trying to figure out how many cards of each colour are in the round (from 36 cards, 12 are removed in the beginning of each round). On your turn, you must play a card, and then must make a prediction based on the colour that you just played. Before the round begins, each player passes three cards counter-clockwise. This will happen again when you're down with four cards - pass two cards, and then again when all players have two cards left - pass one card. This will allow you to get a hold of of how many cards of each type are there in the round, although not necessarily a main vantage point.

As players make prediction and more cards are revealed face-up, you'll get a certain idea of how many cards of each type are there in the game. There's also a bit of bluffing where you choose to reveal a certain colour late in the game, or sway others to follow you on how many colours are there. 

Good thing is points are rewards based on the exact match (3 points), as well as two predictions adjacent to the correct prediction (1 point).

Nice tension at the end of rounds as you scramble to move pieces into scoring positions.  Instead of primarily a memory issue, the hand management involves saving or passing cards in order to move your scoring tokens into favorable spots including withdrawing from the board to avoid negative points.  Great components as well.

Cleverly designed little deduction & memory game with room for some bluffing. It's nice that you get more information throughout the game by receiving cards from your neighbour, but also have the opportunity to play tactically by passing the right cards yourself. I suppose best way to play is not betting too risky, and make sure you claim the right spot on the right moment.

Normally I'm not so fond of deduction, nor memory & bluffing, but the combination really shines in this one. An interesting filler.

Divinare was a pretty clever light deduction game. Players are dealt hands of cards in four uneven suits. Each turn you play a card of a particular suit which allows you to place a wager for how many of those cards will eventually turn up. 

The trick is that at three points during the round you must pass half of your cards to the player on the right. This not only gives you information from your neighbor's hand, but allows you to shape exactly which information you reveal. Not all the cards are dealt out in a round, so you never know exactly how many of each suit are in play. However, every card that is dealt [i]must[/i] be played, so you can get a good idea of what to expect.

I've never experienced a "light" deduction game before, but this one does it well. It moves quickly, the choices are interesting, and the total game doesn't last too long.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Divinare is a light deduction betting game. There are four suits and after removing cards from the game, players must play a card, then with every play, bet how many cards are in that suit. Simple to play, the deduction is approachable and is a recommended gateway game of its type. Being forced to bet with every time you play a card is a very interesting mechanism that forces players to decide which card to play. With some small drafting added in, Divinare is a good warm up. Playing the recommended four rounds, however, seems to drag.

Played at Salt Con.  I had a really good time playing it but I have a hard time even calling it a game ultimately as there is really nothing besides guessing.  The fact that the final number of each type is determined at the outset of the round and cannot be affected by the players makes this more of a fun activity than an actual game to me.  More plays will probably happen eventually and this score will likely change a bit.

Feels to me like a descendent of Quandary/Loco/Flinke Plinke/Botswana, as well as Members Only -- which is a good thing. The 2-player games feels much different than with 3 or 4, but I like it with all three numbers. 

I really love the production and theme in this game. Not only are the boards and cards gorgeous, but each player gets a "character," and there are even short back-stories for each of the characters in the rulebook. A totally unnecessary but wonderful touch.

Quite fun divining (or deduction game) depending upon your psychic abilities. Pass 1/2 of your cards which are denominated in four suits to an opponent then guess how many will be played in each suit prior to the end of the round. 1/3 of the cards are randomly removed unseen from the deck so its part guess, part hunch ... and then there is a means of forcing opponnents off of the best no. prediction spots to score the maximum number of points. Best and recommended with 3-4.

Fun game. Even though it sounds like there's memorization involved, other aspects of the game are more important such that you can do well without memorizing much. There is quite a bit of luck, but there is no single "luck" moment that feels like you are getting boned.

RATING: 8
Super card-predicting game improves with every play.

The best thing - its a small card hame with an excellently integrated theme - I feel like a poor fortune teller as I try to correctly divine how many cards of each colour are left!

there is room for clever play, and passing the cards really adds to the strategy - you can pass a colour in order to try and knock a player off their prediction, thus freeing it up for you to steal it!

Simple and elegant - puts most 2012 Euro's into proper context.

A fascinating mish mash of drafting, deduction and risk taking with intriguing timing decisions. It is very interesting how the drafting part feeds the deduction and it is more important than usually in drafting games to try to understand which cards other players are holding and to direct others' pool of options to your own benefit. On a con side there's a slight starting player disadvantage.

RATING: 8.5
The perfect bookend filler game--not something you'll build a night around, but a few games is excellent as a board game appetizer or dessert. The rules are so easy, they can be taught in well under 5 minutes, and so simple, it astounds me (and those I teach it to) that there is any game present at all.

It seems devoid of decisions or strategy, and at first blush, sounds too straight forward...but always, by about turn 2 or 3, decisions become agonizing, and everyone has a moment where everything just crystallizes into--"Aha." Everything falls into place, and suddenly the interaction and engagement skyrockets. Deliciously clever, and there is plenty of room for bluffing, and trying to set yourself ahead, or an opponent behind (usually the person that precedes you). Wonderfully involving for both heavy and light gamers, I always sit back afterward and think, "Huh. It's always so much more interesting than it seems!"

I'd love to give it a 9, but even as a filler that never outstays its welcome, it's not something you "always" want to play.

やりたい事は解るのだが、いまいちシステムと合っていない気がした。

「ここだとわかっているのに、手札事情などで居られない」とかすっきりしない。
これに対して「配牌や手番順も含めてそういうゲームだ」と言ってしまうのは擁護しすぎだと思う。
あくまで「何枚あるかを当てる」ゲームなのだから、きちんと回答する為に四苦八苦するのは見当違い過ぎる。
「ザ・ボス」「メンバーズオンリー」の方がずっと良いゲーム。

RATING: 5.5
A game about betting how many cards of each of the four colours there are in the game. Each turn you have to play one of the cards from your hand, revealing a little more info, and then you have to make or change your bet on that colour. This is the tricky part: even if you know or think you know how many cards there are of that colour, you shouldn't bet on it yet as you'll have to change your bet each time you play that colour again. But since only 1 player can bet on each value, you may be unable to place the correct bet later on. I guess that's a nifty mechanism, but I just found it annoying, because more often than not I knew the amount of cards but had to bet on something I know was wrong. I suppose the goal is to mislead your opponents, but I don't see much opportunity for that.

I like Liar's Dice but I've never seen its central premise adapted well to other areas. This may have changed that. The premise is similar; as with Liar's Dice you're trying to predict the total number of things based on others' predictions and your limited but growing information. In this game, that manifests by passing cards, which makes assessing the numbers pretty tricky; you get more info, but at the cost of fuzzing up the numbers you've established. There's some added weirdness that's kind of off-putting in that you have to move your marker every turn, so if you're already correct you can't play a card without making yourself less correct, and you don't have a choice about playing cards. This kind of breaks the theme for me, but it's a quick filler and it adds to the tension, so no great harm done. All in all a nice reworking of a good idea.

First impression after one 4p and one 3p game.  This game put a smile on my face while playing it.  The rules are extremely simple to learn and teach, it's the strategies and layers of deception, deduction, and sabotage that make this game great.  A card game at heart that feels like playing a good card game.  With the right group of players (who can laugh at a move gone spectacularly wrong) it provides many opportunities for fun, excitement, surprise, and laughter.  Quick, hardly any downtime, portable.

Very good combination of bluffing, deduction and planning. Easy to teach. strategies are not obvious in first games, but then little by little you try to apply your own strategy, which can be completely different from others. The chance of winning for new players is also not bad, so it encourages playing it again. scalability is low, works only with 3 or 4 players.

RATING: 7
Light and fast deduction game, where the players have to figure out, how many cards of the four suits are in play, and manipulate the individual scoring boards of the suits. During the game, partly by playing cards, partly by splitting and passing around the remaining hands one can get a pretty good picture of the actual card distribution; the twist is, that with every card played you have to move your prediction token, so deciding what cards to pass on, what to hold, and when to play your final card of a suit makes the game exciting. Very simple rules, easy to teach, visually pleasing - ideal filler or opener.

This is a difficult game to rate. Knizia's "Members Only" is one of my all-time favorites and Divinare is very similar on the surface. Use only part of the deck and guess how many each suit are in player's hands all together.

The big difference is that Divinare doesn't reward correct guessing as you can always be forced to move your bet by being passed the card. It can be tactical fun but I do prefer solidness in Members Only.

The former "Oracle Pathway", which I played and loved during the jury meeting in the 2011 "Ciutat de Granollers" Boardgame Design Contest. A Knizia-esque game with the right amount of bluffing and hidden information which is progressively revealed. A small gem playable in 20 minutes.

A wild guessing game where you have hardly any control over what's happening. Gameplay is just too much work for what you have no control over anyway.

Un po' di casualità ma anche un poì di intuito sono gli ingredienti che troverete all'interno sella piccola scatola.

I agree with the comments that this game feels similar to [thing=398][/thing].

This game is way overproduced for what it is! I wouldn't have gotten this game if it wasn't on sale. I gout my copy for about $8; I think retail is $25. 

Clever game with somewhat counter-intuitive strategies, which is good. For example, cards are passed several times during a round. This not only gives you more information but enables you to manage the cards of your hand. Voiding a suit, for example, enables you to *not* play a card from that suit, which enables you to *not* move your token of that suit, which is sometimes disastrous near the end of the game!

Still, the ambiance of this game is of quiet contemplation. For a game this light, I would prefer something more raucous.

Damn the boring looking box cover or I would have looked at this sooner. But Martin insisted it's good and opportunity showed itself where I could try it and fell in love with it. It's a great game of double think - some interesting manoeuvring and bluffing and kinda deduction, but more of reading people and odds. And it get really fast into the "I think that you think that I suspect" kinda area.

I love with 3, but fell completely lost in 4 players as the logic is totally different (less actions to do stuff in). Theme fits the feel of the game well.

RATING: 8
Divinare is similar to Knizia's Loco (or [thing=398][/thing], or whatever it's called now), both being games of speculation in which each player has imperfect information on the number of cards present. The major difference is that in Divinare, players are directly making guesses on the amount of cards in a given set.

Divinare is a game of memory, bluffing and speculation in roughly equal parts. You can gradually deduce how many cards there are in a given set through card swaps and observing opponents' guesses, but you also have to be wary of attempts to mislead you. Just as tricky is the rule that you have to switch guesses every time you play a card; there is some loss of control here, but carefully chosen card swaps can trip an opponent up into moving an accurate guess somewhere else. 

The last thing worth noting is that the production values are fantastic for an abstract card game. I'm not too fond of the teeny-tiny VP tokens, but otherwise the artwork and components perfectly capture the atmosphere of competing psychics.

Derült égből villámcsapásként ért ez a játék, mert semmit nem hallottam róla, mikor elém került és kellemes meglepetést okozott. A játékosok kapnak adott számú 4 színű kártyákból, amikből valamennyit kiveszünk. Célunk megtippelni a játék során, hogy az egyes színekből mennyi van az éppen forgó pakliban. Körünk során egy kártyát lerakunk és annál a színnél tippelünk egyet. A játék felénél továbbadunk adott számú kártyát így további ismereteket szerezve az egyes színek számáról. Igazi taktikai, memória játék. Elsőre teljesen jó volt, talán sokadikra már unalmas lenne. Előnye, hogy nagyon sok másik kártyajáték lapjaival játszható. Nem egy korszakalkotó játék, de néha abszolút elővehető.

Divinare is another seemingly simple game that isn't so simple. Once you catch on, it's a tense game of timing, push your luck, and deduction. Tight, clever, stripped down, and thematic, I reccomend it.

I like the comment that described Divinare as "advanced Liar's Dice". It's a similar mix of iterative educated guessing -- and much of the strategy is in forcing other players to take positions they don't want. It's enjoyable, and the decisions feel agonizing, even if I do think that, like Liar's Dice, they are generally hollow. Gorgeous components.

A game of trying to guesstimate how many cards there are in each of four suits and trying to get a chance to bet on the number.  Unfortunately your chance to guess usually occurs before your chance to get information.  Interesting game.  Not an exact science.  P.S.  Reading the other comments here, I would like to add that I cannot abide Liar's Dice, but I enjoyed Divinare and would play it again.

A great little betting & out-guessing game. Lots of drafting, playing, betting & timing issues to take on board. I guess there's a slight feeling of Knizia's Loco!, but there's a lot more going on here even though the rules aren't much more complex.

After a few 3-player games and a single 4-player game, I'm struck by how different it plays with different number of players. Something to do with the "late game" card passing of the 4-player version?

Gorgeous production, too.

Like Fiji and the coin game Cheat gone to the afterlife.
A game where you havew to predict the final number of cards in each zone by using the limited information you have and acquire through a round.
Quite thoughtful and mildly intense.
Not a heavy but not light.
Good game

RATING: 6
Prediction card game with a lot of emphasis on memory. Players take the roles of mediums and are dealt a hand of cards each depicting one of four different symbols. Cards are then played in turn and each player has to predict how many of each card will have been played at the end of the round. To make this easier, cards are passed to opponents after a certain number (determined by number of players) have already been played. Points are awarded for predicting correctly and nearly correctly. Points are deducted for getting the prediction wrong by more than one. This is a challenging game as it's essential to try and remember which type of card you've passed to your opponents as you progress through the game if you hope to predict as accurately as possible. It can be a frustrating game though as it's difficult to develop the skills to play it well unless you possess them already.

This game is indeed, gorgeous. The rule book was not the best based on hearing it read out loud but game play was quite intuitive once everything was laid out which means it is also going to be very easy to explain to others if you had to by just referring to the start of game setup. We played a two player game and can imagine in gets much longer and a bit different in competitive flavor with more players. It's a quick- set-up and quick-play with two players which is exactly what we need right now.

An interesting mix of bluffing, probability, hand management and guesswork.

I must say as well that Asmodee have done an excellent job with the production/presentation of the game. It could easily have been a very dry abstract and the theme (thin though it is) works surprisingly well.

Before playing, the theme turned me off the game, but having played, it's hard to imagine any other theme here.

Very easy rules, and it is a light game, but not so easy as you can think from the rules.

There is bluffing and more control than you could think. 

Not oly important what card you will play, also what cards you will pass your neighbour during the game.

I wasn't excited about the description of Divinare ... it sounds a bit math-y and dull. My enjoyment of the game therefore came as a pleasant surprise. This is  a bit like a cross between Liar's Dice and Reiner Knizia's Quandary/Flinke Pink/Botswana. Divinare isn't a world-beater, but I'd recommend it as a filler game with some substance.Intuition and foresight play as much a role here as does math, which definitely saves this from being mundane in my book!

What a difference production values make.  Compare the finished Divinare to its prototype and you'll see what a layer of lacquer can do.  This is the cleanest execution of deduction and card drafting I've seen, yet my gaming group might not have noticed it without the Asmodee flair.  A single game rule forces each medium to change their prediction when they lay down a card, and that transforms this game from merely affable to deliciously devilish.

RATING: 7
This is an interesting little card game.  You get a hand of cards, then pass a few to the next player.  This gives you some information about what cards other players will play, which gives you a good chance at guess the the total number of cards that will be played in each suit.  Be careful of how many cards you have because you'll have to move your bid each time you play a card.  Very tricky.

RATING: 9
Of the small/fast games I own this is my favourite, although being a card game and with "bluffing" mechanics I would have never guessed I would like it this much if someone else hadn't made me play it at some point. The art is gorgeus, I admit it is responsible for part of my rating, but I think it is also great in other aspects... I actually don't understand how it has so little love (6.8 at this moment) when I see other games that deserve it lot less with higher scores... Anyway, Divinare is about making guesses on how many cards other players have in their hands and placing your bet on the table. At some point, twice per game, you exchange half of your cards with another player and you receive cards from another one, making it more tricky, since you need cards from a certain type to place a bet for that type (so there is the struggle between keeping this or that, planning what you are going to receive, etc).

A simple enough game that's startlingly good. Player play cards of one of four (different-total-number) colours,  each card player forced them to make or change their unique bet on the total number in the partial deck as well as 

During the game, half your hand is chosen to bepassed on to your neighbour, letting you both signal and dump cards you don't want. Points, positive or negative, are assigned to people who predict the total number of cards that were played in each suit.

Works really well, I wasn't expecting that much, but was very pleasantly surprised. I prefer the feel with 3 players, but 4 definitely works.

RATING: 6.5
It's a semi-deduction, semi-stock market guessing game.

In a four player game there are 36 cards, 6 red, 8 blue, 10 green and 12 yellow.  You deal out 6 cards to each player, leaving 12 out of the game.  

Each player, in turn order, plays a card to a color's area (yellow cards must go to the yellow board, etc.) and places his token on a guesstimate track there, guessing how many cards will be played in that color.  Every time you play a color you must change or remove your guesstimate.  

You get points for guessing exactly right (3 pts), guessing one off (1 pt), and bonuses if you correctly guess the answer and it happens to be on the extreme top or bottom of the possible distribution, i.e. if you guess all six red cards are coming out and are right.  You get dinged points for wrong guesses.

Initially you pass three of your six cards, then two of your four and then one of your two.  As the round gets closer and closer to ending you can usually get a better and better feel for the final values.

The best part for me was the theme, in which every player is a different style of fortune teller, which fit the game mechanic well.

As a light filler it was interesting... but just okay.  There's nothing particularly wrong with it, just that I'd rather be playing something else.

Divinare is a simple filler that does what it does well. It is short, functional but satisfying on some levels. Players try to divine the amount of cards in play from 4 different colors. The catch is, only 24 of the 36 cards are in play and the total number of cards for each color varies. By passing around cards from your hand three time each go around, players try to gauge how many types of cards are in play. The big twist to the game is that players also need to play cards of a particular color to place betting tokens around. Tokens have to be moved each round as cards are being played and so, it is often advantageous to pass along cards of a color where you do not want to move the tokens around. This creates some strategy in both card play and cards being passed around.
In the end, the game is short enough that even though one can lose the game due to bad choices or bad luck, it does not detract from a fun and short filler.

This was a pleasant surprise. I passed over it when it initially released because the elevator pitch didn't seem that interesting. Count some cards, pass a few to the left and then make a guess as to how many of each suit are in play. That's be a quick distraction, but certainly not something with any meat on it.

A friend of mine brought over a copy for me to try out and boy, was I wrong. The game is in the details. For starters, only one player is allowed to guess each specific value. Even if you know there are only 7 blue cards in play, if someone has already guessed that you have to go higher or lower, even if you know it's wrong. Secondly, players have to take turns revealing cards and every time they do so, they must change their guess for that number.

The result is a game that is only barely about card counting and mathing out the decks. It's about blocking spots, timing card plays, pushing your luck and reading your opponents. In short, this game is about five layers deeper than my initial read. I haven't been this engaged with a filler game since Biblios.

I don't really know what to make of this game. I enjoyed playing it, but after one play it's hard to work out how much control you have over what's going on, especially with your early card plays. In that respect, I approached it in much the same way I might approach 6 Nimmt - play a card and see what happens. However, I think that comparison does Divinare an injustice, since I sensed it had a greater depth and more opportunity for skilful play. I didn't really enjoy the memory element, trying to remember which cards I'd passed left and how many of each type I knew were in the game but given that it didn't really help my game, maybe I'd have been better off not counting cards too rigourously.

Great visual design, and one of the most confusing games I've played in a long while. But confusing in a good way - you can kinda make a plan and stick to some strategy, but at times you feel like you have no real information to go on. But I get the impression you have more control and information than I am aware of.

The kids really like this one. Which is a surprise, cause it is not marketed as a kid's game and the occult tarot theme may be off-putting to a lot of parents, but it isn't a scary theme. After playing this 15 times, I don't think there is a strategy, a five year old can win this game, it's that random. Strangely though, I don't mind playing it. That is the real mystery to this game....

Divinare is one of those games that is underrated. This bluffing game provides a flavour like no other game, it delivers a very thematic and yet abstract experience that involve Mediums and pshychics. As a strong filler is very good and the package and artwork is sublime very adjusted to the theme. It delivers more than you can think at the beggining. Personal favourite.

Game mechanic of increasing amount of information as the game progresses is strange, as it involves an increasing amount of memory work. There is also an element of take that in the final exchange of cards, which can be irritating. Having to move prediction tokens upon playing cards is also somewhat strange, especially when coupled with the final exchange of cards take that element. Artwork and game components are excellent though.

When this game was described to me, I groaned because a memory deduction game seemed very boring.  I was very surprised about how much fun this was.  If it was simply trying to guess what the actual numbers are, it would only rate a 6.  Where the game shines is choosing which cards to pass, when to play your cards, and where to place your markers so you end up where you want to be at the end of the turn.  Those sort of tactics made this a lot of fun and interesting.  A lot more going on despite the simple rules.

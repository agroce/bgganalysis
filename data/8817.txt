Very good artwork and card design. Let down by their being too many factions (and therefore too many cards to collect). Also, several expansions later, there are *still* 'unused' keywords. Keyword design could have been a *lot* tighter.

This game still holds a special place in my heart. Great artwork, clever resource system and some really good mechanics (except the timing structure). I‘m also a sucker for the power level of the CCG compared to the LCG.

Don't normally go for CCGs, but we know what cards we own and the general balance of our decks, and the theme is irresistible for me.
The resourcing turn is a clever mechanism, and the card powers are strongly based on the real Lovecraftian themes of  investigation, sanity loss, and combat with terrifying monsters that appear as time runs out.

An ok 2-player CCG that had some balancing issues. Will have to check out the LCG one day to see if it's a more balanced and thus fun version.

This is a very good game and FAR better than Magic in just about every respect. The flavour of Lovecraft and the Cthulhu Mythos is there, some nice artwork and card effects and ideas. The strategies are more in depth than appears at first glance.

Seems like a nice game with a nice theme, BUT it's a CCG, and I have no money (and really no desire) to start buying it. The situation on table can get really complex and that can lead to analysis paralys.

Theme, theme, theme!  And some pretty interesting gameplay to boot!  I really enjoyed my time with this one, and even organized my cards in a folder for easy deck building reference!  Denis and I played a fair amount before moving on to other things.  I think we bought a handful of cards from the first expansion, and that was the extent of it.  Denis has this unbeatable (by me anyway) deck that just foiled me and every attempt of mine to get anywhere in the game.  Never beat that deck, I would like to try sometime.  Great artwork and clever card rules that really tie in well with the theme of the card in question.

An interesting game, and I like a lot of the mechanics in it---plus the theme, of course.  But I'll never be as hot for this game as I am for Blue Moon, because the collectability and expense on this will skyrocket with further expansions.

I ended up buying a booster box and got bit by the poor distribution.  My box had the Ryleh distribution error, plus poor commons and uncommons distribution.

RATING: N/A
No rating--haven't had the opportunity to play it yet.  I've never been interested in CCGs previously (M:TG actually being a big turn-off in terms of theme, collectibility etc.)  CoC interested me due to the Lovecraftian theme, artwork and 'story' mechanic.  I don't plan to collect cards, and I purchased the Arkham Edition Premium Starter Set with that in mind.

Bought a few packs, but it wasn't Mythos reincarnated. There wasn't any local interest in the CCG. The LCG version has a few more proponents, although still not at critical mass.

This is the game mechanic that Star Trek needed to make mission-based CCG's compelling.  I do like the game and the mythos, so now I own the LCG starter.

I've enjoyed this more than any CCG I've played. I like how the story resolution works, and I like that since you can use any cards as resources on domains, you're not forced to devote a specific amount of your deck to such thing (as you would with land in Magic). And unlike 7th Sea, the other CCG I play semi-regularly, you don't have to spend half your game chasing after the other players.

I like card games and this one has (generally) great artwork. I don't think it's particularly inventive, but it's fun to play. It boils down to whether you dig the theme which I do.

Hmmm... another game which I wish I could give a split rating.

On the one hand, the card art is very nice and evocative of the Lovecraftian theme, and the game is kinda fun to play. The rules are simple once sorted out (FFG once again manages to publish a rulebook that is vague and grossly incomplete), and the game plays quickly and easily. The "resource" mechanic means nobody is ever mana-screwed (altough it's still quite Magic-derivitive), and makes for some interesting choices. Card cycle quickly enough to make things interesting, although as usual the "draw X" instead of "hand-filling" mechanics means the deck-builder has to heavily favor creatures and permanents over one-shot cards, the latter of which is usually what provides theme and excitement in one of these games. To tie into that latter thought, I must say that these CCGs get killed because designers seem unwilling to use dice. This game would be a lot more fun if there was some chance involved in the resolutions of conflicts (see the Middle-Earth CCG). Since there isn't, it's more about adding up combat factors, running all the possible permutations, and working out the best counter-move for your opponent, which while it might be interesting, is a theme-killer. In fact, I'd say that the theme here does not extend past the (admittedly very nice) card art.

Anyway, after playing once, I was thinking "yeah, I could see buying a few cards and building a deck or two. That might be fun. I haven't done a CCG in ages, and I used to enjoy them." Then you run into the buzz-saw of CCG pricing. $3.50 for a booster pack? If this were about half to a third of the cost, I'd probably buy. But it's not, so I think I'll stick with Blue Moon and Middle Earth: The Wizards.

As an after-thought, I think this game has too many factions, and I suspect that some of them are very unbalanced in classic FFG style. It takes major purchases to get enough cards to have enough to do serious deck-building (because you need to get enough cards for each faction to have options, and with 8 factions, that'll take a while if you don't trade heavily). This is another thing that ME:TW did well, as it had only resource and hazard cards, and your deck needed both anyway.

RATING: 7
great ccg. I bought a load of cards when the ccg first came out but never really played it with my mtg group. played it a few times recently and theres a lot going on. Currently I prefer it to MTG having burned out with that after 15 years of playing it.
The only thing I never understood was why you mix the good guys and bad guys together?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Rating is after one play.

This game seems good enough after one play for me to give it an average rating.  I might even prefer it over M:TG (since I'm a bit over M:TG these days), and its mechanics seem a bit fresher.

If you like Magic, you'll like this.

RATING: 8
Fantastic theme and nice mechanics. 

Fighting over stories gives the game a different feel to Magic. I would say that because of the story mechanic this one is strictly two player with have tried with more many times but it kind of falls apart, which is a shame. It uses the more recent mechanic that all cards can be used as resources, which is good. It does however use pass-pass, which I personally dislike. I think being able to respond to actions your opponents plays with a stack makes for more tactically interesting games. 

The game does suffer from some balance issues with several cards being overpowered. A lot of these are common and uncommon though. It has a mix of some highly desirable rares and a lot of totally pointless rares. Some cards say things that are so ridiculously specific and might as well say "If it is saturday and there is an easterly wind and nightingales can be heard calling, destroy target character." 

The stories are resolved by 4 icon struggles followed by a skill struggle. The mix of icons on each card makes these altercations exciting. Some times it is a bit strange that a couple of guys with guns go up against an elder god and the elder god is the one taking the wound. It does work somehow though and the theme does come through. In the late game things can be a bit sloppy as there are just too many creatures on the board and it breaks down into analysis paralysis and serious arithmatic has to be done. 

Having said that despite its problems, which are the same as most CCGs, it is great fun and the artwork is fantastic.

Although I'm a fan of CCG's I wasn't sure about the new CoC card game. However after more than a few games I have come to the opinion that this not a bad game. The rules are basic and simple and gameplay is fast. Its only drawback is that despite being a game based upon the works of HP Lovecraft, it does not do a paticularly good job of conveying that during play.

RATING: 6
I hate the collectible rip-off, I think it's the worst that ever happened to gaming but the Lovecraft theme and card art on this one was irresistable.  That being said, there's also an awesome and fun game here with really tight, ingenious resource management (borrowed from San Juan, no less!) and tons of great tactical opportunities.  Having grown weary of the non-stop glut of German games that basically limit your decision making options to just a few things, it's been nice to come back to something wild, wooly, and wide open like CoC.  I think it's entirely playable without power cards, but it is almost impossible to resist getting more- Dagon might be in that next booster you open!  If this were released in the Blue Moon format of expansion decks, I'd give it a ten and dub it a modern classic.

I've enjoyed the game a lot so far, but lack the experience yet to know if it will go up or down after further plays.  Cleanest mechanics I've seen on a CCG yet, plus it's no longer collectable which is a plus.

RATING: 7
Rules seem fairly unique and allow for interesting decisions. Will have to play more to decide more. This could be anywhere from a 6 to a 9.

One concern: I won by virtue of Nick having no cheap characters. Seems a bit lopsided.

Also, I suppose it suffers from the 'problem' with these games in that customisation could eat into both time and money.

Incredible art, and the mana system is brilliant, but the high expected mortality rate of characters and their uninspired design (blob, other blob, detective guy) make it so you can't get emotionally involved in the game.

RATING: 6
Starter decks only.  Solid CCG, players spend cards to build up a resource "energy" which is tapped during a turn to bring other cards into play.  The idea is to build up characters, which are committed to stores, and can be countered by your opponent's characters.  A battle of sorts takes place, with the winner getting to place tokens on the story card.  Five tokens claims the story, three stories wins the game.  Works well, pretty simple to learn.

RATING: 6
This is a fun and fast paced CCG, even for control-oriented decks, in my opinion.  It's resource management is the most interesting I've seen yet in a game.  Competing with your opponent over stories is interesting with it's multi-struggle phases, causing characters to 'untap', wound/die, or even go insane.  Recently this became an LCG which takes a lot (but not all) of the expensive collecting edge out of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Four criticisms: 1. This game lacks variety in "stories."  The game allows only 10 stories, which seem virtually identical to one another. 2. The game fails to evoke the feel of Lovecraft's writing -- doesn't stimulate the imagination. 3. The rules are badly written -- filled with errors in grammar and usage -- annoying. 4. The game doesn't break any new ground -- the essential mechanics of the game have been around for fifteen years. Recommendation: if you are interested in Lovecraft's writings, get Mythos instead.

A really fun dueling card game featuring monsters, mobsters, strange rituals, space aliens, mad university professors, archeologists, and corrupt police.  A game takes about 30-45 minutes; you'll want to play again.  I have about 600 cards from both the CCG and LCG editions, all mixed together so that everybody can pick their factions and have a good time.  I've removed a few overpowered and underpowered cards, and the Night and Day cards too.  I don't do deck building, I just make sure everybody's supplied with a good stock of weapons and monstrosities - let the dark festivities begin!

[2 starters, 12 boosters] CoCCCG has the honor of being the first CCG I've spent $50+ on since MtG. It's pretty, it's different, and it works pretty well. It's still a CCG though, so don't kvetch about that since you already knew that going in eh? If you were going to spend that cash on Blue Moon, forget it and get some CoCCCG cards instead. More later.

Decent theme but the mechanics fall a bit short. There's a feeling of shoving against the other guy as hard as you can over the available adventures, with tension building up, and then something suddenly snaps and the game is over. I'd prefer a more gradual resolution than this "bang, you're dead" feeling ... but I like the theme and would likely get pretty deep into it if I had a local group of guys actively into the game.

I was pretty impressed by the demo I got. I like the LCG model a lot, and the rules seemed to be very crisp and easy to grasp, but with plenty of good choices also.

Rating is quite tentative, but I would like to play again.

RATING: 8
Successfully evokes the feeling of the [i]Call of Cthulhu[/i] RPG as a desperate race against time and horrible attrition.  Investigators form up into teams and pile into stories and you just have to hope that enough of them survive to get some work done.  For the Mythos player, it's about meeting the Investigators halfway with a couple of really awful monsters to drive them insane and eat the leftovers.  A fun little diversion, but I just can't bring myself to get on the CCG whirligig again.  [i]Ever[/i].

Score reflects play with unmodified starter decks.

UPDATE:  FFG has released a "Premium Starter Set" with two pre-constructed decks.  This is THE way to play for those of us paralyzed by CCGophobia.  Recommended.

This is a very good game.  The game play is subtle and the evaluations of options can get quite complex if one wishes to play well. It may be too heavy a game for some people since one must typically take into account the details of every active card controlled by each player in order to make the right challenge decisions. The challenge mechanic has the feel of Mystick, and the potential card interactions and resource management are indebted to MTG.

I am not really that big a fan of Lovecraft but the gameplay and mechanics of this game have really got me hooked.  The artwork is great, rules are clear-cut, and the timing rules are very straight-forward without making gameplay overly facile.  The game is extremely draft-friendly as any card could also potentially be a resource card.  My favorite way to play this is to mix the cards from a booster box or two and then do a Rochester draft of them and then play.  You can have fun with this game without a "turbo-tuned" constructed deck.  The draftability of this game is what earns a 10 for me.  I've gotten a ton of replayability out of just trying to make the best out of what I can draft.

The game balance is great because the numbers are from 1 to 4 with the big boys not being so insanely powerful that they can't be overcome. In the end though, I just can't handle 2-out-of-3 as a means to end a game. It makes me feel like I strive really hard with all of this rich detail and atmosphere but the game ends on a school-yard victory condition.

RATING: 7.5
[2007.Oct.11] This Fantasy Flight Games offering is a solid card game that simply oozes with theme. It builds upon (and corrects) the flaws of first-generation CCGs, like [i]Magic: The Gathering[/i], while at the same time elegantly incorporating recurring Cthulhu mythos-specific themes like insanity and investigation into the core of the game. Gone are the days of first-generation CCG issues like 'mana' shortages or over-production. In [i]Call of Cthulhu[/i], all cards may be turned into resources [literally turned upside down], or simply used as they were meant to be: as cards in the game itself. Also, the game is no longer offered as a [i]collectible[/i] game (although the initial sets and expansions were, in fact, collectible); this is a huge plus, especially for the future longevity of this niche card game. All-in-all a worthy game, especially for card gamers or Cthulhu enthusiasts.

An above-average CCG that's quick to learn, plays smoothly, and is surprisingly un-fiddly. The "icon struggle" mechanic is very clever, and necessitates lots of careful planning and tactical shifts. Minor complaints: spell and event cards are under-powered and far too rarely used to be much of a factor in the game, and the absence of "stories" to differentiate the Story Cards in flavor text or anywhere else represents an inexplicable missed opportunity.

This is a really fun game.  I am SO glad it is losing the CCG format and going to LCG.  I can see where SOE got most of the ideas for the Legends of Norath game.  I can't wait to get the LCG starter set.

Whoa - I had high expectations from reading the rules, but the actual play (with two normal starters and no boosters) pretty much blew me away. Unless there are overpowered cards or combos somewhere in the set, this is a CCG that definitely places the emphasis on playing the game and not designing decks. This one will get played a lot, I'm sure.

Every once in a while I pick up a starter for a CCG to see if I want to a) put in the effort to play it and b) put in the even greater effort required to convince someone else to put in the effort to play it.

I don't think this one will make the cut--the art and theme just don't grab me, and the mechanics didn't strike me as being particularly novel.

The Mythos CCG was way more faithful to Lovecraft's works.  Thematically, Call of Cthulhu seems to be a disappointing pastiche.

The theme is what first drew me to this.  I'm a fan of the entire mythos sub genre.  I've dabbled in CCG's previously(Was into Magic '94-'96, played some Illuminati NWO and 7th Sea as well).  The artwork is well done with a consistent style, and frequently nice little touches that someone familiar with the mythos will appreciate if they pay close attention.  The game plays well.  The resource drought/flood design issue that can plague CCG's is resolved(for the most part) by a system in which all cards can serve as resources(at the cost of not being able to use the cards printed ability).  There still can be an issue if you draw no characters, but since characters in a typical deck would be the most numerous card type it isn't as big an issue.  The game is resolved in terms of story cards. Each turn, players commit characters to stories, in an attempt to win struggles and place tokens on the stories.  First player to five tokens on a story wins it(and can invoke the power of the story if they choose... these powers are typically large effects on all players...so it's important to see if that positive story card helps you or your opponent more, or if the negative card hurts you or your opponent more).  It's a good game, but nothing that will make a die-hard CCG hater change their mind.  If you like the theme and enjoy CCG's(either dabbling in them or going gung-ho) then this will probably be a good choice.

This game being collectible means the gameplay is fundamentally broken.  The process of figuring out what combinations are better is a puzzle not a game.  Sitting by yourself constructing a deck is the definition of solitary play (a puzzle).

Beyond that the business model of collectible games is deplorable.  It is a form of gambling targeted towards children.  It adds no benefit to the gameplay is done specifically to milk as much money from people as possible.

Played once and only half a game from thr Arkham Edition Premium Starter Set.  Good art, OK play.  Need more plays to see how it really does.  Mechanics fit better here than they do used in AGoT CCG.  But the problem I have with both games is it doesn't feel like you are DOING anything.  So I won a story card.  What does that mean?  Very tepid compared to ransacking provinces or stealing agenda.  But maybe not a bad design...

Very elegant card game.  Some card combo's however completely destroy the mood (ever seen Cthulhu in a Packard car wielding a tommy gun?  ;-) Thought so...)

Heavily unbalanced in favour of two of the factions. There were attempts to fix this in the expansions, but ufoutunately at the cost of the theme of some of the factions.
Power creep (surge, actually) in each expansion was ridiculous.
Still, some nice touches exist. I like how you compete for the scenarios in the center of the game. It's also nice how you in the begining must choose between adding a card as a resource or try to get it into play.

RATING: 9.5
Bar none this is my favorite CCG of all time.  The resourcing and cost mechanic is innovative, amazing, and leads to incredibly tense choices.  Deckbuilding is easier because of the cost mechanic, but then it begins to show the difference between who's good and who's great.

The art is always amazing and I love to see characters from the Mythos come to life.  I especially love when they're abilities truly capture the feel of the character, which happens quite often IMO.

Lastly, the play of the game is incredibly tense and filled with many critical decisions.  I love how the story struggles center the action of the game, and I love messing with people after having committed.

For me, the best part about this game is the huge number of decisions to be made throughout the course of play.  This game truly rewards the good player.  You can't just find a decklist online and start winning with it.  There is no such thing as a deck that plays itself, and so each win is much more gratifying.

The only problem I have is that even though the resourcing/cost mechanic is one of my favorites ever, it has serious weaknesses.  There's no way to make a card cost half a resource, and because of that many cards which would otherwise be very cool end up being unbalanced.  The shift from 1 to 2, 2 to 3, or 3 to 4 is a *much* bigger jump in cost than it would appear at first glance.  So sometimes cards are slightly undercosted making them too powerful, or overcosted, making them useless.  But that is my only complaint in an otherwise amazing game.

I've played this game every week since it came out and I will continue to do so long after they stop making cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I like the game also if it's a bit too cold, abstract and mathematic for my tastes. Maybe also a bit too brainstorming when a lot of cards are in play.
The resource system is original but has some flaws in my opinion - expensive cards become worthless.

I find very strange to mix 'good' and 'evil' factions together - having Cthulhu, scientists and policemen fighting all together is really weird, heavily anti-thematic and I don't like it.
To solve that I created seven mono-faction decks, quite powerful, to play with friends.

The artwork is good, the layout awesome.
I have all the CCG's existing cards.

I admit to having a deep bias against all of FFG's CCG products, despite whatever quality may or may not be therein.  Beta tested this one, and again FFG makes a game that captures the flavor of the theme, but overpowers some game mechanics in the intial year's expansions of a CCG.

Seems like a solid system;  there are a lot of parallels with Lang's other CCG/LCG design AGoT.  Hoping to pick up a set of the new LCG soon; can't comment on competitive play but the one downside is that the way the system is set-up it seems as if it is way better to attack than sit back on defense, lowering the interaction between players and making games relatively short.

Players go head-to-head trying to "complete" three "story cards".  Every card in a player's deck may be used as the card itself or used instead as a currency to bring cards out.  Characters in the player's tableau may be killed, or driven insane (lose 2 turns).  The player decision of using a card for what it can do versus burying the card in order to use it to bring more cards out is the point of tension in the game and really challenges a player's strategy and knowledge of their deck.

I love this game. I was an avid Magic: TG gamer some years ago, playing in tournaments and knowing the game at a high level. I quit playing Magic: TG and now I've discovered this great game.
In terms of gameplay, the ongoings of a game are much more interesting, and create much more tension, than a Magic game. Rules are easy and fun. As well, a deck works much better only with common and uncommon cards than Magic:TG, so you don't need to spend a lot of money to start playing.
I completely recommend this, and don't even think about playing it if you are fan of Lovecraft's novels!

I played the CCG before it became an LCG.  I do love all the different strength symbols on the cards as I feel it makes the game more multi-dimensional.

I'm enjoying this so far, the Lovecraft universe is rich and FF is making good use of it so far. Rules are easy to follow, and the game play flows pretty smoothly. Typical for CCGs card rarity does tip the balance of power to an extent, but not the worst that I've seen. Some of the cards are extremely powerful and possible game breakers, further playings will decide for certain.

I never dabbled in CCGS years ago and I am reluctant at times to try them out due to the money pit aspect.  HOWEVER - playing Glory to Rome, Race for the Glaxy, and Dominion so much in 2008 has cracked the door open to trying out pure card games - games without a "board".

I am intirigued by the Living Card Game (LCG) concept and looked into Game of Thrones and Call of Cthulhu.  Glad I did get to play it and fortunately I am at a spot where I picked up the rules of game play a little easier than when I tried to learn Magic a while back.  Want to try the drafting version.  This appears to be a very solid game after a few plays and looking forward to more plays even though I don't play much 2p stuff.

I liked this game as a bit of a diversion, but there is not enough depth here for me to play it seriously. It feels a little non-interactive, more like you are racing your opponent than actually combating them. There are some exceptions of course (the shotgun blast card) but typically there aren't many effective ways to mow down guys on your opponents side of the board. As such, the game feels more like a symbol matching exercise than a battle of the Elder Gods. My feelings for the game also came down a couple notches after I was exposed to the Game of Thrones CCG.  AGoT uses a system obviously evolved from Call of Cthulhu, yet sporting far more strategy, interaction and depth.

I bought this on a whim at Gen Con, after a really fun and interesting demo. After playing through a box of boosters, I was really disappointed with the variety the game offered. There are a lot of cards that have different titles, yet are functionally identical. This felt like somewhat lazy game design, especially when compared to games like L5R, Magic, VS, and WOW. Those games have produced thousands of original cards before duplicating effects. Call of Cthulhu isn't a bad game, but as I mentioned above, now I think I would just rather play A Game of Thrones.

This was the first post-M:TG card game I tried and it was a welcome breath of fresh air. The resource mechanics were brilliant. All of your cards could double as a resource which added a unique level of strategy. You were constantly forced to strategically choose between playing a card as a resource, or playing it as a normal card. Awesome game.

Played once. While the game definitely has a solid CCG basis, a strong theme (although not one I am very fond of) and nice illustrations, I haven't been struck by anything extraordinary about it - at least nothing which dragged me more into it.

Just got the 2 premium starters.
Really fun, quite simple, but the good kind of simple.

Hmm.  Positives:  the artwork is good.  I love the "San Juan like" aspect to the game where any card can be used/played as an energy source of the color of the card -or- be played as what the card is (it removes the too much/little land issue of Magic:tG). Negatives:  the prebuilt decks are fun but they soon leave you wanting more.  If you want to play a 2 faction 50 card deck (20, 20, and 10 colorless for instance) with colors other than what comes with a prebuilt deck you need to buy many (15 or more?) booster packs (since their are 8 factions in the game it takes many 11 card boosters to get 20 cards of each color)  This makes this a rather expensive ($50?) game to begin to dabble in. Of course you can buy less and trade your way to only a couple factions (if you can be satisfied with only playing some of them) but be aware of this limitation. (and of course it gets worse if you try to get certain cards for certain strategies)  But if you don't mind the price this is one of the best CCGs out there.

Full of atmosphere.  The stakes escalate every turn until somebody gets to the tipping point.

It's a ccg so it carries all the cons associated with non-Magic ccgs. Not enough fanatical players in your area, a trillion cards you must know and understand. The cost of gaining such cards, etc.

But, if this were a non-collectible card game, would it be good? I think it is an interesting way to play a game around the Lovecraft mythos, but there is proabbly still a better game waiting to be made.

(Trade Interest: medium) a little hard to read the rules, but some of the ideas are clever.  not enough to save it though.

Got 5 starters and 3x 23 boosters for 25€, all sealed. A few plays in, and I think it's a good game.

I really love the theme of this game and prefer the goal of winning stories opposed to killing your opponent which is what most CCG's rely on.

The one big downside is that it can only be played with two people.  So unfortunately it tends to get skipped more than I would like for other games with a higher player cap.

I'm attempting to distance myself from CCGs, hence the cool rating.  Still, the game has a lot to offer, and the whole stories/struggles mechanisms are neat and allow for different strategies.  Somewhat derivative of the Game of Thrones CCG, but that's OK.

I have played just a couple of games with the starters. Game seems interesting, but the first games didn't hooked me as much as first plays with other ccg's I've played.

I want to get into this really bad, but I have no prior experiences with CCG's so it might be a bit tough.  We'll see after the Christmas funds come in....

RATING: 10
The more we play, the more we appreciate the superb mechanics. The struggles provide real conflict and interaction, and its as thematically strong a game as any Lovecraft fan could hope for. The artwork is absolutely incredible and on the whole is consistently superb. A real feeling of helplessness is always felt by investigators going it alone against the forces of darkness, but likewise a nice sense of achievement is felt when they are beaten back to wherever they came from...

An interesting CCG with a great theme (of course). The goal of winning 3 story cards feels a bit strange, a bit hard to control or manipulate. The end of the game sometimes feels like it comes too quickly. I think I'm not a big fan of games that take the goal of the game and compress it too much. This game is one example, with another being Fist of Dragonstones (score 3 points). Maybe if the goal was place 15 control markers (which is sort of kinda the same thing) I'd like it even more.

Good game but not as good as "A Game Of Thrones CCG", I think the luck factor is bigger here.

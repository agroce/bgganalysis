I have raised my rating with repeated two-player games.  Family/filler that reminds me of a combination of Cartegena and Yucata.  Pleasant for a short diversion into a lite tactical game.  Probably a little deeper than it first appears (at least for two players), but still not very deep.  The more players the more chaotic it becomes.  Although dominated by luck, the game is full of tension and excitement.

Light hand-management game.  No tough decisions, but engrossing enough that you must pay attention.

Traded away.

RATING: 7
Typical lighter Knizia fare, but one with enough decisions to be made. It's always possible to come back from behind, although it may be costly. Not a must-have for the fanatics because it doesn't offer anything new or exciting.

RATING: 6
A racing set-collection game.  The leap-frogging is a decent catch up mechanism, though far from perfect.  With more players, I suspect the game is more chaotic and less even-handed.  A 5-player game of this left me feeling like I had very little control over the outcome.  Even so, there are plenty of choices to make.  Not very deep, very little strategy at work.  An okay game that I might play again if in the right mood (I suppose).

Some basic, clever fun can be had in this race game where leapfrogging your opponents on the road to the end goal seems to be half the fun.  Collect cards of different colors, with different symbols on them, and use sets of those cards to move along a road where each spot on the road requires a particular set of these cards to move onto.  

In our first game, at different points in the game, one player would tend to massively hoard cards rather than move, then make a massive, somewhat confusing, move across long stretches of the board.  That seemed to diminish the enjoyment of the game, and I wonder if the game might be improved a tad with a hand limit in place.  All in all, this is a cute race game with some laughter to be had for all, but might need some fine tuning or house rules.

RATING: 8.5
A great little filler game (but too crowded with 5). Has a card mechanism similar to Knizia's Lord of the Rings. It's a terrific game with people you know because you're trying to guess when they're risk threshold has been reached and they'll make a move that might benefit you.

{3 plays} The others I played with liked this more than I did.  I thought it was just okay... and that rating is likely to drop with subsequent play.  Knizia's take on Cartegena should be MUCH better than this.  I'd rather play Cartegena.

RATING: 5
Right now I'm just really unsure about Marco Polo Expedition. The game mechanics seemed just fine, until I was suddenly left behind by four spaces, and since I had been planning for not those four spaces but some spaces further on down the line, I found it impossible to catch up to the pack. Maybe it was just the five-player game -- I'd like to try it with three sometime and see if it adds tightness to the game -- but I definitely was unhappy with how the game turned out.

Első játék után katasztrófális volt a véleményem a játékról. Hozzáteszem egy buliban játszottuk, mindenki beszélgetett, közben gondolkodás nélkül lépkedtünk. Igazán primiitív és unalmas játéknak tűnt. De gondoltam, mielőtt eladom, kap még egy esélyt (mégiscsak Knizia). Nekiültünk hárman, és ...nem is rossz. Egész bonyolult tud lenni, nagyon nem egyértelmű ennyi játék után, mi lehet a jó stratégia. Nem adom el:)

An adequate game but it feels much more like a card game than a board game and I mean a tradtional old card game like rummy. The board is pretty much there to track the movement and tell you what set of cards you need to collect next.

Not a lot of strategy or tactics, more luck of the draw.  Might be a good game to introduce people familiar with card games to the board gaming hobby.

Warning: this rating is based on only one play.  We were really looking forward to this game as it sounded right up our alley.  Then we had a chance to play it (4-player) at an exhibition and were really disappointed.  It's not terrible, but it just wasn't fun to play and took way too long for what it is.

RATING: 6
Good game, usually willing to play. Has a pleasant feel with meaningful choices. I like that it's a bit of a race game, but not exactly... To me, race games have an intrinsic flaw, so I appreciate the way this and a few others negotiate that subjective flaw with creative design (see Royal Turf, Around the World in 80 Days). Lots of choices, wondering what other players are up to... To me, a lot of the criticism of this game (like Beowulf) is misplaced, as there is a push-your-luck element: make my move this turn , or wait another couple turns to collect cards for a better move and risk another player making the move.  Moving first can screw up other player's card collection strategy. Also, balancing somewhat against the wait-in-the-back-of-the-line strategy, the chests on the board reward you to move first. If you can move ahead, then put some extra space between you and the line of camels behind you, you foil the lurkers. I consider the lurking strategy a good one, but also obvious. A good thing about the advantages of being last in line, and the catch-up mechanism of the half-way point, keep everyone in play. The last game I played, a person near the back in chest scoring, and in the changing position on the map, came forward for a triumphant win at the end. The artwork and bits are lovely and clear. A gaming friend says this is her favorite game. Me, I will suggest it once in a while, and oblige if others suggest it.

RATING: 3
A great game for kids, but for adults I just don't see the appeal...yes, there are opportunities for good play when you can jettison goods in trade for fast moves; but the matching system really breaks the game down into being able to draw what you need, when you need it, and hoping the other players don't foil all of that build up. The final square is also extremely silly with everyone being forced to sit around and draw cards until someone happens to get a set of 4. If there was a way to get more than 1 card a turn this might have some potential, but as it stands it's plodding for a light game, and just doesn't have much going on. Feels like a light version of Ticket which feels like a light version of Elfengold...

German rules are badly translated to Estonian. There is no remark that you can move your piece more then once in a turn. Also, before reading English rules from Boardgamegeek, it was unclear, how can you use load drop feature. English translation is great and clear - added value for us!

What a terrible waste of energy and resources. Draw cards, form silly sets, move token, repeat. Oh, now I need three of this kind, and four of those. Whatever for? I haven't a clue. Wait, well, no, not exactly: you have to be a bit careful and guesstimate where you want to end up so you can selectively draw the cards you need. Don't draw the cards you need? Then it's [i]Oh, look, I'm falling behind, and I lack the cards and money to keep up. You guys in the lead have fun now, y'hear?[/i] I can only hope that the bloke who let Reiner Knizia present him this pile of game dung was fired shortly after so that he wouldn't be able to tarnish the name of Ravensburger further. And Reiner himself won't walk away from this design without a few burn and switch marks either.

[COLOR=#990000]**[Español** Esta es la versión Rummikub de Knizia. El aspecto de planificarse que usa este juego y otros como el Beowulf, Elfenland, Maharaja... siempre he dicho que es un buen mecanismo.

Este en juego en cuestión puede ser un buen juego para gente muy poco jugadora y a la que no le gustan los números. Creo que es mejor jugarlo entre 2 (o 3) personas.

Personalmente lo jugaría muchas veces sin cansarme ya que la faceta multiuso de las cartas me hace recordar al Battle Line y al Blue Moon City y la puntuación final a pesar de ser muy simple puede tener mucha intriga.

Si te gusta este juego también es conveniente que le eches un ojo a los siguientes: Schotten Totten, Battle Line, Lost Cities, Medici, Marco Polo Expedition y la serie de 10 days.[/COLOR]

I often say that there is no room in my collection for OK games.  Well, after one play, I'd say that this game is much better than just OK--I thought it was really a lot of fun, and intend to add it to my next order.  I tend to like elegant tactical games, and this fits the bill nicely.

Components: Colorful cards, attractive board, sturdy camels. The treasure chests are too similar looking.

Experience: Interesting hand management, trying to decide when to advance and when to draw. The real enjoyment comes from trying to plan ahead, taking into account the possible actions of the other players, and to keep one's hand as flexible as possible. Absolutely brutal to the player in last, who might have no opportunity to leap frog with the others.

RATING: 7
Players join the Polo's caravan, and attempt to claim the most gold in their journey to Kublai Khan's palace.  Progress is made along a linear track, paying a card cost to enter the next free space on the track - occupied spaces are simply jumped over.  You can also give up a gold to make a jump for "free".  Tricky in that if you lead progress is slow, but you claim the treasures sprinkled over the board, and if you trail then you get the bonus of leap-frogging those ahead of you.  There is an intermediate scoring triggered half way through the game that lets everyone catch up (where the Polo's lingered for a year).  It reminded me a bit of Elefantenparade, a bit of Hase und Igel, etc.  As with nearly all Knizia games, worth a look.

Overlooked hand-management race game that really deserves more attention. Players leap-frog past each other, collecting sets of matching cards to advance along the Spice Road. A tricky and more-or-less friendly little race game. Highly recommended for new families and for mixed groups of veterans and new gamers.

RATING: 5
At first I thought this was a racing game based on hand management.   Then, I decided it's more of a game of Camel Leapfrog.  You collect the required sets of cards to advance to the next space.   What's odd is that it has hints of Ticket To Ride in it.

RATING: 5
Szett gyűjtögetős "race" játék kicsit nyögvenyelős módon. A kereskedők versenyében történő előrejutást a helyszíneken meghatározott szettek (1-2-3-4 azonos bármilyen színű áru, 1-2 bármilyen színű karavánvezető, 2-3 azonos színű lap, 4 különböző áru, 5 különböző színű lap) felhasználásával történik. Egy helyszínen egyszerre csak egy kereskedő állhat, így előrejutáshoz a következő üres mezőn meghatározott szettet kell felhasználni, ami egy 5 fős játéknál erősen megváltozhat mire újra ránk kerül a sor, így az embernek folyamatosan az az érzése, hogy nem jóra gyűjt. A felzárkózást segíti az 1 arany értékű pénzesláda befizetésével történő előrejutás (ezzel a módszerrel természetesen nem lehet az élre törni), illetve a verseny közepén történő kiértékelést követő "verseny újrakezdés". A játék nem túl hosszú, de én szett gyűjtögetős mechanikával a Ticket to Ride-t sokkal jobban kedvelem. (2017.12.27.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Surely this is the perfect game for introducing non-gamers to the gaming hobby. It is extrememly easy to teach and grasp, but being a Knizia game, it has enough subtle strategies to keep experienced gamers interested. 

It also utilized numerous mechanisms to stall runaway leaders: the leapfrogging aspect for one. Also, a player who gets too far ahead will find herself without any cards, while her opponent has a fistful. Finally, the chests make it easy to catch up (for a small price) when you fall behind.

If the game has one fault, it is the end game. Specically, the end game goes a bit too far to ensure that the leader can still be dethroned. Unless you are ahead by a significant amount, the luck of the draw can really kill you in the last two spaces on the board. Our games typically come down to all players trying to draw the fourth market good in a set, and the first who succeeds typically wins the game. This feels a bit out of place with the rest of the game, where micromanaging small gains and losses is of utmost importance.

Still, a very good game overall. The theme, while tacked on, works well. The components are very nice. The box is much larger than it really needs to be (I could easily have seen this done as a $20 Fantasy Flight silver line game) but it does add to the appeal. From now on, this will be the game I suggest when introducing newbies to the world of Eurogames.

A very Knizia game by Knizia.  While you can go off and runaway for a while, the unusual ways in which you help your opponents in the process catch up to you instantly.  Keep in mind that the winner is the wealthiest player and not necessarily the fastest and furthest along.  Key here is hand management and a clear eye for the opportunities at hand.  Lots of fun.

I like the artwork and components in this game.  The game itself has a nice little challenge of card management and playing 'Leap Frog' to get ahead of the other players.  I heard someone compare this to 'Around the World in 80 Days' but this game is just a touch deeper and more interesting to play.  I am not sure why people are calling this 'a kid's game' since it is similar in weight to Ticket to Ride, and yes, you can come from behind and win.

RATING: 7.5
Three plays, one with three and two with four. A great little game—nice components, simple rules, and the game play is fast and interesting. Cards are used to move ahead on the track and jump over opponents, but since the card requirements for the spaces differ, players need to to plan ahead and try to have a flexible hand in case their opponents do something unexpected. A little luck doesn't hurt either.

I'm surprised by the relatively low opinion of this one on BGG. I think the problem might be the misguided theory that the optimal way to play the game is to hoard cards until you can shoot far ahead of everyone else. Yes, if everything works out, it will be hard for others to jump you, but at the same time you can't jump anyone either. Everyone receives the exact same number of cards over the course of the game, and the best way to get ahead of other players in terms of resources is to have opportunities to jump them. To hoard cards for the purpose of shooting ahead of everyone else so that no one can leapfrog you is cutting off your nose to spite your face; if the players behind you switch gears and make a lot of short leapfrog hops they will quickly catch up without having spent anywhere near as many cards as you have. Get it?

As you might imagine, fewer players means more control. I probably wouldn't bring it out if there were five at the table.

This is a nice classic, simple yet deceiving game. 

It's a race, but you have keep a good watch on how to win, while collecting the right cards. And remember others may jump ahead of you taking the spot YOU wanted to advance to. Very nail biting game, while you rush to get points, any points. Very tense decisions for such a simple game. And it doesn't overstay its welcome. Plus the camels are pretty and "wooden" chests look great. Overall great game that can be played quickly.

superior camels in this game to be sure.  (note from 2005:  this one has gone up a notch.  We played a fantastic game of this, fraught with tension and take that...it was good!){note from 2004: The gameplay was lackluster, however, and the mechanic extremely reminiscent of Galloping Pigs.  Galloping Pigs is more fun and lots less expensive.)

Excellent game. Can be played lightly and quickly, but has some potential for deeper analysis. Tension is sustained all the time - very good.

I was pleasantly surprised by this game.  This is kind of a "Beowulf light".  You can see what is coming up on the board and anticipate your opponents' moves.  It is very light and would be a very good family game, teaching planning and hand management.  The theme is nonexistent, but the game plays quickly enough that the lack of theme is not bothersome.  I think the components are nice and the movement mechanism is relatively unique, encouraging players to bunch up together - never falling too far behind.  It seems difficult to catch the leader, but that could be due to lack of experience.

An excellent filler game. From first reading, I thought it was going to be like Elefantenparade but the game was so much better. Players try to race across the desert by completing sets of cards. The theme of keeping pace with opponents camels to help move through terrain was well-implemented. A non-gamer commented that he really loved the tension in the game. Better than TTR, he said.

My only complaint was with the stupid treasure chests and their hard-to-see stripes.

Played this again after a long break since last year's Origins.  A light, but enjoyable set collection game with some strategy involved that won't burn the brain, but is enough to keep you interested.  It was very interesting playing it with 3 new people, and seeing what strategies they employed, and how they read their opponents.  In some respects, it plays like poker to me, you are trying to read your opponent, only you not only want to know what he has, but WHEN he wants to play his cards.  If you can count cards, you definitely have an advantage, but there is enough luck factor and player interaction to keep a card counter from breaking the game.  This will likely become a regular "filler" game with our group now that I found a copy.  Updated-  Played this with 3 tonight, and it seems much more bland without the additional interaction.  Strongly suggest a minimum of 4 to enjoy this game.

RATING: 6
Hand management as one seeks to complete sets of different types.  Each card has a color and is either a caravan or a product card (4 different products).  Different spaces require different types of sets to move.  If you fall back too far in this "race", you are likely to be out of the game in the early going.  Rules are well laid out and are easy to learn.

This title is a race game where you are hoping to get that set you need and then right before you play it someone else drops it. The trick is to try to be that someone else and not the person left with a bunch of cards that was a great hand 20 seconds ago. A good and angsty game.

This is a great game for younger children. I introduced it to my niece who is six years old and she enjoyed it. For older players however, this game falls flat. It doesn't feel like you can control much of what is going on, and once everyone adopts a hoarding strategy it only becomes a matter of luck draw.

The game suffers from a serious "run-away loser" problem.  Once a player has fallen behind by two or more spaces from the caravan, there is almost no way to catch up.  The problem is accentuated by the intermediate pay-out phase, which awards $$ to players in the lead, and little (possibly none) to the players in the rear.  Because $$ is a primary way to catch up when a player is behind, it is quite possible for a player to find themselves out of the money in the intermediate pay-out, and then completely unable to draw up to the rear of the caravan.

Not one of my favourite Knizia games but it is quite interesting and has some tough decisions.  Players collect cards and use them to leap-frog their opponents within the caravan.  You're trying to get in front to collect treasures and win "races" (half way point and end of the trail) which provide further scoring based on how far you are from the leader.  However, each time you move further you're making it easier for your opponent because they can jump ahead of your camel, with the right card combination, without having to pay the price for the space your camel stands on.  It's all about staying close to the caravan, being patient and having impeccable timing.

A játékosok egy-egy tevekaravánt vezetnek a sivatagon keresztül mezőről-mezőre. Az előrehaladás kártyák kijátszásával történik: mindig karavánvezető- és/vagy árukártyák valamilyen kombinációját kell beadnunk.

A fun lighter game that focuses on collecting cards that allow you to move forward on the board.  Each space that you can possibly move on requires a different set of cards, and you skip over spaces occupied by other players, so deciding what to collect is a challenge.  Definitely lighter fare, but well worth playing when you're not in the mood for something meaty.

RATING: 6.7
Questionable replay value, but really a superb Rummy-style board game in which players' set collection requirements shift as much as the sands of the Gobi. Feels very similar to Ticket to Ride, although it's much more passive aggressive than that game, since a player's move in front of your camel can quickly render your hand useless. Drawing one card per turn sometimes results in several rounds where all players just draw, giving the feeling at times that the game is decided by luck... These moments should not be spent digging for a single card, however, and should be spent best preparing your hand for turns to come. So simple, yet so much.

RATING: 5
Not a bad game at all, but it just didn't grab me. You collect cards in order to advance your piece with a goal of collecting treasure and being first to finish. It's certainly a competent design and works well, but it's more of a kid's game in my mind. The choices were all pretty obvious, and the excitement was lacking. It's a pretty game, though, and might be very popular with your group if you have younger players and/or gamers that prefer lighter fare.

It's a race game where Candyland meets Elefantenparade. Neither of these provide great pedigree, and surely enough, it's simply an ok game. Pick up cards that give you as many options as possible and hope that players leave you in a position where you can move without pain. You can also think of this as a cycling game where getting dropped off the back of the peloton can be fatal. There can be some nice tension in the end-game.

Only played once but the experience was not good. We played a 5 player game and I got to the first 6 scoring space first with 3 others close behind. We scored and had to wait for the last player to catch up. This took ages and we ran out of cards. When she got into the scoring zone we started on the second phase with me the winner in the first going last as per the rules. By this time every one had loads of cards and could do what they wanted. This spoiled the game for me and I could not recover from this last position. I think when the first scoring happens all players should go straight to the new start zone and begin the second phase right away.

Beautiful game with (unfortunately) more than a couple instances of having to look a little too closely to determine the value/identity of several gaming components.

RATING: 6
Update: well I'm surprised to find I've misunderstood the movement rules after nearly 10 games: you can move as far your hand cards allow. So with the session with 5 there was more hoarding than I'm used to and making it feel like a Ticket to Ride session. Not sure if I'm keen on this 'freedom' though I suspect it will be easy to assess when to 'charge' and leave the others eating your dust with 3 players as tracking weaknesses and strengths of opponent's hands is difficult with more.

Similar to 80 Days in terms of collecting cards necessary for movement which then gives you vp status, but Marco offers more thought in a shorter playing time, as well as a better and realistic narrative. The card requirements for moving in MP are varied, so you draft cards (which have value in colour and symbol) which offer more flexibility of moving to a  vacant space when desired spaces become occupied. There is less fun elements than in 80D and but can be tense, but some players have a heady time with card selecting and anticipating other's moves and frustration follows especially when the right card fails to turn up in the draft (though with less players this would be less of an issue). I like it but finding it hard to find players who think likewise.

Planning out a true strategy is really tough as it difficult to guess what people are going to do in front of you but that is sort of the fun of the game.  I also like the catch up mech which you spend your gold to move faster but only if you are behind.  Great little thinking game that is really easy to learn but gives you interesting decisions through out.

It is definitely a card game not a board game. So if you don’t like card games, avoid this game. The theme is a definitely pasted on; so if you want a rich simulation of caravanning across the desert in the late 1200’s, avoid this game. But if you want a lite, fun family game in which you have to be ready and willing to adjust your strategy for victory as many times as the sands shift, then this game for you. It’s fun and fairly quick. The only problem it the lack of player aid cards to help first time players figure out what the little symbols mean. All in all, a good filler game or one to play with non-gamers

Wait for the best move, don't burn through your cards, try for a break at the right time, wait for the others to come to you at the half way point, evaluate who's threatening you the most and try and hurt them.

Players move caravans across the desert collecting cards and forming sets.  They can also spend victory points to do so, but not to take the lead.

Knizia does TTR, okay it's another of Knizia's set collection games with strong hand management, this time crossed with a race game and with classic doctor's love for risk taking, this time in the form of a game of chicken. Every space costs you cards (specific combinations, ze old euro spreadsheet way - but it's written on the board, so it's instantly grokked) and cards don't grow on trees. So the trick is using other players to jump over them (only one player per space) to conserve cards, unless they moved forward and messed up your brilliant plans. Maybe I have to play this with competitive adults. 

Very accessible, family type game which has enough tension/bluffing to make it interesting, lighter on strategy than TTR (making it better for kids). Probably not something worth seeking out, not bad, but doesn't stand out from the pack.

Érdekes mechanizmusú Knizia játék. Karavánjainkkal ládákat gyűjtünk a Daiduba vezető úton. Különböző színű kártyákat húzunk, amivel olyan helyre léphetünk, ahol még nem áll ellenfelünk tevéje. Közvetlen elé lépésnél csak egy hely, több hellyel való elé lépésnél minden üres hely feltételét teljesíteni kell a kezünkben levő kártyákból. Túl nagy izgalmat nem biztosító játékról van szó, de egy-egy alkalommal jó kikapcsolódást nyújthat a komolyabb játékok között.

Nice change of pace... the pace in this case being slow and careful.  Store up cards in anticipation of being able to use them when the other players occupy spaces in front of you (you get to skip the occupied spaces) but be prepared to extemporize, because you can't be sure which spaces they'll hit!  Interesting waiting game.

Big box, nice tokens and pawns. Not very challenging, rather light gameplay. Well suited to play with casual players or on family gatherings.

Great little game requiring some tactical play, some prediction of other players, and some hand management.

My fellow gamers seemed to enjoy this one more than I did myself.  It wasn't bad at all, but I can't say it was great either.

Decent race game by Knizia. The game can be a little thought-provoking at times, but certainly not a brain-burner. Nice camels.

We have found this to be a fun family game. While it lacks alot of depth, it does provide a good learning game for kids especially in the 7-10 age bracket. Having to figure out what is needed for the next space and how to utilize your cards in hand with the turned up cards. Recommended for short game periods 30-45 mins.  This is not only a kids game though adults will enjoy it as well.

Played once with 5 players. Aborted game half way through. Components look nice, but the mix of symbols and colours is confusing and hard to keep track of. Once you're behind, you stay behind.

I get a feeling of Ticket to Ride. Cards are face up and you can pick them or from a face down draw pile. Draw, Draw, Draw, Draw, Play some cards. You jump over the other people in the caravan to move to the spot at the front. The problem is that you don't know when and where people are going to move. The cards don't come up in a way that you can set yourself up to be able to move to multiple spots on the trail and if you wait for those cards you'll be left behind. Also, some locations are harder to pass than others so everyone just collects cards for many turns. If you're the person to open the gate for the rest of the caravan, then the group runs past using the cards they collected while you collected the group of cards to get over the hump. The reward for you doing this is that the others trigger a scoring round right after you get them over this hump and you're standing on a space that's low scoring.

Nice game with some quite clever ideas, but I fear the replayability is a bit low. You can get really screwed in this one when someone else steals your plan and lefts you with handful unuseful cards.

RATING: 5
Basically a hand management game with a poorly pasted-on theme, including a strong element of memory game and guessing + double-guessing the other players if playing with less than four players.

Not a standout, especially given some of the gems designed by Knizia, but solid, balanced and playable.

RATING: 6
Charming looking game (the board is especially appealing in my opinion), but with quite unimaginative gameplay. Although the game is very easy to teach and play, I find that even non-gamers find it rather unexciting. Not bad, but simply unimpressive (been there, done that).

Played a long time ago and likely didn't explore all the nuances Knizia had to offer. Would love to try it again.

This game reminds me of Cartagena.  Instead of having multiple pawns, and just playing a single card to move forward, you have a single pawn, and you move forward by playing sets of cards to match the requirements of the target space.  There are some other interesting mechanics that allow you to buy your way forward, and there are bonus chests to get for getting to a space first or being at the right place at the right time.  It is a good game, and I enjoyed it, but when everything is said and done, I would probably play the more elegant Cartagena instead.  Based on one play.

Fun family game.  Not sold on the card colors/clarity of icons, but my kids liked it.  Not exactly a huge endorsement there, though; there are lots of games they like more.

At the beginning of our boardgame addiction, we bought this as one of our first buys. Easy but entertaining. For old time sake I don't mind this hitting the table.

A good gateway game.  You think you have just managed to get the right card then wham bam it is all change and you need to try again. Hand management, looking ahead, hedging your bets all part of this excellent game. The chests with bands are a neat currency.

Played a few times (with 4 or 5 players). The main drawback of this game is his lack of innovative ideas. It works fairly well, but I cannot remember anything in it which has not been seen already before.

RATING: 7.5
Not a huge amount of strategy but some, and lots of cases where you can accidentally (or on purpose) cause trouble for an opponent by moving forward when they aren't expecting you to. You need to plan which cards you will need and draw them, but you can make as many moves as you want (and have cards for) in a turn so sometimes a player will jump when you don't expect and suddenly you have the wrong cards.

Works nicely as a family game, although it can be brutal because if you get too far behind the caravan you will end up just wandering in the desert for the whole game and lose miserably.

RATING: 6
My one play was enjoyable.  This is very much a game about timing.  Most players can usually make a move, and have ~equal resources, so the timing is everything.

RATING: 2.5
An odd duck. Theoretically a hand management game, but the pace was strange. Irregular surges of activity followed by incredibly long pauses of inactivity. More strategy may reveal itself as time goes on, but hording cards, and taking advantage of the first player to "blink" and act (and thus open up an opportunity for rapid advancement by subsequent players) appears problematic. Further play simply shows that the game is erratic, clumsy and perhaps even broken, as card hording can reach extremes where there are no more cards to draw and no one has the required cards to advance, leading to complete lockdown.

Чертовски хороши игры, в которых продумывать свои действия нужно не на ход, а на 2-3 вперед. А эти верблюдики! Из чего они, кстати, сделаны?

A light, easy game that takes a small amount of time to play and set-up.

Quite a few games have stolen some of Dr. Knizia's ideas from this rarish game.

RATING: 7
Европейская игра от Книция. Хорошо сбалансирована и продумана. Счёт идёт на единицы очков, но в отличие от обычных семеек, эти единицы выбиваются в сложных многоходовых операциях. Игроки двигают свои караваны по линии препятствий, где нужно скидывать карты с нарисованными предметами, или ожидать, пока нужные карты придут. Карты берём с открытого базара, стараясь заранее набрать на сколько-то ходов вперёд, рассчитывая на ходы соперников и пытаясь не упустить момент, когда накопленное играется. 

Минусы - отрыв не слишком большой, есть фактор случая, игра сама по себе 60-и минутный процесс с элементами соревнования, дополнительного фана кроме соревновательного почти не несёт.

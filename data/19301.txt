enjoyable, nice bits. good look and feel. another player mentioned it felt like Tikal-light and i thought that was a good analogy, but i'd rather just play Tikal. Seems like there needs to be a better ending condition as the other 3 players were ready to finish the round after the first player did.

My first play was an enjoyable two player experience. We used the expansions cards, which I thought were fun. You basically have to build up your machine to successfully deliver larger and larger point tokens to the temple. The tile placement offers some interesting options, and the card play provides some fun chaos. Ultimately it is a fast game, and should be played as such. I would try with three, but I think four players would be too much, and would turn it into too long of a game for what it is.

I like it much more than Carcassonne!

Wrede just doesn't seem to be the designer for me. The game works, but there is hardly any excitement. The game is all about optimising your actions; most of your actions will revolve about getting groups of two meeples at a certain location at the end of your move. This strongly restricts your options. The cards are not strong enough to offer any options otherwise, so you only take those if you have no other choice (which usually means you did not optimise correctly). That some cards are much stronger than others doesn't help.

RATING: 4
good production, simple rules.  the idea sounded great, but the rules made it seem like a pretty basic action point pick up and deliver game.  it played like that too, at least with 2 players.  i do enjoy the pacing, but can't see how this could stand up to very much replay because so much of it relies on basic optimization.  even though it's light and easy, i feel like i could blow away a new player.  i think the aha gap is huge between the first and second play, but i don't see how it would get terribly deeper from there.  because of the quick turns and resolution i would be unexcited but also not bothered to play it again.  and perhaps more players would put variables in the equation via theft and church-sitting, which didn't seem like particularly great ideas with only two.  maybe a more-used board would present more tactical opportunities.  at the end of the day, it's tikal light for me, but too light.

RATING: 7
This game felt like a fusion of Settlers of Catan, Blue Moon City, and Carcassonne - at least, elements of each stuck out in my mind.  Not that that's a bad thing - the game was quite enjoyable.  As the board gets bigger, there seems to be more choices and the game slows down.  My one play took MUCH longer than 45 minutes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a nice filler game that tends to run a bit long for a filler.  The game doesn't have the depth of strategy to explore nor the feeling of possible options that Carcassonne does and this detracts from the game overall.  Howeverm in its own right, the game is tight, very balanced and feel quite complete.  The games are always close - so much so that it is easy to wonder if you are winning by dumb luck.  This is not likely the case as it is possible to tarce a win to a few key decisions (and some luck of the tile draws).  A good game to mix up the standard play list without feeling let down.

Yes, the box insert is awful. I managed to get a huge lead by early grabbing of stones, but this wouldn't happen once people have more experience. Offers lots of choices (but not too many).

an absolutely abstract game, which has nothig to do with Mesopotamië. the temple could be inka also... (perheps egyptian too). the volcanos are absolutely absurd. perhaps water could serve the same goal. simple ruels, quick gamesequence, once you got the line. no new ideas, but it is not bad.
ther are no player aids, which is disappointing. the system of fitting tiles together is genial. why never used earlier?

Very interseting game, with a slight flavor of Tikal in it. Plays faster, and there is more of a feeling of progression during the game. Very enjoyable.

Upon further play, it seems that the game is in control, and everyone hits the "about to win" stage at exactly the same time, no matter what.

I like games with expanding boards. While the path to victory is the same in each game, that path winds in different directions due to the way the tiles come out and how cards are used by your opponents. I like the five movement points to use instead of ten actions in games like Tikal. It's a fun exploration, pick up and deliver game with a little "take that" on the side.

Hexagonal carcassonne pick up & deliver race game. That just about sums it up!

RATING: 4
We quickly discovered that there are very few differing strategies in this game and that the resource limits almost force a single strategy.  You have 4 huts (after 1 starter) and you have 4 mana to bring into play, so you need to build 4 huts, no more, no less.  You must get your mana to 7 to win the game, so you must deliver at least 3 stones to the temple and you'll want to make at least one holy place to regain mana, so that about uses up all the stones you'll get.  Oh, and you need enough tribes to move this stuff around.  The game quickly becomes simply a race to see who can accomplish these predefined tasks first and in mostly the same order.

Considering this was being hyped as a shorter more mainstream civ-building type game, I was very underwhelmed and probably won't play it again.

RATING: 7
Mesopotamia is a game that surprises with its excellent components, including stones that are made of actual stone, visually appealing interlocking modular board,  and  well laid out and colorful overview and rules booklets. While not overly deep, Mesopotamia is a nice little gem that is deeper than rankings suggest.  There is only one way to win: be the first to provide four offerings to the god Marduk by delivering them to the cool looking temple that is placed in the middle of the board at the start of the game. While there is but a single way to win, there are multiple paths to victory and plenty of opportunities for tactical maneuvering. There is randomness in this game but there are sufficient ways to mitigate it so that luck can be reduced to a moderate role in determining who ultimately wins. There are some opportunities for direct conflict and to screw the other players; mostly brought about by some of the cards. Otherwise, player interaction is pretty modest. The box indicates a play time of 45 minutes but our 3-4 player games are closer to 1 hour.  Mesopotamia is the type of game that I will suggest and likely never turn down. Makes for a great light-medium strategy and family game.

Very nice components, you even get real rocks (although they are a bit chalky). It's also easy to learn and there is some strategy involved. On the downside the path to victory is fixed, there are no alternative win conditions with could make it more interesting. Therefore the replay value is very low. It's a pity because the game flows quickly and a game can be clocked under an hour.

Me gustó bastante la partida la primera vez que jugué a este juego. Es una especie de carrera, a ver quien entrega antes cuatro ofrendas en un templo, pero para hacerlo, debes conseguir maná y tener trabajadores.. para lo que necesitaras construir casetas y lugares sagrados que te costarán madera y piedras.

Las reglas son muy sencillas... y hay bastante interacción entre jugadores (puedes usar sus templos, puedes robarles mercancías, etc). 

Recomendable. Tengo ganas de probarlo a 4 jugadores (es de 2 a 4 y lo he probado, hasta la fecha solo con 2).

A fun game with a cool premise - sacrificing your people and posessions to the gods! I really like the exploration and empire building aspects, and the way you can set up your strategy around the cards you draw.  The game is turn based, but the turns really fly by.  It is fast fun and furious.  I'd recommend it to any gamer, long before I'd recommend Herr Jurgen-Wrede's best-selling game Carcassone.Try it, you won't be dissapointed.

Interesting exploration and development game (neat interlocking hex tiles) where you are carrying around wood, stone, or your "offering" (first rid of all 4, wins) on your "head"; try to pair up in the clear to build a hut (or manna farm) or in a hut to reproduce.Pierce had neat variant to use 3 blank tiles as "wormholes". Can increase 5 move limit by discarding cards.

Among resource management games, Mesopotamia hits a pretty sweet balance for me in terms of the number of things going on at any one time, the amount of control I have over my own destiny and player interaction. But the theme of building up mana (a polynesian term that feels out of place if this game is set in Mesopotamia) in order to deliver sacrifices to Marduk is a bit off-putting. A slightly better thematic fit might have been the south Pacific, with sacrifices to the denizens of Mu.

Although it's nothing spectacular, it's a solid game.  Has some pick up and deliver action, which I like, and the mana to deliver your offerings is interesting and different.  The problem is its replayability.  The path to victory is always the same, making the game very repetitive with repeat plays.  I'm not sure I'd want to play it again for a very long time for that reason.

Mesopotamia strikes me as a cross between a pure race game and Roads & Boats. The basic idea is that everyone needs to sacrifice 4 guys to the temple in the centre of the board, but first they have to generate mana which requires temples which require stone to build. Of course, having more guys is good, so you will also need some huts so your folks can generate offspring...fresh for the sacrifice.The overall speed and tone of the game is excellent on this. Every turn there are quite a few tempting things to do and not quite enough time to do them all. Rocks seem to go very quickly, because of their dual use (can immediately tithe them to receive extra mana and to up your maximum, or can use them later to build a temple which generates mana over the long term. The whole key to the game seems to boil down to two things: 

1) Using the back half of the turn effectively: as at that point you can do one special action, like build huts or temples, but if you have multiple huts or temples ready to be built you can do it all at once. Managing those special actions so that you could get double actions out of them reliably seemed to be the key to winning the game, because otherwise the scores are very, very tight throughout. 

2) Drawing the right tiles at the right time. This is particularly true in the early game for rock pits because rocks are dual use and absolutely critical. If you draw one early you can generally protect it and get at least 5 or 6 rocks out of it, which is all that you will need for the entire game. If you are unlucky here, and the other players get all of the pits, you will need to waste a lot of valuable time trekking across the board, trying to steal them, and because of the time loss, in turn lose the game.

I think my biggest beef with this game, and the reason it gets a 4 instead of something higher is that there isn't much variability built into the system, and I really don't feel that there is anything new to see here anymore. Heck, I knocked Roads & Boats for replayability, and it has many, many layers of extra stuff added to the Mesopotamia base (i.e.: in Meso you need to have guys with a certain resource to build a building, and that is it. In Roads you need to have guys with a certain resource to build a building. Then, that building makes yet another resource which you can use to build yet another new building, which can probably create yet another new building...you get the idea). There is also quite a bit of luck involved in the game as well, primarily through tile drawing, but also through the card deck, which I have the feeling can end up determining the winner because otherwise the game is so very tight due to the "on a rail" aspect.

I was not too impressed by this game. The box and pieces are great the game is easy to teach and plays fairly quickly. However there isn't much player interaction and it really boils down to solving the puzzle of how to most efficiently deliver all your items to the temple. The board does come out randomly except the initial starting tiles and the cards add some randomness so this provides for a good number of repeat plays. That is if you like that kind of game. Traded this one.

Fun little pick up and deliver game with exploration elements. The player interaction is rather light, which is both good and bad. It plays pretty quickly which is a plus.

Beautiful production, nice idea, but the quirks and problems caused me to raise my eyebrows more and more until I had to tape them to my face lest they leave it. Every game I have played so far has ended in a win for one player with the other one or two turns behind. The reason is obvious: there is a rather fixed amount of steps you need to take in order to deliver the fourth offering to the temple, and it being a game of efficiency, any action which does not help you to reach that goal puts you at a disadvantage. If you hinder one player, you are merely allowing another player to catch up, or even pass you on your unguarded side. So you only hinder when you are able to strengthen your own position, which happens almost never.

Since the game is a snowball race game, I also get the feeling that there are far too many silly rules going into the design. You need wood for this, stone for that, there are weird blocking rules, mana can be obtained in several ways, and so forth. Wrede obviously wanted to create such a title, but I'm not sure that the core idea is a good one, not when everyone shares the same goal and the same limitations. I don't think including different goals would have weighed down on the current ruleset all that much. There has been extensive discussion about various rules variants, but I found none of them to my liking as they do not change what I perceive to be the core issues of this title: they are meant to increase player interaction, but they do not really increase the [i]incentive[/i] to do so, nor do they introduce different ways to obtain one's goal.

I think it's a crying shame that so much effort went into the physical design of Mesopotamia. You [i]want[/i] the game to work: how can it be otherwise given the smart interlocking tiles and bright, clear artwork? But alas, this title appears to be yet another miss from the early Phalanx days. I [i]really[/i] wish my sweetheart would wise up about the game, forget her love for the design, and let me sell off this PoS—the threat of major bodily harm is the only thing which keeps this title in our collection at the moment.

[b]Update[/b] Eventually sold off—eventually even the sweetheart had to concede that there really wasn't much point to this game.

This seems to be a simple pick-up-and-deliver game, but you quickly realize it's a bit more complicated than that.  The various aspects of what you need require a balance of resources so careful planning is called for.

In a way I think this is more of an abstract puzzle than a typical game, and I appreciate that it burns your brain a bit.  The 2-player game is heavier on strategy, but with more players you'll be scrambling for resources and need to steal them.

The components are excellent, and the rules are laid out nicely.  The included "game overview" was a great idea.  An enjoyable and fast game, I'm happy to play it again.

Production: The interlocking tiles are really neat, maintaining the integrity of the board.  All the pieces are well made (though the tribes aren't quite broad enough to easily balance resources on them).  I don't care for the artwork on the tiles; feels a bit computery.

Play: I'm not too thrilled about this one.  The goals tightly constrain what players must do to achieve those goals, and achieving those goals is hard work, even without interruption from the other players.  One must forage to find wood, to build huts, to create offerings, and also forage to find stone, to increase mana, so that one can donate the offerings.  It's rather exhausting, and most choices seem straight-forward.  It's not so much a production engine as just a multi-step process that must be completed in order.  Stones are always sparse, and I used my action to draw cards more than half the time, because there was nothing else I could do. (2+0+1) (1 play)

Played two games, one with my wife and one with my son, both games were quite fun. This game is easy to learn and teach. The pieces look very nice (both tiles and the resources, actual little stones(!) and the game plays pretty fast, so you could even play another (or a different) game. Don't around to play this at the moment, so will probably trade this away.

Mesopotamia is an excellent pick-up-and-deliver game; simple to learn and to teach. Players move their tribes between hex-like tiles on a play area that expands as players choose to explore. Two resource types are gathered, Wood and Stone, from Forest and Quarry tiles, respectively. Wood is used to buy Huts which can be used to increase size of the tribe and to produce offerings to the Gods (more on this later). Stone is used to build Holy Places, which provide Mana at the end of each turn, assuming a tribe member is still present. Stone can also be delivered directly to the central Temple, which increases the players Mana Maximum and the current Mana Value. Huts and Holy Places must be built on Plains hexes. Volcano hexes are also available, which serve as impassable terrain. 

The goal of the game is to deliver Offerings to the Gods in the central Temple hex. A tribe member must pick up the offering from a hut, carry it to the Temple, and give up an amount of Mana equal to the marking on the offering marker. The first person to deliver all four offerings wins the game.

This game plays fast and the simplicity of the design allows players to focus all of their attention on strategy. The production value is high, as with most Phalanx games, and even includes actual stones as resources. If you've been avoiding Phalanx because you think their games may be too "wargamey", just buy this game. It's packed with Euro-goodness.

Like Amun-Re, this game has some interesting ideas that are totally ruined by random powerup cards of radically different usefulness.  Make a careful plan, mug some people, get mugged, develop and explore, it's all pretty good.  But then your opponent plays a card that teleports a piece with what he's carrying anywhere on the board.  You look at your own cards and have a +1 mana and a draw-four-pick-one for tile exploration.

RATING: 6
Good game, but nothing earth-shattering about it.  Check out rule clarifications here on BGG before playing. It's not a very well translated rule book.  I think this may be a solid 6.  Our first play took several hours to play.  It could probably go up to a 7 if repeated plays brought down playing time to advertised "45mins".
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Players move a tribe of Mesopotamians around an ever growing playing area, building huts and altars, breeding, and gaining mana.  Mana is cashed in for making offerings at the central temple.  Mechanics are reminiscent of Tikal, with action points being spent to move around the board - along with terrain tiles being flipped up to grow the map.  Very easy game to grasp and play, and certainly nothing wrong with it, just nothing to make it stand out from the crowd.

What a cool game, with some very cool bits!  At it's core, this is a fairly transparent abstract game, but the smoke and mirrors of the theme and tactile bits helps to make it a more interesting experience.  This is exactly the kind of game I've been waiting for, a simple, small scale, population growth/building game.  My only complaint is that there doesn't seem to be enough player interaction - but I need to play it some more.

RATING: 7
As one would suspect from any game by Wrede this is a good game with solid and unfussy rules. The game material is, again as one would expect from Phalanx, really beautiful, and the rules are clearly laid out. If you like this game will depend on whether you like "efficiency maximation" and "logistics" games or not. Every action point counts here, and the endgame is usually a close race between players, that is - if all play competently - also heavily influenced by the draw of cards and tiles. As in "Carcassonne" this is basically an abstract game, but the theme fits ok, and it is also very family compatible. With gamers it can become a little of a silent think fest, as interaction is relatively limited.

This game surprised me, in a generally positive way.  Not expecting much when a friend brought it over, it turned out to be a fun and relatively short game that reminded me somewhat of Catan and Carcassonne in terms of presentation and gameplay.  While much more could have been done with the very promising Mesopotamia theme, the resource gathering and building gameplay is fast, competitive, and enjoyable.

Here's a great example of the less is more school of thought.

Sort of like Settlers (well I guess just the hex board), but with fewer resources.  This is a fast resource/building/use-your-action-points game.  The race for the end is always hysterical -- a lot of times the special ability cards have made all the difference.  The use of little pebbles for stone resources is WONDERFUL!  This game's bits always make me smile.  And the interlocking hexes are PHENOMENAL.  No more wrecking the game when the table gets bonked.

Mesopotamia is a game of pick-up and delivery. Works well mechanically, and looks great as well.

Two things keep me from giving it a better score, though. The action cards are not balanced. Some of them are very useful, others not so much, and my feeling is that all things considered they have too much of an impact on the game. The other point might be more of a rules oversight, but it is quite possible for one or more players to get locked out of winning the game by a shortage in stones. Fortunately, this situation can be houserules easily but it seems like a glaring omission.

Now that I have had the chance to get a few plays of this Wrede title in I can claim that I really like Mesopotamia (and Wrede's new fascination with sacrifice).  I find Mesopotamia a pure exploration/ pick-up and deliver/race game; if there is such a thing.  I agree by description this game should be a mess, yet it plays suprisingly, and enjoyably smooth.  The game offers up a strong option to hinder your opponents while increasing your standing, so never feels like a solitaire exercise ( like some p/d games I have played), nor does it isolate the players ability to effect their opponent's game so that it feels purely a race game.  For a light weight offering with real decisions, Mesopotamia is a strong contender in it's weight class for table time.  My rating of a seven however is tentative in relation to whether or not my interest with this title will remain or if it will fade - as I do wonder if there is something in the aesthetic or theme that is blinding me to any real flaws.
As aforementioned though, with this title and Pompeji Wrede is certainly pioneering an interesting thematic canon leant on sacrifice. By developing lighter games with dark themes Wrede is creating an interesting avenue of  gateway titles for different sensibilities and humor.  I applaud the risk.

This is only a "8" when played with my favorite variants.  Mesopotamia is one of the most played games in my collection, and I'll still play it anytime with anyone.

I really like this one... A pick up and deliver race with outstanding bits, simple rules and a relatively short playing time.  Just enough going on to be engaging but not brain-burning. Works well with any number of players 2-4.  This game is vastly improved by two simple changes: 

1) remove one of each type of cards from the deck and do not recycle cards back into the deck... when they are gone, they are gone.  

2) require a tribe to spend 1 movement point to pick up an offering.

If you have the expansion (all the expansion does is add a few more cards of a few new different types to the deck) then remove ALL BUT ONE OF EACH TYPE from the deck before you start play and follow the same "no recycle" rule. This makes each card much more dear and special... 

Two more variants that add spice rather than fixing a problem:

1) use the extra 3 (blank) hex tiles as "wormholes" to teleport your tribes from any one of these tiles to any of the other "wormhole" tiles and 

2) allow players to steal resources from each other at any time (by deducting 1 AP from their next turn)... not just during their own turn.

Played a 3 player game.  Quite a lot of ways to mess with opponents.  I'm a little worried the game will play the same way each time, varying only because of the drawing of new land tiles.  I know that's a big thing in itself, but it feels like you know who's going to win about half way through the game.  I hope I'm wrong with future plays.

This is a really good and fun pick up and deliver/exploration game. It has some wonderful bits and looks great. The game can be played with 2-4 players, but I feel it is best with four. The game is very easy to learn and suprisingly not a brain burner at all. The game plays fairly quick and there's not much downtime between players. The action point system works really well and flows well with the game. I've had this on my watch list for a long time now and am glad that I finally got to play it. I have put my order in for a copy and can't wait to play some more. If you like pick up and deliver/exploration games. Then you may wanna take a look at this one. It is well worth it.

Rating after three games. The first game was rather slow but intriguing enough to make us play again. Once we had worked out the production cycle the game moved much faster. By the third game we were finishing very close, often with everyone capable of finishing on the same turn. When played like this there is quite a degree of tension, trying to remember what tokens other players have dropped off and whether you should push to win or try to confound other players. This makes the cards important, since often they are the only thing that can disrupt an opponent and can also give you a surprise finish. Good game then, and very pretty.

I appreciate any game that comes with actual rocks, so this game has that going for it.  Mesopotamia isn't a bad game at all, but I can see it getting old quickly.  The expansion I would definitely add in right off the bat to add a little more variety to the game.  It just seems like there are so many better games out there than this for this type of game.  I like it when tried and true mechanics are used to bring out a good game, but it is just not happening here.  Give me Tikal, Mexica, or Java.

RATING: 5
My first pick-up-and-deliver game, and although I like its easy to grasp play, and aesthetically its very nice, the path to victory is too narrow for it have any depth.

There is a fixed number of offerings you must deliver, with a fixed total mana cost, and only one way to increase your mana-limit. So there is only one path to winning the game, and it largely is dependant on who wastes more movements collecting resources, which is otherwise only affected by the random appearance of resource tiles.

One play.  Amusing light logistics game that may remind players of Tikal, Lost Valley or maybe an extremely simplified Roads & Boats.  My first game was great, but it looks like the game would get repetitive quickly since your goals and starting positions are exactly the same every game.  It does look like there are multiple approaches to winning, though, so maybe I'm wrong.  I'm also a bit concerned about the effect of the special action cards on the later stages of the game - great potential for screwy kingmaker stuff based on the luck of the draw.  Another concern is that the game ends in anticlimax, with no surprises and everyone standing around watching their final few mana drip into their pot.  Finally, I worry that the random location of the crucial stone fields will decide many contests.  I expect my rating to drop if I have the opportunity to play Mesopotamia a couple more times.  I'd rate my first game as a 7 or an 8, but my long-term projection is more like a 6.

I’m enjoying Mesopotamia.  It is the type of game that I usually enjoy tremendously, as it offers a wide variety of options and doesn’t tie players to a pre-defined, linear path when pursuing their objectives.  While the goal for each player is identical, there appear to be various ways in which to achieve those goals.  The game feels much like Spiel des Jahre and International Gamers Award winner Tikal, which challenges players to optimize the use of their limited action points.  In that regards, Mesopotamia is certainly in fine company.

It works well and is a pleasure to play, but the fact that I had a few very close games with not-so-good players (even losing to them) is a little detracting. I like the interlocking tiles, which allow the board to be easily moved, if it expands too much in one direction.

A pretty average euro game that is basically just a pick up and deliver game.  There is some more meat to it, as you can build various upgrades for your city that change just how you can pick up and deliver (get more "mana," breed more workers, draw special action cards, etc.) but in the end it is an efficiency pick up and deliver game with a tile laying component.  The bits are excellent but typical euro-style wooden pieces, except for the stone, which are little polished marble bits in the shape of gravel.  Not a bad game but it lacks any inspiration either from theme or strategy that makes me want to play it again.

"4 - Not so good, it doesn't get me but could be talked into it on occasion." - pretty correct that is.
It looks nice, it works -- it doesn't excite me.

As others already said: you can either make an effective move, or not - that is the main decision in your turn.
In our game, we acted on instinct - the game was close (all would have been able to finish in the same round -- not sure whether this is a good sign here).
Anyhow - as it is so much about optimising, I miss the 'gamey' (i.e. fun) part therein.

I think that this game and Kreta compete for good '05 games that don't really break new ground.  However, I enjoyed Kreta more.  This is a beautiful game though.  Bound to get oohs and aaaahhhs when on a table.

Exploration:Action points:Building
P/U & Del

Initial rating one play 

I'm not sure I see any Catan here like some others, very very little, more related to Tikal with some important differences and a big one being 5 action points instead of 10. Probably this alone ensured the game play is faster with 3 or 4 people where Tikal bogs down somewhat at those numbers. A little less interaction (fighting for position) here but some and some over resources as well and there are lots of things to do with your 5 AP's. Exploration in this is quite similiar and then most of the similarities stop there. Resources used for building are fought over and come into play, special power cards can be chosen and a p/u & del aspect is in this as well all combining for some great strategic game play. The only quibble I have is it can be hard to stop the leader. If this would of had even more interaction/confrontation or a couple more "take that" cards it would of been even better, as is still a fun game. If you like Tikal or Java but don't like playing with 4 people due to AP and downtime, here is a great solution along with Mexica of course which I prefer to this.

Bokkensprong 17/05/2013 met Claudia, Pascal en Joeri. Spelbord uitbouwen en om het eerst met je pionnetjes 4 offers brengen in de centrale tempel. Je kan boomstammen of stenen meedragen om hutten te bouwen of offerplaatsen te creëren op vrije plaatsen op het spelbord. Wel leuk, maar iedereen speelt zijn eigen spel zonder al te veel interactie met de anderen.

21/09/2014 gekocht (EUR 9) op tweedehandsbeurs bij bordspelkampioenschap Winning Movez in Lokeren (zelf niet deelgenomen).

I really enjoyed the game, it's simple in a Settlers sort of way.  This definitely falls in the medium weight range of games though it has the look of something heavier, which along with the Phalanx name you would think it is. Speaking of looks, the games looks fantastic and the bits are excellent.

There is a nice balance between the randomness of the tile draw and strategically executing your limited actions and movements. The game plays quickly. But there really isn't enough to the game to make it stand out from the crowd. I suspect the game would take on a sameyness after a few plays.

RATING: 6.5
1 play. Interesting system but with play that is a little too laid back. As one other commenter noted, it is mostly about deciding the order you want to do things.  But once you've set that strategy, I think you just play it out.  The game lacks tension - to be the first or have the most.  I would have liked to see how the game played if for example the earlier you bring an offering, the less mana it cost (a little like Doge).

An enjoyable little game, it almost scratches the itch for Roads and Boats, which I can't help thinking of when my "tribes" are carrying goods and multiplying when left alone in certain circumstances, like R&B's geese and donkeys.  As long as the game plays quickly I think it's pretty fun.  There is a lot of luck with the tile draws, as some players can be nearly cut off from the flow of resources.  Also it seems very difficult to slow down the leader - the aggressive cards still aren't very aggressive.  I'm not sure that more "take that" action is what the game needs, but I guess as long as you play it as a light game, your needs will be met.

Pick-up-and-deliver combined with something in the direction of area control. Quite unique, I think. It's heavy on the movement optimization as you want to always have either a build or breed action to do at the end of your turn and getting the chance to do either of those requires optimal moving and preferably also some luck on the exploring.

Nice little pick-up-and-deliver game. Initial impression is that the end game often will come down to "who got the right tile when exploring" among competent players. I.e. who "wasted" less moves exploring. Will want to explore this one some more before the final verdict, though.

Very fine components, the stones are a nice touch.

Feels like Wrede could have developed it some more, though. Also, has the game been rethemed from i.e. Aztecs or some such? Volcanoes & "sacrifice" of the delivering party?

Who can resist moving around little figures with rocks and wood on their heads?  Obviously neither my wife nor I can.  For some reason, that one little aspect and the cool tiles really add to the game's fun factor.  Throw in the action point system along with exploration, and you've got one great title!

Played twice, 3p and 4p.  I thought this game was pretty fun, but had a mechanic that I don't care too much for.  That is, it really matters what tiles you draw when you explore (add to the board); if you don't get what you need, not only have you wasted your turn, but you can't do anything at all.  The winners of our games benefited from this more than once.  I liked the interlocking tiles, and the playing pieces, though.

Beautiful looking game but pretty empty inside.  About halfway through my first play I was already bored.  Granted it was only a two player game, but I cannot see it being much better with 3 or 4.

Mexopotamia: Nice game. On the last turn or 2 you can tell who will (likely) win, but this 'problem' is true of many games. Still, it is fun getting there.

Chancy due to tile drawing, but the exploration bit is fun even though it can be annoying. Scales well with any number, but probably best with more.

Mexopotamia: Obviously was supposed to be South American themed.

Nothing in here that wowed me. It was a nice pick up and deliver game, but not the best I've played. The game has very nice production values (all the way down to using real rocks for the stone). 

Update: More plays...more strategy. It's all in how the tiles come out. Strategy can vary wildly in this game, and playing it more was what the doctor ordered.

Update:

Played again and had 3 players who could not win based on how the tiles came out so the game virtually locked up for 3 of us. 

It will get another play to see if it can save itself from the trade pile.

Played it in Essen. This game is a nice, light exploration/movement game which can be played in 30-45 minutes. But it really looks like the starting player will win the game just before the other players will finish in the same round, if no one made a mistake or a player decided to be a kingmaker by stealing a mana from the starting player just before he finishes...

This needs verification by a few more plays, but the game seems to have a problem here.

I really quite like this game.  It's simple enough to be a gateway game but one that play satisfyingly enough for more experienced gamers.  One thing that dominated all our games is the power of the Teleport card - it seemd to always determine the winner of the game and so I wonder if it's overpowered...  The game is a race for resources but the random draw of tiles means the strategies have to be adapted each game.

Also, I feel the game could benefit from some house rules such as only one tribe can be on a monument at any given time, or that with enough tribes vs another, tribes can be ejected from tiles.  This would add a conflict dynamic that could add another level of strategy.

2 / 5 - Fair.

This feels a lot like a bunch of other games cobbled together: Attika and Tikal for were inspirations for this amongst others, I'm sure. As is often the way it fails to live up to its source material. At first glance it offers plenty of choice, open strategy and it has some nice bits including real pebbles for the stone resource. But I'm suspicious of how much the strategy you choose really means in the long run: it seems engineered to result in close finishes no matter what you do.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Make sure you play with the correct stone rules. There is a misprint in the English translation. Stones are never removed from the game. You always restock the supply.

My group has found the game play tense and all of us felt like we were in the hunt the entire time.  Great play for us.

--- time passes...dust gathers...no table time

I dusted this off and my wife and I played last night. She'd never played before but we were up and rolling in about 30 minutes and it took us only about an hour to play.  I was surprised at how much I'd remembered about the game even though I'd only played once or twice before. Easy to learn, easy to teach.  There are a couple of fiddly things to remember like: did I remove the tribesman from the board after I delivered a token, did I move my mana limit and mana token after delivering a stone to the temple, did I take my mana at the end of the turn, etc. but that's nit picking.  Good game, relatively close race, games may be highly interactive or relatively solitary endeavors...it just depends.

03/20/10 Played a three-player game. Very nice components. Like Tikal, it can induce analysis paralysis, as you really do need to optimize every single move you make. Not only do you need to do the most possible with your dudes this turn, you must think ahead to the next turn. Are you leaving them at the end of this turn in a location where they'll be of most use next turn? This gives the game a "solve the puzzle" feel. Warning the balancing of offering chits, timbers, and stones on top of the tribesmen is not for the shaky of hand.

One of my gaming buddies bought this quite a while ago, but we haven't played it yet (I'm usually the one who figures out the rules to games). It looks so pretty, and I could got it for cheap, so I bought one to figure out so we'll finally play this...

Turns out it's actually a nice Eurogame. Nothing really special, but enough interaction, gamelength is just right, plenty of possibilities. Good enough to enjoy and want to play again. Meanwhile the tiles and gameparts are definitely great to look at as well.

Update feb 14: after playing it again it was more fun than expected. Nice euro.

NL: Erg mooi uitgevoerd bordspel. Voor de spelletjesfreak niet super bijzonder, maar gewoon een prima spel, niet te lang, niet te kort, spannend, en genoeg mogelijkheden om te twijfelen hoe je het beste jezelf vooruit helpt en je tegenstanders dwarszit.

Nice exploration/development/pick-up-and-deliver game. The actions cards are a bit more variable in power level than I'd like ideally (ie, some are very good, some are quite poor) but it's still nice. The exploration element here is very light, but I like it. Plays reasonably quickly too.

For a resource management game of this length it's just right.  The player interaction seemed light which was both good and bad--good in the sense that it made the game lighter and more relaxing, bad in the sense that it has less tactical/strategic depth than games I ususally prefer.  Overall, a winner.  A nice closer.  It may lack enough depth to become a personal classic.

Move tribesman to collect stones or timber. Build huts to bring in offerings, or shrines to gain mana. Throw in four offerings before anyone else to win the game. A game from the designer of Carcassone, this game is another game from the family of Tikal, Goldland, Pangea, etc, where you move, wait for your opponents to move, then move, etc. It's not bad. If you are winning, it's fun, if you are behind and waiting for people to move, it's not that fun. This type of game isn't really my game, but if you like Tikal, Goldland, etc, you will enjoy this one.

A nice pickup and deliver type game. Very Tikal-ish, but lighter. My only complain is that your strategy is heavily restricted by the fact that you have to help building the temple in the early stage of the game, in order to increase your mana limit.

First impression (3 players): Game uses action point mechanic + at the end you can do one "special" action (build houses, build shrines, reproduce or take cards). You're optimizing you're moves and trying to accomplish the goal (sacrifice 4 items to gods) as fast as possible. Meaning you don't want to waste any actions while doing this. You can plan your moves well as the only random elements of the game are land tiles (but only when placing) and action cards (some of them have similar effects but stronger/weaker depending on the cards) other players possess. Overall the action cards aren't that powerful and don't influence game too much. I liked the game. It didn't overly impress but it surely is a good game and a nice short optimization game.

(12/06/06) Het was al weer een tijdje dat ik het spel nog speelde, maar de eenvoudige spelregels maken van dit spel zijn grote troef.  Niet echt moeilijk: 5 stappen en daarna kiezen uit 1 actie en tenslotte Mana verzamelen.  Mana heb je nodig om te offeren, het uiteindelijke doel van het spel.  (speelden mee: Danny, Franky, Frederik en ikzelf)

Played it once - some rules ambiguities. Nice components but the jury is out on the actual game. After playing it once I had no desire to play it again. Nothing dreadful about it, there's just nothing interesting enough to draw me back, and there's so many games I'd rather play in its place.

Bought 2009? from Germany. Sold 2010?

It's an efficiency race game. You've got enough movement points to do something interesting each turn, but making everything come together at the right time is the trick - enough mana just as you give an offering, not letting mana drip away without offerings to soak it up, building the right things at the right time, etc. I think it's decent and interesting without setting the world on fire.

Good Pick-Up-and-Deliver, Exploration Game. Race to build up your tribe in order to make your 4 offerings before anyone else. Good Components. Really good feel to the game.

The thematic sacrifice part of the game might offend some people.

I played and bought this game at Essen fair 2005! I was very sceptical when I tried this game at the fair and had to be convinced to give it a try. But I am glad I did. This was one of the personal highlights of the fair. Very good stuff. For me personally the best game from Mr. Wrede. 
Update: Somehow this game tends to be quite different anytime I play it! Sometimes it is an absolute blast and  sometimes it seems to be boring. Don't know why this happens! Strange thing indeed. Still a good game! But I think, I have to give it a lower vote!
Update: I have lowered my vote to a 7!

This is the boardgame that I've played that has come closest to replicating a computer civ-type of game. It's a resource management game with workers mining and moving resources so that you can build stuff and sacrifice the rest to the gruesome God Baal. Even though it's quite simple to learn, it has lots of depth and an awesome fun-factor.

Played once - this game is truly clever.  YOu get some of the concepts of tile laying from carcassone combined with actions.  It feels very tense as you race to get your offerings in...

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The optimal move is too obvious, so this reduces to being lucky in drawing tiles that give the stone resource (the only one that there isn't enough of for everyone). 
Played it again after a long time. Serious kingmaking problems and again very much scripted play (especially in the beginning). Way before the end there were only 2 out of 4 that could win the game (the people that had played before), that also didn't help. Adjusted my rating (5 became 3); I'm quite sure this won't hit the table again for a long time.

Pretty nifty and unpretentious little game.  The only problem with it is everyone is usually poised to meet the end conditions to win on the same turn which means that whoever went first wins simply because they went first.  But you do get to play with little rocks and sticks....

This game surprised me as it is from the designer of most of the Carcassone games. Unlike Carcassone, this is a good game. The rules are only slightly more complicated than Carcassone but the depth of play is great. It is a race to deliver 4 tokens to the temple but to do so requires planning...a lot of planning. You build your min-civilization while expanding the board. Where and when you build, multiply or expand can have dramatic affects on the game. There are 'power'-type cards that add a spec of variety without being unbalanced. This is a first class effort. Turns are tense and typical of a good design, there are several things you want to do but are limited. Short playing time, good components, interesting play with clear rules...this is Wrede's best game (with no close second).

Rating after one play: Disappointing. There seems to be a lot of potential here, and the bits are very nice, but it just doesn't work for me.  Second play went a bit better, but I'm not sure whether that was because or despite us mis-playing several key rules. Third play, by ALL the real rules, the game is better than I thought, but still not a favorite.

One of the better pickup and deliver games out there. I think the pieces are fabulous - the interlocking tiles overcome that problem of hexes coming apart.

Maybe the expansion spices it up a bit?

RATING: 5.5
Run of the mill pick up and deliver 'race' where players use their cylinders to move around the board (in vaguely Tikal style) in order to discover land, build houses and shrines, breed and generate mana with the ultimate aim of bringing 4 offerings to the main temple.

Great looking tiles and bits. However, gameplay is very stale and processional. It's hard to a player who gets behind to catch up especially since resources are fairly scare and disappear almost immediately. If you explore, other players will just pick up on what you've discovered. Stone is very important early on. The action cards are useful but ultimately a gamble.

Not Wrede's best.

Very clean exploration/pick-up and deliver game.  There aren't an overwhelming amount of decisions available on your turn, so the the system moves along at a nice pace.  Mostly this is a tactical game, but there is enough strategy to create a sense of direction.  I love the movement and positioning aspect of the game and I feel that there is a strong level of interaction without people feeling too picked on.  Best of all, I love the theme.  Who doesn't want to sacrafice your people to a pagan god?

RATING: 3
Gorgeous game, and that can't be stated enough.  As a race game, it also provides for good drama.  However, I can't bring myself to rate it any higher since I think that the replayability is not the highest (build a couple of villages, amass a few materials, and get the sacrifices quickly to the temple), and the differentation among players is only by how well you can optimize your action points, and the difference between winning and losing is generally only a few action points.  Nevertheless, fun for an occasional play.

UPDATE: Played it again, and at this point, it just really doesn't capture me.  I think there are better race games out there (Maharaja comes to mind) and I prefer games that have more paths to victory.  This game seems to be just too much optimization and too razor-thin that is too dependent upon what tiles you draw.

This is a exploration, pick-up-and-deliver, resource management game. The game starts with only 7 hexes revealed. Players move their tribesman around picking up resources (lumber, stone) and delivering them. For example, stone taken to the central temple earns mana, or taken to an empty plains hex with another worker allows you to build a holy stone (a way to earn more mana). You can also build huts. Huts are important because: (1) that's how you bring your 4 offerings (discs numbered 2, 4, 6, and 7; same set for all players) into play - as the hut is built, you choose one and put it underneath. You win the game by delivering these to the central temple. (2) Huts are where 2 tribesman breed to bring another tribesman into play. There are also special cards that allow you to move further, or give you other benefits. The early game consists of exploring to add more hexes to the map, collecting resources, building huts, breeding, and earning mana (needed to deliver offerings; e.g., costs 2 mana to deliver offering #2). Then, it's a race to deliver the offerings as quickly as possible. Mana is limited (each player has a max capacity of 8) so you have to be as efficient as possible.

This is a fun game that plays pretty quickly. We'll probably end up getting it, although I'm not sure if there are many different paths to victory - it seems like you may end up playing the same game many times. Still, a good game.

RATING: 5
A little too Java/Tikalish for my tastes, but I think most normal people will enjoy it :)  One potential issue here is the cards can be a bit unbalancing and can also to lead to the "bash the leader" syndrome.  One of those that I don't mind playing but wouldn't request.

Fubar Awol Variant: 1) Remove 1 of each card type leaving only 10 cards and do no recycle cards back into the deck. To get the benefit of a card, you must draw it early to beat the other players to the punch. For 2-player, use only 8 cards by removing all the cards with the "3 heads" symbol on them (Mana Theft and Expulsion). 2) require a tribe to spend 1 movement point to pick up an offering.

[Mayfair Games 2005 edition] {civilization; resource management, utility-cards, action-point; optimal 3p} A solid family game with a thin theme. Nicely designed and made. Good player interaction. Stylish bits.

Loved it!! The turns moved quickly because it was possible to think about your turn while others played. While the decisions in one turn weren’t difficult—the accumulation of many decisions about when to build and when to make sacrifices greatly affect your play efficiency. Our game was so close that in the end, it felt like every decision really mattered. I look forward to playing this one again and again.

The first playing with our group went over very well and all of us enjoyed it.  Probably the only thing that was frustrating is when we saw when one person was about to wrap up the game and there was nothing we could do about it.  This game relies on really keeping on top of where your opponents are because if they get ahead, it is very hard to keep them in check.  More plays will help see this deeper.  For that negative however we all really enjoyed it.

Great looking game and bits. For as simple as the game and rules are, there are still some ambiguities in the english version of the rules.

Some cards are clearly stronger than others.

A freewheeling game that is interesting in that players have any number of options available each turn. Mesopotamia falls short in the area of player interaction, although the rules for stealing commodities imply this is intended to be at least a semi-important component of the game. This really is a solitaire quest for efficienty in use of actions in a multiplayer setting. Not bad, but ulitmately this pick-up-and-deliver game doesn't do either ...

A very "Euro" game that moves quickly.  With a super simple rule set (nothing like Puerto Rico, Princes of Florence or Caylus) and 3 basic phases each turn there doesn't seem on the surface to be many options.  However given that you have 5 movement points and can usualy do several different things just how you spend those points make it very interesting.  In the 2nd phase is the only place you are really faced with limitations as you must decide upon 1 single action...most actions can be done multiple times if you are able but only 1 action each turn.  Add to the fact that this is one of the most beautiful games I've ever seen...stone resources are real little stones, the interlocking hexes are beautiful, everything is top notch.

As the description above, looks heavier than it is. Still, the components are fantastic (the puzzle-edged connecting hexes are brilliant) and gameplay is quick and fun and the game is over fast.  It's more of a race game where you must first build up your infrastructure, so efficiency is the key.  I'm glad I got it.

TRADED AWAY (1/18/07) --- I wasn't sure Klaus-Jürgen Wrede could ever make anything non-Carcassonne, but he finally has, and it turned out alright.  Mesopotamia is an interesting game with gorgeous pieces that make it even better, but unfortunately it lacks much in the way of variety and different paths to victory -- UPDATE: Traded away on January 18, 2007.  I played Mesopotamia four times before trading away, which I think is a fair shake for the game, and it just never struck me as something I'd be eager to play or ever suggest.  I'd be willing to play it if someone else really wanted to, but I don't think I'll miss it.  The components were nice, but the gameplay was too repetitive for me.

Very nice looking family game with a bit more depth (and rules) than Settlers. Even though the looks remind me of that classic, Mesopotamia plays very differently! It is more like an action point allocation game based on a pick up & deliver mechanic, and it really requires you to give some serious thought to your movements around the board. Still, the random elements (drawing tiles and cards) make it more of a family game than a gamers' game.

I wish I could remember why I never rated or commented on this.  It seems like a nice building/race game.  I would like to play it again, but if I see a good price on it, it's mine.

It features action points, resource management and exploration (all in a light and accessible way).
Unfortunately the cards are unbalanced and their random drawing can sometimes decide the game.
Nice bits.

Klaus-Jürgen Wrede (Carcassonne); At the center is the Ziggurat where you must bring 4 sacrifice tokens to win. But to deliver them you must have sufficient Mana reserved by praying in temples, which players build. You bring your sacrifices from 4 huts which you build, and you can breed at an empty hut to increase your people. To build huts, temples and Mana, you use rocks and timber that you collect from quarries and forests.

One of the first games i bought after the resurgance in playing boardgames. Played only 2 player games and it was dreadfull. Very dry, generic Euro probably better with 3 or more players.

Great components.The game mechanics like TIKAL. But no auction system, it will be a little bit depend on luck of explore the tiles.

Good solid more than a filler, but less than a heavy game. Good *ROCK* solid components. ;p

If you like Settlers and you like Carcassonne, you will like this game.

Really nice game. Fantastic pieces, high quality tiles and wooden bits. Game play is fast and furious. If you like tile placing games while grabbing for resources, this is for you! This is the kind of Eurogame I really enjoy!

Another one of those solid 7 games from last year.  I finally broke down and got a copy.  Nice simple mechanics with plenty of choices and close finishes.  Phalanx bits are up to their usual high quality.  The tiles could probably have been hex shaped but the interlocking design is very nice in keeping things together.

Easy to get started, nice game... At its best with 2 or 4.
Drawback: the more you play it, the more you notice most games are alike.

A pretty decent game.  Not great, but decent.  The fact that it is short keeps up the rating.  If it were longer, it would dive by a point or so.  It seems to me that there is a pretty straightforward process to victory - build huts, build people, build holy spots & raise mana limit, win.

[EDIT]: after my second game, this time with probably correct rules, the game isn't that bad but still it completely lacks excitment... there is no tension, or so it seems. maybe just because i lost so badly.... the winner seems appearent after a while without not much left to stop him
---------------------------------------


Like many others before me, I must say the game works ok, the components are very nice but the game is quite shallow and uninteresting, it lacks excitment.
I'll try it again soon to be sure.

Decent game, somewhat reminiscent of Settlers of Catan. The 'map exploring' aspect of it gives it a different level, as well as the option of stealing resources from pawns you pass by.

one of the nicest games that I ever bought ("got" for Father's Day, to be more specific). It flows like a river: you needn't do too much, but you never never wonder in a bored way where it's going to and it's never dull.

UPDATE: (241112) Played this game at the end of the night with 3 and found it extremely playable. So much so it's off the for trade list. Sure, it's not a game that'll be played all the time but there's enough fun and tension to make it worthy of keeping.
Some in my group have called this game broken. I disagree and feel it's been unfairly pushed aside due to bad play.

The last time I played, I stole a rock from an opponent and he complained incessantly for the rest of game.

It all worked out, though.  I now see his wife on the side.

Played once (with 4 players). Like in most racing games, it is quite difficult for a player to take an edge (which means everyone should remain in the race until the end, unless they make mistakes). Unfortunately, that means the winner will probably often be decided by the luck of the card draws. I might play it again to confirm that feeling, but it was not exciting or enjoyable enough for me to really ask for it again.

Interesting open system. There are a bunch of options each turn. Worth at least a few more plays. Seems like a solid design except the odd human factors issue of balancing the resources on top of the people.

(one play) Interesting game with superficial similarities to Tikal. Another game of having to maximize turn efficiency, as you get very few actions per turn to accomplish a lot of things. 

The action cards seem a bit unwieldy and out of balance with the value of other actions, but that could just be based on how our game panned out. I wanted to like the game more, but it seemed that there was far more indirect conflict and interaction than direct (at least, efficient and direct) means to really target other players. It felt like it was missing something -- a mechanic, a scoring element, a turn option -- to jack up the level of immersion.

I won the first game, but I don't think I necessarily made better or more efficient decisions. I do think there's a definite potential for  players to have turns that benefit other players more than themselves (such as in Hansa, by virtue of the final position of the boat), but it may be so subtle that it's hard to spot or evaluate.

Did not care for the imbalance in the value between wood and stone.  While the former is important in the beginning, it quickly becomes a throwaway resource after everyone has finished building their huts.  The latter, however, will always be needed since it has multiple uses rather than just one.

There seem to be very little mechanism to stop or slow down the leader.  Mesopotamia is basically a race game dressed up with various other mechanics, which while interesting, doesn't really make up the lackluster experience.

A good easy little game with a nifty premise. Seems to be lacking a little something to give it total pizazz, but would be a good kids/family game that takes very little time to learn or play.

What I said with my [b][bgcolor=#cc99ff]&nbsp;5.9&nbsp;[/bgcolor][/b] rating, and the pre-Mayfair rulebook: Moving nimbly and nicking your opponents' goods when you could have picked one up elsewhere will take you far.  Something about this game doesn't quite gel for me, though.  Hopefully, if I actually get to play two games in a row with the same ruleset (most inelegant rules I've seen since Africa), Mesopotamia will click, and I'll enjoy it again.

Now, yes, the rules are solid and probably as fair as a randomized, exploratory game can get.  This is a good game, with interesting, tough choices and gambles.  Mayfair REALLY cleaned up the rulebook!

After 1 Play: My actions felt very repetitive, and by the end of the game I was getting bored with them.  There doesn't seem to be enough variability in the set-up to change this.  Also, for a game of this length I would prefer something more strategic (as opposed to entirely tactical).

Roads & Boats (ultra) light. Easy transportation/logistic game - ressource management and ahead planing are essential. Nice introduction game if you want to try out some more complex games in this genre

RATING: 6.5
The interlocking tiles and the bits are a plus for me. The game has a great sense of progression which has been mentioned by others before. I also find it very thematic, with the little workers running around carrying goods back, building, etc.

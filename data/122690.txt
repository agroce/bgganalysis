RATING: 6
Another deck-builder. I love Dominion. What does this one do differently? Where other deck-builders build on Dominion's central economy by introducing an additional currency (usually "Magic" or "Attack") to work alongside the monetary cards, Star Trek goes one step further and introduces four (or five including Defence) currencies. In Dominion, you need 8 Gold to buy a Province (the game winning cards). In Star Trek, you might need 2 Attack, 3 Speed, 1 Diplomacy, and 3 Experience, for example, to claim an equivalent victory-point card (here called Missions). So the game becomes a kind of crossover between the deck-building, and set-collecting genres. 

Two main problems arise, and they have little to do with the multiple currency system, which actually works quite well. The first is the heavy-handed use of the theme. Pictures are big, text is small. Most cards are unique and it takes some focus to work out what they do. For a non-Trekkie, the heavy use of theme (as illustration only: the game mechanic is pretty abstract) is distracting to the point of being almost impenetrable. The second problem is the arbitrary nature of the missions. Because these arise randomly, you have no idea of which currencies to collect in order to win the game. The only strategy apparent is to collect a bit of everything and hope that useful missions turn up.

It's not a bad deck-builder, and is a step further from Dominion than the rip-off titles (Tanto Cuore, Penny Arcade etc.) but unless you're a Star trek lover, I really wouldn't bother. Just play Dominion. It is so streamlined and accessible, it makes these supposed next-generation-deckbuilders (excuse the pun) seem unwieldy and clunky by comparison.

RATING: 5.5
Well, the rulebook could use alot of work. But once you get the swing of the game, it plays fairly like any other deck builder and yet has its own unique vibe. The theme is what does it for me - love the original series and there are dozens of references. However, it doesn't separate enough to make it a keeper for me, so likely going on the trade pile.

A more competent deckbuilder than I expected, and with a nice adaptation of Star Trek themes. It has a variety of strategies, most of which are not worth pursuing, but the few that are are decently well-balanced against each other. The learning curve is difficult to navigate and it might take two or three games to wrap your head around it.

Took me awhile to get used to this because it's different from the other DBG's I've played.  Once I understood the different decks and how they worked together, it made sense.  Minor complaints include really small text and the theme does feel "weird" especially when we can recruit non-Federation personnel to complete missions or events.  Designed for 2-4 players.

When I see this game on the shelf, I want to play it. The Star Trek Original Series theme is a huge part of the appeal, but the game itself has a somewhat unique feel overall. Like many deckbuilders, the game suffers for lack of individualization between players -- all are flying the same ship, and buying from the same pool of cards -- but there is some head-to-head interaction between players, and it just seems to hold my attention very well.

RATING: 7.5
The Star Trek DBG's get better with each new version! The balancing mechanisms are even more pronounced in this one. First off, there is no getting a new ship. Also, the Starter cards are more helpful in the early going. Additionally, many of the Missions give XP as rewards, which lets you still get great cards even though your deck does not have a high percentage of Basic Characters. I will play next time with the Draft Mission Variant, which lets you have your own Missions that only you can finish. The Infection variant was a nice change of pace as well. The Infection cards were bad, but not completely. I would love to see one more Star Trek DBG (based on Enterprise, please???) that really keeps up this quality.

LoTR card game is getting the play at the moment but this is in the "play next" queue.

LoTR went upstairs and this might be a thing for early new year. Not suggesting it's the same depth of game but it might suit me and Alex for a bit of an alternative fun game plus I love TOS photography on the cards.

VERY ANNOYING - Almost incomprehensible rules and the game is completely not supported any more!
THE PLUS SIDE - It still looks great with original photography from TOS, my favourite and there are many support resources out there that explain the badly written rules. It looks to be an ok, perhaps ok plus game. It must be tried in 2017.

A thematic and engrossing deck builder that's full of card interactions with lots of missions and rewards. The cards have rich effects and being able to upgrade characters is really nice. The rulebook could use some clarifications and not be so assuming. Once you figure out how to play it's a fun game. The mechanics are easy but the gameplay is not. You must work to improve your deck in order to complete missions, win battles, and conquer events.

Deck Building Card Game.

RATING: 7
The Star Trek deck building games are not bad, and actually can be credited with expanding the design parameters of deck builders.

This series may not be ground-breaking, but like any decent game these do give you a variety of interesting choices each turn without feeling like you're too reliant on luck to garner a win.

Effort was made to give the many unique cards thematic abilities, even if the overall game fails to immerse you in a story (which is the thematic holy grail of board games). The card images are good quailty stills from the shows and a reasonable few illustrations.

Bottom line: If you enjoy deck builders and Star Trek, this offering will entertain you and fill the prerequisite niche in your collecton.

There are a couple of unnecessarily fiddly mechanics here not present in The Next Generation – The Next Phase (2012).  I would still play both, but the latter has a more efficient design.

A solid improvement over the last version. Not game shaking, but lots of nice touches. 
The classic characters are cool and very welcome, but the lack of new flagships to acquire is a bit of a let down.

This one is an interesting case in my collection. My rating for it is in fact an average. First of all, I think that this game's theme is very niche and today I wouldn't think of introducing it to someone who wasn't a TOS fan. Even for this demographic, the game has high barriers of entry, too high I fear for what it finally delivers. For starts, the rule book is a mess, the worst I have ever read. Then there is the Starbase deck, which comprises the cards you buy along the game: it has 80 cards, most of them unique, which means hours of card reading and parsing before your plays begin to flow and you can enjoy the game (I will never forget my first session, which was left unfinished after three hours and cost us a player). The game itself is unpolished and unbalanced, with cards which are totally OP, specially in a two player game. All this deserves a 4. On the other hand, for my group the theme and the deck building mechanism were enough to carry us up to a point where we are now familiar with all the cards and many of the possible combos. So at this point, the game is simply a blast. We have lots of fun with it and, with all its imperfections, it has cult status for us. I have no doubts we will be playing this game for years. And this deserves a 9.

  A bit of a strategy learning curve.  My rating has gone up with the game the more times I've actually played.   There is quite a lot of game play strategy.  One of the best Dominion clones, far better than Thunderstone.

RATING: 5
An interesting deck building game with a normal or infected/harder mode which is interesting but somewhat ruined by the combat which seems more an interruption than anything. 

Also in the lead of the games played/collection with the saddest box ever, box looks great from the outside & inside is 90% cardboard with a few hundred cards plus the game book.

El mejor Deck Building Game al que he jugado. Muy temático e inmersivo y con cosas que lo hacen único y diferente a otros juegos que usan esta misma mecánica, como la mayor facilidad para limpiar el mazo y afinarlo pudiendo eliminar o mejorar las cartas básicas segun nos convenga, la no repetición de cartas de personajes o la condición de victoria, que se consigue al llegar a una determinada cantidad de puntos los cuales se obtienen cumpliendo misiones.

While this lacks the modes that TNG has, and the absence of ships in the mission deck is noticeable, I think this is a big improvement on the previous Star Trek Deck Building Games. Characters are more powerful (More give you XP as well), the game is far more interactive, and the overall card presentation is much better. I still don't know that I would say this is in the upper echelon of deck builders out there, and I think I still prefer the TNG version in a number of ways, but the TOS Deck Building Game is solid, and should appease fans of the show.

If I started with this one in the series, I would have got rid of this fast and not touched the other ones; too much fiddly card play, and not enough combinations for my taste. BUT, since I did learn the Next Generation first and loved that, I will keep this one to possibly mix in. However, this might be the worst of the set.

I very much like the draft mission aspect, and the handheld devices idea.

Beautiful and colorful graphic design.

RATING: 6
I like the way the missions and the attributes work to earn points. That is the one element that sets this game a part some. I also like the number of unique cards. The way the cards interact almost have a CCG feel, that is not always found in deck building games. The theme is both a strength and a weakness. The makers dug deep in filling out the characters. This creates a satisfying feeling when, for example, I recognized the character from the episode with Kahn that he persuaded to help him. However, it can be kind of odd and thematically off putting to have Kirk, a Klingon, and Romulan, and Abraham Lincoln making up the bridge crew. I feel like this game has some good ideas but falls short of really distinguishing itself as a "must get" deck builder. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I rated this game a little higher than it really deserves based on the presentation.  The rules are atrocious.  There are a lot of things that aren't really clear from rules.  We made several guesses.  After looking around in the forums, some were right, some were wrong.  The game is fairly free-form, so it would benefit from some really clear, well laid out rules.  Perhaps it would make more sense to someone who has played the Next Generation version previously.  As an aside, a lot of the issues reminded me of rules problems from the early days of SWCCG.

Despite struggling through the rules, I found it to be a pleasant and enjoyable system.  It is deck-building game, though most of the cards in your deck will be unique (I think).  Oddly, we found ourselves referring to the basic crewmen as copper, silver, and gold.  I really like the aspect of putting together your crew and then completing missions to earn points.  Being a Trek fan helped, I am sure.  Still, I expect to be picking up a copy of this when I get a chance.  [12/09/2012]

Attracted to this game for three reasons (1) deckbuilding (2) Star Trek (3) Paul Darcy's excellent solo playthrough videos.  
I am adapting Mr. Darcy's variant so that fewer of the card effects are overlooked in solo mode, and I want to make the game more difficult.  

The theme itself is "balanced" if that makes sense.  For example, there is Starship combat in the game but not overmuch. Just like in the show.  Plus, it seems that a lot of success depends upon your diplomatic ability but that is only something that grows with your deck construction. You start with almost zero ability as a diplomat, and I find that VERY thematic.
Hugely overpackaged but I love the box art!  Unfortunately there will not be any expansions because Bandai said so, but I might get another base game so that I can actually create a scenario explicitly with more combat (I am thinking Romulan encounters!).
Update: I have finished my solo variant and it's really good. I am going to raise my rating to 9 based upon this variant.

Greatly improves the previous Star Trek Deck Building Games: smoothing out play and cutting away a lot of the legacy-concepts that have nothing to do with Star Trek and were only there because "Gamerz will want to upgrade their ships" (for example).

I'm not even really a fan of TOS but I enjoyed playing my friend's copy much more than my two Next Gen versions! Although very polished, it's still very much the same game though: a big and muddled celebration of all the people and moments in the Star Trek universe - gameplay doesn't really correspond in any meaningful way to what actually went on in your favourite episodes.

Gather together the ultimate Star Trek crew, and test them against whatever Space might throw at them! That's the game - and this iteration of it is perfect. I'm looking forward to the DS9 set!

RATING: 8
This is one of the best thematic games based on a pop-culture genre that I've ever played.  The way that missions are completed through the game is one of the best concepts I've seen in deck-building games.

I'll rate the standard scenario a '8', and the infection scenario only a '6'.  But, I have no problem just playing the standard scenario, so I'm recording 8 in BGG.

The rules are atrocious.  I'm pretty sure that they never had a single person test the game using only the rulebook as a guide.  It really needs a rewrite.  There's an FAQ in the forum here that answers all of the most important unanswered questions, but it's written so concisely that it's hard to understand unless you've tried (and failed) to play the game already.

The order that a player takes a turn is completely up to the player.  After you have finally read all the rules and all the questions in the forum, you finally have an idea of which order a turn will normally occur, but it's complex enough that an example really should have been given.  For this reason, it's probably best to learn the game from an already experienced player.

After our first few plays, we had far more questions than answers and were ready to trash the game.  Thanks to all of the great FAQs, we were able to fill in the considerable loopholes and omissions in the rules and see the great game that was hidden inside.

We went through a similar experience with a lesser-known BanDai game, Uncharted, and enjoy it very much.  The nice folks at the company need to hire a better writer/editor, but can produce some very good games.

I LIKE the theme, the different card abilities and the multiple "stats" that are used on the cards... I DISLIKE the tiny, tiny font size and that the missions come up randomly, so you need to build up evenly, also the rule book kinda sucks...

I'm not a Star Trek fan and am fairly burned out on deck building games, but this was better than I expected.  The cards can be used in multiple ways.  Being able to use cards as handheld items, to complete missions, and strengthen your deck kept it interesting.  I also liked the fact that the main deck was full of mostly unique cards versus just using the same dozen or so cards for the entire game.

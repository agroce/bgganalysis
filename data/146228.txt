RATING: 6
What sets 1714 apart is that it is more about the making of peace than the making of war.  At the heart of the game are concessions of lands and trade routes made by the Bourbons in an attempt to buy allied countries (the players) off.  Concessions are both a major source of vps and - just as the Bourbons intended - a drain on your country's will to fight. Maintaining a military campaign is difficult enough, thanks to only one player per turn being allowed to take each action (attack, move, recruit, etc.) and the temptation of playing cards for their text, forfeiting the right to take an action.  With a low will to fight, going to war also becomes expensive. 

If the concept of all players being allied against the Bourbons leads you to imagine that 1714 is a cooperative game, then think again.  While there is no conflict between the players' armies, so many of the cards offer the potential to do harm to your allies.  You will regularly be visited by foreign emissaries saying "I could do this to you.  What's it worth for me to do it to someone else?"  

I have a couple of significant reservations. The first is that the card effects can be devastating, particularly late in the game when there is little time to recover.  In my last game the Death of Joseph I reduced everyone but Austria to not at war and was immediately followed by the Agreement of L'Hospitalet, which wiped out the British, Dutch, Portuguese and Savoyard forces in Castile and Aragon because they were not at war.  Ouch! 

My second reservation concerns the concessions.  In replying to a rules query, the designer explained that concessions were colour coded according to early, mid and late war because they were sorted that way during playtesting.  This had led to issues for players whose key concessions came together in one clump.  The fix of randomizing the appearance of concessions is only a partial solution; randomized clumping is still a possibility. 

These reservations take some of the lustre off what is otherwise a thoroughly engaging, highly interactive design.  

Production quality and artwork are both very good.  The English rules are pretty bad.  Mostly, the sins are of omission.  The failure to explain the significance of ports being regarded as adjacent is just one example.

Wish that it were more wargame, and there are still some annoying bugs in the English translation of the rules.  For all that, it captures well the flavour of the historical period.  The hex-grid map is a nice tip of the historical hat, intentional or otherwise, to the early days of Avalon Hill and SPI/S&T games.  The map reminds me of the days of Redmond Simonsen, who had the gift of making less look like more, and with flair.  

------------------------------------------------

I have had enough of my questions patiently addressed to removed my negative rating; it now sits as a neutral 5.  I did find the opening turns to be dreadfully slow and dull, sort of like walking across the English Channel, a la Gilligan's Island: take two steps and come up for air; take another two steps and come up for air.  

------------------------------------------------

The rules are ABYSMAL, to say the least.  They are among the worst rules I have ever seen in my too-many decades of gaming.  Keeping them to eight pages might have saved money, but it does nothing for those of us who actually want to play the game properly.  

I am rating it a "one" in order to draw attention to how poorly written are the rules.  When the questions are clarified, the rating should change into more positive territory.  Honestly, how could the design team--designer(s), developer(s), and play-testers allow this mountain of ambiguity to happen?  :(

1st Play: Took too long to sort through the opaque rules. Some have blamed the poor translation from Catalan, the reality is that they are vague, ambiguous and poorly structured. Next there are glaringly dreadful design issues with the game. The concession cards have the same backs as the other decks so can't be told apart when placed in their draw piles. The concession cards have three face colours when only one is needed and despite the designer claiming its because he didn't want to introduce another (4th) colour, they could have reverted to one. The cards will always be poorly located for at least 2 players and the text is not just tiny but again agonisingly ambiguous. The truth is probably that the game was printed and then they changed the rules. Once the game starts, its clear that decisions are few if you are in 4th and 5th position. Being able to get the actions you need is more important than any clever text and if you are lucky if you get both. Turn order is so important it would be foolish to surrender a good position.

All in this is a painfully dire game chock full of chaos and random activity that strips out most meaningful decisions and certainly all fun. Played with both war-gamers and heavy euro enthusiasts, I guessed this might fall between two stools but it landed miles away from both. We voted to end the game a third of the way through, a first in our playing group. An embarrassingly amateur and ill conceived design that beggars belief that it had any play testing. I am aghast that some people rate this game so highly. I am wondering why I don't rate this a '1' because by all definitions it is broken.

A very intriquing card-driven game based on the the War of the Spanish Succession. Five players (best) represent factions of the Great Alliance set against the Bourbons and their allies (Castile and Bavaria). Each is trying to wrest key locations and concessions in order to best capitalize on the new order that results.

The game end is triggered either by the defeat of the Bourbon troops or the fall of the fortress of Barcelona. The way the game end is triggered will determine how the final scores are tallied, and could see one faction that thought they were poised to triumph fall by the wayside, and is a very clever take on variable victory conditions.

An asymmetric game that has some appearance of a war-game but is more of a Euro in its implementation. I found the game quick to catch on to (fairly simple rules), but having a lot of depth as players jockey for turn order and to best manage their resources and board position. Competition between players is indirect (allies after all), but by no means less cutthroat than any well designed multi-player game of strategy. I look forward to more play of this innovative title.

RATING: 6
Essentially no simulation value - either as a military 
game or as a geo-political one. The interplay of familiar
 mechanisms (CDG, action selection, negotiation) is very 
interesting. The only real problem as a euro is that the 
rules, and especially the cards are not always easy to 
interpret. This strikes me as a possible post-patch gem.
Right now though, I wouldn't feel comfortable bringing it
 to a gaming session until a FAQ comes out for all the
 questions I raise during my playthrough.


The actual military aspects are abstracted to almost a
backdrop. This is a game maybe more about the peace
than the war itself - with a blend of euro and CDG 
mechanisms. Very clever design that serves as a good
framework for negotiations between players.

"Story is the foundation of all entertainment."  George Louis Costanza

If we game in order to be entertained, then we're searching for a story.  And, from Charlotte's Web to Antony and Cleopatra, the stories that provide that entertainment grow in depth and complexity as we mature.  I have been an active gamer most of my life, and 1714: Case of the Catalans presently tops the heap by a relatively wide margin.

At age 12 (1976), I was as ensconced in American popular culture as the next kid.  Among the stories of that culture were a raft of WWII movies and Laverne & Shirley.

The latter was a mainstay of my TV viewing, pablum for American pop culture, topping the Nielsen ratings.  I recall that it ran one evening against Max von Sydow's portrayal of the life of Jesus, to which Johnny Carson later quipped that "'The Greatest Story Ever Told' lost to the worst story ever told."

The WWII movies, meanwhile, were a romanticized foundation of our political consciousness.  By 1976, American boys had moved from worshiping heroes to worshiping antiheroes, but it was romance just the same.

In the realm of gaming, Stratego topped the heap for us then.  So, when my best friend and I saw a copy of PanzerBlitz at a sidewalk sale, we eagerly dove in.  Coming off of Stratego, however, we weren't ready for even that much reality in warfare.

Still, we grew.  Battle of the Bulge came to seem trite; Black Hawk Down seemed real.  I haven't watched a network TV show in . . . do the networks still make TV shows?  Oh, I see the trailers for them and understand what they are selling, mindless cynicism mostly.

So what makes a story?  In gaming, we commonly refer to "soul," is "the incorporeal and immortal essence of a living being," that which cannot be seen or felt, but from which meaning may still be derived.  The human mind is blessed (and cursed) with the ability to abstract, to understand that which is not apparent.

Abstraction is not popular in our culture.  Laverne & Shirley was early evidence of this; reality TV is the current extreme.  The masses prefer to have cultural meaning slap them across the face, which brings me to gaming.

Gaming is a remarkable medium.  A writer authors a story with words.  A director produces it with images.  A game designer gives his audience merely the tools with which to discover the story.

Those tools, called "mechanics," typically consist of a combination of dice, cards, cubes, and meeples.  Through these media the player makes a series of decisions, which reveal the story the designer wishes to convey.  Thus, not unlike Woody Allen's "Purple Rose of Cairo," the audience participates in the story.

But the remarkability of gaming does not stop there.  Not only does the audience discover the story through its participation, each individual does so through interaction with others.  Thus, different opponents and sessions will reveal the story to you in different ways.

Each entertainment medium - written, drawn, acted or filmed - must first get you to open your wallet.  This is the science of marketing, which I won't discuss here.

Once he or she gets you to invest your money, the storyteller must get you to invest your time.  This is the art of engagement, without which the audience will not even experience the end of the story.

On this issue, movies have it easy, able to capture attention with a series of stunning vision images and sounds.  Indeed, many of these openings - e.g., "Patton" and "Jaws" - are staples of our popular culture. 

Lacking visual and auditory cues, written works have it tougher.  Yet, many opening lines remain memorable: "It was the best of times.  It was the worst of times."  "Now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this Sun of York."

Compared to these media, the threshold for engaging in a game is breathtakingly high.  Yes, there is the glorious opening of the box and unfolding of the board.  But the gaming audience is not allowed even to simply begin play.  Rather, it must understand the rules.  Movie trailers might be obnoxious, but are nothing compared to a 47-page rulebook.
 
In order to make game decisions engaging, a designer must develop mechanics that strike a balance.  If the effect your decisions have on revelation of the story is unclear, then the audience will lose patience.  His or her participation is just an exercise in randomness.  If, on the other hand, the effect of a player's decisions are too obvious, then the audience is left bored.

Beyond game mechanics, there is the question of theme.  I find evaluation of this issue somewhat more subjective.  I strongly prefer themes of human history, rather than fantasy or sci-fi.  That said, no amount of theme can overcome a dissatisfying mechanic.  (Abstracts, to me, present the worst of both worlds.)

So, given the foregoing, what puts 1714 at the top of the heap?  It starts with story.  I find the story of the Catalans compelling and resonant to today.  Westphalian sovereignty created a fundamental tension of human relations, in what circumstances and to what extent may one sovereign impose its will on the domestic tranquility of another.

Stories of war are inherently compelling.  Stories of peace are just as compelling, and far more difficult to tell.  More interesting to me than the many stories of WWII is the story of how the peace of Versailles failed.

1714: The Case of the Catalans tells a story of peace imposed, at significant human toll, on a sovereign people.

But a designer only starts with a story.  From there, he or she must draw you into the decisions that tell the story.  1714's superiority exists in the way it creates interesting decisions for its players.  Let's begin with some context.

I cut my teeth on hex-and-counter wargames.  Far from a "golden age" of gaming, I recall it as the Dark Ages.  Whatever might be said as to a golden age of gaming, however, I recall the 70's as a gaming desert.  The game mechanics, particularly, were very samey.  Once we came of driving age, we typically had a group of at least three players.  This left 80% of our game collection unusable.  Into the void rode D&D.

Leaving the hobby for 25 years to have a career and family, I came back to the so-called weuros, wargames using euro mechanics.  This suited my desire to use my kids as game partners.

Intrigued by the CDG mechanic, I wandered into a session of Clash of Monarchs.  I was thoroughly humbled; the game rendered every hex-and-counter experience childsplay.  I respect games like CoM greatly, and look forward to dipping my toe back in those waters.  I question, however, the desire for "simulation" in gaming.  Certainly, we all play (be it Carcassone or World in Flames) to make interesting decisions.  I question the notion that any gaming decision materially simulates one made in real life.

I begin with a preference for multi-player games.  Aside from marriage, life is rarely a binary event.  Prior to the publication of Dune in 1979, the multi-player wargame genre was barren.  (Kingmaker was attractive, but so mechanically clunky.)

My next preference is for human stories.  I'll take The Godfather over Star Wars any day.  I am particularly interested in stories too obscure to have made my history texts - ergo, I prefer The King's Speech over Saving Private Ryan.  Once we have our setting, the next question is how compellingly the game mechanics teach us about it.

The first issue with mechanics is the balance of strategy and tactics.  I.e., what is the payoff period of a typical decision?  Does it merely tee up the next decision, or does it reveal itself slowly over time?

The next mechanical issue is randomness.  I do not abhor it, but settling a 14-hour, six-player game on the result of a single die roll feels too arbitrary.  As the number of random elements decrease, game mechanics tend to reduce to scripted moves (Chess representing an extreme here; I find that Puerto Rico suffers in this way.)  To mitigate such a scripted experience, designers can introduce randomness negotiation.

The inherent problem with a negotiation mechanic is that it tends to induce kingmaking, where the last place player uses his/her final turn(s) to simply take out the leader.  Of the anti-kingmaking mechanics, a popular one is hidden objectives.

I typically don't care for hidden objectives, finding them an artifice.  Furthermore, I tend to trust player integrity, that my colleagues will not kingmake.

Against these criteria, 1714: Case of the Catalans succeeds famously.  It presents a human story about which I learned nothing in (19 years of) school.  Its mechanics feature no dice and mitigated random card draws.  (Five cards are drawn; in turn order, each player chooses one.  The cards generally effect non-dramatic changes in game state.)

It also uses hidden objectives.  However, it mitigates the randomness of that effect in two ways.  First, the hidden objectives have a relatively muted effect.  More importantly, it gives players a way to eliminate that effect.  So, if you cannot reach your objectives, then you can work to eliminate everyone from scoring them.

1714 shines in allowing wide open negotiation.  The game is simply a framework for that negotiation.  It surpasses other pure negotiation games (e.g., Diplomacy, Chinatown) in the nuance of those negotiations.

Like most games that are based on negotiation, it requires thoughtful play.  A kamikaze player will tend to ruin a session.  If you're playing with kamikazes or kingmakers, find a new game group.

All of which returns me to the notion of soul in boardgaming.  It consists of something abstract to the human senses.

The debate about realism in gaming is a distraction.  Gaming is, by definition, not a simulation.  The value of a given design is measured precisely in the extent to which the designer helps you understand the circumstance he or she depicts.

I cannot reach a full understanding of the tragedy that was the War of the Spanish Succession.  This game, however, brings me an understanding of its subject far beyond any other game I have played.

The Catalans, like all small nations oppressed by larger ones, emit a high pitched whiny tone. But in this case they've emitted a game. I'm sure the BGGers (and their Game Box cousins) can tie themselves in knots about whether it's a wargame or not, but it is definitely a game about a war. The five players (Austria, Britain, the UP, Savoy and Portugal) attempt to negotiate between each other while beating the horrid Bourbons (France, Castile and Bavaria). Each player has hidden goals (bits of the Spanish empire he'd like to nick) they then try to get things from each other and from the Bourbons. These can affect troops, will-to-fight and resources. i've barely opened it but it looks deuced interesting.

BUT I bet folks are going to find the rules too short.

I was surprised and saddened by how much I was bored by this game. I thought it would hit a sweet spot - wargame with some strategic-level resource management and a big dollup of negotiation. But the wargame element was nil, the resource management was a rather boring rondel-esque affair, and the cards were crazy swingy and led to rather annoying stick-up kind of negotiations. I'm sure this will float some people's boats. Just not mine.

RATING: 8
Very innovative hybrid game about War of the Spanish Succession. Interesting mix of euro-mechanics with strong historical flavor.
Due to hidden Goal Cards we don't know for sure how many points have our opponents. That creates tension between players and forces them to take risk. Luck in Concession cards may be important, but it's not a deciding factor.
I think, that this game is a hidden gem - many will not like it, but those, who play it and understand design philosophy will be satisfied, as I am.
5-player game highly recommended. Less player unbalance whole game.

I believe this is the first 1 that I have ever scored a game. It is also the first game where the players at my club have unanimously decided to 'Lem' (stop playing before the end).

Where do I start? 
- The poorly conceived rulebook, that has to date required 83 threads and 429 posts on rules PLUS a 5 page FAQ
- This game has clearly not had enough playtesting, and I can't imagine that it has EVER had a blind playtest
- The game is broken; it was the opinion, not of one or two players, but all five players that the game was playing them, rather than them playing the game; there were no meaningful choices
- Complete luck of the draw, I happened to be 4th player - so had little choice in which card to select...but the cards that were left to me meant that I was going to be 4th or 5th player next turn. This happened 5 turns in a row.
- Unless you are early in the playing order, do not expect any meaningful actions to be available; I played a complete game where I was not able to take a single MOVE or ATTACK action in the whole game, nor was I able to do anything to get myself to be in a position to do so
- The cards that do come out are completely swingy and overpowered. Want to go two levels up the WTF track? Well, early doors, that is likely to cost you 12 resources, but if you are the lucky player that gets to chose the right card, you can buy this for a mere 4 resources - WHAT????? Some person through no use of skill gets to acquire this power
- In the first 6 turns that were played, I believe 5 cubes were moved on the board - NOTHING HAPPENS, chiefly because there is no way for more than 1 or 2 players to do anything on a turn

Note to self: NEVER PLAY THIS GAME AGAIN, and DO NOT BELIEVE THE HYPE

Rather unique and strange game.

First of all, do not be misled by the theme of the game, the hex map, or random comments describing the game as "hybrid" or "waro", this is mostly card drafting eurogame, however thematic. If you approach the game expecting "hybrid" experience, you will be very disappointed. 

That being said, it is one of the best implementation of a theme I have ever seen, which is ultimately the game's strongest positive. If you are interested in the War of the Spanish Succession, this is the game for you.

The game is also very well produced and looks nice, good value component-wise.

I have not seen similar combination of mechanics (and the map) in any other game. Nevertheless, I cannot say I find it particularly great, merely interesting. Below I list assorted observations:

- The game length can vary greatly, but expect app. 3 hours. The game is generally too long for the level of complexity it offers, which also ties to the next point.

- The game can become very static easily. The map is mostly empty and the "relevant" spaces to be occupied are relatively few. Your options in your turn tend to be very constrained at best (due to limited availability of actions and the struggle for turn order) and you -will- end up with nothing to do (often if you are unlucky).

- The game is very unforgiving. If you fall behind, there is relatively little you can do about it.

- The importance of cards (as I noted, this is a card drafting game above all else) produces too much randomness for my taste in such a long game.

- There are some balance issues, although not game-breaking (some cards significantly stronger than others, factions imbalanced as well to some extent).

I will play the game again, but probably not purchase it.

Feels like the uncouth country cousin of the COIN series.

Action selection (with 5 players) is even more restricted and the card powers seem even more uneven and potentially crippling than in COIN. However if you like the take-that nature of the card-play in COIN then you will probably like this as well. 

The history is interesting and the overall concept of having to maintain a Will-to-fight to stay combative being eroded by the concessions (VP's) you have already managed to obtain, is quite clever.

Probably needed a professional developer to smooth out some of the rough edges.

The mirage of a 5 player card driven game which is short and sweet is a very seductive one. Does this game deliver on its promises?

I believe there is potential here for a good game, but some rules are confusing even if it is a game that is pretty simple rules-wise. 

It has beautiful and evocative art so that is always a great plus in my book. 

For now this looks like a coop game where you want to come on top while not wanting the ship to sink, so to speak, while this concept is not new I don't think it was done in a "weuro" type of game. For now my experience of the game is so little (just one play) that I cannot tell if this is a solid design or not, even if I think it is. 

Future plays will tell what will be.

RATING: N/A
One play. Everyone is in the same alliance, but every form of interaction is about disadvantaging, blocking, or attacking the other players. You get to take each action relatively infrequently, and have very few armies to spread about, so optimising your gain and timing each right is tricky and interesting. Having almost everything negotiable is excellent, in my one play we had people trading resources, actions, card selections, concessions very frequently. I only took the concessions I needed for my goals, but this left me without much significant to negotiate with and ended up costing me more in getting the bad end of negotiations I couldn't muscle in on. The game felt a little long, but I think we had a mix of odd circumstances: Not entering mid war until quite late as no treaties came up, and forgetting to shuffle in the late war cards (with all their siege icons) for a turn. Felt a bit like a really Euro COIN game. Brimming with interesting ideas, I am very keen to try this again.

The Savoy player pointed out they had very few armies to play with, they were all deployed almost instantly. I'm not sure if that's an issue - as those cubes were almost always under threat, and needed negotiation/actions to protect the points they were sitting on.

This is a truly innovative and clever design. It turns the ordinary focus of a conflict simulation on it's head, and compels players to focus on the objectives of the peace rather than the see-saw of the fortunes of war. Since most of human history involves small wars fought for limited aims, this game really captures the flavor of the "sport of kings."  For a 5 player game of some depth, the pacing is quite good, and I didn't find much lag or down time.  The very nature if this game is cynical, and since all players are actually allies in the coalition against Phillip, you will quickly understand Napoleon's dictum that he would rather fight an ally than be one.  Ivan is to be commended for such an elegant first design.  It captures the feel of the period quite well, and I believe this could be the first of a series of games, with modifications, it might also simulate the Congress of Vienna or even Versailles.  Highly recommended.

I haven't played the game yet. The mechanics seem sound to me. I have also heard generally good things about it. But I struggle to understand how a wargame supposed to be historically accurate ends up dividing Spain into the Crowns of Castille and Aragon which had ceased to exist two centuries before. Wouldn't have been a better choice speak of Bourbon dominated Spain and Hapsburg dominated Spain?. I also think that the areas in the map do not accurately depict the zones of Bourbon and Habsbourg dominance. Probably that is just a coincidence but the map seem to match the discredited revisionist historical accounts of some pancatalan nationalists. Anyway, I would love to try it.

*All Comments Based on Solo Play*

A really great game idea, with nice looks and historical feel. Involves interesting euro style decisions. A bit too abstract or handwavey in certain instances where design considerations seem to focus on keeping the game simple or interesting at the cost of representation. Still when played with the intent to negotiate with fellow players it does seem to give a gestalt appreciation of the conflict. Rules have to be worked out both for translation issues and because certain rules are not intuitive and the rule book is not written formally enough to endorse always taking the literal interpretation.

Gains value for being unique and fun.

Plays solitaire well in my opinion, I never really hesitated before playing another turn, it comes at you in manageable chunks with only a few options per choice, but still some interesting choices when considering other players.

Very clever implementation of this conflict, the cards are full of well documented history, and the game plays nicely, although I think it only shines with 5 players.

High interaction, constant conflict with hidden objectives. I enjoyed my plays.

The game is a 2-5 player "waro" where on the surface it looks like a war game but is actually a Euro.  Each player takes on one of the "allies" fighting France and Catalan but in reality, you are fighting for certain parts of the world and trying to hamper the plans of your other allies.  

It was a surprisingly good game with different play styles for each country.  It rewards repeated plays.  

The one downside of this game is the rules are a translation from Spanish and are not detailed enough.  The original rules were not well done and the translation into English is not well done.  This has hurt this game.  

If you can take the time to go online and figure out the rules, the game is worth the investment.  It reminds me a bit of some of the old Martin Wallace "Waro's".

I've played it a couple of times, great game. It seems a collaborative game in the sense that all players fight against the Bourbon kings, but they use the French and Spanish armies to attack each other, and even if France loses the war only one player wins.

Usually the war ends with all sides exhausted and the victory points come from the parts of the Spanish Empire that each player has received during the treaties that are signed from time to time. As each player has some secret objectives that have more value for him, there is a hidden score solved in the end of the game.

The game mechanics are a mixture of worker placement and card driven, with all cards shown at the beginning of a round and players deciding which they will take, following an order (like the COIN system but with more depth). Cards can cost you production points and allow you to do some actions or they can be used to gain production points. Also, some cards will trigger Bourbon offensives or, in the latter part of the game, attacks on Catalonia and Barcelona. This is important because the game ends if Barcelona falls, so all players have interest in keeping the Catalans in the war while plundering more and more of the Spanish Empire.

At the end the winner is not the player with the biggest army or more military achievements but the player who has achieved more of their government's secret objectives and pieces of the Spanish Empire without being themselves torn by the war.

Edit 2015: after having played some more times, I've written an extensive review: https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1382419/case-catalans-considered

Played twice and glad I didn't buy it. While the concept of a light war/Euro on a relatively unknown subject is appealing the game is hampered mainly by two things. First the rules are not great and seem to have suffered somewhat in being translated to English.

Worse though is grafting a somewhat chaotic situation onto a card drafting mechanic where its possible to get stuck in a feedback loop of sorts where you end up picking last too often. This results in sub optimal cards. And each action can only be undertaken by one player per turn. So again if you're picking last, you're hosed. Thematically it makes no sense why only one power per turn could build troops for instance. 

Very frustrating game to play.

A Euro/wargame hybrid.  Has some good stuff going for it, but the board ended up too static, probably because attacking something only left it open for your opponent to waltz in.  Sharing locations for points also odd.  I had Austria travel all over the Mediterranean the last turn to grab scoring spaces, which seemed wrong.  Nobody made use of the leaders, as the effects seemed a bit underpowered.  I'm so used the the point to point maps or area maps of CDGs the hex map in this was jarring!  An interesting effort.  Not sure what I think of it yet.

RATING: 8
More a strategic game than a simulation.
A different game for me (it's a new challenge for me), because of the game system (variable turn order), that makes you think about what to do to have a better initiative in the next round, if you haven't it now.
Also you can negotiate the effects of the cards with your "friends" (the Allies, of course), even buy those cards, paying they usually with money (resources).
Your primary objectives are known at the game start, but the possibility to get them will suddenly appear during the game; if then you aren't in a good position, your objective will fly away to another hand, because there are some objectives shared by different players.
And the Bourbons? You move the Bourbons!! Only to difficult your Allies, of course (you're bad!!).  :)
For a Catalan, as me, it's interesting to see how our "Allies" are more focused in their objectives than respecting the alliance with the Catalans...
I have the Devir (Catalan) version of the game, with a very good quality map, cards and wooden pieces.
Finally, I'm so proud a Catalan designs a very good game like that...

Update: Mar 2015

Hmmm, seems like we made some significant rules errors... but I still consider the game overrated.

Players CAN receive revenue based on card cost AND choose to perform an action... whereas we played if a player chooses money based on card cost, you could not then  perform an action.  Big difference.

Still wished, despite the eurogame nature of the design, that there was a stronger tie-in between game mechanics and the historic setting.

Willing to play again with the correct rules to see if my evaluation changes.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Comment based on only one learning game where the rules were not well taught...

Anyway, this is essentially a eurogame with an interesting historical theme, the Spanish Succession, a period of history that I know very little of.  

There are no simulation aspects at all in this game, or at least game mechanisms that a wargamer would consider to be important in a simulation.  In fact, the opposite is true.  Many game mechanics don't make sense at all from a historical/simulation pov.

There is historical flavour in the map and card references to historic events, people, battles and locations, but the game provides very little overview of the historical flow of events.  Way too abstract.

I found the game play boring, devoid of historical flavour and simulation value.  I can forgive the last two factors (I like and play eurogames after all), but can't forgive a game if it is not entertaining.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Victory is determined by earning vps by occupying locations on the map (cities, ports), particularly Paris (5 vps) and Madrid (10 vps) and by picking up Concession cards.  

Concession cards are likely the primary source vps in most games (as it was in our game), with each player receiving secret goal cards dealt out at the beginning of the game that can potentially double the vp value of a Concession.  Concession cards are placed on the board and selected by players in "Will to Fight" order with tie-breaker rules if other players are at the same WF level.

The game uses worker placement with players in turn selecting a single card to place their pawn on.  Players choosing the top located card will become last in the turn order of the next turn. Shouldn't the best card chosen cause a player to become last in turn order instead?  Whatever.

After selecting a card, players can choose to either pay the cost to activate the event and perform no action OR take money equal to the cost of the event and then perform one action.  Events that cost zero money must be activated for the event.  Events can include the placement of Bourbon cubes, Bourbon attacks on player cubes, loss of Barcelona fortifications (game ending event if the fortifications are all destroyed) and so on.

A player is limited to the following actions:  recruit, move, fight, increase level on "Will to Fight" table, and generate revenue.  No player can choose an action that another player has chosen earlier this turn, and no player can choose the same action two turns in a row.  If a player's "Will to Fight" is too low (not at war), they cannot recruit, move or fight until they increase their "Will to Fight" to the minimum level (but can choose the actions:  generate revenue (base of 5 plus 2 money per vp hex occupied) or spend money to increase their "Will to Fight" level.

I find it annoying (plus it makes little thematic sense), that if one player chooses to fight (or recruit/move), no other player can choose to fight (or recruit/move) that turn either.  But that's worker placement for you... or at least how it is implemented in this design.

Movement is hex by hex and costs 1 money per cube, per hex moved, and a cube (up to 2 cubes) can move as far as a player decides to pay (choose move action).  Recruiting cost depends upon where a faction is located on the "Will to Fight" table and will cost a variable amount per cube placed (choose recruit action).  Battles are deterministic, but again costs an amount dependent on a faction's location on the "Will to Fight Table" (choose fight action, and pay money to eliminate an adjacent cube).  

As players are all part of the same alliance, they cannot directly fight each other, but must instead use events and the Bourbon cubes to attack their opponents.  Players can openly negotiate as well (e.g. please choose another card and I will give you money and so on).

That's about it for a turn... choose a card, then pay to activate an event and take no actions OR take money instead and perform one action.  Negotiate if you wish.  A bit dull and limited from a game play pov imo.  This game is about incremental changes which is OK in some games, but can be perceived as boring if not well implemented.  But this is admittedly subjective.

YMMV.

Interesting setting, but mechanically not much happens in the game and not many choices for players each turn. Some of the cards are very powerful, so that's quite a random element, and some are directly bashing the other players making an unsettled mix of eurogame and multiplayer wargame.

In this historical simulation of the early 1700s, players represent the countries trying to conquer the Bourbons in France.  There are five countries: Portugal, Britain, Austria, Dutch and Savoy.  The different mechanic in this game is that you select a card in a certain slot and the position you select the card determines turn order for next turn. The card lets you either collect resources and do an action or pay the resource to use the event in the card.

The countries are asymmetrical. Savoy and Austria cannot use sea movement in the Med until mid game, while Atlantic sea movement is available to the other 3 countries. Savoy and Portugal have only 7 cubes compared to at least 10 cubes to other countries which limits your expansion capabilities. 

The cards do allow for a lot of removing cubes from opponents, taking resources or reducing the will to fight, so I'm not fond of this type of game. I hate dishing it out and receiving it. Having got one game under my belt, I understand how to get your empire expanding, but it was a painful experience for me. I was in a deep hole, and the game went on for 4 hours.  On the bright side, there are one or two different mechanics that are interesting to see but in practice could use some tweaking. Play order is determined by the slot of the card you choose, but sometimes a poor card is put in the first slot, and if you are going last, you could get stuck with it again, forcing you to go last again. In the first round there is no compensation for this. 

It's a combination wargame and Eurogame, so I think it does have a niche. I'm trying not to be too harsh on this game, but it just isn't my type of game.

The board was almost identical four hours after starting, to how we set it up.

I had no real idea what was going on, and yet I won. By sheer luck of having matching concession cards to my starting goals, which were areas I occupied at setup!

Just not my cup of tea all all.

A diplomacy and negotiation game set in the War of the Spanish Succession. Players are the members of the Alliance, fighting against Bourbon forces throughout Europe. But the aim of the players is to obtain the best position (both militarily on the map and diplomatically wit the cards) in order to get the most of the treaties of Utrecht and Rastatt.

So yes, you're allied to the other players, but backstabbing at each turn is the norm...

1714 fits in that awkward place in gaming where it is too historical to be a euro and too abstract to be a wargame - even though it contains elements of both. As a result, I would say that it is not as great as its advocates say it is but it is not as bad as its distractors say it is either. 

I thought it was fun, although it overstays its welcome somewhat. The rules have some issues (mostly a result of translation, it seems) but it is nothing overwhelming or insurmountable. The components are nice and the cards are well done. There is some repetitiveness to the gameplay which is why I say it overstays its welcome. Even with that criticism, it is intriguing to hold my interest while playing.

Overall, a good, but not great, game.

Not sure if this is a wargame, euro, diplomacy variant or politics simulator. Unfortunately neither do the rules and the don't help with much else for that matter.

In terms of explanations, terminology or piece interaction they are a little wanting. Very much in the same camp as 'Sigismundus Augustus' in that respect.

However, at least with SA I understood how stuff worked after a single runthrough. In contrast after playing twice through the step by step example that comes in the 1714 box I'm still none the wiser, stuff happens but seems to relate to nothing in the rules.

Without a full rewrite I don't think it's going to come off the shelf any time soon. Having said that it's definitely a unique experience dealing with a very rare setting in gaming terms.

Unfortunately those that are interested in the war of a Spanish succession will more than likely lean towards 'no peace without Spain' or 'a vacant throne' for their fix.

I certainly want to play this game as it is, from the play throughs I've seen a lot of things I like. Unfortunately I don't know how to achieve any of them.

I will rate this slightly higher than I should with the hope that a relatively higher average may drawmore people to this game and hopefully an idiots guide on how to play.

Just to reiterate, as it stands I would say that sigismundus Augustus has this game beaten in terms of similar recommendations however the potential for this game is high and I hope one day to play a full, successful game or two of this

An interesting period of history. This is part Euro, part CDG. It is not a wargame as combat is very abstracted and simulation isn't really there. It really needs the full 5 player count for optimal experience. It tries to do a lot of things and does some well, but I just wasn't terribly impressed.

This is exactly the type of game I like: historically themed, conflict oriented, asymmetrical, strategic rather than tactical, and highly innovative. But unfortunately 1714 - The Case of the Catalans didn't meet my expectations. It lacked development, smoothness and finish, the map was too big, some of the cards where of different colors for no apparent reason, the rules where somewhat opaque, and the game flow felt slightly static at times, although that could just hinge on our own inexperience. On the other hand, my expectations where set really high. So don't get me wrong, it is not a bad game, far from it, and I would gladly play it again. But...

Full points for originality, history, and the integration of wargame and euro elements. The card/action drafting is the heart of the game, with tough decisions over card events vs resources vs turn order. It takes a while to get your head around the map play, though, and how the abstracted movement and battles work in a system where everyone is vying against one another while fighting the Bourbons.

In the end, it doesn't offer much scope for creativity, and I have my doubts about the re-playability. While the card illustrations and events are evocative, the game doesn't really generate a dramatic narrative. It's also very swingy. I suspect victory will often come down to drawing the right concession at the right time.  I won my first game, and I didn't have any grand strategic design.

This is an interesting game, both from a mechanic and thematic perspective. 

Game mechanics are such that some players can easily find themselves in a position where their options are severely constrained. Part of the challenge of the game is to avoid getting caught in such a situation, mostly by carefully manipulating turn order, Will to Fight (a type of resource/variable in the game that can be highly constraining if it gets low) and resources. Whereas playing well results in a satisfying gaming experience, playing badly can easily result in frustration. Personally I like the challenge, but this is not a game that will be enjoyed by everyone, especially if it is their first go at it.

I found the game play to be immersive and thematically interesting. It covers a part of European history with which I was not familiar with, and playing the game has resulted in me looking up more information about the Spanish War of Succession. 

As many others have pointed out, the rule book is not the best and many questions crop up during game play. Hopefully this is something that will go away after a few plays.

I've now played this enough to feel safe in giving it a rating.  It takes a little getting used to, so if it didn't grab you on your first game, give it another chance.  The rules are not crystal clear and I'm still not sure we're playing 100% correctly, but we're very close, at least!

It's an excellent game, well balanced.  Every country has a chance of winning.  If everyone picks on you, you're not going to win, no.  But if they do, most of them are fools, as they're allowing the one real leader to win.  If you find yourself in a hole, you need to be able to make deals.  We've found bribery doesn't work at our table, but extortion does. "Will you give me a Resource if I make sure this battle and Bourbon relocation doesn't affect you?"  Repeat as needed.

I used to think it was strictly for five players, but we recently played with only three and it was a great game.

Note that we *do* play with a simple variant, found in the Variant section of the Forums (and also as a File) here on BGG.

One play so far, it took much longer than it should have. Beside our unfamiliarity with the rules in general, we missed a crucial detail regarding how the wall comes down. The map didn't change much - was it because it really isn't a wargame, or because we didn't play it like one? It seems we were always running out of resources and will to fight. I love the concept and hope that with a few more plays it will be much smoother and shorter.

Interesting non-cooperative multiplayer game (England, Austria, Holland, Savoy and Portugal should be allied, biut not that much) against the machine (both french and spanish Bourbons).
From a catalan POV it's cruel, but sobering and simply genial: a keystone of our history (Sept 11th, 1714) is just a miserable side scene of the war.

There are major translation errors and omissions which make this game a real chore to play (the rules are terrible). If it was fun we wouldn't mind all that much, but the game is so incredibly boring we couldn't wait for it to end.

There are some clever ideas here, but wonky circumstances and allowed gamey plays just ruin it for us.

Frankly, I don't understand the hype behind this game at all (shilling?) - our group hated the game and will never play it again.

Just a brutal and poor gaming experience beyond description. Very, very disappointed in this one.

There's almost a game here - some of what's happening is interesting and enjoyable. However, there are just too many flaws for my tastes. In no particular order they include: The game is far too long for what it is, and can be dragged out infinitely longer if people fully explore the endless possibilities for extortion and negotiation that the rules allow/encourage. Even this experience isn't consistent - the game begins with clever negotiations but devolves into leader bashing at the mid-way point. Of course, this is flawed, too, as the perceived leader may not have achieved his secret goals, while another player with seemingly lesser board presence may have the game game in the bag with the right goals - there's just no way to tell. The game also can be very frustrating and unforgiving for a player who falls behind and doesn't have the means to change the all-important turn order (players choosing actions last often do nothing on their turns). Finally, the game is confrontational to the point of being capable of causing hard feelings even among fast friends. Ultimately, 1714: The Case of the Catalans is just not worth the time investment required to play.

After 1 5p game - Was sold to the group of players
as a Euro-like war game.   Hmmm.  I guess so.   The mechanic of selecting cards each round with super small text and 5 players around a game board was annoying.   I counter acted this by just alternating between going first and then going last each round in turn order.   

I did like the ship movement and how you could travel very far very soon into the game.

An interesting hybrid style game, along the lines of Imperial.  The mutli-player and negotiation aspects make the game very interesting, and I would definitely play again.  Play actually flows pretty quickly, but players must keep in mind that they will appear to be making very little headway during the game.  I had the distinct impression of rolling a very large boulder up a very steep hill...

As to what I did not like, I think this game suffers from a few flaws, from the simple "gotcha" to the odd design decision.

For one, the biggest (in my view) is perhaps the easiest to get around: this game suffers from a pronounced problem of "the-gamers-REALLY-need-to-know-ALL-of-the-cards" syndrome.  This being my first play as Austria, I was shocked and somewhat dismayed at finding out I could lose ALL of my carefully cultivated Catalonian VPs by being at peace during the [i]mandatory[/i] late game Utrecht treaty.  And this was a mandatory penalty, for [i]only[/i] Austria.  Considering how difficult it is to gain VPs and how few you will end up with, this is an odd balancing mechanism, to be sure (Austria has a lot of forces compared to other powers, so there has to be some mechanism).  This, however is a bit of a surprise if you are unfamiliar with the game.  I would, of course, avoided that strategy from the get go, had I known.  This is not the only example, likely.

An example of an odd design decision is the worker placement style action selection. It feels a little shoe-horned in, as if the designer thought that this would be a good thing to throw in there.  It makes it quite a penalty to attack, since you will likely only clear hexes for somebody else to subsequently move into and claim VPs.  Reminds me a bit of the penalty in Puerto Rico for captaining (always best to let others do the lifting).  The only way to get around this is to hoard cards so that they can be played together, for an attack and move for example. However, since the cards are so very few, it is very obvious who is holding cards to make a push.  In fact, all actions come at a very high cost (for example, I did not make a single attack action all game that was not an Event play), which leads to agonizingly slow progress.  As a result, it is very difficult to not telegraph your intentions, from your secret objectives to your attack intentions, is present in the game.  Difficult to do something without everybody already guessing what you plan.

It also seems like the only really path to victory is to match your concessions to your secret objectives, which can be very much a large degree of luck, if you are behind in the turn order when the cards come up (although there are mechanisms to correct if you miss one of your objective concessions.  Pay attention to them, but again, your opponents will realize what you are doing.)  As a result, even though it appears you can do any different things, there is really only one solid path to victory.

Even so, it is a very interesting game, if the players are familiar with the "gotchas" and if you have a firm grasp on what you need to actually be doing, as opposed to what you can do.  This is just one of those games that fools you into thinking you have lots of options, when you really don't.  Also, it is one of the games that looks like a wargame on the surface (like Imperial) that does not reward playing it as if it were a wargame (again, like Imperial).  The action selection mechanism leads to a lot of "screw your neighbor"  moments, and the amount of negotiating (anything in the game can be negotiated) is perfect.  If you like that sort of thing, you will love 1714.  Just don't play it like a wargame and you'll do fine.

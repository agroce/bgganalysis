RATING: 7
Cooperative dungeon explorer with a great emphasis on the unknown and the random as the dungeon is revealed tile by tile as you play...
3rd of the D&D Board Game...

-1 For weird mechanic that make a specific hero 'own' a specific monster. Can be confusing at time, when 2 or 3 monsters of the same type are in play at the same time...
-1 Because some thing are not well explained, like which dungeon tiles are considered standard and which are considered specific to an Adventure... Hint: Read each Adventures and remove tiles with a specific name, these are Special Adventure tiles...
-1 Because a lot of Adventures require to have a dungeon already build (granted, randomly) at the start of the game, removing the fun of discovering the dungeon as you play...

Got for $30 at Games Unlimited, great deal!  Even convinced my brother to play and he had a good time.  Looking forward to playing this one more, and possibly integrating it with the other two (when I get them eventually).

I've had more fun playing these boardgames ~3 times than playing DnD 4E for like 3 years.  This is the pacing that system needs--not 2+ hour combats.

Finally someone made a Drizzt game!  My favorite of the 3 because of the characters.

Perfect blend of co-op, dungeon crawling, time, and problem solving.  Super fun.  Incredible production value.  Improvement on Castle Ravenloft.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Even though I don't consider these games to be tactical combat games, I really like the new hero abilities that give more tactical options.  I love having the ability to get the drop on a monster now, or move out of the way to avoid an attack.  I'm curious to try these heroes in the other 2 games, because they seem super retard strong compared to the other heroes in CR.

Fun, fast, dungeon-crawling co-op.  Tactical rather than strategic with some simple choices along the way.  Great components and miniatures as well.  Makes a change from the regular co-ops.

Wife was surprised how much she loved these D&D games. Nothing deep about them, but its just fun to roll some dice and kill some monsters sometimes. Great for when you don't want to have to think too hard, but you want something more substantial than a little filler.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Good game , but missed opportunity to make this game great. Artwork is the worst part of this game. So simple with the lore of Drizzt being so big and so much they could have done. Game itself is not challenging enough. Own it because I am a Drizzt fan and not beacause of the boardgame itself.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a classic, scenario based dungeoncrawler, where you just move and kill, or kill and move your way through a randomly built dungeon. The rules are simple and fun, but the game is quite tough enough, so this gives it a lot of replayability. The fantasy theme is based on the Dungeons&Dragons universe. The problem with it, that it has only a few scenarios.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Enjoy the coop and solo aspect of game.

1st play: An interesting dungeon crawler. The tile art was pretty bland but the system was fun. It didn't feel like most co-ops, where you're just racing against a deck, even tho that was happening. The theme was strong, and there was lots of treasure. A decent game.

2nd play: Technically we played Drizzt, but it's the same system with different map and heros. I enjoyed myself playing this, and if I end up seeing one of the games for cheap, I'll pick it up, even if only for the minis in the box. One of my favorite co-ops - a short list.

Updated 12/13/15: Playing with Wife and 7 year old is rough, as I end up moving all the monsters for them and telling them all the rolls.  The minis look great and the game is just the right amount of difficulty.

I'm big into D&D, but for some reason, these games are just ok for me.  Maybe I haven't played with the right group.  I'll never get rid of this, however, even thought the box is huge.  The minis alone are too cool to give up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A light dungeon crawl experience with a few quirks that make it somewhat annoying... Can be a fun game when it's what you're in the mood for, but they really didn't do enough with what you get in the box here. It looks like a dungeon crawling feast, but it's mostlt just okay. Better for youngsters.

Nice dungeoncrawl, but I'm a bit dissapointed AT the miniatures. Not the best of detail. 

I have to say that this game is growing on me. Thought I would get tired of the simple mechanics pretty fast but that has proven wrong. 
Perfect two player game. The scenarios are somewhat different and they need some planning to complete. We play with the level up rules from Ninjadog which is a nice little addition to the base game. 
If you like dungeon crawlers and a easy to understand ruleset this is a perfect little uncomplicated game.

Instead of playing this game, why not pull a lever and watch a banner falling: YOU WIN! If u know to speculate all the rules and you play optimal, you need something to made this game harder... is not Ok to lower more and more the difficulty of D&D Adventure games Wotc.. is simply to make a lever that once pulled u win and sell this :P 

Played the first 3 adventures and i like it. Is an interesting feeling to play solo :) Yay! Played in 2-5 players and is a good experience. In 2 games was easy to win even without using healing surges, and 1 game was at a single hit close to loose using all stuff available. I`ll look for the custom stuff to get more flavor of this wonderful universe, and i hope for new and more developed RPG things: more levels, and deeper mechanics in the new D&D Adventure Games thaw will come. Until now i think is an evolution and worth to be the 3rd of his kind :)

/Impressions after 5 games played: the game is just too easy, heroes are overpowered (Wulfgar can beat a boss in a single turn.. did 8 damage with an item of double attack), monsters are gentle and don`t do much damage, encounters and traps are sweet in comparison with Castle Ravenloft.It add 8 good heroes and some variety, so don`t buy it alone.. it need Castle Ravenloft if u want a struggle...

/after 9 games 9/9 win (different scenarios)
- last one was a very hard win in 2 players with boosted level 1-3 monsters.. superbe experience 
TESTED Hard Mode with Errtu as final boss was a very strong struggle!

HOW TO RISE THE DIFFICULTY OF THE GAME:
Blessed by the evil Goddess Lolth the Demon Queen of Spiders the monsters in LoD receive some bonus attributes to offer more spectacular fights and please their leader as follows:

Hard Boosted Mode
 - all level 1-3 exp. monsters: +1 AC and +1 life
(place life tokens on their cards too accordingly) 

Very Hard Boosted Mode
 - all level 1-3 exp. monsters: +1 AC and +1 life, and in plus: 
 - Spider Swarm: +1 attack, Damage: (+)1 and poisoned (Queen's favorites no? :P )
 - Goblin Champion: +1 attack, +1 Damage
 - Goblin Archer: if adjacent to a hero he attack with an arrow for +3 attack,->Damage 1
and inspired by goddess he never cower in fear 

/after 13 normal games: 12 won/1 lost 
Conclusion: play normal games with normal heroes that do 1 damage/turn for a balanced game

/after 7 boosted games: 4 won/3 lost
Conclusion: play boosted games with the overpowered heroes that can do 2 or more damage/turn

Although comparing the encounters and monsters to the other sets, LoD's encounters and monsters aren't that much challenging. Good Game :)

Much the same system as Castle Ravenloft, the difference here is that the plastic miniatures are even better (especially the Balor) and you are using named characters from the R.A. Salvatore Forgotten Realms novels like Catti-Brie, Wulfgar, Athrogate, Jarlaxle and of course Drizzt himself. Wish there was more art on the item cards but that's my only aesthetic beef with this. Fun game, and you can cross it over with Ravenloft, Ashardalon and the conversion cards/figures from the Dungeon Command series.

This game is pretty fun if you have a group that can immerse themselves into the lore and gameplay of it all. Other than that, it doesn't really hold true to the D&D world with the customization. The weapons, dailies, utilities, and at-wills are all stale in comparison to other dungeon crawling games where they can customize weapons. The only die that you roll is the hit-die. Damage is constantly the same. It's not a bad game; don't get me wrong. There are just multiple things that can be improved.

I've only played this game about 4 times since I bought it due to the large amount of time for setup and rules explanation. There is so much potential in this box and I can't wait to get to the latter missions. Not to mention how awesome it is to add my Blood of Gruumsh figures into the mix! Having a giant, beautifully colored owlbear appear from out of the dark caverns is true terror!

The D&D Adventure Series of modular tactical miniature games are great gateways to bring video gamers or RPG gamers into the board game hobby. They're a lot of fun, despite not offering quite as much in the way of strategy and storytelling as some other adventure games. [b]Legend of Drizzt[/b] is the third installment and the most fully-developed of the three games. It has unique elements that often make it the most appealing of the series. A must-have for fans of the R.A.Salvatore Forgotten Realms novels, as you get to play the Companions of the Hall and face all of their notable enemies!

A few improvements over Wrath of Ashardalon and Castle Ravenloft but the Villains are kind of meh. We have exciting quests, great new monsters (epic Trolls!) and heroes designed for breaking of the repetitive exploration system. The new STANCE abilities are really great.

Now we need better hero development and a campaign system and we have a rating of 9-10.

Good third installment! Too easy though because of overpowered heroes.

The best of the bunch of D&D Adventure games, so far. The monsters are super tough, but the characters (especially Drizzt, WOW!) are also powered up. As a fan of the books, this is just spot on.

I own all three D&D co-ops and this is definitely the best and most playable entry in the trilogy. 

It manages to simplify the up keep (no lasting environmental effects, simplified curses, less treasure items), while also giving you more interesting decisions (stances). I also think they really nailed the encounter deck. The traps are more interesting and there are generally more interesting decisions to be made.
To enjoy this game you do need to up the difficulty. I simply swapped a couple of week creatures for tougher creatures from Ravenloft but there are a lot of ways to make it more challenging. 
Most co-ops feel abstract but this one is really concrete. This is a really unique and fun game series.

Although they both share the same rulesystem, The Legend of Drizzt plays slightly better than Castle Ravenloft: small adjustments have been made to its rules that in the end greatly improve the game, although basically they still are the same and, most relevantly, still feel way too dry and meaningless, just a mechanical device to exploit D&D pointless system and powers in a more suitable way than the RPG failure they had been conceived for.

Adds in some interesting features (like stances) to an already pretty decent system.  I still struggle with the basic mechanic of the D&D box games, where exploration uncovers monsters that always get the first hit in.  Success in these games seems to be based more on surviving attrition than coming up with a strategy to win.

The more I play this, the more I dislike it. Great components. Elegant system with very few rules. Actual play is grindy/mechanical and lacking in flavour.

Very good game. One of the best Dungeoncralws out there, especially if you combine the different D&D Adventure games. You´ll then end up with tons of heroes, monsters, treasures and events. Wonderful minis and components. I wish the exploration factor and the tiles had a little more effect on the game. The game could have a lot more atmosphere if not for the lack of artwork on the cards and the tiles. They missed an opportunity here. It could have been the greatest Dungeoncrawl out there...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Clearly the best of the three. 
Better and iconic characters, greater variety of npcs and of the quests' structure, highly thematic!
The quest variation might make you like it even if you didn't like the system so far! Still no campaign play, although the events the quests represent are from different "time periods" according to the "official Drizzt lore", so probably it would feel awkward to link them up. 
Absolutely recommended for fans of Drizzt Do' Urden!

While the miniatures are cool and I like the co-op, the game never felt like major exploration - never went 'deep' into the dungeon, seems like the bosses are hanging around the entrance, just need to wait a bit. Very repetitive. 

For rolling dice with miniatures and fighting (or evading) I'd rather spend the same time playing Earth reborn.

I've played this one solo with just one hero so far. The sequence of play can get a little repetitive but I am enjoying the game anyway. Like many others I wish this was more RPG lite in the sense of leveling or being a little less predictable about what will happen on a given tile. After playing a bit more I will check out the use made variants and see what they add.

Co-op monster slaying dungeon crawl. The event cards are a soft timer, slowly pecking away at the health of the party. It's a rush to the end with no time to loiter. Tactics and spatial positioning is mostly irrelevant due to the way monsters move and attack. Works better with more players; if playing two player experiment with controlling two heroes each or adding in NPCs using the ally cards.

Fun co-op dungeon crawl that doesn't need a DM or Dark Overlord. Pity the dungeon crawling is so predictable (draw monster and/or encounter card every tile). Very ripe for own modifications to make it a true dungeon crawler.

I'm a eurogamer, but I do like a few non-eurogames like Summoner Wars, Survive! and Escape among other games. I had seen a lot of video reviews about The Legend of Drizzt before I pulled the trigger, because I wanted to be sure it was something for me. 
It did seem like a good game when I read the rules, but once we played it, it just didn't feel that spectacular. Not a whole lof of important strategic og tactical decisions, not much to do on your turn, and the end-game was a bit anticlimactic. 

I thought I would enjoy it but it fell flat. I am definitely willing to try again with different scenarios and with a different group of players (though I played with the group I definitely think would like it the most, and they were also a bit "meh"), but the game confirmed what I already knew; I'm just not into ameritrash.

Cool game series! I'm happy to play, though there are a few hiccups. First, it needs a very strong campaign mode. Second, it's a little annoying that when you encounter critters, they almost always attack first. There's got to be a better mechanism.

This was the most mechanically solid version of the D&D adventure games, but not being very interested in Drizzt, I didn't find the theme terribly appealing.

RATING: 9
Once you get the hang of the order of play, these games go fast, the dungeons grow visibly quickly and they allow for some light role play, but you can still eat a meal on the side.  Great with kids (5th grade and up).   

I love the bonus adventure that combines Wrath of Ashardalon with Castle Ravenloft -- I wonder when the bonus adventure that combines Legend of Drizzt with one or both of the other two will be published?

Only reason this is not a 10 is that I know there's some room for additional awesomeness in later iterations as more special tiles are added etc.

I enjoyed this D&D board game better than the first two, because of  the Heroes and Monsters.  Drizzt offers many new heroes AND they are all ones I want to play as.  The monsters range from easy to Feral Troll!

Castle Ravenloft has basic heroes, a lot of 1 HP monsters and I loved the vampire castle/classic horror theme.  

Ashardalon has different heroes, chamber tiles, doors and slightly more complex monsters.

Straightforward dungeon crawl - solid fun with no fuss.  A nice set of scenarios, plus so much in the box to just make up your own set ups - plenty of replayability here.  Nice in that it's fully co-op so a table of friends going up against the dungeon makes for a good evening.  Would like to try the other 2 in the series.

Only played a few times, and just the first few scenarios. But even then, the purity and simplicity of the gameplay are delightful, and very much a good bit of storytelling, even though the cards themselves have little text and are pretty barebones in the descriptions. But the cinematic feel of the game, as that Feral Troll spawns right around the corner, is excellent. I look forward to delving deeper in the Underdark....

Seems like a small improvement over the previous two games which were excellent as well. Definitely worth getting if you're a fan. The heroes seem a lot stronger in this game but so are the monsters. The dungeon tiles are much nicer and the treasure deck is not quite as overpowered as it was in Ashardalon and not quite as weak as it was in Ravenloft. Drizzt still is easiest of the three games, mostly because of the stronger heroes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Fantantic rules...very short and well written.  You can pick it up and being playing very quickly.  The action keeps moving, but it was manageable.  The monsters pass through the game quickly, and the treasure keep the game from getting boring.  Treasure cards keep you deep in options for your turn.  I need to play more scenarios before I give a complete review, but it looks like a solid game that will give a lot of replay value.  

Update...after another play, I'm not too impressed with the characters available.  I like the idea of allies, but I like the character power cards much better in Ravenloft and Ashardalon.

Got it as a Co-Op game to try with my wife, but I have only played solo so far. All the games I played solo before bored me a few turns in. However, this has kept me wnating to play more and more.

RATING: 8
This is a fun dungeon crawler with impressive miniatures and major replayability:  There are a bunch of different heroes to choose -- each with a many powers to select from; there are plenty of scenarios, traps, monsters, and villains, etc. I also really like how there's no need for a DM; every monster follows if-then-else tactics when attacking.

On the down side:  It can be a bit tough -- the game is always coming at you full bore, and there are hardly any means of healing. The dungeon tiles are really lacking in detail (look at Descent's tiles for how the tiles should look), and I don't care much for the simplistic art direction. Also, the rulebook definitely doesn't cover all the necessary "if", "ands" and "buts".
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The first board game to get me into modern board games. Settlers of Catan, Munchkin, and 7 Wonders were all good games at the time (7 Wonders still is, the other two...not so much), but this game with its miniatures, d20, tiles, and cards reminded me of Dragon Strike the board game I had as an older kid. This is the game that made me look online to see what else was out there.

The game play is pretty straightforward but is complex enough to be difficult for non gamers. The tactics are interesting enough and the game shines as a cooperative game. Haven't gotten a chance to try the competitive scenarios much. Replayability may suffer over time once all the scenarios and characters have been seen but there is enough in the box to be worthwhile and you can always customize scenarios.

Somewhat easier than Castle Ravenloft, due to more powerful characters, but very fun, nonetheless. It has fast setup time, and simple rules that don't detract from the game itself. Add the possibility of combining it with other D&D Adventure System games, as well as monsters from Dungeon Command, and you have a game with incredible replay value.

Giving this 7 after one solo play.
I can see this rating going both ways after playing again, and with more players.

More players will surely make the encounter cards better and give more strategy to the game.
"Come over here and help me!"
"You stall the troll, while I check out this corridor."

Solo it seems a bit random. Sure there are choices, but mostly Move - Explore - Kill - Move.
Still, I'm looking forward to try this one more time solo.

Comes with a ton of minituares; That's nice.

Another fun D&D game, and plays the same. This one has the best board tiles, giving great variation to dungeon shapes. The monsters are quirkier this time, and though bizarrely colored they look fun on the table. The theming is pretty strong and, like the monster tactics, the heroes are also quirkier. I assume to better approximate their literary characterizations, the heroes usually have 2 predetermined powers, but instead of feeling limiting it gives the heroes more satisfying individuality. I dig having the variety of monsters from all 3 games, and already I'm mixing them all up in one huge smorgasbord of deadliness. I'm so glad there's a troll in this one since that was one of the classics missing in Wrath of Ashardalon.

The gameplay itself is fairly good. Easy to pickup and remember, it's also fairly fast to play one your used to it. The game puts a little too much emphasis on forcing you to explore every turn reducing the ability to make tactical plays. It can benefit greatly from a few house rules. 

The major failing is the story connected to the adventure. Each adventure only has a couple of sentences of blurb text and few, if any, feel like they have a purpose. This may be due to it being based off the book and reading the book may give it more context. Characters also have very little background.

It does have a lot of potential for player designed expansion and customisation.

I still don't like the system of "whenever you explore a tile a monster attacks you. if you don't explore something bad happens. even if you do explore something bad probably happens". It seems like I spend way too much time making the game system work and not much time getting to do stuff on my own initiative.

Traded with a friend, my daughter really enjoyed it.  I found it fairly boring and repetitive.  Giving it back soon.  Other than the "artificial" difficulty of randomness (dice and encounters), the game wasn't really deep or heavy in theme, imo.  And I'm a huge fan of the Drizzt/Drow novels.  My daughter (age 7) loved it for it's simplistic gameplay.  It wasn't too much for her to digest or follow.  For those reasons, and those reasons only, I enjoyed the sessions I played with her.  (And the only reason I give it a 6 instead of a 5)

Okay, I'm a huge fan of D&D 3.5 edition, despite its many flaws ... D&D 5e has returned to its roots while 4e was utter failure, in my opinion. That said, the D&D board games are [i]exactly[/i] what 4e should've been all along!

I've always loved the Dungeons & Dragons board games. They bring flavor and dungeon crawling to the table in an easily digestible package. For a while, however, they ended up taking the back seat to other games in my collection (or on my wish list) since I did not get to play them as often as I would like. But then I started playing these games more and more with my kids and their glory returned to the table once more!

These games are interesting, challenging, and captivating, whether you win or lose. This particular game is probably my favorite of the original three!

Bought Castle Ravenloft and loved it. Wrath of Ashardalon equally so. I don't know what happened with this game. Was it so simple to strap on the annoying little Drow's name and call it a day. It's not really compatible with the first two, the players are too obtuse. Players are more powerful than before, while the monsters are neutered. One of the monsters literally says it cowers in fear if you get adjacent, while there are encounter cards that say no encounter. I bought this from a friend who ran a game shop. He played it with us as he was a fan of the earlier games. After about an hour where no one took damage or it was healed almost instantly, he asked me if I wanted my money back. This game is rated higher than the previous games, presumably because of the atrocious name attached to it. If you want absolutely no challenge and a boring cake walk play this game, otherwise go play one of the first two. Their gameplay is vastly superior.

Epic adventure each time you play it. The miniatures and the cavern tiles really put you into the story. It's fun and somewhat fast. The downside is that it is a game of luck, the dice is important and maybe the only strategy. It can be frustrating to roll the dice and get low numbers each time. But it´s a good experience and I'm happy to have it.

RATING: 5
Fast-paced, simplistic dungeon crawl, but in this case, somewhat too simplistic. Strategy is usually transparent, and tactics are limited, especially after "daily powers" are used. I like the ability to select some of the character's powers (daily, utility powers). Even so, the options are often still limited. Additionally, the lack of depth in monster cards is disappointing - unless combined with other games. Furthermore, the Stance Tokens that appear in this game are poorly presented, confusing and not explained in the rules, the company on-line tutorial or any official FAQ that I can find. As stated in the BGG rules forum for this game, an argument can be made for turning over the card (inactivating it) after use and not turning over the card. On the other hand, theme and presentation are nice. Overall, the game system lacks substance and is limited to light play. The game, however, does fill that niche fairly well.

This is a tremendously fun instalment in this series of games.  I like all the new heroes and the Cavern Tiles that have unique conditions makes the crawl more dynamic than in Ravenloft.  So, far I've only done a couple of the adventures, but I'm sure the others will find nice ways to twist the gameplay to make every play a new one.  This is a fantastic interpretable system and every time I find a situation where I'm not sure what the rule would be, it's something of a relief to not even bother looking it up (because by now we know the ruling won't be in there) and just decide how it should be handled yourself.

Otthon – Száműzött – Menedék, tovább is van mondjam még …
A lapkafelfedezős-mászkáló-szörnygyakós játék alapját a fantasy rajongók körében méltán népszerű Sötét elf-trilógia képezi (a játék ezen könyvek elolvasása nélkül is élvezhető, azonban a könyvek ismerete még többet tesz a játékélményhez). Az alapfelállás egyszerű, a kalandfüzet vonatkozó részének megfelelően előkészítjük az adott játékot, kiválasztjuk kalandorainkat és nekilátunk a pálya felderítésének. A játék egyik nagy előnye az egyszerű, könnyen megérthető szabályrendszer, amelyben minden játékosnak a körében 3 fázis van. Mozog/támad a hős. Utána felfedezi a következő helyszínt (opcionális – azonban, ha nem hajtod végre mindenképpen találkozás kártyát húzol, ami a legtöbb esetben nem jó dolog) és végrehajt egy találkozást (encounter – opcionális a felfedezéstől vagy annak végre nem hajtásától függően), majd aktiválódnak a szörnyek (nincs külön játékos, aki a gonosz oldalt irányítja ). A játékhoz szükséges még 20 oldalú dobókocka is, ebből következik, hogy a szerencsefaktor itt is jelen van. Egy-egy küldetést gyorsan tudnak játékosaink teljesíteni, így ez a játék remek belépő szintű társas lehet a fantasy jellegű „dungeon crawler” társasok iránt érdeklődők részére. Ajánlom kipróbálásra.

RATING: 3
Put quite a bit of time in to the game, but ultimately got relatively little enjoyment out of it. Whole thing feels too simple as a game, and while I get the references to the books this takes its missions from, I never really got the feel of the theme through the game... paste any generic fantasy theme over it, and it plays exactly the same (as the other D&D games in this series probably prove, though I'd not choose to try out any of the others).

RATING: 7
Same system as castle ravenloft and ashardalon, so see comments on those games.  Despite being a fan of the book, I did not enjoy this as much as Ashardalon.  It is cool to see all the drizzt people in the game, and playing through the entire set of scenarios would probably be a great rehash of the books.  As always the miniatures are gorgeous, the card text clear and unambiguous, and the rules system very tight.  I know they were sticking to the drizzt story, but not having a wizard in the group just seemed wrong.  We had one player who wanted to play a wizard (I mean this is a D&D game) but got to play regis instead.  This isn't really a criticism of the game, but more of a way to point out that Drizzt might not be the right game in the series for every game group.  

One bonus is that the game contains an "advanced" deck which has different powers and monsters and probably gives Drizzt additional replayability in comparison to the other games in the series.

I would recommend this to anyone who loved Ravenloft and Ashardalon and wants more, or to anyone who doesn't own either of those two games, enjoys light cooperative dungeon crawls, and is a fan of the drizzt books.  If you aren't a fan of the drizzt books, I think ashardalon is a better choice since it more accurately captures the generic high fantasy feel.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Having only played a scenario in each, I really can't comment on which of the D&D board games is better other than to say that dragons are obviously cooler than vampires or Drizzt. These D&D board games function as a very stripped-down version of a D&D dungeon crawl (devoid of any real role-playing). I find Descent to be a much more enjoyable experience as I think the presence of a player Overlord and the increased tactical options add a lot. However, the game length obviously suffers for it, so this is a game you can play a lot faster than Descent.

Each player gets a hero, makes some choices about starting skills and abilities, and heads into the dungeon to start exploring. Tiles are revealed from the stack, each containing a monster with its own scripted AI that it follows (generally running towards the nearest hero and trying to kill it). Combat is handled with a single roll of the d20, compared to the armor class of the target, damage value reduces target's hit points, end of turn. Each player also controls some monsters that move at the end of their turns, mainly following the AI script, but with a few player choices as well. Each game is scenario-based, so the goals and tile layouts will be a little different each time, often even within the same scenario. Working together, the players will find treasure, kill monsters, and hopefully save the day. 

The components are a mixed bag. It's an enormous box, chock-full of tiles, tokens, and plastic. However, the cards themselves, while of high quality, are very bland to look at. When you find a sword, you don't get to see a picture of it (despite the publisher's extensive library of D&D artwork they could have easily used), you get to see a bunch of text. Similarly, the plastic figures are provided unpainted, despite the fact that the publisher also manufactures painted versions. Players wanting to replace their unpainted versions with painted ones by tracking down single D&D Minis will often be halted by the high prices of some of the rarer ones. Even if it was cost prohibitive to provide these in the base game, the publisher certainly had the ability to offer a full set of painted minis separately, which would have helped out its consumers significantly. The game really comes alive using the painted minis. 

I am someone who often doesn't like co-operative games. I see them as nothing more than a group optimization puzzle, or in some cases sheer randomness with only an illusion of control. Because of this, they either lose their flavor once "solved", or simply feel like a pointless waste of time. But these games really are my favorite co-ops ever because they avoid these pitfalls. Yes it is possible to get better at the game, but this is mainly by knowing the monsters and items. And yes, randomness will determine a lot of your success or failure. But because the theme and story are so important, you don't really mind this. Ultimately, this is what D&D is all about: story over gameplay. It really works well here. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game is simply fun!  Everyone in our group has played D&D at one point or another, so the game wasn't too complicated for us.  We actually appreciated that it was a self-contained, streamlined D&D adventure.  For those times when you don't have a dedicated group or even a Dungeon Master to walk you through the reins, this game's deck system and automation work really well.

A bevy of heroes and situations to choose from, the game seems to offer a great deal of replay.  Mostly cooperative, the game also has some head to head scenarios - which will prove to be interesting on future plays.

Great dungeon crawler fun, especially for fans of the Salvatore series. Quality miniatures and components.

I'm a bit puzzled by this game. On a component only point of view this game totaly rocks! It would deserve a 10! Miniatures... lots of miniatures! and then: robust, well-made tiles, millions of different tokens, cards, a 20-sided die...
On a gameplay point of view, though... I find it a bit lacking. The rules are...meh... Everything is a little on the light side. BUT, it can be fun at times. It is totally playable solo, and the randomness of the game system grants a lot of replayability and variety. I will tentatively rate it a 7.5... I will come back to edit my rating after more plays.

While I can appreciate what the designers are trying to do with this game, it suffers on so many levels that I refuse to play this ever again. Plenty of cool bits and fairly decent combat system, but that's it.

It is yet another attempt at a dungeon crawl game, trying to capture the classic feel of Dungeons and Dragons, without the need for a referee. The game rules have built in a certain amount of "intelligence" (more like guidelines) on how the monsters/traps/events operate in the dungeon.

From what I've been told, combat is a very simplified D20 system from AD&D 4th edition. Having never played a D20 system, admittedly, it is a very clean and straightforward implementation, which is a lot better than others that I have seen (e.g., Doom, Dungeon Quest, Talisman, Runebound, and Prophecy). Monsters and player characters have an Armor Class, which is a "To Hit" number on a D20. However, this number can be modified by the attacker's abilities. Monsters have 1/2/3 hit points at most, and damage is usually fixed at 1 or 2 points per hit.

While the concept of Armor Class has always baffled and annoyed me (i.e., armor absorbs damage, it should not have anything to do with your ability to get hit), at least this D20 system manages to abstractly represent the skills/abilities/stance of the attacker and the skills/abilities/stance/armor of the defender, and by adding the two, it represents it as a single number. However, it is by no means anything close to the complexity and realism of Magic Realm's combat system, but that is not a bad thing when taken into account the context of the overall game.

Unfortunately, this simplicity is convoluted by a menu of steps that each player must take, since they must control both their character, as well as manage the actions of the monsters or other elements of the dungeon. In a six player game, downtime was a good ten minutes between turns, and my turn lasted about 30 seconds due to my trivial choices. The payoff for the time invested is simply not worth it.

Since the game runs on automatic, with random treasure/events/monsters, each dealt out from their own deck, this is a rather glorified version of Munchkin, and possibly cleaner implementation of Dungeon Quest. Since everything is random, there is no story line, plot, or objective. All one does is wander around exploring, encountering and killing monsters, springing traps, while simply trying to survive while the game tries to kill you. Some may call that an adventure, but having played my share of RPGs, the sterility and blandness is all too apparent.

After spending a boring hour, all six players agreed to stop--this included two veteran AD&D players. Most of that time was spent flipping through the rule book to discern the "intelligence" of the game. While it is agreed that with experience, the game should flow more smoothly and quickly, there is nothing interesting to examine here. This would have been an incredible game 30-40 years ago, when D&D was just starting out, but now I'd rather have a computer take care of the administrative stuff. I rate it a '2'.

I love the way the box art evokes '70s pulp fantasy—the lurid, blacklight colors, the hero surging ferociously forward as his foes fall fatally felled.  Even the title font is reminiscent of an acid rock album cover.

The game pretty much hits all those marks—psychedelic and muscular, you cleave through masses of enemies, giving each of them a gullet-loosening taste of steel or a marrow-roasting blast of black magic.  And the whole time the axes wail with soul-blistering guitar solos that propel you forward into the arms of either an appropriately outsized sex object or Death Itself...

Also, few things are as satsifying as dual-wielding a hapless goblin to death who was probably doing nothing more than innocently poking his head out his front door to see what all the ruckus was about.

It's a good game and enjoyable for a light weight dungeon hack that still manages to give you the feel as an introduction to D&D. I've had a good time in my games. Its approach to dungeon building and to monster AI are enjoyable and create a random bit of dungeon delving joy.

Where it falls short is with the rather limited character development (also a bonus if you are wanting a less complex D&D game) and with any sort of pacing or tactical choice. Because of the way the mechanics work, delaying and waiting to position, event cards are likely to trigger and cause you damage. Any pace but 'Leroy Jenkins' makes your life more in peril. This is the largest reason that my gaming group is less likely to play it.

My family and I like this game. It is simple enough that all of my children 7 and up can play it (but some are too young and do not fully understand how to play effectively). The AI is really done well. It always feels like a real challenge when we win the game, and when we lose we were reasonably close to the goal. A few times we had given up on winning, and to our surprise end up winning do to some luck, lol. We also bought Castle Ravenloft with this, and combine the pieces. I think that the extra characters and character abilities is great, and helps you customize your play style. I love how the AI does not interrupt the game flow. It is not rated higher because there are other games we wold rather play due to no fault of D&D

This is more of the same in the series.  There are a few tweaks, but nothing major.  If you liked the other games in the series, then you'll like this one.  If you haven't played any of them yet, then you probably don't need to spend much time comparing them.  Just grab one and go.

So far quite OK. It doesn't feel like there's a lot of story here, necessarily, but the game is fun all the same. Of course, the game is extremely focused on combat, but unlike say, Mice & Mystics, combat here is at least mercifully fast and short.

The components are disappointing. Drab, boring map tiles, cards with little or no illustrations on them, etc.

For now, we are having a good time, but I predict that the game's charms will fade at some point...

Initial Rating: 7.0 (February 2013)

I wasn’t expecting much from the game, but I was pleasantly surprised. I really liked it. The miniatures are AWESOME, I want to buy the game just for that. The rules are easy to grasp and the game can be a challenge to beat. As I have been a fan of D&D all my life, I found the theme to be brilliant. The components are high quality in general, although I found the cards are thin and can be damaged easily.  

The game is not deep, but it is pretty fun to play. As the game is so simple, I’m worried that it can get repetitive very soon, but right now I want to play all the scenarios and perhaps check the other two games (Castle Ravenloft and Wrath of Ashardalon).

Good (light RPG) Co-Op game, I want to play again soon.

One of 2011´s favorites.

RATING: 8
[b]I love it. Played over 30 times per half year.

I always use few house rules, because we like more realistic games and we played D&D from books:[/b]
 
1. Most important from D&D: Attack of opportunity - Whenever hero move or make range attack adjacent monster can attack him.
1.2 "Shift" or Side-step:   shifting in D&D 4 not provoke Opportunity Attacks
1.5  Enemy units move (to nearest Hero) and do not "teleport" from mushrooms to mushrooms
2. Level ups up to 5 lv. (You can find it on google/BGG for this game)
3. Hero can take Treasure from died monster on 50% success: roll d20 >= 10. This actions cost 1 movement value. Also sometimes we pay, if you draw "instant" treasure card, you can try to convert to "Sroll"(one time use spell)  - roll again on 50% success: roll d20 >= 10 you convert it to sroll and you can use it later.
4. Critical Miss from D&D: whenever hero/monster roll natural "1": he roll again, but attack him self. (If it was range attack, attack other friendly hero)
5. and others from D&D:
 att bonus +1, if you run 3 spaces directly strait in enemy; 
+2  att bonus if your heroes flanking enemy; 
additional movement  cost on mushroom spaces;

The Legend of Drizzt is a smooth, accessible, and enjoyable fantasy adventure game. While it is admittedly on the light side for those who are seasoned D&D players, it offers enough substance and theme for an engaging experience. It is easy to learn and plays quickly. This is a strength for the most part, although I find myself wanting a little more complexity. The fact that all players experience the game equally (i.e., no need for a DM) is a plus for me as the guy who is usually the DM. The Legend of Drizzt isn't meant to be a full RPG so several key elements are missing, but it does scratch the itch nicely. It can also serve as a great source of tiles and miniatures for real D&D sessions.

(We play with a couple of minor house rules: We only draw Encounter Cards for Cavern Tiles with white triangles when we roll an 11-20, and we only draw Treasure Cards when we defeat a humanoid creature. We find these changes to be more thematic without impacting the balance of the game.)

[Edit: dropped rating as this lost its flair after the first 6 adventures.]

Probably as good as Ravenloft. Bought this used very cheap and haven't gotten it to the table yet, but the scenarios look very interesting and new heroes is always welcome.

Unbelievable components, this is a 10 just for the bits.  I was interested in getting either Ravenloft or Ashardalon, but when Drizzt was announced I was very happy to wait for that one - I've read most of the books so it scores well with me for that.  Quick and stream-lined for play with the kids.

RATING: 6
I was disappointed that the game does not seem to offer enough choices. You move, get a new monster, and a bad encounter. If you beat the monster you get a treasure. The fighting is just done by selecting a card for an attack bonus and rolling a 20 sided die. You have some minor choices in using your attack cards, but most of the time you will reuse your favorite at-will attack. The best part of the game is that the pieces look nice. We barely lost our game, but I think it just ended up being the luck from the die rolls and the dungeon tile and card draws. For example the end game activation tile ended up coming out last. It was pushed back by one card and the random setup made it the last of four tiles. I would rather play Castle Panic.

Comparatively simple and quick cooperative dungeon romp that works but doesn't offer anything innovative and gets repetitive fast. Turn after turn, you move, whack some monster, explore and the next monster shows up. After playing two scenarios, I don't have the feeling that there's much more to discover unless you start expanding the rules to create a game up to your liking which is not what I'm looking for in a boardgame. For a eurogamer without any background in D&D who isn't going nuts for the really huge miniatures, there's not enough game beneath the thematic surface.
From the D&D boardgame series I only played this one, so no comment on its merits relative to the other releases. But I suppose that they offer more of the same instead of something different which is fine if you enjoy them but doesn't give me any incentive to seek them out.

RATING: 7
A game with much potential but misses the target when it comes to gameplay. Lets start with the game's strengths, first off this is a fantastic looking game with outstanding and varied miniatures. There is more than sufficient variety in how each enemy plays to keep it interesting from that perspective. The tile placement mechanism for laying out the dungeon works well and does generate a genuine feel of exploration. The heroes are well balanced and each have their own feel and the general presentation is very good.

However, great miniatures do not a great game make. The initial set up can be quite time consuming as each player chooses their action cards, this is surprising given the lack of board set up time. Once play gets underway you quickly learn to despise the encounter deck.I can only assume that this clumsy tool was introduced to keep the adventurers on the move and to help balance the game with multiple players in the party but it ultimately ruins that game as it makes no sense thematically, simply forcing players to spend more time focusing on avoiding them than actually playing the game.


The second major flaw lies in the specific mission set up which is close to being brilliant, yet misses the mark totally. While they successfully create some level of story once you reach the objective, it's far too predictable up till that point, with eery single mission placing the objective somewhere between the 9th and 12th tile. This is a shame, because if some missions were longer than others or perhaps had multiple objective points, (say you find the door but can not pass until you recover the key from a second objective as a very simple example) as it stands you simply plod round the dungeon until the objective tile is laid then you play the specific end game.

The end game itself is always unique, well developed and thematically appropriate though.

I have played some thoroughly enjoyable games of Drizzt, and with the right friends it can be a blast, but at the end of the day I can seldom get it on the table with either my children or games group who don't enjoy it much.

I really didn't like the lack-luster card presentation but the game itself was ok.  Feels like each game in the series kept getting a little bit better and despite having gotten rid of these games for Descent 2.0 I have recently picked up the 4th one in the series (The Temple of Elemental Evil) as I hear it adds a campaign system and such.  It may be that I'll need to re-acquire these other games if that tips the scales enough in the positive.  I did play some D&D back in the day, not a lot, but I also played a ton of the gold box version computer games so I have intimate familiarity with the classes and spells and such.  From that nostalgic standpoint the game works fairly well and feels a bit like D&D from a combat standpoint anyway.

Drizzt does a good job of condensing D&D down to its essence, at least as far as combat goes.

A cooperative game of adventure for 1-5 players set in the world of Dungeons & Dragons.It is named after the book series by the same name recounting the adventures of the dark elf Drizzt Do'Urden and his friends.Designed for 1-5 players, this boardgame features multiple scenarios, challenging quests, and cooperative game play. Players explore the game world, which is built during the game by laying out tiles, using ready-made player characters and encountering enemies with corresponding miniatures. Encounters are generated by drawing cards and resolved using a D20 die. All players win together, depending on the scenario, by escaping, saving others or overcoming a threat.

This is the first D&D product I've owned in about 30 years since I turned my back on D&D as an RPG in favor of Metagaming's "The Fantasy Trip" (by none other than Steve Jackson). If I want a good RPG I'll play something other than D&D, but if I want a board game dungeon crawl this is OK. Great components although the cards are a bit flimsy. Rule book is short and easy to follow. Easy to play. Theme is rich. This will fit well as a family game or as a great filler for an RPG group.

As someone who doesn't have a group to play the Dnd RPG with, Legend of Drizzt (my personal favorite of the Dnd boardgames) is a great way to get engrossed in the DnD world. Even without a whole lot of room for character advancement, you can still customize the game to your liking. Each set comes with a number of quests laid out for you, but there are plenty of resources online for designing and running your own campaigns. As far as plastic figurines go, these are pretty fantastic. Dungeon delving with them is a blast.

RATING: 8.9
Playing this game vanilla out of the box is mediocre at best.  With some modding, this game is great.  I highly recommend buying some fan-made monster and treasure card expansions with the matching minis and using deeper leveling rules (see NinjaDorg's mods).  With enough extra material, dungeons can easily be designed with themes and combined to create a campaign.  The best part is that this can be played without a GM.

I don't like the way the maps are generated.  At all.  There is zero exploration, nothing interesting to find, and they are just plain ugly.  That this game requires so many modifications just to get in fun state is a testament to its problems.  Modding a game will take you only so far.  Wish they had gone with a random dungeon system like Warhammer Quest like Shadows of Brimstone did.

I will say, though, that the combat is more fun than Descent.  Using some of the extra components from all the expansions (doors, treasure & monster tokens, etc) I've actually made the game a lot more interesting with additional "side" rooms to explore for loot.  I've had a lot more fun playing this way than the vanilla game.

A sweet dungeon crawler that stays true to its nature... that's to say you go down the dungeon and fight your way out. Those who reiterate why go down the dungeon in the first place, can bugger off.. Not as complex as Descent, the game it self plays the bad guy here, allowing the players a full co-op feel. To make it more intresting, there are levels where players are pitted against each other.

This is a fun game. I enjoy the D&D world. The one annoying thing about this game though is the constant drawing of these encounter cards that cause bad things to happen to you. You don't feel like you are exploring a dungeon just trying to find ways of avoiding drawing these encounter cards. 

Still, the scenarios are very interesting and the character abilities and monster models are just outstanding. Lots of replayability here.

I rated this a little higher than the previous games, Castle Ravenloft and Wrath of Ashardalon, because 

1) the heroes have more interesting powers, particularly the "stances", which allow you to select what sort of power you'd like each turn.

2) it has the most balanced treasure deck w/r/t blessings vs. items.

3) it has the best dungeon tiles, with more enclosures and even a dead end; this lends the tile layout a greater sense of direction and form. 

Very good game.

This does a pretty good job of being a short D&D adventure and capturing the feel of exploration and combat.  Unfortunately, I like my RPG dungeon crawler board games to include some character advancement, and this doesn't really have enough of that for me.

RATING: 8
Like its predecessors, LoD is a fun, streamlined dungeon crawl that captures a lot of what I like about D&D 4e while leaving out what I don't like about it. It's a great game.

LoD has a different feel in some respects than CR and WoA, which is cool. The core experience is unchanged, but the vibe is different (as WoA was different from CR). For me, CR is about the brutal encounters, which are nearly always wretched and hard to do anything about; WoA is about spawning monsters.

LoD has a pretty forgiving encounter deck (we saw the whole thing on our first play), and the monsters are an interesting mix of OMG (feral troll) and weenies. It definitely has the most interesting characters, with stances, mobility, and no dedicated healer but a variety of small ways to heal. Catti-Brie is stellar, and Drizzt is nifty; some of the others look good, some look so-so.

Having only read the Dark Elf Trilogy (but being broadly familiar with the Icewind Dale series), they did a great job capturing and modeling the characters and tenor of the books. I'm looking forward to seeing the rest of the adventures.

Slightly better but maybe easier than Wrath of Ashardalon. I like the variation added with the new tiles and the stance option. The secret tunnels and loads of other items. A good game for 2. Really good value for money as the box is packed with stuff. Opening the box for the first time is amazing -. Got this for my 8 year olds birthday and he was well made up!

RATING: 8
I know nothing about Drizzt, so the thematic elements of this are somewhat lost on me. And that's key - there are sacrifices made here in gameplay terms to up the theme and narrative, which totally bypass me. It's still good fun though, and I particularly like the competitive adventures, but for me it's the weakest of the three adventure system games. But if you love Drizzt, you might well feel the opposite. See my review for more details: http://fortressat.com/index.php/articles-boardgame-reviews/2928-legend-of-drizzt-review

Good: 
You get to play as familiar characters from the Forgotten Realms DnD setting. 

The rules are straight forward making it extremely easy to get into and start playing. 

When we played, there were times when the adventure would get hairy, but we manage to pull through and finish making the games feel well balanced. 

Good quality components. 

Bad: 
This series is entertaining, but Descent has more variety, actual character advancement, campaign play, and an app that keeps things a bit more interesting.

While there are many improvements on the system, mainly the hero stances and PvP modes, as a standalone game I found it less fun than Ashardalon. Overpowered heroes, less monsters due to the lack of Sentries, weak encounter deck. Some of the head to head scenarios looks really fun on paper, but proven boring in play. Not bad, but isn't the box I'd recommend to start with. Good expansion to flesh out the other games in the series.

Enjoyed the 2 previous D&D board games but find this one to be the most balanced so far. The encounters cards in Wrath were bit overbearing and annoying. The encounters in Legend are in Legend are more mild with no environment cards that stay in play. Nice mix on monsters with excellent sculptures and the cave tiles are more interesting with quite a few unique ones.

I bought this primarily to play solo, with the hopes of getting some others to play occasionally.  I had echoes of Hero Quest in my mind, and was hoping to re-live some of that experience.  

It let me down a bit.  I'm disappointed that it doesn't seem to matter which direction I head in, as long as I keep moving.  One tile is mostly the same as another.  

I haven't finished the Adventure Book, so this is maybe premature, but apart from the major events, the actual dungeon crawling is a bit same-y. 

I'd have enjoyed it more if there were some character building from adventure to adventure.  I'm sure there are some great campaigns people have made for it, and I probably need to look into them.

This is the best of the thrree IMHO.  The mechanics are superior even to Ashardalon in many ways, and the options for playing style are better.

Nice work guys..   I'm a big fan.

I get that this is a dumbed down version of DnD, but really you only roll one d20 and then the rest of the time you just move about the board - not that exciting

Maybe if there were more decisions to be made, or if the whole 'encounter card' requirement was retooled, it might have been a bigger hit for me

Still, I liked the dungeon explore aspect of the game, but when compared to Gloomhaven, well, one of those two is rated #1 for a reason

RATING: 7
Update:  While we did enjoy this game, I don't see us playing it much more since Mice & Mystics does so much more.

Rating after a few 4-5 adventures.  Every game has been pretty close for the most part.  It has been a fun experience solitaire as well as with 2 and 3 people (haven't tried with more).  So far the decisions have been pretty clear cut but haven't gotten into the advanced deck yet.  I really like the different types of scenarios.  

11 year old boy (has read a number of the Drizzt books) likes it (quite a bit) and has requested we play it again several times.  8 year old girl (only 1 adventure) initially thought it boring until she got a feel for her character's abilities.  I think she might like to play again.

The only (minor) complaint/fear is that there won't be much real decision making once we've become familiar with the powers. 

Good game.

It fills a niche for an older D&D gamer like myself. I've been dying to play D&D again, but being a DM seems silly at my age unless playing with kids and nobody wants to be the bad guy against everybody else. A great fast paced game full of strategy. Maybe not the same as something like War of the Ring, but more like Arkham Horror with lots of important decisions on every turn. Where you end your movement, how to deal with monsters, traps, villains and encounters and not wanting that 4hp elf in your party to explore is just part of the fun. 
It is a team game, you really have to work as a party and there is so much going on in each players area, it is impossible for anybody to take somebody else's turn. Generally you know what needs to be done on your turn anyway (some good ol' monster killin.)
 My fav part of this game is EASILY being able to run a campaign, come up with your own story with actual plot, character dialogue and such without having to change a thing about the game.

Loved the books so I was excited to play the adventures myself. However, having played D&D 4, I couldn't escape the watered down feeling. I didn't wind up feeling awesome and even though the individuality of the characters (Cattibrie's sword, Guenhwyvar for Drizzt, etc) since the are combat or daily special cards, it gets lost in the mechanics. While you play cooperatively, the way the board plays itself does take away from the setting a bit. However, not a bad way to get someone familiar with the books but not a gamer into playing.

Purchased Dungeon Command: Blood of Gruumsh and Curse of Undeath for additional monster variety. The included campaigns are fun and allow players to live the novels, but designing a dungeon with friends is a lot of fun too!
We struggled a bit two player, especially against stronger monsters like the feral troll. Once we played as two heroes instead of one the play felt more balanced. Using a companion helped balance the game as well. Playing four player, with each player controlling one hero, balances well also.

Light cooperative dungeon delver, with very simple rules and and a really easy to manage AI that provides for some challenging situations. 

The components are top notch: cool miniatures, thick cardboard, nice insert...

It includes an adventure book that contains a dozen adventures. The provide very light background and very few sepecific rules, not really different than anything you can improvise. The best news about this book is that it also provides different game modes, competitive play, team competition, solo adventures, etc. 

The characters are different enough to provide different gaming experiences and to allow for some tactics. Drizzt is overpowered, but that's something you can accept, given the background and its cooperative nature.

Replayability is not huge. You can easily improvise more adventures, but the feeling is pretty much the same for everyone of them (except the different game modes). You can add components from other D&D games (Castle Ravenloft, Wrath of Ashardlon) to add some variation.

This is a light and much shorter Descent, for those who want a more fluid game.

Like it a bit more than Ravenloft as the treasures in this game feel more like treasures and reward, rather than one-shot effects that quite a lot of time are useless. Easy rules and nice componenets should get new players in quite quick. Watch out for usual co-operative game problems were one person would start to tell others what to do and how. Everyone should play they're own character and use only general directions for discussing the situation.

A simple 1-5 player cooperative or competitive (depending on the scenario) dungeon crawler that can be played in under an hour (if everyone knows how to play).

OK I have only played this game solo. No one wants to play a dungeon crawler with me :( I need a gaming group. But what I did play I enjoyed. Borrows very heavily from 4E ruleset (which may or may not attract you to the game), has a nice enemy action mechanic and comes laden with high quality components. Fun and thematic, but not my go-to game by any means.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Elegant in its rules, simple, logical but working. Could be deeper from the tactical point of view (no LoS rules, monster movement and blocking...).

House rules
Variant suggested by amodman: "Hero and exploration phases are put together. Every player is allowed to explore one and only one tile on the hero phase of their turn. Moreover, that player rolls 1d20 once they do so (and resolve any potential events from encounter cards). If the result is a 10 or higher--that tile spawns two monsters. The first drawn monster is placed on the mushroom patch. The second is placed anywhere on the tile except for the spaces right next to the tile the hero is on (no cheap melee ranged attacks if you don't have any movement left).

In play, I think this basically balances out allowing the heroes the ability to move into the tiles and attack on their turn. A lot of the time, there'll still be another monster to jump on them anyway."

[b]Dungeons & Dragons: The Legend of Drizzt Board Game [/b]

[i]This was one of the first games I got to play with my kids. At the time we had played a lot of Forbidden Island, so I thought a dungeon crawl co-op sounded fun.
This game is easy to teach and definitely accessible to kids. My kids really enjoyed it for a while, this was a game they would play by themselves sometimes.

However; eventually our collection began to grow and this game just sat on our shelves in favor of other games. I definitely think this game loses some of it's luster after multiple plays, the game play gets repetitive and stale.[/i]

The same gameplay and feel as Castle Ravenloft and Wrath Of Ashardalon, the differences being a different set of monsters plus a different batch of tiles to be gone through. Here we're going underground passages and caves. It remains a likeable co-op which gets a bit same-y though from turn to turn as you progress through a scenario. Move, whack a monster with a die roll, add a tile to the dungeon, reveal another monster, monsters do their move or whack as per their instructions on their card. The group decisions are to split up or stay together, what to explore, who's going to whack what in what order (ie there's not a real lot there). Life gets more or less difficult for you depending on the die rolls and which monsters get revealed. It's pleasant enough if you ham it up enough.

RATING: 6
an improvement over the first version of the game. The small changes help the game be more likeable. 

While I understand this is suppose to be a light fast playing co-op game, I still wish there was a little more meat to it. 

I would also only play this with 3-4 heroes divided up between two players only. The vast amount of player made content is much appreciated.

I'll probably keep this for playing Pathfinder role playing sessions.

edit: nope I guess not... sold.

The board game version of D&D is a very good way of introducing people to the dungeon crawl world.Very easy to understand, no complex rules or powers. The game will eventually lose its charm due to lack of expansions.

Liked this best of the series since some of the characters have stances which means they get to interact with newly discovered monsters before they get their first attack in.

I think I would like the first 2 more if it wasn't automatic that you need to suffer one attack from every discovered monster before you get to do an action back at them. High armour seems the most important attribute because of this.

Picked this up after my playing Dungeon!, and some basic D&D and Pathfinder adventures with my daughter. 

As a family we really love the co-op aspect. My wife really got into playing the character she chose, as did my daughter. We like that it's much quicker and easier to throw a game of this together as opposed to D&D or Pathfinder.

We also like the replay ability in being able to compose our adventures, and find other player made ones.

Dungeon crawling with out DM. I like the mechanics quite a bit.

Basically 4th edition Dungeons & Dragons in board game form, which is fine if you're into that. Personally, I find 4th edition rules to be too simplified and a little boring. It's a decent game, but a little too random. Drizzt is probably the best of the three games currently released (Ravenloft and Ashardalon). There are better dungeon crawl games out there.

RATING: 9
Fast paced and funfilled dungeon crawl with a high replayability. Easy to teach but not always that easy to play well. There are many different scenarios with each it's own little twists and different elements. Playing time is about 45 to 120 min depending on scenario and number of players. Optimal player number is 1-3 players. A 4-player game is still nice but a 5-player game just takes a bit too long and there is a lot to keep track of with all the cards in front of each player. People just seems to forget to use their cards and interaction between players becomes harder. 

This game is supposed to be fun thematic experience, not a training exercise of your arithmetic skills. Nevertheless players are constantly struggling with difficult decisions and players always seem to forget something or make some mistakes during the game. In my opinion the weight vs. playing time is in perfect balance. The ending is nearly always climaxing and high in tension. 

I didn't find enough variety in the monster, encounter and treasure decks, so I immediately bought Wrath of Ashardalon to add more variety. If you like the game after a couple games, buy WoA and mix the two games together to have even more fun with the game. Not a game to be played too often to wear it out but occasionally it can be great fun. Definitely not for people who cry about bad dice rolls or can't get more into the theme.

I've played this exclusively solo so far and I'm not sure I'll ever get this on the table with others. 

Plays very well solo and I've kept all of my first 9 plays to the first 4 adventures, replaying several of them a few times. 

Depending on the adventure, a play lasts me about one hour which is probably slightly long for my current tastes for a solo game. It also tends to get more complicated at the end game as I'll have a villain to run every turn and likely multiple monsters to juggle. After a game I'm always ready to be done with it, but it isn't long (often later that day) before I want to play again. Kind of a strange dichotomy, but there you have it.

Nice,easy to learn, fast dungeon crawler - well, more like a skirmish game.
One major problem is the ugly, bland cards and dungeon tiles - compared with other dungeon crawlers (Descent v. 2, Mice & Mystics, etc.). That reduces immersion and chances that the game will hit the table often.

Very underwhelming experience. Although nothing majorly wrong regarding the game mechanics, except for a few cases such as unclear encounter/treasure cards and broken enemy movement, the experience really doesn't usually some close to what it's trying to achieve. No role play, no real story, and no fun.

It works well as a light social activity, but I'd not recommend for serious gamers.

Cannot wait to put my hands on the other titles too!

[b]Traded August 2016[/b]

Warning: [b]HARSH[/b]

I've read nearly all of the Forgotten Realms books featuring Drizzt except for most recent series. Most I've read more than once over the last 20 years. Heck, I own all of them except those I haven't read. I'm not a fanboy by any means, but I'm not ashamed to say that I really enjoy them (at least in the past when I did read).

So ever since this game came out I've had a nagging urge to try this game. I've read the reviews and the posts on SGoYT. [i]And I realized, that just like the sense I got from reading reviews about its two predecessors, that this game most likely wasn't going to be for me.[/i] Yet the nagging feeling persisted. Bought it and here goes:

I played the first scenario (introductory and designed for 1 character solitaire) three times today, twice by myself and once with my daughter, coaching her through the gameplay. All three were resounding losses. The third was actually quite dramatic, as with one hit point left and one movement point shy of reaching the escape square that would have given me a victory I was snatched back to the start tile by an event tile. Forced to make his way through a horde of enemies, little plastic Drizzt the Bad Hombre didn't make it through the gauntlet on his way back. 

:thumbsdown: [b]THEME.[/b] I read the raving from BGG fans: [i]It evokes the feeling of the books. It feels like Drizzt and all his friends kicking ass and taking treasure. Oh my God, Drizzt we love you! Now with plastic minis of each I can finally make Drizzt and Cattie-brie get together just like I thought they should have in the Legacy of the Drow series because Wulfgar is boring and one-dimensional.[/i] [b]BULLCRAP.[/b] :star: For a moment, picture the sequence in [i]Star Wars: A New Hope[/i] where Luke, Han, and Chewie are attempting to rescue Leia from the detention block on the Death Star. Now you're playing the boardgame version with cool minis. Only instead of fighting just stormtroopers and a few other ancillary Empire personnel, you as our favorite Rebels also need to fight through a random assortment of enemies. Like the Rancor, a Wampa from Hoth, Jabba the Hut with an assortment of his alien cronies, Vader and Emperor Palpatine. All cohabitating together on your planned evac route on the Death Star. Why not throw in our favorite bounty hunter, Boba Fett as well? And give Luke a lightsaber during that sequence for good measure as well, while you're at it, even though it's not true to the Star Wars canon at that time. :star:

That's what this game is. Instead of fighting a battle with the enemies that Drizzt would have faced, you fight against a sampling of enemies that Drizzt fought over many decades (and books) all in the same place. For me it was disappointing to square off against a drow elf, a solitary goblin, a water elemental, some kind of ghost, and a troll. In the aptly named [i]Legend of Drizzt[/i] they grabbed something from each part of his story and threw it all together in a big mashup.

Instead, I think they should have [b]focused on a narrower period of time [/b]in the storyline so that the player could fight a series of adventures/scenarios that better represented the story depicted a few specific books. [b]They went too broad which spread the theme too thin[/b]. They could have easily made a great game by focusing on the Dark Elf Trilogy when Drizzt was young during his time in the Underdark both when he was with and after he had left Drow society. There were all sorts of combat sequences when he was on patrol and after that when he was usually on his own.

:thumbsdown: [b]The AI implementation sucks. PERIOD.[/b] Perhaps I've been spoiled on my very few plays of [thing=42776][/thing]. Even with their misstep on the theme, they still could have had a great game by using gameplay elements more similar to those used in GoW. Things here are [b]much more predictable[/b]. One character explores a new square. You know you're gonna get exactly one monster. [b]You know EXACTLY how it will behave[/b]. It will have three possible moves at the most, likely just two. And it's completely deterministic - you know what it will do. There's none of the brilliant variation present in GoW that keeps the player on his toes and makes gameplay dynamic. Yes, there's an Encounter deck (random events) that will shake things up. At least there's a bit of uncertainty as to if you will draw a card when exploring. In Gears of War the baddies not only move as a team but they keep you guessing both in their actions and when they'll spawn. 

:thumbsdown: [b]Decision making.[/b] Or the relative lack thereof. LoD allows each player to select certain power cards. These are what you will use to attack and to modify movement. I actually think they are pretty well done for what they are. But they are largely fixed. They stay with you the entire game. You might get an extra if you level up. At most you'll have to flip certain cards after using them which will make them unavailable until you draw a treasure card that allows you to reactivate them. Pretty deterministic, no dynamism, not much excitement. Gears of War gives the player a constantly changing hand that acts as both his characters health as well as provides him with his tactical options. In this regard GoW is once again much superior to LoD.

:thumbsdown: [b]Treasures.[/b] Ewww...Generic, overpowered, repetitive, not thematic. Kill a puny goblin? Draw a treasure card and get a magic wand. Kill a water elemental? You just found a burning oil concoction you can use to burn the next water elemental to death. They say oil and water don't mix, but in this game that water elemental might drop the firebomb he's carrying. I actually like the events that happen within the treasure deck, but the loot itself is cliche, over the top, and absurdly random thematically.

Well that about sums it up. [b]I just completely trashed this game[/b] after only three plays of the first scenario. [b]And I don't feel bad about it.[/b] The only other time I've felt this disappointed in a game was when I played [thing=105023][/thing] about the same time last year. Just like then, the disappointment this time manifested itself almost immediately. I thought about quitting early during each game. I was mad (and still am disappointed) that I wasted all that time on this game when I could have kept on playing Pathfinder: Rise of the Runelords (also not without its problems but far superior to this). [i]I should have trusted my game radar and stayed away from this.[/i] Because mystery is sexy and then I could at least always wonder how my life would have turned out had I went with LoD. And I could have bought a book instead and put it in a box to read 20 years from now.

Harsh words aside I might give this game another shot after I cool down. Just to try a different scenario with multiple characters. But I think that'll just be a waste of time because it won't correct any of the faults I see.

[b]So what is there to like or who might enjoy this?[/b]
:thumbsup: The game is easy to learn. Very easy. The rulebook is about 15 pages and I had it read and comprehended very quickly. I played with minimal rule referencing. 
:thumbsup: It seems like it plays very quickly. The game is very simple and monster activations are resolved rapidly.
:thumbsup: The components are excellent (the cards could be a bit sturdier, though). The miniatures are great and come in all shapes and sizes. One is huge, like bigger than a softball. I've never seen such a big plastic mini. Let's call it a bigi. Balor the bigi. The cardboard components are attractive, thick, and sturdy. I really like how the jigsaw board fits together. There's enough play in the cut that the pieces pop in and out very easily. This is an improvement over Doom: The Boardgame where the jigsaw tolerances are too tight.
:thumbsup: If you don't know or care about the stories this is based on that'll make one of my biggest complaints moot.
:thumbsup: If you just want a fast paced and pretty light game with cool miniatures/components and some action then maybe take a look.

[b]Summary[/b]
Playing this game made me want to box it up and bring out Pathfinder ASAP. I hope I can do that tomorrow and get my good vibes back. I might give it a another go with my daughter. Perhaps it'll click with her and if it does that might be a reason to keep it. Or I might just try to sell it and get it out of my sight.

[b]Pros:[/b]
- Great replayability and variability due to:
--- 8 heroes with very different playing style and perks
--- Every boss is tough in different way
--- 13 different adventures
--- Random card drawing (Encounters, Treasures) from deck
--- Random generated dungeon
--- d20 dice rolling
- You can create your own adventures (there are tokens in the game that are not used in any of 13 included Adventures).
- You can expand your game by buying:
--- standalone [boardgamefamily=9547]D&D Adventure System Board Games[/boardgamefamily] (new monsters, heroes, tiles, enounters, setting)
--- standalone [boardgamefamily=18299]Dungeon Commands[/boardgamefamily] (new monsters, allies) 

[b]Cons:[/b]
- Successful games under 3 or 4 hours are very rare.
- After about 10 games, monsters and encounters are still the same. But you can expand them (see Pros)
- Not so beautiful miniatures as in [boardgamefamily=18299]Dungeon Commands[/boardgamefamily]. They are not painted. But still very nice.

[b]Note:[/b]
- I encourage you to randomly select Daily powers, Utility powers and At-will powers. It will make every game different (even with the same hero).

I had high hopes for this D&D series but its really simple. I mean, far too simple. The simplicity doesnt stop there, the way the phases work is rubbish and every enemy having a bonus to hit score just means that the playtesting was never done very well. Avoid this series if you actually like boardgames because this really is nothing other than a pretty box on the shelf.

This is my favorite of the D&D Adventure games, because of the slightly-increased detail and theme. It's also probably the easiest one, which isn't really a strike for or against but will help when people make purchasing decisions. This is also the obvious get for those who like Salvatore's Drizzt novels, and I think those people will like it best too. But it's still the same system, with all of the same good stuff.

I love dungeon crawlers. In fact the first I ever played was hero quest back in 96. Fell in love, then went on to play mutant chronicles and war hammer quest. This one is right up there. Light enough to get non gamers to try and heavy enough the group still brings it out. Solid game that changes and is new every time. Painting the pieces really adds to it too.

RATING: 8
Legend of Drizzt (for my money, and after one play) improves on some areas where people have found flaws in Ravenloft's design. The encounter cards are less arbitrary and take-thatish, feel more integrated to the board: for example, there are cards that trigger damage from specific tiles (those marked with lava vents) which definitely works better than the entirely random events in Ravenloft. Although the game order is still the same, there are now heroes with powers that allow them to avoid or lessen the effect of a new monster's first strike. As a result, heroes are much, much tougher than in Ravenloft - to make up somewhat for this (but not entirely, the game is definitely easier now), there are now some considerably stronger wandering monsters (eg Feral Troll). 

I also like small touches such as that 'monster piles' ('shrooms in this version) are sometimes placed on the cards in places which could occasionally make them adjacent to an exploring hero, and the fact that there is a little bit more variety in monsters from the standard 3 of a kind in CR and WoA.

I guess the fact that these changes have been made acknowledges that the original design can be improved upon. I don't think the changes will be enough for people who found Ravenloft or Ashardalon completely lacking in charm, but those who have problems with the game but still find themselves inexplicably drawn to it just might be happier with the latest incarnation. 

I suspect that the variety of monsters and villains of the original are more to my taste still, but time will tell on that score. I have no interest at all in either the Ravenloft or Drizzt brands, which is no hindrance for me. The silly unpronouncable names are a big plus, but why is Drzzzzzzt's pet cat named after King Arthur's wife? Odd.

RATING: 9
I really like the new stance mechanic and that some of the tiles now influence gameplay and make positioning even more important. I also like that fewer encounters are triggered during a game and that the monster deck now includes some events for added diversity (more of those, please!).

Cons:
- Some of the adventures are not playable by 2 players
- Regis's hero design may fit thematically, but he seems weak compared to the other heroes (especially for 2 players)
- Drizzt's hero design may fit thematically, but he seems overpowered compared to the other heroes

We've enjoyed Drizzt so far.  Much like Ravenloft, the system works well and we enjoy co-ops, though I have nothing telling me we'll be holding on to Drizzt any more than we held on to Ravenloft.  But in the end, I think Drizzt will be seen as the best in the series (note, I have yet to play Ashardalon).

Fun cooperative dungeon crawl. Having played Castle Ravenloft, I can't say that there is a ton that is new here that merits owning this one in addition, but this certainly is a quality incarnation of the D&D boardgame series for those not owning a copy. It's got some nice elements: some really pretty bits, fairly simple ruleset, fun trying kill some monsters and then fight the main super villain at the end.

I played the D&D adventure systema couple of times and just picked up this one for a reduced price.

It is a quite light dungeon crawler, but can be fun with the right group - for me personally some roleplaying is required to really enjoy this.

Even with only one fo the games there are quite a few ways you can choose the skills for the different heroes.

The scenarios are stand alone games, which seem quite replayable: random dungeon layout, monsters and encounters will guarantee it and you can always try them with different heroes/skill choises - some scenarios will even provide a random boss fight at the end so you are never sure what to expect.

There are also some quite unique scenarios (for this system) - e.g. a fullly explored closed dungeon which spawns mosnters from 4 special tiles and you have to survive and destroy their spawn points.
One of the competitive scenario is a competition for who can slay the most monsters.
etc.

A fun dungeon-crawler which doesn't require a player to act as GM. Many of the rules come from 4e D&D, so it's best to play with people who already know that system. This is easily the best game of the series, with more tactical choices and some really unique character designs (plus more characters to choose from).

I started reading the book series recently and was hooked. I've read 23 of the books in just a little over four months. 

Despite my relatively lackluster experience with Castle Ravenloft, I decided to give this game a try as I heard it was improved. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The game was just as bad as before, only now it had named characters I liked in it. This was not enough to change my opinion; if anything, I'm even more negative on it now because I know they could have done so much better.

One of the first games I picked up when I started to get into co-ops. Seemed really interesting from a novice perspective, but gets old really quick. Not worth the time to set up all the crap that comes with it. Yeah, miniatures look cool, but I've found I am certainly not into them without decent underlying gameplay. Probably more for D£D fans. I did pick up the books after this, and do enjoy those. Too many pieces, not enough variety of game play. After the fourth play, I can just never see myself wanting to play this again. Traded it for Sentinels of the Multiverse. We'll see how that plays out.

Drizzt is basically a multi-person solitaire puzzle, which I don't love. But it heightens drama via randomization, and it normalizes the team's investment by handing each player a set of management decisions that the other players won't care to track.

RATING: 9
Legend of Drizzt is board game taking place in a popular world of Dungeons & Dragons. Its an adventure game, where you won’t compete against each other, but unite your forces in face of common enemy. Like mercenaries, you will explore dark caves with simple wish to accomplish your quest. There will be many monsters standing in your way and you will control them, getting them closer to your heroes. Miniatures will enable you to really live through the story and simple rules won’t stay in your way. Everything is focused on maximizing experience for everyone – no difference regarding board game knowledge. You will love Drizzt for different scenarios. Enemies are randomly generated from shuffled pile on end of each turn inside each time differently shaped dungeon. You even will not be bothered, that some matches can be a little easier than others, thanks to monster draw. But there is always some final boss welcoming you in the end. Your heroes have different skills picked by you in the preparation phase. But you have to use them carefully, because they might have limits. You have to have some luck while fighting to hit your enemies, but the damage is strictly given from attack card. Enjoy common adventure with everything it should have – play Legend of Drizzt!

A nice cut between hack and slash RPGs and board games. It allows for much creativity in adventure making, even to play by one's self, since the randomization is part of the mechanics (and of course, since there is no need for a DM).

High rate for the solo play and the possibilities in fast and easy adventure making due to the simple rules.

This game slaps you around the moment you open the box. It's really really hard.

Everything about it production-wise is A+. Really the theme is awesome.

That said, I think it could use more RP. Basically it's DND but without any RP and only relentless encounters. I think we've won 1 scenario.

I've read every Drizzt book so I keep it around. Every now and then I feel like being abused so I play it.

A slight improvement over the other games in this cooperative series. It's challenging, but repetitive, draws upon the Drizzt series without really satisfying, and you'll find yourself killed more by random lava vents than the dastardly drow. Skip it unless you love the series already.

A good cooperative game that has the plus of the D&D theme. The 4th edition rules work really well in the board game. The production value is high - the minis are beautiful and the components give your money worth.

There is a good deal of luck in the game (dice rolls, blind draft of enemies, treasures, and so forth), that isn't far off what you will encounter in many RPG sessions.

This, nonetheless, isn't an RPG. No roleplay is required.

Being a mission-based game usually meant that the game isn't all that high in the replay value department, but since the game has a lot of random aspects, I guess this game can have more replay value than usual.

Co-operative tile laying game where players pick one of eight characters to complete a specified quest. The scenario book has 16 adventures meaning there is variety available and I understand this game is compatible with Ravenloft and Ashardalon. If you've played AD&D before then some mechanisms will be familiar but essentially it boils down to move, battle and explore. The game is challenging, attempts to throw a lot at you and does require co-operation but as yet we have not failed a quest. There are a wealth of components in the box; I think some of the figures for monsters are oversized and whilst I like the look of them I do wonder if production costs could have been brought down by reducing the average size of monsters.

We found this to be a faithful implementation of everything wrong and boring with 4e D&D. The pacing is awkward, making every action able to feel 'wrong' to the players. Ultimately, success seems more bound to the position of the objective map tile in the draw pile, and to the distribution of treasure and monsters in those decks, than to any skill on part of the players.

The encounter deck is thankfully much more forgiving than previous efforts, for this alone I would rank it higher but the tile art is also nicer and I like the end pieces. The other main improvement is that you can finally attack before the monster does!

Yep, this is the edition to keep. An excellent, low complexity, fun, co-operative and soloable dungeon crawler with no need for some poor blighter to play the GM. Fabulous!

Atmospheric modular board game, with a wider scope than the in-box scenarios initially suggest. Captures the feeling of being in the simplistic-but-exciting D&D universe well, and zips along at a hair-blowing pace. 
Highly recommended you download some user-created scenarios, which are generally much more interesting and inventive than those in the box.

Egy D&D 4th generation harci szimulátor a nappalidban! Egyedi és pörgős játékélmény, jó történetadaptáció R.A. Salvatore regényeiből. Egyedi térképlapkák, figurák, tokenek, d20, adaptálódó szörnyek, storyline - minden ami kell, de mesélő nélkül, bár egy kicsit borsos áron.
1-5 hős ereszkedik alá Mélysötét barlangjaiba, mindig újabb ellenség nyomában, vagy épp előlük meneülve. A kerettörténetet egy külön füzet tartalamazza, összesen 13 előre írt kalanddal. Általában egy bizonyos térképrészlet előkerüléséig felfedezés és harc, onnantól scripteltebb "boss-fight" van.
Nagyon elmés mechanizmus tartja kordában a játékidőt: ha nem fedezel fel újabb részt a dungeon-ból (azaz nem hozod közelebb a végkifejletet) a körödben, 100%, hogy egy "encounter" lapot kell húznod, ami sosem jó és a legtöbbször rossz - míg ha felfedezel, akkor csak kb. 50% ez az esély. Tehát ha megállunk gyógyulni, visszaténfergünk, akkor "ránk dől" a barlang - ez egy haladós, pörgős, és nem is túl nehéz játék.

Two solo plays on the first scenario. Quite simple and may be not that entertaining with only one player and one character. I need to try this in a group. The game looks good, the miniatures are nice, the components are good material and so on.

First group play behind, it was nice. Of course it took quite a long time because of the newbies, but less than I expected. Couple of more plays and I'll be able to give a better opinion.

The next two adventures played with a group, it was nice and reasonable fast. We won the other and lost the other, so some success at last.

Played the first scenario again as solo, I was successful this time. Now the rules are familiar and play is rather smooth. There are some question marks still when interpreting the rules, but nothing serious. It is good, that each scenario can be played multiple times and the play is different each time.

Two more group plays, very nice, now when the rules are familiar.

The best of the three D&D cooperative games. I like it more than Claustrophobia two-player because I have a mild preference for cooperative games. The tiles are a bit plain, but better than Castle Ravenloft or Wrath. The monster pieces are attractive.

Games are nail-biting and fun, although it's best played in small doses because it can get samey. Games can play out in under an hour.

This got played a lot. Got boxes full of customized stuff. Custom Heroes, Monsters, Villains, Treasure Decks and more. The toys/minis looks great. Card graphics is pretty bad. This game don't find its way to the table anymore.

Lots of tools to modify gameplay

Models are a little fiddly
Game can be half a table or more depending on scenario

My personal favorite of the D&D board games (Haven't played TOE yet) mainly because of the Drow setting and the famous characters in the D&D universe. Reminds me of Icewind Dale 2 (When you go into the underdark)on a board game.

Another solid hit and extension of this game system.  It's not deep nor does it take itself as serious as the full RPG game.  Grab a beer, go along for the ride and enjoy the experience.  Nice components as usual.

After one play, I'm enjoying this more than Wrath of Ashardalon. Take everything that made that game awesome and amplify the monsters, treasure, and attacks and you have Legend of Drizzt. So far it strikes me as harder, but I've heard the opposite from other folks.

Well I kind of hoped it will be more complicated, so be warned: D&D board games are pretty simple, if you're more tactics-oriented. Also, there are some rules issues when moving monsters from one tile to another. There isn't much competitive play, and because of its simplicity, this could make the game a little boring. I'd favor Descent (new edition) over this, but it can be fun with the right group of people.
The components are astonishing. I love every piece.

Great game! The scenarios are very well done, particularly number 7. I have many scenarios to play yet but the ones I did (several times) are awesome. Love the solitary play too. This is a great DungeonCrawler that must be in every collection.

RATING: 8.3
Well planned out adventure system based on the famous Drizzt characters of forgotten realms.  The figures are top notch and the character abilities make the game quite strategic.  This version of the 3 part series (Ravenloft and Adshardalon) is the most polished, although perhaps a little easier.  The characters and monsters can work in all 3, though.

RATING: 6
I really thought I would like this (the only one from the D&D series I have played) but the novelty quickly wore off and I found it very boring. It felt very generic and there were so few choices to make. After playing numerous scenarios I just gave up due to boredom.

RATING: 8
Enjoyable. I'm not sure, but we are going to have to make a table rule... no strategy discussions at the table. Otherwise it's just too easy.

These games are getting harder to rate.

[i]Castle Ravenloft[/i], the original, was a reminder that adventure games are meant to be cooperative and don't have to be 4-5 hours long.  A helping of self-inflicted chaos didn't hurt either.

[i]Wrath of Ashardalon[/i] took the base model and added multiple thematic enhancements: self-activated NPCs, a taunting dragon, and scorching walls that strip the virgin skin from unwary adventurers.  The quality of any interactive work is in its loving attention to detail, and this is where WoA beats Ravenloft - but only by a nose.  The only drawback is that Ashardalon is definitely longer than its groundbreaking ancestor, which may be enough to turn the tourists away.

[i]Legend of Drizzt[/i] may be at the point of diminishing returns, in that the walls and monsters are new but nothing comes across as being particularly fresh.  More is yet to be revealed, however, so I reserve the right to change my tune once I've worked my way through the full scenario booklet.

Favorite in the series if only for the theme and content.  Should integrate well with CR and WoA one I get around to mixing in some of the other games elements.

Kudos to Lee and the gang for producing 3 stand alone games that can play well together also.

This game is growing on me. I wasn't sure to begin with but I've found that I'm enjoying it more after a few plays. It is incredibly random with the encounter cards and die rolls dictating what happens more so than player choice but it is a short slightly brainless dungeon romp that scratches an itch from time to time.

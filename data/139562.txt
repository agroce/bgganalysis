There's a certain sameness to games about mining, isn't there?  Send your guys down the mine to dig out different types of gem/ore.  The deeper they go, the greater the rewards.  Of course, mining is a risky business and you could lose some of the stuff you have dug out in a mishap. The point of all this is to form sets of gems/ore and score points.  Rockwell has all these hackneyed elements.  It also boasts auctions, worker placement, area majorities, engine building and a point salad.  By rights it should be a mess and yet, credit to Bruno Crepault, it works.  There are some nice tensions around selling ore, bidding with it, delivering it for vps or holding onto it to gain achievements.  The worker placement element is also satisfyingly angsty.  However, I do feel that it plays long for what it offers, with that mine, sell ore, buy upgrades cycle getting a bit repetitive.

Rockwell is a handsome game.  My one criticism of the art is that blue and grey are poorly distinguished on the achievement tiles.  The rules are vague in parts, while a botched illustration and description of the set-up makes a lengthy process quite tiresome.

Rules took a while to plough through, but game was fairly accessible and logical and offered interesting choices.  Some luck depending on the resource cards drawn, but interesting area majority mechanism.  Some of the bonus cards rewarded for resources collected, but these were not then forfeited, enabling the resources to acquire further points scoring tiles.  The board did not need to be in pieces, simple resource tiles on the locations would have sufficed, but was probably more fun in its modular form.  First game we finished unexpectedly as we realised that the majority (2 of 3) of players reaching the centre of the board/earth, concluded the game.  Quite engaging.  Happy to play again.  One of the better KS games I have played.

Decent idea, but not a huge fan of the surprises. I know it makes perfect sense thematically, so not everyone will share my opinion on that. I also think some of the balance is off. I can't see where it makes sense to spend huge amounts of money to make your guys more mobile. And the risk/reward structures on improving your dudes don't make sense. The amount of cubes you lose in a disaster is equal to your drilling power, but the cubes you get is an even split with other players unless you have the largest power, in which case you get the remainder after dividing. But since you don't know what cubes are going to be available, it's totally random what the remainder will be. It was pretty frustrating to see other players get huge remainders while I got small remainders, completely irrespective to any decisions made. I also think the end game is a little weird. Everyone has tons of cubes and it's a mass sell off. Just seems a little anti-climactic. I think they could have encouraged more selling of cubes earlier if the cubes->vp tiles were all the same number of vp (per type), rather than having a bump up in vp halfway through. I would have made the vps for each type fixed, and have the costs strictly become more expensive. It's also one of those games where you need to set people up for cooperation, but if you spend your action doing the setting up, and the other player doesn't follow through, it's extremely irritating. Maybe that wouldn't happen as much with experienced players. It's also a bit weird in that it's a worker placement game, but you only have two workers each round, and only 4 different places to go. Didn't seem to provide a lot of breadth of decisions. And finally, seemed a little long for what it was. But to be fair, we also stumbled a bit with the rules after someone claimed they knew how to play, but turns out they only sorta knew.

Mining
Each player represents a mining company drilling the Earth to get resources. But drilling often request the help of other players (forced or not). Each one therefore moves four drills on the arcs stratum of the planet to successfully implement his mines and extract maximum resources. The Fame points are acquired by spending materials, filling objectives and having majorities of material and money at the end of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A mix of auction, race for goals, risk management, resource management and conversion, and area majority. Players have to do all of it well in order to be successful. The game can run a bit long, especially with the money to resource conversion needed to complete some goals. Neat artwork and decent component quality.

RATING: 6
My three player game of this was less than satisfactory: often the other two would isolate themselves on a side of the board, finishing digs together, and there was no way I could get involved (the game rewards helping each other, but using as few people to help as possible); only two of the three people could get money each round, and those actions always went first, which was brutal when I missed out; when you have no money and can't get more, there's really only one good action to take (bribes) which doubles the pain of being broke.  All that being said, there are parts of the game I did like, and I recognize that my issues might mostly be fixed in a four player game.  I'm keen to play again to find out, but not so keen that I might skip it over the games I actively already enjoy.

Actually a pretty nice game. 
Actions are exciting and mining never boring, though almost impossible to calculate where you will end up, as your opponents are allowed to drag you around too.
But great idea and theme!
Mechanics too - gotta love a game totally without dice!

A few flaws in end-game being too sudden and unpredictable, and rules could use a brush-up. Clear settings needed on movement among a few details.

Quick game to play. Takes a play or two to understand the mixmatch.

Interesting combination of mechanisms that takes a bit of working out with regards to timing and tactics. This led to numerous tactical errors (and also some silly rules mistakes) from all corners. Nonetheless a satisfying experience and very keen for a second play to iron out tactics and play rules correctly! Played well 3p despite there being no change to the extraction tiles' strength requirements.

Nice production value. Nice ideas, with a few issues. The sole tension in the market is in getting access to it. The rythm of the game is almost dictated by the need to get cash to upgrade to extract to get cash to upgrade to... ends up repetive. Since you need the "help" of other players to extract, its quite diffucult to try to try to change your tempo (this might actualy be an issue u=in a 3 player game, since one will be left out, out of synch). Won't buy or play it a second.

Personal: underrated game for Essen 2013, made no much noise. Worker placement, move your pawns and manage your resources. With just 2 workers and 3 places to place them you have a game with so many decisions to make. The way the resources are divided among players is awesome. You have to be opportunist when trying to drill and be the first to sell your resources for the best tiles with VP.

I liked the co-op aspects and the market, but felt it was too long for what ended as an game decided by how many shares (minerals) people kept or sold from behind their screens.  At our table, the difference between first and last would have flipped if one player had kept two more zinc cubes at the end.

Played for the first time with four players. A fair amount of rule checking meant the game lasted for around three and a half hours. A really nice game although we found some aspects of it unnecessarily fiddly. The whole excavation mechanic works brilliantly though.

there's a significant random element and I have concerns about replayability.  The semi-cooperative abstract/movement portion of the game is fine I think, but the different upgrade paths don't seem valuable because they don't directly help you earn victory points. I think there is just a straight and narrow path you need to walk if you want to win the game, and that's not very exciting.

Rockwell is great.  It can feel a little fluffy on the minutiae (the rule book is less-than helpful on that front; it probably could do with a crib sheet) but there's a lot of strengths to it nonetheless.  The sense of pace is kept up throughout and I love the way the board is set up and revealed over time; there's real theatre there! 

it's a happy marriage of:
a bit of worker-placement.
a bit of auctioning.
a bit of area control.

I've played it 3 times now; I look forward to playing it many many more times.

Surprisingly high sandbox-y feel for a game like this. It's... a bit of a worker placement race game?

Rockwell is an interesting worker placement game.

We played it with three and a strange thing happened.
I made sure to make my workers stronger and that encouraged other players to work with me.  This made me the runaway leader. Normally you see players working together to catch the leader. Now they were fighting to stay ahead of each other.

My only preorder at Essen 2013. Totally lived up to my expectations. Very interesting interaction with the Crew which (in most cases) will have to work together. Takes a long time to set up, even longer time to explain the rules, but somehow all that is forgotten once the game has started.

This is just the 3rd game from Sit Down! - my impression is, that they haven't fully developed (or could afford) good marketing, and thus this gem of a game will unfortunately remain off most peoples radar. My hopes is that word of mouth will give this game the recognition it deserves. Highly recommended.

The game is excellent... the interaction between players is superb... you need the help of the other players to be able to get enough mining "power" to mine the different sections of the board but you also have to time things well to be the one to trigger the mining or to be the one with the more mining power in the section or even having built an elevator shaft to that section.

The game looks pretty good too!

After my first play I think this game is cracking! There are multiple ways to gain VPs and the rounds move swiftly. With only 2 workers to place you really need to think of which actions are essential against those that can wait another round.
The theme is different and should make the game stand out front the crowd.
With players who avoid over-analysing every turn the game flies along at a good pace with a 3 player game completing in 70 minutes! A game of this depth hitting the under 90 minute runtime makes it one of my favourites.

after a 1st game with 3 players. it was fun but the rules could be more clear and I presume it will work better with 4 players. This rate might go up... or down after the next games, but for now it´s positive.
I liked the drilling a lot, although the leftovers not being hurt by the eventual dangerous event does not seem fair, specially if you only have a mine shaft there and you did not contribute to the excavation.
The market could be better though, don´t understand why it has fixed prices... markets normally flow...
But altogether it´s a fun and attractive game.

Edit: Well, above stated that the leftovers were not hurt by dangerous events, this is not correct, as it was cleared in the appropriate forum, but the rules could lead otherwise... 

Edit 2: Finally a 4 player game. This is the best number, the game is definitely for 4 players, the 3 player game is fun but perhaps unbalanced. 
Recommended!

only 1 play so far and a typical 3-player problem: 2 cluster together and excavate tile after tile, while the other stays behind. Also: only 2 trading spaces makes that the player who is left out overthere really has a hard time. I think the only shining number for this game is 4 players.

Very nice ideas grip into each other in this elegant game. The board is innovative and hidden victory points are always a good thing. The German rules could have been written better. Nevertheless a really cool worker placement game with top-notch components!

Won my first game 40-34-32. This game looks a lot more complicated than it is, but at its heart it's a good, solid euro. There are a number of paths to victory -- you can focus on fulfilling contracts or completing goals. Two bored players can end the game in a turn or two by moving to the center, so you have to pay close attention to what the others are doing.

Really feels like a Kickstarter.  I'm surprised there is a publisher behind that game as it lacks a lot of development and polish.

For the amount of time it takes to setup, explain and play, there is way to much randomness and little value.

Most upgrade aren't worth it.  The worker placement is dull and so is the fixed market.  Most of the action feels tacked on.  The moving is dreadful.  The trade off between objectives and orders needs fixing.

I really like the earth digging, but there is nothing else to it.

Considering you can end the game by trowing yourself in molten lava, that's what I felt like playing this game.

Very, very well conceived game which has lost a bit in editorial work (many power players won't like crippled market phase, but maybe there is a chance for an expansion that may fix it?). Has potential. Go on and try it!

I quite liked last year's [thing=111069][/thing] but that didn't stop this game from completely failing to show up on my radar.
The components are quite cool, but they do lead to a long setup time - with the constructing of the board and all - and I can imagine handling the production of this and getting all print poofs sorted out correctly might have been a bit of a struggle.
There is some worker placement, some area majority, some resource gathering, some engine building, some auctioning, some luck... A bit of almost everything in fact. But it works fine and most of it makes sense right away. And I quite liked it.
We did find one problem with the game though: if you're low on cash you want to be able to trade - trading spots are very limited - but you will need your resources later on, so you don't want to use them in the auction for play order. Which will probably lead to you missing out on the trading. So you have to take a significant hit in order to come back, which makes the gap with the other players bigger. I figured this out by round three and was able to come back and eventually pull of a win, but one other player stayed stuck, unwilling (unable?) to give up the precious resources to finally be able to trade. The fact that you loose whatever you bid, whatever the outcome, makes it even worse. If you do a significant bid, but end up losing the auction anyway, you still loose all money and resources bid. Awtch.
We played with 3. I can imagine this problem being less significant with 4 as there is an extra trading spot, so for now I'm willing to give this game the benefit of the doubt, as I did enjoy playing it.

rockwell - worker placement/engine building with some area control.
midweight kind of fast. not good with 2p. modular board (long setup).
multiple players mine into area with different level workers when mining threshold revealed then get a card with resource cubes (some card have negative consequences). 
player with higher worker gets more reward for each area.
subgoals which are kind of a race (eg [x] of 2 cubes).
the endgame is when majority

Unusual "Coopetition" game.  You need other people to help you, but you want to control the game.  Cool board play as well as interesting ways to accomplish various victory point goals by buying and selling.

I didn't know what to expect with this one, but liked it a lot.

The name of this game threw me. We are the head of a crew at a mining pit extracting copper, zinc, and the good stuff.  Concentric rings of excavation tiles represent layers of the pit. Worker placement. Insurance for mining accidents, bribery. Player screens hide your resources. Cool 3D artwork of the commodity exchange board. Semi cooperative making excavation checks and sharing ore if successful.

Not recommended for 2 players, the fake AI player gives whoever has "control" (first player) too much power.  The game needs 4 players to be properly balanced but playing with 4 players makes the game very long.  3 players may be an acceptable compromise between balance and game time.

The excavation mechanics force players to work together at least somewhat while trying not to help each other too much.  There are many opportunities for player interaction without any "take that" aspects and several different paths to victory, all of which seem viable. All this combines into tough choices about when to perform the different actions resulting in a friendly yet strategic game.

The buy/sell metals phase adds a lot of analysis paralysis to the game.  The vast quantity of possible strategies makes the game difficult for first-time players.

Really interesting game. Completely unique board, lovely looking 'worker placement' areas, and a ton of strategic depth. Set up is a touch laborious (though that can be fixed with decent storage of the components), but play is smooth and straight forward.

The only concern I have is how different each play of it will be. Time will tell I guess, but right now I think it's excellent.

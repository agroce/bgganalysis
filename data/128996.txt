7-14-14: We checked this out from the Dice Tower Con library on a whim for July 4th and was blown away. It was really fun as a light war game/area control team game. Almost an instant buy.

UPDATE 7-13-15: One year later, and I still love it. Great game, bumped to a 9.

RATING: 7
Gateway wargame, appealing to a wider audience so more likely to get played. It's a lot of fun, just enough strategy to reward superior planning and compensate for the wild dice rolls. It has a guerrilla-warfare feel to it - use the command decisions to retreat, only fight when the odds are overwhelmingly in your favor, but try to maintain the initiative with constant raiding.

RATING: 8
Pros:
Simple rules. Fast moving. Great dice combat (no referencing tables with modifiers). Excellent component quality. Thematic. I enjoy crushing the rebel scum!

Cons:
None!

N.B.
The system could be applied to so many other historical conflicts. I'd love to see versions covering the English Civil War, Ancient Romans and the Peloponnesian War.

I much prefer the wooden cubes over the plastic miniatures in Viking Invasions. I hope future games return to using the cubes (though miniatures for Leader units would be fine).

A really excellent two-player (at its best, play with 4!) light thematic (historical!) war game. I really enjoy the asymmetry of the combatants - and the card driven mechanics are highly thematic (albeit abstracted). The design and details are excellent. Very smooth in execution and beautiful in presentation. Enjoyable for sure!

If you like [thing=94246][/thing], you will love this one.  The mechanics are similar but the theme fits this battle.  It plays 1-4 players and I like how the method for using the French, Hessians, and Indians as auxiliary units.  High production value.  Great artwork.  Very fun light wargame.  I bet it wins some awards.

RATING: 7
A thematic and fun game that works well. There is strategy in the placement of troops and when to play certain events. The smaller deck of cards also pushes you to attack and not stay stagnant too long. Downside is the luck of dice combat (Each factions dice differ in hit % though) sometimes, as on a good or bad day can swing the game to one's side unevenly even with the best planning but other than that a fun game I do like a lot.

Cube area occupation with a good mix of good old RISK like dicing out the battles.

The twist here is that misses are used as a 'retreat' option and run-away are redeployment options. Pretty good way to bring standard tried mechanics into a historical situation. With the addition of card deck that differs with the draw, it makes the game very replayable.

Further streamlined to colony occupation (RISK continental control) does make the game look very good, plays fast and the ever dice rolling good fun.

Historical storyline in such games are as usual, dependent on the die rolls.

I am a wargamer, accustomed to rulebooks three or four times the length of 1775's. After reading these rules I did wonder if that was all there was; how could this be any more than a simple slugfest?  And yet 1775 manages to be both a tense, challenging game and not offensive to history.  In its broad brush way it highlights the critical importance of those central states between New York and Maryland, and the differing qualities of the forces.  The dice that achieve the latter also bring some wild swings of fortune/dramatic events (delete according to taste).

1775 plays quickly in wargame terms.  The truce cards combine with the variable order in which forces activate to create some real dilemmas about when to end the game and how to grab the win.  The only element that strikes a slightly bum note is the need to garrison areas with tiny forces to prevent redeployment from battles from causing the loss of control of colonies.

The board is handsome and the card art is nice. Something other than wooden cubes to represent the forces would have been good, but those cubes are functional.  Production quality is pretty decent.

A great light wargame, with plenty of War-of-Independence flavour, lots of decisions to think about, strategy and tactics. Plays very quickly, and you are very soon manoeuvring for the end game which is always lurking around the corner (though I worry end game may have a tendency to be too gamey). Want to play more.

+ Brilliant, simple game mechanic which creates lots of tough tactical decisions.
- I wonder why they didn't make the Truce-card an event card!? Now if you have only 2 events and the Truce-card in your hand you are forced to play the card for your movement and possibly lose the game.

1775 consistently produces some very exciting play from a very simple set of rules. The flavor of the different factions and the custom dice are great. Combined with the event cards and the layout of the colonies and cities, a very thematic experience emerges. The game comes alive! The variable turn order and timing of the Truce cards create a lot of tension.

Beautiful, beautiful board and components. It is easy to teach and clicks very quickly. Nice rule book and player aids. Educational, too!

RATING: 9
A lovely game. The game looks absolutely fantastic with  great quality, vintage looking map and colourful cubes (I love them and miniatures would spoil the look IMO). The rules are simple but elegant and there is true strategy in deciding how to use the very limited movement points in cards. The flow of the game is perfect with little to no downtime and games are always under two hours long. Replayability seems also great. I like the dice as it adds a degree of realistic unpredictability to the battles (of course larger and better quality armies usually win and the defender has an edge). Only small negative are the flee results as it can get quite ridicilous if a single attacker causes 4-5 defenders of a large army to flee (there should be a rule that only as much opponents can flee at a time as there are cubes in the opposing army). It also ends up in a tie too often, which is my biggest gripe about the game. But other than that, a great, elegant game with true historical feel and flavour.

4/8/17:  Praise be for games that you can explain in 15 minutes.  They are a dying breed.  Fun and short with a lot of swings.  Because it's so short I don't mind the swings.  

Looks like you want to engineer an end to the game when your side controls the last two activations, or at a minimum the last activation.  I have not yet learned how to overcome this.

Our one play was about 90 minutes of play.

Excellent wargame - strikes a good balance with easy to explain rules, historical accuracy, tension, and a bit of luck.

Normally  not a fan of "wooden cube" games, but this seems to be well balanced, and have the good components of a Euro, with the feel of a tight wargame.

This game gets high marks for design, components, theme, and accessibility but ultimately gets knocked down a peg or two for being card-driven. Unless done absolutely perfectly (Twilight Struggle, Sekigahara, Mage Knight), card-driven mechanics can feel gamey, as opposed to a good simulator of the situation on the board. 

What's absolutely wonderful about this game is that it's a solid gateway to wargaming. Wargaming NEEDS a gateway game, and I feel like between Hammer of the Scots and this, it now has its Carcassonne... That is, it isn't a Dominion or Settlers that is almost insulting in its simplicity, but can be explained fairly quickly and can be enjoyed by seasoned gamers as well as new gamers.

RATING: 8
No one could expect a 'simulation' from such a light game.  However, the rules aspect that actually simulates the era (at least for the Continentals) is the "Command Decision". . . yet this is the 'feature' that gravitates the game to euroie area control.  In turn, this makes the game suffer from AP and game length becomes an issue.  Die faces mitigate this to a degree, but the occupation forces shouldn't be able to utilize this strategy to an equal degree with the rebels & for some reason it seems they can.  Still, I love this system and would like to see more of it.  Perhaps some new action cards and scenarios to keep things fresh?

Fails to be the great game that it could have been. The truce mechanic combined with the random turn order destroyed all prior strategical planing in both of my matches.

	When it comes to historical wargames, and historical games in general, there are only a few which capture the feeling of the events of what the game is about.  1775: Rebellion is one of those games which truly encapsulates the theme and tension of a conflict such as the American Revolution.  This game is the second in the Birth of Freedom line which is published by Academy Games, a company known for their attention to detail and attention to historicity while at the same time continuing to make the game fun and engaging.  
	So what makes this game so much fun and historical?  There are multiple mechanics which aid in the theming of the game.  The first is the map itself.  The map showcases what many of the maps during the American Revolution looked like laying on the table in a war room or a map hanging in some of the halls I have seen in Williamsburg and Valley Forge.  Not only was the game board surrounding the colonies but even stretched into Canada, which did have some combat during the Revolution.  The second is the four player aspect of the game.  Many other games on the American Revolution usually deal with just a British player and an American player.  But here, in 1775, we see a player for the Continental Army, the Militia, British Redcoats and the Loyalists.  The turn order is different for every round by pulling blank dice with the color of your troops from a bag.  This gives the feel of randomness to the turn order which keeps the tension high.  This mechanic also gives the players a chance to strategize in the moment instead of planning as other wargames usually do.  For example, the loyalists could be the last player to go, but the first player to go in the next turn.  The components of the game are different but are completely thematic to the time of the war.  There are five colors of cubes used for troops: red for the redcoats, yellow for the loyalists, white for the militia, blue for the Continental Army and green for the Native Americans.  In order to use the natives, you have to be in control of the territory and the colony but they are useful in every way.  There are also two other colors which can be brought into play with cards but once eliminated are gone and cannot be brought back in for reinforcements.  They are purple for the French and orange for the Hessians.  These reinforcements for the colonists and the British give the game more theme added to a game with a heavy theme already.  
	One of the things which I really enjoyed with this game was the simplicity of combat.  There are certain wargames which use charts upon charts to figure out if there is even a line of sight for combat.  But here in this game, it is a simple roll of the dice.  That does give the game a feeling of chance, but there are also strategic maneuvers which have to be performed in order to gain the territories of the map.  Troops move around the board through a card system which is also a way in which the game can end.  Each deck has a Treaty card in it and the game can end when all four players play their treaty card.  The game can also end on round  8 and the winner is decided by how many colonies and areas of Canada are controlled by what player.
	I have introduced this game to many gamers and historians who could not stop praising this game.  I believe this game should be used in the classroom when teaching the American Revolution not only in the public school level but the university level as well.  Once again, Academy Games has proven that they can produce a game which is both enjoyable and educational.

I am playing this with my game club, the same group that loved 1812: the Invasion of Canada.  If I write a review of it for BGG, I might have to title it:

MY DEAD GRAM LIKES IT; AND SHE'S NOT EVEN ALIVE!!!!!!!

Though I think this game is a ten, I also think, as with 1812, that some of the reviewers have lost either their perspectives, or their minds, take your pick.  Do not be fooled by the following review comments:

"The quality of the cards is outstanding."

The cards, though colourful, are not outstanding.  They are flimsy and fragile and need to be placed into sleeves as soon as possible.

"The box insert is also worth noting. It is designed to either be kept as is in the box to hold all the factions components and draw bags separately or it can be broken apart by the perforations to be given to the faction players as a holder during the game. It's a great insert and just another example of the time and effort that went into the game."

Yes and no.  Yes, the fact that Academy Games took the time and expense to include a box insert is worth noting. But do not place the baggies back under the sink just yet.  The no comes from the fact that the insert will not work as a storage container if you plan to go vertical with your box.

RATING: 8.5
Light game with a war theme.

Those looking for a hardcore wargame of the events that happened in 1775 will not find it here BUT you will find a very good game with a theme attached to it. 

Also ... 1775 has to be played a few times before you see it has more under the hood than you first thought... Dice are tuned according to Nationality. You have the British that include highly trained units and so they are far more important than other armies. You could say that 1775 is a COIN very light that can be played by anybody, but only the good players will win.

Thanks to the Steam PC/iPad version the game can now be played in solo mode or on line and there it shows its true (great) nature. Because computer play shows very rapidly the weak points in a design through repeated play ... and 1775 stood this test brilliantly. Just like Ticket to Ride you can play this game many times and still have fun. 

Great compliments to Academy Games to have come up with a light wargame for eurogamers with a high entertainment value. 

Production value is through the roof too. Upped to 8.5 tx to the AI play launched in October 2016.

This is a fun diversion.  I like that it is so easy, I just pulled it out,set it up and played to completion in 1 hour without consulting the rulebook.  OTOH, it is pretty random, has little relation to war (I can't call it a wargame) and isn't very challenging.  So perfect social game, or filler, but not a great sense of accomplishment either.

Played a demo copy at Origins 2012 with Uwe's daughter, son's girlfriend, and his friend. We played 2v2. I think I enjoy this over 1812.  The biggest differences from 1812 were:

1)area is controlled by entire state not area. Most states are several areas and must not have any opponent pieces in the state to control it. A real twist from 1812.

2) The Native Indians are neutral and can be picked up by either side.

3) Units can be recruited only in controlled states within a city location.

4) A new strategy is using the sea movement along the coastline which can really surprise you in how far you can travel. I think this is a slight step up in complexity.

Academy Games does the American Revolution in a similar fashion to their "1812: the Invasion of Canada," this time as a four player game with cards to afford either side German, French or Indian allies. Each faction has their own tailored combat dice (very cool combat system). The game has surprising depth while being very simple to teach and play. A Risk/A&A variant with oodles of theme particular to the period. If you enjoyed 1812, you will love this release as it continues the system making it even more elegant. Highly recommended as a fast paced beer & pretzels game (if that's what you are in the mood for) or as a gateway to more involved multi-player games of strategy. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Love the rules.  Very elegant with a feel for the period.
The British regulars, Hessians, and French are deadly, the Continentals are solid, the Loyalist and Patriot Militias are undependable, but still essential.  The Native Americans are extremely useful, but very undependable in a battle.
Despite the differences in the troop types, they all have a role to play.  Sometimes it's in your best interest to target the lesser troops in battle to take dice out of your opponent's hand.  This leads to delicious agony as you really want to hit the better troops for the long-term impact, but you also want to win the battle, so you may have to target the lesser troops first.
The defender firing first means that you really have to attack with a very large superiority to ensure a victory...and even then there can be upset victories.

A very light wargame.  No terrain modifiers, one type of unit, no supply lines, etc, etc.

However, there's definitely some strategy here.  There's randomness for sure -- dice (which I never like) and player card decks, but there's room to learn basic strategies like concentration of forces and centers of gravity.  

It's light and fun and I enjoy playing it with my son.

Juego "de toñas" ambientado en la guerra de la independecia americana. Hay dos bandos: Los americanos y los ingleses. El objetivo es ser el bando que controle más territorios o provincias al finalizar la partida. Esto ocurre al llegar al turno 8, o cuando uno de los bando ha jugado su segunda carta de tregua.

Tiene un motor de cartas. Cada jugador dispone de tres cartas que permiten el movimiento de los ejércitos y ejecutar determinados eventos. 

El sistema de batalla es curioso. LAs fuerzas de los ejércitos están  balanceadas conforme al uso de unos dados diferentes para cada tipo de ejército. Del lado de los americanos están el ejercito continental y los patriotas, y del lado de los ingleses, el ejército inglés y los lealistas. También aparecen en el juego holandeses, franceses e indios. 

Es un juego muy sencillo y rápido. Tiene bastante azar, porque hay una lluvia constante de dados, pero resulta muy entretenido. 

Recomendable y apto para no jugones. No dura mucho.

One of my favorite board games/wargames. I prefer to play it with 2 persons, or solo. Tried it with 4 and it was like playing doubles tennis -- too much banter and alpha leader dynamics. 

This game has replay value. It's easy to teach. Even non-wargamers seem to enjoy it. Provides a nice feel for the history of the period. Plays relatively quickly. Thus, makes a good addition to any gaming collection imo.

They are as strong as the British, and they have a similar effect upon arrival in the game to that of Scipio appearing in the Hannibal. Our first game was long - three and a half hours, which also skews the initial rating due to length. Not different enough from 1812, save for the map, to warrant its inclusion to the collection. UPDATE: Second game I played Americans, the French cards never came into play. Lost 6 - 4.

Wargame-lite (or advanced Risk). I enjoyed my only play so much that I decided to get a copy for the club. It plays fast enough to use as game night opener or closer.

1st play, solo, intro scenario.

Rules are clearly explained and easy to comprehend. What to do with fled Native Americans and Hessians and what to do with your deck once it is exhausted were not immediately obvious to me- certain cards govern the inclusion of both factions back into play and no, you don't reshuffle. Good looking map and fine quality components.

Being a first play, don't have much insight into the game-play. A blend of area control and resource management. Need to use your troops to expand as well as protect your turf. You'll only use each card from your deck once so the timing of its use appears to be important. Quick pace and tactical, not much mucking about.

Very fun, light little wargame. I love how the dice "behave" differently depending on the kind of units you have, and I found the game to be quite balanced. I'm not crazy about the turn-order mechanic, in which it is possible to give one player four turns in a row (which would all but hand them victory), but that is very unlikely, and as long as player turns are relatively evenly spaced apart, games can be very close. Native Americans are great to have as allies, but are a pain to get to and can be easily handed over to your enemy once lost. Smaller territories are easier to take but also relatively easy to defend. I am not a wargamer, but this is one of my favorite "dudes on a map-style" games.

Highly luck dependent on the card draws.  You have a small hand of three cards and each card does on thing, and no reshuffle. Card plays are obvious and requires little critical thinking.

The design of the card draw/play system seems so dated compared to a modern design like Hannibal.  Hannibal has three different ways you can use card, move general, use event, or buy troops, you also get a big hand and you will go through the deck multiple times.   All these mechanics make the card draw/play strategic.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The best iteration of Risk to date. It's difficult (I think) to truly dominate the board--those fled units just keep coming back and even small territories can be tough to hold. And because either player may be able to end the game early, timing is crucial.

If you like Risk, probably a great game for you, but I found the cards repetitive, and the game not so interesting. Ive played the game about 30 times and I just cant seem to get into it. I will say the people I played with were fairly competititve players, but I never felt a real sense of the AWI kicking in other than the map is beautiful, and the artwork is nice too. 
This is a great intro level game for people not so much into history, I think if the card deck was twice as big as it was I think the game would work better for me.

RATING: 7
This is my 600th rating!! Woo!!!!!!!

This is a really nice, tight combat game. And for a light game, it has a satisfactory amount of genuinely tough decisions. The placement of your units at the beginning of each turn is always a tough choice - especially thanks to the unknown, fluctuating turn order.

And I do really like the turn order mechanic. It forces you to make some interesting tactical responses, and it definitely adds drama! Yeah, it can feel bad when the other side gets four turns in a row so it can lead to imbalance but in a game of this weight that lasts a smooth 90 minutes, I'm totally fine with that. 

Especially since there's a lot that's been done to make losses not feel so bad. Really, the turn order is a bigger deal than rolling poorly during combat. You get so many units back a turn... the whole game is just one side pushing the other, then the underdog making a grand comeback. It's fun and dramatic and just feels good. It's the joy of constructing some really clever play and then seeing if you pull it off when you add in the uncertainty of dice - something I'm not [i]always[/i] a fan of but again, it just works here.

Update: Have now tried this with both 2 and 4 players. Works great both ways! This is one of the better team combat games I've played since your units are distinct, and you have some agency if you and your partner disagree (i.e., you can drag their units along kicking and screaming). Good stuff all around.

RATING: N/A
A very fun game.  Definitely on the lighter side in many respects, but there is still quite a bit of strategy involved.  The 4-player version is quite interesting, as the management of available resources becomes crucial to the decisions you make.  The outcome of the game was constantly in doubt for most of the time.  I don't see myself getting this game, but I would definitely enjoy playing it again.

RATING: 7
I always liked the idea and fun of Risk, while acknowledging it blows as a game. I think this game is the update I have been looking for. There is still a lot of luck in how the cards come out, and with the die rolls. But there is also some good tactical decision making and long-term strategy, but the rules are simple enough for casual players.

The board is in constant flux (I really like the way the desertion works, and the 'recruitment' of natives), and there are tons of skirmishes happening all over the board. The board layout is interesting - do the revolutionaries make a play for the South, take New York and move to Canada, operate from the middle and go for NJ, DE and PA? A lot can depend on where the French and Hessians are, and if you have any sea movement cards. 

It can be annoying and crippling if you are not drawing events, but the game plays fast (I can not imagine taking much longer that 90 minutes) so it isn't much bother. I have not tried the 4 player version, and it should work fine as long as partners can NOT discuss strategy and have an Alpha player ruin the game. Good stuff.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

This is a great game! Incredible fun for 2-players, and even more fun with 4 because of the way your teammate can command your troops in their turn. Makes for some interesting arguments over strategy. :)

RATING: 8
Light wargame. I like the partnership play with 4 players. I am also impressed with the dice mechanic which does a good job balancing the effectiveness of the regulars/allies (more reliable but less dice) with the loyalists/patriots (less reliable but more dice). Having units flee but come back as reinforcements works well as does needing to control a colony to be able to place units there. The command decision action is also very useful for tactically re-positioning your forces. 

The end often feels like a cheap win or an unfair loss depending on your point of view. A side that gets the last two turns (or even the last turn) of a round once both players have their relatively powerful truce cards often wins as they no longer need to worry about defence and can throw everyone into battle.

In my opinion the game is better than 1812 as the action isn't centred around a couple of choke points between the USA and Canada but can occur almost anywhere thanks to the 2 and 3 space movement cards and the powerful naval cards. Over a dozen games.

The two player game is surprisingly fun and well balanced with very few rule changes. Recommended.

Only two or three plays of 1812 were sufficient to convince me to pick this one up. And after playing 1775, I really can't say which one I like better. I was expecting to have a favorite and trade the other, but I'm not ready to pull the trigger on that decision.

1775 is the game I would have wanted Risk to be. It's dudes on a map, dice chucking, and plenty of back and forth, but in a beautiful package that anyone would be proud to have displayed on their coffee table. The dice and the turn order produce some wild swings of fortune, but there's also enough decision making to keep things very interesting.

I love this design and look forward to playing more.

So despite my first go at this game being kind of a disaster, I impulsively decided to try the iPad version and try and discern what all the fuss is about. Lots of gamers with taste think this is excellent, and it's constantly being recommended as a first entry into historical wargaming. So, what the heck, I'll try it out in the privacy of my own home and see what I missed out on, right?

Err. I can't say it helped all that much. Sorry everyone.

I harped on my problems with the team play aspect in my first review, which was partly an artifact of my first go at the game being 2v2 and taking way too long because of it, in part because one of the players was constantly leaving the table and everyone spending way too much time kibbitzing, but my original assessment stands, far as I'm concerned: the fundamental issue with 1775 as a team game is that there is no particular asymmetry or divergent goals between the two allied players and thus no reason for the game to either break down to one dominant player quarterbacking his team or both players asserting themselves and butting heads the entire time. It's thus either boring and annoying for the non-QB player or boring and annoying for the members of the opposite team.

Team dynamics [i]can[/i] work in games of this sort -- I'm a fan of Fire in the Lake and The Napoleonic Wars which both force players into a certain degree of cooperation with their allies while at the same time giving them both the means and the motive to go their own way as the situation dictates, because they are ultimately working towards their own goals. 1775 is only a team game insofar as any fundamentally one-on-one wargame [i]could[/i] be a team game.

As a 1v1 experience, it's a bit better I suppose, and I will certainly give it the thumbs-up as a more interesting and much quicker alternative to playing a two-player game of Risk. The rules are straightforward and elegantly presented, the game looks nice on the table, and if everyone's getting involved, the whole thing is over and done with in 60-90 minutes, maybe even less.

BUT here's the other thing that sticks in my craw about 1775: it's just not a Revolutionary War game, packaging aside. The initial setup of the game bears little resemblance to the Revolution, the dynamics and the troop movements don't feel like the Revolution, you don't face anything like the command decisions the leaders in that war faced, and a typical game bears little if any resemblance to the actual conflict.

If you want a simple wargame that looks great and plays quickly, I would recommend Sekigahara over this in a heartbeat. If you want a game of the American Revolution that's still pretty easy to learn (albeit a bit tougher than 1775, get Washington's War instead. If you don't mind a ramp up in complexity and time commitment and want to explore the Revolution with some real multi-player dynamics -- well, I haven't played Liberty or Death yet, but I'm a fan of the COIN series overall.

Academy has coupled top drawer components with historical flavor and great team play.  It's easy learn and you learn a lot about the War for American Independence while doing so.

Totally functional mind you, just not very cool or revolutionary :)

Big fan of this series. 1775 improves the already great game and mechanics of 1812 by adding subtle nuances in all the right places.  From the Native Americans to how allied nations are brought in to the colony region set up, this is truly a blast to play.

When I was first getting into this hobby, one game that pushed me into the realm of designer board games was Risk. Now I'm not saying Risk is a designer board game, but was a game that did lay some stepping stones to start my journey. I had acquired several games before 1775 and always tried to get that one game which gave me the feeling of Risk. Without being Risk. 1775 does that for me. It's of course on a much smaller scale, but there's an end in sight.

RATING: 6
Solid area control card-driven beginner's wargame. It works well, has tension and tactical considerations associated with where reinforcements enter the game and the fleeing and battle movement (command decision). Like all card-driven games, you need to know the decks to play well, but they are small so that's not a big hurdle. Also, the game has excellent components and art. 

Where it failed for me is the amount of luck associated with the turn order (a side can have maximum 4 turns in a row), which in such a frantic push-pull game can decide the winner. Even worse, the usual tactic of denying region control with a lonely faraway cube, is even more prone to luck, since the resulting Hail Mary last turn single cube chase usually gets decided by a d6 roll. Overall, quite an unstable and swingy tit-for-tat area control affair, such that I generally dislike.

I would play this, but not something I need to own.

Easy to learn, fun to play, but also a game in which many different strategies can be used.

Really enjoyed my one play of this, but had such a hard getting it to the table with my usual groups that I passed it on.

The rules are super-simple, but the game felt deep - the difference between the three main types of dice (Redcoat/French, Continental/Hessians, Militia/Partisans) is incredibly relevant; the reinforcement and control rules play together to form a nicely strategic landscape; and the movement limitations - no picking up or dropping off units along the way - favor large armies and do a lovely job making you feel the difficulty of fighting over the larger states.

More of an abstract area control game with an historical theme than an actual wargame, neverthless a fun, relatively light, game of the American Revolution. Best part: incorporation of the activation methods used in many tactical (but rarely strategic) wargames will, I think, go a long way toward preventing the game from growing stale despite limited card variety. Weakest part: too symmetric; I mentally groaned when, as the Continentals, I discovered I had the same naval lift capacity as the British. I’ll try to sell a non-historical gamer family member on giving it a try.

Very nice components, easily understood rules, quick set up. Three extra cubes of each color are thoughtfully provided, reducing component attrition anxiety.

RATING: 10
2-4

Voorbereiding :

1/ Elke speler kiest een factie met de corresponderende eenheden, gevechtsdobbelstenen en kaarten.
2/ Plaats de starteenheden op het speelbord (zie gekleurde vierkantjes op het bord)
3/ Plaats de vlaggen: Britse vlag op Delaware, Quebec en Nova Scotia. Amerikaanse vlag op Connecticut en Rhode Island.
4/ Trek willekeurig een beurtvolgorde-marker. Elke factie van die kleur plaatst 4 bijkomende eenheden in gebieden die ze bezetten. Daarna doet de andere factie net hetzelfde.
5/ Niet gebruikte eenheden gaan naar de Reinforcement Stockpile van elke speler.
6/ De speler schudden hun deck (kaarten 0-12) en nemen 3 kaarten op hand.
7/ Plaats de rondemarker op plaats 1 van het rondespoor.
Het spel wordt gespeeld over x-aantal ronden. Tijdens elke ronde, komen de 4 facties aan beurt in willekeurige volgorde.

Een ronde verloopt als volgt:

1/ Trek een beurtvolgorde marker om de actieve speler te bepalen. Plaats de marker op het beurtvolgordespoor. 
Als de zak leeg is, ga naar 3/

2/ Actieve speler:

2.1/ Reinforcements:

Neem 4 eenheden van de Reinforcement Stockpile en al je eenheden die zich in de plaats met de Fled Units bevinden. Plaats deze eenheden in gebieden die jij controleert.

Controle: minstens één eenheid van jouw factie en geen enkele vijandige of neutrale eenheid is aanwezig.

Native Americans: Wanneer Native Americans alleen in een gebied staan, wordt dat gebied als neutraal gezien. Wanneer Britse of Amerikaanse eenheden in dat gebied trekken, worden de neutrale Native Americans Britten of Amerikanen. Wanneer de Britten of Amerikanen het gebied verlaten, worden de Native Americans opnieuw neutraal.

2.2/ Movement:

Je moet 1 movement kaart spelen (Truce kaarten inbegrepen).

Je mag aanvullend nog maximum 2 event kaarten spelen.
Legers bestaan uit 1 of meer eenheden. Legers kunnen worden gevormd met facties en geallieerden van dezelfde kant. Je kan alle of een paar eenheden verplaatsen, maar je moet minstens 1 eenheid verplaatsen.

Het aantal soldaten op een movement kaart bepaalt het maximum aantal legers dat mag bewegen, gevolgd door het aantal gebieden waarover al die legers mogen bewegen. Legers worden verplaatst van gebied tot gebied. 

Water movement kaarten laten legers toe om te verplaatsen van een land (aangrenzend aan zee) naar om het even welk land (aangrenzend aan dezelfde zee). 

Een leger moet stoppen wanneer het in een gebied terecht komt waar vijandelijke of neutrale (Native Americans) aanwezig zijn. Een leger kan tijdens een beurt slechts 1 keer worden verplaatst.

Uitgespeelde kaarten gaan naar de aflegstapel, behalve Truce kaarten. Truce kaarten worden face-up naast het speelbord gelegd.  

2.3/ Battle:

Een gevecht vindt plaats wanneer twee vijandige legers in hetzelfde gebied staan. 

Wanneer er meerdere gevechten zijn, kiest de actieve speler welk gevecht als eerste wordt afgehandeld. Er kunnen eventueel nog event kaarten worden gespeeld voordat het gevecht start.

Elke factie rolt evenveel dobbelstenen als het aantal eenheden in het gebied.

Verdedigers rollen als eerste de dobbelstenen.

HIT: per “hit”-symbool moet het slachtoffer 1 van zijn eenheden naar zijn Reinforcement Stockpile plaatsen (het slachtoffer kiest welke eenheid).

FLEE: per “flee”-symbool mag het slachtoffer 1 van zijn eenheden (met het corresponderende kleur) naar de Fled Units plek verplaatsen.

BLANCO: per blanco-symbool mag het slachtoffer 1 van zijn eenheden uit het gevecht terugtrekken. Deze eenheid mag verplaatst worden naar een aangrenzend gebied waar geen vijandelijke eenheden staan. De blanco dobbelsteen wordt steeds als laatste bekeken.

Als er na het gevecht nog steeds twee vijandelijke legers in het gebied staan, is het de beurt aan de aanvaller. Daarna opnieuw aan de verdediger, enz. Tot er één factie in het gebied overblijft.

2.4/ Draw:

Trek kaarten tot je 3 kaarten hebt.

Als je geen movement kaarten hebt, toon je je hand, schud je je drie kaarten in de deck en trek je 3 nieuwe kaarten.

Ga nu terug naar 1/

3/ Einde van het spel:

Ronde 1 of 2: de ronde eindigt. Verplaats de rondeteller. Steek de beurtvolgorde-markers terug in de zak en ga terug naar 1/. 

Ronde 3: kijk of alle Truce kaarten van 1 van beide facties zijn gespeeld. 

Zo nee: de ronde eindigt. Verplaats de rondeteller. Steek de beurtvolgorde-markers terug in de zak en ga terug naar 1/.

Zo ja: ga naar 4/.

4/ Winnaar

De factie die de meeste gebieden controleert is de winnaar.

I can't tell how much depth this game has after only a single play, but it feels as if the tactics would hold up.  My biggest gripe with the game is that it's not nearly as short as it advertises.  It is beneficial to put real thought into the placement of each cube and this means that a slower game produces stronger results.  Taking a long time to play this game seems at odds with the goal of a light conflict sim.

Players refight the American War of Independance as either a member of the Patriots or Loyalists factions.  Very simple mechanically - play a card, place some cubes, move some troops, throw some dice.  However the sum here is much greater than the parts, and results in a beautiful and fun game to play.  Excellent game.

I was excited to get 1775 to the table and have really enjoyed playing it as a 2 player and a 3 player game.  I enjoy the card play and the area majority focus of the game.  My only concern is that like a number of other area majority games there does seem to be an advantage to whoever goes last.

Best with 2 or 4.

This game is fantastic. You can teach it to someone in five minutes, which would usually mean it must be easy and too simple. True, the rules are simple, however, the gameplay is very thought provoking and extremely strategic. You will find yourself stressing over where to place reinforcements and where to attack with your limited moves. 
I would highly recommend this game, it is great with 2 players and it is even more fun with 4 players.

After a few plays of the starter scenario, we finally go to play the proper game. The treaty cards came out a lot faster than I expected. Given how you can be forced to play the treaty cards, it adds a race element where you need to be sure you're always within range of victory, or else risk a more strategic buildup.
Update: I've moved my rating up a half-point, since my eldest just loves this game, even though he has always lost against me. His game keeps progressing, little by little, and I certainly am not dumbing my game down for him. It'll be a great day when he finally gets the upper hand!

Light wargame.  Each type of unit has it's own battle dice which leads to some interesting decision when grouping units and deciding where to take the losses.    Luck of draw on turn order and on critical battles seems to have a large impact on who wins, so that lowers the rating for me.

A very nice follow-up to the surprisingly good 1812 game.  The changes in this game make sense in the context of the AmRev conflict and seem to add a bit more chaos to the system.  Certainly not a consim, but a pleasant game with enough historically flavor to maintain the narrative of the AmRev.

Academy Games is really making some wonderful intro level war games in their Birth of America Series.  High Quality in every aspect from design to presentation. 

Right now an 8 but can see easily rising.

My favorite area control game so far.  It plays quickly but has plenty of interesting probability-based tactical decisions and a theme that works perfectly with the system of controlling armies composed of multiple factions. I love playing this one with my son and hope to play it in a larger family session soon.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The theme actually carries through to the gameplay, which is easy to pick up. The dice, being different for each faction, help to convey somewhat abstracted historical abilities of the forces that fought. The mapboard is very nicely made. On a personal note, even though armies are represented by cubes, it doesn't bother me, and helps to move units easily around- no need for minis. There is some Risk-like feel to the game, but with the card play, different dice and variable turn order, the game is certainly elevated above any Risk-type category.

Good lite card driven wargame - plays very much like it's older sibling 1812 with a couple of minor tweaks to reflect the very fluid nature of the "front" in this war which shifted constantly. A sign of a solid base game system when just minor changes are able to effectively simulate significant tactical nuances of the period.

All the bits are excellent, the rules are very clear - wish it had minis!

Our only negatives are that the static set-up limits replayability and some of cards can be more or less impactful depending on if they come out earlier or later in the game - a bit more swingy than 1812.

Gen Con 2013 purchase.  Very glad I picked this one up.  After playing, I like it a little better than 1812.  The map is certainly better.  The gameplay is fast (well, for everyone but me...) with little downtime.  I played a 4-player game and enjoyed the back and forth struggle for control of the colonies, disruption of plans and surprise moves.  The battles are fun to resolve and can yield some interesting results.  With each "faction" having its own unique combat dice, the battle outcomes are quite believable.  Quality is outstanding and Academy has another winner in my book.

This game is thematically sound, even while using a great bit of Euro-abstraction (cube-pushing). But because of its Euro nature, it provides a compelling amount of tension in a relatively simple ruleset. The thematic elements come to life, for example, when Benedict Arnold changes a Continental Army (a blue cube) into a Redcoat Army (a red cube), or when Betsy Ross causes all fleeing British loyalists to become patriots.

It's as if El Grande were combined with a war game. I wouldn't call this a wargame per se (at least not according to a grognard definition), but it's a beautiful, masterfully done area control simulation with a narrative that makes it so very interesting. Moved this up from an 8 to a 9 on my ratings.

It’s the team play which appeals to me and my cardboard squddies.  The gameplay is simple enough to allow the focus of the talk to be about strategy and tactics.  There are two issues that we are grappling with.  The first is that, my partner and I were defeated from a winning position when our opponents were able to ‘flip-flop’ and play their treaty cards.  This has left me wondering if Lady Luck has more influence in the outcome than I would want.  However, perhaps we should have anticipated this possibility and played accordingly.  The other issue - we all want to play the redcoats and give the ungrateful colonists and their French lackeys a good thumping.  We should up the ante and get some Yankees to the table.

RATING: 8
1775 is drab looking and easy to pass on the shelf, but if you do, you'll miss out on an incredible wargame. Approachable yet strategic, 1775 has a card action system where armies play one card per turn. That is the action, and turns happen quickly with satisfaction. Additionally, the unique turn order mechanic is refreshing and welcome. It is relaxing but also full of excitement discovering who will move next. This a hard sell with the stigma of wargames, but rest-assured, 1775 should hit the table.

RATING: 6
The give and take (or capture and recapture) provides a strategic feel that I believe provides players with a sense of how the war actually went... various thrusts and parries that often end up inconclusive. What most other commentators don't mention is the resource allocation dimension of game decisions: which sectors to deploy forces and whether to use offensively, defensively or redeploy. The result is that it feels like there are just too many gaps to cover and control of any given area is tenuous.

The game does have a bit of last turn / game ending distortion, such as happens in other games where player(s) can make moves that would be unlikely and/or unsustainable, knowing that there will be no counter attack, etc. The truce card mechanism is somewhat helpful in this, but the faction going last in turn (especially if both factions of same side do) has a significant opportunity for unsustainable stretch to win without threat of response.

Another aspect that is disappointing is the lack of attrition. A major factor in the war was dealing with militia force erosion and winter losses. The game does not have that and forces stay in areas indefinitely. Works for the game system but not satisfactory from a historical perspective.

I call this type of strategy game a wrestling game because as you thrust, you are giving something up.  Your hoping to pin two arms with your one in hopes of using he free hand to do damage.

Now, I would characterize this game more of a knife fight. Quick and deadly, if you get cut, you better make sure you cut them just as deep.

Great game. Lots of action and thinking. Even if one side starts doing well, the other side can come back. If there is quick victory, then you can start quickly again.

As it is the game is pretty much broken. As many reviewers state, the random turn order will be too much of an advantage for the last players. Because in a turn you can usually swing between 1-3 VP, that means you will win the game if by chance you & your allie go last in the last round.

I don't understand why they even put random turn oder in there.. the game has enough luck in it as it is. Also the cubes didn't invite me to immerse myself into the theme. It pretty much felt like a slightly improved risk..
But if one fixes the turn order problematic (e.g. random but one side after another) it is an enjoyable, very light "wargame".

To tell you the truth i just expected more & i love the Conflict of Heroes Series from Academy Games & i'm not really a friend of CDGs, so take my rating with a grain of salt.

This is by far the best wargame I own and this is coming from someone who grew up on A&A. After multiple late-nights playing the Global A&A version, my roommate wondered if there was a version set during the Revolutionary Era. I did some research and stumbled upon this gem, which I immediately ordered...and I'm glad I did! Within no time, we cleared off the A&A games and had this set up in the study, full time. It's fast, fun and easy to learn all-the-while challenging to master the end objectives with fleeing victims and deciding whether to retreat or stay in the fight. Unlike A&A or Risk, this game treats allied units as a whole army rather than individual units, which makes for a wargame where I can (finally) attack with combined arms. There is too much to like about this game. I've even sold my father and young sister on this game and after reading a comment about it being a wargame for those who aren't fond of them, I can safely say that it's true! Any gamer will love this. Must own!

I really wanted to like this one more than 1812 but I'm afraid it doesn't compare well to me.  For a light game, 1812 is much tighter with the national boundary and the reinforcement zones.  In 1775, armies spring up out of whole cloth too easily and retreat forward too easily.  In retrospect, the system probably is a bad match for a Rebellion and works best with a national border.

Really, the game play has little or nothing to do with the American Revolution.  It is a clever enough system re-themed and labelled as being about the American Revolution.  None of the key aspects of the conflict are duplicated here.

RATING: 8
Improves upon its parent game 1812 by starting the action immediately and through the extra level of control of the states/provinces, but keeps the speed and simplicity of play.

Only negative is the critical significance of going last on the final turn - it's a massive advantage. Doesn't stop it being fun, but in a close game the side whose cube comes out of the bag last is likely to win.

Saw it at ORIGINS 2013 but didn't get a chance to play it. I did demo it's sister game 1812 and loved it, the instructor also told us of the differences and similarities of the 2 games. Hope this wins an award for most innovative War Game. *Update: Shelly bought this for me at GenCon as it just refuses to go into general release. Purchased 8/22/13.

Game is a lot of fun.  Simple to learn, and I personally like the historical/educational aspect of it.  There is enough strategy to make it engrossing and pass time seamlessly.  I like playing it, and will play it several more times. 

That being said, the battle mechanic is a little too luck driven for my taste.  Armies fleeing based on chance seems askew.  The fact that you don't have to control colonies, but just make sure that your opponent doesn't control them by battling them and then terminating the game with truce cards if the option arises seem like a flaw in the system.  Once again though, more going for it than not.

* Kickstarted! *

Determine who controls North America as either the British or the Americans with 2-4 players... but 7 armies. The game improves on the reinforcements model of 1812 and the game really shifts from turn to turn, making each move strategic. If you like history or are looking for a different type of war game, then this is definitely the game for you.

PLUS: improvement over the 1812 model.
BIG PLUS: the dice can send soldiers fleeing back to base, making an overwhelming army less predictable.
BIG MINUS: not enough dice, especially when both sides have natives working with them.

RATING: 8
Not deep or a great simulation of the Revolutionary War, but one heck of a fun game.  Enough dice rolling and card play (and bluffing) to keep the other side guessing.  I'm not positive, but I'm pretty sure there's no perfect strategy with this one, but there are definitely thing players can do that will greatly improve their chances of winning.  Highly recommended.

If two players are fairly equal, it will come down to whether or not one side has the cards to end the game early or not.  It's all about when the game ends.  Not quite what I am looking for in a war game.  It is an ok introduction to war games for newbies.  With variance in the strength of the cards makes the game just a little too random for my liking.

Read the rules. The game looks fantastic! The 1812 rules are tweaked in several places making this game unique. Of course the map is different but there are significant changes to the makeup of each side. There are two unit types for each side, and the Native Americans are neutral and will fight for whoever shares an area with them first.

Your ability to add reinforcements do not just depend on controlling a single area. Instead you must control an entire colony which is subdivided into several areas.

In a battle the defending army always rolls first!

I think this might be the best of the Birth of America series.  The initial situation is much more interesting than 1812 or 1754 and the mechanics seem to be a better fit for the war.  Both sides have the same number of total combat dice, which is very important after the one-sided slog that was 1812.

My one source of irritation is the interaction between the map and the victory conditions - by making some colonies just 1-2 spaces, they take on an over-sized role in the victory conditions.  New Jersey & Delaware are both significantly better colonies to take and hold than New York (which is nearly impossible to retain control of).  This is more of an issue from a historical perspective than a gameplay one.

What to say. This is probably my favorite Risk style experience ever. Sure, it's a dice game with a heavy luck factor and turn order randomizing benefiting whoever happens to go last. It's also a four player team game and a kind of a tug-of-war. The card play, troop mustering rules, fleeing units and possibility to maneuver on the battlefield make it very interesting and even if it takes two hours it doesn't feel like that long. Besides Risk it also reminds me of Quartermaster General due to the card play and team aspect. In the end there's mental exhaustion no matter on which side of the dice you end up being.

I will be the first to admit that I tend to not give out the highest ratings on games but 1775 fits that gaming sweet spot of light wargame matched with multi team partner fun.  based off its sister game of 1812 (from two to five players) 1775 gives IMHO a greater range of options for each player to execute - In part because unit reinforcement is similar for both sides in quantity, but drastically different from game to game on placement based on what happens in the game 

To place newly raised and fled units, on a city, you much first have control of the colony - which is gained when enemy units and neutral Indians are no longer in the colony

control of colonies are critical because even one enemy cube in your colony breaks control, and the way to win is have control over the greatest number of colonies.

COMBAT
Combat is a very straight up system. The defender fires first using up to two or three dice depending what is being represented. This is a maximum, so if you bring in 10 Colonial Army troops you will still only fire two dice at a time. So, Diversification of an army is critical because if that same army hd two CA regulars, three Rebel units, to native Americans, and two Frogs allows NINE dice to be rolled over two

And then the system represents the various capabilities of the unit GOIN UP OR DOWN IN CAPABILITIES DEPENDING HOW GOOD THEY WERE. Results are hit - where you kill an enemy, command decision alloys you to move away from THIS battle, and fee, temporarily removed  fro the board.

Combine this with at most an eight turn card driven game where the each turn you play one movement card and you get a pretty fast little game!!!!!

Highly recommend. 20 minutes to playing, and at most 90 minutes

After one play i am a bit uncertain on whether i like the end game condition combined with the random turn order. The idea is very interesting, but it might be a bit too powerful to get two turns in a row at the end of a round, combined with the very strong maneuvers that are on the truce cards. Also i don't like the fact that you can be forced to play it.

A very interesting area control game where, best played with 4, each player controls a certain faction or army. there are 2 teams. Redcoats and their loyalists vs. the Continental Army and their Militia. In order to win, a team must control the most colonies after a few simple conditions are met, however, attaining those conditions are not very easy. While the game's rules seem heavy, its a rather light/medium strategy game. It has the feel of Risk but IMO a better game.

First off: don't let the game's appearance (including the cover illustration) fool you: this is [b]not[/b] a complicated, lengthy and dry wargame.

[b]1775: Rebellion[/b] offers a lot: surprisingly easy rules (11-page rulebook with 5 pages of actual rules), strategic depth, great components, a balanced asymmetry between both conflicting sides and overall clever design decisions in all areas. The game also strikes a very enjoyable balance between strategy and luck.

The scalability for 2-4 players works really well: each side (British/American) is divided into 2 factions (British Redcoats + German Hessian Mercenaries against Continental Army + Patriot Militia), meaning that in a full 4-player game [b]1775: Rebellion[/b] plays 2 versus 2 players. Playing with less people (2-3) requires one or two players taking control of both factions from their side, which is very manageable and easy to handle.

While the artworks and map look great, some people dislike using wooden cubes instead of miniatures, but I personally like the simplistic look and better overview they provide, plus it keeps the game's price reasonable. The board itself is big (95 × 48 cm) and looks great on the table, but some players might miss a scoring track. The custom dice are high-quality, big (:arrowE: easy to read across the table) and increases the asymmetric and strategic depth, as each faction has its own set of dice which are purposely limited in different numbers.

The way the game ends also deserves to be mentioned, as the concept of played out truce cards is fresh, adds strategic depth and feels very thematic, because players are taking on the roles of commanding generals, not politicians.

[b]1775: Rebellion[/b] is not a game without flaws (in detail) though: the map does look great on the big board, but because the map uses a realistic scale, smaller areas (near the coast) tend to be overcrowded with cubes.
The game also has one potential big balance issue when taking a closer look at how the game determines player turn order over one round: turn order between the 4 factions is determined by randomly drawing 1 faction-coloured cube from a bag and let the corresponding player have his/her turn. After all 4 cubes are eventually drawn during one round, they are then shuffled back into the bag and the process begins again with a new round and a bag full of 4 cubes.
The potential big problem here is, that 1 side (British or US) can end up having 4 consecutive turns (last 2 turns of the current round + first 2 turns of the next round), which can completely demolishing the opponent(s). One simply house rule I use the solve this problem is: if 2 cubes from the same side are drawn last during a round, only shuffle the 2 cubes from the other faction in the bag, draw 1 randomly and [i]then[/i] add the other 2. This way, any potential 4-turn-chain for one side is immediately broken with the start of a new round.

[b]1775: Rebellion[/b] is one of the most-streamlined games I have ever played, especially inside the strategy game genre, thanks to the easy cardplay, the intuitive and clever use of the custom dice or details like the printed-on setup instructions on the board for a very fast setup.

It is a very accessible strategy wargame which can also appeal to people who don't usually play wargames -- just like myself. Besides the necessary mini house rule for determining turn order (see above), [b]1775: Rebellion[/b] is a super solid game. I wish it would have been available back in the days when we were forced to play [b]Risk[/b].

First play: Tons of fun, light war game with great team play (2vs2).  The game is very engaging because you don't know what the turn order will be or how you will do with the dice rolls. Therefore, you need to be extra careful with troop movement.  Everyone had a blast with rolling the dice and having some intense battles.  Had a great time with this game. 8.5

Slightly more complex than 1812.  Love the added colony control aspect of the game.  It allows the Command Decisions to be even more meaningful, as you move into unguarded cities to disrupt the enemies control of a colony.  I also prefer how reinforcements are done in this game - 4 in colonies you control opposed to the static regions in 1812.  Allows for greater flexibility in getting troops where they are needed.

After one play, a 2er, I was really happy with this game and look forward to playing it again as soon as I can.  For me it is a very good, light war game.  It has the strategy of deployment and army creation, with the simplicity of straightforward rules and the dice make the game, both in battles and for turn order.  However, the dice do not rule the game, they remind you that as with any "war" you cannot assume success or failure.  I am really interested in playing this game with 4 people and imposing some sort of communication ban to see how it plays out

Good relatively light wargame, re-enacting the American revolution. Loved the interaction between the factions (you can create armees of two to three factions + native Americans fighting on one side), and the dice mechanism to resolve battles works excellent.

Overall, excellent experience.

RATING: 7
1775: Rebellion is a light war game, and sequel to 1812: The Invasion of Canada.  They have a lot of similarities in play, but there are some important differences between the games.  Though good, this is the weaker of the two.

The game can be played by 2-4 people.  In it players take on the role of one of four factions: the British Regulars, the Loyalists, the traitorous American regulars, or the equally traitorous colonial militia.

Card play determines troop movement, and special actions that can be taken.  Battles are handled through the roll of custom dice.  Each faction has it's own unique dice.  They tell you what happens in combat.  There are no charts to consult!  The game is over at the end of a round that sees one side have all of its special "Treaty of Paris" cards out.  The winner is the side that has the majority of flags on the board.  You put a flag out by completely controlling a colony.

Unlike 1812 where the battle lines were very clear, i.e. the boarder between the Canadas, and the United States, 1775's battle lines are a patchwork of unconsolidated colonies.  I prefer the former, but the latter does provide a unique challenge to contend with.

I guess the thing that bothers me the most about the game is its handling of natives.  Natives in 1775 are neutral, but are easily swayed to the side of whichever army enters their territory.  Those same native units will then change sides if the army they are with is defeated.  So, they become these mindless fair-weather friends.  Various native tribes at this time were allied with either the British, or the rebelling colonists.  Though I'm sure some played both sides against the middle, many were stanch allies of one or the other.  This was largely because an enemy native tribe was allied to other side.  I would have preferred to see two types of native units, one allied to the British, the other to the rebels.

I did like the ability of third parties to enter into the war.  It was realistic and a nice twist to the game.

Overall, I like 1775.   That sentiment pales in comparison to the love I have for its predecessor.

RATING: 8.5
1775 is the lightest of wargames. The best description I can conceive of for it is that it is Risk without all the parts of Risk that I hate. All players are in the game until the very. Due to how reinforcing works, there is less of a slippery slope in losing ground (Your reinforcements will be concentrated allowing you to push back more readily while your opponents will have likely become over extended). The event cards and dice do add a bit of a random element to the game but it can be almost assured that the bad luck will end up relatively evenly distributed by the end of the game.

12/21/13 Played a four-player game in five hours. I look forward to playing it many times in the future. I found the production values very good (except the French purple dice are too dark; the black symbols on them are *very* hard to see). I like that each faction is a little different. Though I was slightly dismayed by the level of collusion that is allowable between allies (showing each other their cards and lots of table talk). My only question now is how does it play with less than a full compliment of four.

One thing perplexed me. Why did it take five hours when its predecessor took a lot less, even though it had one more player to ponder his moves?  My guess is its a lot easier to create a bunch of small battles in 1775 (with *many* ways to move to do so). Where 1812 tended (in my two games) to have only 1-2 each turn. Basically 1812 has a "front line" while 1775 does not; everything is always vulnerable. That makes one ponder a great deal worrying about possible enemy action darn near everywhere. Also, in 1812 water movement was pretty much relegated to the Great Lakes. While in 1775 the whole east coast in always open to invasion. That multitude of options means a player has to do a lot of planning before he decides on exactly what to do on a turn (if he has a boat move - where to invade, if he doesn't - how best to defend against a boat move).

RATING: 7
The inclusion of Native Americans adds a flexible, neutral element that can be scooped up by any side in order to be competed/persuaded to join your army.

One downfall, in my opinion, is the inclusion of the Treaty cards and the rule mechanic that any player can play a Treaty card for a total of two on each side. If the two Treaty cards from one side are played then the came is over because one sided ceded. Granted the Treaty cards don't have to be played, but it does limit your plays when you draw a Treaty card due to the 3-card hand limit.

A coercion mechanism forcing or influencing one army to pose a treaty deal would be better suited instead of the current rule set.

RATING: 8
I have played it with both four players and two players. With two it can be a little difficult to keep track of two hands of cards and two decks, but it isn't bad. I like the game best when it ends early. By the end of 8 rounds, the game feels like it is dragging. 

Overall, I find it to be an enjoyable light wargame, but I use the term wargame loosely. I don't think there is any real simulation value here and it feels more like an area majority game. It gives me a similar feeling that I get when I play El Grande, which isn't a bad thing.

Kickstarter

*Jan 2014* After 3 plays (and about 4 or 5 of 1812), this game sits at a high spot on my chart. First, let me say I absolutely adore this game and its gameplay, at least with 2p (I've only played 1812 once with team play). For gameplay alone, it's rated a 9. I will never turn down an opportunity to play with someone if they suggest it. 

The components are beautiful, ESPECIALLY the map. It's huge! It looks like a real wargaming map! You have to stretch wayyyy across the table to maneuver your troops in the southern US which helps even anti-grognards get immersed in the feel of why wargames can be awesome. 

The rules themselves are filler level. Seriously. The strategy doesn't have a lot of depth but has a lot of breadth (as an area control game), so there's a lot to explore here while the game is still appealing to the casual crowd (especially with team play).

1775 is a light 90-120 minute 2p or team-based dudes-on-a-map wargame. It's also versatile in that it can be played as a serious non-brainburny wargame or for laughs (especially with 4p).

In my 3rd game (first with wife), I kicked her ass the entire game and won in the 7th round 7-6. 

Why my wife liked it: Even though there were times she was down to two colonies to my 7, making her discouraged, she still managed to come out to a close game which made her feel good about herself.

Why I liked it: I knew, based off the position my wife was taking, that she didn't have a hope in hell to win. At no point did she ever have more colonies than me once the game got in gear (after 2nd round). So my superior strategy meant my win was never in danger.

Why I won't get bored of this game: My wife could have easily exploited the weakness I purposely left open (because I knew she wouldn't); that I spread myself thin. My wife kept her colonies to the south and in the middle while I had the north with only a few cubes in there.

As my wife gets more experienced at the game, she will get used to the idea of how area control games work and will be a way more formidable opponent. For a game this simple, it speaks of future clashes that shall be tense and awesome.

Oh, and my wife looked me in the eye after the game ended and said "Rematch"!

I'm still fascinated by 1775. 

I like what low-raters typically dislike:
- the huge swings (fun)
- the 2vs2 teamplay (I would not play this as a 2 player):  this increases the amount of tabletalk, and nothing beats humming a national anthem after just conquering a new territory.
- luck of the draw in player order: this is war! You (also) need luck to win.

This game deserves a longer review, but the short version is this: It's an incredibly swingy area control/majority game with bits of war elements. Between the dice rolling, card draw, and random turn order, the luck component is off the charts. Best at 2p in my opinion. Team play is fun but too slow in my experience. Skill definitely plays a part, but bad luck can significantly stymie players, and there is a large advantage to the player who draws the final turn.

Un jeu très beau et très épuré. Idéal en équipe et accessible aux joueurs occasionnels, 1775 souffre de s'appuyer trop sur le hasard, notamment au moment de l'implacable (et pourtant décisif) tirage de l'ordre de jeu.
Ce qui n'empêche pas les parties d'être agréablement tendues jusqu'au bout.

Interesting game, but some aspects seem a little too gamey or too luck-driven.

The way event cards can be drawn or not, the way you can draw the Truce card in a timely fashion or not, all seems rather too much driven by luck.

The gamey part comes mainly with the troops that have run away and then get to fight in a very different and often distant place all over again, in the same turn!

This fixes a couple of issues I have with 1812 (which I still enjoy). First off, 1775 is 2-on-2 as opposed to 2-on-3. This is huge because, even though the forces were balanced, one team getting more actions than the other threw things out of whack - especially when the turn order is randomized as it is. One team could potentially get 6 turns in a row.

I like the way the defenders always get first attack regardless of whose homeland it is. Makes more sense to me. The way control is based on regions instead of single areas works better and makes the game less swingy (in 1812 taking over 2 areas meant that your opponent lost 2VP and your team gained 2).

All in all, I'm very pleased with 1775 after one play.

Still satisfied 12 plays later.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A phenomenal light war game that gives players plenty of interesting and difficult decisions, but given the element of chance with the dice rolls, still adds significant drama and tension. Our final turn came down to the luck of the turn draw order, and while this may be off-putting for some, the fact that you could mitigate some of the random elements with careful planning and decision making means that it's not just a dice-fest. I really enjoyed my experience and would not hesitate to play this one again.

Great game that combines the fun of rolling dice with a good amount of strategy. It feels like a 50/50 split between luck and tactics and strategy, and I like that. It's also a game that encourages/mandates teammwork without either party feeling subservient. 

This one edges out 1812 a little bit for me because of the fact that the whole  map feels important, and because of the inclusion of Hessian and French factions that can show up at different points. 

Played: 3 times.

RATING: 8.5
What I have said about 1812 I can almost verbatim repeat here. Is it worth owning both? Absolutely! I love being able to alternate between a 4 and 5 player game. 1775, while being almost identical rules-wise, feels quite different in play, which is a major feat. The setup is a lot more confrontational right off the bat, than it is in 1812. That's not to say that 1812 does it worse, but this way you can actually choose the right game to your mood and liking. I also do like the minor changes, in that the defender now always attacks first, which in this particular scenario makes more sense than the system used in 1812 where the initiative goes to the player on whose home state the battle takes place. Also, fighting over whole colonies, which themselves are split into multiple territories and cities, is a thematically sound and overall fun deviation from its predecessor.

RATING: 8
This is a card driven area movement game like 1812: Invasion of Canada which was the first game in the series.  If you have played 1812 you will pick up the play in this game very quickly.  This game is played by a maximum of four players instead of the five for 1812 but both games play well even solo.  With only a dozen cards a side and a limited but variable number of rounds per game this game plays quite quickly.  The Native blocks in this game are not as powerful as in 1812 and they fight for both sides in 1775.  A worthy successor to 1812.  I'm looking forward to getting the next game in the series (1754 French and Indian war) So I can run a 60 year North American campaign!

I had reservations about this game thinking the American War of Independence wouldn't translate as well as 1812. I was wrong. 1775 is a fantastic, light wargame that has good historical flavor.  Well done Academy!

I enjoy this game, even though it's basically just a slight variation on Risk. I have two major problems with it though. The historical flavor is pretty poor, and the endgame turn order draw can heavily favor the fourth turn player that round. That being said, this is a great option for a light war game centered around the American Revolutionary War. I ultimately kept Nexus Ops over this.

Based on the mechanics in 1812, this 4 player game pits the British against the Americans. Like 1812, each player has a unique deck, and dice, while turn order is drawn out of a bag for each round. Whoever controls the most states when a side has played both truce card wins.

It's a fun system, and my rating of this will likely rise after more plays. I like the intricacies of the map, and wide possibilities.

[b]Components: 4/5[/b] They aren't spectacular by any means, but they really get the job done. The simplicity of this game allows the components to only be colored cubes and that's all it takes. They are easy to handle, and it's clear what the power of a player is in a specific colony. The board clearly denotes the colonies, and there is quite a bit of bookkeeping information on the board itself. It's nice. 

[b]Strategy: 3/5[/b] It's mostly making sure that you block off recruit areas that you don't want your enemies to have. That, and finding good times to recruit native americans. This is a dice chucker without a huge potential for luck mitigation short of throwing more units at the problem, but because of how easy it is to recruit units, this isn't always a problem.

[i]For the first time I got to play 1775 three times in the span of a month and my impressions of the game have soured somewhat. While I love the game play and presentation of the game I have a problem with the randomness of the dice. Each of the three games has literally come down to one die roll and that just isn't satisfying after putting in 2+ hours into a game. You can outmaneuver your opponents and still lose because of the dice. It wouldn't be quite as frustrating if the game wasn't so long. I'll still play, but I know enough people who own the game that I no longer feel like I need it in my collection especially since it'll never get played at home.[/i] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]- Great theme, with beautiful production values.
- Simple game play and easy to teach, but man this game has lots of depth.
- The card play for movement/ special actions is great. You can move any armies, but only a limited number and only so many spaces.
- The dice based combat is perfect, units can flee (which you get back later) or you may be able to move an army to an adjacent space. 
- I could write a novel about how amazing this game is, if you are interested at all check out some of the reviews.
- The 4p game has you play in teams: with each side being composed of 2 armies (The British Regulars and British Loyalists on one side and the Continental Army and Colonial Militia being the other). You each control an army and you decide how to move armies that contain at least one of your units making it very important to talk with your ally.

All of my original thoughts still hold true. While this isn't a game that I'm going to get to the table often it is still a staple in my collection. Every time I've gotten to play this has been a memorable experience that I have thoroughly enjoyed. This game shines because of the elegant and simple rule set which allows you to focus on your strategy without having to worry about remembering a complex set of rules.

I've enjoyed it with both 2 and 4 players and I probably prefer it with 4 (as long as you play with the right group). If you want complete control, then I would recommend playing with 2. However; if you are willing to give up some of that control then the 4p game is an amazing experience with a lot of dialogue between teammates and trash talk with your opponents. Every four player game I've played have been raucous affairs.[/i]

[i]Amazing game, I was blown away playing this game. Totally blows Memoir 44 out of the water for me , 1775 will be its replacement. There is such a simple elegance to this game, yet tons of depth. The highlight of the game is how the balance of power keeps shifting, you are never in a dominant position no matter how good your situation appears to be. I can't wait to play this one again.[/i]

Juegazo de estrategia durante la independencia de los Estados Unidos. Facil de aprender pero con su chicha... el combate es  por dados y se usan cartas para los movimientos. Lo mejor es que es multijugador, permitiendo de 2-4 jugadores y por equipos... Muy divertido y partidas no muy largas. Must have.

This is an amazing, light wargame. It is a great combination of strategy, tactics, and randomness. Every play has been very memorable and tense. The back and forth of the combat and the tension of the Truce Cards has produced numerous "stand-up" moments for us.

RATING: 7
This is a great light wargame/area control euro that plays well at both 2 and four player (team play). It can be very swingy with territories changing hands frequently, which is good in some ways because you never feel out of the running if the other side surges ahead. The different dice for each of the factions are brilliant and create different feeling factions without adding extra rules that players would normally have to remember. The simple rule set means that I have played this with seasoned war gamers as well as gamers who prefer lighter games (the team aspect helps this too). Everyone I have played with has enjoyed the game a lot. 

My main issue with the game is that the way truce cards end the game and come with powerful movements on them, this allows a faction to end the game and setup a situation that the other side cannot come back from. I'm not sure I like this as it can make it feel like all the turns before aren't as important as one in which the final truce is played. Still a great game though that I enjoy a lot.

I Played a 4 player game at Board Game League of Canton. Incredibly intense and fun game. You can never do everything you want to. Unfortunately due to some misunderstood rules, my partner and I accidentally lost Georgia about midway through the game and could never regain it. We also neglected Nova Scotia too long and the British built up a large force there and then used their warship card to invade Boston. We eventually beat them back and the last turn we tried to push them out of Portsmouth but failed. The game ended 6 to 4 in favor of the British. If we hadn't lost Georgia and neglected to land forces in Nova Scotia, we might have had a chance! I can't wait to play this again!

I played this one with my 8 yrs old son. The rules are easy to understand and the gameplay was interesting. There's a good mix of decisions and some luck involved with the dice rolling/battles. The games components are very nice, with good addition of solid/laminated control markers (Kickstarter bonus). We had some questions about the number if territories for some states, but we quickly found answers on the 'Geek. I enjoyed the first play and would definitely play again.

Wow! They took basically the same game as 1812, tweaked the rules slightly, changed the map and cards, and it becomes an even better (and almost completely different) game. 

Quick to learn and plays quickly too. The complexity is all in your decisions, not in the game system. Looks really good on the table as well. 

As with 1812, outstanding!

This is a fun, fast, and quite light game about the Revolutionary War. The map is beautiful and the dice combat is very elegant. It doesn't have quite as much historical feel as I was hoping for, likely a trade-off in favor of easy game play. Since the game is relatively short, drawing the right cards at the right time is a major factor in who will win. I prefer it as a two player game, but I like that you can play two-on-two teams for teaching new gamers.

A fantastic light war game for 4 players with a very smooth playing combat mechanic. It plays in under 2 hours and is easy enough to teach to anyone.

Pros:
* A historically based game that is fun to play.
* Great theme.
* A very stream lined dice combat system.
* Beautiful looking game board.

Cons:
* Cubes work but minis would be even better.
* The plastic on the box insert is way too thin.
* Could benefit from larger decks of cards for each faction.

Just way too dependent on luck, between the cards and the dice. Some very odd events - armies moving faster through the Appalachian wilderness than along the developed seacoast is just one example. More examples: "retreating" in good order to join an adjacent battle, "retreating" at the end of a fight to move faster than if there had no battle at all.

RATING: 8
Another great game in the Birth of America series which uses the same innovative gameplay as 1812. This one feels more grand and significant in scope but I'm not sure I like the way reinforcements and scoring work quite as much (you can end up with huge numbers of troops suddenly and rather unrealistically appearing in one place and, because it's much easier to conquer and hold a small state, like Rhode Island or Delaware, than the big ones, like NY or Pennsylvania, you tend to find these areas receive rather more attention than perhaps they should as all states are worth one victory point regardless of size). Still, a really fun experience overall which allows a satisfying game of the American War of Independence to be played in just a couple of hours.

Good game, light and fun wargaming, not so fast in the first game in my group (almost 3 hours including rules explanation). Great deal of interactivity and teamwork, which I like a bit. I was not bored even during my teammate's turns. 
Too much randomness for me, I did not like that turn order was determined by puling the dice out of a bag. I would like to explore the game further to see if this could be midigated somehow by strategic decisions.

Strong 7 for me. I will keep it and would play it again gladly, even suggest to play a game.

A fantastic light wargame. The type of light wargame that you could play with about anybody. Has the potential to be a '9' with more plays. Simple rules and mechanics. Players are constrained by their movement every turn, so tough decisions have to be made. Turn order is randomized, which makes for some interesting challenges. The fact that I can play this with four players (instead of just two) puts it slightly ahead of Sekigahara in my Top 20 list.

It's low because it really IS near the level of Risk, but I really enjoy some of the things it does mechanically.  It would rate higher if it wasn't just a slog of piling on troops ala Risk style.  It seems like I'm bashing it, but I really enjoyed the game.

I like it. It's a very, very simple area control wargame with a coop element and a lot of dice chucking, but it's also tense, full of wild swings and not too long. Great game if you want to introduce your friends to wargaming. It seems a bit unbalanced (going last twice in a round is a HUGE bonus, and round sequence is random), but it never spoiled the fun (at least for me). It also plays very well head to head and is as good with two players as with four or three.

Also, the production quality is just top notch. It's a beautiful and very well made game - a real gem in that aspect - so that's also that if you enjoy your games pretty.

First play was tense and enjoyable. I generally like everything from Academy, the components here are top notch. While I did go last and win, that didn't seem to carry as much weight as going last does in 1812. 

Two plays in, and I'm more impressed. Ebb and flow is really nice--no one is down long. Increasing rating to 9 for now, and this will be my light, four-player wargame of choice (sorry, A Distant Plain gets the overall nod).

What a great game! When I first looked at it, I was extremely skeptical about its quality. The artwork, while detailed looked boring, the dice looked silly and the card amount seemed low. But after 2 games, the gameplay felt fast and strategic. The rules aren't hard at all and while there is things to think about, it never feels too overwhelming. The last game I played, we ended up with a tie and it felt great all around. This is my top pick for area control game because its accessible, doesn't have diplomacy bullshit seen in other games, fits up to 4 and plays relatively quickly.

A beautiful game with a Revolutionary War veneer. The Rules are intuitive and well organized, while  the components are attractive, functional and highly thematic. Overall, the  system is fun and very easy to understand, so 1775 would be a solid entry point for those thinking about a war-themed design, but not ready to dive into a 20 plus page rules set.  Washington's War is in no danger of being dethroned by this gem of a game, but I can see it as a fun,   less complicated,    immersive alternative.

Really like the dice mechanic where different units use different colored dice.  The way retreat results are implemented is very interesting.  Personally I love using cubes to represent units, but it makes me want the game to be an area majority game where enemy units can occupy the same space without combat, rather than area control where only one side can occupy a space.  I found the card-driven part of the system not as interesting and wish the great dice combat had been activated in a different way.

This is an absolutely fantastic strategic game. The way battles are resolved is really smooth and streamlined.

It would get a 10 if it weren't for the fact that it is theoretically possible for one side to have four turns in a row before the other side gets a turn.

In a game where it is possible to severely deplete the other side's armies in two consecutive turns to a point of almost not being able to recover (I've done this), the possibility of FOUR turns in a row turns an otherwise strategic game into one with too much dependence on luck.  

I think I'll be house ruling this so that if a player gets the last two turns in a round, at the beginning of the following round the first turn will only be drawn from the other players' dice. The second turn would return to normal with all three remaining dice.

Kudos for a job very well done, not withstanding the single potential flaw.

I like the simple game system.  I've only played this 2 player but it is played often.  Large momentum swings are likely which keeps all players interested as they are never out of the game.  However, the massive swings also tend to undermine long term strategic planning. 

Good game.

Had this one in the wagame category originally, but somehow whenever I play it it doesn't feel like a wargame. It's a great game, fantastically fun area control and dice rolling fighting. the strategic deployment in battle adds so much interest to the game, but I'm feeling more of a Wallenstein type lineage than a Washington's War. COuld be just me, but there you go. I guess I'm calling it ameritrash.

Takes a while to realize just how much of the game is about controlling recruitment spots, but when you do the game goes up a level. Still heavily mitigated by luck, but a better player will generally win. My last game was a blowout 8-2 victory against a similarly experienced player, but one who hadn't made the recruitment leap yet.

RATING: 8
The charm lies in the simplicity and elegance of the system allowing the players to be immersed in the success and failures of the respective outcomes of the battles. A static setup immediately takes on a life of its own as card draw, decisions and die rolls develop into a tug of war with surprise moves and outcomes. Players can just enjoy the to and fro of the sides and lose themselves in the game rather than bury their noses in the rulebook.

Each side plays differently and has their strengths and weaknesses to exploit. Sometimes needs override the desire for smart play and bold undertakings are attempted. Securing your reinforcement cities is essential. Blocking quick passage through your lines by leaving the odd friendly cube around is a very good idea.

How much replay value the game has remains to be seen, but it's looking like a fun ride and the beauty is that the rules are so easy that the game can be forgotten for a long time and picked up easily enough without sweating a rules refresh.

Fun, quick and satisfying. Plenty of groans and regrets, but also decisions, risks, smart play and laughs. Good fun.

-------------

One small note: Although I don't think the game should be taken too seriously, I would like to try a small modification to the rules with regard to the turn order activation cubes. Just to prevent four activations in a row by one side - the final two of a turn and the first two of the next turn. Maybe something along the lines of: If a side draws the last two activation cubes in a turn, that side may not draw the first activation cube of the following turn.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a light Risk-derivative game that uses card-driven movement/events and area control to simulate the Revolutionary War. 

Battles are resolved via dice rolls, which can feel swingy, but there are enough rolls over the course of the game to mitigate any perceived unfairness. Card play can feel a bit swingy too since it is possible to end up with unusable or useless cards in hand for several turns in a row and the game does not last that many turns (on the other hand, without the cards the game will have almost no connection to its theme). Player order for a turn can be quite critical, but is a totally random affair too. 

If one can look past the many random elements in the game, it should make for an entertaining gateway game into the genre. My rating is based on one play only, so take my comments for what it is worth.

Mini-wargame. Con un tablero precioso y componentes notables, 1775 se presenta como un juego perfecto para iniciarse en los wargames. Reglas sencillas, turnos rápidos, posibilidad de jugar a 2 o 4 jugadores y partidas de duración comedida. 
El turno consta de una fase de refuerzos, movimiento y batalla, además de reponer cartas. Hay dos tipos de ellas, movimiento y eventos.
Los combates se deciden con unos dados personalizados, y que son diferentes para cada una de las facciones del juego, dando como resultado combates a veces impredecibles aunque muy divertidos.

FUN ★★★★✰
Moving cubes around is not really my cup of tea (party), but in this case I enjoy it a lot. The game is tense, the victory unsure until the end. How the combats are resolved is really simple and fun. I'm a bit concerned about the replayability though. This game motivates me to find another game on the same topic that would be more historical and render better the true story. A good point here is that it's very simple to setup and can be played with anybody for around 2 hours. Perfect for a rainy sunday with girlfriend or friends.

RULES ★★★★★
5 pages of rules and you are done. This game can be explained in 15 minutes to a non-wargamer. Simple and effective, really well done.

IMMERSION ★★★✰✰
Even though the game is fun and simple, I lack of impression that I'm replaying a war. The game is quite abstact and I'm not sure I've learned a lot on this conflict. Some cards explain the context but it's quite weak in this area. Maybe I'll look for another game to better understand what this war consisted of.

DEPTH ★★★✰✰
I've played it only once, but I alread feel that the games could be repetitive and look too much the same. I'm not sure that there are many different strategies to win.  We'll see. For now, I rate it at 3/5.

An excellent, fast-playing beginner's wargame, this bridges the gap between simple euros and basic wargames. Limitations on the number of dice and values on each of side for different types of units is an incredibly elegant way of 'baking in' the game mechanics and nuance. Naval movement is incredibly powerful, but randomly drawn. Unlike [b]1812: The Invasion of Canada[/b], it's possible to make grand manoeuvres, but this involves a significant amount of gambling.

The shortcut one army=one cube settled by dice is not my thing I think. Really much prefer A few Acres of Snow oin the Board/Wargame family with the same Atmosphere/Time period play. Sold

A simple area control game with lots of dice rolling and somewhat interesting card play. After playing Washington's War and then getting on the table again, I lowered my rating a bit. It's great to play with newcomers and younger gamers, but for my Grognard buddies, I would rather play WW.

Far better than 1812, as this one seemed to offer a much more tense and even battle, as both sides get two turns per round. I love the goals of colony control and how the control of colonies is what's necessary for reinforcements. It manages to reproduce the very wild and open multiple fronts of the war and do it such that the game creates it organically, which is quite impressive.

1 play, 2er

A fun, very light, card-driven area control game. 

It's the British + Loyalists against the Continental Army + Patriots. Each (of max 8) turns, the 4 groups take turns in random order. There is always a steady flow of fresh recruits since you always add at least 4 armies to the board on your turn. You use your cards to move 1-4 armies 1-3 spaces each; but if you have cubes of your teammate in the army, they come along as well! Combat is also quite simple: just roll a die per cube in your army, of the matching color (max 2 or 3 dice per color). You'll roll either hits, flees (your piece runs away, to be recruited again next turn!), or "command decisions" (you may make a strategic withdrawl). All of these -- muster, movement, combat, events -- are very simple. 

The game moves along at a nice pace and is quite fun. Need to try the 4er version!

Like 1812: Invasion of Canada, this is a heavily abstracted war game and a fun one.

This is a simple game.  As a fan of Washington's War and other complex wargames, this is certainly too easy.  However, and what makes this game utterly awesome for me, is that I can get my wife to play it.  Heck, you can get most people to play it!  The rules are so intuitive and simple that picking it up never takes more than 10 minutes.  I would never recommend this on game night when my other gamer friends are over, but on a night where my wife and I are both available, it can easily get to the table and be played in roughly an hour.

Great game for what it is.  If your expectations are for a simple but fun and quick historic game going in, you'll quickly fall for it!

I like the theme and the history lesson at the end of the rules.  Production quality is top notch.  Of all of the games I have this might have one of the best ratio's when I look at rules complexity (pretty easy to grasp) and decision making (so many possibilities!).  

The only negative is the random turn order being determined by pulling a die.  We have had games where the same player goes 3 times in a row and just makes it very difficult for the other player to catch up.

One more negative...I don't get to play it as much as I would like to!  I picked it up because I hoped my family would like playing 2x2.  I was wrong.  My wife doesn't like cooperative games and my son's interest in playing board games has steadily decreased as he has become a teenager.  So...my daughter (7 years old) will play with me.  We don't use the truce cards and she really enjoys the game.

RATING: 8
Well executed American War of Independence game. It takes it's cue from the previous game in the 'Birth of America' series, '1812: The Invasion of Canada', where gameplay is card driven allowing for certain numbers of troops to be moved each turn and combat is resolved using dice depicting hits, redeployments and troops fleeing. Whilst this aspect of the game is almost identical to '1812' the way the game plays is quite different, where the vast area and low troop density of the former is replaced by greater troop numbers in more static fronts. The victor is the side who controls the most states once a side has played two truce cards. Overall '1775' feels more like an area control/majority game than a wargame but the system employed works once again and leads to a tight and tense gaming experience.

Based on a read of the rules, I described it while first teaching it as "team-based El Grande with dice combat and set in the American Revolution."  Playing it cemented that description in my mind.  This really is a Euro game with an entrenched historical context rather than a war game.  But that's fine with me, because that means it's easy to teach, easy to set up and take down, and you could easily punch through a session in an evening after work.

There are a few elements to this design that I appreciate.  One is the team-based play.  Another is the random/unknown turn order each round.  Another is the ease of movement and resulting frequency of combat.  Another is the players' control of when the game will end.  Together, these elements make for a fast, frantic, and furious fight for colonies.

After a 4-player game, I'm happy with the outcome. It's a pretty basic game in terms of rules, but the game play seems to offer a lot more depth than found in the rule set. There's good tension too. I look forward to more plays, and plan to report back more when I do. My initial rating is a 7.5. I could go up or down depending on all the regular stuff.

::UPDATE:: 06/01/2014
I've been looking for a solid game to replace Twilight Struggle for a long time. I found TS to be too long, and too tedious for my 2-player needs as my wife is not into learning the whole deck, nor playing a long game often even enough to do so. This game has finally achieved that goal. It's just so much more...fun! than any other two-player, war-driven game. The dice rolls are exciting and deliver interesting results. The end-game has been close in my two plays, even though so much of the game is decided by dice. They managed to pull off a great system here, which blends the excitement of the unknown and the interest of strategic thinking and planning. And they somehow did it with balance.

Bravo, Academy Games. This is a great little game.

Ordered it as another one for my favorite category of wuro-games, especially since it plays up to 4 but still is good at two. The fact that it is a LIGHT war game is a benefit, too, as that allows me to bring it to the table with my regular groups without scaring anyone away. My wife enjoyed her first two plays, so this will see table time. And our first 4 player game was a hoot, will definitely see more table time with that group, too.

RATING: 8
[thing=128996][/thing] is a very light on rules wargame - easier to learn and play then most middle-weight euros, and certainly less complex than most proper ameritrash. On it, four main factions -  the American Continental Army and Patriots against the British Army and the Loyalists - battle for the control of colonies, provinces and territories. A turn is simple: reinforcements are put on cities; movement of armies (by land or, less often, water); battle resolution; card draw. That is it. There is no concerns about cover, flanking, surprise, terrain, constructions, roads, supply, and so much more that features in many wargames. Though this might worry someone, [thing=128996][/thing] is closer to [thing=181][/thing] than [thing=24800]Conflict of Heroes[/thing] or [thing=21050]Combat Commander[/thing].

But wait: [thing=128996][/thing] is one of those rare that are getting harder to find: the light on rules but deep on options and decisions. The actions, by themselves, are pretty easy - add troops, use cards to move armies and/or to trigger events, battle -; and even the fight resolution is quite direct, just rolling special dice and using them to kill, flee or retreat. However, the implications of each choice, as well as the timming involved, make them more colorful and complicated - how many troops to move, were to pressure, which card to hold, what is the board situation, etc.

The board state, by the way, is critical, as in [thing=128996][/thing] the end game is determined by the players - each faction has an unique deck, and each has a Truce card. If one side plays both of its Truce cards, this will mark the last round of the game (from the third round forward). This puts the game in a constant tug of war, as no side can have the luxury of being behind and not worry about it. This send sides to conflict, be to take control, to recover territory or simply to put a foothold and not give control of a region to the other side. A key design decision, since another design decision - give the advantage to the defense - can, and in several games, do, lead to a sort of anti-game, with sides just turtling and waiting, in a total bore of a game. [thing=128996][/thing] dodges this by pushing toward battles, for will or for need, as well as due to the constant reinforcements given.

Therefore, [thing=128996][/thing] is a game filled with tension, from the random order of the turns to the relentless fight for territory. It keeps itself fast-paced, with quick resolution for each of its phases, allowing games the end around 1 hour (though, it can take more). It has an amount of luck built in - the order of the round, the draw of cards and the rolls of the dice -, yet the strategy, mixed with tatical decisions, is what will win the day. Overall, [thing=128996][/thing] leaves a strong positive impression, both due to the quality of the components and, specially, for the smooth gameplay and replay value. Recommended.

In this game two sides square off for control of early America: the British v. the Patriots. Every turn brings a skirmish with suspenseful dice battles. The Hessians and Native Americans join the sides to further make things interesting. The game is nicely balanced for 2 players with both sides playing two armies each. Four players gives each player one army.

Rating after one play with two players. I can surely see this rating rise after more plays and more familiarity with the event cards. 1775 plays fast, is easy to explain and each turn feels exciting. The Truce cards really give something to think about, and the sequence in which factions come out of the cloth bag really needs to be taken into consideration if you want to make the most of your turn. The movement and reinforcement rules make the game really tactical, and the dice add excitement. Components and artwork are great, even though I do not care for the box art (for me it implies that the game is more heavy and dry than it really is). Cannot wait to play again!
UPDATE: After three plays, the luck of the dice is starting to bug me a little bit. Still a fun game though.

This was kind of a big dissapointment for me because I was excited about this game, it had so many elements of fast paced tactical movement and area control that I enjoy... but a few of it's central mechanisms kill it for me.  

The biggest issue being the random turn order draw.  This makes it so it's almost impossible to have longterm plans, or plan when it's not your turn, but worst of all someone can get 4 turns back to back to back to back.  That's crazy.  Such a huge uncontrollable change in momentum when your opponent can just continually string turns like that, take locations and fortify them before you have a chance to respond.  Not only that but you pretty much need the final turn to seal a win, but if you don't pull it off in the final rounds you're out of luck.  Luck luck luck.

Dice combat is swingy but that almost never bothers me, what did bother me was the blanks that let you retreat anywhere you want.  It's really frustrating when you are trying to make a winning move and send 5 guys to kill 1, and that one guy rolls a blank and just moves to an adjacent territory denying your control of the province.

Boat cards are something I was not too fond of either because it's such HUGE reach and it means you're never protected.

Finally one of my biggest pet peeves is when the win condition is reliant on a card draw.  I could have won on round 4 if I had just drawn the other ally card.  Instead it was the last card that I drew so by the time I could end the game the turn order wasn't coming out in my favor.

Lot of great design... but man some of these luck elements could have been cut out.

Usually dice-chucking dudes-on-a-map games aren't my cup of tea, but 1775 is streamlined, exciting, and doesn't overstay its welcome as a 2p game. With 4 players there's just too much downtime for what it is and I rapidly start to feel disengaged. As a 2p though it's a solid light war game. The problem is that 2p games are such a crowded space, so I just don't see the need to own this.

There is a whole lot of depth cleverly concealed in this extremely simple wargame system. Each nation only has 12-15 cards in their order deck and they will play 1-3 of them per turn at which point they are removed from the game. On the surface that seems like the game would be over ridiculously quickly with little if any strategic maneuvering.

The reason it doesn't play out that way is the combat system. It's dice based, but in an interesting twist, there are no results that produce a simple miss. Units either hit, flee or trigger a command decision. A command decision lets you move into another adjacent army or territory to reposition for a counter attack. Fled units leave the immediate battlefield completely...but in its own way even that result is a command decision because they redeploy for free at a controlled colony (even one on the other side of the map) the following turn.

It gives you a tremendous amount of things to think about when deploying and making your very limited moves, yet it really is only a five minute rules set. Outstanding.

A quick to learn and quick to play American Revolution wargame.  Card play, die rolls, and random turn order make for a big dose of chaos resulting in more tactical than strategic decisions.  With all that chaos, never give up.  Players are able to end the game as a team which adds to the tension and urgency.  Playing as a team also adds camaraderie and eliminates the ability to target a single player.  Gorgeous presentation of wooden cubes on a lovely over-sized map.  Nice hefty dice, too.  Great quick-n-dirty wargame fun.

Great system, and a nice "reskin" of 1812. I'm happy to own both games, as they feel sufficiently different from one another.
(I just got trounced by the dice -- my loyalists wouldn't stop fleeing! -- but that's another story...)

Fantastic experience! I love team games and this one didn't disappoint, I love how the dice work and the decisions you make about taking this colony or that one and the reinforcement rules keep the game going fast.

Two player or team vs team gateway war game reenacting the conflict leading to the United States Independence. Brits with the support of the Loyalists attempt to quell the rebellion led by the Continental Army and the Patriots. Allying with the Native Americans, The Hessians and the French is important to both sides. Expansive game board lends to many battle fronts. Each faction has unique decks and special combat dice. Play phases are intuitive and game play goes fast. Reinforcements, move cube units, battle, draw cards. Area control of colonies to win. I like the mechanic where either team member can move a force of combined units. Greatly helps tempo. Also like the encouraged teamwork between teams on coordinating their move and event cards.

Played twice: 2016 Niepołomice Con in four, and once only with my gf. I think it's probably even better than 1812.

So easy to understand, such a balanced gameplay. The rules look much more complex then they are! Wonderful war area control game

Apr 2014. After 3 plays (2 2 player and 1 4 player). My feeling so far is it's a better 2 player. Next time if not playing with newbies in a 4 player I'd make a rule that there is no further discussion when it is the players turn. When there opponents are having there turn you can discuss options. Hopefully this would stop the game bogging down somewhat in a multi player game.

UPDATE: (Aug 2014). on to my 5th game. I'm starting to feel it's starting to get a little repetitive by the nature of the gameplay. i.e. I'm up 1 region. My opponent plays, he takes a region off me and gains a region and so on and so on. Also it is also starting to feel the real hotspots are the regions that are generally no bigger than 3 provinces. The other larger regions are often just too hard to maintain control and defend. It's still a good game. I'm starting to feel that an 8 is max for it's rating. It's certainly better than most 7s I've rated. But only by a little bit.

A good addition to the series.  I wasn't originally going to buy this one, but now I'm seriously considering it.

The need to control all areas within a colony for VP and reinforcement purposes really changes things up from [i]1812[/i].

[i]Update:[/i]

My jets have cooled. Still fun, but the game can grow tiresome once players latch onto the strategy of retreating units into vacant spaces to deny state control.

For precisely this reason, there seems to be a problem with defenders always firing first.  A game should never be structured so that players pray for blank die rolls (aka command decisions).

Definitely not a purchase.

Easy to pick up without being simplistic in execution. Finally there is a  area control strategy game in my collection which won't take 4 hours to play or 3+ people.

Se parece al Risk (que fue un gran juego, pero ya está viejito el pobre) pero con algunos cambios (algunos para mejor y otros para peor).

En mi opinión, para peor...

Like this slightly better than 1812, but only slightly... reasons: map layout, faction decks and 4 instead of 5 player...

The system is so nice and simple, yet deep and full of both strategy and tough tactics. It can be hard to stave off defeat if your side's both factions go first and second in a turn, but it can be done with some clever maneuvering.

Partnership play is just so refreshing and interesting. I find myself constantly engaged as I can talk to my partner about both our strategy and tactics, as well as guessing what our opponents are up to. The game is simply a thrilling ride.

I have rarely seen my friends be so pumped up for any game after the first play. One exclaimed that it was the best game he's ever played, another said it was his first ever wargame and he wants more, and the third made clear that we're playing it again! Awesome.

1775 is a card driven area control game that has a nice wargame feel thanks to the excellently presented theme and fighty dice.  The way reinforcements enter the board only in areas you control makes battle lines form in interesting ways and the random turn order mechanic makes for some great swings of fortune from one side to the other.

While I understand the sentiment many people have that this is really a two player game I know I would miss having another player to work with when planning my moves and cheering the dice on.  Its a really great team experience and I'm looking forward to many enjoyable plays in the future.

Man, what an elegant game. The team aspect is what takes the game from 'very good' to 'fantastic'. It is so tight. One round you're behind, the next lead. Great game

While this is not the most historically accurate or the greatest simulation, it is fun to play and moves along fairly briskly.

I'm not a big fan of dice pools, but at least they work better here than in games like Eclipse or C&C. The card driven system is much improved over games like C&C or Combat Commander. Randomness factor is high, but is compensated by a shorter play time. Recommended for four players. Some players will feel that the splitting of a two sided conflict for multiple players is pointless, but at least it introduces player interaction and a social aspect to the somewhat dry rollfest.

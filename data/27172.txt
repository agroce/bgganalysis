Pretty good two-player strategy game. There are certain game issues not discussed in the rules, but these things can be negotiated easily during game-play. The game pieces and/or board could have been designed a bit better.

A very simple, 2-player, strategic, abstract game with plenty of tactical decisions to make, a short playing time and tactile wooden components. This is a nice little game.

Traded for Last Train to Nuremburg.

An abstract in which you are trying to create certain shapes and connect them. Rules are very simple but it is easy to play wrong because after a while the board becomes such a mess that illegal plays easily escape your eye. Not very inspiring nor original design.

A neat little abstract in which the rules cleverly restrict tile placement possibilities.  This makes you think carefully about the relationship of that tile you're placing to others around it and creates safe spaces, where you can place but your opponent can't.

As others have commented, there's something of a feel of Go about this game; its spatial elements, the fine judgments of what most needs to be done next, and the shifting tempo. All in a game that takes just 15-20 minutes.   

The colour choices in Ponte del Diavolo are pleasing to this eye.  Production quality is as you would expect from Hans im Gluck.

Super tough game to eval after a single play because it's over by the time that the placement rules and general concepts are cemented.  Would like to try it again.  Seems like a great game project for a computer science class with its visual and rule simplicity.  Even a random-playing opponent would work as a teaching instrument.

RATING: 7.5
This is an area control game that is quite nice and looks very nice when finished.  Certain moves are obvious precursors to bridge locations, so it is easy to block your opponent in some situations, but the key lies in positioning several connections for a given turn.  You'll get one island formed, but not both.  I can image that as players improve, the number of connected islands will decrease and since the scoring is tighter with fewer islands, the games will get remarkably tight.  A very good abstract game that I should have played sooner.

Prufffff... No deja de ser un jueguito malo de movil. Es que funcionar funciona, pero para qué?. no transmite nada. Pones losetas y aprovechas al otro para fastidiarle y rentar de sus malos movimientos procurando zafarte de las trabas que él te pone a tí... todo esto pero en malo. Componentes muy austeros. Tablero pequeño y ocupa una caja gigante. La versión de movil no se comerá gran cosa pero la de tablero ya te digo que bastante menos. A favor, partidas cortas (aunque se presta al A/P) y reglas fáciles.

I'm not too keen on abstracts and all, but this one felt even more boring than usual. The bits are nice, though, and it can make a beautiful coffee table game...

UPDATE: I stand corrected. This might not be the best game ever or anything, but it's a pretty cool abstract. A bit too much on the "nasty" side of the spectrum for my wife to enjoy, but I do enjoy being defeated again and again. Up to a 7.

Not my kind of game. I played online against the designer. I'd forgotten a few of the rules by the time they came into play, like that islands can't be even diagonally adjacent to each other, so I'd had stuff set up to do something that I ended up not being able to do. I ended up conceding the game early, because there were no other useful moves I could make. I found the whole thing very annoying. This is exactly the kind of abstract that I hate. My brain just doesn't work this way to be able to see ahead enough turns to make some choices seem better than others and see what my opponent's choices are. Blech.

Bought it after playing it several times on Yucata.de. I don't usually like 2-player abstracts, at least the overly thoughtful ones. But this game is short and fast, and though it gives you plenty of options, the breadth of choices is not such that it causes excessive analysis. 

The game comes in a Carcassonne-size box which is much larger than necessary. I would have liked a smaller, more portable package, though I understand that's a standard size for HiG. That's probably my only real complaint about the game.

IMO this is an instant classic abstract game, even better than Chess. This is an amazing clever game. You have two choices in every turn: put two land tiles or a bridge on a 8x8 board. It's a very agressive game from the first to the last turn. There are defending or attacking movements.

Mostly played in Yucata. After +100 games I have to admit "Ponte del Diavolo" deserves a 10. I'm starting to play really well.

By far, the best abstract strategy game from the last decade.

Played my first game at a tournament in 2016, and lost via the second tie breaker. I generally like the game, but I might suggest the first player place two squares of each color before the second player chooses which color to play. Otherwise, as a pure placement game, a mirroring strategy may reduce the game to whoever has tempo when bridging the center.

This is a very dry abstract but the gameplay works well and games can be tight when playing with a player of equal skill level. A wrong move in this will most likely cost you the game. I would say the game is on par with other abstracts and doesn't have anything that offers something special. It's a good game of skill and great to play. I kind of want to make my own board.

Interesting 2-player abstract brain burner. Once the pieces are placed, they stay where they are for the rest of the game. This rule makes it feel very static, and is probably the reason why I don't like Ponte as much as, say, Yinsh, Dvonn, or Hive, where pieces are moved after being placed,  making those games more dynamic and compelling, in my opinion. 

The tiles are nicely coloured and made of wood. I would have preferred bridges in the 2 player-colours rather than that drab grey finish. Oh, and a board made of wood, wouldn't that be nice?

A bargain from the works bookshop in the UK. Really like it and my eldest likes it too. Great idea I can see the strategy building as we play more. Need to be quick with the bridge building. One problem, the game board is too small and with no way to hold the pieces they fly around in the hands of less dexterous. 
 Would have been much betted with a folding backgammon type board that heald the pieces, would have made it portable also.

There is a lot more to this game than most will notice on the first play.  I've played it scores of times and still enjoy it.  It can be quite brutal, and vary greatly depending on the play style of your opponent.  People who think it doesn't require much thought probably don't play it very well though.  I think it probably plays better at Yucata than in person however because of the analysis paralysis potential.  Better to have unlimited time to take your turn than to do it face to face.

I spend more time in this game making sure the moves are legal than I would like to. Better, when playing an abstract, to burn your brain analyzing a postition than to burn it making sure you're playing within the rules. Let's hope more play will eliminate this problem. The game seems to overflow with tactical possibilities and should be replayable forever.

Good connection game.  Remain to be convinced that there's a first-player disadvantage.  Similar to Taiji in some ways.  And like Othello/Reversi: avoid placing an island with a part on the row next to an edge (allows opponent free-play along the edge).

I mark this down slightly because it is an abstract, and I'm a bit adverse to abstracts, but if you like them, then you will enjoy Ponte. It does have similarities to Twixt, but it's its own game. The simple choice came down to deciding whether you needed to block, or to lay a bridge. If neither, you could try expanding your empire. A well balanced game. Nice components, I would not discourage abstract gamers from buying it, but not my cup of tea.

I like tile games and this is a good, short (15 min), strategic, 2-player game.

The board is flimsy and I would have liked to see the tiles more securely held in place on the board--the slightest bump and they need to be straightened.  Because of the poor board, I lowered my rating by .5--several people I know like the game but after bumping the board and having to start over a few times, won't play it again.

The wood tiles and bridges have a nice look and feel.  Cheap board,quality wood pieces--doesn't make sense.

A good two player connection game that will not be outrageously dominated by connection game enthusiasts.

Downgrade it from 10 to 1. 

I agree with the following statement:

"I'm not crazy about the rule that determines when the game ends. If there are moves that I can still make and my opponent can't, it seems like that's his problem, and I ought to be able to continue [as in Go]." This is just more logical and more beautiful and the end feels less artificial. 

You could call the actual ruleset "German endgame", the proposed rule "Japanese endgame".

Another negative aspect are the artificial tie-breakers which are against the very spirit of the game. 

For instance, if each player has got the same number of points, the player who made more islands wins ("tie breaker 1"). This goes against the essential strategy of the game. Of course players try to win by doing the most effective moves, that is they want to achieve the best outcome by the fewest moves. That is in PdD, they try to connect as many islands as possible by bridges, not to make a large number of islands most of them unconnected. The player who has played in the most effective manner, is punished by tie-breaker 1 and loses. Tie-breakers are actually superfluous since there are not many draws in PdD even among expert players. 

BTW I am the strongest PdD player on Brettspielnetz for years.

Sure! This is a neat abstract. A nice back and forth of building islands and connecting those islands with bridges for larger points. A nice 2-player game. If there is any mark against it, it is the production quality. The lines in the board do nothing to keep the tiles from slipping (and the tiles have no grip). It's not always easy to see if there is a corner of a tile under a bridge or not.  As well, on such a small board the game gets to a point at the end where moves are completely deterministic.  With a slightly larger grid and a board that keeps the tiles from shifting this could be a highly rated abstract. I hope one day a new, larger version will come out!

Played a couple games of this at GenCon.  This is a brilliant connection abstract.  The author admits his inspiration from Randolph's [i]Twixt[/i] and it shows.  There are similarities, especially in the need to foresee your opponent's next moves.  This was my favorite new game of the show.  (Starcraft comes a close second, but I had already playtested that.)

UPDATE: Having played a few more games on Yucata.de, I still like it, but it can be harsh with unmatched opponents.  The end conditions are important to keep in mind.  I still don't grok it, but I enjoy it.

Rating based on online plays at yucata: Great little connection game that makes the alternate win condition in most games the primary win condition. In other words, it is a connection game in which you do not need to worry so much about reaching the "other side" but rather increase your own personal web of connection (and cut your opponent's off). A few simple but effective rules create a few interesting and elegant ripple effects in terms of spatial placements. Overall, a solid game (with an unfortunately poor production value for its physical copy).

A satisfyingly strategic connection abstract without predefined endpoints. The relation to Twixt seems overstated. I did notice it often feels like moves have a symmetric effect: when you mess with your opponent's ability to make groups, you give up your own to a similar extent.

Wow, these are the worst components I've ever seen in a game.

If you were creating a game with wooden tiles that had to be placed on a board and stay there for the rest of the game, would you:

(a) weight the tiles appropriately so they would stay in place (Scrabble, etc.)
(b) create a riveted board so the tiles "lock" in place (Blokus, etc.)
(c) magnetize the back of the tiles and the board so they would be magnetically joined (Cathedral travel edition, etc.)

or....

(d) none of the above.  Let the tiles slide around all over the fucking board.

The manufacturers of Ponte del Diavolo chose (d).

Normally I really try and look past all components issues at the game itself.  In this case, I saw a dry abstract, a pale shadow of the game it attempts to pay homage to, Twixt.  There may well be something more to this game than I suspect, but if its creators didn't care enough to produce it in a useable form, then I don't care to play it.

Nice. Refreshing little abstract.  Plays very fast, and feels tight and focused on small board.  Like it a lot.  Very slightly let own by dreadful board - why the shiny embossed effect, when plain marked squares would have done the job?  Bridges rather poorly finished wood - could have been smoother, classier.  Wood "island squares" nicely finished though.  But nevertheless definitely one for the abstract collection.

RATING: 10
yeah, this is pretty good. I feel like I should be borrowing some Go terminology to describe it, like "tempo". Placing two tiles per turn makes it funky, and there's some nice whiplashing going on between offense and defense. 

Really great variety of tactics - forks, bridge threats vs. tile threats - and at the same time, a dose of larger-scale strategy in trying to cut off your opponent. It's not strictly speaking a connection game, but you do seek to make connections as you go along, with flexible goals.

I'm not crazy about the rule that determines when the game ends. If there are moves that I can still make and my opponent can't, it seems like that's his problem, and I ought to be able to continue, [gameid=8203]-style. Maybe that's just because I've lost that way a few times. But it also seems that that rule flummoxes the Pie Rule, in that it rarely seems advantageous to swap - can be frustrating for player 1.

I'm curious what effect a larger board would have on the balance. And it's not completely obvious to me that the way the scoring system grows would scale properly - the 28 is already a little ridiculous. Frankly, I've had a few very entertaining lower-scoring games with lots of blocking that suggest the board could even be smaller. The game is at its best when it is most vicious.

[update 11/09] Finally raising this to 10. I had held off a long time in deference to [gameid=949]; didn't want to claim Ponte was a better game. But I realized I'm not claiming that; ratings are a measurement of my [i]confidence[/i] in a game's awesomeness. Having played Ponte ~300 times more than Twixt, I can safely say I am quite confident it's awesome.

Also finally playing some Ponte on a larger board, testing out the conjectures made above. No conclusions yet, except to say that it is still far from obvious that a larger board is an improvement.

I don't know if it was the my Italian heritage that drew me to this game, because I'm not a big fan or collector of abstracts.  The gameplay was simple enough, but as with other titles from Italian publishers, the gameplay was just so-so, and the color scheme was muted and uninspiring (I'm looking at you, [b][GameID=35801][/b] and [b][GameID=18932][/b]).

Fantastic abstract.  Easily my favorite.  I like the 10 by 10 grid, which is the same as the produced version, but there is a larger 12 by 12 grid online somewhere.  I play on Yucata and occasionally face to face with my Rio Grande/Hans Im Gluck version.  Unfortunately, it is fairly under-produced.  At least it's inexpensive, which means everyone should have a copy.  It has wooden pieces but they are light and easily shift.  It needs a board like the old Acquire boards where the pieces sit in place.  It truly deserves an elegant presentation, with a heft which represents its strategy.  One of these days, I swear, I'm going to have one made (I probably couldn't do it myself, but I've thought about learning some wood working skills just so I could make some boards to give to family and friends).  

As for the game itself, it has such a fluid feel to it.  Yes, it's Go-like as others have said, or similar to Twixt which the designer credits as an influence (actually Alex Randolph, Twixt's designer).  I played the designer, Martin Ebel, online once and had a nice chat with him about his game.  I only barely lost.  Well done, Martin.  A lovely, elegant game.  Truly perfect.

I had the benefit of being introduced to this game by the designer himself, Martin Ebel, at Spiel 2014 in Essen.

I really love the simple elegance of Ponte del Diavolo where you carefully lay out islands and bridges to maximize your score while at the same time minimizing that of your opponent. Nothing redundant clutters the game experience, only a pure tactical game remains.

The only thing I miss is an expansion for more players than two.

RATING: 9
I just discovered this great abstract, and am amazed at how simple and fun it is to play, yet how deep it is. Here are some of the elements that make for great strategic and tactical decisions: 

•	The rule that an island must have a space all around it requires great care when building sandbars, and gives you some neat choices for blocking your opponent’s island dreams. 

•	The rule that each square can only host one bridge span increases the decision-making. Again, something you have to watch out for, but also something you can use against your opponent.

•	The rule that you can only do one of two things (place two stones or place one bridge) each turn gives you options to really pinch your opponent (and yes, once again, vice versa). 

•	And despite the objections of some, I like the end-game condition. It really ups the skill level required to be good at this game. I don’t find it inelegant, artificial, or arbitrary at all.

I suppose hundreds of plays could reveal some shallowness and change my mind, but through my first few games this one seems like a classic.

A quick two-player abstract from Hans im Gl&uuml;ck, with nice bits. With all the territory gaining and blocking, gives me a bit of a go-like feeling. Not too brainburning anyway.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Players must connect groups of up to four orthogonally connected pieces of theirs on the board using bridges, scoring more or less at the end of the game depending on the amount of groups that have exactly four pieces and how many of these are connected. Groups that score can't touch other friendly groups, not even diagonally. Once a stone or bridge is placed on the board, it can't be altered (i.e. the game is actually playable with pencil and paper).

The biggest source of tension in the game is how players can use a turn either to fill the board (two pieces on the board per turn, giving more options than just one, as is frequently done in connection games) or to place a bridge. Since valuable groups of the same colour can't touch there is a certain urgency in securing the right areas of the board, but without bridges there are no big scores.

With Ponte del Diavolo Martin Ebel has paid a terrific tribute to Alex Randolph: the way the board must be occupied (by stones or by blocking spaces) reminds of the old master's Hepta; the bridges obviously bring Twixt to mind and the pasted-on topic is an obvious nod to Randolph's last residence. These references, though, only give more charm to a game that is already fantastic: elegant, deep and most probably even more challenging on boards bigger than 10x10.

It was not played as much in my house as it could have been. The game offers potential, although it may require a long, hard session to figure out what exactly that potential is. A decent abstract, but I doubt it will evolve into anything more.

RATING: 7
A clever abstract game of placing tiles and bridges, the aim being to firstly build islands (of exactly 4 contiguous tiles), which is easy enough, and then connect them via bridges - the more islands that are connected, the more bonus points you get. A bridge must go over open water and nothing can then be placed underneath it, so placing tiles so as to threaten to build bridges, and building them, is a great blocking tactic. The neat thing that sets this game apart as well is the rule that you cannot place any tile adjacent to your own island, be it orthogonal or diagonal, but your opponent can. Which creates all manner of open space for your opponent to build into, which you can only block by bridges, which you need to connect to your next island as well. You'll likely need to create mini-islands (less than 4 tiles), which don't score, to host the bridges to get over to the next island, and then you'll have choices on whether to keep space around the mini-islands to turn them into islands, or merely keep them as launch sites for connections, or for blocking. Lots of clever stuff, but it doesn't get bogged down, and the decision tree on the constrained board isn't too long to go through so turns are thinky but not too bad. It's a pretty pure abstract, but as abstracts go I'd happily enjoy exploring this further.

In this two-player abstract, you're trying to connect your colored islands together using bridges, while trying to stop your opponent from doing the same.  It feels like you're very strongly playing off your opponent in this game, as their creation of islands severely restricts their placement while leaving your own unaffected.  For this reason, you may want to hold off creating your own islands, but if you wait too long, you'll lose your opportunity to do so at all.

Don't own many abstracts and so this offers something different for us. Opening moves seem to be played on intuition (chess-like analysis isn't really possible - a plus in my book) and closing moves play out more like the solution of a puzzle. Components are nice but the box is rather big - this makes transport (and therefore play) less likely. Nevertheless, I'm sure we'll be back.

We picked this up cheap and enjoyed it for a little while. But the whilst the wooden bridge were a lovely component the board never sat flat and we constantly struggled with the other pieces sliding off the squares. The bridges are a very loose theme, it was probably too abstract for my tastes.

Another cheap buy from the Works. Also played on yucata.de

A nice easy to pick up abstract type game. Lovely wooden pieces. Basically build islands of 4 squares and join them with bridges to score more points.

Great game, very fast play. We went from trying to have a strategy to running out of room on the board. That is my only real complaint. Very easy game, rules are simple to follow.

Cute abstract.  There are a number of great decisions to make.  A parry here a thrust there.  When I first heard about the game it sounded like this was standing heavily on the shoulders of Alex Randolph (which is just fine, as he's one of the best to emulate).  I was pleased to see a tribute to him in the rules.  

Those that like 80's "themed up" abstracts will love this.

After playing this a few times I'm already starting to really enjoy it. It appeals to the same part of me that enjoys Blokus. I wasn't expecting there to be as much strategy or interesting options when I first read about it but after playing it I'm already starting to see it has quite a bit of depth for a game with such simple rules. It plays quick too which I really like. My only complaint about it is that the board itself isn't that nice compared to the wooden pieces. I was hoping the board would have grooves to fit the tiles into to stop them from moving around and I wish that the squares were more strongly defined on the board, but really that's just a minor complaint. The game itself is really fun.

This is a decent two-player abstract for a change of pace.  I like the strategy in deciding when to add to your landmasses and when to place bridges.  However, it's fiddly in that it can be hard to determine when a move is illegal, the board grid is a bit hard to discern and the pieces slide some, so the components are slightly lacking.

A nice little abstract tile laying game. Plays pretty quickly, which is always a plus since I'm generally not a fan of abstracts. Mary thinks the dark player has an advantage since they potentially get 2 turns in a row if the light player can't play a tile and has already played all the bridges they want to play. That's true, but it seems the light player should be able to avoid that situation?

One player (older) places 2 light tiles. Then other player decides if they want to play light or dark. Dark player places 2 tiles. Then, alternate turns. On your turn either place 2 tiles or place a bridge.
Tile Placement
- 4 orthogonally adjacent = "island"; groupings of 1-3 = "sandbars"
- islands may NEVER touch (orthogonally or diagonally) another tile of same color
- may NEVER place a tile under a bridge
Bridge Placement
- placed to connect 2 tiles of same colors
- may NEVER have tile under middle of bridge
- only 1 bridge foot per tile
- 3 possible orientations (x=feet; - = dead space):
xoo      xo      x
o-o      --      -
oox      ox      x

Last round triggered if either player cannot place tiles AND doesn't want to play bridge. If light player triggers, dark gets a turn. If dark triggers, game ends.

Get points for all islands of your color; more points for groups of islands connected by bridges.
#islands: 1 2 3 4  5  6  7  8
#points:  1 3 6 10 15 21 28 36
Most points wins. Tie-breaker: most islands, then most bridges.

Interesting, really want to play more. A nice and quiet strategy game with a simple look. It is not so easy to get islands build as I thought it would... I like and want to see how my rating will develop with more plays.
With more plays I find it a bit too heavy on the strategy, the fun factor is low. But it is an interesting challenge nevertheless.

Short and simple two-player abstract. The idea is to place tiles on the board in an attempt to create 'islands' of four tiles and then connecting these islands with bridges. The more islands you can continuously connect together, the more points you score. The main area of strategy in the game centres around the decision of whether to place tiles or bridges to connect your islands, or to place them to block your opponents thereby breaking their continuous sequence of islands. The aspect where you can make life difficult for your opponent is fun but overall it's a relatively bland game.

This homage to the creator of the classic game Twixt is a real treat.  The rules are simple but the gameplay is immersive.  It's hard for me to think of even one 2-player abstract that I enjoy, but Ponte del Diavolo is one of them.

RATING: N/A
Sort of a simplified Twixt, with a sort of two-way blocking mechanism (bridges block tile placements, but tile placements block bridges), coupled with some interesting requiremnets to fork like crazy and somehow conneect up all your own islands to score points.

The adjacency rules prevent islands from being even diagonally adjacent, but non-scoring islands (fewer then four spaces) can be diagonally adjacent, leading to some curious choices, since they can still hold bridges and connect other islands.

It's critical to fork out options for the midboard early so you can react and work around it, before your connection is cut off. Once you've lost that, the game is over.

RATING: 7
Not bad for an abstract. I am always so-so on abstracts.  This one does have a couple of things going on so there's some thought that has to be placed into what to do and when.  Still given the size of the board your moves are somewhat decided based on your opponents previous play. A larger board might be better.  I think it might be cool if the game end condition was running out of pieces instead of not being able to play. Would open up what do you want to do and where a bit more I think.

I enjoy playing this 2 player area connection game. Dedicated to Alex Randolph, it's really nothing like Twixt at all.  It is instead a scoring game based on how many islands you can connect together with bridges using specific connection rules.  I'm making a leaded glass version of this game.

Interesting area control game with slightly confusing rules that I'm still harbouring a suspicion we might not be playing entirely correctly...but... otherwise good game with nice solid wood components, which is why it's a bit of a shame that the board itself doesn't sit down too well for the first few plays. That said, this was a bargain at The Works for about £3.99!

Rating may rise or fall with time, but after one play I'm very impressed. Tickles a lot of the same brain-sections as Blokus. Similarly to Blokus, being too aggressive often leads to strong plays by the opponent, but being too timid can leave you shut out. 

After playing a few more games, I'm starting to understand its basics a bit better. Very aggressive (but fun) game with an interesting focus on "negative space" -- forming empty areas which limit or prohibit your opponent from being able to to play.

This is a tile placing game.  The goal is to form islands and then bridge them.  Islands are 4 contiguous tiles of the same color and can't touch any other tiles of that color.  Bridges span 3 spaces and can only be played over open water (no tile in the middle).  At the end of the game you score points for islands.  The more islands bridged the more points your islands are worth.

Tactical 2-player tile placing game set in Venice. The players construct islands and try to connect them with bridges. Tile Placement. Very abstract; tribute to Alex Randolph (Twixt, Ricochet Robots). This is a very fast and challenging abstract, with both offensive and defensive strategy. Lots of replay value.

Very intriguing.  This is the sort of game that I would lose every time I played it, but I like the placement rules, and the tensions from what to place, and when.  I'm bad at seeing all of the consequences of a particular move, which is why I don't like Chess, but I see this having an addictive quality, partly because of its short play time.  If I thought my wife would like it, I'd be all over this game.  As it is, I'll look forward to playing it again.

Played once. A nice-looking two-player abstract, which is a genre I am usually not the biggest fan of (hence I am probably not the best judge for such games). This game feels ok in its category - rules are easy to learn, but have some interesting and not so obvious implications on the game play. I would play it again if I had a chance, but I will not be actively looking for it.

Wow! What a great game! It's like a connection game, but the limits on where you can move make it interesting because every move you make not only help achieve your goals, but also limits your options for later. Forcing or coercing your opponents to make points, so that you can then take advantage of their limitations to make even more points, is an extremely interesting aspect of the strategy. This is the most exciting abstract I've found in a long time.

Being good at go seems to help in this game a lot. Although the games are very different, many of the strategic concerns of go carry over directly.

This is a very good two player abstract game with a lot going on.  The basis of the game is simple: place some pieces and connect them with bridges.  But very quickly the placement rules for how to build an island and what it may be adjacent to makes some hard decisions.  On top of that the bridges which seem primarily to be scoring pieces become perhaps just as important as blocking pieces making almost every turn hard to decide whether you'd rather place tiles of bridges.

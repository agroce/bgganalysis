I'd rate this one far higher if I could figure out how dwarfs can win against a half competent troll player.  As it is no-one will play me, and it just sits in the cupboard.  Very cool playing pieces though.

A chess-esque style game, where you take it in turns to be each of the different teams then add up your totals.
Not bad, but might as well play chess.

RATING: 4
The asymmetric idea is nice. However it's far from balanced. The Trolls normally wins, so you need to play two games with both sides for a balanced score. That's not my idea of a good game!

RATING: 6
Egy nagyon színvonalas sakk-szerű absztrakt logikai játék. 8 db troll küzd 32 törp ellen (egy troll leütése 4-szeresét éri, mint egy törp leütése). A trollok könnyebben ölik meg a törpöket, de a törpök fürgébbek. A sakk nyelvére lefordítva a lépések: troll= király, törp= vezér, de az ütéshez a trollnak elég a törp mellé lépni, a törpnek viszont a troll helyére kell lépni, mint a sakkban.
(Ha egymás mellett többen állnak azonos típusú bábúk, az növeli a hatósugarat). Nagyjából el is mondtam a szabályt:) A játék egyetlen hibájának azt érzem, hogy nagyon aszimmetrikusnak tűnnek az esélyek, talán ezért is kell két partit játszani (mindkét szerepben egy-egy játék) az eredményhirdetés előtt.
A játék kivitelezése kiugróan jó! Szuper doboz, szuper a bábúk megmunkálása. Ritkán emelek ki ilyet, de ez tényleg elsőosztályú.

do not rate it before you play someone who can beat you to the ground with dwarves. there really is a game here, but you do need a few plays. i admit this being a discworld game pushes the rating up a bit :-)
[edit] all the same, the game is broken - rules allow playing forever if someone doesn't want to admit defeat, and in a winning position it still takes forever to actually kill something. a lot much much much better abstract strategies out there

I actually feel the dwarfs have an advantage for semi-experienced players... many comments on this game show people have no idea how the game looks with one side knowing how to use the dwarfs.

Wow. So two people who had played before told me the rules independantly. I read the rules. It just looks to be impossible for the troll player not to win without taking a single casualty. If you follow the strategy of moving a troll towards every position to which the last dwarf moves, the board is too small for you to not reach the dwarves and kill them before they can form a block. This is noughts and crosses (tic-tac-toe) level of assymetry. It is just the same game as King's Table except broken. It is a totally abstract two player game with no real relationship to Terry Pratchett. I love the pieces and I love Terry Pratchett but this game is terrible. I only put three because it was so bad that I am convinced there must be either some strategy that is killer for the dwarves or some rule we missed so I could be convinced to play again. I think the fact that the rules say you have to play as both sides indicates how unbalanced this game is.

My father's first internet purchase, after putting a LOT of thought into what to get for my 17th birthday. ^_^ A lot of strategy, and the abstractness doesn't detract from the highly-intertextual theme in the least (another example - if any were needed - of Pratchett's genius, given this game was designed for use in his novel of the same name).

Interesting. The trolls seem to have an advantage but since you play on both sides this balances out. However it wasn't entirely satisfying. Played numerous games trying to work out the best plan for the Dwarfs in fact both of us played as a team to see what we felt was the best strategy. Now that we think we know it, the desire to play seems to have disappeared. Traded this for Loot and Easter Island.

For sale online, but WAY too expensive. Obviously, I'll be buying this game at some point nevertheless. I'm not very much into the Discworld series, but I'd like to see the twist Terry Pratchett has given on the 'Tafl'-games.

[EDIT]
Bought it. There are a lot of pieces, and they look pretty nice too. Based on that the price seems more reasonable than it used to. It's disappointing though to find out how completely and utterly boring the main game variant is.

Unbalanced to the point that you need to play once as each side for a complete 'game.' I'm not big on abstracts, so that knocks it down further. The components are pretty cool though, as they look and almost have the heft of hewn pieces. 

This is the type of game that could go up in rating with a few games and strategy learned, but there are so many other games out there that are more worthy of my attention...

The game play is also different yet so simple, so it is accessible and yet has depth.  A noble effort to make a chess-equivalent new game, especially considering thisis based on a story element in some books (but not just any books, of course, but the Discworld series)

Asymmetric abstract, largely tactical in nature. The objective for the dwarf player is to transform the deceptively Hnefatafl-like starting formation into a power-projecting blob, while the troll player must do everything to break it up. In this process sacrifices are key on both sides. Regrettably the game still gets drawn out into a slow trench warfare, aggravated by the reliance on player agreement for the end condition.

RATING: 7
I feel more or less completely incompetent while playing this, so in that way (and others) I suppose it's Chess-like. My plans seem utterly transparent and tactical, and when they occasionally work, I'm surprised. The troll-pushing/dwarf-tossing reminds me of Abalone, which is sort of a neutral thing. But despite all that, I like Thud.

Part of it is the resin pieces, which look and feel like in-world artifacts. They're marvelous. Like most cloth boards, I wish this one were an actual board, and like most bagged games, I wish it was boxed, but neither wish bothers me that much.

The asymmetry is excellent, as is playing each side and winning based on total score across both plays. The trolls feel powerful, even singly, and in concert they can cause real problems for the dwarves. The dwarves need some time to muster, but once clumped up they can "shotgun" trolls in several directions, and their mobility is always a threat.

Despite being an abstract, I love the way Thud feels like a game they'd play in Discworld. It also makes me imagine a dwarf-troll battle that would go a very Discworld-y way, with lone dwarves "tossing" themselves at trolls, trolls angrily shoving each other into battle, dwarves milling about until one gets flung from the mob into the fray, etc.

Something about it makes me suspect it'd be best with a regular opponent.

Thump? Thunk? Thwap? Thud!

If you’re unfamiliar with Terry Pratchett‘s Discworld novels, you may not find this post as immediately compelling, but the game Thud, based on a Discworld book, is interesting and requires no knowledge of the books to enjoy. Also, if you’re not familiar with these books, you should seek to rectify that- they’re easily some of the best fiction to have been written in the last decade. They’re known in this country as humorous fantasy but that’s really selling them short. Yes, the characters include witches and trolls and werewolves, but the novels are far more accurately categorized as contemporary satire, pointing out our foibles ranging from the everyday and commonplace to issues as big as the Iraq war.  Some of the recent editions are even downright somber in tone, though not without the occasional incredibly clever pun. Suffice it to say Pratchett is a master storyteller and everyone owes it to themselves to indulge in his world.

OK, enough with the prologue. Thud, created by Terry Pratchett and Trevor Truran, is an apparently chess-like board game based on the game of the same name which has appeared in multiple Discworld novels, particularly Thud! itself, wherein as you might guess, the game is rather a major plot point. The American edition of the game I acquired is quite nice with well-made and attractive components. There are no silly Discworld logos plastered all over the game. The game is instead presented as it is in the book: as an authentic game crafted within the Discworld itself. The board looks like an old fashioned style chess board, albeit with 8 sides, with worn printing and fleur-de-lis a-plenty. The pieces are made of cast porcelain and painted to both look and feel reasonably as though they were carved from rock. The overall presentation is quite nice and gives the game a respectable character, enhancing the play experience.

The game is packaged with one basic set of rules as well as a minor variation for quicker play. After my initial reading of the rules and first gaming session I’m given to feeling that these rules are a bit flawed, for a few reasons, but most significantly being that the game only ends in a draw, upon which both players must agree. However, there is an active online community of Thud! players and many strategy guides and alternate rules have been developed, leading me to feel that the game will hold up for the persistent player.

A full game of Thud! consists of two rounds, with the players switching roles, playing once each as the trolls and dwarves. The eight-sided game board starts out with the 32 dwarves limning the perimeter and the 8 trolls huddled at the center, surrounding the fixed “Thud-stone” piece, which is merely an obstacle in the standard game rules. The pieces each have two kinds of moves: movement and capture. Dwarves can move like a queen in chess, as far in any direction as they like. However they can only capture a troll by building up a line of dwarves which must be greater than the number of empty squares between the dwarf-line and troll in question. The dwarves then capture said troll by launching their lead dwarf at the troll, knocking it out and then occupying its vacated square. Dwarves can only launch when it results in a capture. Trolls can move like a king in chess, only one square in any direction. However, when they move next to any number of dwarves, they capture all dwarves occupying the 8 squares surrounding that troll. Trolls also have a launching move, called shoving, which they can perform only when it results in a capture. Trolls launch by building a line such that the line is equal to or greater than the number of squares the lead troll is going to traverse in the shove, ultimately landing on a square next to one or more dwarves and capturing them all. So the trolls initially seem far more powerful than the dwarves, despite their lumbering slowness. And indeed they are. It’s up to the dwarf player to group his dwarves into a square or rectangle as quickly as possible, from which position they can begin picking off trolls one by one. The match ends when both players agree to a draw, (or after a predetermined number of moves,) and is scored by the number of pieces left on the board, with the dwarves worth one point each for the dwarf player and the trolls worth 4 points each for the troll player. The players total their scores from both matches, with the player with the most points winning the game.

My friend David and I played our first game together the other day. I started as the dwarves and he as the trolls. Being our first game, we definitely learned alot from each other about how to use the other’s pieces when it came time to switch roles for the second match. Having the trolls for the second round, and strongly suspecting that the dwarves have a steeper learning curve, I managed to score more points in the second match, and ultimately winning the game. David and I both felt the game was an enjoyable two hours spent, but we did find something lacking from the initial experience. I’m sure that with experience the game will become much more fairly balanced and that some of the alternate rule-sets will also be quite entertaining. However, I play quite a lot of games, (and drag David along with me,) and having to devote many hours and several gaming sessions to Thud! just to get it to a well-balanced and fully enjoyable state does not bode well for it’s future presence on the game table in my living room. We’ll undoubtably give it many more tries, as it was an enjoyable game, but it’s my personal preference that a game feel fully rich and realized within the first one or two plays.

Thud is published by The Cunning Artificer.

Without a doubt, this game based on Terry Pratchett's Discworld saga, is one of the abstracts that I like the most.  Players are either a gang of dwarves or a group of trolls, that fight each other for the conquest of a checkered room.  Seems like the dwarves, in their greed, dig so deep that encountered a company that they didn't want to find, and decided to ambush the enemy.  Now, they have to fight to keep their treasures, as the trolls would do anything in their hands to maintain control of their sacred space.  The main characteristic of the trolls is their strengh, and the team work is the dwarves' one.  I don't rate it better just because it is a real brain burner, so it is not an every day game, but sure it would be nice to pull it out from time to time.

Thud is a great game, but is definitely not meant for those with short attention spans. My nieces and nephew keep starting games, but lose interest after one round.

Starts out hideously unbalanced in one direction, particularly if you ignore the strategy tips in the manual, turns into a genuinely interesting little game as you discover that it now seems unbalanced in the other direction. It's absolutely essential to play both sides.

I'm a Discworld softie. This game needs the "turnaround" (Where players switch sides and keep total score)to be considered balanced.

RATING: 6
Only played once, but definitely worth a retry.  Seemed rather interesting, though my opponent didn't like the different sides aspect.  You really do need to play it twice to get a 'normal' game in.

A decent abstract.
Worth picking up even if you're not a Discworld fan.

Strangely intriguing game that we bought in person from the Cunning Artificer in Wincanton. It's one of those games where you spend a lot of time trying to pick the mechanics balance apart in your head as it seems really imbalanced, but then you 'swap-ends' and play as each other afterwards so i guess it should balance. Strange but unique game.

A massive brain burner, especially after you switch sides, but otherwise quite clever and good.

Played once.
Pros: Really cool components and interesting asymetric game.
Cons: Reminds me how much I hate perfect information 2 player abstract games.  This game easily breaks down into an extended series of manuver and counter manuvers.  On the dwarven side, it is almost like you are using the pawns as amunition in a bizare gun because most captures are suicidal.  This sounds interesting, but our endgame was just him trying to point his dwarven death ray at me.  He got a couple of my trolls that way, but after that, I could just keep stepping out of the way until we both gave up.  That's not really an attractive endgame.

This is actually a rather good game. The pieces are superb. a nice abstract game. I personally think its as good as the project games.

I love Terry Pratchett’s Discworld series, so I was dubious about playing this when it first came out as I was worried it would tarnish his work.  I was bought it as a Christmas present and was very pleasantly surprised to find that there was actually a good game behind the name.

Although it looks like Hnefatafl, the game plays very, very differently.

Two player abstract. Idea probably borrowed from Hnefatafl, and set to Discworld universe.

Not as much of a gimmick as it may at first seem. It is generally a fun and thoughtful game which I think would benefit from a wood or slate board.

Very much like the old 'Viking Game'. A head to head - htere are better around.

RATING: 7
OK it is similar to the Viking Game but the pieces look great and the Discworld theme attracts a lot of people to it.  It's pretty accessible too.

May not be the deepest abstract ever, but still decent fun. I also rather like the theme, so that's an added bonus for me.

I bought the reissued (cheaper!) set - it's still beautiful! An interesting and tricky game, and a  welcome relief from more intricate rulesets!

Have only played this once, when I first got it. Has been sort of forgotten about since; I remember it was similar to Hnefatafl (AKA The Viking Game). Must try it again soon!

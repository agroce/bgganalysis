RATING: 6
SCS system, very simple.
The siege of Bastogne at company scale, no stacking.
Great fluidity in movement without sticking Ezocs.
Some good and clever ideas like the road move.
Players must be aware of the turn sequence and movement and infiltration implications to play it capably.
IMO The forest defence penalty to artillery fire makes no sense. Trees absorb the explosion caused by shells and more important put the target out of direct observation making the fire less efective.
I truly believe that is worse to be in the receiving end of a heavy artillery barrage in the open!
The penalty effects of artillery to the armour units caught in forest is weird.
The movement rate to leg units in forest make no sense at this scale. The armour can move faster than infantry in the woods tangle!!!! (During the game the german infantry crawl some forest meters each day turn!)
But, if Despite these issues you can hold that, the game is fun and the artillery phases are full of tension.
Playing time (between 2 experient players): 6+ hours

El sistema SCS me parece excelente, fácily rápido. Este me parece el juego indicado para empezar con él.
 Este juego en concreto tiene una tabla de combate que penaliza muchísimo al atacante, de tal forma que favorece las retiradas pero no se logran pérdidas sustantivas salvo en situaciones de asedio.
 La falta de ZdC de ciertas unidades crea confusión al principio, más por falta de costumbre que por un diseño malo. Los arrasamientos permiten unos movimientos de avance combinados muy interesantes, pues las primeras unidades arrasan y la siguiente oleada avanza y vuelve a arrasar,con lo que no siempre es conveniente estar en contacto con el enemigo (para hacer movimiento de explotación la ficha debe de estar fuera de ZdC enemiga). Además la situación de contacto con el enemigo permite a la artillería enemiga bombardear.
 Muy bien diseñado. Aun siendo sencillo tiene mucha sustancia. Creo que es facil saberse las reglas, pero no tanto dominar la técnica y la estrategia para vencer. Tiene más sustancia de la que en un principio puede parecer.

Bastogne: Screaming Eagles under Siege is the first SCS tittle I have played.  While, the SCS titles are billed as lower complexity wargames with lower counter density, there is certainly enough meat to the game to hold my interest.  The road march phase allows considerably more  movement than other wargames that I am used to and the artillery phase can be very effective.  Overall, I have been very pleased with Bastogne.

The SCS system is very easy to learn. The series takes on the 101st at Bastogne and succeeds in spades. Played this with three other (two per side) We all loved it. Two of the players were wargamer newbies and they picked it right up. Awesome game and system.

RATING: 6
Playing this game was frustrating, because it does a lot of stuff right. The early game is awesome, with the Germans driving into the teeth of American paratroopers and an armored combat command, dealing with constricted terrain and US artillery and lousy roads - sort of a microcosm of the entire Battle of the Bulge. SCS is a good, playable system, and the "strategic" road march rules are a very clever solution to a tricky design problem which produces a lot of good results.

Unfortunately, for me the game collapses under its own weight in the last half, much like The Mighty Endevour did (neither game is short, or short enough anyway). As is so often the case with The Gamers, it falls down on the victory conditions. The Germans have to secure the roads on the last turn, but this turns into a mess of hunting down rogue US units (no line of supply rules), working out all combinations of possible march moves, and (for the Germans) grinding out the last few battles required to win, or (for the US) having a few units left in range to interdict the roads. After the major clashes of the first half, the second half of cat-and-mouse securing is a serious letdown.

If the Germans could win as soon as the roads are secure, or if there were some sort of sudden-death victory, or something more nuanced, this could be a really great game. I disagree with the designer's notes, I think some supply rules would have helped to deter both German unsupported raids into Bastogne and lone isolated Americans hunkering down to jump on supply roads right at the end. I really think the second half of the game just doesn't work very well.

So for me, anther SCS game with a lot of promise that can't quite deliver. Gamers' games always seem to have VC problems - coarse victory conditions layered with a couple hacks to prevent ahistorical play - and Bastogne seems to suffer more than most.

(2009-07-10) I played the first scenario of MMP's Bastogne: Screaming Eagles Under Siege twice solo. The first game was an easy US win as their artillery blew away most of the German first wave, and so the powerful German reinforcements, while they could blast whatever they wanted, had to many targets to work. The second game was just the opposite as the US artillery wasn't nearly as effective, the German artillery got their licks in, and the US paratrooper reinforcements came in with the Panzers lined up waiting for them.

Based on the ratings here on BGG I think I'm in the minority with my initial impression. Attrition seems to high, movement allowances to high for the tanks in the woods, luck to much a factor.

I think I actually like the old SPI Bastogne - The Desperate Defense better.

Interestingly, the Screaming Eagles scale is 1 day and 400 meters, while the Desperate Defense is 1/2 day and 850 meters (I think). Both maps show about the same area (though the Desperate Defense has more to both the North and South).

Un bon opus SCS, avec une situation intéressante pour les deux camps en début de partie. Après le 5e tour, le rôle de l'américain est plutôt frustrant puisqu'il se borne à conserver sa ligne en voyant fondre ses effectifs. Il peut néanmoins se permettre quelques contre-attaques mais avec parcimonie. L'Allemand a lui l'initiative et il se doit de la conserver absolument afin de pouvoir l'emporter.
Le matériel est superbe même si en fin de partie la couleur "pastel" des pions fatigue les yeux avec le peu de contraste de la carte.
Seul bémol, c'est long (8 à 10 heures), et comme pour tout SCS, il faut patienter et s'ennuyer un peu lorsque l'autre joue...avec 3 phases de mouvement, par route, normal et exploitation on a le temps de "clipper" les pions d'autres jeux...

Was concerned about fast movement but really didn't happen.  Very fun and balanced and hard and tense for both players.   Either side thought the other was going to win.  Gives a good feel for being surrounded when the US hunkers down around Bastogne.  Germans are on a tight rope.  Another hit for the SCS series. An old gamer, playing over 45 years.

Oh man I wanted to love this, I so did.  The basic gameplay rules are very good and the tension from road-movement really works.  Plus artillery - always my favorite branch - really chews you up in this game.  However, the downtime between turns is agonizing and by the end you really can't remember what your plan was anymore.  A chit-pull mechanism would have saved this.  Such a shame

Excellent game. The odd interstate highway like movement takes a bit to get used to. However it completely makes sense, emphasizing road and esp crossroad control. 

   Some attention to the effects of bridges might be useful, perhaps making them a move point In the road move phase.

RATING: 8
After one complete game, initial impressions are positive. This is my first SCS game, and I quite like the system. The ability to move through EZOC's, albeit at the expense of extra movement, breaks up the unrealistic zoc-chess so typical of most hex & counter wargames where chumpy infantry units hold up entire armored columns for days at a time.

That said, in this particular game, the road march rules feel a bit strange, though it's important to keep the scale and time frame in mind. It's also explained in the designer's notes, so some of the comments about the "autobahn" are IMHO simply misplaced. The artillery is a bit of a dice-fest and is always going to target armor. Did that actually happen? I don't know enough about the battle to say.

Still, overall I think it's a fine game that can be played in two 5-6 hour sessions, and is a good introduction to the series in general.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I need to play this more to formulate a solid rating. Consider this one preliminary, and please take it with a grain of salt.

I'm a huge fan of SCS in general, and though I loved most aspects of this game (especially the streamlined no-frills approach to SCS), the road movement and the scale both seemed a bit "off."  I'm not sure why stacking should be 1 unit per hex given unit and hex scale, or why 88's only fire 2 hexes when in fact the average infantry LMGs should be able to fire this far. Fog? Knowing Dean's attention to detail, this was probably an intentional design decision, but I'd like to have heard more about it in the designer notes. That said, I appreciate simplicity, and the stacking rules help here. The road movement means counting the number of places that road types differ becomes much more important than movement rates or map distances, which felt odd and gamey.

Despite my reservations (and they are pretty minor) I love the game situation, and I think this game will probably go on to generate a "cult following" much like Fallschirmjaeger.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Another SCS title made great by the game specific rules.  Bastogne's road movement rules are a hoot! The game changes its personality too.  You can play a game where the board is cluttered with units, or where both sides are maneuvering and trading counterpunches.  It all depends on where the Americans draw their perimeter, and whether the Germans can trap any units outside of the perimeter.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The SCS system here brings out the interplay of infantry, armour and artillery, so players need to master their combined-arms tactics to do well. Both sides feel the pressure in the game, which is a good sign of a tight game design. The minimalist rules also make it an easy game to learn and absorb.

The only real drawback is the length of the game (it's not exactly short) combined with the strategic situation (which presents players with limited choices - there are only so many ways to skin a cat). I fear this could affect replayability.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game is unusually simple for a wargame;  designer Dean Essig stripped out every superfluous rule.  This doesn't change the fact that it's a tense struggle.  Every time you use artillery ammunition it's like giving a pint of blood, but how can you not use it when the opportunities beckon?

A decent game and a great introduction to wargaming for newcomers but the SCS system is a little flavourless for my taste and MMP's aesthetics are bland to say the least.

Great game. I think it is an excellent transitional game from basic wargaming to OCS, as it includes most OCS elements except supply concerns. It is also one of the more remarkable battles from the bulge. It represents the historical action well - but it is also possible for the germans to take Bastogne if they are careful, wiley, and a bit lucky.

Played the Introductory Scenario and the full Battle for Bastogne. This is the first SCS game I have played. The system is a much simplified version of OCS that delivers, within a shorter time frame, most of what its big brother offers. The Battle for Bastogne is a meaty scenario that requires a lot of careful thought. As the German player you simply cannot afford to make mistakes as the victory conditions require you to hold at least one victory route to win a minor victory - and a lone US unit is enough to deny you control of a route. All in all, I find the combination of the victory conditions, the lack of supply rules and the ease of road movement to be frustrating for the Germans - I would attempt to play them once more, but another major victory for the Americans would put me off the game for good.

Never have I been so thoroughly disappointed with a game!

I P500'd the game. Even though the game was an SCS game, which are all low on the complexity level, using a modified/updated game system left over from the 1970s (PG Guderian-esque), I saw that the game was going to be a company level game with a small scale map. I expected SCS with MORE detail than usual, from a tactical point of view. What I got was LESS detail, to the point where all supply rules were dispensed, and the tactical detail I thought would be added nowhere to be found. Where I was initialy droolin', I ended up with dry-mouth.

The one-and-only game play was an excersise in hoping for lucky artillery die-rolls. The victory conditions are laughable, when you realise that with very few German mobile units left on-map at the end game, there is very little to keep the US player from "sliding" a few US mobile units through German ZOCs so they can run amok in the German rear-area and just sit on the victory roads. The Germans don't have the units, much less ones that are strong enough, to dislodge them.

I was lucky that we played with my friend's punched copy. I immediately sold my unpunched copy, taking a $10 loss (when you factor in the shipping).

RATING: 5.5
As a game, it has lots of excitiment and tension. But as history....While it may capture the mental effects of the battle, I beleive it fails to simulate the spatial reality. The One day turn seems too long for the combatants reaction abiliity, especially with the use of Road Movement. The Germans can see all the holes in the defense and then use the road move followed by regular move  to exploit that god like info. Also those  Tanks are way too mobile among the trees for my tastes ( iirc they move faster than the infantry through the woods!. As a result the actual defense lines are not tenable and the game positions do not seem to match the real battle map positions.

Would've been good had it come out in the 70's, in fact it looks a lot like one of the Bulge games from an old SPI quad I had. Small 1/2" counters, no supply rules, no battalion/regimental integrity, no combined arms bonus. A special rule "ignore Task Force Abrams" for victory purposes near the end. Panzers and infantry zip around the countryside like there was an autobahn instead of snow clogged trails and dirt roads. A waste of time, completely.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Initial rating based on partially complete solo play to learn rules.  The game is easy to learn, but takes a surprising time to play due to the need to plan against surprises due to the road march rules.  If the US player doesn't cover every key intersection with an outpost, the Germans can get a battlegroup into a weak sector very quickly.  

Barrage die rolls seem to be a key (as successes result in DGs and possible step losses) so players have to carefully weigh remaining artillery ammo against the need to disrupt key units (especially if on a road, as it will slow down road marches).  There are a lot of good decisions in this game.  It's surprisingly deep and captures the desperation on both sides during the early phases of the siege of Bastogne.

Started out liking this a lot.  After having played the campaign, think I've gotten value for my money but can't really see myself playing it again.  First, it's a dicefest, pure and simple.  The most critical events in the game are the 30 or so shots by the heavy artillery. These will inevitably go for the strongest units as there are no LOS restrictions. As a result, tanks will suffer most from artillery.

The scale is semi-tactical but there is no notion of combined arms as for example a full strength tank unit can't be stacked with infantry - it will always be attacked alone, and it will always be the strongest attacker in any terrain.  (And it will also be as vulnerable to wood splinters in the forest as any infantry unit, which is absurd.)  The German 88s are almost as good as heavy artillery and also gain the woods modifiers, which means they are best used as area saturation weapons against tanks or infantry units in forest.  Bizarre.

The vaunted or hated infinite road movement is generally not so much of a problem - you have to learn to block roads, that's it.  That said, the way in which the US shifts its defense to meet the (fixed) reinforcements reminds me more of a flock of birds than an army.  And once the perimeter shrinks, if a path is uncovered that leads around the map (and typically that's not the roads but the trails!) you can have units marching from one end of the map to the other (50 hexes), conduct full normal movement and attack.    In the end, the game turned into a railway scheduling exercise for the Germans as they shunted blocking units out of towns onto side roads, marched everyone through who was supposed to cross the map, and then marched the blockers back into place in the movement phase.  This not only leads to bizarre perfect movement plans, it also makes the end game very boring for the US player.  Part of the problem is that one side gets three movement phases in a row. Interleaving them differently would have helped a lot.

Overall, hyperactive (like much SCS), tense, exciting, but also a crapshoot, unreal and unrealistic, and quite long (we finished the campaign in three sittings because of a concession after 3/4 of the game). In addition, setup (by hex by unit IDs which are tiny and for the US printed in black on dark olive) is a terrible pain, which makes me loath to even go back to the small scenarios, they take almost as much time to just select the units set up as to play.  These last two drag it down from a 5 to a 4 - most likely way to play this again is if I can convince the other guy to set it up before play.  Too bad.

RATING: 4
I'm underwhelmed by Bastogne. It's not that I think the game has faults. It is more that I can't work up any enthusiasm for it. Maybe the SCS system is a bit too vanilla for me. Maybe the subject matter doesn't draw me in. Probably it is a combination of these things.

RATING: 7
I am a sucker for design elegance.  This has it in spades.  The thing about SCS games is that they are so simple and instinctive (for anyone who has ever played a hex and counter wargame) that the focus is all on the game play.  Bastogne is not a brain burner in the way that OCS games can be (not for their rules but for the number of things you have to get right to avoid disaster), but it is not easy to play well.

I tend towards complexity in my tastes but this is a brilliant and clean design.

4 / 5 - Very Good

A lot to like about this: easy to learn, hard and very tense to play. I love the way it gives the players the chance to explore combined arms tactics in a no-fuss, pared-down manner which nevertheless feels historically correct. Maneuver with your armour, defend with your infantry and choose your artillery targets carefully! However in the final reckoning there are just too many units to control here for me to feel entirely comfortable: the result is too long and too fiddly. Worse after several plays I'm starting to think that far too much rides on the luck of the US roll for additional airtrikes and artillery ammo: lucky rolls here will destroy the Germans in no short order. An intermediate length scenario with half the units would be a huge boon.

It's a good game but really highly fluid.  This takes some getting used to.  Hard to play by VASSAL because units can cross the entire map in a single turn which may be affecting my view of the game.

Upgraded to 6.8 after third play.  It seems to be a pretty well balanced game.  It does take a while to make your move in the first half of the game, but moves more quickly as the armies get ground down and the American circle gets smaller.  If you like lots of attacks and building up a dead pile this game is for you.

Played the all the scenarios in the rule book (not the variants). All of them solitary. The main scenario took me several nights to finish. At the end, Germans did not have the strenght required to win the game. They couldn't control the Victory Routes, nor enter in Bastogne. 

I did not played the German side keeping in mind the VP I could get by avoiding some units to be eliminated. I pushed too hard to get into Bastogne, but American defenses were very well deployed. It wasn't a smart move, but a lot of fun. 

The terrain makes relatively easy to defend the town, therefore it makes no sense to try to get there. Germans have to keep they forces around Bastogne, well positionned and then receive the points for every unit retreated. Americans don't have enough power to push against well deployed German positions. Is this historically accurate? I don't know. Anyway, a good game, even solitary.

After playing, I barely have the mental energy to construct a comment. A completely absorbing struggle, impeccably balanced and fantastically designed. This is what hex and counter is all about. I expect this will become a favourite of many. Playable in 6-8 hours.

RATING: 7.5
This is a tentative rating after playing the first two scenarios, which were very short. This is definitely a bare-bones addition to the SCS series. I played the first scenario in less than an hour (even with the a-historical artillery, the Germans really faced a daunting task). The Germans won the second scenario with a couple of really lucky, last-minute rolls which forced the Americans out of the target cities. It's a good system, but I think that some sort of supply rule--beyond the artillery ammo--should have been included.

My first SCS game and it did not dissapoint. The core rules are extremely straightforward and intuitive, and the game specific rules don't add that much more. I'm officially hooked on SCS now.

RATING: 8
Nice game, seems tough on the Germans (as it should be!).

Be sure to use all capabilities early in the game, especially overruns and exploitation. Use your artillery to try to DG attack targets, that is the only way to get them out of woods and towns.

RATING: 7
Enjoyable installment to the SCS series.  Bastogne is a low complexity game, even by SCS standards, but still delivers an interesting situation for both players.  Due to the scale of ten daily turns (for the campaign game), it dispenses with supply rules.  The CRT is bloody, so be prepared for piles of dead units.

Some have criticized the game for having such high movement rates in the rugged Ardennes.  Having toured the battlefield, this part of the Ardennes is much more open than the other areas of the battlefield, therefore more suitable for mechanized operations. (The photo on page 8 of the Bastogne rules is a good example).  With that said, the Road March rules do make it seem like the Germans are zipping along at will.

Bottom line: Good old-skool wargaming fun.

一个优秀的游戏。SCS系列作为一个中规中矩的游戏适合普通玩家推演，但是系统本身的不足，则很难让老司机们满意。而本作则是两者通吃。游戏对巴斯托尼的危险处境和两军的特点都有较好的表现，值得一玩。

I like series games and I like the SCS. Nice and simple rules ,so you can concentrate on the game. Most games are at the same time large enough that it is a challenge to play a good game, a challenge you can take on without looking up too much rules. Bastogne is especially good, very fluid situation with great drama.

Basically no stacking gives a different feel than other SCS titles, but has some strange effects, like the impossibility to add a MG company to an inf company...

Movement should take into account Leg, Weeled or tracked vehicles - as it is, Tanks end up being the best for forest...

German "free" artillery seems overpowered...

RATING: 9
Very tentative rating, I suspect it may go up as I finish more games.

I really like this game so far but one reservation I have is the choice of scale, which works for the full scenario (it limits the number of turns) but it leads directly to the Road March rule, which is a fine rule in effect but playing it turn by turn is very time consuming...certainly less time consuming than playing a 20 or 30 turn game, which this one could have been if it followed the FJ model, but still, the road/leapfrog calculus has to be run through by both players turn after turn for alot of units.  

I do like the no-supply rules choice, but surrounded units, locally surrounded or in a pocket, suffer no adverse effects.  In fact the only advantage to flanking someone is the possibility of forcing a step loss in retreat...since the combat table is littered with D1s but precious few D2s, this is a key indicator for operations...you really need those retreat forced step losses to win as the Germans.

Lastly I was surprised to see how important artillery is...the German panzers are barely on the map for 4 turns...the rest of the game is about position and arty blasting.

The complaints about the road march rules are way off.  The US players has a buzillion 2-4-6 units.  Just put one in or adj. to the key road junctions and German long range movement is immediately shut down.

Armor in forest is more likely to be spotted and destroyed by enemy aircraft than armor on roads out in clear terrain. Really? Once artillery annihilates a unit, which happens all too often, you can't switch targets. What happened to the spotters? I could go on, but you get the point. Fool me three times with SCS and I have had enough. Some of the poorest design work in the hobby. I refrained from giving it a "1" out of professional courtesy.

RATING: 7
The upside:
-It's always an upside for me if it's about the Battle of the Bulge.
-Great design of the challenges of this particular campaign: the artillery barrages can be terrifying or the vital use/blocking of roads.
-Several scenarios to ease into the campaign.

The downside:
-There's a little more luck than I expect in a wargame. We're using dice not only just for combat, but also for artillery and reinforcements for example.
-Frustrating middle to late game, where I felt the game was decided and just had to keep going without hopes of victory.

very interesting game.
Screaming Eagles and armored task forces have to hold on Bastogne, cut the victory roads and make some losses to german kampfgruppe without to be destroyed themselves: 
German player has to attack but too many looses are bad for victory points. And 4 armored gruppen leave the map regularly !!
The task is not easy for any side.
really one good SCS game

Solid SCS title that does a good job of gaming the most well known aspect of the Battle of the Bulge.  If you like SCS then you'll like this game.

I am just no longer a big fan of the beer and pretzel hex and counter system.  Traded it away and I don't miss it, nor will I get another game from this system.

SCS Bastogne is just plain fun.

The game also seems to be an excellent intro to the system and hex and counter wargaming in general.  The components are top notch.  The rulebook is glossy full colour and the counters are well printed and organized.  Finally the map is outstanding.

The gameplay is quick and fun.  You'll be blasting away in no time.  Probably my favourite SCS title.

As of 11/6/16, I'm trying this out solo and I'm on turn 3. Fairly easy to setup and play (which is why I really enjoy the smaller SCS games). 

Road March rule: As long as you play "realistically" (set up defenses around Bastogne and not just the east of Bastogne) road march rules prevent any weird situations to come up. I read the Bastogne chapters from "A Time for Trumpets" to gain more insight into the battle, and the road march rules seem, to me, to reflect the ability and necessity for commanders to send out ad-hoc "strike forces" to bolster defenses or to slow down German advances. 

This rules achieves that and allows the American player to conduct mini offensives or to bolster defenses in key sectors to spoil and slow down German advances, just like in history. 

Anyway, fun and small SCS game. Wish there was more of these one-map, one counter sheet games!

Simple, elegant design, but ...  Strange game, extremely fluid.  For a small game, lots of time to set up and do turns.  Counters hard to read for set up.  Unit colors are confusing.  Innovative turn sequence?

This is a good, quick SCS title, and a great title to teach hex-and-counter wargaming on.  My only problem with it is the finicky victory rules.  They've caused some very strange situations to arise, but I can understand why the designer chose them, given the scale of the game.

My first wargame and introduction to SCS from MMP. Great and simple system that recreates a very known battle from World War II and is doing it in a very efficient way. If you don't want a very complex system and wish to focus on smaller conflict with easy rules this game is ideal and the whole SCS system is very friendly.

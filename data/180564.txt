My son's first foray into Carcassonne. He loves it! And I'm okay with it. 
The decision to remove the farmers seems to have lessened anguish and thinkiness. That's not bad.

RATING: 6
1st play: Enough like base Carcassonne to be simple to teach and play, enough novelty that it's fun in it's own right.  I doubt there will be enough expansions for this in the long term, but I had quite a bit of fun playing it.  It removes farmer scoring which should make it easier for my kids to get a handle on, and with the dice, it should allow for a little more luck.  Pleasant gameplay.

2nd play: I got my butt kicked again, but the combats are constant and intense - which fits the Star Wars theme.  The game is certainly more swingy than regular Carc, but it plays fast so I don't mind that - it actually makes it more exciting.

RATING: 4
Easily the worst Carcassonne game I've played. The portion of luck in the disputes are absolutely devastating and the flow of this game is very compromissed by these stupid battles for the planets. If you want to play a different Carcassonne play South Seas or any expansion for the base game, pass this one for good.

Pros: it is Carcassonne therefore easy to play and to explain to newbies, a game lasts about 30 min. The Star Wars setting where you can contest is the main pro of this version. But
Cons: that's it, nothing else is new in this game. The fighting part could have been significantly improved whilst remaining quick to play. I mean, the Risk d6 system is quite obsolete... and for a reason...

RATING: 5
It must have seemed a good idea to somebody to give a game inspired by a medieval French city a re-theme based on the most successful sci-fi franchise in movie history.  It was probably Hans im Gluck’s accountant.  So…roads become space routes, city areas become asteroid fields, monasteries become planets, and fields become empty, worthless space.  There are a couple of innovations.  Instead of everyone playing a nameless French town planner, in Star Wars Carc we are characters good, bad and mercenary from the movies.  Many of the tiles have symbols relating to those factions, which mostly just score bonus points, but do matter when it comes to contests for the planets.  Ownership of a planet can be contested by placing your meeple on it and chucking some dice; a symbol of your faction grants an extra dice.  

Star Wars Carc is surprisingly similar to its parent.  The fields are always the fiddliest element in any version of Carcassonne, so doing away with them has streamlined the game somewhat.  Set against that is the dicing for planetary control, which feels a clunky interruption to the flow of play.  

Production quality is decent. The galaxy far, far away has inspired rather bland and generic artwork.  Arkham Carcassonne cannot be far off.

Enjoyed the experience but I missed the fields from regular Carcassonne. The Stars Wars theme is decent enough and the dice rolling for planets is daft but fun. Guys at the table thought this trumped the original but I'd rather play Carcassonne on the iPad with my wife. Certainly not bad though.

Star Wars : Carcassonne certainly adds something new to the Carcassonne family of games. That is the idea of combat. It follows the same general rules but does not have any farmer analogues. And now when you either through contact via trade routes (roads) or asteroid fields (castles) you can battle each other with dice rolls to gain control of those areas. Granted it isn't heavy combat (roll one dice for each meeple you have  and person with the highest number of pips on a single dice among the die rolled wins and pushes the opponent's meeples off) but it does add that mechanic. Plus there can be combat for control of planets (monasteries) as well. The only down sides are that the theme is VERY pasted on here. Was there really any demand for a Star Wars themed Carcassonne? In addition this version looks the worst of any of the other editions as 85% of it is just a black field of empty space. Fun but unless you are a true Star Wars fan there isn't any reason to seek it out.

The increased focus on the planets was fun.  The dice probably do horrible things for the game balance, but having something to battle over as opposed to just dropping tiles and hoping to draw the good ones felt right.

Not a tremendous amount to say.  It's Carcassonne with the added mechanism of battling for contested regions.  The battle mechanism is fair, but typically pretty anti-climatic

+ This game adds some direct conflict to Carcassonne, which is great to introduce new players to games with more direct interaction (attacks) and the timing of those. (stealing the Planet the other playing has spent a lot of effort building)
+ Entertaining for quick and light plays.

- Lacks the depth of expanded Carcassonne.

I really enjoy Carcassonne and the art for this is all quite pretty.  There is a lot more luck than in some of the other versions as much comes down to what tile you draw.  In the original with the use of farmers you could get decent value from most tiles and it felt more about making the best of the tiles you got than drawing well.  Still its weakness (no farming) is also its strength as that makes it a simpler game to teach and not merely a game where the experienced players will win by farming.  Similarly the rolling dice to resolve conflicts makes the game much less interesting strategically but makes it easier for new players to not lose all their points through being out maneuvered.  Possibly my least favorite Carc version I have tried but a great one to introduce new players too and still lots of fun.

Of course there's a Star Wars version of Carcassonne. This plays pretty similar to the original with the major changes being adding a bunch of planets (that score similarly to cloisters), taking out pasture scoring, and giving everyone the ability to combat each other for territory. The combat basically is just a dice roll so it's pretty random. This is a step away from "pure" Carcassonne but the theme works well enough to add some flair to an old classic.

Surprisingly this felt a lot better than original Carcassonne, even though I was skeptical on paste-on theme. But leaving out the annoying farmers that generate way too much points and including fights between meeples really did improve the game. It is now a lot more random and not so calculative, but for me that is just fine no need to count tiles.

Much more interesting than regular Carcassonne (although I have never played with any of the expansions.  I really like the combat that occurs, which I am confident many Carcassonne fans will not appreciate.  The theme integrates better than I thought it would, but at the end of the day this is still Carcassonne.  Glad to have a copy of this, and I expect to get many more plays of this one going forward.

I was really surprised at how a few seemingly minor changes to a game can really, really impact it so negatively. Really not a fan of this implementation at all. Also, the asteroid fields look WAY too similar to the plain parts of the tile. I do wear glasses but I really struggled to match up the tiles in poor lighting.

I play a Mega Game with 2 copies. I added a "rogue droid" character, CJ69C, in my favourite colour, so we can do 3 teams: Empire vs. Rebels vs. Bounty Hunters. 

Even though I'm so bad at rolling dice, I love it! The battling / dice rolling make it both exciting and mostly frustrating but sometimes, not often but sometimes, exhilarating.

There are also new elements, as point are no longer shared or based on majorities, but galaxies, trade routes and planets are actually "fought" for by means of dice. Number of dice are determined by the number of meeples and their size (there is a large meeple in play, which counts for two meeples) but also by

This game reignited my interest in Carcassonne.  I didn't realize I wanted "Risk" like battles in my Carc, but it actually works out pretty well.  You get some points even for losing the battles, and you get your meeple back, which helps mitigate the loss.  Excited to try the Rebels v. Empire variant next time we have 4 players.

Not for purists, it is Carcassonne but whenever one of your meeples would have shared an area with an opponents you now fight with dice. You can invade each others cathedrals, i mean planets too.

I like it as much as the regular game, which is to say i -prefer it over other family staples such as Settlers or Ticket to Ride, but its not a game i spend much time thinking about.

Without farmers I at first thought something too important was missing and to be honest it does take tension out of the game for me which is a minus. But I love the planet battles, random though they are and this ultra light game, while not putting painful descisions your way is usually a nice back and forth affair. The team game is good too and should be utilized by owners of the game. I think Storm Trooper is a dumb idea for a character though.

Well, I love Star wars, I like Carcassonne. This is a good combination. A bit short maybe - even though it's just as many tiles as 'the city' (& for that matter, every base carcassonne game), the fact that there is only 3 different places to put meeples, it feels like it's obvious where meeples should be placed.

Carcassonne: Star Wars takes out farmers and adds some basic dice combat without making the game all about combat.  It's a nice change to have some situations where players will fight over territory, but I like that it's never mandatory and doesn't come up a ridiculous amount of the time.  Each battle has a chance to change the outcome of the game, but battles never seem to be the deciding factor.  Quite enjoyable take on Carcassonne that doesn't drift too far from the basics.

Well, this is the first Carcassonne game that I play. I think this game is good. I like the situational mechanic of the fights and I it's a filler for me. Before we start our session of gaming, when my family is taking a shower or finishing something else, I seek for who is already ready and play this game with him.
Works fine with 2 and 3 players. I never played with more, but I think it would gets too slow and you don't have so much thing to do in others people turn.

Falls into the same category as the "around the world" type of Carcassonne games (e.g. South Seas, Old West).  Lighter than the "normal" Carcassonnes (Original, Hunters & Gatherers, New World, City).   Not as much control as the normal ones.   Much more hollerin' than in regular Carcassonne due to the battles.

But... fun and fast for what it is.

I'm not the biggest Carcassonne fan, so adding a Star Wars theme on top doesn't necessarily make it any better. In fact, if anything, the game looks much uglier than the vanilla version. I guess if you like rolling dice, maybe that battle element is more fun. But the Star Wars artwork and theme is so minimal that you suspect whether or not there were certain limitations placed on them by Disney on what they could and could not depict.

RATING: 6.8
Okay, the idea is stupid or crazy or whatever, but the game is fun as long as you don't mind some additional randomness for the theme. No wonder the game is not simply 'Carcassonne Star Wars' but 'Carcassonne Star Wars edition' as the scoring is a lot more reminiscent of good ol' Carc than in any differently themed Carc spin-offs. The two main differences are
:d6-1: it has no farm scoring AT ALL - no long-term planning necessary, therefore it's the second "age: 7+" spin-off after South Seas (the rest is age: 8+), and
:d6-2: It is about WARS. Or battles. Duels. Whatever. So there are no ties when two meeple meet in the same feature - as soon as they meet (as a result of placing a tile that connects them) the ownership is decided by some rather friendly dice fight (where even the loser scores some points). Planets (cloisters in the original) are worth lots of points and get contested very often, as this time even if you place one of the 8 surrounding tiles to a planet, you can place your meeple to the planet instead of the tile, even if it is already occupied by another player's meeple (and then another dice fight takes place). Your character's (Yoda, Luke, Storm trooper, Vader, Boba Fett) alliance symbol also can help you in the fights... and that's it. It's harmless and fun even though some Carc purists might be complaining because of the luck factor introduced by the dice.

A very light(saber) game in the universe of Star Wars.  Not much in the way of strategy does this game offer, hmmmm.  But, it's a fun introductory game of Carcassonne with a Star Wars theme. Welcome to the gateway of gaming! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I'm not a huge Carcassonne fan. I don't own the regular game (though I do have and enjoy Carcassonne: the Castle) and I burnt out on it on iOS when it was clear that the main strategy is to just be a jerk all the time. Nor am I a huge fan of Star Wars branded games. My view on the Star Wars movies is well known to anyone who's ever been near me when someone made the mistake of bringing the topic up. So why did I buy this?

I was in Italy, in a game store, looking for something of a souvenir. My choices were: something I could get cheaper anywhere, something in Italian, some unknown quantity (I had no way of looking anything up at the time). Star Wars Carc stood out because it had English rules, wasn't terribly expensive, and at the moment is not available in the US. 

This is Carcassonne. Trade routes are roads, asteroid fields are cities, planets are monasteries. There are no farms. You play as various SW characters (Yoda, Luke, Vader, Stormtrooper, Boba Fett). The main difference is, should you join two occupied segments together, they battle for control, rolling dice, which is kind of neat. Also planets are hotly contestable, as you can jump on them even after they're played and fight for control.

It's short and it's super-swingy. Fans of Carcassonne may not like it because of the dreaded dice. Fans of Star Wars will enjoy a lot of the nonsense happening. It's a reasonable time-waster but not essential.

I don't really like Carcassonne in general, but this SW version is a gem. I love SW but don't buy all SW related. It's just that this games is perfect for children too, since you add rolling dices and fights, the art is still very functional but nice. It's just a game I would play quite often, and which makes us laugh and enjoy every time we play.

I found this version to be pretty annoying. Some of it may come from the fact that it has come out in a time where Star Wars marketing has become incredibly annoying for me. It is pretty much what you expect from Carcassonne except for the new rules for what used to be the Monastery tiles. I am not a fan of battling over the planets at all. Also if you get into a battle that rolls ties several times and your opponent is rolling more dice than you that can really take the feeling of triumph of keeping a superior force at bay away.

For a fairly pasted on re-theme this one actually fits quite well, occupying trade route and planets does work and feels a bit like Star Wars. It definitely hits all of the same beats as classic Carcassinne but unfortunately the black 'space' tiles are much less interesting to look at on the board.

While battling and dice-rolling initially sounds like a horrible direction to take classic like carc, the changes it makes to claim-jumping are actually quite interesting. Properties are inherently stronger or weaker based on player identity, so it's not all blind output randomness. Worth a few more plays (preferably at lower player counts).

I guess it's cool to see Star Wars franchise slapped on Carcassonne instead of Monopoly and the usual garbage. But how come the game is so ugly? A billion-dollar franchise should look better, really. The game play is fine; far from my favourite Carcassonne game, but not awful. The Force is not strong in this one, though, as the theme is really quite weak. Not a good Carcassonne, not a good Star Wars game...

Indifferent.

Played once.
Dice battles make this a bit different to standard Carcassonne.  Overthrows are random - no longer simply a matter of strength, but who then rolls the higher number.  As well, taking on a planet (=cloister) doesn't mean you keep it, since anyone adding a tile to its orbit may instead fight you for the planet!
That element of risk injects a bit of light-hearted fun into what is otherwise a fairly ploddy, thinky game.  And that seems to be pretty good!

The meanness diqualifies it as a great family game for me, and the luck factor makes it less fun to me to play with experienced gamers than normal Carcassonne.
If it didn’t have the Star Wars theme, I’d probably get rid of it. As it is, my family still asks for it every now and then (my son likes the theme, and my wife likes rolling some dice and the fact that this doesn’t have the fields) and I try not to be too mean when playing, so we still get some plays out of it.

RATING: 9
A fun and inventive version of the classic with dice rolling now deciding who wins a feature instead of who has the most followers, with matching Faction symbols helping out the battle. Cities and roads are reskinned as asteroid fields and trading routes while cloisters have become planets that can be invaded through the placement of adjacent tiles. Like Alderaan, farming has been totally obliterated.

RATING: 5
Carcassonne: Star Wars is about what you might expect. Farmers have been eliminated, which decreases the strategic depth. They've increased the prominence of monasteries, and added dice-based combat in them. Still didn't feel very Star Wars-y. So it's like Carcassonne, but not as good (and I don't really like Carcassonne anyway).

better than I thought it would be, it's still clearly carcassonne, but some interesting changes. No farmers for one. And if there's a conflict, you roll dice to see who stays on the board controlling the feature. The theme helped too, resulting in some SW table talk.

Way better than I was expecting. I enjoy this fast Carcassonne game. There is dice rolling so I was skeptic but I ended up having a lot of fun with it. I decided I will keep the copy I have. Just need Star Wars playing in the background to make it better!! I know a lot of people will not enjoy the dice rolling (which maybe why it is pretty low rated)- but for how fast the game is I think it adds some new interesting choices.

A solid Carcassonne variant brought me back to a game I'd not played physically for a long, long time. This was quick, fresh, pleasantly simple: everything I like about vanilla Carc. The planets do seem to be the obvious key to the game: I took a couple by force just as they scored and those points swung the game in my favour. Recommended as a 'themed gateway'. Get off my planet!

Confesso que temia que fosse pior, ainda assim, este é um Carcassonne fraco, fracote, fraquinho, que transforma um dos melhores "eurogames" em "ameritrash"! De positivo: com 3 a 5 jogadores já não há "panelinhas" de pontos, pois só um é que "mama", além disso, a arte até é engraçada, se bem que muito forçada no tema. De negativo: A insistência em fações sem se perceber muito bem porquê, pois até só há 3, ficando uma delas com um representante apenas; a ausência de qualquer pontuação do estilo "campos"; o abuso de planetas, sem grande  graça, etc...

RATING: 8
This is a interesting spin on carc.  They remove the farmer aspect of the game so there is no real long term goal but it really promotes conflict which is a fun new way to play.  Battles for planetary system are big in the game and does actually have a little thematic feel.  Not as good as the original but I do enojy this one for the pure tactics and the random battles if I'm looking for a light carc variant.

[HiG 2015 edition] {Star Wars; tile-laying, dice-rolling, partnership; optimal 4p} This is a fun game. I like it, especially when I am a Star Wars fan and Carcassonnne fan.

In essence, this is a Carcassonne game but it no longer has an option to lay on the space and have conflicts between players.  I particularly like the struggle of a planet.  The dice rolling adds so much fun to the game without being too luck driven.

The partnership mode is fun for me.

The components are nice, but I wish for more space ships, in addition to planets and asteroids.  But frankly, the theme is very thin and felt bolted on.

There's a little more luck I think in this than in Carcassonne proper, it's mitigated a bit by the fact that you get points when you lose, and get your meeple back.  Maybe after more plays, this is the point.  But the planet attacking can be a little swingy when you're talking about stealing 11 points someone was about to take and they get 2 because that's how many dice they rolled.

RATING: 6
More easy and more random variant of Carcassonne.

No pasture, so only 3 ways to score and without the most complex way. 

More random because of dice Rolls. Even if you have majority, you roll a dice (if you have majority you roll with more dices than your opponent).

Nice as a Carcassonne variant, but it fails as a Star Wars game. I don`t feel here this theme. No force. no light sword. You have the characters, but they have no special rules.

How can it get any better?  Carcassonne plus Star Wars.  The addition of battles gives this a nice twist from the original.  However, with that said, if you are just up for buying one Carcassonne game then I would still recommend the original, as it is a timeless gem of a game.

About [thing=180564][/thing], well... I ask myself why someone, at any point, when considering a new [thing=822][/thing] variant, thought: "You know what [thing=822][/thing] lacks? More conflict and randomness". Really? This is what could be considered a wanted change? Likely no, but this is what was done.

Not only there is the well known luck of the draw for the tiles, now they also come with symbols that can help you or your opponents to take what you used the tile for from you. And this dispute, if it happens, is decided by rolling dice and see who gets the higher number - therefore is possible to build something, only to be taken away. Yes, except planets (cloisters), a person can just go and try to take it - is need to first position a meeple in a way that, later, the person could be able to get together and battle for the trading routes (roads) and asteroids fields (cities). For the planets, though, is just put a tile adjancent to it and jump for battle. 

This means that a good chunk of the will of wanting to build something big, taking risks (with the tiles), is replaced by making the game even more immediatist than the normal game sometimes is, as it makes less risky to simply do small and opportunistic builds (like a two tiles asteroid field) - and this, for me, takes away a portion of the fun of the original game.

The rules also took out the farmers, which are one of the most strategic actions to use meeples.

In the end the only true positive thing I can say about this edition is that it is pretty. Other than this, [thing=180564][/thing] is a much inferior version of the original game and even more if compared with some of the other variant (like [thing=147303][/thing]). An edition only worth it for fans of the Star Wars movies. I don't recommend it.

I prefer regular Carc, but this is a nice variant.  I enjoy playing as a character more than I thought I would, and I'm looking forward to trying it out as team play.  My kids really enjoy the attacking dice rolls, especially when you can try and grab a planet.  All in all a nice addition to my collection, and I have to admit it is bit of a guilty pleasure playing a Star Wars themed Carc.

A very good add on the the Carcassonne Family.
In this opus, there are planets (Cathedrals) where you can put your troups on. Lot of planets, if if you don't put your troups on directly, you can place them later in the game by placing a road tile near the planet. More than that you can fight someone already on the planet ! Coool !
More luck with direct fighting on common places, but one you know it, you just have to deal with !
Maybe someone will creat a variant to reduce the dice-luck...

It's easy to laugh at this, but you know what it's not bad. With no "farmers" to worry about it's quick and easy to play, and the "combat" with dice added a nice bit of casual fun to an already casually fun game.

Rated right where a "solid 7" Euro should be.  And I'd play this over Star Wars Monopoly any day.  At heart it's still Carcassonne with castles replaced by asteroid fields and roads with trade routes.  The planets are a hybrid cloister where you can either conquer or attack an existing meeple with your own.  A dice-off determines the winner of the location.  I don't think the game needed any more luck but it is a nice twist and thematic with the title.

This also has become the 3000th game added to my collection.  Preserved for posterity.

I can't see why they say the rules have been simplified: they seem to me as simple as the usual carcassonne or slightly slightly more complicated (but of course still very very simple).
It feels very different, much more confrontational and luck dependant yet very satisfactory and fun. definitely yet another worth addition to the big family.
Played it 2 vs 2.

after playing it in just 2 players i lowered the vote a bit. it doesn't seem so tense as other Carc.s

A very different version. You can attack with dice! It takes a little while to get use to the slightly different fields of play but it is fun. If you love Carcassonne games, just buy this, you know you want to. :)

Nothing groundbreaking for people who have already played Carcassonne, though the theme makes it a better buy for Star Wars fans. The fact that you can "invade" someone's planet is a nice touch but since you can only win by rolling the dice, it's pure luck.

Fine Carcassonne variant that is objectively graphically not so inviting as the original (if one is not SW fan), but offers additional dice chucking moment.

Not as good as South Seas, but better than the original. The gameplay fits the theme reasonably well, lots of fighting for the planets (monasteries). It does add dice randomness to a game that didn't have it, so if that's the kind of thing that bothers you, be aware, although a lost fight is partly compensated.

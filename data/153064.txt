Actually, I'd rather play something else entirely, but if we're going to keep it in the cops and mobsters and pointing guns at each other genre...

Played it again this week and had a better experience the second time. I don't hate it as much as I did the first time.

RATING: 3
The deduction part with 3 cards is an interesting idea but it can run a bit long for a player elimination game (similar to Werewolf). Worse, it often descends into a random game of War with equipment cards which rather invalidates the deduction part. Not sure whether expansions alleviate or exacerbate the issue and don't really care to find out.

Interesting social deduction game. I like the fact that you do not have to lie in this game and you can investigate people and mix things up with the equipment cards. The way that people lie and make up illogical reasonings in other social deduction games like The Resistance or Avalon makes the game not fun for me.

1st plays: Played a couple of times in succession, I didn't like that when you want to do something you telegraph your moves a whole turn ahead.  It's basically Bang the dice game without the dice.  Not much deduction but probably fine with the kids.

Fluff card game played with 5. We *may* have killed only one Kingpin the first round (copy had an expansion that didn't indicate that it included a replacement card), but we took down the Agent in the second. This is a social deduction game, which is apparently not my favorite genre.

An awesome little social deduction game that plays quickly and does a great job for 4-8 in just 15-20 mins.  Loads of opportunity to lie or tell the truth and still have fun  

Each player has 3 face-down cards that determine your side (good or bad).  On your turn you can secretly investigate other players' cards trying to determine their allegiance, pick-up and aim a gun or shoot someone if you already had a gun aimed at them.  Adding to the flavour are numerous equipment cards that can change the flow of play dramatically.

Loads of laughs and groans, limited information and much bluffing.  A friendly, acessible party game that simply works.

I didn't much care for it.
There's two ways to play, both can be fun, but neither feel satisfying.
You can play serious deduction style or grab and shoot style.
The equipment cards have to much of a take-that feel to it which I don't care for and the player elimination feels just really harsh. I can see why people may like it, but it just isn't to my taste.

A great deduction game with a low component count that is surprisingly accessible.  Kind of a gateway deduction game.  I love how the mechanics play out in a thematic way--you have to reveal one of your three cards almost every time you take an action (your actions define who you are!).  Because table talk is encouraged but not required, I found this to be even easier to play than The Resistance. Some players just don't feel comfortable enough to really get into the game, and that's really OK in a game like Good Cop Bad Cop.  It does bear some superficial similarities to Bang (a game that I really do not like), but I like how this game works a lot more; it does become sort of a free-for-all once you know who others are, but it's WAY less random (you probably won't have a situation where a player is eliminated before that person has a chance to even take a turn). Over all, I love it and recommend it to just about anyone who enjoys games with a big social element. Acquired via Kickstarter.

Doesn't really work if someone goes rogue and shoots a gun for no reason (that person who thinks chaos makes every game more fun). With thinky players the end can drag a bit. Otherwise a solid game. Usually a good amount of laughter and playable with everyone from probably 8 years to closing on 80. 'Cause I've played with 7 and 8 yrs, and that extra year is the tiny bit more cognitive ability this game takes.

Social deduction games are not my forte but this one changes it up by having the loyalty cards that you can check and equipment cards to help you control what happens.  That said, this game is way short.  We played with 7 people and it got around the table twice before the agent was killed and the game was over in the same amount of time it took to explain the game.  Granted it was designed that way since you have to reveal cards to do special things, but just felt too fast and there was no discussion like what usually happens in social deduction games, and frankly, I missed that.

Good hidden role game that moves pretty quickly and encourages a lot of table talk.  Can be sucky if you are the Agent or Kingpin and are found out on another player's first turn...but that can be quickly turned with the right equipment cards!

Fun little deduction game where you try to deduct who is who. We had the impression that grabbing the gun from the middle is a bit too important, because of the ability to shoot, but there are certainly ways to migitate that. Equipments work really well, and the fact that you have to reveal something yourself to get something significant done is well done.

RATING: 6
Fun but felt a bit fiddly at times and annoying.  More chaotic than Blood Bound but also a more wonky structure.  Ultimately I think I would rather be playing Blood Bound because of how much smoother it is, but both games don't quite measure up to Resistance: Avalon or One Night Ultimate Werewolf, which are both simply more engaging and feel less mechanical.

=====Tentative Rating====

I've only had a couple of plays of this so far and I'm not really sure how I feel about it yet. The 3-loyalty card system sounded great on paper, but my games so far all followed a pretty similar script: the first few rounds see all players silently investigating each other, then when the first person of the opposite team discovers the Kingpin or Agent they start actively targeting that person and everyone else follows suit. And by then pretty much everyone knows who everyone is.

It's sort of like Bang!, but without the nebulous renegade/deputy dichotomy to add that little extra bit of uncertainty. There's just so much opportunity for information I'm not sure where the bluffing even comes in - the game says you can make claims about your loyalty cards but I'm not sure why you ever would; confusing your own teammates seems like it would just do more harm than good in almost any situation.

I would play this again if offered, and I really want to get a few more plays in to figure out if that script can be broken or if it's fairly inevitable. But because there's no real cost to investigating someone and a VERY high cost to shooting someone on your team it seems like the game encourages the pattern we adhered to.

Honestly the whole game sort of reminds me of a worse version of The Castle of the Devil. In that game you attack people to gain information, but you (a) have more than one target so you can't just luck into finding your sole target, (b) winning a fight is basically always a good thing, and crucially (c) the downside to losing a fight isn't that bad. [i]And[/i] all the while you need to be trading items with everyone at the table so the entire game has a much more dynamic feel.

I'll be interested to try the expansion as early reports suggest it might just add the extra spice I'm looking for, but as-is I'm feeling pretty cold toward it.

Still trying to get a feel for this game. So far, it hasn't been super fun. It seems like the best way to enjoy this game is to go all in on the cards and act erratically. It never really worked out in my group as a sit and think and analyze each other type of social deduction game. It was a lot of energy, noise, and randomness...although I think most really great social deduction games end up being loud and passionate.

Great light-hearted game that is just a barrel of laughs.  Due to the way the roles are dealt out (completely random), we saw so many different variations on the make-up of the table.  On the very first round we played, EVERYONE was a crooked cop except, of course, the Agent.  The objects throw wonderful wrenches in the whole thing, too.  One round, a player and I both looked at the same card and discovered the agent; I was totally crooked, yet she was totally honest.  However, I played the Plant Evidence object which switched her allegiance and she quickly armed herself to shoot the Agent.... except someone else played the card that switches cards between players and suddenly she was honest again.  Total blast and lots of opportunities for fun.  Even if you lose, it's not that big a deal as you just run it again since it's so short.  Nice game in a small package.

It's pretty generic social deduction.  The issue I found was that the "good" and "bad" sides are arbitrary- both sides are completely equal.  But despite this, there's still a strong bias towards the "bad" side, so everyone will always pretend to be good even when it's not to the team's advantage.

RATING: 5
This is a hidden role game whereby you have 3 role cards. The majority of them dictates your alliance, so 2 Honest and 1 Crooked makes you an Honest cop or vice versa. Then one player will have the Agent or Kingpin card among their cards and this trumps and makes them the leader of the good guys or bad guys. The point of the game is to suss out the enemy leader and -- via actions over multiple turns -- take a gun, aim, and fire. Regular guys take one shot to die but the Agent/Kingpin need 2 to kill.

The downside is that you are forced to flip over your cards as the game progresses so the mystery doesn't last long. Then it comes down to who can kill the other enemy leader first, and from our plays, the answer to that question was determined by the luck of the equipment cards. You get equipment cards that do crazy things like steal a gun, go twice in a row, reverse turn order, etc. You might have things set up in your favor but if my teammate can steal your gun and go twice in a row, well... whatcha gonna do?

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
As far as party games go, I believe this to be one of the better ones.  It is very unlikely to be knocked out before your turn and you get to make decisions which matter.

The best end-game scenario we had involved one of our group deciding deciding who to side with was too stressful and deflected a bullet into himself so he wouldn't have to decide.  Pure genius!

The paranoia of who can trust who ends up in some interesting end game situations.

Really neat social deduction game in the same vein of the resistance. It has the potential for some unbalanced games due to the way the role system works (3 cards each) but for the most part it's good fun. Bombers and Traitors adds a bit too, but in the times I've played it no one has ever been one.

I finally got a chance to play this, and overall it's good. It plays very fast and it's interesting how the dynamics of the game can be very different just by the order in which players act. However, I would say I prefer Secret Hitler (as yet unreleased, but you can play it on Table Top Simulator), although that game takes significantly longer to play. I didn't feel as if Good Cop Bad Cop was as "tight" as some other games like this, but it's still a good game and worth playing and owning.

RATING: 7
This is a good social party game.  It is one of the few games that plays 8 players without a hitch.  There is some great subtle tactics that can be employed that players will realize over a few plays.

The equipment cards really add spice to what would otherwise be a decent deduction game.  However, equipment cards are somewhat a negative as they can swing the game very quickly and for no reason (for example someone swapping the Kingpin and Agent cards which completely flip flops the teams).  However, ever, that negative is a positive as it leads to crazy swings and emotional highs.  

I would definitely recommend this as a warm up game for game night.

I would steer away from it for casual get-togethers with non-gamers.  It is too easy for this game to turn into a "I'm just going to shoot you because..." which can kick a player out early for no reason other than a chuckle.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Played this a bunch but haven't pulled the trigger on a buy. Love hidden role and mild deduction and based on our gaming library this should be right up our alley. I guess my main issue with the game is you can play perfectly but someone can switch your team out of spite and cause you to lose at the end. Also the deduction aspect is weak as once enough cards are revealed you can easily figure out who is who and then it becomes the luck of the Equiptment Cards ( which are super neat and i do like). Very possible this scales up much better than the 5-6 i'v played it at, and won't rule out buying due to it being so cheap.

I only played this one night(about 4-5 games) so I don't know how it holds up long term, but it was extremely fun.

A solid addition to the hidden role genre. The use of multiple cards to define your role allows other players to gain actual information on your team without being certain until the end. The equipment cards bring an element of luck to keep the endgame from being a foregone conclusion. 

Later: Would play again, but no longer as much of a fan. The game has two distinct phases. The first part has players randomly checking for team affiliation, the second has them all establishing who is on which team and then throwing equipment cards at each other. The identity determining part is too definite, because looking at someone's cards will eventually give you an absolute knowledge of their identity. The second phase is too chaotic and determined mainly by the luck of who draws which equipment card. If someone has a gun, they'll be hit with alignment switching cards over and over or just have the gun taken away. In both phases the game is just too much determined by game mechanics instead of the social instincts of the player.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (October 2014)

Reminiscent of Blood Bound. After a regular first game, I have come to enjoy Good Cop Bad Cop. You can explain it under 3 minutes and the playtime is around the 15 minute mark, many times is less than that. 

The art is kind of regular but the game itself offers lots of fun. The theme don’t do anything for me.

It’s great that you affiliation is decided by 3 cards, I have only seen this mechanism in the 3 player variant of Die Kutschfahrt zur Teufelsburg (a game I really like). I also like that you have to show an integrity card to get an equipment or to pick up a gun, this makes the game very dynamic and short.

Love the tension when a player points the gun at you or at your leader, it is also great that some equipment cards allow exchanging integrity cards, it makes for great and surprising game endings. The equipment cards are very random (and unbalanced?) but I don’t mind as the game is so short. 

The rules on the publisher website didn’t work for me but they said they will look into this.

Bottom line, I like the game. Hidden identity is perhaps my favorite game mechanic so I expect to play Good Cop Bad Cop a lot in the near future. For now I’m keeping my copy of the game and I will probably buy the coming expansion. Perhaps it will rise in my personal ratings. 

Current Rating: 6.0

After more plays I now see the rating won’t ever surpass the 6.0 mark. I enjoy the game but I don’t want to play it often. 

The new edition has better components, but it also is more expensive and comes with a bigger box. I’m not sure it is worth it and I will keep my old and small edition.

I printed this game as a print and play and enjoyed it so much I bought a copy. This game can be taught to anyone very quickly and almost any age. My eight year old played this with the rest of my kids no problem. This is just a fun fun party game and is a favourite with my in laws. 
The nice thing about this game is that half the table will win instead of just one. There can be a lot of twists that create a fun situation. And it plays quick enough for you to have several games in one sitting. It's hard to play this game just once.

2015-05-20 - This is an interesting team based, hidden role game. It feels a little like a simplified Blood Bound. It's definitely easier to teach than Blood Bound. The rules are a little vague, though, with regards to how some equipment works, and you'll probably end up making some calls in-game.

Good Cop Bad Cop offers a quick, satisfying group deduction experience. I like the fact that no one knows who is on their team from the outset. This information must be discerned as players investigate, share, and mislead others. It's a nice fit for the 5-7 player count niche.

RATING: 7
A tiny, cool deduction game where players are all either good cops or bad/dirty cops.  You are dealt 3 cards and if you have at least two good cop cards, you are good, if you have at least two bad cop cards, you are bad.  The exception is if you get the Agent card or the Kingpin card.  They are the leaders of the good cops and bad cops, respectively.  If you have one of those cards, the other cards you have are irrelevant and those special cards decide your allegiance.  You then play to try to learn who is on your team and who isn't.  There are gun cards to use to shoot others and gear cards with wild gadgets with wacky powers.  The game is quite fun.  Anything with social deduction involved gets my interest.

Granted I'm not a fan of social deduction games, but to me this one seems particularly vanilla, as while it doesn't have the bluffing aspects of Coup and The Resistance that I find stressful, it doesn't have the cool powers that can change up the game that say Coup or Love Letter has. While there are cards with powers the wide range of what they can do and the fact you can only hold one at the time makes it feel less strategic when you use them. Also can have issues of the sides not being balanced.

This game is perfect for when you need a quick heavy game breather or when you're a few drinks in. Or when you just want to shoot someone. It's probably the lightest of the social deduction games that is in my top 100, just because, while that is an element, you can play/win without spending much time/effort figuring out the identities of everyone else because you can investigate and know for sure.

Social deduction game which works best with at least 6 players. If you aren't good at deception you can just let the cards speak for you.

A game like Bang - but more streamlined and more fun.  The bad cops are trying to kill the Agent and the good cops are trying to kill the Kingping.  Since investigations reveal actual information on the player identities, reading players (as in Resistance or Werewolf) does not dominate the gameplay but it still has it's place.  There's a surprising depth to the tactical choices that emerge from the table dynamics.  Overall, this is a very fun, short, chaotic, social game.

Falls more each time I play it.  I don't know what it is about this game but like it a little less each time.  To easy to eliminate others and once you find the Agent or Kingpin, game is pretty much over.  Had high hopes but sadly did live up to the fun.

RATING: 7
A really quick and dirty deduction game. It's not one I could see myself playing back to back multiple times in a row, but for what it is, I enjoy this game quite a bit. I could make some minor complaints about how they cut costs in production and how equipment cards can sometimes not be that useful, but the good far outweighs the bad. This sort of feels like Bang! done correctly for me. It doesn't last longer than 10 minutes either, so this makes for an awesome filler.

Fun game that I think will eventually fire The Resistance in my collection.  I like that you don't have to lie and bluff (that much), which makes The Resistance really hard for some players.

I also own the Bombers and Traitors expansion.

EDIT: Fun game, but it just can't beat out One Night Ultimate Werewolf for my group.  I gave it away to my brother!

The components and art are average. The rules are pretty simple and it’s very easy to teach, even for non-gamers. The theme is a bit forced on; it just feels as a team battle game.

It fell quite flat on me. After seeing the first card of a player, if it is the opposite of yours people tend to fire the gun, because he was likely to be your enemy. This tactic worked on most of the cases; it is mathematically sound and keep investigating until you have perfect information might take ages. Being shot and forced off the game at turn 2 is no fun.

Nobody cared to use the items, it seemed like a big waste of time. But from what I’ve seen, they are really random. Some are really powerful, some other are useless.

I have the impression we have missed something about this game, because it really seemed to be a terribly insipid game. I’m trying to play it again with some different people to see what I might have missed. But until someone proves me wrong, I must call this a bad design. There are certainly much better hidden roles games around.

RATING: 7.5
A great "who's on the other team?" deduction game.  Does suffer somewhat because of quick (often arbitrary) player elimination, but it is often over so fast it doesn't matter (and allows the unfairly slain to plot their revenge).  
We played it three or four times in a row, which is usually a pretty good sign that it has been a success.
I like it.  
The price is ridiculous for the components, however.  $15 for a deck of flimsy (really flimsy) cards that pretty much demand sleeves is too high.  Games like Straw have higher quality stock, just as much game development (if not more), and sells for 2/3rds of the price.  I understand the dev's "gotta get theirs", but it feels a little mercenary.
That said, still bought it at MSRP and feel basically like I got most of my money's worth.

I have heard this game compared to Bang, and while I don't necessarily disagree, for a lot of people like me that is a big turn off. Good Cop Bad Cop is much more streamlined and focused on investigating loyalty. It naturally encourages players to bluff and be social instead of jumping right into firing their guns. It was a surprise success with my group. The only complaint I have is that the ending can fall a bit flat depending on the position of the guns and pure dumb luck of investigation.

RATING: 2
Very poorly designed game that clearly was either not play-tested well or did not care about game balance or interesting decisions.

Equipment cards are too often too powerful, useless, and their random assignment makes the game too random. Equipment that makes players change teams should definitely not be in the game

Additionally, the random assignment of team ratios makes the game experience feel extremely arbitrary. 

Ultimately too much of the game feels decided by the starting team ratios and who can draw the better equipment cards.

I can only see people enjoying this game if they like the "oh let's just do this and see what happens later" kind of gameplay, do not care at all about game balance, are ok with making arbitrary decisions and like extreme randomness

Only the artwork is ok

This is a really fun game, but I feel like there is some luck involved vs strategy to actually ensure you win. The order of turns can completely defeat your purpose, halting your victory until it's too late. With games like this, if you determine who the good cops and bad cops are, I feel like you deserve to win. But there are mechanics that stop that from happening either way, but it's still a blast! It reminds me of a smaller Werewolf that can be played in a shorter time.

It's 'social deduction', so I should stop right there. But I can sum it up pretty well: 1. Let me look at your card. Are you the kingpin/agent? If yes, "Hey, everyone! That's the kingpin/agent!" If no, keep your mouth shut. 2. Grab a gun and shoot or don't shoot. I do not get the point of these games.

This game has surprised me quite a bit.  There's not really anything new here, just another spin on the 15 minute social deduction genre, but it just works well.  There's not as much stress of having to perfectly bluff an action like in Coup, there's very little control in how things turn out, it's all in the fun of hunting down your friends identities and pointing guns at them.

I will say the big downside is in the random distribution of cards, and the requirement of rambunctious (drunk) players.  You can get some bunk card distributions where it ends up with 5 players against 1, which ends very quickly and fizzles.  Some people just don't get into the fun of it, which those people need to lighten up.

Edit: More and more I seem to be breaking this game out and people just aren't having fun with it, I honestly don't understand why.  I think people just expect more strategy and get frustrated at the chaotic nature of it, for a 10 minute game, I think it's a blast personally, but having everyone up in arms and huffing and puffing every game has been killing the fun for me.

Yet another hidden role/find the traitor game. It's a solid entry, but nothing game changing. I will say I like how the roles are assigned. You are dealt three cards that come in two different suits. Which ever suit you have the majority of assigns you the role. Elegant and interesting. Especially since the three cards are used throughout the game as resources to slowly reveal your true allegiance.

Game play is almost too simplistic to be interesting, but the equipment deck throws in just enough chaos to keep everyone guessing until the end. My gut tells me this doesn't have a lot of legs, but if you find yourself with an opportunity to play, take it for a spin. It's a good time for what it is.

A game that's bad from any angle.  The cons and cons:

If you play with 4 players, there's barely any deduction and the agent/kingpin is dead in 4-6 minutes.  That's 4-6 minutes you could have spent committing seppuku or watching your grandparents have sex.  Or both.

If you play with 6+ players, you're playing the game as intended, and the game as intended isn't very good AND it's longer.

Pro tip: use the foam guns from Cash 'n Guns in stead of the gun cards that come with the game.

Good, but does not discourage players to hoard guns from the get go.

My favorite social deduction game by far...

- No player elimination
- Fast
- Easy to learn
- You dont need to be a good bluffer (no poker face needed)

It delivers the same feeling like avalon, but the teamwork here shines a little bit more because of the mechanics.

The game does not scale well as it needs more players and an even number of players. A substantial amount of luck may lead to one side outnumbered by the other and therefore have the odds stacked against it. The early part of the game is spent figuring out who are the good and bad cops and is mildly interesting. After that, it is just down to manipulation of the special equipment to take each other out.

Quick social deduction style game. Seems to go by too fast without having to make many choices. Need to play more, but doesn't provide the laughs of ONUW or the story/strategy of Dark Moon.

A tad weak for the genre, especially with odd # of players.

It's funny how nce you shoot a gun, you drop it. Or you can blackmail a bad cop into a good cop.

The game strikes a good balance between being casual and yet being actually a hidden-role game, and my playgroup loved it and played 9-16 games (lost count), and I'll be bringing it every time.

The only downsides are that the box isn't compartmental, and the theme choice is rather unfortunate and unnecessary; it may be a barrier to introducing it to playgroups such as ones with children or a Bible study.

PROS
- Deduction and bluffing plays a lot into the game to make it fun
- Different roles and special powers for each role adds variety and strategy 
- Deduce what is being done and what is not being done while trying to figure out who's who on your team 
- Can play up to a number of players pretty well
- Plays rather quick 

CONS
- Inquisitor is kind of hard to grasp at first and must be played whenever there is an odd number
- Best between 6-10 players
- Hard to grasp at first, but easier as things move along
- Of course, the terrible artwork but that's obvious
- Some small cards to keep track of and rules switches considering what roles are involved

Shadow Hunters w/ a splash of Coup. More deduction than the bluff fest of Coup. It can become scripted in the last 5 minutes, more so w/ experienced players. But the game is so fast, this hardly matters . . . and getting there is fun anyway.  Coups fun comes from the excitement and tension of the guess, and I understand that, but it's kind of random player elimination for most of the game. Blood Bound is much more about detective work and a better "game" experience.

RATING: 7
Based on 3 games. this is a clever hidden team game that just moves right along. Some deduction, and a misguess/bad deduction can end it, but it takes ~20 minutes with 6 players.

Has some interesting mechanisms for a deduction game, however it seems like the end always gets in a situation where it just ends up being a race once all peoples factions are revealed.

RATING: N/A
In my opinion, one of the few misfires of the Kennerspiel nominees/suggestions. There's an interesting idea kicking around, trying to kill the enemy leader before yours. In practice, the game is very uninvolving for those not under scrutiny. If you are wounded early in the game, you're ignored for the remainder of the game. If you aren't wounded until late, you just sit around and wait for your turn to go. By the time a team is ready for the kill, it becomes an exercise in painfully obvious tactics. Just not a great social deduction game.

RATING: 8.5
It's criminal that people might avoid this game because of the art. It's an excellent hidden role game and it's pretty accessible for new gamers because you can find out factual information on people's identities. 

Starts out with a bit of a psychological game, playing hidden roles, but then the end game is like playing a puzzle game, using player powers to maximize efficiency to win in less moves than the other team. The end game is very cool, but many people don't expect a puzzle like that in a hidden role game. Some may not like that, but I love it.

Two clans... *cough*... Tribes of vampires will hunt each other down and destroy the leader of the opposition. If they can remember who is on their side quickly enough. 

Plays a bit like the resistance, but on an equal footing for both sides, a third faction, and a lot of speed. 

I really recommend at least 8 players though. It plays with 6 and 7, but it's a bit too easy to guess who everyone is.

Your first few play may take a while to get but after a few palys it is a fun group game.  Not great for new gamers as it is a bit confusing.

Why I got rid of it : With time I felt this game required too much training to play and other games give me this feel while being shorter and easier to teach.

I like the dagger-passing, and that some reliable information enters the system as the game goes on.

It seems like you can easily reach a point mid-game where one team has something of a lock on the victory, though; this happened in both of our games. (We were playing with 6 - the minimum complement - not sure if that's involved.)

A nice but unspectacular party game. Of course, there's always something to be said for a 20-minute game that handles 12 players and doesn't suck.

Had one game where I pulled off a really cool move to win. The fact that the game allows for that sort of thing definitely improved my opinion of it.

I don't know who originally said "this game looks like a Hot Topic threw up on it," but that is a perfect description. The graphic design is SO Hot Topic-y that it's fun!

Something of a cross between “Coup” and “The Resistance” with a little bit of “Samurai Swords/Bang” thrown in, this is a great bluffing and deduction filler game that plays between 15 minutes to a half hour MAX depending on the number of players (up to 12!) but its horrendous (and cheap looking) artwork on top of a theme with a very narrow audience appeal keeps this game from ever hitting the table.  

I don’t understand why people like to harp on “Love Letter” for its various reincarnated themes; honestly – if a game has solid mechanics, I don’t see any reason for it not to be re-themed and offered in other versions to achieve wider audience appeal.  If there was any game that needed a re-theming and a complete artwork overhaul, its “Blood Bound.”  In its current incarnation, I can only see it geared toward the goth/vampire obsessed sub-culture.  

A gamer brought this to a meet once several years ago and I remember everyone enjoying it, but I have never EVER seen it brought to any meetup anywhere since and seems to have now been wiped from everyone’s memory.  Which is a shame because the mechanics are very good.  Honestly, it really is an ugly looking fun game especially if you like “Coup”, “The Resistance” or “Samurai Swords/Bang”.  I love how this is a player elimination game and yet avoids any player elimination!

This game feels too deterministic. There comes a point when everybody knows who is on which side, and you can figure out which team will likely win many turns in advance. If I play, it needs to be with odd numbers so you can have an Inquisitor - this might make it less deterministic.

My friends love playing this game, but I don't.

The problem is, that at the begging of the game everything is so random that by the time everyone has any clue of what is going on, it is already late and who will be the winning team is pretty obvious, and then after a point it is really hard to turn the game around.

The inquisitor is a horrible character, who has a very limited window of game play, and once people figure out if you are the inquisitor then you just sit and wait. Same thing happens to most of the players, figure you out too soon? Well you have to spend the next 20 minutes doing nothing. 

This game has nothing to do with deductions, and relies too much on chance. Especially at the first few rounds.

Blood Bound is an interesting game that combines social and logical deduction.
Early on, the only information characters have is their own role and the (likely) allegiance of a neighbor. Only through random attacks do the identities of other people slowly become revealed. The deduction is not entirely logical, however, as some roles never explicitly reveal their allegiance.
Knowing how and when to intervene for other players or when to reveal yourself in general varies depending on your role and the knowledge you posses. When someone does offer to intervene on your behalf, you also must wonder whether or not they seek to help or sabotage you.
Blood Bound has just enough decision-making to be interesting but not overwhelming. It's also extremely quick so losses are rarely salty.

I really like hidden role games, so it's not surprising that I enjoy Blood Bound from time to time. Even though I would be happy to play it though, it really doesn't hold a candle to games like The Resistance. 

It is perhaps closest to something like One Night Werewolf, since each player has a specific special power. While those are intriguing, they also really raise the barrier to entry. A new player can make a very poor decision on the first turn that essentially tanks it for his entire team. 

It is not really a particularly intuitive system, but players really do not have the option to ask questions mid-game for fear of spoiling something. This can lead to overly long upfront rules explanations. I recognize that these can be considered minor complaints, especially once everyone playing really understands the game, but there are a lot of options in this same genre that don't seem to suffer from those problems. I would generally choose to just play one of those games instead.

A game of deception and probably in the Resistance universe!

Players secretly dealt a card blue or red and characters range from 1-9. Each card carries an ability and players may intercept other players from attacking their ally??? Use special powers to defend/attack others but use them wisely as you may only use your power once and once you reveal your identity you may give yourself away to the opposing team.

The goal of the game is to kill the player of the opposing team with the lowest number but that could also be reversed with some special skills :)

Initial Rating: 6.5 (February 2014)

My favorite mechanic in games is Hidden Roles, so I thought I would love this game. I liked it, and I think it can go up higher in my personal ratings. I have only played it twice, but there were some misunderstanding from some players, so the game wasn’t as fun as it can be (I think). This led me to think that the game is highly dependent on the game group. 

It is easy to teach and learn, and it plays quickly. The art is good (a la Flying Frog), I know it bothers some people, but I like it. The game components are great, the only downside for me are the weird card size making it hard to transport (I still haven’t found a deck box for the game). The dagger is neat, but also hard to transport. I’m a little worried that once you get to a certain point in the game, the outcome is very clear, but we still need to “finish the turns”, still as it play fast I’m not bothered (much) by this. Love the special powers. The game makes little thematic sense, but I don’t care much about that in these kind of games. 

For now, The Resistance is still king for me, but I want to play more Blood Bound. I will carry it with me to each of our gaming sessions and I will update my comment soon.

I actually like deduction games (unlike alot of my gaming group) but this has so little information and table chatter is useless in the early stages of the game.  It's random enough that I feel that I have more control in Shadow Hunters.  It's a waste of time that could go to much better deduction games that play in the same short time frame like Coup.


And the art is truly horrific LARPing at it's worst.

An interesting game that has been completely ruined by its theme and artwork. I like how quickly the game plays, and these hidden team games are fun. You have to separate them mentally from traitor games, since I'm not sure it's too helpful to completely mislead everyone at the table. But it seems like there's room for clever play and enough unknowns that it is not solvable, or wouldn't be dominated too much but those that like to tell others what to do.

That said, the theme and artwork is horrendous and makes me not want to play the game at all. It is childish, ugly, unimaginative and unfortunately, damning evidence of who we are as board game players that companies think that this is what we want. Even though the idea for the game is good, I would never recommend this game to anyone and would think twice about playing it with people I don't know well enough to explain my reservations.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Team deduction game in some ways similar in concept to Resistance, etc.  There are two teams and possibly one inquisitor who is on his own and can win by prediction.  Special powers exist for each character which can be used once.  

Plays up to 12 so this is an excellent large group game.  I was less than impressed with the art and theme.  Think Twilight...blech!

Played it in Essen, bought it in Essen, think it is great. I love it because it is a short game, it only took 20 - 30 minutes and it is better than Werwolf cause nobody is kicked out after 10 minutes and then have to stand at the sideline and watch the others play for the next 2 hours.

Very entertaining and fun party game of team and rank deduction. Similar to The Resistance in style in terms of teams and hidden identity, Blood Bound differs in mechanics and gameplay. There is plenty of hidden identity and deduction that needs to be discovered by each teams and is a great deal of fun.

Yes, the game looks terrible.  I mean really, almost embarrassingly terrible.  However, put the appearance aside and you find an excellent team vs team deduction/bluffing game rivaling the best ones of this kind.  In spite of the many pieces and the FFG rules, the game is actually easy to teach/learn/play and the gameplay is smooth.  I am especially fond of the team vs team aspect and the interaction/cooperation/trust needed within the team to win (without knowing for sure who is on your team).  A very pleasant surprise, I suspect this game would be more popular if it weren't for  the embarrassing/misleading appearance.

[b]This game gives you more information to base your decisions on than, say, Werevolves, so this might be for you if Werewolves is too random for you, or too much "social" and not enough "deduction". It's also a lot fiddlier and harder to explain to new players/non-gamers.
I don't enjoy the aggressive "why did you do x, it was obvious that y, now you've made us lose" atmosphere this tends to create with some of the people I play this with. Not everyone is equally good at deduction, and Blood Bound seems to draw a lot of attention to that fact.[/b]

RATING: 7
A surprise hit for me.  While not nearly as in-depth as Resistance, it does an amazing job handling a large amount of players.  Players do need to be vocal to participant though otherwise they are "out" of the game.

However, it is one of the few social deduction game that isn't reliant on "I'm innocent" like Werewolf or Resistance.

Played an early prototype and had a blast. At least with an even number of players (I did not try it in an uneven group), this is possibly the best deduction and negotiation game I played up to this day (for me it was better than The Resistance – and I really like The Resistance – as Blood Bound plays much shorter and is much easier to grasp, plus it gives you possibly more incentive for trash talk and misleading other players). The rule explanation is a bit longer than for The Resistance, though.

I really like this take on the Werewolf formula. Unlike Werewolf, this game sets up really fast. The mechanics are just as easy to teach but the special powers make it much more tactical.

Really fun game, and works best with larger groups. Smaller groups definitely aren't as pleasant, which limits when you can get the game out. On top of that, you have to teach the rules to people when you're working with alot of people. 

The uniqueness of the gameplay (race to piece together a puzzle and take out the other team's leader first; working with your team and abilities)... Can be abstract enough for new comers... But the actual game's fun comes from trying to figure out with others... how can you make the most of what you have!

RATING: 7.1
Unlike other hidden roles, I really like that no one knows their team ('cept Inquisitor) until the game progresses. Its quite different. The dagger as current turn player is an interesting concept and an awesome freeform choice rather than the plain "clockwise" turn order thing. I also love that you don't need to close your eyes and hold them for long periods of time, unlike in Avalon and ONUWW, which is a minor nitpick I have in those games.

I also feel that everyone has chances to shine with their ability and proper play, especially across several plays since this game goes so quickly (20 minutes on average).

I'll be honest - I think the first time I played this compared to the Resistance, I was more addicted to this game. I didn't initially know for sure which I liked more, but over time, I've definitely come to like BB more. (for more info, check my Comparison Review on the Blood Bound page at https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1259268/quick-comparison-blood-bound-resistance)

The time consistency of this game is also great - it never reaches an hour+ and barely reaches 30 minutes, and its consistently around 15-20 range. As players get wounds, the end of the game approaches at a fairly constant rate. (The only way to stall that is to hold the dagger really long or stall out, but that's not gonna win the player the game)

Amazing game, strongly worth a try if you like hidden roles and deterministic games. One small caveat - you need 6P-12P to play this. You could try with 4P or 5P in theory I think, but I'm not sure how it'd play. It played phenomenally at the player counts I was in though (I think it was 10P, 7P, and 8P or so)

EDIT: Having played this and Resistance a bit more, I think I definitely do like this more than base Resistance. Its shorter yet more consistent time wise, it feels like you have slightly more control over your destiny in my opinion, the stabs are more fun than voting on teams, you don't have to close your eyes, and you have NO ONE to trust in the beginning and dont even know your own teammates (you can't even trust the person on your right who shows you his symbol since he could be a Harlequin/Inquisitor in an odd game). The only flaw in my opinion is that it takes a little while longer to explain than the Resistance and is harder to pick up (they probably should've put an explanation of the abilities onto the cards themselves). Also, another possible issue is that the end can be calculated midway through, so there's no sense of climax. I don't mind that since it plays fast though and that usually occurs toward the end anyway.

The art work and required player counts hurt BB though. Theme-wise, I'm not crazy about it, but its not bad, this vampire game.

Plays: 4+

Debating trading but I figure I can ONUW for 3-7/8 and BB for 7-11/12 for good player count coverage.

One of the better werewolf style games.  The powers are interesting, and the game is filled with tension.

Still, with the right group of gamers, can be a great time.

Something just seemed off about this one. The actions don't really make any thematic sense. Sometimes stabbing someone who you now is your teammate can lead to victory because of the way abilities interact. I never win because I feel like we made a clever play and it seems like there's not enough time in the game to allow any sort of real deduction skills. Simple to the point of frustration.

I read a review of this game in Spielbox and they made it sound very clever and fun.  I typically don't like hidden role games but this sounded like it might be the exception.

The game is played with two teams of players in equal numbers.  Each team is made up of a random selection of 9 possible roles.  The goal of each team is to assassinate the leader of the opposing team.  Once someone is assassinated the game is over and if you assassinated anyone else but the opposing team's leader then the opposing team wins.

You start the game by revealing your team affiliation to the player to your left so they most likely know which team you are on.  However, one of the roles shows the opposite team affiliation.  From then each turn one player has a little cardboard dagger and they point it at the player they are attacking.  Other players can offer and the attacked player can request another player to intervene.  If this agreement is made then the intervening player is the target of the attack instead.  Whoever receives the attack takes a token to mark that they've been wounded.  This can either be one of two affiliation tokens matching their role (which are sometimes question marks still hiding the team they belong to) or a number token denoting their rank within their team (once you select your rank you activate your role's special ability but can also no longer intervene).  Then the wounded player is the new holder of the dagger and chooses a new target.  This continues until a player receives their 4th wound which kills them and ends the game.

All of this sounded very intriguing to me but after playing I discovered that in order for this game to really work you need dishonest, clever, scheming people.  In our first game everyone pretty much told the truth about who they were and everyone else pretty much trusted everything that was said.  In this way we got into a situation where the winner was pretty much determined for the last 3 rounds of the game.  If there was lying and distrust then the game would have been a lot less deterministic and a lot more fun I believe.  Also, it is imperative to play with as many players as possible (up to 12) because with fewer player counts the game is a lot less interesting.

I would also love to play with an odd number of players soon.  With an odd number one player takes on the unaffiliated role of the Inquisitor.  The inquisitor still shows the symbol of one of the two teams and also can place any token he wishes in front of himself when wounded (except rank which he must select inquisitor).  This can throw a pretty big wrench into the works and incite some delightful chaos.

Second play of this game we had a much better time.  There was more deception, distrust, and untrustworthiness which made the game less of a forgone conclusion and made players get into it and there were smiles and excitement all around.  Party/social games like this certainly need to be played with the right group but when they are offer a lot of enjoyment outside of the game itself, really.  They act as more of a catalyst for that fun.  Also, the inquisitor does improve the forumla a lot in my opinion, I prefer this game with an odd number of players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
We might have a winner! I really enjoy 'werewolf'-type games, "The Resistance" being my favorite in this genre for a while now but "Blood Bound" might beat it by a smidgen. Here you are member of one of the opposing vampire clans, not only do you need to find out who your friends and foes are but who the elder, the leader is since to win you need to kill the other team's elder vampire, if you kill the wrong vampire, you lose. And in games with uneven players, there is a sort of neutral inquisitor added who is out for his very own winning chance. 
I think it adds another layer by not only figuring out who is on which side but what rank everyone holds. There is more interaction, more ways to give and gather hints to someone's identity than in other games of this style and everyone has to take part. To be sure if BB really is the best game this style for me, I probably should play it back to back with Resistance but for now it will hold that stand.
Update: the rules to this game can be confusing, especially if you haven't played in a while. I might be losing some interest in social deduction games but I am not sure this holds up so well, I still enjoy it quite a bit but my initial uber-excitement has waned a bit.

Takes the hidden teams idea from Shadow Hunters and makes it less random.  In the beginning you have no idea what you’re doing. At the end it is really easy to see exactly how the last few turns will play out. There is a tiny window in the middle where the real deduction happens and if that window were bigger this game would be awesome.

RATING: 6
Was really tired when I played this and whilst I found it entertaining I don't think there's much of a game here. Just attack the other team based on the fairly obvious reveal tokens until the puzzle is solvable and then declare the winner. Judicious use of special abilities is useful but doesn't seem to have a huge impact on the outcome. It may in some games but in others it makes little difference.

The much maligned art serves to make the game more entertaining than less so I think in that regard it's a good thing and I did enjoy playing it and would play it again.

*On the subject of art I previously thought I wanted "good art" (wide appeal, colorful and polished presentation) in games but a string of games have changed my opinion.  Now I'd much rather have interesting art Ascension, St Petersburg, Blood Bound or Bus rather than the slick but lifeless art in Star Realms, Mage Wars and Descent.

Fun game that I would compare more to Good Cop Bad Cop than The Resistance. The Resistance is all about watching how people vote and making choices based on players' actions, but GCBC and Blood Bound are more about tactical moves and have a little more chaos going on because of the various equipment (GCBC) and abilities (Blood Bound).

A lot has been said about the "vampire cosplay" look of the game. Yes, it is really bad. But as with most games, my group quickly ignored the art and just focused on the gameplay. So the art really isn't an issue during gameplay, it's just a deterrent to any potential buyers, which is a shame. It is baffling that FFG, known for their incredible evocative artwork, decided not to make this game look better.

Still, this is a good game and should probably be a bigger player in the current social deduction boom, but the art direction of the game is holding it back.

[b]Player Count Verdict: 8[/b]
I like this with exactly 8. I've only played once with an odd number, but I didn't like how the dynamic changes. Adding the neutral role to the game really changes things and makes the deduction much harder.

Update: Upping my rating a little after more plays. The different abilities from the randomized "roles" that are in each game allow for it to play out quite a bit differently each game. I've seen games where the assassin used his power to kill off the other team's leader for a dramatic win, games where people just kept stabbing back and forth until most identities were outed and it came down to the final wound, and everything in between.

What if Castle of the Devil finished up in a decent timeframe? This design exchanges clever card play with much simpler attacking/defending as well as a hefty dose of deduction.

Unfortunately what it gains in pace it loses in drama, as player's allegiences will slowly come to light and eventually come down to a more gamey puzzling out than a dramatic finish.

That said, the game can be *very* quick and it's easier than it looks to re-set for another game, which has made this hit the table with a lot more frequency than other hidden roles games of it's ilk. For all its flaws, I think it's the best in its class, and will happily play whenever asked.

(I find it strangely inconceivable than in my 10+ plays I haven't *once* played with an odd number of players, and thus never have played with the monk/traitor/whatever).

Great hidden role game, good enough to become one of the top 3 games in the genre for me I think (will confirm after more plays).

While the artwork is not the best, the components are excellent in usual FFG fashion.

A great twist on the secret role genre. Offers a little more meat than, say, Werewolf with no player elimination.

Players try to identify members of the rival vampire clan before their own elder is staked through the heart. Needs a little more player interaction and silly Transylvanian  accents.

RATING: 5
Too much rule overhead compared to "The Resistance", for a not really deeper social deduction experience. Can be safely skipped.

Yikes. The art direction in this game is disastrous. I'd love to know the backstory, because Fantasy Flight has a legion of in-house artists that could have illustrated this nicely. As it sits, it's similar to the most embarrassing of Flying Frog's community theater card photos, except without any of the charm. Last year was sort of the "Year of Social Deduction Games"and I think this may have made a bigger splash had it not been so hard to look at. Even the box cover is embarrassing, I guarantee not single copy of this was impulse bought off the shelf.

As a game it's both quick and simple, roughly on par with Coup complexity wise but without the card counting. Players are split into teams, with a goal of eliminating the highest ranking enemy vampire, usually the Elder. The trick is that no one knows what teaneveryone else is on until they figure it out. Everyone has three hit points that are represented by some symbols and number tokens. When they take damage, they have to reveal one of their Hit Point types by taking an appropriate token, slowly revealing their identity. 

This adds some great tension to the deduction aspect of the game, since only one player can ever get eliminated. When a team decides to go in for the kill, they have one shot at it. If they guess wrong, their team instantly loses. It starts off random, but quickly ramps up as more information hits the table.

I liked it much more than I had anticipated, despite the silly pictures. It's worth a pick up when it inevitably hits the clearance racks.

Our group loves this game, warts and all.  The "art" is hilariously cringeworthy, but everyone loves the Mewbs!

Blood Bound is a unique sort of deduction game but also slightly fiddly. For players looking for a social deduction game in the style of Bang! or Resistance but want something with just a little more going on, this is one worth trying. I won't be clamoring for repeated plays but I don't think I'd turn down a game either.

Pigsticker is one of my favorite words, and now it's a playful game piece for kids.

Blood Bound is tolerable with 6 players because it's so short and stabby.  I might try it with up to 8 people, but maybe not since it'll just be longer.

One drawback is that the Harlequin character, who pretends to be in one faction but is secretly in the other, makes the game pretty random.  But it's pretty random anyway.

The Resistance (original or Avalon) is certainly better.

that one vampire deduction game.

got it for $3 at bring n buy TABSCON. - It's a light high number deduction game. That's fast to play. You'll never have a two hour final round like with The Resistance. Downsides are because the game does't have a lot of shakability in losing. You can slip into losing and be unable to come back very easily.

A very fun vaguely Werewolf-esque game with two equal teams. It's quick and tense and baffling and has plenty of stabbing other players, which is always fun!

But it's very sensitive to number of players. It really needs at least 8 and preferably 10 (and maybe 12, but we haven't managed that yet).

And it doesn't work that well with an odd number of players either, as one player has to be neutral to both teams and out for themself, which gives them a fairly big advantage.

It's an okay deduction game. I like that you don't know your team until people have taken several wounds, and still might not even know then.  The "cover your card" thing is cool when you're showing your neighbor ... I thought that was clever. The designers also made the right choice allowing the "stabbed" to become the first player, rather than having a standard turn order.

Social deduction game. Don't like the genre overall and this wasn't a particularly good one.

Can be quite difficult to explain & understand the rules on the first game, but stick with it. On 1st game I'd recommend don't use abilities so people get used to the basic dynamics of the game.

Quick deduction game that plays 6-8 well. The odd number inquisitor role is weird and quite hard to play right.

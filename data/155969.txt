Fantastic game.  Played once with 3 players and there was a lot of player interaction and fight over the use of building and resources.  Such a simple, but deep game.  I can see this one playing quick after the first play, but definitely prone to PA for some people.

Lots of nice mechanics in a small package. Constantly changing building actions, character abilities and some optional rules make this a nicely replayable game.
Reminds me of Dominion, except that this is much more dynamic, a bit more chaotic and perhaps more family-oriented.
Sad that it's only for up to 4 players but it would get really long otherwise.

2 plays / 2,4 players

LIKE: I like the card powers, which can really cause some chaos in the market. Great artwork, great theme.

DISLIKE: The game is a bit shallow, the choices after the first few turns are not as interesting. High amount of randomness in which buildings appear can cause advantages for some players, and less for others.

OVERALL: Although the market mechanism is interesting, it's too chaotic to create strategies and quick turns, so downtime between turns is pronounced. I don't know if the game is rewarding enough to keep my interest among other competing games, especially at that gameplay length.

Kickstarted & received.

RATING: 6
Quite dry in comparison to the cartoonish artwork. Wonderful box size and the market mechanic is fun. The stack of different buildings should make each game play differently but doesn't seem to be the case. Feels at home amongst its cousins in the Tiny Epic series, but Tiny Epic Galaxies is probably just better (comparing similar worker placement games).

Would rather play TEG, removed from collection.

I like this game, but I want to like it more.  It's small and clever.  There's a lot of game in this box.  The mechanics all appear to work out well...but the game seems a little unbalanced.  It goes on longer than it feels it should.  Many of the cards punish your neighbors so much that it just unnecessarily lengthens the game.  There are way too many top hats, and I never felt like I could build an engine.  So close to a great game...

If TMG just kept making worker placement games in the Belfort/Harbour world, I would be a happy guy. Love these characters/art style. Great worker placement with variable set up (2 of my favorite game mechs) and even the resource management is interesting (though also frustrating at times.)

1st play: Played before bed 2p with the wife and the game seemed meh, but need a couple plays to be sure, since this wasn't the ideal testing environment. The buildings mostly do the same types of things and not much game to playing the market. 

2nd play: Played under better circumstances and the game was still meh.  Very little tableau building and buildings are mostly samey. Didn't hold my attention but the production values are strong.

Another nice Scott Almes game in a small box. Easy to learn and teach, this plays smoothly with 1, 2 and three players (I haven't tried it with 4 players yet and most of my games have be solitaire so far). This is a fairly simple game and I suspect its replayability is relatively limited, even though there are a decent number of building cards to buy and a variety of character cards to choose from. Of the two Scott Almes games I have played I prefer Tiny Epic Galaxies. Having played a few more games, it's clear that the heart of the game is the market and that really only shines with 3 or 4 players.

This game completely retired Le Havre for me. I am sure plenty of people would take issue with that statement, but they scratch the same itch so far as I am concerned. Also the built in economic fluctuations are simple to understand while modeling a volatile but predictable market. A great little game that I have had great success teaching to a lot of people.

RATING: 2
OH MY GOD! This may be the most boring game we have ever played. It's been hyped as a light version of Le Havre. In that aspect the description is correct. But while Le havre is an engaging game with lots of decisions, Harbour is neither engaging  nor filled with decisions. Like Le havre you get one "worker" to place each round in order to get goods to sell for profit and points. There is a revolving market that over the course of the game makes some goods worth more and some worth less. the market movement is not secret so you can plan for it. However, for the first 3rd of the game the only thing you will be doing is placing your worker on your only player board each turn just to try and build up goods so that you can sell to that market. Plus what you have to do is so obvious each turn given what the market wants that it makes the game play dull. The only really strategic thing you are doing is trying to build up to sell or buy from the market. And that is basically the game. You look at the market, establish what you obviously need to do and do that.

Played this only with 2 players so far.  So, that's why I'm leaving this rating at 7.5, just to see if adding more players takes this thing off the rails or not.  Fun little game in a small package.  Some have said the market is too unreliable and it takes your legs out.  But, hey, that mimics real life markets, it's never predictable.  I'm more a tactical gamer, reacting to what's in front of me, than a strategic gamer.  So, this style of game is right in my wheelhouse.  For $10, you can't go wrong.

A good if unspectacular game where you're purchasing buildings in a fantastical harbor (in the Belfort setting) for victory. Can take auctions on your player board, the other players' boards, and of course the action cards out in the marketplace. Use the various character cards, and the game becomes a little more interesting. Good art, and fun enough, but I do wish the fantasy was felt a little more in some of the mechanics. As it stands, another solid small Euro with more game than its size would indicate.

This game wasn't bad. It was just blah. I didn't care about the fantasy theme. I was only in it for the gameplay, quickness, and price point. Unfortunately, it wasn't worth it. The price point and game speed were great, but the gameplay was incredibly boring. The option for solo play was nice, but this ultimately was not worth keeping around at all.

RATING: 7.3
Trying to boost interaction made the market too chaotic. Spending an action to manipulate the market only finds you a round later randomly helping other players and still not at the position you recently tried to build. Having only 4 buildings as game end condition hurts the development aspect of the game. The game seemed to have a good base, but trying to make it lighter perhaps hurt it.

Initial Impression: There's a big game hidden in this little package. Although not a microgame, the wonderfully produced components are few in number. In this game of tableau build/worker placement, players are trying to add 4 buildings to their tableau in order to end the game with the highest score. At first glance the game seems like a light filler but there's actually a significant amount strategy and tactics involved in the form of the market manipulation mechanisms. The drop in commodity price of even $1 can have a significant impact on players' success and efficiency becomes extremely important. Multiple layers of strategy become evident when you become aware of what your opponent is attempting to achieve. Overall, I'm looking forward to exploring this big little game.

Light and enjoyable. The games are fast enough that you can get through a few in one setting, which lends itself well to the large variety of characters you can chose from. The mechanics are fun, though I feel it is easy for one player to pull into the lead and stay there in two player mode. Also, when using custom characters, some can be very advantageous depending on starting setup, making the outcome a forgone conclusion. I'd like to try playing with more than two people as I feel the extra players would make it harder for one character to dominate.

This is the game I wanted Inland Port to be (it plays more than 2, and it does A LOT of what I love about Le Havre), and it does it with a tiny footprint and a quick playtime. It's deceptive, because worker placement with one worker sounds meh, but it's not. Not even a little bit. This is a huge game, and it endears itself a wee bit more with every play.

The grade is for the 2 players game. With 4, it's a 3. Total chaos, no way you can expect what the market would be, no way to prepare or respond, it becomes tactical. Buildings are pretty similar between each other. No choice when buying a building: always the most expensive one. Needs polishing the game more.

I'm a big fan of games that give a selection of cards, and then have the players figure out the best course of action to optimize the use of those cards.  Harbour does this pretty well, offering variety by way of only using a small subset of all the potential cards each game.

Game play is pretty basic.  Take your guy, put him on a card, and do what the card says.  Most cards give you resources, allow you to mess with a market that determines good values, or allow you to spend your resources to build a building.

Once a player builds 4 buildings, the game end is triggered, and the most points wins.  Each building is worth some points, and each player has some secret bonus points to score.

Overall, pretty neat-o.

Very clever game in a small box. The game  becomes a gamer's game when played by two players, meaning there is less luck,predicting and anticipating market movement is possible. Contrary to what others say, this game is very well balanced. Because players have access to everyone's cards/buildings/abilities. This is about being more efficient than your opponents and figuring out the best possible combos from the laid out cards. Balance issues imo should be non existent in this type of game.

Enjoyed this one more than I thought I would. It plays quick and there is a nice amount of decisions to be made each turn about where to place your worker. A fair amount of the buildings simply do resource conversions, but there are some more interesting ones as well. The player powers were a nice touch, and while the market does take a turn or two to get down, it's not that bad. Yes it can change a lot, but to me that's part of the game and keeps you thinking tactically which I enjoy. Hopefully will be able to get this on the table again soon.

With few exceptions, every turn is "trade one commodity for two others until you have enough to cash in for a building." If all other games were to be eradicated from the earth I might be persuaded to try this again. But life is too short and just about any other game would be less boring.

I'm not sure there is a good game here, but even if there is it doesn't really matter. Most of both my plays was spent trying to explain the unclear iconography to folks and that soured both me and them on the game. There are some inconsistent art decisions (all cube boxes have a plus on some cards and they don't on other cards) that make the play unclear and absolutely no backup or FAQ data in the rules to provide support for the unclear icons.

The beginning of the game can really drag if there aren't a good set of buildings to work with in the initial setup. The rules suggest a default set of buildings to start with for beginners which we didn't do and I definitely regret that. 

The end is abrupt and without the added bonus cards, you really feel like you are getting screwed if you don't have enough resources to build an extra building on your last turn. Since the market is very chaotic and difficult to predict, you don't even feel like you have control enough to even set yourself up so you are ready to build that last building. With the bonus card, you've at least got a goal to work towards if you know you aren't getting a final building.

As most people have said, the character roles feel unbalanced. Since the game is already pretty chaotic and you feel like you can't control anything, having one person who can do a lot better is very frustrating.

This was another major KS bust for me. I have no idea what game Joel Eddy was playing for his Drive Thru Review, but it doesn't seem to be the same game I played.

RATING: 5
Feels too slow, but then ends quick. If only buildings accomplished a little more, and yielded better combos, and the end goal was a little further off to make up for the increased power...

Seems so close to being good, like most TMG games I've Kickstarted. I don't know why TMG can't seem to take designs from almost good to actually good more often. The game is beautiful, and has so many interesting pieces, but it's really just missing the fun...

This is too short to really get in. The theme is very pasted on and mechanics are too fiddly for a small game like this. You could never really do what you want in the game as it is really short. This was a real miss for me, but not a complete collapse of a game. I could be strongarmed into playing it again if I must, but please don't. The art is neat for this small little game.

I absolutely love the art in this game.  It comes in a tiny box which makes it easily portable.  It plays very quickly with decent mechanics.  I've only played it two player, but think the game would get better with more.  Great filler game.

I've heard this game referred to as a mini version of Le Havre.  Having just played Le Havre at KublaCon May 2016, I can say it really is not the same.  Le Havre is much more gradiose and requires a lot more planning and strategy.  The only real similarity is that its located at the Harbour and shares a couple similar items.  I do not consider this Le Havre Jr., it's just Harbour.

This game seemed unbalanced in special powers available to each player.  After playing a second time, I dislike it even more.  It is all about planning ahead to buy buildings with the market just right.  But other players can change the market before your turn by buying a building or playing on 1 of the buildings that has that as a power.  So much time is spent on each turn analyzing the market, seeing what building your opponents may build and how it will affect the market.  It has a very weak build your own engine (discount on buying, etc), but it is very limited since the game ends when a player builds 4 buildings.  All in all, each turn takes way too long and is not very enjoyable.

I had watched vids, read reviews, and finally acquired Harbour and played it.  This game is an incredible value.  It is a prime example of how to get "a big game into a small box," without sacrificing...much.  This could have easily been printed to consume double its table space...and at double its price.  As much as I like "bigness" in games, I love the economy of this one.  The design is tight and efficient, and the price point is affordable.

Well done Scott Almes and TMG!  This will go with me to every game night for some time ahead.

added: My rating stands for 3-4 players.  Not as strong with only 2, and only mediocre as a solo game imo.

added more after a few more plays with 4: This game has been traveling with me ever since I've acquired it.  I Still really like it, but I'm beginning to wonder about its long-term replayability.  My comments above stand.  This game really is an incredible value.

Update:  When people hear that this game takes about an hour, the general sentiment is, "Why not play Game XYZ then?"  I somewhat agree as, despite it's solid gameplay, it's not an epic euro game.  Though it takes a pretty good chunk of time to play it.

I've traded it away purely because it has ceased to travel with me, and it's getting no love in my home.

Pros: Really tough market mechanism that forces players to attempt to anticipate what their resources will be worth by the time they want to use it. Good components and neat art.

Cons: Some building powers seem rather useless or counter productive compared to others. I could be wrong but the building cost, VP, and symbol bonus appear better than the building ability.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Has elements I like, some I don't.  The way the market is affected by other players felt vaguely like Alhambra like (though completely different of course) providing a tension which is one of the main appeals of the game.   Limited plays so far but seems like choosing cheaper buys to out race others to complete the 4th building early is a winning strategy.   Some risk that's the best/only strategy and if that proves out will diminish the appeal to me along with it feeling like it drags at times (4-player) with some players who may spend more time on turn decisions than the depth of game really demands.   Perhaps best with 3.

This evening our copy of "Harbour" sailed into our haven. My wife and I played it twice and we both agree that this game is one of those little diamants you sometimes find on Kickstarter. It is a smooth playing game, with beautiful and funny artwork. Theere is a big re-playability of this game because of the length of it (we played the games within one hour) but also because of the diversity of the cards and characters. A great micro-game.

The game hinges upon a market mechanism which is both frustrating and ingenious at the same time.   The building cards function quite a lot like Le Havre or Ora&Labora.

This game had 'meh' written all over it.  While it functioned well enough for us to kill some time (I guess it succeeds at that), it seemed pretty pointless.

2016-12-19 : As in real life, timing is everything. Played and rated as a 2-player game. Again this is a game I'd only play with 2, otherwise it becomes too long and chaotic.

After printing it and trying it with a few more people, I've got some interested and looking out for the kickstarter! :)

And yes, it works great as a gateway game ;)

It's possible it's my play group, and the fact there's usually more new players than people that have played it before, but 45 minutes is *really* optimistic.

The game doesn't ramp up much, a little bit with the coins and other symbols, but generally by just a few dollars.  (and slows down to a a painful crawl if Tax Office comes out, but that's another post...)

The market is just *so* volatile it's really difficult to plan.  You're best bet is just get high amounts of all the goods before you pull the trigger and buy something.  Although once in a while, it'll go your way and you will buy efficiently, but it mostly feels like it was luck, or an oversight of another player.

Great art, but this game really feels not playtested enough to me.  I'd like to see some tweaks in how the market works to help speed up the game.

Includes [gameid=161771]

Light worker placement game with fun theme/art.  Best with 2 players (can anticipate the market), okay with 3 (maybe goes a bit too long), worst with 4 (chaotic, can't plan).  About 15 min per player.  

Great artwork/theme, although it is somewhat pasted on.  Basically an economic game of optimizing resources by trading and a simple market.  Many building abilities are similar, but fortunately the character abilities help keep it replayable.  First player slight advantage.  Quite an impressively thinky game for a small box card game. 

Minuses are that buildings are fairly similar ideas, market if volatile and frustrating for player who buys second, and too long with 3/4 players (see my thoughts [url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/22062896#22062896]here[/url]). 

Would recommend only as a two player game for people who like worker placement and optimization, and looking for a quicker/lighter game that still requires thought.

Harbour's distillation of decisions and pressure is really working for me. The game length feels perfect for what it is. It's a condensed and compacted Le Havre.

First, you need to assess the available actions on offer for the game -- there will be a pool of buildings that’s different every game -- and then use those buildings to gather and rejigger your stock of goods. A lot of the actions in the game net out to a gain of only 1 or 2 goods, but the key – and part of the ostensible fun of the game – is using these actions to effectively trade your lower value goods for the higher value ones. 

Now here comes the other half of the ostensible fun: once someone sells, the values of the goods in the market change and you may discover your stock is now upside down in value. Timing your actions to strike when the market is right and earn enough money to buy a big VP building is a lot harder than you think!

I find it plays best with 2-3P whereas 4P gets pretty chaotic.

The buildings and variable player powers add a fair bit of variety to it as well.

What I don't like: 
- I'll just say right up front, the rules are not good at explaining how things work and you're rather left up to figuring them out on your own. However, you can quickly clear that up by watching the Rodney Smith Watchitplayed video. You'll see very quickly. 
- The text on some of the buildings was difficult for us to discern as to exactly how they work. Once we covered up the text and just focused on the icons, we were able to play it better. 

What I liked:
- Really small box, you could take this one almost anwhere
- You can solo it, although I've yet to give that a whirl but I will at some point before I hit the casket. 
- This little box is a really good little brain burner (for it's size), and it'll make you squirm trying to figure out how you want to play your next pawn movement. 
- Although at the time I wrote this up, I had only played one game, I think this little box will have a lot of replay due to the amount of character cards.
- I love the mechanism of how the market shifts, and some of the buildings work to shake things up.

A quick card game with resource management, cute art and humorous cards.  Maybe actually plays a little TOO fast for me.  I think the mechanic's interesting enough to justify a little more weight here.

I probably still like full Le Havre better, but I suspect I'll get Harbour to the table far more often.

I wound up liking this alot more than I thought I would after initial perusal...it really forces a player to try to maximize the efficiency of their play, and sometimes I suspect you need to play defensively and try to hamper others when you aren't ready to buy yet, but others are and they can buy the higher point valued building and you can't...

Some of the player powers seem a bit stronger than others (first impression...may also have had something to do with the way the building cards came out, and the fact that we were playing two player, which exposes less buildings, thus less combo options).  I would venture that this is probably better with higher player counts.

Light worker placement game based on shipping goods; shades of Le Havre in building activation mechanics, but much lighter.  The goblin theming doesn't do it for me. Pretty chaotic with 4 players - market jumps around all over the place.  Will play different every time with character cards and initial layout.

This game goes quick!  A 2 player game takes 30 minutes, tops, and the game mechanics and card abilities are easy to learn, thanks to clever graphics.  Each turn only nets you 2 resources, but turns come so fast you often regret a decision you made a turn or two ago because you didn't have the foresight to predict the market.  That means there's strategy to every turn.

The game is fun because you have to foresee what resources your opponent is going for so you can plan to take advantage of the market once it gets rearranged.  One downside is that cards that rearrange the market are too powerful, since the market drives nearly every decision that you make.  

Finally, the game comes in a nice, tiny package so you can bring it anywhere you expect to need to kill 30 minutes with a friend.

This is described as simple worker placement game with just one worker per player. Nothing wrong with that, but you spend most of your turns gaining one resource or two, until you have enough to buy a building. Then repeat that three times. The cards are all unique but boring, most of the time giving you those one or two resources. maybe three near the end. Nonetheless, because of the often unclear iconography, almost every time a new card is revealed, you have to pause the game to read the accompanying text.

I disliked that fact that although you have to pay a resource to use (and temporarily block) other players' buildings, this payment is easily negated by an icon present on many cards. Also, the starting special powers/buildings are not well balanced.

The market is the only interesting thing, but unfortunately it makes the game extremely chaotic. Every resource actually has the same price, but the market determines how many units you must sell. The problem is that it changes completely every time someone spends resources, not to mention various buildings that manipulate it.

The game is not totally bad, but it lacks interesting decisions and can be decided on any bit of randomness. The "funny" artwork, which is supposedly a selling point, does nothing for me, either. I might play it again, but I'm glad that I passed on its Kickstarter campaign.

Once you understand it this is a good game for its size. However , the rules are inadequate as you can tell from the number of rules questions and FAQ in the game forum. The mechanics of the game are straightforward, but the interactions between many of the Character Abilities and the Building Actions are not documented to the standard you would expect of a published game.
The Solo game suffers even more from this lack of clarity. The rules for the Solo game are printed in detail on the back of the Character card, which is just silly and impractical.
You can, of course, work around these things ... but my point is that in a decently published game you shouldn't have to.

Le Havre: the card game.  With the ability complexity and unbalance of Innovation, but without Chudyk's knack for making combo interactions that are actually FUN.  Just a stream of different "gain 1 or 2 resources" "transform resources" "Sell" abilities.  Although the restrictions on selling seem arbitrary, overall the market pricing mechanic was interesting, and could see implementation in a game that suits it better and warrant the designer some acclaim.  But in this game, when 3/4's of turns are simply taking resources, when the value of those resources gets changed just before you can buy it is extremely unsatisfying.  I would probably consider playing it again except for that fact.

If you enjoy resource management and economic games, then you'll like playing Harbour. I appreciate the varied difficulty that came with playing different character roles. Harbour also makes for a puzzling solo game, whereas the training dummy serving as your opponent steadily ramps up the challenge. The dummy isn't as stupid as it looks! Harbour is thoroughly engrossing and offers a new experience every time you play. Instant favorite!

Not a bad attempt at cramming engine-building, building-building complexity into a small box, but in the end the experience of playing it was quite humdrum. Lots of options on the buildings but frequently they were only marginally better versions of the starting 'take two goods' action. 'Lose one good and gain three' isn't very exciting. Doing it a dozen times even less so. 

The art is nice, fun and quirky, but I wouldn't have minded seeing a little less of it if it meant the card text was a bit bigger. 

Ultimately there are lots of better games that fill this niche.

This game is clever. You're constantly trying to find combinations of worker placements to get you money quickly—while trying to block other players and make sure the market is in your favor (and hoping someone else doesn't change it otherwise)! The market mechanic is brilliant, and delightfully chaotic. I really love how the theming explains many of the mechanics, though the buildings' abilities don't always reflect the building itself, theme-wise. The solo variant is a lot of fun, though lacks some of the strategy of the multiplayer version. Also, the rules are not detailed enough.

Reading the reviews I was afraid that the market system would be too gimmicky and might make the game too random. Fortunately, its actually quite easy to plan for the market and its a nice mechanic to have in the game.

My gripe is actually how slow it takes to get the game going. With 3 resources at the start, players need to spend at least 3 boring turns doing nothing but collecting resources in order to start building. Maybe a variant would improve this aspect of the game.

Players visit buildings in a fantasy themed harbor to collect resources, which are later spent to purchase buildings. The goal is to purchase 4 buildings and end the game with the most victory points. Market conditions change each time a building is purchased so that the value of resources are constantly fluctuating. This game is simple to learn and has a plenty of different characters so that it feels different each time. A unique worker placement game.

A little too much take-that for my liking. The artwork is charming as hell, and the flavor text is inspired. Don't think 2 is the ideal player count.

While certainly not a bad game, the puzzle aspect of selling and the ever-changing nature of the buildings made this game essentially a non-starter for my group.  It felt like work -- the whole time we were trying desperately to get goods, but no one was ever able to get ahead.  Add to this a player with severe AP problems and the experience was flat -- a total flop.  I recognize the game has potential, but it just doesn't deliver.

Makes you plan for something that will surely change. You can't just not plan because it takes a few turns to line up a score. You have to hope the goal line doesn't shift on you, and when it does you get to engage in an unfun tug of war to undo what everyone did. Just total crap.

The moving mark of the marketplace can be a bit frustrating as can be the wait after a purchase to try and build one's supply of goods back up.  I'd also recommend to avoid putting the Tax Office out in your first game...;-)  There is definitely some resemblance of Le Havre.  

After a second play, I'm just not enjoying the minimalist exercise of the game - while there might be a mini engine to build, there isn't much one can really put together before the game is over.

This game is nice as a less intense version of belfort with a bit more luck influence as what comes up in the deck has more to do with defining your strategy, but it's mitigated luck so I'm okay with it. However it can feel a little slow at times when you can only collect one or two resources for like 3 turns in a row. The great thing is that it has solo play with the training dummy so you can enjoy it when you're bored and by yourself. It's also a bit quicker to pick up than most resource management games.

Harbour (I assume the odd spelling is thanks to its European origins) is a pretty good little trading/building game with a solid Euro-mechanic and a theme that's there to keeps nerds interested.  It's not in the same league as Jaipur, but it has a similar dynamic, and like Jaipur, it has a big advantage in being relatively portable despite a certain degree of complexity.

The art is cute enough, and the blend of fantasy and trading themes works fine even though it's not really necessary. It's got decent replay value and is easy to learn, and it's a good bar game if you want something deeper than usual but don't have a lot of space.

I played this a dozen times with all player counts before publication and overall opinions were favorable. Sometimes it seemed a blowout but that's just the way the scoring in this game works.

Having played the final version it's basically the same game with some end game bonuses. Our last game was VERY close, then ended in an 11 point difference in the end. It felt almost impossible to deny the leader. Perhaps that's just an exception, hopefully time will tell. I would just hate for close games to suddenly become a runaway in the latter half of the game.

Surprisingly fun game, when you let go of thinking of it as a worker placement game and think of it as a game where you time the market.  It's a very smart design at 2 or three players.  However, adding more players makes the market too chaotic to even attempt to predict, and the game become random.

RATING: 6
While the game gives some great replayability and diversity, one of the major issues with the game is sometimes the card draws are not in ANYONE's favor and thus making the game feel like a slog.  If your draws have very little resource production resource or lots of market manipulation, barely anything will get done.

For example, if the card draws barely have any resource production or exchange, most of your turns will be simply going back to starting building.  On the other hand, if you do draw the right cards to get the necessary resources, the market fluctuations will drive you crazy since the state of the market will completely change if one person buys a building.

However, as a two player game, I do find the game to be playable since the market doesn't fluctuate so much and each move is crucial.

At the end of the day, I find Sushi Go and Ra to be far better options for the same 45 minute time frame this game has.

I'm not sure why, but this game really strikes a certain chord with me, and I love it! Everything blends together just so perfectly. I've tried playing Le Havre a few times, and am just unable to get into it. Le Havre (I know it came before Harbour) just feels like Harbour with a bunch of added, unnecessary complexity. Harbour is just so streamlined, and nothing gets in the way of the game. I know a lot of people don't like it because of the market variability, but that doesn't bother me. It doesn't feel random, and out of control. It does have a lot of variability, but it's only directly affected by the players; it's not random. Sure, it's sometimes impossible to predict what other players will do, but it's better than a die roll which is completely random. So, I don't know why, but I really love this game. Perfect game play, perfect playtime, the artwork is top notch; I love it!

Expected March 2015 (though '50% likely Dec 2014' riiight). Of course the "Holidays 2014" delivery date is for US backers only - the rest of us don't matter now they have our money, so I guess non-US will be waiting until March 2015. Still, they make no pretence to be "EU-Friendly"; but this is practically EU-Hostile.

In KS update #23 they announced Solo play included in the box and custom Meeples to replace the original generic ones. Also included are 2 bonus buildings (Clock Tower and Floating Dock), the Victory Lap card [b]and the Belfort Guilds Promo![/b] Nice!

As of KS update #24, shipping to backers is expected to start February 2015 so March 2015 delivery in UK is probably about right. Of course they keep spinning it as an "early" delivery, but that's BS for non-US backers

KS update #25: "Currently we fully expect to have all games start shipping out to backers 3/4 through Jan for early Feb receipt by most of the world"

I really enjoy worker placement games and while this is no exception it has an issue. I have played this about fifteen times now and whoever goes first has always been the winner and everyone else was right behind them. We are trying to decide how to houserule balance this, but until we do the first turn first player seems to have an undeniable advantage in my experience. I very much like the art and theme of this one too.

A nice little worker placement game where you are only really moving one worker around from round to round. The crux of the game is manipulating the market to your advantage so you can build better buildings.

Was hoping for a light version of Le Havre and this wasn't it.  Lots of card choices and player powers but they all do almost the same thing!  Usually your turn lets you get one more item then you had last turn.  3 wood to 4 stone.  or 3 wood to 3 fish or something like that.  Each turn is such a small incremental change it feels very un-fulfilling.

this one is one that was on my watchlist but I never made the jump to get it, it's a sort of Le Havre Light.

I must say I liked it more than what I was expecting...

Each character special power is unique... the buildings are great... and there's loads of both things in the game...
The art of this one is just superb!
It's a very cool thinky game because you have to leverage all the buildings available the best way you can so you can build faster than the other players.

The market part of the game is pretty cool and players will have to adjust and think ahead on what others might do to screw their plans, specially if there are buildings available that allow the players to rearrange the market prices!
The part that you have to have at least a certain quantity of the goods to be able to sell them depending on the price it is at the moment makes timing extremely important and deducing when and what the others will do that will make the market change is something you have to watch for!

There's no change in this game and so efficiency and timing are rewarded to avoid being wasteful... Very cool game indeed!

I overrated this a bit after my first few plays, but I think this game still deserves a really solid rating, as it's one of my favorite filler games. For all intents and purposes, all you're doing is churning resources into money, but I love the worker placement aspect coupled with the building abilities. Not all buildings are super useful, however, and some player powers aren't as good as others, which is why I think this has fallen ever so slightly for me.

Replaces La Havre for me.

An hour of pushing cubes around in circles, mostly in a solitaire fashion. The market changes so sporadically, which makes no thematic sense. No long term planning is really possible. Most of the time you need to manipulate the market to your favour and then it immediately crashes. Who wins can be decided by who is losing, or by someone that can change the market for the following player. A Kickstarter game that reiterates the power of a highly visual campaign with undeclared paid previews.

The art is nice, the game play simple, but deep enough. Players simply take an action each round, but they cannot take the action they took the round before or the action the other players are currently on. Quickly build to 4 buildings and see who wins the game. Good and fun. Now that I've played it a few times, I'm foreseeing this as a staple in our "couples" games collection. Maybe not Traders of Carthage level, but still will see plenty of play.

The market/shipping mechanism was cool, if chaotic. The special abilities were unbalancing, I'd say egregiously so in the game I'd played, but that happens when a clueless player ignores a deterrent. So I'd use the starter side next time, or depend that decision on the savviness and number of players.

Small box size plus a short playtime makes for a great lunchtime game.  Harbour is very chaotic, I don't imagine I will ever want to play this with four players.  

Pros: Asymmetrical player powers, a neat theme and an engine that builds nicely as you go along. 

Concerns:
I'm wondering if it suffers from first player advantage but I need more plays/data.

Note:
Rating is for 2 players only, I've not played with more but I've heard it can really slow the game down.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
A short thinky tactic good looking game with an important random factor.

The box is very small, but sturdy and everything fits in very nicely. The art is good, the qualities ok.

Even if the concept is clearly inspired on it, the game play is definitly different from Le Havre. It still requieres some thinking, because there are many options, and you also need to anticipate what others will be doing in their turn. Still, any long term planing is doomed to fail in this game.

There's definitely some serious balance issues that suggest the game has not been tested enough. 

The builings left me a bit flat. Most of them are variations of the same buildings, there are no combos, no thrilling powers...

What I liked the least is that it requieres a bit of thinking, but even the best laid out plans will easily crumble if the other players don't do what you expect. Lots of thinking for a very small profit.

What I liked the most was its lenght. Yes, a 4 players game lasted 40 minutes. This is the only reason it's not already on my sell list.

I think it will improve with 2-3 players. with 4 is very difficult to plan anything, because the situation changes too much between turns.

Giochino semplice e simpatico, con un paio di idee originali come il cambio repentino e improvviso del valore delle merci che però rendono il gioco incontrollabile. La componente fortuna gioca un ruolo importante ma trattandosi di un gioco da 30/40 minuti non è un aspetto negativo. Ottima l'idea di offrire poteri diversi a seconda della fazione ricevuta, anche se non sempre bilanciate. Un piccolo gioco con discrete idee dove però rimane un po' difficile attuare strategie a lungo termine in virtù della forte interazione. Il meccanismo dello sfruttamento dei palazzi ricorda molto Le Havre visto che si può piazzare l'unico lavoratore su edifici personali, su edifici comuni o, pagando, su edifici di altri giocatori con 'obbligo il turno seguente di cambiare edificio.

It's difficult to break the massive wall of 'amateurish Kickstarter knock-offs', but Harbour has finally convinced me. An amazing amount of game in a small box: like a mini-Le Havre and Power Grid wrapped into one. The whole thing screams of ultra-fine balance and good playtesting, and the presentation is none too shabby either.

The only time I can remember a first-play of a 4P game  when the other three players have immediately gone away and ordered their own copy. This has to count for a lot.

RATING: 7
Very portable and attractive components make this a good game for gatherings and travel. It takes about ten minutes to teach and 40-60 minutes for a 4-p game. 
In many ways it is [i]Le Havre Light[/i]: players purchase cards depicting harbourside buildings, the buildings form a tableau of action spaces, players receive rent when others use their buildings. It is a much shorter game, however, ending when a player gets four buildings.
The game's central mechanism (and principal point of difference) is the resource market: players gain resources by using the building cards, then trade the resources to purchase buildings. There are four resources which are randomly assigned values of 2, 3, 4 & 5 at the start. These values are not the price per item (this is always $1), but the minimum number that a player can have in order to trade that resource. Whe a resource is sold, the player trades all of the resource - so if you have five of something, you want its value to be at five also, otherwise there will be wastage.
After trading, those resources drop to the bottom of the market and the others shuffle up in value. It's neat.

[i]This is only the second game I kickstarted and wow am I disappointed. Maybe I was expecting too much from this game, but it is very light and too streamlined. Your choices each turn are not very interesting, manipulating the market isn't all that exciting and that is basically the whole game. This is not the quick playing/ lighter version of Le Havre that some people are comparing it too. The decision space is just too limited. Even the building bonuses [i](each card has one of four symbols that give you a bonus)[/i] are really blah.

Enjoyable game, really didn't believe that one could do a worker placement game with a single worker.  Still takes a bit on the long side, but that is because it is new to the gaming fold.  I expect the time to drop as we get more used to it.

Played a 2p game with 6 year old son. Enjoyed the variable player powers and the need to foresee the market changes in order to make the most of the value of one's goods. Probably easier to manage at 2 player than at higher player counts. Felt that the secret point conversion cards were essential as well. Actually won the game by buying the 4th building and altering the market, thereby screwing with my son's plan but decided to backtrack after he started sobbing, allowing him to make the final purchase and ended up tying at 37 points. It was probably better to keep him interested in gaming in the long run. Would love to try one game with the wife and one with 3 players to see how different it would be.

The variety of buildings and special player abilities make it interesting.  The changing market prevents one from planning too far ahead.  Deciphering the card symbology is a chore.  The random card order can make all the difference as to who wins or loses.

Very Good Small-Box Game by Scott Almes and Tasty Minstrel Games! Meaty!

City-Building, 1-Worker Placement, Commodity Game with the game's end starting when a player has built 4 buildings. No hand management. Everyone's information is open to all. Cute and original, IMO.

2 player is nice, but I think it's better with 3 or 4 players. I have not tried either solo variant, yet.

Based on one play: A simple game where you move your character around to activate buildings with the goal of later selling good you received from these buildings in order to buy those same buildings. To sell goods you look at the market which sets a price for each good with a specific quantity needed to sell, however if you have more than the amount noted in the market you lose the extra. This one mechanics works well and it creates a nice and simple filler if not very exciting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I appreciate the attempt to create a good game with a small footprint, but this just falls short.  The abilities on the buildings are lackluster and you never feel like you are doing more than moving markers up and down a track.  The top hat mechanic also takes it down a notch or two.  The top hats allow you to use an opponents building without paying the fee.  But it is just too easy to get a top hat and it is not unusual for everyone to have one.  That just removes part of the reason for buying the building.

I can’t really express how much I disliked this game. Harbour tries to do something interesting with the market, but it creates an incredibly chaotic and tedious game around it. Most every turn is spent collecting 1 or 2 resources. Eventually, someone has enough to buy a building, which may make the resources I’ve been collecting useless. Then everyone spends more turns collecting a few resources at a time. It’s so damn boring everyone at the table was ready to quit halfway through the game. At least we thought we were halfway through, but the thing kept plodding along interminably. Ugh. Least favorite new game in a long time.

Yuck.  Hate the market and all it's randomness.  It's near impossible to plan when the central mechanic is constantly changing.  Sure it's tactical instead of strategic, but where I enjoy unexpected tactics in other games (like the unexpected  tactics in Nations), I find the tactics in Harbour lifeless and boring.  Pass.

I think it needed more play-testing to balance card costs. We played it half a dozen times, and each time, the lower cost cards would get purchased and the market would become clogged with high-priced cards which neither player could purchase. So for three or four rounds, nothing would happen as both players used turns simply to gather resources... causing game-play to stall. 

This game needs to be reworked (IMHO) so that the engine builds smoothly. We tried some house rules such as stacking the initial outlay with low priced cards, tiering cards so that high cost cards came out later. Oddly, nothing really smoothed out the engine building so we sold it.

The market mechanism is great though. If the engine-building issues were solved it would be a very good little game.

This is a game where on your turn you place a worker who gets you 1 or 2 or maybe 3 resources. The game ends when a player buys their fourth building. When something is bought, the resources used are completely spent, (even if you just needed a few of them, the bar goes down to zero) and then the values of the resources do a swap, so the stuff used becomes worthless and the stuff not used becomes expensive. This made for a dull and frustrating game, as when a player buys a building right ahead of your buy, the stuff you accumulated is no longer able to pay the cost of the building, and you have to spend 2 more turns swapping your stuff all around, so that another player can spend his 2 turns getting more stuff, and does it again to you. The resource thing, maybe I'd be willing to get more of a sense of if the actions were more interesting. When the most exciting thing I can do nets me 3 of a resource, It's just not enough.

Seems to be a timing game - where you gather buildings for you actions then gather and regroup the goods you get. Mostly there are one or 2 goods and you have to trade for the others. When someone sells the market adjusts so you have to time your sales to earn enough to buy a the big VP buildings.

I game I wanted to like because of it's small footprint and more than trivial game play (i.e. far more heavier than [gameid=129622] or [gameid=131357]).

The design is much less fiddly than [gameid=148951]: The quantities of the four resources are tracked with only four counters on a single track, but because whenever you pay with a resource, you pay with all of that resource, the fiddliness and chance of making an error are reduced.

Still, I don't particularly like worker placement games nor resource management games, but I'd like to try this again for sure.

We love the concept of it being Worker Placement without a board, love the trading of goods, as well as the ever changing exchange rate.  The only bummer is that when the buildings that are on the market for placement have to do with resetting the exchange rate, it can become redundant that when people don't have a move they just decide to screw up their opponent by exchanging the rate!  It gets worse when there is multiple exchange rate manipulation buildings in play.

We own this game because my wife kickstarted it. I have only played it once to date, and going into this play I had expected something light but enjoyable. Instead I found it to be not enjoyable at all - a pretty random game which nonetheless encourages huge amounts of AP. You can't really plan to build particular buildings because you can't predict what the market will be like by your next turn (while you can see what other players are likely to spend/buy, this only leads to more AP, and you can't even predict based on it because of the several buildings which allow players to manipulate the market), so it's basically a case of building whatever you can when you can, or otherwise staring at loads of buildings deciding which to use, before you realise that they're all variations on "pay X to get Y", and as I just said you can't even really guess which resources you need. On top of all this the player special abilities are pretty boring and don't seem at all well balanced.

I wouldn't absolutely refuse to play this again, but it really felt like a game with no reason to exist.

There is a surprising amount of depth and variety in the 2 player game.  Larger player counts may hinder planning and create chaos, but with small counts there is a lot of planning around balancing strategic efficiency against tactical response to the shifting market.

I'm not convince the player start cards are balanced or necessary.  The deck cycles at a slow enough pace that games are distinctive just by what buildings are on the tableau, so asymmetric starts is not needed for variety.  And some are clearly good and several undermine core mechanics.

Meh. It's not exactly exciting. You take tiny steps to adjust the levels of your goods. Buy buildings to make the game slightly more interesting as play progresses. Fool around with market values. Buy before the market price changes and foils your plan A. Sometimes you win and sometimes you lose. A bit dull really. Minimal worker placement blocking and sometimes market manipulation serve as player interaction. Building actions aren't exactly innovative or very interesting. Certainly not a patch on Le Havre. The game has nice bits and looks nice though. Love the box size. Okay for the solo gamer, or with two, but I'll avoid any further plays with more than two.

I like the mechanics for this game, but the distribution of buildings is unfortunately unpolished. A ton of the buildings don't do much of anything unless you have multiple of a particular symbol, but you only start with 0-2 of them and only a quarter of the buildings have more. The result is that a significant number of the buildings rarely do much of anything. With a better card distribution this could be a solid filler game.

RATING: 4
While Harbour is not a flawed design per se, it’s just an unbearably dull way to spend an hour. Gathering resources is a grind because the average action only nets you a single resource, and the market system is too volatile – at least in games with three or more players – to allow for proper planning ahead.

The purchasing of buildings could have been a mildly interesting decision point, because buildings offer some sort of permanent benefit for their owner. However, the game ends long before those benefits can be fully taken advantage of, so it usually obvious to purchase buildings with the best VP-to-cost ratio. I guess Harbour is just trapped in an unenviable situation where it feels simultaneously too short [i]and[/i] too long. Its physical compactness is a plus point – but that’s not saying much, really.

Bought after watching a couple of vids, but unfortunately not one that is going to stay in my collection.

Wifey finds it dull and the cards are too busy with too much iconography. Also the changing market has also frustrated others I've played with as well.

For me it's an ok game. But with only one worker to use and with the volatile market, many turns building up your resource ready to buy a card can be ruined by the person in front of you changing the market by purchasing a building or even using the card that changes to value of the goods.

It's like so many of TMG's titles: the concepts are good but the gameplay is a bit too opaque or generic to be really fun and suck you in. The actions are quick and so even though most actions only get you a resource or two, you are able to build buildings fairly quickly. The market is an interesting concept, but you often can wait things out a little bit to get it to work in your favor anyway. Overall, it just means the arc of the game is just very ordinary.

Fickle, ever-and-fast-changing market plus great variety of starting player powers and building actions makes this a fun resource management and conversion game, which generally isn't a very exciting mechanic. It is very difficult to plan - not so much with 2 and nearly chaotic with 4. Iconography and market mechanic are not intuitive. Still, doesn't out-stay its welcome and nice for casual gamers to bridge gap with more experienced players.

I understand the impulse to simplify or distill complex games (a similar experience in 20% of the time!), but it is so often the case that these games are interesting [i]because[/i] of their length. Harbour is such an ill-conceived reduction of Le Havre: players have one worker token which each turn moves to a different, empty building; if the building belongs to an opponent then a payment is required. Buildings usually provide goods either directly or by transforming of some goods into others. Others have special abilities, such as purchasing new buildings by trading in sets of goods to the current market.

There is no long-term engine-building here, however (preparing early on to turn acorns into trees into logs into planks into IKEA flatpack for furniture domination, or whatever); there are only four types of good and each can be produced by numerous primary producers. While the buildings themselves do offer assorted improvements that allow players' progress to accelerate, these are minor (such as a discount of $1 on buildings generally costing $9-10). It's a short enough game that these incremental improvements can be decisive, but they're never going to be satisfying.

The core of the game is really the market for goods, which changes so drastically with each sale that its prediction and manipulation is necessary for efficient building. But it changes so drastically with each sale that with more than two players is frustratingly unpredictable.

The solitaire AI is just about as engaging as other human players, so I'm fairly sure it's best played alone.

The Top Hat mechanic is pointless. You only need one and it completely nullifies the need to pay a toll price for using the actions of other players' cards. Some characters' starting effects even have a Top Hat already on them. Requires a house rule. Besides that, pretty fun micro game.

Played a two player game at BGG con.  thought is was a  nifty quick worker placement filler game.  Can be played before or after a heavy gaming session to either wind up or down from more meaty game.  This game is not fluffy but it is lighter than what I want for the main course. You play worker to the field building that are up for sale and pay the bank your resources or you play your worker to your buildings for free or to your opponents and help him.  That is the gist of the game.  Learn a few icons and the understand the simple but

tl;dr: [thing=35677][/thing] without the good parts.

Le Havre is in my top 2 ever (I'm not sure on which spot). So when a game comes along that takes some of the same elements and reworks them into a small, fast game, I take notice. More specifically this game takes the building part of Le Havre. It adds something too: a lot of chaos and luck. And that is what turned into a disappointment.
To be honest: I wasn't expecting Le Havre in under an hour, I was just expecting a nice little card game. The clear reference to Le Havre is just a nice extra. But the amount of luck combined with the game length, made for a sub optimal combination.
Still, not bad.

Has a nice look to it but so far it's really getting some bad reviews. I'll probably end up pulling my Kickstarter pledge as the game seems to have some real flaws.

TMG seems to be pulling another Dungeon Roll: the game has a ton of hype and a ton of funding, but ultimately it's just mediocre.

Update: Having now played the game, it is actually worse than mediocre. It's outright bad. The market is too chaotic (and not in a good way), the game drags on for way too long, and some of the buildings are much more useful than others. So it becomes a game about getting to the useful buildings first, while hoping that the market doesn't change too much before your next turn.

Sold.

Le Havre light (and like, waaaaaay light).  But a hell of a lot of game in a tiny little box.  I will probably actually use this one to prime newbies to the idea of a shipping game and then step them up to Le Havre later on.  Lots of little mechanical things that seem odd and counterintuitive keep it from a great score, but this is another win for Tasty Minstrel in my book.

On the surface, and in the first 15 minutes of play, Harbour promises a light, scaled-down version of Le Havre that plays relatively quickly and that delivers a similar experience. 

As the next 45 minutes pass, however, two things quickly become apparent...

1. While mildly clever, the shifting market mechanic is too chaotic to allow for any sort of planning, especially at 3-4p.

2. While there are occasionally some combos to be had, by-and-large most buildings provide only a +1 or +2 to the standard resource gathering players' home buildings provide (the more swingy ones that let you trade 3+ for 4-5+, usually only of a single good, are too situational due to point 1, making steady but minimal gains more viable).

What you ultimately get is an overlong, unchanging slog where what you do in turn 1 bears a remarkable resemblance to turn 10, with the extra symbols provided by buildings giving very minor discounts/advantages.

While the core of the game is mostly solid (and being based on Le Havre, there's no reason it shouldn't be), in shortening the game the designer also flattened it to the point of disintrest. If it either played in a shorter time frame or had a more appreciable sense of growth, it might be quite good. As it is, TMG once again proves their ability to take a great concept and only crank out a middling game.

RATING: 5.8
Clever worker placement game, where you try to gather ressources from the market. The price for those ressources always change when someone makes a purchase. So you can try to time your purchase, maybe what you need will be cheaper on your turn. The spots to place your workers change too, when someone "buys" them and puts them in their point pool. Then a new card is drawn and laid out to use.
The concept is quite similar to Fabelsaft, although it is a lot "thinkier", more difficult.
the playtime is a bit too long and a deficit is difficult to make up. The one with the most buildings seems to be the winner.
But aside from that, it's a very clever and interesting game. You will have to anticipate the markets changings in order to win and that's very very cool.
A high replayability is given too with the amount of buildings and different characters to use.

This might be the best micro-game I have played. It's surprisingly crunchy and manages to tug on the same parts of my brain as Le Havre, but with a quarter of the time investment. It takes a few plays to get your head around around the supply/demand part of the market, but since that's where all the game play is, that's probably a good thing.

Easily the best of its genre, it pretty much fired my entire micro-game collection, save Love Letter. I also don't see it getting old anytime soon, so I will probably save a few dimes not buying any new micro-games either. Not many games blow a hole in my shelves like this one, I highly recommend it to anyone who likes resource swapping games.

Fantasy-based economic, resource trading, city builder.  It is being compared to a micro Le Havre but it is a quick pace worker placement, goods conversion, with an elegant market mechanic.

Rating is based on solo play - I think the dynamism of multiplayer might make it worse or better, it's hard to say. Even if it does, I found that most of the time the choices are severely limited between cards that provide either one net good or two net goods, with three net goods being a possibility of you have lots of a particular symbol and the right card available. Because of the limited choices I stopped playing the solo game and I don't feel like the multiplayer game will be that interesting either. If certain combinations of buildings and abilities are in play then the choices may be interesting but much of the time I feel on auto-pilot.

I actually bought it to play as a solo game and I use one of the (20 turns) solo variants on BGG but am not quite satisfied with that version - it's too short, and the options are very limited for building purchases.  However I do see myself playing this game with some frequency though it won't ever be a top-tier for me.

I really want to REALLY like this game. I'm not feeling it quite yet. I've seen videos where the reviewers say this is a watered-down Le Havre. Seeing as how I've never played that, I have no basis for comparison. But what keeps me from really enjoying the heck out of this game is that it suffers the same as any worker placement game I've ever played. It just takes so damn long to ramp up. But the game is so short, by the time you really get going, the game is pretty much over. Also, there are too many top hats. I think it needs to be nerfed somehow.

Reportedly a lot like Tiny Epic Galaxies (and Le Havre?).

Worker Placement Game with a very small footprint for so much game. The spots for the workers are cards that are always changing as players buy them and they get replaced. There is always a very fluctuating market and variable player powers which make this game great. Players have to be very flexible and able to change their tactics every turn.

Not enough decision space here for my liking. All you really play with is timing...and even that is fairly obvious.

Won in a game giveaway at Con of the North. Thanks for the swag TMG!

I'd say this is about a Tiny Epic Kingdoms level of filler.  Easy to grasp Euro mechanics that are very pleasant in play and it doesn't overstay its welcome.  I'd say its even more enjoyable than TEK since it adds a bit more tension through the limited resources and buildings... but it still lacks a wow factor that makes me really want to get it to the table.

The game itself is pretty clever as its a market driven resource converter.  You want a certain amount of goods at certain times to sell for enough money to buy the best (most useful or high pointed) buildings.  This is tricky as every time anyone sells the market changes, sometimes dramatically.  While that can be interesting to plan for it also can feel very random and mean at times.

There's an app of Harbour, but it's really difficult to learn to PLAY Harbour from using the app. Harbour is a LOT like Puerto Rico (or maybe more accurately like it's smaller counterpart San Juan) but somehow, INFINITELY MORE CONFUSING. 

You build ships to get goods to ship goods for points. You need goods to build ships. It's a very chicken or egg thing. You can build buildings (or use others' buildings) to convert goods... ugh. It's basically complicated Puerto Rico in a smaller box, and due to the change in theme, without the problematic colonialism. I would probably have to play this 100 more times before I felt like I could play it strategically - right now every time feels like I'm learning it for the first time.

My wife loves this one, I don't like the randomness (who had the witch always won, for example). But in general, not a bad game at all.

Really good quick game with great art and fun title. Plays fast and has more depth than one can think at first sight. Lots of replayability and excellent market mechanics

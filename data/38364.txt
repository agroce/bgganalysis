I spent a lot of time teaching this game at Essen in a language I don't speak very well (German). As a result, I really cannot get excited about playing this -- that is the reason.

To be fair, this really is not a bad game... it's a basic tile-laying pick-up-and-deliver train game with some tactical elements that make this a decent play in a relatively short amount of time (45-60 minutes) and works with kids of all ages... 9-90.

2010-07-29 (rating 7.5):

A fine game for those who like both Carcassonne and trains.

Keeping "hand" of 3 tiles is a nice innovation. I will likely want to try it in Carcassonne as well.

I don't like the dice in this game. Maybe it would be useful to make a variant where moving through turns with too much steam requires even more steam rather than throwing a dice. As it happens from time to time that throwing 1 two times in a row leads to losing the game.

I would like to play this game with more than 2 players. As in 2 player games we haven't ever reached ending conditions and the game always ends because someone scores 13.

Carcassonne with trains. Pretty fun if a bit complex

You lay tiles to connect towns so you can deliver goods of a certain color to a town of a certain color, all the while making sure you have enough steam to mover your train. 

It's not a bad game, but not a great one. My biggest problem is that the early game tends to drag a bit, but then the end game will come out of nowhere. Suddenly someone will win, and you didn't realize what was happening.

In this tile-laying game you have to deliver different coloured good to their matching cities. The final score is based on the different sets collected. In order to deliver the goods you need to power up your train with steam, which you acquire by laying track tiles. It is a nice combination between the pick-up and delivery and tile-laying mechanics. The visuals are awful and the fact that is an older game, does not justify this fact. Luckily the gameplay compensates the lack of visuals.

This is a tile-laying game, combined with a pick-up and delivery mechanism. Every player has a train, with which they try to pick-up cube goods and deliver them to towns, in order to gather VPs. 
It's a fun game, in which the luck (the towns have randomly placed goods cubes on them) plays a moderate part.
Not too hard to learn.

Tile laying and route building, along with Age of Steam's picking up and delivering coloured cubes.  Scoring for both delivering cubes and building circular routes is a potentially interesting idea.  However, delivering a cube earns twice as much as completing a circuit and is very much easier.  It is really difficult to complete a circuit without setting up an opponent to step in and place the final tile ahead of you.

Speeding around curves brings a risk of derailing and wasting your turn.  This gives curves a utility in slowing down an opponent's delivery network.  Long, straight routes dotted with towns do appear to be the way to go, if you can get away with it.

Our one game of Days of Steam never came to life.  I think it is too shorn of the things like share dealing, train upgrade races and ownership of lines and stations that make railway games enjoyable (and admittedly last much longer).  There are novel elements there, but they either don't work that well or they aren't any fun.  This one sank without trace for our group.

Production quality is decent.  The artwork is a bit dull.  I had no problems with the few icons.

RATING: 6
Seemlessly blends tile and train mechanics to create a game that is both accessible and thoughtful.  However, a couple issues keep this from being truly great.  (1) The bonus goods scoring can feel a bit imbalanced when played as is (try the scaled down scoring of the expansion of +1, +2, +3) and there is too much at risk in the die rolls (the forums offer a lot of variants for how to treat derailments).  Overall while this game is still good, I'd rather pull out something like Carcassonne over this (this opinion changes however when you add in the expansion which through adding a couple more rules and fixing both the issues mentioned above transforms the game into a much more tactical and strategic experience).

On the components side: The Box is way too big and the wooden pieces aren't painted up to par with games released by other companies.

Underrated, tricky game, disliked by many. Equal parts planning your own moves (not too much looking-ahead) and trying to hinder those of your opponents. I like the "steam" mechanism (you have to lay tiles to get movement points) and don't mind the gambling (on not getting derailed) on a die roll to haul your freight on fewer turns. Each game will be different and should be pretty close. Plays well with two.

RATING: 6.5
Train games get a reputation for being either long, complex, and aimed squarely at dedicated gamers or as being extremely light, filler style games.  So when a train game falls into the middle, it's hard to rate it based on how well it stacks up to other games.  This game is excellent like that.  It's more sophisticated than a light filler (TransAmerica) and it's far simpler than a deep rail game (18xx).  Game play is a combination of track laying and pick-up and delivery.  The speed mechanic is an interesting twist that will be seen as either an annoyance or a clever little trick that introduces positional strategy.  Overall, the game is good, but not enough to really stand out.  But even so, it is a middle weight game that should be tried.

RATING: 4
I'd consider this more of a filler than anything else.  Our first play with was 60 minutes, but I imagine that you could cut quite a bit of time off of that.  

I'm used to train games being relatively low luck, but the derailment die for turns does add a variable to that.  I'm thinking that this is more of a family game than the heavier train games that I've gotten used to.

nothing really special. A bit too simple to really attract, but short enough to play some more.

After a second play I don't think I will play this anymore. The circuit building is not well balanced because it's always another player who takes the fruit of your work. And the dice makes the game below level.

Tile laying pick up and deliver game. I expected more from this, honestly. The tile laying is very restrictive, which takes away from the fun. Also, once you do get some tiles down, it is very easy to create a loop that is very optimal to your goals. Get the Locomotive expansion, makes the game way better.

It sounded like it had potential, but in the end it is a boring and slow-moving game with very few decisions to make, and those decisions can take many, many slow turns to implement.

I was also put off by the graphic design of the game components. It felt like it was done by someone with a simple paint program, or at Winsome, while the art on the box promised some highly-developed and polished presentation. It wasn't.

Nehéz bármit is mondani az első játék után,de azért egy picit többet vártam a leírás után. Nekem túl egyszerű, bár elég szórakoztató. Komoly kihívást nem érdemest keresni benne, de egy könnyű délutáni családi programra társasjáték terén megfelel. Én egy kicsit nehezítenék rajta. Talán az a legjobb része az egésznek, ahogy gazdálkodni kell a gőzerővel :)

Tile laying pick up and deliver train game, with a simple mechanic to build up steam by laying track and use up steam by moving your wooden train. 

There's added complexities though, with water towers and coal and loops of track giving bonus points etc. which makes this one of those super filler games.

Pick-and-delivery game with modular board not-so-exciting gameplay. Feels a little slow and could be a bit confusing. There is a main issue with game components and rules, related to the need of actually "mark" the starting city of each good-cube. This could lead to very bad and confusing situations during the game, expecially considering that the board setup is dynamic.

What a strange little game. Played once, not sure what to make of it. Some very clever bits, but also some very awkward ones (the circuits and upgrade tiles are hard to get your head around).

Build track or a station (and at the same time build up a head of steam) or move your locomotive (using up your steam) in order to deliver cubes (preferably of all four colours). Make loops between stations for extra points (not very thematic). Artwork uninspiring.

Tiene un regustillo Carcassone en lo que respecta a ir poniendo las losetas intentando no darle oportunidades a tus rivales. No es tan sencillo como aparenta en un principio. El juego gana en intensidad a medida que la partida avanza. El problema que le veo es que es demasiado largo, los primeros 20 minutos sobran por completo, no hay tensión, todos los jugadores avanzan al mismo tiempo, y sólo al final cuando la carrera por ganar está en pleno apogeo es cuando empieza a ser divertido. Con algún retoque podría ser un buen filler de trenes, tal y como viene ... no me gusta.

Players are contributing to the construction of a railroad network, as well as operating a train on the network.  Players on their turn have the option to expand the railroad by playing a Carcassonne type tile, and possibly building up a bit of steam in the locomotive's "steam bank", spending a turn at a water tower to really pump up the steam, or moving your train on the network by spending banked steam.  Moving trains is aimed at picking up cubes from towns and delivering them to towns that want that coloured cube.  Points are awarded for completing loops of rail, delivering cubes and diversity of cube colours delivered.  Neat little game, starts slowly as new players grasp the concepts (which do feel a little alien).  Play speeds up quickly, and it develops into a fast playing, but tactical little tile placement game.  You have to be on the lookout to not set up your opponents with a careless placement, and to try and put the expensive hills in their path when they are doing well.  Nice, with just a hint of nasty tossed in.  Neat little game, in a large box.

A fairly light pick up and deliver game with some randomness and very poor graphic design. Cheap doesn't have to mean bad. Teeny tiny symbols, solid dark green background make the game look ugly. Which is a shame since the game play is quick and fairly simple. I liked the mechanism to limit speed on bends, I liked the track building, I liked the build up of steam, I didn't like the confusion of loops, I didn't like the tiny symbols, I was uncertain about the scoring. A shame. A little more investment in the product would have made the experience better.

A fun and light pick-up and delivery game, easily played in 30-45 minutes. This game can be as brain burny as you'd like it to be, capable of pulling duty as either a light filler, or a more complex route optimization game. This game, is what you make it to be. You get as much as you invest. If you choose to agonize over every move, than analysis paralysis can easily set in. If you keep things light and airy: moving quickly, then the game can be suitable as lighter fare. "Days of Steam" is a solid light weight game, that is quickly learned and enjoyed. 

Components are solid and servicable. The rules are short and easily understood, with lots of pictures and examples. 6 out of 10.

I like the movement mechanism which is different from the many other train games I have played.

Days of Steam: Locomotives


Alone, the base game is okay, but has some issues.  The VP costing in particular was all wrong, so players who were lucky enough to be close to differently colored cubes usually won in a laugher.  The coal was never used because you never came close to drawing out the tile stacks.

The expansion fixes all of this and more; it takes an okay game and makes it something I think is actually pretty special.  If you're thinking of taking the plunge, I can wholeheartedly recommend this if bought in concert with the expansion.

It's a Steam-lite kind of game, a nice entry point to the pick-up-and-deliver genre.  It's a good production with nice bits.  Just be aware that the base game rules as written will lead to games that are over too quickly and too tilted towards players who get lucky to get a splash of goods cubes colors near them.

RATING: 5.612
Interesting little game.  My work lunchtime introduction to train delivery games.  Whilst understanding that it is simplified to keep it short, its an interesting game.  Only think is that the points for a completed circuit really end up being critical in determining who wins, and that is for me a non-delivery aspect.  So, that part of the game doesnt fit well, but still an interest game (Rating 7 - 26/12/10). UPDATE If I get the urge for a train delivery game, I would just go full Steam - so as unlikely to play, gone (Rating 5.612 Jan 17)

Since the kid isn't quite ready for Ticket to Ride (almost, but not quite), this was purchased on the cheap from Barnes and Noble so she could have a train game to play.

Tile laying, action/resource management.  Was actually quite fun, building the railroad and towns, connecting them all together and trying to reroute other players paths so as to make them have to take longer routes to deliver packages.  Some don't like the die roll for derailing, but we actually liked it.

Valley Games 2010 edition:

Nice gateway level game with a rails theme.  It has tile laying ala carcassonne, and pick up and deliver like Age of Steam.  There is luck in tile distribution, die rolls for derailment, and city/goods placement.  This doesn't bother me, but I know many will want to know this.  The hand of 3 tiles helps mitigate some of the possiblity of a "bad" hand, though all the tiles seem useful.  Even if they don't build your route, you receive steam resources even when throwing a monkey wrench into an opponent's track.  The tiles are thick enough to be easy to handle.  The wood train bits in my set were rough cut with some splintering.  I wasn't excited about that.  After punching all the tiles, everything could fit in a box 1/3 the size.  I'm finding this kind of over size boxing irritating.  I want to keep attractive packaging, but knowing it's 67% air will annoy me every time I look at it.

A Carcassonne-like tile laying game that pretends to be a train game, with a light pick-up-and-deliver mechanic. It is too light and trivial to be taken seriously as a train game, somewhat more complex than Trans America, but the repetitive cycling of the same boring actions, over and over, at 60 minutes is too long to be considered a good filler. With several hard-core "train gamers" playing this, the consensus was: "Let's play something else." or something like that. Meh.

Update (06/05/12): Who am I kidding? I am never going to play this again. It's a '2'.

Looks like a very simple train-game, but actually there's a lot of thinking and calculating. Good game, but I've never actually won. :) No stocks, no money, just cubes what you have to move to another city. But just when you finally got a road and the right city, the other player takes this cube for himself. :)

I like train games however rarely I have time for longer ones like 18xx series. This one is surely much simpler and less serious but there is strong "train" feeling and good level of tactical thinking.

I own Strata Max 1st edition. Big thumb up for cute wooden trains and small box - finally a game where box size is well fit with size of elements.

RATING: 3
Below average tile-laying and cube transportation game. The impact of the dice is too high. The points for constructing a "circuit" have a negative influence on the network building (no player wanted to give points to the next player). Gets boring rather fast.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Carca-Train would be an apt description of this game as you lay tiles to try and set you up to pick up and deliver goods to the appropriate cities of the same color.  There is room for some devilish play with track, but this is mostly a simple, straight forward game that plays very quickly.

Unfortunately, after two plays I've already tired of it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is an example of a game that I am only likely to play once because it was kind of a drag.  When laying tiles I typically played defensively since I didn't want to offer opportunities for circuits to others and the shipping element feels slow and lacks tension despite the press your luck element.

I'm really conflicted on this game.

It's fast light tile laying; it's got a simple system using action points; it's got simple pick up and deliver.

It's also counterintuitive in the fact that you often are reluctant to make moves like adding cities or creating loops as they work to mutual advantage rather than creating greater opportunity for yourself than other players.

It has the potential to be blissfully short, such as thirty minutes, which would certainly raise my rating. Another factor would be a couple other plays to find out just how strategic the set collection mechanism is and if that would make the risk/reward curve better.

Will either be a 7/8 or a 5.

Update:

5. I guess I'm too much of a fan of heavier train games to be able to enjoy this properly, but to be honest it feels even lighter than ticket to ride. I just feel like it's a game of holding back to do what will benefit your opponents the least.

RATING: 6.5
A bit too random.
Lost a game because had 1 on dice (anything else would save). This way I lost 3 turns (2 turns to recover 3 steam needed for that move and 1 turn to repeat move) and another player won. I'd say that failing a dice throw once shouldn't make you recover for 3 - 4 turns.

I think a rules improvement would be: If you fail throw you only loose this move (you go back from where you started) but keep steam unused.

Almost there! The idea is good, execution - less so. Tile-laying is fun, except you have to hold back in order not to help other people by giving them opportunities to make circuits.

Tile laying train game.  I remember falling behind early and was far away from the ability to pick up and deliver where someone else was able to do so back and forth quickly.  I couldn't play catch up due to a mechanic that makes my train tip on turns.  Seemed to be too luck dependent on what tiles are coming out and where your train is when they do.  I also found it comical that in a four player game, there was a three-way tie.

Turns are either place a Streetcar-style railtrack tile to earn movement points, or spend those points moving your train along the tracks picking up coloured cubes and dropping them at a matching coloured town-tile for VPs a la Age Of Steam. More cubes come out everytime you choose to place 1 of the 2 available towntiles rather than a normal track tile, so there's plenty of choice on how the map gets constructed. Making things complicated is that closing a track loop earns VPs as well, so you don't want to be creating opportunities for opponents to do that. It seems to be a game of building in hope really. You may place tiles in such a way that there's a good place near your train to place a towntile so that you can get to the new cubes first and perhaps create some low-distance runs for easy VPs, but of course if opponents are careful they'll ensure the towntile is already gone by the time it gets back to your turn. So resign yourself to the fact that there may be some long hauls required to earn delivery points and chug away. Othertimes your delivery runs are all set, but you need to spend turns laying tiles in far flung non-useful places just to build up enough movement points to progress. So the game moves between carefully taken, somewhat interesting turns and simple filler turns, leading to a somewhat mixed impression. It's a decent game that falls perhaps uneasily between filler and meat.

I like the idea of a orthogonal tile-laying game with a pickup and deliver mechanic.  Too bad this is so tedious.  I think the part that kills it is slowly creeping your loco around the board.  This is almost as dull as "Zombies!!!"  But it rates higher because it has trains.

RATING: 5
This is a tile-laying pick-up-and-deliver game.  To me, that sounds like a brilliant idea, but I think this game fails in the execution.  There was really no incentive to play the towns where you can pick up and deliver goods, because if you play it that probably means the other players will get there first.  And, I understand why you'd want people to play tiles in order to move, but it just seemed like it took forever to do anything in this game.

Carcassone meets the Age of Steam? Looks to be be an interesting pick up and delivery make deliveries. 
Your turn options are to lay a tile extending track and banking steam. Or expending the banked steam to pick up goods at towns to deliver. Victory is accumulated by building rail loops between towns and delivering sets of cubes. A tactical game where you have to watch what your opponents are doing and mess with them by throwing in some hills in their paths.

Played with the expansion which gives more control to the runs.

I wanted a lighter version of Railroad Tycoon.

It's a neat game, is "Carcatrain". But I don't think it's a must have.

--- Summary ---
Carcassone-like train themed pick-up-and-deliver game. Hand of 3 tiles: train tracks in diff configurations. May either move train OR play tile - track or city tile (choose from 2 face up or 1 face down; come with 2 cubes; must have 2+ tracks btwn cities when first played). Some tracks may be played over others. All give you 1-2 steam (movement pts; may save up to 6). Movement costs 1-2 MP/tile. If attempt to move on curve, derailed if roll < your total movement.

Granted, I've only played this once, but while not particularly horrible, it didn't feel like it presented enough interesting choices.  There were a few opportunities for clever play, but most moves felt pretty generic.

Our die rolled a :d6-1: or a :d6-2: all but one of the rolls during the game, so making curves was a lost cause.  This wasn't as much frustrating as it was laughable.

I suppose I would play this again, but I'm not sure I will be willing to after play two or three.

Far too random, even ignoring the derailment die rolls (although they are a terrible idea). 

In a tile-placement game such as Carcassonne one is generally interested in multiple areas, which can be far apart, so there is usually something useful one can do with a given tile. Here, once the playing area has grown a bit there is little point in playing tiles far away from your train unless you can complete a circuit (which usually requires being set up) or you want to mess with someone. 

I suppose if you like take-that games then the latter might appeal, but I don't and it doesn't.

Purchased for $10 from Barnes and Noble. Sold later after a few plays. Pick up and deliver train game with some neat thought behind it. Couldn't get it to the table.

Tile-laying train game? Yeah... it's not something that I can see playing too often.

This is a total mess of a game.  There are too many exceptions to rules, too many things to remember outside of the general flow of the game, and not enough engaging things happening in the game to keep it interesting.  Top it off with a tile-laying mechanism that's more about playing them so that you don't benefit the players following you, and you wind up with an exercise in frustration, since you're rarely going to have a good play to make.  Oh, and it takes about four times as long as it should, which is never a good thing.

A refreshing break from economic based train games. Tile laying and delivery mechanics keep things at a light entry level to Euro gaming. Nice components from a now defunct company. Best played with the expansion which markedly improves things.

The love child of Carcassonne and Age of Steam.  Unfortunately, born with Downs Syndrome.  Not much fun at all.

I put sleeping with friends' wives and making people play Days of Steam into the same category: dreadful offenses against mankind.

Interesting game. You make steam to run your train by laying tiles. Then you move your train but it is so slow that you often have to lay more track before you complete a run. Visualizing the best runs is tough.

Tile-laying train game with pick-up and deliver.  It's not bad, not great, and plays very quickly.

Need at least one more play to know what to think about it. For now coal seems to me like weird idea added only to speed up the game. There is a potential to be really nice game - maybe it's 15 minutes to long

Second play was better. Still don't know if it has a lot of staying power, and will hit table very often.

My wife doesn't like this game. Traded away

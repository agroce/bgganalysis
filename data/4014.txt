I love this game, is it the perfect simulation, no.   But it is a great game and always fun to play.  The Pilot Experience mechanic is an added bonus for an old RPGer.  

Having an active group of supporters in the "Fight in the Skies" Society is fantastic.  This group supports a website, newsletter, and Mini-Cons.

Dawn Patrol is a fun game with some hidden strategy.  There is a lot of dice rolling and does involve a significant amount of luck but air combat in general required some luck as well.  Great society commaradery.

By far my favorite game to play, and have been playing for 20+ years.  The charts are a bit cumbersome to get through at first, but once you are used to the system its an easy game to play and the best part for me is its never the same twice.  Its the only game I know of that has its own society of players that has been together for over 30 years, and even puts out its own quarterly publication!!

My friends and I played hundreds of Dawn Patrol games back in the late 1990's.  A fun, straightforward, competitive game that has massive replay value thanks to players being able to have their own roster of pilots that can improve with experience.

**nostalgia rating would have been around an 8**

I wouldn't play this much today, but I loved it when younger and I still have my copy. It's a good game, but it's not a role playing game; it's more like Car Wars in the sky. Pretty good game and works as well as it did back then.

7 - Good game, usually willing to play.

This game was pretty fun.  I played it many years ago and I remember that it was pretty detailed.  It also had a role playing element as you survivied mission to mission.  In that case, it was similar to B-17.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The basic mechanics of flying/maneuvering, shooting/overheating, and damage/location is really good.  Everything else slows this game down.  I'm not a fan of historical games, so I would prefer balanced planes vs the historically accurate ones.

Time to be like Biggles and have a crack at the "Hun in the sun"! Simple movement and fire rules along with a detailed damage table AND a campaign system unlike any other make this a GREAT game if you're in the mood for light-hearted fun.

There are much better offerings out there for WWI aerial wargames. However, this did scratch an itch and added a RPG element--as your pilot survives, he gains advantages over rookie or less experienced pilots.

Just felt a little fiddly for my taste.  Bought this new in the mid-80's and sold it in the early 90's.  Rebought it on eBay from the USA in the mid-90's and ended up selling it again on eBay on 9 Dec 2007 for AU$43.85.  Blue Max is a much better and more fun game of WWI air combat in my opinion.

Cleaned up FITS rules, but questions remain:

1) Why can't loops be bigger than 8 MP?

2) Why would Climb, Dive, Straight, Turns L/R, Circle L/R Maneuvers (as depicted on the cards) ever be used in non-tailing situations?

3) Why would the 3 Reversal maneuver cards ever be selected by the target in tailing situations when they would ALWAYS be part of the card selection by the attacker? (Maybe make the attacker card sets be chosen at random?)

4) In addition to 'in-hex attacker flying level' situations, aren't nose up/down attitudes determined by gain/loss altitude moves in that turn?

5) The free turns are just too generous, way too easy to get into good shooting position, so it really just comes down to the Initiative rolls.

Given a +1 assuming the Advanced rules significantly add to the game.

Played many times with my cousins and friends back in the 80s. The plane tiles were a vast improvement over Avalon Hills Reichtovens War, though the flight movement was no better. Nostalgia and the TSR affiliation has kept it in my collection all these years despite the small likelihood it will ever get played again.

Not sure about this one - I seem to remember enjoying it back in the day, but now when I look at the rule book it just makes me cringe - seems like one of those games where you'd spend 3 times as much time looking up rules every turn than you spend actually playing the game.

RATING: 6
[5-10 plays] Decent offering for those who like the subject. The fact that there are better options in this genre takes nothing away from this game's innovation and cleverness for its day. I got this for Christmas in 1982 and Dan helped me with the rules in the first few games we played.

Most recent play was probably 1985.

RATING: 8
Have played for 30 years or so. High level of luck due to many die rolls. Good play results in more experienced pilots over time. But even the best will die, eventually. System bogs down with more than six players. For this purpose those from Wisconsin should probably count as two, due largely to their gregarious nature.

This is an old TSR game that attempted to combine role playing with a basic flight sim. By today's standard, the flight model is not as realistic as some games out there, but as a game it is fun. There are some rules to create pilot and observer characters. The characters gain bonuses in the game depending on the number of kills and/or missions they have flown. Overall, a fun game, but not a great simulation. (When it comes to flight board games, you have to draw this distinction! :) )

RATING: 8
One of the most under rated games of all time.  Great, but simple mechanics make this game a pleasure to play.  The more players, the better.  Perhaps a re-release with some fancy pieces could re-vitalize this classic.

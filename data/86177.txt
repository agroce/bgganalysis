Preliminary rating based on one six turn solo.  I'd rate a 6.5.  A light echo of other commentary:
- Great overview of an under-gamed millennia.  Would weight this aspect a score of 8.5.  As for everything else...
- Lighter that Pax Romana; probably too light; I know the history isn't there, and we don't really want it guessed in.  Still, the powers are disappointingly similar in almost all facets.  Not enough chrome.
- Paradoxically, oddly, the Lukelian pirates are ineffectual chrome on what I can fairly speculate is a rare corner case game situation to begin with.  How many times is western Anatolia going to get overrun by the Hittites, so that you are tracing trade routes back to ???? that the pirates are going to affect?  Talk about undue attention to a minutae effect... were the pirates thrown in just to get some "sea game" into the doings?  More a mechanism to smirk at then ever have to deal with.  
-  (limited exposure, but...) half the card events are yawners
- I had fun with it, playing it in 3-6 activation, 20-40 minute chunks.  But if I intended to sit down to the thing for 2-6 hours, I think I would find the uniformities in Powers' attributes and activities increasingly monotonous. 
- Minor thumbs down on the overall marker/art uniformity; some definite color COULD have been injected here; at least half the monument counters could have  been color coded, with different symbologies (Egyptian pyramids, temples (yeah, yeah, too late historically, but take some artistic ambience liberties here; Babylon Hanging Gardens or Ishtar Gate walls, etc).   
- Chariot technology "edge" is fleeting and over-rules laden.  Everyone catches up at the end of the turn, and most of your battles can involve city defenses.  Nice try at chrome, but boy, the window to use it in is only open a crack.
- Canaan; nice color for this sub-group, but by luck of the draw, if the card doesn't come up early -- and you have a player who wants to play it (NOT Hittites or Egyptians, eh?), I found my C cities were already occupied by Hitties and Egyptians, so the Canees were never allowed to take the field.
- Assyria; concur with some comments; they seem bound to be screwed by Mittani, Babylon, or both, a lot of the time.  I can't see how they will ever get to historical size unless the Babs completely ignore them, and they get to jump a Mittani player who is also getting shredded by a Hittite from the west.  Given the Hittites can make great, almost uncontested hay in Syria/Palestine and central Anatolia, they don't need to hit the Mittani, so this leaves the Mits free to wail on the Assy.  The game situation seems to put a permanent target on the Assyrians from at least two sides (if not 3, if the Hittites do well against the Mits).
- Egypt; where else do they have to go, but into Syria? 
- Luck of the draw; besides Elam, barbarian intrusions didn't happen enough to me; given the uniformity of everyone's activities otherwise, these outsiders are welcome in solo land for some chaos and color, but I think I got 2 Libyas, 3 elams, 1 Uartu, and 2 disqualified Canaan "stay on the bench, your cities are already taken" occurences in six full turns.
- Revolts; NOT enough.  The six mp away city revolts are a good mechanism.  But from my limited reading, there was an awful lot of internal throne-contestation strife in most of these powers.  Could have probably used some cards with "palace plot/rebellion -- lose your activation" friction cards, simulating the kings having to spend a years here and there to beat down pretenders to the throne (sons, grandsons, generals, et al) 
- Assassination cards do provide some respectably colorful disruption. 
- PS; nice map, Knut!

I will come back to it for the unusual era, but won't expect any big thrills.

Good game, interesting theme, not too heavy, not too light. Seems unbalanced in a five player game: Mitanni, Assyria and Babylon are having a hard time, while the Hittites and Egypt have room to expand. Should be some VP modifications for that. Could include more interesting and time specific events. Another problem is the VP count only at the end of the game. Sometimes a 20 hour campaign game comes down only to the last round...no matter how you did before.

My experience is with the 4 player game using the scenario for the first 1-4 turns.

Lots of chrome and flavor.  Card events can be significantly different in strength.

Downtime can be very bad.  Early turns can be solitaire for Babylon and Egypt.  I would recommend using a middle period scenario.

Eqypt has a great position.  Mitanni has a very bad position but awfully fun.  Babylon is playing solitaire for first 3 turns at the least.

Will play again for the flavor of the period and less for the competition.

Notes:

Thought we would jump in with Scenario #4, 4 players - 3 turns. Very strong thematic feel to the game. I enjoyed our first play, although we only managed to complete one turn in 5 hours. It has however peaked my interest in picking up a copy of Pax Romano. My one complaint is the size of the tokens, way too small ...

Each player represents one of the major Mesopotamian Bronze Age empires: Egypt, The Hittites, The Mitanni, Assyria, Babylonia. There are several “minor” kingdoms that come into play through the use of the Event Cards: Arzawa (Apasa, Milawata, Mallarima, Mira, Hindawa, Hapalla), Canaan (Hazor, Qatna, Meggido and Kadesh), and Elam (Susa). Each is trying to expand its economic reach, allowing them to build their empire to greater levels...and this will mean coming into inimical contact with each other. Gods play a major role, as do the great caravan centers of the age,bringing in luxury items from as far away as what would be Afghanistan. And then there are the peasants and slaves which who can be most useful (some times), as well as the great techno advantages in chariotry.
Compare with PAX ROMANA though not as complex
Also compare with THE GOD KINGS

Looking forward to playing Genesis, reading the rules, looks like a really streamlined Pax Romana, that I can teach even euro gamers. There are cards for events and the battle system is pretty simple and its a game that has a lot of emphasis on income generation to maintain your armies over the generations. (sort of like a 4x game, with a very short tech tree of JUST chariots!) Each turn is 50 years, so a lot can happen in each turn.

The rulebook is excellently done and very easy to read, took about 45 minutes and I am ready to setup the first introductory learning scenario. Bravo.

There is some fuss in the forums about the lack of a promised mounted map, I don't really care. I am going to pimp my copy a little more with some metal coins and thematic markers and introduce some conflict loving Euro gamers into the fold.

disappointing, the game is not bad, but it lacks chrome and historicity, units are the same, there are not national bonuses or differences, nor simply different cost for charriots, units o even monuments. this game is so generic that the sistem can be used for every period if you change the map you can make the 30 years war!

Length: depends on the scenario, but book 4 or 5 hours
Mechanics: action point
Decisions: really a lot
Opinion: I love multiplayer wargames, and this period of time is amazing.
Here you take the lead of a tribe of the Ancient Middle East to rule over the rest. You have to manage to conquer terrains, block opponents in their ways, build monuments, fight when needed...
Not much to say, you only have to take care of what you expect, the luck factor here is present, but is what you had on those days, and not something you should loose a game for.
How the turn is divided is nice, in your turn you have a major action, 2 minor and some building options. The money is scarce and you have to plan very well your movements, not many battles will occur, and you have to hit hard when and where you should. And keep in mind that your turn could not be when you expected, the tokens for the different tribes are in the bag, and they are coming out when they want :)

I must say this is one of the more impressive publishing's by GMT, at least lately. The map is really nice. I love the near satellite quality of the background. What really made me go wow are the 5, yes 5, player aid folders included in the box. Not only that but there are 2 different player aid folders and there are 5 of each one for a total of 10. The play books and rule books are beautifully colored. I mean all around high quality components. Very nice job Richard and GMT. 

Dropped rating from 8 to 7. The game system and mechanics are great. Play balance in the scenarios is questionable. In four games Egypt has won 3 and barely lost at the end the one game they didn't win. Would rather play Pax Romana and Successors.

RATING: 7
It's long, unbalanced (many of the scenarios are poorly designed, obviously unplaytested and unplayable for the poor Mitanni and Assyrians), fiddly (why does every single city have to roll for tribute individually?) and ruled by randomness (those Event cards!)......and yet I still enjoy it. The battle resolution is neat and well balanced in itself and I'm a sucker for the historical period. None of its shortcomings would prevent me from playing it when given the opportunity, although I'd avoid some of the scenarios. The full campaign 5 player game is probably where it's at, but the time required will probably limit opportunity for that.

Played our first game of Genesis at our 1st MN Friday. Thumbs up...four thumbs up (we played the 4p three turn scenario). We'll be pimping this one out (2x map, miniatures, bits, etc). AAR to follow. 

Similar to Pax Romana, but simpler. We had much fun playing; lite/less filling - but still meaty strategic choices, clean mechanics, full of twist & turns, big swings in fortune and a lot of opportunity to muck with your neighbor. What more do you want from a good saturday or friday night multiplayer wargame? 

Surprisingly, not as much flavor/chrome as I was hoping for, but, not so little as to take the soul out of the period modeled (Mr.Berg's not capable of that). 

Added bonus: rulebook actually decent. And, easy to teach/low barrier to entry. 

Smart design: ex: I really liked the tribute mechanic (demand tribute, but, the natives may revolt at the excessive taxation). And, like with Pax, the military operational model works very well. 

Tip of the hat to Mr.Berg, the Genesis Team and GMT. Now, here's hoping Berg gets his next can't-wait-for/must have ancients wargame published soon: Thunderbolt: The 2nd Punic War.

I was hoping for something elegant like Unhappy King Charles or Successors. Instead I got an archaic design and boring gameplay.

Great game, clear game manual and easy to learn. Only played once, 4 player scenario. This scenario starts on turn 5 and IMHO it's balanced towards Hitite and Egypt kingdoms. 

Anyway, the game system feels great, there are plenty of decissions to take and tons of great moments. Worst part of the game for us are the events. They can ruin a good strategy and are pretty devastitng sometimes

So today I met with some friends who love wargames and we played the 4th, scenario: Empires in Conflict.

Some of my frustrations with this game (and there were many) were with this scenario, some of them were with the game.

I tend to prefer Euro's games that self balance (from the game and not players).  I like some luck but not too much.

When we set up the scenario, for what was (for us) a six hour game, I immediately knew that I was going to lose.  I was the Mittani, the empire with the fewest resources and held the position between Egypt, Babylon and the Hittites.  I mean this literally - for any of the powers to engage with each other, they had to come through me.

The Hittite went straight for the throat (appropriate given the circumstances), the Babylonian graciously attacked the non player Assyrians (who became Egyptian allies bc of rules) and the Egyptians gobbled up a few of my cities and Babylonians ones and quite easily took the game.

The scenario balance was simply put awful - it was the worst I have ever seen in a board game.  One of the players emphasized this was the historical situation and that the Mittani lost.  So that's history.  I often read history.  I don't need games to be a clean simulation thereof.  I find that the places where history differs from a game to be a fun what if.

And those arguments - for luck, for wild swings (the Egyptian ended up controlling a major barbarian force too), for unbalanced set ups and lack of playtesting, all around was frustrating in the game.

If you like lots of luck, somewhat long rules and sitting down to a table knowing you have no chance - this is the game for you.  Blah!

This game gets high marks for components, interesting topic, and it's fairly easy to teach to new players.   The combat system is easier than it reads and there's quite a lot of strategy in choosing your shifts for losses.  If you're going to play the full campaign with four or five players then you need to be prepared for a few days of gaming as for some reason the turns don't play as quickly as you would think.  Genesis is one of those games where you look at your watch and see that you've been playing for four hours, having a good time, etc., then realize that you're only on turn 4 of a 10 turn game!

Looking very promising.  Really like Pax Romana, and maybe this will live up to its papa.

Solo training game not really worth the effort.  Rolled well early but faltered late, ending up three steps from the port, so lost with a morale victory.  But it did help me remember how much I liked the combat in the game.  Looking for the broader game experience for sure.

Got to play the begging of scenario three with three players.  Awesome!  I love the way the game flows, the aggressiveness expected, the card play to add wildness.  Some of the rules a bit loose, and we had to make so calls, but I really enjoy what the game is trying to do with the broad scale.

A few thoughts after three turns of play at five players: The game is very long, as each player has four activations per turn - with each activation segmented in one major move, two minor actions, one recruit action and card plays. At five players, we end up with 200 activations at the end of the campaign - Independent Kingdoms and barbarians activations notwithstanding - which is A LOT!

Once understood, the game flows easily, but I guess two full days will be necessary to play the campaign scenario to its conclusion.

However, I can see two potential problems to play balance:

- Having a good king has a major impact on your ability to move and conquer territory. When you play a short scenario, the way kings are drawn can completely throw the game out of balance. I suppose the campaign game is tested to bring a general balance, but this has a cost: Game length.

- With five players, the one who receive Assyria has no room to expand and finds himself very quickly in a major war against either Mitanni or Babylon... Egypt and Hatti do not have this problem! In our game, Mitanni was almost completely wiped out after two turns and I don't like the idea of a player being put out of the game while the others keep on playing...

May be a four players campaign game is where Genesis would be at its best...

This neat war game has a few things that make it really a good choice for a player like me:

1. The theme has a good historical background, and though there are some liberties which need to be taken when putting together a game like this, the historical side notes and overall feel of the game make the experience culturally worthy.

2. The game has good, relatively simple mechanisms. Though some of the minutia of specific maneuvers, such as when to retreat vs. regroup, usage of chariots and the rules surrounding some special abilities, the overall feel of the game is that one does not have to think too much for every combat. After a few clashes  one can figure out the small math or use the tables efficiently.

3. This game has tons of luck, particularly coming from the cards. Since preparing for every possible bad thing that could happen would be way too costly, one has to deal with a good degree of uncertainty about how things could pan out. In my maiden game I got taxed by the same God twice, got bad encounters with every possible neighboring barbarian tribe. There is also the die rolls, of course, which after a battle can cause your king to die prematurely. A live king (even a crummy one) is a great mobility and tactical advantage, and losing it after a battle is pretty costly.

Overall a pretty good game. Not something I would play with strong war gamers (I tend not to optimize or be overly aggressive) but one I would play casually if the chance to do so presents itself.

I think I actually prefer this to Pax Romana. Turn sequence is streamlined and I find it plays more smoothly. Maybe its the lack of naval movement/combat? Yes, there's less chrome compared to its bigger brother, and the sides are not as differentiated. But the game flows better and the theme still comes through quite nicely.

Wanted to like this. At first blush, its streamlining of the Pax Romana system makes Genesis more approachable and playable. However, it lacks much of the character and flavour of its predecessor. 

In Pax, battling barbarian invasions, allying neutrals, and coping with internal revolts give the game an engaging narrative while you're growing your empire. In Genesis, you just seige neutral cities for a few hours before you bump into your opponents. And there's no real differences between the powers. Ends up being a grindy and colourless experience that goes on and on.

I was so excited to have a Late Bronze Age strategy game, but my enthusiasm was quickly dampened. For a game with a truly epic scale, there's a lot of focus on small-scale combat tactics, huge random swings from a single die roll and an event card and a random leader, and micromanaging your peasants and slaves to get a little bit of construction done. The map has impressive historical detail, but also doesn't do a multiplayer game any favors: the Fertile Crescent is bordered by deserts and mountains, with no side routes for players to interact with each other except by killing the player in between them. And, of course, the Bronze Age was chock full of player elimination, meaning the Mitanni player will likely have 2+ hours of downtime as the night goes on.

Maybe I should just be playing Smallworld on this wonderful map instead.

Soloed a couple, each, of 2-player and 3-player games.   It's actually pretty fun and it gives me a good reason to use my stack tweezers.   The game rewards patience and planning.   Patience, because while you can generally conquer the non-player "barbarians" or independent kingdoms in your vicinity, pretty much on demand, you can't just launch an attack on another player.  It's too easy to build up impenetrable defenses in the numerous "choke point" cities that lie in your mutual contested zone.   You have to wait until another player or a "barbarian", such as the Sea Peoples, comes after your enemy.   When they are forced to begin moving some forces away from their border cities, then you can make your move.   You have to have forces in place ready to do this when the opportunity presents itself.  In the meantime, you build your monuments and your other infrastructure upgrades while waiting for your golden moment.   Typically, it only happens once in the game.   Note, as the Egyptian player it's easy to perceive your position as "isolated" (as the real Egyptians did, to their regret) and strip the home realm of troops and move them forward into Canaan only to get burned by a sudden appearance at the Nile Delta of the Sea Peoples who attack the home realm.   I believe something like this really happened in history across most of the eastern Mediterranean to help close out the Bronze Age around the 11th century BCE.

OK but was a little disappointed. Has a very complex combat system for a fairly simplistic game and that slows it down a lot. The victory conditions were also quite fluid with a 5 player gang up on the leader balance of power going on. But so much so that the first several turns of the game end up almost meaningless as VP are not cumulative.

I'm not convinced by this game.

What disturbs me :
- the balance of the game : Mitanni and Assyria seem condemned to fight to the death every time. Assyria in particular has no room for expansion.
- the combat system seems unnecesseraly complex especially given that there are a lot of combats (taking nearly every city seems to take at least 2 battles)
- not a lot to differenciate the powers
- a lot of chrome difficult to assimilate (ex. tribute => you have to roll to see if it revolts, then another roll to see if the revolt is immediately suppressed. it would have been easy to combine the two rolls into one. unnecesseraly complex again)

I need to try this again to see if the game is better than my first impression

RATING: 7
I may change my feelings on this one as I play it more.  First impressions are quite good, though it took us quite a while to understand it - mainly becasue I had a translation from the German and I'm not sure that the rules are that well written anyway.

This seems to be a thinking-filler.  I guess it would last maybe 45 mins once everyone knows the rules.  In that time, there are lots of decisions based around the three methods of scoring.    The artwork and theme is good (ok, I know it's essentially a pasted on theme).

It's the sort of game you can play at the end or start of the night whilst mulling over other things.  A warning though - this should be played quickly.  Slow play will kill it.  Its charm is in its speed and relative depth for its lightness.

A clever development on Rummy that gives you one or two more things (the historians, using pairs for in-game scoring) to think about.  The artwork is OK, though card quality in the Mayfair edition is poor.

RATING: 8.5
A card game with a scoring board.  Against expectations this is a little gem.  The cards have several uses.  Meld and create a monument or second of the same type.  Pair up to score symbols.  Add to your monument.  Laying and adding monuments gives your opponents opportunities to score, but at the same time increases your own monuments' value.  Nice cards.  Nice game.  Several routes to victory.  Recommended.

Two player variant is at least as good, with the lower of your two colours being your score.  Three player game plays quicker as a result of the removal of one set and several other cards.  One of the best games of 2008.

with Expansions No.2,3,4,5 and new 6. Expansion 1 as print & play tiles, now complete with all expansions. Nice Card play mechanics in Monuments. For laying out or expand ancient buildings, or to score points, or to buy a 4th action. And the timing must be also well estimated for writing up history an printing your victory points.

RATING: 5.5
Rating based on one game at BGG.CON '08.  It's basically a stock market game with some unintuitive mechanisms.  All three players made the mistake of building large buildings in the early game and failed to save cards for the crucial end game, so the game ended with a pathetic whimper.  It might be better with experienced players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Interesting game.  Mechanics are fairly tight, even if the theme is almost immaterial. (Some of the mechanics don't quite fit the theme, but that's fine.)  Worth playing.  A small amount of uncontrollable luck and turn order effects, but there are ways to compensate.

RATING: 9
Oddly enough, this game reminded me a bit of the card game "Canasta", where you're trying to lay down cards, but also keep cards of your own color hidden in your hand until late in the game.

A delicate balance between pumping up the value of cards and maintaining control of those cards makes this a pretty brilliantly designed game.  Rated 9 for its balance and the fact that it plays fast.

A fairly abstract set collecting card game nicely dressed up with a civ theme, attractive illustrations and a fairly complex scoring system.  It plays well and is an interesting enough for the playing time.  First impressions though are that there is a clear first/early player advantage, partly due to the immediate game-end condition, but also because of the prime early/mid game opportunities to score your historians.

RATING: 7
Players are trying to score points from the construction of ancient monuments.  Simple card game where players take three actions to draft and meld suits of monument cards.  Actions can also be taken to pick up some mid-game points for various symbols on melded cards.  Alternatively, a player can take a "historian" turn to remove cards from their opponent's melds, making them more valuable, but earning you some end game points also.  The game ends when the deck is empty, and melded monuments score according to how much "historical" stuff was written about them.  Very simple, but very clever, card game - some great ideas, very straightforward to teach, but offers good game play.  Very impressed.

A decent, but not great, set collection game where only 2 players can be working the same sets.  Set values go up by players taking history actions, which discards cards from the table in exchange for some points.   It's a pretty mechanical card game, but worth a few plays.

Perhaps somewhat unusually, unlike Tom, we liked Monuments.  Fundamentally it's a card game, with a board for tracking points as you go.  I thought playing with 2, where each player has two colors (but you do not have to alternate and hence keep track of alternating) was a good variation.  The highest 2nd score wins - so you can't leverage one color to have another lead.  Trying to keep both of your colors relatively even added another dimension.
To those who said 'it doesn't feel like you're building anything', my opponent suggested having two miniatures of each wonder;  the first builder gets a large one, and the second builder gets the smaller one.  I think I could play with that rather than the 'available monument' cards.

Its a card game (the board is just a scoring tool) and works quite well.  Nothing tremendously new, but is put together nicely and has some interesting decisions.  Reminded me of Ticket to Ride in play among other Euro-fare.  I was disappointed in the print quality.  I got the German version and it was still printed in China - dull matte box and board, the colours on the board don't match the cards so well (cards are lovely though).  Theme only just stretches to cover the action.

It has interesting gameplay, but in my few games so far, I thought too many monuments ended with just one or two cards, due to the historian actions, leaving too much to be decided by the tie-breaker. Also, the two-player rules are a bit annoying: you play with two colors and get only the lower score, which is necessary for the game to work, but the complex scoring system makes it extremely hard to count and balance your two scores.

This is a popular filler among our Wednesday night gamers at Wonko's.  I think it deserves a higher rating, though it is somewhat luck-based depending on the cards you draw.  There are some subtle strategies here; don't be caught at game time without taking your two historian turns.

An abstract card game, that might be fun if you don't take it too seriously. Some luck in which cards you have available and there are a few decisions that involve timing: 'historian' turns and getting all your cards down before game end. The scoring is too complex to properly evaluate so it's a case of going with the flow and enjoying the ride.

I was pleasantly surprised by this game, as it was very difficult to tell how this would play by reading the rules.  It ends up being a quick-playing game of timing, with a decent portion of luck in the cards.  The theme is, as expected, extremely thin, but the core mechanisms are simple, familiar, and easily understood.

The physical production is very poor - the box feels papery and flimsy and the cards are of very poor quality.  The whole thing could have been housed in a box a fraction of its size.

Monuments is very opaque initially, but underneath the complete bullshit theme there is some kind of stock game: try to get in on limited investments, boost the values of companies, then claim plurality in as many of those companies as possible just before the game end. It may be that the focus on hoarding cards and timing the last part is too strong and I'm not entirely sure I know a good move from a bad one after one game, but I know I'd like to play again and see.

I really liked this card drafting game that had a stock market piece to the game.  The game is mostly tactical but there still remains some elements of having to plan ahead, particularly as you near the end game and try to make sure you are first in a certain type of monument.  

This game is slowly going down in rating for me as I'm not really sure there is a variety of ways to really win.  So far, our different attempts have failed.

However, the expansion really seemed to spice up the game a bit...at least for now.  Adds a bit more to think about and encourages players to play sets earlier to gain special powers.

This game is so totally underrated. I had some trouble reading the rules as it was a little boring reading it. But once I was through, the game is actually pretty easy to explain, and it requires good tactics and strategies too! For a filler card game of about 30-40 minutes, this game is pretty thematic; you can build monuments all you want, but it is up to the opponents historian to write about your monuments. Timing is really important in this game as you want your monuments to be made more valuable by your opponent's historian. Would love to play more of this to see if it gets boring after a few games. But I think it's totally underrated!

Set collection game, where you have to balance the total amount of monument sets you collect and the time you choose to construct them: the more monuments you have, the more appealing it is for the other players to write about them. This way your monuments´ value raises, but on the other hand you are helping the other players getting history points. It´s all about balance & timing!

It is hard to devise a plan since the value of your buildings at the end depends on how many times your opponents create histories. Since they must create them or risk losing points, you can estimate and thus you must ensure to have the largest of each monument at the end in order to get the most points (timing of when you do things is important). The options to take another action or score points during your turn let you get rid of the cards you do not really need. There are just too many colors of cards (different monuments) and the game is very dry.

Há jogos que facilmente se repara que estão cotados muito acima daquilo que valem e outros em que a situação é o perfeito oposto. Pois bem, Monuments é um desses jogos que valem muito mais do que aparentam, pois a jogabilidade é excelente, o balanço também e até a contextualização (não sendo perfeita) é bastante interessante. É um jogo sobre as maravilhas arquitectónicas da antiguidade, onde o melhor jogador será aquele que descobrir qual o timing exacto para fazer história. Agora percebo o porquê da Mayfair lançar anualmente uma expansão para um jogo que está apagadinho no ranking BGG. Recomendo vivamente!

Monuments: Wonders of Antiquity -- 

Played once; three-player.

As we played, I felt like Monuments was [i]almost[/i] what it should be.  (But it may have been our level of play that was lacking.)  It seemed somehow too haphazard in regards to increasing the value of your own monuments.  The urgency of using all of your Historians before the end seemed to push us to make some less-than-optimal moves we would not have otherwise made.

However, I think strategies began to reveal themselves by the end, and we would all play differently next time.  

For example, I tended to wait to build a monument until I could build it with three cards, thinking that a Historian would take one, and I'd still have the possibility of a majority.  But of course, there are lots of Historians out there and in the early game they're likely to steal all but your last card (which can't be stolen).  Later in the game, adding multiple cards at once is unlikely to be entirely undone.

Also, we rarely used our cards for anything but building monuments.  Toward the end we began to use their symbols for extra actions, but only once did anyone use their symbols to score victory points!

This certainly deserves another play.  In fact, a second play will determine whether or not I want to own this.

The component quality leaves something to be desired.  The board surface has a porous quality (like plain paper), and the board itself was warped.  The cards are a touch thin and I wonder how much wear they'll be able to handle.

Nice incidental game.  Good to chat by.  I'm not a huge fan of straight drafting set collection games, but the stock like aspect and the history and rebuild timing aspects are entertaining. The game actually puts some pressure on you near the end and you really need to know how to focus your game.  

Despite the fact that much of the game is very tactical there is some real need for strategy to plan to restock your temples. Multiple plays reveal a proper sense of timing and strong planning rewards. 

One thing to note about the game: the sexual innuendo is endless here.

1 play, 4er

[b]--- Game Summary ---[/b]
The board has a score track around the edge, and several tracks in the center that track the values of all the (12) monuments. There's a deck of cards of these same monuments, numbered 1-9: players start with a hand of cards, and 3 are placed next to the draw deck. 

On your turn, take either a Monument turn (usually) or Historian turn. 
On a [u]Monument turn[/u], take 3 actions. The actions can be:
- take a card (face up or draw pile)
- build a monument: up to 2 people may work on any particular monument; the first person can play 2+ cards of that monument, while later players must play 3+ cards. These are played in a column in your display. Advance the value of the monument 1 step/card
- add to your existing monument: add 1+ cards to one of your monuments, advancing the monument value 1 step/card
- As a bonus free action, you can discard 2 cards with the same symbol showing at the top to either: score 1VP per similar symbol in your display, or take a 4th action
At the end of your turn, replenish the face up cards (if necessary).

On a [u]Historian turn[/u], take one card from the top of every other players' stacks, except may not take the last (bottom) card of column. These are removed from the game. Place one of your historian markers (start with 2-3/player, depending on player count) on the fame track, 1 space/card.

The game ends at the end of the turn when the draw deck runs out. For final scoring:
- for each monument: if only one person built it, it scores that player full value; if 2, then the player with more cards (if tied, its the first-played card -- card at the top of the column -- of higher value) scores 2/3 of the value, and the other player gets 1/3
- the top 3 historians score 9/6/3 points (for ties, the first-placed win)
- any unplayed historians are worth -12
Most VP wins!

[b]--- Comments ---[/b]
It's actually a pretty cool game, especially for the simplicity of the rules and the short play time -- one of those "super-fillers", maybe. It's got area-influence, sort of -- or maybe it's more like a stock game -- and a lot of timing: you need to build up your stock in the monuments you happen to draw, but not so much that you provide fodder for other players' historians. You need to take a historian turn yourself when there are a lot of cards to draw, reducing other people's positions in each monument while increasing the value of the historian you played. 

On the negative side, there are so many different monuments that some of the colors are hard to distinguish easily; fortunately, there are symbols as well. But a related problem is that it seemed a bit too difficult to get multiple cards of a type! But the game worked, so I guess it may not be a big problem after all. 

Pretty good game ... wouldn't mind trading for it, I guess!

Fairly easy to learn, almost deceptively simple.  It appears light, yet there are many colors to keep track of and some of the decisions are tricky, such as when to play your historian and even when to lay down your sets of cards.

Rated it higher (6 to 7) because it seems to be a very interesting game. It has solid and straighforward rules and it plays in about 45 minutes which is, for a game of this depthness, a very good achievement.
I still have some doubts about the balance of luck and strategy or the scorings of stories and monuments but for now it's a seven.

Quite interesting: a touch of Union Pacific about the drawing and playing of cards, with each player getting 3 chances during the game to increase ultimate monument values while reducing his opponent's influence in those monuments.

Monuments is a decent set-collection game that reminded me of many early Knizia designs (like Quandary, Members Only, etc.). This plays quickly and the tension between wanting to gather/play sets vs. taking a historian turn all while having to keep a close eye on the draw deck and end of game makes for a simple and enjoyable albeit unspectacular game.

In order to win the game, you not only have to build the monuments, you have to make sure that history will know them - and your fellow gamers will co-decide about it! And there are copyists, who will dispute the glory you've earned for your monuments...

The game shows monument cards with 12 types of ancient monuments like the Pyramids or the Colosseum (9 per type). The game is played in turns and usually you take a "monument turn," consisting of 3 actions allowing you to collect cards, to build monuments, and to expand your existing monuments. For example, it takes you one action per card to draw it either from the draw pile or the 3 faceup cards near it.

Neat card game where you put down melds of cards, but then players can steal 1 card from each meld on the table for points. So there's a nice conflict of wanting to put cards down to win majority for each colour, but hesitating to do so because you know your opponents will just steal cards.

Light set collecting game. You meld cards out of your hand to form sets that score on the board. Attractive game but the game play is just average.

Great game! So many things to combine. Easy to learn rules! My wife love to play it. Underrated game! Fast turns!

Have just played this 3 times, its Ok , effectively set collecting game with a 'how long do I wait 'til I play' twist. 2 of the family like it more than the other 2. I think we need play this a bit more to see if it grows on us or not.

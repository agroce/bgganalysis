Interesting, yet fairly light/simple, press-your-luck game.  Was interesting but not compelling with 2 players, and I would like to play with more players to see if this is a great filler game or just a decent filler game.

Played with 3 players, and oddly enough there are more strategic decisions to make, and yet the luck of the draw feels more impactful as well.  Still is a neat, simple game.

I ended up trading this away, as it felt too light for my taste.

I'm a sucker for Pirates and Steampunk so I practically picked this up for theme (and iello components) alone, but was thoroughly pleased when the game turned out to be fantastic! It's a great push your luck with a bit of competitive strategy involved in deck building. I only wish it played more than 4 players for our game nights that are usually 5 or 6!

i love this game : good choices to do (bet on long time with relics and rhum or short vision with pirates). Just a bit of aggressivness and interaction needed to block other people. Perfect for introducing adults into modern games and children into some relfexion (from 7 years old)

RATING: 5
Possibly the game gets better with repeated play and a deeper knowledge of the game but, on our first play at least, the game really fell flat. There are a number of cards that aren't self-explanatory and caused a lot of manual checking to see if there was any good answer for them (answer: no). This slowed the game down quite a bit and we had to house rules a smidgen. An FAQ for a few of the cards should probably be added to the last page of the manual.

The "push your luck" factor never really seemed to materialize. Because you've got (effectively) four chances to get something, and always do get at least one card, there's no real fear that you're going to "bust". And without that, the game just turns into any other card game of probabilities and set collection. For that, there are better games than this (I might suggest Guildhall, for example).

Another sweet little pirate game with colorful, amusing artwork. I like the feel of nuance to the set collection mechanics here, with the Object abilities and the negative points you can potential score for Relics if you haven't gathered enough. The parrot tiebreaker is neat, and the Boarding action adds in just enough conflict and treachery to enhance the theme. Components look good, and it's fun. This one is definitely a little meatier than you might think, and I'd recommend it if you're a fan of stuff like Archaeology: The Card Game but want a different them and a few new twists.

Op goed geluk gekocht, want niet de kans gekregen om het te proberen op de stand.
Plezierig spelletje waarbij je naar hoopjes buit kijkt en oordeelt of je dit wil of toch liever verder kijkt.  Je verzamelt relics, objecten, rum en piraten.
Piraten behalen in het beste geval een overwinning en verdwijnen daarna.
Veel geluk, want je kan geen LT strategie uitdenken.  
Niet voor kids, want toch wel wat Engelse tekst.  Met vertaling moet dit toch wel lukken.

My wife and I love this little gem by iello games. 
It's a fun sky pirate themed card drafting game for 2-4 players where you get to be a captain of a flying pirate ship trying to build a crew and collect treasure. The players take turns collecting cards from one of three separate face down loot piles in which you can pass up one for the other. The piles gain more cards when passed, either leaving precious treasure/ crew mates or junk for the next player or your next turn if they choose to skip as well. At certain points in the process of the game you can battle other players with your crew cards for money and glory (and an awesome parrot). With two players, it's an easy quick battle of luck, with a bit of strategy. But I imagine with four would be a lot more thought provoking and satisfying.
At the end of the game, tally up who had the most money, best crew, most treasure and rum and find out who is the best pirate of the sky!
Gameplay is quick and easy to learn. We love theme so much, and the art work is beautiful. You get a high quality game, without putting a dent in your wallet. This game will be in our collection for a long time, can't wait to introduce it to friends and family.

RATING: 7.5
There are a number of games where you draft from a central area, but can choose to go further to something else, by raising the value of the previous selection. Think "adding coins to the races you skip in Smallworld". This game takes that simple mechanism, and makes it the focus of the game. 

There are 3 face down stacks of cards, and you look at the first one, decide either to take it, or put it back add a card to it from the deck, and then look at the next. The cards you get mostly deal with set collection but you can also get secret objectives and pirates with which to fight your opponents. 

Very simple and pretty quick, his is a great filler game and would work with many ages and player types.

Le titre original de ce jeu était "Putes et flibustes", mais l'auteur (Théo Rivière, auteur de Shinobi Wat ah) s'est dit que ça ne serait pas très vendeur (en fait non, c'est son éditeur qui a dit ça). Donc on reste dans le thème de la piraterie. On y met une touche de fantastique en rajoutant des bateaux volants. Et on en fait un jeu plutôt très familial de Draft et de stop ou encore. Ne cherchez pas à avoir un contrôle absolu dans ce jeu. On est des pirates. Un pirate ne se contrôle pas.

Phrim's comment says it all: You get four kinds of cards that will give you "points for sets, straight points, special abilities, [and] combat power for 7 Wonders-ish fights with your neighbors." Nothing really is new, but the strategic possibilities are much greater than average for a 20-30 minute game.

Szuper kalózos témájú, zsákmányelosztós, interakciós, "press your luck" (kockáztatós), viszonylag gyors játék, amiben időnként a 7 csodából ismerős módon a szomszédos kalózkapitányokkal kell összemérni a haderőnket. Szép színes, családoknak megfelelő mennyiségű döntési lehetőséget biztosító játék. Tetszik ahogyan egyre nő a zsákmányok értéke, minél többször nem választják, így egyre vonzóbbá válik az idő előre haladtával. Ajánlott családi játék. (2017.12.27.)

The game uses some fairly simple, bland, yet functional mechanics for set collecting scoring, take that cards, and turn track. What makes it engaging however, is the exciting push-your-luck way of picking cards (it took me back to the Magic winston drafts we used to play - this is the same thing). The cute cartoon pirate artwork could be a selling point, but to be honest, I am getting burned out on this.

It is a clean game and a nice filler. In the end, it was fun to play.

Air Captains sail between flying islands, picking up shares of Loot, and sending crews to clash and plunder each other's ships. Collect Pirates, Relics, Rum, and various objects, and don't forget the Doubloons! Each round, choose a hidden share of Loot to improve your collection of goods and crew members. If you pass up a share, it might get better for the next player who chooses. But maybe what you need is waiting later on! Will you seek a set of relics, collect fine rum, or just go for the money? No matter what, make sure your crew can win the next Boarding action. The captain with the most Victory Points at the end will be hailed Pirate King!

RATING: 7
Sea of Clouds is as simple as, 'Do I want it?' and 'Am I willing to risk advantaging the next player to see if there's something better on offer?'  Yes or no, take it or leave it.

This game is gratifying, it's short, it's simple, you have options and you are always gaining; it is also not without its own level of light strategy, defined by how the cards are played but with a little bit of deduction and probability you can formulate plans and work a situation that almost always has the potential to be advantageous.  Unlike most card games, you aren't stuck with the cards in front of you, but sometimes it's better to bite that bullet and fuel your foes with more.

Will greed be your demise?

Actually quite enjoyed this one. There is not much here in terms of mechanics but it is a very simple streamlines system whereby you either take the share, adding it you your tableau, or pass on the share increasing its size. 

There is player interaction in the forms of a 7wonders style military phase every few rounds of game play, but all pirates are discarded after each showdown, thus preventing somebody from gaining to much of an upper hand. 

There is an interesting mix of positive and negative cards that can end up in the shares thus making for some interesting decisions.

Még a mai nagyon erősben is kivételesen szép darab. Gyönyörűek az illusztrációk és minden komponens jó minőségű.
A játékmenet egyfajta kártyadraftolás, némi közvetett push your luckkal fűszerezve. Mindenképpen egyedi, a legjobb ötlet tán az, hogy a hátlapjukról látod folyamatosan, hogy milyen kártyatípusok vannak a választható szettekben. Sajnos játék közben már úgy éreztem, hogy azért annyira jól nem működik a mechanika, mert nagyon nehezen tolerálható a szerencse szerepe. Ez súlyosbítva még némi direkt konfrontációval nekem már meg tudja keseríteni a játékot. Persze lerí róla, hogy nem kell, nem szabad komolyan venni, de azért egy kicsi agyalnivaló, ráhatás mindig kell nekem. Itt úgy éreztem, hogy extrém kevés múlik a döntéseken.

RATING: 5
A set collection game with the foundations of an interesting drafting mechanism. With the half-blind draft and the wildly different power levels of the cards the luck of the draw plays a huge role. I don't think that's unintended but it does feel a tad long and ultimately fairly forgettable because of that.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is a fun and addictive game with a tasty drafting mechanic that makes you want to keep playing after the game is over. I've played the game a ton at 2 players and the combat phases become even more interesting once you add a third player. I sleeved the cards using KMC perfect fit sleeves to make mash shuffling possible and to protect the cards, which were taking a beating from playing so much.

Bah! A point hoarding game... as if no one ever thought of that. Come on, there are other ways to choose a winner.

The game mechanics are not so new, but not so common either.

I don't really like this point hoarding game, there are much much better ones like Tokaido for example which is a much more pleasant game. Ticket to Ride is much more entertaining and older, and so on.

I don't see why this game has such a high rating on BGG, it is quite ordinary and brings nothing new to point hoarding games. It is highly overrated, should be around 5 rating.

The looks is only a superficial aspect of a game, and has nothing to do with the game itself, just the looks. It is pretty, but pretty does not mean a good game, same as ugly does not mean a bad game.

Sea of Clouds is one of my favorite new games. The game is simple to learn - simply add cards to your hand each turn - but there is a surprising amount of depth and strategy to it. Do you pass up the Siren's Song and risk your rival stocking up? Do you grab all the rum you can find or focus on building a strong crew of pirates?

The object of the game is to earn the most points, which is achieved through a variety of methods. You can earn points through collecting rum, relics, and treasures, by completing secret objectives, and more. At certain points during Sea of Clouds, you battle other players by comparing the strength of your pirate crew to theirs. Winner earns some loot and the game goes on. At the end of the game, you take inventory of the collection you've built up and count up your points - whoever has the most reigns supreme!

I love this game because it fits so well in various groups. My roommates love it because it plays fairly quickly and is easy to grasp, with whimsical artwork and a fun theme. I can take it to work for a long lunch with coworkers. We've played it at game night hosted by my FLGS. And this year, I'm looking forward to taking it home for Thanksgiving and Christmas. It's really the perfect game for any occasion and is a great pick for gamers new or experienced! #AllAboard

The game itself is probably fine but I couldn't enjoy it because of the images on the cards.  The box art is not representative of the card art.  The card art itself is very nice, but the choices made in depicting females and at least one race on the card art are distasteful at best.  (Female pirates, for instance, probably wouldn't find it very easy to work if they've only fastened one strap of their overalls or are wearing tube tops.  Yuck.)

RATING: 7.5
Card game with simple rules and (largely) set-collection scoring. However, the mix of hidden / exposed cards in each player's tableau hand and the neat pickup cards mechanism (look at a pile of cards, choose it or move onto the next at the expense of placing an additional card on it which we'll will be available to the next player) lifts it from the pack as a fun, short card game. It grows in suspense as the players' tableaux build and intentions become apparent while time and options run scarce.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.75
A light pick-cards-to-assemble-scoring-sets game, but cleverer than similar games in the same space.  The inclusion of the pirate phase adds some interaction, and several of the cards have interesting effects.  But if a pile or two gets filled with bad cards, the game gets significantly less interesting.

This game is very underrated. It has a very interesting draft mechanic where you must evaluate each pile in terms of its current value and future value if passed for another player. The three main paths - coins, relics and rum - seem to be well balanced. My biggest complaint is that the tie breaker rules seem arbitrary in terms of parrot proximity.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Cool mechanic  and the fact that pirates go away makes you think "should I focus on attacking other players or getting better loot?"

Parrot idea could be more fleshed out and interesting.  The game needs just one more element to be really compelling.

Light, fairly quick set collection game. Girlfriend likes it, so that probably helps it rank higher for me. The mechanic of taking cards to help yourself or adding cards to help your opponent makes for interesting choices.

RATING: 7.5
The Winston draft mechanism is interesting, and I love multi-set collection and cards of different values. The main problem is that since all the information is hidden, you are doing NOTHING on your opponents' turns, which is really a shame. If cards were open, you could at least react to what is going on, plan a little bit, and share the experience.

Gorgeous artwork. Pretty good components. Excellent graphic design.

Sea of clouds is a pretty simple... set collection game? Push your luck? Engine builder?
...Sea of clouds is a pretty light game where your success is mostly determined by how well you can read the table. And quite a bit by how lucky you get.

It's light, scores can be a bit surprising and it's good fun.

Okay game.  I could see this game suffering from downtime as players must sit and wait as each player in turn must review through each of the cards decks round after round although this won't be a problem if all players are familiar with the game.  The artwork is colorful and "pretty" but isn't really to my taste.  The gameplay is okay but this isn't something I need to play again.

Played the 2 player version (you play with a different side of the Central Board and around 20 fewer cards).* Rules were simple and easy to understand/explain/learn. Turns play quickly and involve risk and strategy. It's a fun game that doesn't involve a large time investment. Great for players of all ages!

Once the rules are understood by all players, gameplay will last roughly 15-30 mins. I recommend this game!

Sea of Clouds besticht zeurst einmal mit seiner tollen Optik. Hier hat iello mal wieder die richtigen Künstler gefunden, um ihr Spiel hübsch in Szene zu stellen. Hintr Sea of Clouds verbirgt sich aber auch ein tolles Spiel. Die Spieler sind Luftpiraten und als solche wollen sie natürlich Schätze sammeln, Rum trinken und eine Crew anheuern. Das passiert über einen Draft-Mechanismus, den MAgic Spieler vielleicht als Winston-Draft kennen. Mit diesen Karten sammelt man Siegpunkte. Aber Vorsicht: Nach jeder dritten Runde gibt es eine Enterphase und hier bekämpfen sich die Spieler untereinander. Der Sieger bekommt extra Gold oder kann Karten beim Gegner zerstören oder sogar klauen. Die Regeln von Sea of Clouds sind relativ einfach, es spielt sich flott und es macht Spaß. Das Card-Drafting ist gut umgesetzt und durch die Enterphasen kommt auch die Interaktion mit den anderen Spielern nicht zu kurz. Ich habe erst 1 Runde gespielt, dieshalb die etwas verhaltene Wertung, ggf ist hier nach mehreren Runden noch eine höhere Note drin.

RATING: 7
Sea of Clouds is a light game of set collection, drafting and pushing your luck. Making use of a pirate theme the artwork is vividly evocative of the subject matter and this game is one of those light pleasures that can jjust be enjoyed for what it is. 

The basic premise is that the players are travelling from island to island trying to uncover as much loot, rum and treasures as they can. At key points pirates must be pirates though and the players can try to board one another to steal and gain booty. This is done using something of a '7 Wonders' neighbours approach. For this reason I think the game shines at 3-4 (4 is best I think) players. 

There are better games out there designed for 2 players I think.  

This was a really nice surprise and something I'd add to the collection if a mate didn't have it.

This game combines the elements of points salad scoring that I like (relatively simply, unlike 7 Wonders scoring), has the drafting mechanism similar to Small World's drafting for aces, has beautiful components, a nice medium time length of about an hour. Scales relatively well, even at 2, Is simple enough to be a family game but deep enough to fun for gamer's and not just feel like a filler (has some real meat to it), has set collection in a way that I actually enjoy--I usually don't--has a confrontational portion/fighting/take-that (it's not really take-that in the sense of casting a spell that knocks someone back, this is more like 7 wonders fighting stuff), and this fighting is just the right amount of proportion to the rest of the game--a bonus, but not the main shift, and it has something I really like--where a deck contains multiple card backs which give a clue but not the details/specific of what the card will contain. Other games that have this are Eldritch Horror (in several ways) and Mansions of Madness to some extent. I love this mechanism. It's a light, drafting, euro with set collection--all things I usually don't like much but for whatever reason I think work WONDERFULLY in this game which avoids being clunky without being shallow as a resort. Highly recommended. FOR WHAT IT IS, I give it the highest rating. I think it achieves exactly what it's trying to achieve. A nice, streamlined, stripped-down combination of some really wonderful drafting and euro-card style games with a great pace.

Sea of Clouds is a light card game that utilizes a mechanism that I guess I'd describe as a blind draft.  There are three face-down cards (or piles of cards) on the table; during a player's turn, he looks at the first card(s) and either takes it, or puts it back, places another card face-down on top of it and then looks at the next card(s) and makes the same decision.  If the player doesn't want any of the piles, he takes the top card of the deck.  The cards themselves have four different backs, so while players don't know exactly what they might get, they have some idea.  Once taken, cards go face-up in your tableau, except for Rum cards which remain face-down.  The cards are fairly typical for this sort of game--points for sets, straight points, special abilities, combat power for 7 Wonders-ish fights with your neighbors.  This is a game that probably does what it sets out to do, but as a filler it didn't really stand out.

This was an interesting little game. I like the push your luck aspect. It gives interesting decisions as you push your luck and give those cards you are passing an extra card or $ to continue to make them more desirable. The battling is similar to 7 Wonders and that works fine, but there didn't seem to be enough "take that" cards to the battles. You battle, but then take the loot from the bank... hmmmph. I'm also a fan of set collection with some being openly visible and run being hidden. It plays fast and it made it hard to remember to move the round marker. The parrot tie breaker was a weak aspect of the game as well. It should have rotated, had more cards to make it switch hands, or something. I'd be happy playing this again.

RATING: 5
It functions, but I found the experience mellow.  Even for a light game, I was hoping for more depth to my choices.  It's inoffensive, but forgettable.

This is a straight forward implementation of Winston drafting -- I like that mechanic, but it has some issues that go unaddressed.  Namely, there is a lot of luck in what get dealt to the first slot (which is no risk to view) and there is a tendency for the first card to get picked a lot.  I think a small reward (e.g. 1 coin) added to the 3rd stack would encourage more digging, which drives more interesting choices.  I found myself feeling like I was not really in control of the game, and simply watching it unfold.  It might be better with 3 than with 4.

Wife and I have played this several times and really enjoy it.  A very good two player game.  The mechanic of being able to pass on a card, but in turn giving an extra card to your opponent is interesting.  The scoring is well done, so that there are several possible strategies to win.  This one is going to stay in the game night rotation for a while.

Very enjoyable set collection game with a fun drafting mechanic that is apparently called the 'Winston Draft', where you only get to see what's in each slot one at a time, and if you decide you don't want it and check the next slot, you have to add a new card in that slot to make it more valuable for the player after you to pick up.

I also like how it changes up that mechanic a few times in the game with the boarding events, and in general the card actions are pretty interesting, although I wish there was an expansion where I could get even more (I do have the promo coming my way, so there's that).

I don't think I'd ever turn down playing this game, it's a great filler. I only played it 2 player so far, and that was pretty fun, although I can see how it'd be even more fun with 3 and 4 players, since you get to compete against two crews that way.

Played with 3 players now, and was more enjoyable than 2, and boarding made more sense and more interesting.  Thinking 4 would be best.

This is a cute little pirate-themed set collection game. Each round, players take turns drafting cards. There are 3 pools, each starting with 1 face down card. You can look at the 1st pool and either take it (and end your turn), or pass on it: add the next card from the deck (if 3 cards already in pool, add a coin instead), and check pool #2 similarly. If you pass on pool #3, you get the top card of the deck. The cards are either:
- treasures, with some special power (eg strength modifier)
- rum, worth various amounts of VP (played face down in your pile)
- items, which come in various types; each type scores more with larger sets, and negative with very small sets
- crew, each with 1-4 strength and some reward on them
Every few rounds, there's a battle: the player with the highest sum of crew strength wins the rewards listed on each crew (usually coins). 

After 12(?) rounds, tally up all your VP (+ 1VP per 3 coins); most VP wins!

The game plays very quickly and is a nice little filler. The cards are colored differently (front and back) and you're allowed to look at the top several cards of the deck. That allows you to do a bit of planning, trying to decide whether you should gamble on an upcoming card, if it's the type you want, or settle for a pool available already. It played pretty well with two, and maybe would be even better with more?

A light little set collection game with a liberal dose of press-your-luck and take that for good measure. The 'sky pirates' theme suits this game perfectly, and the art style is colourful and beautiful. All the mechanics work really nicely together to evoke the theme and add a real sense of fun and tension to the game, where gunning for a certain type of card can net you big points, but neglecting another type of card can cost you dearly, especially during the three 'Boarding Actions' interspersed throughout the game. I like a good pirate game, and this one ticks all my boxes. Speaking of which, the box is nice and compact, which means this is a go-to travel game. Plays well at two, which is another bonus.

tl;dr: shit, it's a pirate game

I don't care for pirates. Games with pirates are usually not my thing. This game didn't look like a pirate game, but you're gathering bottles of rhum and teaming up pirates to get points. So it's a pirate game. Damn.
It's fine, but nothing really new. It doesn't take too long, and game flow is nicely streamlined. There are some nice choices to be made, but luck plays a substantial part in the outcome.
So all in all one of those fine filler games that I don't need to own.

Just finished it. I think, though the box says 2-4 players, it works better with more than 2. With two, the rounds are fairly short and if you didn't agree to maximize your looting, you really don't earn much. It's beautifully designed, the art is amazing and sometimes silly.

Full admission: This is not my kind of game. Drafting plus combo-building is common enough, but rarely does it capture my interest. I find myself simply not caring about the outcome, with each decision feeling less and less important. To that mixture (and I admit full bias here), Sea of Clouds adds a "take that" element that grinds the game down into an exercise I'd rather avoid. I need to play again, but my initial impression is not good.

If you're into drafting games, however, give this one a look. What I do like is the way the drafting is handled. There are three piles of cards. You can look at them in order, but if you pass on a pile, you have to add another card (face down) to the stack you skipped. In this way you are sweeting the pot for the players that come after you. It feels very much like you're playing a few simultaneous hands of [thing=12942]No Thanks[/thing] (a game I enjoy very much). I only wish the drafting mechanic was attached to a different game.

I will say this, the art is gorgeous. It has a watercolor feel to it, and keeps things light with a few visual jokes.

Starts off pleasant enough, then loses all credibility when you realize how unbalanced the hidden scoring cards are.

Halfway through our first game, we'd had a taste of fun and agreed to a second play immediately afterwards.  But after endgame scoring I tased a cop to close that loophole.  With a smile, I was dragged away, tried by a biased jury, and incarcerated.

I killed my cellmate two weeks later to avoid parole.  No regrets.

Luck of the draw to the nth degree.
Artwork is stunning though.

Awesome. I love the faces this games seems to make people make. You squint at the cards like, "I want this one, but these other two are awful." or "All of these are awful, but they have 10 doubloons on them" or " This isn't bad, I should take this... out of fear" This game uses Winston drafting (I think that's what it's called). That is, you look at a card pile, decide if that is one you want, or, you pass it up, but add another card to it that you don't get to see and look at the next card pile. Amazing game.

This is very similar to MtG Winston drafting with a set collection aspect and a mix of immediate, short-term and long-term effects. It's a good filler game that I'd happily play again.

Nagyon egyszerű, de valamiért szüttyögős játék, nem is fogott meg igazán, pedig nagyon szép a külcsín. Kár érte, mert a mechanika és a tablóépítés jó egyveleget alkot, de valami mégis hiányzik belőle.

I like this game. I do. It's slightly childish, and I shouldn't be saying that since I am only a 14 year old girl, but it's just doesn't take enough logical ability, nor is it particularly new or interesting. Would recommend if you have a son or a daughter you're hoping to introduce to gaming, or if you're a novice gamer.

This is a good filler, once you know roughly what the cards do it plays along pretty quickly, nothing excitingly new but it's smooth a bit of a mix of set collecting, take that, pirate and neat loot choosing decision making process.

RATING: 5.5
Competitive (Best 4P)

RFS:
-After few plays, getting relics seem to be the best strategy. Pirates are just bad.
-Cluttering of cards in play area means you may accidentally miss details
-Too light

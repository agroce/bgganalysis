Although playable and still fun, I would definitely go for the large edition.

When I first brought out this game and taught it, my non gaming friends were ho hum about it.  "It's just flicking dice down the board?"   After a few flicks and there's laughter, shouting, cursing and just a lot of fun going around.

Essen 2010 - Dexterity game with an underlying strategy (or perhaps more accurately described as risk assessment).  Similarities to shuffleboard, but needs a much smaller table.

RATING: 6
Nice. Slightly too short and not too strategic, of course.

RATING: 7
Gioco da pub, di abilità e fortuna, perfetto per divertirsi e/o per prendere in giro l'avversario. Si fanno ruzzolare i dadi con una "schicchera" giù per i gradini, sperando che si fermino esattamente dove si vorrebbe. Il che raramente avviene, com'è giusto che sia.

Comment souvent avec les tailles réduites de jeu, il est vraiment moins agréable à jouer que son ainé (dés trop petits qui roulent moins, "marches" moins épaisses). Quitte à choisir, le grand modèle est très largement préférable.

This is great as a filler. The first dexterity game I came to own, I would have got hold of the full-size version if I could have found it anywhere. Very accessible for friends, family, anyone.

Dexterity game with dice and the essentially shuffleboard. Pretty good stuff for what it is, nice piece made of wood. A little pricey, but it is wood. Fun!

RATING: 7
A fun ans fast game that actual requires some skill. It's just a shame they don't make a pretty enough copy that readily available that my wife would be happy to own. I guess I'll have to build my own one day.

November 2016--Looking forward to trying this . . . should be a nice light dexterity game alongside Bandu.

Update 2017: Yep, so much fun! Only Crokinole would be better.

Very fun filler or starter game as easy to get into, you get to roll dice, and it plays quickly.  Good for newbs as well.

The two player game is not as much fun as the sublime Cube Quest. It's substantially more entertaining with more players.

Fun, pub style game that get's better the more you play it.  I should have got the larger version though...

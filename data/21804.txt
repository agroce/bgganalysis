RATING: N/A
I have several decks, of course :-)

My favourite is Misery Casino where you try to avoid collecting points. If the card you play can take cards, you have to. If play a card that could take cards, the other players can decide which cards to take, if there are alternatives.

I had a lot of fun with Spades, Hearts, Rummy, and others during high school and undergrad, so I have a soft spot in my heart for these.  My wife has no use for them, and I'll agree I'd rather play Jambo, RftG, Glory to Rome, Blue Moon, etc. by roughly a hundred million.

Still, spades is actually a decent game, strictly speaking.

RATING: N/A
1 play of a BGG user's climbing game, Escalation. Unfortunately, not very impressed; the scoring seems off.

1 play of Terziglio, though we've played it once before. Trick-taking without trump forces a very different set of evaluations. Pretty fun!

1 play of Manni, a simple Icelandic trick-taking game. Seems like it could go for quite a while, so we called the game. Scores: 1, 0, -1. (The goal of the game is to score 10 points!)

2 plays of David Parlett's Trigami, which went over really well. A cross between three-handed Hearts and Sticheln.

1 play of David Parlett's Gooseberry Fool, a trick-taking game which is all about being the monkey in the middle. I have absolutely no idea of how to end up in that position for the endgame, though.

4 plays of Sift Smoke, a nifty and simple card game from the turn of the century. Quick, fun and different -- will probably get a lot of play.

Other games (play numbers above not updated):

Stop the Bus, a silly variant on 31. Quite fun.

Fan-Tan, quick and somewhat strategic.

Kings in the Corner, a game I used to play with my grandma. She called it "Four Kings" so that's what we call it.

A standard deck of cards is the most important and versatile gaming implement known.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Standard card games I know and like enough to list here:
- [url=http://www.pagat.com/boston/spades.html#four][b]Spades[/b][/url] [8] A somewhat basic but fun partnership game.  The penalty for going under [i]or over[/i] your bid makes the game fairly tense and a lot of fun.  This is my preferred four-player card game if learning/playing Tichu isn't an option, and my favorite standard-deck card game. (Click the name for the rules I use.)
- [url=http://www.pagat.com/exact/ohhell.html][b]Up and Down the River[/b][/url] [8] A lot of fun when played with the right rules -- including simultaneous bidding and holding the singleton on the forehead. I'm not sure which of the many scoring variants I prefer, but thankfully many are acceptable.
- [url=http://www.pagat.com/adders/crib6.html][b]Cribbage[/b][/url] [7] A casual card game with a bit of strategy. It's quick and doesn't require too much thought, so it's good for a casual game. The lack of any real tension is a drawback. 
- [url=http://www.pagat.com/exact/99.html#three][b]Ninety-Nine[/b][/url] [9] A very good game for three. The bidding mechanism is very interesting, often leading to very difficult decisions on what to discard, what to keep, and how to play the hand. With the ability to 'reveal' and/or 'declare' it seems that some games could be over [i]very[/i] quickly, but this shouldn't be a problem given that one can play best of X, or best score after 9 rounds (thematic).
- [url=http://www.pagat.com/euchre/euchre.html][b]Euchre[/b][/url] [6] A simple and fun game, but spades has more to it and plays with four.
- [b]Hearts[/b] [5] Not my favorite of the traditional card games for four. Distributing point cards to people is not terribly interesting to me, though shooting the moon is pretty fun -- when it works.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

President, Scopone, Hearts, Oh Hell, Karma, Cribbage, Bullshit... so many great games in such a small package

I play lots of traditional card games, especially with non-gamers as it is often easier to get them play these than show them a really funky, new kinds of cards with intimidating amount of special rules and weird graphics. Card games I mostly play are (names in finnish): Ristiseiska, Neekeri, Pokeri, Blackjack, Laisto-Casino, Seiska, Tikkipokeri, Arabia, Paskahousu/Valepaska

I've never really been a big fan of traditional card games. There are just so many games that I enjoy playing so much more than to waste my time on them.

RATING: 5
I will usually use this to log games played of [b]3 to 13[/b] which is an OK game, similar to Rummy.  Each hand you get more cards and the goal is to get stuck with as few points as possible.  I just give Traditional Card Games a 5 since there are some good games and some bad, and some inbetween, so it just gets an average rating.

Update:  I noticed that 3 to 13 now has its own BGG entry, so I'll probably be logging all future plays under that item.

Loved card games as a kid.  Now I can't hardly remember the rules of most that I once played.

I do play the occasional game of Freecell to pass the time.

Used to have a bunch of decks.  Sold some novelty decks on commission at a game store, donated a couple to a nursing home, donated another to a café I game at.  Might have thrown some away as well.  I still have four decks (two Bicycle, a "Crooked" deck, and a Batman deck).

To date I have played no card games that are not in the database, and don't expect that to change anytime soon, so any rating here would be redundant.

A quick comment though: I am a big fan of card games, and many of my favourites can easily be played with a traditional deck of cards, or a slightly modified traditional deck of cards: Spades, Doppelkopf, and Canasta all fall into this, and honestly, Tichu would be playable with a normal deck in a pinch as well.

Card games are often repetitious, but they still have a special "fun" spark for me, and I love playing them.

A deck of cards is the greatest game implement ever created (dice being a close second).

Some of the greatest games in the world like [gameid=2181] and [gameid=1115] are used with a traditional card deck.  A deck of cards is also used for great children games like [gameid=10799] and [gameid=7682], and great casino games like [gameid=27443] and [gameid=10816].  

A deck of cards is so versatile and portable, and is a must for any household.

My ratings for card games are in their own entries.

My favorite card games are [gameid=1115], [gameid=2181], [gameid=15878] games ([gameid=25574] being my favorite), [gameid=4583], [gameid=2398], and [gameid=6887].

[geeklist=171804][/geeklist]

Recommended books I own:
[gameid=20993] - Quite comprehensive, read this content free under the "Game Rules" section of the US Playing Card Company's webpage: http://www.usplayingcard.com 
[gameid=15678] - Third Revised edition (Philip D. Morehead). The section on card games is very useful, especially the contents pages which categorizes the games by suitability for adults/children and by number of players. This book and a deck of playing cards is all you need to take along on a vacation! 
[gameid=18529] - The most comprehensive book in English with standard card games. 
[gameid=20893] - Great collection of rules for card games, well organized. 
[gameid=20823] - One of the most comprehensive and highly produced game compendiums - a pleasure even just to browse, and has an excellent section on popular card games. 
[gameid=7408] - Excellent selection of 35 basic card games, good variety including the classics, clearly explained, very good resource.

Several specialized decks or games owned:
[gameid=2398] - Classic card game where card combinations win points.  2/3 luck, 1/3 skill.  Requires decision making for selecting cards for the crib, and which order to play the cards in hand.  Kids enjoy finding the point scoring combinations, and the imbalance of each game turn makes it interesting.
[gameid=19975] - A trick-taking game that is a variation of Oh Hell for 2-4 players, where players select one of two cards to build their hand before bidding and playing.
[gameid=6901] - Fun social game, especially for tournaments. I prefer the more challenging [gameid=13123]. Consider [gameid=20240] for two players. 
[gameid=7189] - Basically a standard card deck with point scores marked on the cards, but some neat artwork.
[gameid=15049] - The national card game of Hungary, a popular three player trick-taking game played with a 32 pack of cards known as Magyar Kartya (Hungarian cards), or the William Tell deck.  Also playable with this deck are the games Makao (crazy eights variant), Snapszli (Schnapsen variant), and Zsir (Czech Sedma variant).

Specialized editions of traditional card games for children owned:
[gameid=11017] - Young kids love this card classic.
[gameid=6887] - Have a simplified deck with a variant for kids.
[gameid=15878] - Have a simplified deck with a variant for kids.
[gameid=17003] - The classic slapping card game for kids.
[gameid=15700] - Donkey, a variant of Old Maid
[gameid=10799] - Young kids love this card classic.
[gameid=7682] - Young kids love it.  Essentially the same as [gameid=11670] - Quartet = Happy Families = Authors.  
[gameid=20460] - a Go Fish/Authors type game, themed on pictures from Hans de Beer's Little Polar Bear books.

I own them all! Gets its rating for portability, price, accessibility, and flexibility. No theme, too many pure chance games, and often requiring chips, scorepads, etc. are drawbacks. Like dominoes, this is a tough one to rate. If you don't have a deck, get a deck. You will get a ton of usage out of it with only a few different games. But there are many games I would rather play than anything that can be played with a deck of cards.

Hundreds of years of hands and minds have sculpted one of the most perfect human-scale artifacts—yeah, it's right up there with knapped flint and the electric guitar.

Playing with cards is an absolute feast for the senses, a breaking of bread with loved ones to feed the soul even as it nourishes the intellect.

All the "desert island game" discussions are rendered moot by this palm-sized wonder—the issue was solved long ago.

[b]Cribbage[/b] is my favourite standard-deck game. At some point I'd like to get myself a nice board.

[b]-7-[/b]
[b]Big Two[/b] and [b]Hearts[/b] are both very good games and are good options for 3 players - but the ideal for each is 4 players, and with that number I'll choose [b]Tichu[/b] almost every time.

[b]-6-[/b]
[b]Euchre[/b] is a good filler, mostly auto-pilot. [b]Spades[/b] is an okay game but it lacks a real hook. 

[b]Gin Rummy[/b] is a decent game with simple rules and scales well. It's nothing great, but it is vastly superior to the branded knock-offs [b]Rummikub[/b] (SDJ winner!?!) and [b]Phase 10[/b].

RATING: 6
Well The easiest and cheapest way to gather around a table with some friends and play some games.
I give a 7 for all card games without any hesitation.
I give it Light medium. Altthough I play it as a medium game because I tend to count the cards. and try to remember where they came from in particular cases. But there are some who play it based on that they feel it is the right card.(Lightest way possible)
rules are fairly simply so you can focus on what you have to do. Actions are simple as well. taking the right action can sometimes be a bit of a brain burner.. games are quick and after a game it is common to discuss where the game was lost or what card should be played at a certain point.

Update : well there are too many games around to stick with cardgames. i will allways play but only if there is no other option. Hence rating only 6.

My rating is a baseline for most traditional cards games I expect to be playing. Presumably, I'd turn down anything I consider a 3 or less, occasionally get roped into playing a 4, and counterbalance all that with the few games I rate 7+. Basically, the 6 is for the likes of Hearts or Gin Rummy, which I'd recommend over most such games and settle for if I can't sell Tichu.

I've been looking at Pagat's excellent classification system, particularly by [url=https://www.pagat.com/class/#mechanism]mechanical category[/url]. In general, each of the broad categories has one major subcategory (e.g., Hand Comparison ==> Vying) represented by one major game with lots of variants (e.g., Vying ==> Poker). Below are the top half of all ranked options on BGG for each player count within these categories (with some lower ranked game tossed in to fill out some categories):

[b]Card Exchange (Rummy):[/b] Canasta for 4 players, Gin Rummy for 2 players. I played the latter quite a bit growing up and wouldn't mind playing it (or my brother's favorite 500 Rummy) today. That said, they're both is outranked (and outclassed) by Mystery Rummy, a commercial version for 2 players. Going further afield, there's Mahjong, the top-ranked Rummy game, though that's definitely not a "traditional card game."

[b]Hand Comparison (Vying):[/b] Head-to-Head Poker for 2 (Knizia!), Mus for 4 (Encaje variant for 3), Poker for 5 or 6

[b]Patience (Solitaire):[/b] Solitaire for 1 = super boring. I've realized I'm not that into solitaire games of any type, and this is among the least interesting. However, competitive versions like Spit or Speed are quite exciting! Nertz can involve even more players.

[b]Other:[/b] Mate or Dueling Nobles for 2 players, Barbu for 4 players, Mafia/Werewolf for 6+ players. Commercial games (Magic, The Resistance) make most of these pale in comparison, and Barbu is basically a trick-taking game most of the time (see below). Mate's interesting though...

The big exception is the [b]Outplay[/b] category, which includes its own array of important subcategories:

[i]Climbing:[/i] Tichu or Zheng Fen for 4 players. Haggis is a commercial version for 2 or 3 players. These are probably my favorite traditional card games at this time, especially because they seem to combine so many of the other mechanisms outlined here.

[i]Matching:[/i] Cribbage for 2 players, Eleusis for 6 or more, CrossCribb for anything in between. I can't say I find Cribbage all that interesting, so this category is probably not for me.

[i]Fishing:[/i] Casino for 2 players, Go Stop (flower cards) for 3 players, Scopa or Lamarckian Poker for 4 players. Casino got old quickly, and we'll be trying Go Stop soon.

[i]Beating:[/i] Svoyi Koziri for 2 players, Durak for 4 players, I Doubt It! for 5 or 6

[i]War:[/i] Egyptian Ratscrew is the only game worth considering here!

The [i]Trick-Taking[/i] subcategory of the Outplay category is a world unto itself, with about as many varieties out there as all the other games combined, at least among games ranked here on BGG. The top plain trick-taking games, sorted by group, are listed below with player counts in parentheses:

* Boston: Bridge (4), Spades (4), Bridgette (2)
* Trump: Euchre/500 (4), Watten (2-4), Ecarte (2)
* Exact Bidding: 99 (2-3), Oh Hell (4-7)
* All Fours: Pitch (2-4)
* Put: Truco (2/4/6), Le Truc (2/4)
* Other: Piquet (2), Preference (3), Whist (4)

There are also point trick games. Almost all of the groups here (L'Hombre, Manille, etc.) don't have a representative game in the top half of games ranked--or ranked at all--here on BGG, but there's one quite enormous exception: the Ace-Ten group. These seem notably light on 2-player options; even the games that allow play for two are not necessarily that great at that number.

* Schapfkopf subgroup: Skat (3), Doppelkopf (4), Schafkopf (4), Sheepshead (3-6)
* Marriage subgroup: Pinochle (3-4), Schnapsen, Bezique (2)
* Jass subgroup: Belote (4), Klaverjassen (4), Jass (3-4), Klabberjass (2)
* Other: Briscola (2-4)

Finally, the point trick games do have one more game of note that's not in the Ace-Ten group: Hearts, which can be played with 3 or 4 players. It's a "reverse" point trick game that I played the shit out of in college.

I find that traditional card games don't get the respect and attention they deserve nowadays. Gaming should be a social experience, and sitting down at a table with a stranger in order to play a good old card game is something everybody should do, especially partnership games! 

The connections and interactions made thanks to- and through games should be given more attention, and I feel that traditional card games have a huge unseen potential in that regard. 

I know that me encouraging old (and sometimes terrible) card games might seem counter-intuitive on this platform, but I stand by every word.

If there's nothing else available, or when playing with non-gamers, works as a filler as long as the playing time is somewhat predictable. I prefer bidding games: especially Pidro is quite fun with a competitive group. Huutopussi isn't bad either but with three players it can take forever.

Ones I remember playing include at least:
- ristiseiska and maija, both at home and with friends
- kasino, blackjack, and all kinds of poker with my elementary school buddies
- all kinds of solitaire
- gin rummy with mom
- canasta with the neighbors
- shanghai with another neighbor

RATING: 8
A catch all for recording plays of traditional card games not listed at BGG. In general, I would usually be willing to play most traditional, standard deck card games at least once.

Some games I'm interested in trying (bolded names hold the most interest): 500, Bezique, Bridgette, Briscola, California Jack, Chwech, Doppelkopf, Shafkopf, Dou Di Zhu, Gou Ji, Dueling Nobles, Durak, Jass, [b]Jo-Jotte, Penchant[/b], Lamarkian Poker, Panguingue, Pinochle, Poke, Pond, Le Truc, Truco, Tarock, Zetema, [b]Zwickern[/b], Zsírozás, Zheng Fen, Tien Len, Russian Bank, Kryt'-navalivat', Huojian (6 players, partnership, Zheng Shangyou). 

[b]Twenty - 4[/b]
[i][url=http://www.pagat.com/invented/twenty.html]Twenty[/url] is an adding game listed in the invented game section at Pagat's. I was intrigued to try a game that bills itself as "skillful" and that belongs to a family of games with extremely few relatives: there's Cribbage, and the drinking game called 99, and precious little else in the genre. Sadly, there was almost nothing skillful about the game at all. There are few decision, none are agonizing, almost all are automatic. It might be okay as a pastime with young children, but I doubt I'd be interested in playing it even then. Disappointing.[/i]

[b]Elemental - 7.5[/b]
[i][url=http://home.netyp.com/dragon/elemental/help.htm]Elemental[/url] is a solitaire game by Adrian Morgan in which the aim is to remove all 52 cards from a layout in blocks of four, all of different suits. It's an interesting puzzle. You have several possible types of manipulation (slides, spares, spills,...), but may only take 3 manipulation actions before you'll have to remove some cards from the tableau. You can remove 4 cards (all with different suits) from the corners of several possible rectangular formations, or pull spares (to reset your manipulations and set up future ones) from the center of crosses. Choosing which to do when looks like it makes a difference. Pretty good for a solitaire game.[/i]

[b]Mitaines - 6[/b]
[i][url=http://www.pagat.com/invented/twenty.html]Mitaines[/url] is an unusual fishing game from Quebec. I'm not sure what I think of it yet. It seemed to have more potential on paper than in practice. I thought there would be more jockeying type plays - setting up a lower combo to lure your opponent into an escalation of series of combos. But whether or not that happens is highly dependent on which small subset of cards each of you has been dealt. In some cases, neither of you may be able to setup any combos at all. There are too many unknowns, and too much dependency on which cards come up when to have any sort of strategy. I think you need to have some unknowns (otherwise the game would be solveable), but I think you need to have more control over what possibilities and play options you'd like to exercise over the course of one deal. In other words, I think it would be better if the hand sizes were larger, and perhaps the deck shortened by removing some of the ranks. I'm also not sure what I think of the scoring related to Jacks - it seems overly rewarding of luck rather than skill. I also found having the Jacks ranking above Aces was not necessary. There's potential here, I just don't think it's been fully realized as yet.[/i]

[b]Cow[/b] - 4.5
An odd, no trump, no follow suit, no nothing trick-taking game. Not good. A 5 at most. Maybe 4. [i](Part of Hoyle Card Games 2010)[/i]

[b]Guan[/b] - 6
A two player climbing card that's available as an app for the iPhone. Played one hand and that was enough to tell that the game wasn't worth playing in comparison to Haggis. Not tense. Pretty easy to empty hand. Hands empty quickly. Scoring system is flawed - worst case longest game is 120 hands! Can't understand why they would let you attach a stranded singleton to a bomb - it's better to make singletons harder to get rid of, not easier.

I love standard deck playing card games and have played many over the years.  There is certainly a lot of fun to be had for a very small outlay in cash.  However, as I've acquired more games, the time I spend playing these traditional games has decreased significantly.  I am pretty sure this is a bad thing.  Fortunately, the relatively recent addition of Robin to our game group has seen us playing more of these type games.  Perhaps in the next year, this will be a trend that will continue, and we'll continue to get back to our roots, so to speak.Added 12/14/06

After my travel card game craze, i found that i like playing trick taking games a lot, with decks similar to traditional playing decks such as Haggis and Tichu. 

Hence i thought it would be more economical to get more out of a traditional deck. I bought the Penguin Book , i had decks laying around already. 

Now i only need to learn the games from the book.

Umtali - http://wjm.0catch.com/umtali.html (via Pagat.com)
A 2 player rummy variant designed to be played on the small tables of the Beira (Mozambique) to Salisbury (Rhodesia) railway in the early 1900s. The name of the game comes from the border town, Umtali (now Mutare).

The game is fast playing and social in nature as players must play the cards from their hands and but that is hard to track so cheating is quite possible. Cards can be played to 3 card melds of groups and runs or as single cards off an existing single card or meld, whether amongst your cards or your opponents.  Jacks are always solo cards, and KQ can be played as a marriage for double points. Once a player goes out the other player gets one turn to go out or forfeits his remaining hand to his opponent. Scores are then calculated with 10-K at 5 points each and A-9 at 1 point each.

As you can probably guess the forced play nature strips much of the strategy out of the game and makes the draw important but there are still some minor decision points, especially surrounding the draw and discard. The game is best of 3 sets of games with 4 hands in each game based on total score. I enjoyed playing it as an artifact of history but probably wouldn't recommend it to anyone but a cardgame aficionado. 7

I'm really not sure what it is, but I've never cared for these games.  I like abstracts, and I'm OK with randomness, and I like cards as a game device.  But these games (gin, rummy, pitch, hearts, spades, etc.) always felt like something thrown together for when there wasn't something better to do.

A deck of cards used to be my constant companion.  I knew dozens of games and had a bunch of fellow card-playing friends, so we played everywhere.  One of the few sad things about stumbling on this much huger world of games is how far the role of traditional card games has dropped in my life.  I met my wife playing Pinochle and founded many of my oldest friendships in Canasta...  I don't know, I guess I'm just a little nostalgic for those simpler times, even though I love so many of my newer games so much more now.  Cards will have the last laugh though, when many of the games we know and love now are long forgotten, playing cards will still be here.

Obviously this covers a wide spectrum of individual games, but I enjoy cards and card games.  I like that they're compact, of basic design, and yet so extremely versatile that there's truly countless games played with the humble deck of 52 cards (sometimes more, sometimes less).  

I also like that there are so many regional games played and enjoyed by everyone around the world.  Some people may think of one particular game when someone mentions "card game", and yet maybe 100 miles away no one has ever heard of that game.

If you have a deck of cards, you'll never run out of games to play.

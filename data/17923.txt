RATING: 6
No one ever wants to play this with me *pouts* 

So I'm a history nerd with an extremely good memory for dates. What's the problem? :)

RATING: 8
The game is good, but the dates are harder to place in this one. Try Erfindungen first.

My favorite of the Anno Domini boxes. The cards are diverse and many really make you laugh. It's always in our mix.

Trivia games are not games, they are [url=http://www.human-memory.net/types_declarative.html]non-interactive skill[/url]  contests, played on an uneven field, which are fun for equally matched players/teams, but usually devolve into which team gets lobbed more softball questions in their weakest category, à la Trival Pursuit. Great for finding the Rain Man in your social group.

This is a wunderful mix of knowledge and bluff

RATING: 7
Probably the best set. The cards are interesting and fun and even the biggest history expert will not know a lot of them.

RATING: 7
Sort events you usually don't know a thing about by years. The best bluffer should win. On the negative side, play order can decide the game if there is a player who believes everything his predecessor does.

RATING: 8.2
Simply the best guessing game. Love it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
History is nice and I understand the charm of the idea. The game system is compact, but at times it really makes you feel stupid as some of the events are just way too obscure which leaves a lot in the game for chance.

RATING: 6.5
Anno Domini is one of the very few games my wife also likes to play. So thats the very main reason I own a couple of it. I also think its fun, but the fun begins when you play with at least four players (five or six are even better). You should also make sure that you don't have an "expert" in the round (played the Natur topic two times with a biologist teacher... no fun! ;o) ).

Just takes way too long for what it is. As a real filler, it would be much better. This one gets a bonus point for the funny cards.

Best expansion I have seen so far. The reason  lies behind the totally absurd facts you get to know.

RATING: 7
Nice quiz-guessing game! I never thought about it, but there are almost a unlimited number of cards and possibilities. How much reasearch must be done to compile one set of possible answers? :) Wow!

Order events by timeline. A little dry. Flopps has some funny cards with dark humor, but still a lot of dry ones. Some tragedies should not have been included in this edition.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.4
Guessing and bluffing. Good knowledge game where actual knowledge doesn't guarantee you to win.

And this edition about historical failures even is fun in itself.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Mixed all Anno Dominis, so no special counting for each one

Flopps ist definitiv die beste AD Edition bei der man sehr, sehr viel Schmunzeln muss.

A smirk and fun edition of the Anno Domini series.

I would not propose to play it on any of our geek afternoons, but it is a game that we can enjoy even with my father-in-law on christmas eve. And the best thing: he wins. :-D

Nice filler. You don't have to be a historian to play Anno Domini but a broad generel education will help.

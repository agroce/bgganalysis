An interesting implementation of the rondel mechanism coupled with some engine-building and special powers.  Fun enough, I guess, but it really didn't grab me.  My choices were super constrained (I can't get X this turn - oh well!), narrowed to a linear path (I want A but I need to move the guy from A to do that, but he needs to move to C, so I need to move C to D first...), or occasionally wide open (um, guess I'll go here...).

I've played three times, I enjoy playing this game.

Things I find lessen the game a bit:
- long setup and explaining the rules to newcomers
- the leader is only used for setup and is useless after that 
- room choice is very random, I've read some people suggest drafting the rooms and that might be better
- there is very little player interaction (similar to a game like Scythe) and the "pressure" does not do much

The mechanisms and theme are awesome with this one, but the scoring only seems like one aspect matters... Rooms, and the dudes in the rooms?  If you don't max those out, you will not be able to compete?  Seems a bit odd, but maybe i went in with an expectation that didn't match what the game offers.  Want to try again, but so far am definitely wishing their were more paths to victory.

RATING: 8
Interesting euro with an unusual theme for a euro (much more AT). Like it, a lot.

It's described as worker placement, but it isn't really, as you move your 'workers' each day, it's more a rondel game - but you can go both ways round the rondel and you can't stop where you have someone already (so it gets a bit brain burning if you tend to AP).

Half the game is moving on the surface collecting stuff, the other half is managing your shelter and driving the VP engines, lots of variety here and routes to consider and quite a bit of replayability with the variety of rooms available (and equipment).

Might be to  'interactive' for some - apart from the take stuff before you do element (present in a lot of worker placement) there is also a 'pressure' element where if you turn up with a stronger group you get a tribute payment from the weaker (or force them to spend ammo stopping it).

Deluxe version is nice, although box is ridiculously huge. A few graphic niggles - holes on the airlock (deluxe) don't line up with the board printing, rooms aren't named (which would help with theme immersion), rule book reads like a google translation (fixed with a PDF) but it's still possible to learn and play the game without trouble. Deluxe contents needs the deluxe board to comfortably fit stuff on (but the board was an optional buy that some might have passed on).

First game will take a while - if nothing else you get a choice of rooms and leader so have to make decisions in a vacuum - you have no idea what is 'good' or sensible even. Better to remove those options for the first game and add them back once you know what you're doing.

RATING: 8
Is a bit fiddly in all the different resources that are around the board, but it is a great worker placement type game where you are collecting resources, building rooms, and recruiting survivors to score the most points.  The myriad of equipment you can build and all the different events and ways to mess with other people and defend yourself makes this game very interesting.  Looking forward to playing this one again.

Wow. Way better than expected. Completely solid worker placement. Theme is intricately woven. Plays well solo and multiplayer. Great production. Incredibly pleased. Blasted my expectations out of the water. Rarely does a theme mesh so well with its mechanics. Perfect blend. Lots of choices, options, strategies. Solo horde is difficult to beat, but doable, Great play time of an hour. Strongly Recommended.

Negatives? Plastic players tokens in collectors edition look decent, but are difficult to tell apart at a glance. Much prefer to use the wooden meeples which are easy to see at a glance. Also, I wish the Event and the Leader cards had different back of card graphics to tell apart quickly.  But these are quibbles.

If you like FALLOUT, go for it! If you like worker placement, go for it! If you like post apocalyptic worlds, go for it! it's a beautiful game, it's simple, it's intense, you can think about your next move while the others are playing, you need to constantly adjust your strategy, you need to adapt, you need to make difficult choices. what to build to make your people survive? If you go for water you might not be able to go for food, but on the other hand, wood is necessary to repair your shelter, but in that case the other players may attack you while you are collecting...
It's not a very "agressive game" players can attack other groups but with a bit of planning you can avoid being attacked (for some time, at least). Being agressive by constantly attacking other players to steal resources won't make you win at all, it's all about what you do with your resources. I love this game!
PS: there are zombies in this game!

[2 Feb 2018] - 6.5 (1 play)
The theme of the game and the artwork is evocative and pulled me in to trying out the game. The game play is just average. Workers go to specific places on the board to collect a handful of resources. Those resources are used to gain other resources or bonus items for yourself. Meanwhile the game is beating you up every turn. You could swap out the specific resources for any other worker placement game and you'd have the same game. There was nothing new or cool in the game and the theme got old around the 3 round. The production decisions were also interesting. Two layered player boards and vivid chits for resources but then all the workers meeples look like slow down signs and the artwork for all the survivors is the same. Not one I feel compelled to play again.

KS deluxe edition. The game looks marvelous. The artwork and minis are fantastic. I really enjoy the game. The worker placement is fun and challenging to make sure you don't lock yourself out of the things you want. The biggest flaw though is the rooms. They give the impression of being a cool tableau building feature that offer you benefits and bonuses throughout the game, but they are actually deceptive and will actively *hurt* you. Most rooms are only worth building at the end and not for their stated bonus but just to hold survivors. Passing out random rooms at the beginning is ridiculous and horribly unbalanced as well. Rooms should be drafted or house rules invented to better distribute them throughout the game as well as house rules needed to make the rooms less of a penalty and more of a bonus like they should be.

There is a fun, very thematic game here but the issue with the rooms keeps this from being a great game and for some (like my family) even being good. (my wife & her sister refuse to play again until alternate/better rules for the rooms are worked out). This feels like it should have gone through another few months of play-testing & refinement to reach it's full potential.

Puzzley Euro: resource collection with a spatial optimisation aspect[/size]

Despite the dystopian post-apocalyptic Ameritrash theme and artwork [thing=191051][/thing] is at heart pure Euro.  Your four people go around a rondel, upto two spaces at a time, activating the various spaces, but, and this is the key, only if you are not already present in that space.  This small rule means the game takes on a real puzzley feel as you try and ensure your people get to the right place in the right order.  On top of this your people have different powers and if you turn up some place with weaker other people there you steal some stuff form them.

The game is hugely stressful to play, and I mean that in a good brain-burning way.

It is an interesting puzzle.  You are ultimately trying to fill your rooms with people, but that means feeding your people.  So you need to build an engine early in the game to maximise your abilities on the rondel, and you do this with the objects and rooms you acquire.

There is nothing particularly innovative here, but there is a great deal to think about and the interplay of rondel/action/feeding is a puzzle worth checking out.

It's a solid worker placement game. Collector's edition is overproduced in my opinion. There are difficult decisions during each game and I love that. The theme is present and flavorful but in many instances awkwardly implemented and some strategies seem much more powerful then others (hunting vs everything else) but there is yet a lot to see.

This game may end up making a 9 spot on my list but after one play im skeptical. The game is awesome, and it feels like an adventure which is part of the reason I bought this game, but not sure about the replayability yet and that is the most important factor of a game for me even if I enjoy it. There is not a lot of depth because you collect the same resources over and over however the game is challenging because of the requirements on how you use these resources through feeding survivors, hunting, building rooms/tools. It was a great first game but im curious if the game will ever become bland after so many plays. I really enjoy the survival aspect and the trial cards which add challenges to each round. Difficult game to master and rich in theme.

This game does a great job of conveying the theme of trying to survive an apocalypse. Scarcity is the name of the game, and the experience is not so much engine building as it is eking out a slightly better turn than the last. The game is aptly name “outlive” and not “thrive”, heh. None of this is to say I don’t like it, I do, however with some variant rules.

Firstly, the game is billed as "worker displacement." What that means is that you have four worker pieces that start on the board in one of 8 spaces. Each turn you move one of them, but you can't move one to a space you already occupy. So if you got water last turn and need it this turn, you first have to move your other dude out of that space and then hope there's still water there by the time your turn comes around. 

Furthermore, you have workers of values 3-3-4-5 which is how many actions they get when they move to a space. If a higher worker moves into a lower worker's space, they pressure them. Say, a 5 moves into a space with your 3 dude. Your 3 dude has to either fire two bullets or surrender two resources. So, you have to put bullets on your shopping list each turn along with everything else. Moving your workers on the board each turn is a nice puzzle and more tricky than I expected. 

Your player board is your home base. In the end of round phase, if you have enough resources, you can build a room. Each room is a specific bonus power that you selected pre-game. You have these survivors who staff your base. You select which room(s) they're going to staff and, consequently, which bonus power(s) they're going to activate next round. Naturally, there's a feeding component here, and if you don't feed your people they run off or die (whichever thematic choice you prefer).

So, you choose which powers to go into the game with and when to bring them online considering your current situation. Furthermore, you can also craft weapons that give you boosts to your actions (+1 food when getting food, etc.). I like me some bonus powers. 

Lastly, there are six turns and each turn an event is flipped over. Not only does this do annoying or otherwise catastrophic things to you, but it's a chance to get VPs by "overcoming" the event by paying the requisite resources. Thing is, events that nobody overcomes stay active, so their effects stack. 

Each turn, then, is a puzzle of how to domino-move your workers on the board while trying to collect enough stuff to build more rooms and equipment and, oh yeah, people gotta eat and drink while trying not to be pressured by rival groups. Overcoming some events to make life easier and get some VPs would be nice too. Oh, and radiation hits you each turn as well for negative VPs. Figuring out how to pull all that off is fun and the theme is a plus.

While I like the game, I think it’s too tilted towards hunting. You need to hunt to get more and more food so as to attract more and more survivors so as to power more and more rooms. This means rooms and equipment that buff hunting are strictly better than anything else and it tilts the game too much in that direction IMO. We have some variant rules that I will post to the forums.

I enjoyed this, the worker placement is fairy simple and intuitive however an additional layer of depth is gained by the very simple bully mechanic. If my worker is stronger than your worker you must either fight me off (spend bullets) or give me tribute equal to the difference(give up resources). This adds a layer of weighing up need versus loss if you get bullied i.e do I [i]have[/i] to get this now or could I wait and see if that bully moves off? I
t also adds player interaction as you try to determine which actions and in which order your opponents are going to take so you can dodge their bully, or capilalise with yours.

It is a very tight economic game whereby you [i]have[/i] to find a way to feed everyone every turn and honestly I am a bit unsure what I think about this as one player got into a position whereby for several turns they were simply keeping their head above water i.e spend the whole turn scrapping enough food together to keep everyone alive, but not making any progress towards anything else. 

End game scoring is a bit hit and miss, it seems far to easy to spam dudes in rooms in the final turn, scoring for each dude. This point gain is certainly a lot bigger than the points gained from events etc.

I normally rate a game only after at least two plays, but I'm disappointed enough with the experience to mention it. I was happy to give it a try, but mechanically the game felt somehow like a sports car with loose bolts or a leaky speed boat. Thematically, it's nice. I can see what the designer was going for, and respect the effort. But during the game I felt constrained in ways that were frustrating more than stimulating, and hurt during the game in ways that felt random and gratuitous, without any obvious way to overcome that misfortune. It strikes me as the kind of game that would be more fun among a table of experienced players. But I'm not inspired to ever get to that point myself.

Euro game with a theme but don't get distracted by the theme. The heart of the game is using your 4 workers over 6 rounds to gather resources and build up. While the events are cool and it would seem like we should solve them, they are not worth it early on as you slow down building up your action economy too much. They were a big trap in my first game for those that completed them early

Gaining action economy through rooms/equipment is key in this game. Majority of your points scored will be from maintaining survivors and maxing out rooms. Equipment is a bit of both, increasing your action economy as well as some vp.
There doesn't really seem to be multiple scoring victory paths. Rooms & Survivors will give you the most points and you supplement that with event/equipment points

I would be interested in trying out different room/starting combos. However it doesn't seem like all the rooms are balanced so I would prefer maybe a drafting variant to select your starting ones (also to better plan a strategy around them). Would be fun for a few games but I don't think this one has staying power as the theme doesn't really connect with the mechanics that well and there is limited variability. Like why can't you move people around rooms at night and why are most rooms 1 time use. There are component issues too (KS minis are too hard to play with, hunt tokens shouldn't have been double sided, no marker for tracking if you have used a building, etc)

Decent game with a post-apocalyptic theme and variations on the worker placement mechanic. Interestingly, your placements are not limited by the other players' workers (or heroes, as they are called here), but by your own, as you must move them across a short distance and may never have two at the same place.

The heroes have different strength values and there is a sometimes annoying take-that element as the stronger can steal from weaker. But that can be easily prevented by stocking ammunition, thus it's also pointless. Anyhow, you are basically moving around the board and collecting resources. At the end of the round, you can spend them to maintain your colony, recruit survivors, build and man special rooms, and fix equipment.

There are some small problems, such as excessive randomness and unbalanced scoring, but in general the game works well enough. It's less fiddly and much better than "Anachrony", another game with similar theme and mechanics that was on Kickstarter around the same time. They were also similar in having an exclusive deluxe version with plastic miniatures. I played this version, and it does have some better components, but the hero miniatures, with their clumsy and poorly designed bases, make the board situation hard to see at a glance. The survivor miniatures are a bit of a nuisance, too, as they often got stuck in the airlock tile when I wanted to move them.

Average game.

The climate is not strong.  The mechanics plays first fiddle.

Sadly, the competition between players does not generate the tension.  Everybody just optimizes their own play and maximizes their final score.

It seems some players can blocked for some turns not by their fault, but due to the plain lack of commodities available and then the snowball syndrome occurs.  The others who are not blocked develop their engines and compete for a victory while the wretches have no chance to get back in the game.
This shouldn’t happen…

Initial Rating: 7.0 (June 2017)

I almost never back new games on Kickstarter but as I played 10' to Kill (which has good components) from La Boite de Jeu I thought it would be ok to back Outlive and it was. The campaign ran smoothly and I got my game some time ago. The other reason I backed it, was the theme. I LOVE apocalyptic themes.

In the KS campaign they said the game was about worker displacement, after playing it I don’t understand the statement, the game uses a normal worker placement mechanism, you don’t displace anything (unless a friend explained it wrong :D).

The rules of the game aren’t too complex, but you have many of them, you can explain them under 20 minutes. Playtime is around 3 hours with 4 players.

I have the collector’s edition which have great components, you have a lot of miniatures (survivors, bullets, chips, water, cans, player pieces) and they are very detailed. The survivors miniatures are great as there are 5 (I think) different models. The player´s pieces are good as well but they can confuse the game situation. If you see them from certain angle you are not sure if they are active or inactive. In our game, at least 4 times players made a mistake due to this. The art of the game is great. Having said that, I know I’m in the minority because I mostly prefer to avoid miniatures in games. I know they look great but in many past KS the focus of the game has been on the miniatures leaving gameplay too shallow, Cool Mini or Not is particularly guilty of this behavior, so I always suspect a game which has great miniatures. Gladly, it isn’t the case in Outlive, gameplay remains interesting. Outlive comes in a big box which have lots of mini boxes, the mini boxes look great but they are filled with air. It is funny (and a bit sad) when you unpack the game and you find 5 small miniatures occupying 1/10 of the space available in the mini box and you have lots of these boxes. I would have preferred a small box, as it is, it is full of air. To summarize this point, the collector edition of the game comes with a huge box with lots of air and the player´s pieces can confuse players during the game. The components are great though.

I love the buildings (my favorite component), they have holes in them to accommodate the survivors and they look great on the player´s board. They are very reminiscent of Fallout Shelter and This War of Mine videogames.

Outlive´s theme is great! One of my favorites, but it is mainly supported by the art and components. You don´t feel it through the game´s mechanisms which is a shame :(, but nothing unexpected from an Euro game.

The game´s decisions aren’t obvious and you need to plan in advance which actions you are going to do and with which worker. Each turn is divided by day and night. On the day you can move your workers around to hunt, get objects, scavenge in cities, get water, canned food, get bullets and chips. What makes this phase very interesting is the limitation of your workers, they can move 2 spaces each and they can´t remain where they are, so you need to plan very well or you won’t accomplish your goals. In addition, the items are limited, so you want to get them first and your workers aren’t equal, they have strength and if you approach an opponent with a stronger worker you can mug him :D. Due to all of these, the day phase is tense and interesting. The night phase is also interesting, in this phase you feed your people, get radiation, repair your gear, use your buildings and distribute your survivors inside your dwelling. This decision is important because you can’t move them later and you need a full room to activate its power. It also decides how much water/food you will spend. All things considered, the game offers lots of decisions to make.

The luck factor is present in the game, but it isn’t very high. Luck decides what you get when you look for things in the cities. It is possible you get nothing. Also, there is luck in which objects appear each turn and in the setup when you choose your buildings and the leaders of your dwelling. A friend played with a very similar character to Professor X and he seems very powerful (perhaps he is a promo, I´m not sure), much more than the other leaders but my friend lost the game so who knows. I need more plays to verify. I’m much more worried about the power level of the buildings, some of them seem VERY powerful while others are very situational, I feel they are unbalanced and that’s very bad :(. Luck also decide the events.

Each round, the available workers are the ones laid down, and when they act you have to leave them standing. This is unintuitive and many times we all made procedural mistakes, it should be the other way around. Still this is a minor issue for me.

The mug mechanism is neat, but it appears there is an issue with it. Only in the first turn a player was actually mugged, in later turns all players had enough bullets to defend, so it wasn’t important anymore. I'm not sure if this is the case all the time or only in our first game.

Bottom line, I should love Outlive, but for some reason I can’t pinpoint right now, I don’t. I will give it another chance to woe me but I will probably sell it. Outlive has a great theme and interesting decisions. I feel the regular edition of the game has better usability, the player´s miniatures confuse the game situation because many times you can’t clearly see if they are active or not. There is some luck, I still haven’t decided if it is too much or not, perhaps it isn’t. I’m worried about the buildings, they seem to be unbalanced.

Deluxe Version - Fun Euro/Engine-y builder game. Can be unforgiving if you forget/get blocked out of food/water locations. I love the pressure aspect as it adds to the complexity of what order you activate your workers. Do I use my 5 early to get more stuff or save it to pressure? Having to re-supply every location in between rounds is annoying but if everyone at the table helps it can be quick. Overall, my group enjoys it and it will stay in my collection. Super cool theme as well.

A different take on worker placement, which combines a little "take that" into the mix. Overall a fun game with a couple of drawbacks. The limited movement of your workers each turn tends to add some strategic depth but it also adds to AP. There is also a little too much randomness in the hunting, equipment and searching portions of the game. That being said, it is a decent euro with a little ameritrash thrown in for good measure and the theme works well with the mechanics.

This is a fantastic game. The theme really comes through as you're playing. It really feels like you're locked in a desperate struggle to survive. Resources are scarce and disastrous events plague you at every turn. The components are terrific and the artwork is stunning. There are so many conflicting priorities you need to balance each turn and you're forced to make tough decisions about where to focus your efforts. With the variety of rooms, events, and equipment, there is a large amount of replay value.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

The theme comes through well and the rondel-ish action selection as well as the "bullying" works well. However, I was disappointed in final game scoring that really seems to require one to build all the rooms and fill them with survivors if you want to win. The other things that gain points just don't seem to do enough to overcome the power of these two aspects of scoring and both go hand in hand so you basically score twice.

At the moment, i don't know which rating is best for this game.
It has nice designed cardboard components, but the resource token or companion token are a bit to tiny.
But i still prefer this instead of wooden cubes, except shaped wooden resources.
The playerboards are cheap.
Gameplay need to be more tested.
Short version about the gameplay, move your meeples in a few places over the board and get resources and then build something up to get points or more benefits.

Really nice game, interactive and plays differently each time, feels very different from all the generic bland euro worker placement games out there. Glad I backed this, plays well at 2 players (with hordes option possible) and worked out well with 4 players, although our first 4 player game took a while. Nice game, some small language errors and some components could have been better, although these are minor things, great game!

Kickstarter.  Received 7/19/17.

Outlive markets itself as a "Worker Displacement" game, but it's really just a rondel.  However, the hero strength value, strict movement rules, and dual use of each space really create a nice brain burn at times.  The game plays very quickly and is at its core a very simple game.  In that way, it reminds us of Marco Polo, which is another perennial favorite.

The pressure mechanism isn't nearly as mean as we thought it would be, given the numerous way to mitigate (ammunition) or completely cancel out (equipment).  The Rooms give a nice amount of variable setup, but we found that some can be quite overpowered with the right board setup.  We love the variable round events as well, which really remind us of Troyes.

The big downside is that scoring seems extremely biased towards filling rooms with survivors.  I do wish there were paths to victory.

+ Beautiful production values (map, miniatures, dual layered player mats, etc.)
+ Rondel mechanic often yields difficult choices
+ Tons of variable player powers (rooms/equipment)
+ Variable setup (heroes/events)
+ Amount of resources often results in a "knife fight" to get key resources like water
- Only one real path to victory

Really loved playing the game with a prototype, it's a survival/gestion game with rules quite easy to get and to explain, but the game is really challenging, with a lot of different ways to score. 

The theme is really present in the game and you feel the pressure of the survival with the radiation, the events and also the pression of the other squad wich are stronger than yours.

Game mechanincs are really cool and the game is quite fast for a gestion game. Can't wait to receive it in february 2017 and be able to play it all the time ^^

Excruciatingly long, slow multiplayer solitaire. Spent 1.5 hours just to read the rules! Then an hour of slow play before we got fluent enough to play at a bearable pace. Very little player interaction, the "bullying" mechanic is no doubt to correct this but one trip to the military base for ammo and nobody bothered me the rest of the game. The theme's OK but when you don't care what your opponents do the game turned into 75% downtime. Blech.

I can't believe I picked this up already from my local games store. Incredible.!
After watching several playthroughs and reading the rules I played my first game. This is by far my favorite game to date. The theme and the mechanics really appeal to me.SOLD and bought the collectors edition because I love this game.

Opened this game up today, purchased as a present for myself as this was something I have been anxiously awaiting since the offer to purchase was luckily through the website of https://www.laboitedejeu.fr/en/outlive/ This wasn't the kickstarted pledged purchase but is infact the same collectors edition with miniatures and resin components and stretchgoals, but luckily for me the designers had a few extra copies of this fantastic game and decided to sell off through the website. Right now, having just unpunched and organised the components I am quietly brimming with excitement at playing this deluxe version. I have played the retail version with the standard 3mm black core components and I was content with the quality of the entire product. Possibly the only let down was the size of the main board. But this was due to seeing the massive XL version on the kickstarter  page.This game is definitely just a worker placement game at heart but the theme really brings the entire experience to life. Collecting components and repairing items to increase productivity really creates a sense of direction and achievement. The pressure mechanism keeps players from running away with a lead too which is a nice way to keep this game close at the end.It's Simple but brilliant. Mind you the good games are.

Not as tight and mean as I thought it would be but a really fun game. The worker placement and rondel mix works fine but the game has some really strange design decisions and it clearly privileges one score aspect, what can restrict the paths of victory.

Nothing new here. Standard euro stuff, poor use of different ranked workers (see Lancaster for good use), and the way you can only move your workers up to 2 spaces but not a space already occupied by an inactive worker really restricts your options and requires you to before your first plan out exactly the sequence you can move then effectively. That isn’t fun - just a puzzle to solve - and it means the interaction is very forced. Another overproduced KS game that would have been filtered by a major game publisher but rabid backers let it see the light of day.

I love worker placement games and this is up there with the best. One of the biggest draw backs with the genre is they are normally pretty dry in the theming area. Outlive has great theming, and components. I love the post apocalyptic setting. You are constantly feeling the pressure of both keeping your survivers alive and expanding growing your shelter. "I really want to move and collect building materials to add this room, but I also need to hunt or gather water or a few of my survivers will starve."   There are so many choices to make with very little randomness. Lots of strategy and depth. I have played it several times and each time I am thinking forward to my next play through. All around great game.

RATING: 7.5
Wow great worker placement game with a twist. The limits on your action selection based on where you position your workers makes for some interesting choices. Great tension with the different pressure mechanics with feeding workers and dealing with radiation. 

Pros:
- Unique twist on worker placement mechanics
- Love the tension with feeding and feeling like you can't do enough
- Theme shines through. 

Cons:
- Busy board that can be a little overwhelming
- Rulebook is crampacked and hard to follow

The rondel/worker pressuring mechanic is phenomenal.  The fiddlyness of the player board, building construction and equipment repair drag the game down significantly.  The board is gorgeous and the miniatures are well crafted but the wooden meeples are significantly easier to see and use on the board vs the Kickstarter miniatures.

Tense management of resources, and sometime very tense (water...), in a post apocalyptic era. Even if it's a Euro Game at heart, the theme is very present thanks to Miguel Coimbra stunning artwork and game mechanisms that make sense with the story. Nice learning curve as with the first parties you just try to get enough food and resources for your survivors and after you master more and more how to build the best combos! Good replayability with some variables at the beginning and during the game with the events.

This was a surprise hit addition in my collection. I ordered it on the merits of the theme, design, art, and quality of plastic minis and pieces and assumed it would be a playable if not compelling worker placement. I can say after 5 playthroughs that everyone, myself included, has been much more effusive in praising the fun factor. I highly recommend it.

A fun game with interesting action movements mechanic which brings a lot of tension to the game. For a euro it has a great thematic feel.

I would like to play again but fear that the strategic options are too limited and that there is a scripted best play to achieve 50+ points. Rating will probably go down after a couple more plays.

Some aspects of the game feels like it could have used a little bit more streamlining or clarification.

Excellent game. Nice material, I love the ambiance, paintings. 
Rules easy to catch, easy to play, but complex on planning and strategy. Lacking a bit of interaction between players (scoring game),  You have to catch your own strategy and try to stick on it, but also be flexible in adjusting and changing depending on context.  Shorter than expected at the beginning. Very good game, no regret on the KS and Collector edition. Try to play 4, below might be a bit boring or too easy. I have not tried the solo mode yet.

For solo, a bit unbalanced until the very last turn. I think this would be more fun if it were 8 rounds. Then you'd at least get to see your engine actual work more than once (at most).

After first play there only seems to be  two viable strategies:  Build rooms and put dudes in the rooms with priority in fixing equipment  OR  solve the events with secondary focus on the first stratagem. Equipment tiles offer huge game advantages to the player who makes this a priority.

It is beautiful to see on the table and one of the best produced games I have seen in a while --

Tested once (prototype). Excellent game with 2 distinct yet entangled game phases: worker placement (in a very innovative way) and ressource gathering during day time, ressource use and base development during night time. Deep and challenging without being too complicated. Highly anticipated game on my side.

My excitement for this game had grown to extreme skepticism during the long wait for my Kickstarter copy.  I was worried that I had spent too much on a pretty simple game.  

I'm glad to report that I'm happy with the purchase.  It's not a blow-you-away game, but there's a good amount to balance and consider each round lots of interaction not just besting people to locations, but also potentially stealing resources or forcing them to dump ammo to prevent it.  Each move had a lot of risk reward.  I thought some rooms felt overpowered, but it all seems pretty balanced overall. 

In the light/medium worker placement category, I enjoy this much more than Champions of Midgard and even Raiders of the North Sea. It feels fresh enough to stay in my collection for when I want a worker placement game with a bit of teeth. 

It's a very novel spin on Worker Placement where your workers never leave the board.  This forces you to plan ahead, to consider future positioning, and also to consider all of your opponent's around you as they can dry up resources or put pressure on you if you activate the wrong worker too early.  Really smart.

The Collectors Edition is absolutely gorgeous, but it's also the most oversized box, which means it will sadly see much less play than I'd like.

Las partidas que he jugado siempre han sido a 3 jugadores. Creo que a 4 la experiencia ha de ganar, ya que los asaltos a otros jugadores serán mucho más abundantes (que es lo que le da salseo al juego). De cualquier manera, me ha parecido un colocación de trabajadores muy muy bien ambientado y con un tema bien metido. 
Espero que esa nota ascienda cuando lo juegue a 4 jugadores.
Recomendable!

Love the game!  The player mats, the minis, the boxes!  Everything is great!  It's very thematic; I felt like I was actually trying to survive some horrible catastrophe.    

The rulebook could use some work.  My group had some issues where things weren't exactly explained clearly but we went with what felt right going along with the theme of the game.

RATING: 6
Unique, non-zombie based post-apocalyptic theme, which is a bit rare.  Definitely has some interesting parts.  But it feels a bit like a typical, half-baked kickstarter.  Very thematic, but unfortunately many elements run counter to the theme, or are themselves very unthematic, so it is a mixed bag.  It can definitely pull you out of the theme.  There is a good base here, but unfortunately, poor development.  Art is beautiful, but a bit busy, and the number of bits may send you over the edge.  Very fiddly, spend lots of time moving around small bits.  Really could use some streamlining.

Finally a post apocalyptic game I can get behind. A really interesting mix of spatial worker placement/action selection (with limited resources) and a Fallout Shelter style base builder where you spend those gathered resources to give yourself special powers.
A good game length, deluxe components are AMAZING, and there's a ton of choices to make. Interaction is really interesting as well, with stronger opponent heroes applying 'pressure' to weaker ones which leads to stolen resources. I'd already like to see more equipment, and maybe some rooms that require specific materials to repair, but overall, this one is a winner for me

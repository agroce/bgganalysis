Wow, what a fantastic game!   A great, if anachronistic, addition to the 18XX family.   Really straightforward to pick up, and it irons out some of the game-breaky type moves that exist in other 18XX games.

Much different than the usual 18xx.  It is quite long and features some randomness, but the mechanics are interesting.  There are a lot of trains [spaceships], so players have to understand when it's in their interest to keep the game moving, i.e. when the TSI buys three level-1 ships, it needs to be obvious to at least a couple of the other players that they should rust them, preferably quickly.  One downside is that planning routes, or rather, planning the bases and fuel stops so that you can achieve better routes is a difficult computational problem, which can lead to a lot of downtime.

9/9/17: Got in 6 hours with a 3 player game and did not finish. The biggest negative with this game is its length.  It would be nice if it was an hour or two shorter.

The pluses to this game are that it is very different from other 18xx, and that its fun.  You get to explore with laying tiles, so the board is going to be very different each time.  The focus is on well run companies with good runs, there are less opportunities for stock shenanigans than other games.  If you know what you are doing, you should really be focusing on setting up the end game from the very beginning.

Nate likes the #1 private because it has great position and turn order.  TSI really comes on strong in the midgame, to the point where you want to start doing partial dividends.  The Asteroid League is real strong when it starts.

We seemed to be a little short on status counters in our last game.  Not critical.

Plays well with 3 or 4.

3/27/10: A 9 hour game.  Not certain I'll be playing this one all that often, but I'm glad I did.  The minors are a lot of fun to run.  As a new player, you'll definitely be at a disadvantage to those who have played before, but you'll still have a good time.  Towards the end there isn't anything to spend money on, and so it piles up.

Devotees of the "18xx" series of railroad games, all loosely based on 1829 by Francis Tresham, will recognize 2038 as belonging to the same intellectual lineage, even though almost every detail of play is different. Completely absent is the series' railroad tile mix - there are no tracks in space. The forging of territorial links between cities is replaced by the exploration, development and claiming of mines. Growth Corporations alter the game's financial aspects as well by linking Independents to the larger, publicly traded Corporations. ...providing interesting choices at every juncture.

Purist probably loath the 'luck' of the tile draws, personally I like it, and the growth corporations give a different option to running a company. However I don't much like the companies coming out in a set order (like 1835) and you need experienced players to make the bidding system work as a balancer - not easy with a game of this length.

On balance I don't see me playing this as much as some of the shorter 18xx tiles 

*** Update, I can't see me ever playing this again unfortunately - the starting auction as a balancer for the companies doesn't work until you know the worth of them, last few times I've played TDSI president has run away with it. Now with the release of 1861 I can play 'growth' corporations in a game that purist will play.

Trade Routes and Corporate competition in Space!This game spawns directly from the great train games 1830-1835 etc.  If you like this sort of this this could be a great way to chage the scenery and enjoy something different.  The game is a hearty game involving many different aspects to build a net worth of value.  The value is a combination of stocks in various corporations and straight up cash.There are corporations that make money in various commodities (nickel-ice-rare ore) by delivering and setting up trade routes efficiently.  As corporations form and build or grow they increase in value therefore moving your asset pool up or down in value.I liked this game as I found it hard to comprehend the outcome of the endgame and it always kept each play invovled.  The aspect of the endgame where the game ends when the bank is depleted is off putting for me and the turn time can be hinderous but otherwise I like this game a lot.

This game introduced me into train gaming and playing it the very first time is still on of my best gaming memories.

 We quit after 5 hours (midnight) right after we broke the Phase 6 trains (final phase). It's a fun game but very fiddly. I'd need to be in the right mood to play it again. I find the growth company concept interesting. I also found all of the different resource types/bounses/etc. interesting but the fiddliness that resulted from it means it'll be a long time before I feel like getting this back on the table.

Really great game even though it's 6-8 hours long.  My first game took 9 hours and I'm more than willing to play it again because it's so freakin' interesting.  Also, I like some luck in my games so the randomness of 2038 suits me very well compared to the other 18xx games.  Unfortunately the starting auction can decide the game ahead of time which is a bummer.  Not enough money and the potential for some real killer combinations of companies makes experience necessary, and letting one person have too much TSI early will make you lose.  Still, lots of fun!

RATING: 6
A lot of very cool stuff in this one, but there are two rahter major problems: a) it is *extremely* long, much too long for comfort; b) the start packet stereotypes early play and strips the players of a lot of control over how the game unfolds. A lot to like, but it won't likely reach it's potential until (if) the long-awaited expansion appears. I sincerely hope this happens, because there is a tremendous game in there somewhere.

RATING: 5
2038 takes the wonderful 18xx system and attempts to remove as many of its interesting, difficult decisions as possible.  Considering each player has hundreds and hundreds of tiny decisions to make in the game, it's amazing how many of them were either obvious or so incalculable as to be arbitrary.  I'm not particularly interested in spending 8 hours making hundreds of easy or arbitrary moves punctuated by maybe five juicy choices over the course of the game.

The initial auction is epic and insanely difficult, both in terms of cash management and in terms of evaluating relative worth of each item to each player.  Due to the strength of many of the properties up for grabs, it's clear that (for example) if player 1 gets Property A, he is under no circumstances to also win Property X.  However, the auction is conducted 1830-style, and with $1430 of property to sell off spread over 12 properties, and only $1800 of player cash, we found positioning ourselves in the auction to be completely unmanageable.

2038 is fussier than a spoiled baby.  Practically every entity in the game has a minuscule special power ($10 for delivering X type of good, for example).  These powers help to keep the board feeling a little less crowded in the late game, as different pickup spots will have slightly different values to each company.  Like almost every element of this game's design though, the benefit is not nearly worth the amount of energy required.

It's fair to say I found the stock game completely uninteresting and can't really imagine a scenario where that changes.  As a result, if I am looking for this type of logistical exercise wrapped in a strong business package, I would always rather play Indonesia (which is as 'elegant' as a Knizia by comparison).  And if I want to play a giant business game, 1856 (or any other big 18xx) has much more interesting considerations at every turn.

[b]Pros[/b]
Probably not as good of a game as 1870, but much shorter (rating different, for PbEm/f2f). Easily playable in 5-6 hours, probably less with moderator or experienced play. 
The companies will experience a different game each time due to the minor fluctuations in tile draw. The randomness it introduces is not the problem that I thought it would be.
The opening auction has a *lot* of potential for odd outcomes, since all of the PCs are either minor corps, income+share, or income+Pres.
Routes are much simpler to calculate (but more difficult to establish) than usual.

[b]Cons[/b]
This game is really only about having a good portfolio. 
Features half-dividends, but in an even stupider than usual format (-1w,+1h,+2f). 
Features single decrease cap sales. 
The train mix is awful.

Preliminary rating after one play.  After buying, selling, and buying this game again, I finally managed to play a game of this thanks to Joe Huber.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, and would like to play again sometime, but even with Joe pushing the game forward, took 5 hours for three players; even if I managed to get interested players again sometime, I'm not confident that I could finish the game in any reasonable amount of time without Joe there to keep it going (and run the spreadsheet for calculating payouts!).

There is a lot to think about in 2038.  I am still making mistakes early on, and don't feel I am competent, but I'm starting to be able to see what particular mistakes I am making, at least.  Recently I played a game in which I formed a plan and carried it out.

In this game, it's important to think about and work on your late-game runs from the very start of the game.  This need to plan strategically is a big draw for me.

One good feature of this game is that a company's OR turn starts with running ships.  This means you don't have to think about base, refueling station or claim placement in connection with *this* turn's run.  Of course, you *do* have to think about setting up next turn's run...

I also have the print and play expansion, which is a valuable addition.  It provides more options, especially by allowing you to start corporations in any order.

Only played a short game. I understand now why people suggest replacing the money with poker chips. Enjoyed this one very much, the random tile draw isn't a problem and shouldn't completely knock a company out of competition just due to some bad draws. I very much like the independent/Asteroid League interactions. The only other 18xx I have played is one play of 1830, and I miss the volatility of the 1830 stock market, though I suspect the sharp plays might lie elsewhere in 2038. Short game didn't feel like a bad version of some greater game, it had interest all the way though, and seemed to end just after the formation of the AL, which felt like a natural point to break. Very pleased and want to play much more.

Short game for 3players clocked in about 4hrs for 2 players new to 18xx and me with only 1 play of 1830 years ago.

RATING: 6
Another in the 18xx train game series, but this one is in space.  It's more about mining Nickel, Rare metals, and Ice, and delivering them to destination bases.  There are no "track" pieces to lay, so there are many more options for each player -- a company's ship can reach any hex within its movement range limit.  This makes it much more complicated than 1830 in some ways, but less vicious in that it's harder to block company routes.

I've played this once and while I enjoyed it, I lost miserably, because I didn't run my companies' stock up always -- near the end, I withheld 50% of my dividends to save for permanent trains.  It's especially important to run growth companies with full dividends on every turn because they start with a stock value of $10, much less than the par value of $67.  In other words, you've lost $57 as soon as you buy a share of the growth company's stock; it requires many turns of full dividends to make up that difference alone!

This 18XX variant scratches the space-exploration/exploitation itch like no other. Although the game centers around stock ownership similar to 18XX, 2038 features a random exploration mechanism, which wonderfully simulates exploring the unknown--there are no track tiles.

At the start of the game, there are six independent companies, and six private companies that conduct the exploration/exploitation. As the game progresses, new growth and public corporations can be started, in a semi-scripted fashion like 1835, but with more flexibility in choices. What is novel in 2038 is that private companies can transform into growth companies, much like an IPO, transferring existing assets. They have poor capitalization and extremely cheap stock values, but are active immediately, even only with a president's 20% share, thus having potential to grow in value over the long run with very little investment. Public corporations are floated in the same manner as any other 18XX, but only when 50% shares have been sold. Since money can be scarce early on, the growth option offers a welcome alternative. The privates can also wait for a later phase in the game where they become part of the Asteroid League, which is similar to the nationalized Prussian Railroad in 1835, or they can be bought out by another corporation. On the other hand, Independents are gradually "stripped" of their ships and claims, being slowly acquired by other corporations.  

The game opens up gradually as players, acting through their companies, explore hexes surrounding their starting bases for nickel/ice/rare metals, in the Asteroid Field of the Solar System. It is similar to Galactic Emperor, where ships enter a hex and discover varying levels of the three resources, which are then mined and delivered to various bases scattered throughout the playing area. Ship locations are not static pieces that move around the board, but rather "virtual" representations of potential movement, starting from fixed company bases. New bases can be developed on previously explored asteroids, thus increasing further the operational range of the company ships. The maximum range of ships can be extended through refueling stations that can be built along routes.

The exploitation mechanism is novel in that mines produce fixed high/low values depending on whether they are claimed or not by a given company once per operating round, and since they are never exhausted, they are similar to the income received from towns/stations in 18XX. However, since there are no tracks, players are free to chose which mines/resources to exploit on a first-come, first-served basis, subject to the movement points and cargo capacity of the space ship they are operating.

As of 2012, the game is 17 years old, and the components reflect that: perforated cards, thinner card stock, and counters that don't punch cleanly. The artwork is bland in the traditional sense of 18XX, although the asteroid tiles are nicely detailed. The rules are only four pages, although densely packed in--exhausting to read--9/10 point font. There is also a four-page quick-start guide, which is moderately helpful, and a four-page player's guide. 18XX players should have little difficulty finding rule parallels with other 18XX systems, but newcomers will have a tougher time.

Even with two other 18XX veterans, rules explanation (we actually used the quick-start guide) took 90 minutes. Although we played the "short-game", completing Phase I, including the initial stock auction, took nearly three hours! Thereafter, stock rounds took about 30 minutes, and the two operating rounds took about 60 minutes. We managed to get to Phase III to start the Asteroid League, but had to call the game at five hours. We anticipate that several more "short games" are needed before attempting the full game, which has six phases.

3-player was just enough for a first-time, and we collectively believe four may be the sweet spot. We agreed that the "short game" had enough interesting decisions that it was well worth playing first before attempting the longer game, thus making it a very satisfying learning game. The exploration feel is similar to Entedecker, which we enjoy, plus the stocks portion of the game has several interesting and unique aspects that feel a lot closer to how real-world companies operate compared to other games, including 18XX. The stock game is not as cutthroat as other 18XX games, so this may be a more accessible variant for 18XX newcomers. Although we had a rough start, once we got into the flow of the game, it was thoroughly enjoyable even if shortened. Tentative rating is a strong '8', with very good prospects hitting '9'. With only one short-game play, this is easily my favorite 18XX variant.

Update (04/27/12) 2nd play: 3-player "full" game was stopped at 6 hours. It has been several weeks that we had to relearn all the rules, plus there was one newbie. Set-up is fiddly, and getting underway is tediously slow. Playing the "full" game gave brief glimpses into what the longer game may be like. Both 18XX veterans really like this game. Each operating round took about 40-45 minutes, with stock rounds lasting 25 minutes at peak. It is still a long game, although we feel confident that we can speed this up with repeated plays.

One more thought: the layout of the rules is poorly organized, with rules scattered within three 4-page pamphlets (in highly compressed paragraphs, with tiny font size), as well as the playing board. For example, we were looking for a special case in the pamphlets. It ended up being described in detail on the playing board! This game could use a rules rewrite and reorganization.

Update (08/17/13) 3rd play: 4-player game took 8.5 hours, but we managed to finish a "full" game! As before, start was sluggish relearning rules, but all were veterans. Exploration seems to take awhile, with operating rounds peaking in length, but quickly plateauing and then dropping as claims solidify established routes. First half of the game took about 4 hours to get to the Astroid League formation, while the second half took 4.5 hours. This was the first time to see the effect of Growth corporations, where stock price appreciation is sacrificed for high-income, but this was not enough to beat appreciated higher stock prices of the public corporations. Conclusion is that players cannot afford to leave a sole player with TSI or the Astroid League with 50-60% holdings, as their combined appreciated stock price and income will easily outclass other schemes. The 18XX veterans have commented that overall 2038 is more forgiving on route building, as well as train obsolescence.

Randomness of tile draws can affect the bonuses of specific independents, such as the Ice Man not drawing as many high payoff ice asteroids, compared to other parts of the board. In the end, if all three resource types were claimed, the variance in income seems to be only +/- 10 dollars. Ice will payoff early, with a typical ice asteroid paying 40 unclaimed, and 50 claimed (or expressed "40/50"). Nickel requires investment in claims, since the spread is typically 20/60. Rare has the highest payoff when claimed, the best ones at approximately 50/70. So, there are no huge swings in income based on the tile draws alone; those come from quickly identifying and aligning the bonuses of the independents, and the bonuses for specific resource deliveries at given bases, as well as bonuses for given corporations.

As said before, the game is extremely fiddly, with lots of tiny counters/chits placement and flipping. Play could be sped up with alternate ways of tracking "routes" and used mines. Despite the fiddly-ness and game length, overall it was very enjoyable, and the time seemed to fly by. However, it may be awhile before we can get this back to the table. Holding at a strong "8".

I enjoy the first, say... three-fourths of this game.  The end devolves into unchanging repetition.  Or maybe that's just my group, but I doubt it.

My biggest problem is how easy it is to lose the game in the initial auction.  If you're teaching one player in an experienced group, and he takes no Independents, he's not likely to play again.

RATING: 9
The good:  I love the narrative arc of the game.  More than in any other 18xx I've played save 1856, there is the sense of a real story building up over the course of the game.  The exploration contributes greatly to this arc.  As a theme-minded gamer I appreciate that.  The minors are interesting to run and the growth companies introduce a significant fork in the decision tree, giving players another dimension to consider when forming corporations, in addition to "when" and "for how high a par value."

The less good:  The randomness of the tile draws I don't mind so much, actually.  It can be mildly annoying when the VP can't find any Rare tiles, but seems more of a nuisance than a game-breaker.  It can be argued, and has been, that the replayability is worth it.  The oversupply of trains is a bigger problem, I think.  The train rush in 2038 is more difficult to trigger than in other 18xx titles, which is a perfectly valid position in the design space for it to occupy but is less to my taste than a no-holds-barred, 1830-style bloodfest.  Also the routes are mindbending to calculate, and a bit fiddly as well.

11/15/09:  I'll hopefully play again in a month, and will commit to an integer rating at that point.  More likely 9 than 8.  We'll see.

12/14/09:  Got in a second play over the weekend, this time with 4 players.  The train rush still seems gentler than in many other 18xx titles, but we were able to trigger some spaceship obsolescence in this game.  So I'm willing to attribute the rest of my issues with the trains to personal taste.  I don't think 2038 will ever become my favorite 18xx because of the route calculation headaches, but it's one I'm willing to play any time.

first impression, this is a very fun 18xx, but not without some downsides, mostly that the operations can take far too long to optimize, and that the tile draws can randomly hurt your position in such a long game
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
2038 takes the basic 18xx economic structure and adds in several interesting options that fit well with the theme. Of particular note: there are independent companies that can operate trains and act as an intermediate step between privates and corporations. Each have a variable power of some sort. That power later transfers to the owning corporation in the form of a "pilot." Corporations themselves have variable powers. 

The game is also bookended by the appearance of two major companies; first, TSI, and near the end, the Asteroid League. TSI forms based on the sale of private companies, with the sole bonus for one of them being the director's certificate. But since the independent companies can operate before all privates are sold, players can position and stall before a company with $1000 thunders onto the board. The Asteroid League later forms from a single private company and all of the independents, and looks to be a huge force to be reckoned with. 

I'd have to play more to get a better sense of the game, but 2038 appears to have lots of trains and tons of ore to deliver. I was running Lunar Enterprises for 620 based off of a single phase 2 and 3 ship (3 and 4 train, in regular 18xx lingo). We broke the bank before a single 5 or 6 was built. The "train rush" might not be a defining feature in this iteration of the system. 

Update: The game improved for me during the second session with four players. Our game made it to phase six, the operating order of the companies seemed more significant, and both TSI and AL played a different part. This is a game I plan to get to know better during 2010. Certainly I'd like to play a couple of more 4P sessions and at least one 5P game before going back to 3P. I'd like to see the opening auction with 5 players. 

Update (3 plays): Some concerns are emerging about the initial auction. It needs to be more competitive than it was in my last game.

18xx in space.  Some 18xx players are turned off by the tile laying, I don't mind it.  2038 is a bit more fiddly than regular 18xx because of having to flip and unflip mine counters, and overall I don't find that a big problem.  I like that the companies have more personality with bonuses on various things they can do, and that the pilots add more flavor, too.  Having the possibility of growth companies and the Asteroid League also rewards good planning.  Its a longer game, although the short game can be done in 4-5 hours, and provides lots of good challenge.

I like the 18xx series.  However, I do like this game better.  I do like the random element of the asteroid draws which makes every game different.  It also doesn't have limited upgrade tracks which I always hate (I have played with people who spent too much time looking at all the corporations and trying to use up tracks that other companies need).  Rating after 1 play.

it takes a long time to learn the rules and really know what you are doing. you should set a whole day aside if you want to play a game of 2038 (even if you do know what you are doing). definitely not a game anyone would play often.
that said, it can be a very good experience. open-ended game, lots of possibilities, and it is up to you to turn them into opportunities.

Absorbing game with a nice story arc.  Back in the 90's I played this game quite a few times.  But I haven't played for a long time.  For the longest time this was the only 18xx game I had played.  Now that I have played other, earlier 18xx titles I begin to understand the pedigree of this game.  I still hold this game in high esteem, but would actually prefer to play more 1830 in the near future.  I think 1830 is easier to play.  Not that 1830 is simple!  But the physical manipulation and on board activities are simpler.  

Finally played this again, Labor Day weekend 2012.  Any lessons learned had been lost.  On the bright side, my two usual opponents were quite taken with the game.  So we may play again.

In 2014, I have had Andrew Tullsen make me a nice copy of the expansion to this game.

Rather like this 18xx version.  Seems to have a lot of options, maybe more than some 18xx games.  Need to try again now I have a little better idea what I am doing.

May '14:  my very first win in an 18xx game!  Beat both JeroenD and Eugene, two experts at the genre.  Really good game, although the operating rounds quite fiddly and take a very long time.  Quite a bit of different things going on than many of the other rail games of this type.

An 18XX game with a great theme (space) and some exploration mechanics which I enjoyed but is a make/break point for many fans of the series.  Overall I liked the decisions in the game and didn't think it was too difficult to grasp but I didn't really like the start auction as there seemed to be some unbalance in the companies available (I'm sure with experienced players one would have to pay the correct amounts for the stronger companies).  Also, it's too long to merit bringing to the table with all the other solid (and shorter) 18XX games available.

A couple of solo plays(although it's not really designed for solo play). The rules are not as intuitive as they could be, especially since they're spread out between two separate booklets. However, once you start playing, it does make sense. The components are generally nice, if not exceptional. With four "players" it seemed like a real stretch to make it to Phase III, let alone the later ones.

My 18xx gaming group didn't feel that this game was worthy of being classified as an 18xx train game.  Track building and token placing for trains have been replaced by exploration and claim staking for spaceships.  The stock market works much the same but there are fewer ways for cut-throat players to hurt the leader.  I really like the addition of independent companies (similar to minor companies in 1835).  Still a long game, but probably more novice friendly than the other 18xx train games.

February 2012: After half a full game.

I look at the 18xx series as games of capital management. I like how the best of these games force players to creatively raise and manage capital despite the riskiness of tactics involved. The train part of the game provides the necessary chaos in terms of positive and negative cash flow, which is experienced by all players at different times, to make the stock market/capital management game interesting.

In your typical 18xx game, the only really time consuming part during the track laying part of the game is the arithmetic involved calculating income of the corporation. 2030 replaces this with a true pick-up-and-deliver mechanism. This I though would be cool: you have an actual ship that actually picks up resources and actually delivers them somewhere! However, we found this phase did not offer any decisions interesting enough to merit the fiddliness of this mechanic. I find the pick-up-and-deliver mechanism more interesting in Eurorails because you have to make decisions that have a much longer effect on the game. In 2038, calculating what you should do feels like a repetitive optimization puzzle that, to me, gets in the way of the stock market/capitalization management heart of the game.

(Note: we didn't reach a stage of the game where we started to use bases and refuelling stations. Perhaps these options add strategic depth that we failed to realize.)

As for the capitalization management part, there's a lot going on; however, I can't make an adequate comment about it because we didn't finish our game. There are four kinds of copmanies/corporations:

* private: pay out a fixed income each round
* independent: like share-less corporations; they operate ships on the board; their owners decide whether they split profits or withhold all profits for themselves
* public: like 1830 corporations that receive full capitalization once 50% of shares have been sold
* growth: started by "converting" an independent charter to a president's certificate, par value for the rest of the shares set at $67 but initial share price of $10, and dividends of unsold shares go to the corporation

There's also another corporation that absorbs all the independent corporations. In addition, each independent has a particular and unique bonus when it comes to exploring the map and delivering resources.

It appears that growth corporations are easier to start but much more difficult to increase their share value. I think that players who have growth corporations have to collude with each other and buy each other shares out in order to climb the stock market chart faster.

However, because the exploration part of the game took so long in our game, we weren't able to see the benefits or disadvantages of choosing either to start a growth or public corporation. Anyway, we found growth corporations boring to play in the short term. It might be easier to not buy out the shares of a growth corporation -- dividends for unpurchased stocks go back to the corporation -- and continually pay out dividends, but that kind of game play is really, really boring.

February 2010: Tentative 7 after one play of the short game.

My group is used to 1856, so the rules for full capitalization and the huge importance of the initial auction threw us off.

What we found strange is that not all corporations are available right from the start. We found this very restricting, but then again we weren't very competitive in the initial auction, and as a result, only some of us were able to take advantage of starting public and growth corporations early.

Tile placement, although fun and exciting (there's a push-your-luck element here) is not tactically as interesting as 18xx. You can't intentionall create tile shortages or block your opponents as easily.

Much, much less focused on stock market manipulations, which makes the game feel much lighter.

RATING: 7
A very well done and inventive re-cast of the 18xx system to a SF setting. It suffers from the common problem that the initial stock buys determine too much of the rest of the game. However, the asteroid prospecting and mining is enjoyable enough in its own right to be worth the price of admission.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An initial, intense auction round to determine ownership of private companies kicks off the game. A miscalculation during this phase can lose you the game, allowing an opponent to own powerful combinations of the companies can also lose you the game. Public corporations are then invested in and operated to perform mining + pickup and delivery of goods (ore, ice, rare elements, etc.). Tradeoffs between paying out dividends vs. reinvestment of funds, investment in fleet, purchasing vs. sale of shares, and acquisition and delivery of limited goods with limited movement points each round makes for a complex economic game. At 9 hours of play time for the full version, the value for time spent is very low as this is not a game that can be completed in one session. Need to find a less fiddly, shorter introduction to 18xx.

I'n not usually bothered by games being fiddly, like most big box Splotter games, but with this game it becomes problematic. I do like the gameplay and the ideas of the game, but with no clear overview of the game the joy of playing is diminished slightly...

Traded the game away for Dominant Species...

There is a lot to like here.  For an 18xx fan this offers a unique take on the system that brings something new to what is usually more or less a variation on a theme.  In all actuality its isn't all that different, but the tile draws make for some excitement, and the fact that you don't have to follow any lines really opens up your options.  The stock game doesn't seem as fierce and with so many ships available and so many companies to float ships around between, there isn't the overwhelming dread of the train rush and crunch.  This may be a positive aspect for some people.  

I rather like it, but I feel that for the length of time that this game takes I'd rather be playing 1860, or the longer 1856 (the ORs just take too long to tally up, especially with the millions of little companies).  When we first busted this out we scoffed at the shortened game rules, now we are eager to try them.  There is enough here that is exciting and fun, but the last rounds end up feeling wrote, so there is no sense in pushing this longer than it needs be.

I am not a fan of 18xx games…At least I thought I wasn’t.  Maybe it is just that I am not very good at them.  Well, a friend slid this by me, and even though I knew it was an 18xx game at heart, he kept saying that this was different.  None of that dry adding and calculating.  This was space and exploration and these aren’t trains they’re spceships!  

Well, I am glad he convinced me to play because this is a solid game.  I had no idea of the long term strategy, I haphazardly placed bases and refueling stations and almost ran my companies into the ground, but I had a ton of fun doing it…and I am anxiously awaiting my next play.

I really love the Sci-Fi theme. This is a longish train game in space.  Only played a few times, but would probably play at the drop of the hat. The mechanics are not difficult to grasp but still the depth of play is really good.  There is some luck in this game, which is unusual for an 18xx game.  In fact some people refuse to call this a 18xx variant

RATING: 7
It's better than the railroad games in the same series. The randomness of asteroid placement helps add to the replay value.

It can become slow and dry towards the end of the game though.

The downtime in this game is also significant. If you have slow players, you may want to bring a novel or Gameboy to the table.

In a game where I didn't control a company in the end-game (which I actually won), my downtime between making minor changes in my portfolio was about 40 minutes. I read the rules for a new game I had bought that day, but impatient players may be severely put off by the downtime.

It takes about 6 hours. My rating is lower not because it's a bad game, but because I've played it enough that I have no huge desire to play it again.

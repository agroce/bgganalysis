Quilt show is the Ticket to Ride for crafters.  The game play is so very much like TtR that its easy to dismiss the game as a mere clone.  That is a bit too far though as the game adds some aspects that are unique and quite interesting.  The most significant is the variable "payoff" for the competitions.  Each round has its own prizes in play and it is never a given that you must have the best quilt to really prosper.  This change alone is interesting enough, but the carry over from round to round with an option to sell a quilt at a future point - or not to take part in a show at all really is unique.  As gamers are (unfortunately) mostly male - the real beauty of this game is often dismissed due to its theme.  That is unfortunate as the score mechanisms in the game deserve notice.  And the theme is good to as it opens the gaming world to crafters - who as it turns out are really not much different from gamers after all.

RATING: 5
This is a very light family game that shares the same ticket-to-ride card drafting mechanic. But instead of scoring points by building spatial networks, players score points through set-collection. 

Overall, this isn't my type of game. But comparative to Ticket to Ride, I think this is the better game. The fact that the rewards are constantly changing creates more tension and allows players to deduce what their opponents are trying to accomplish. But like Ticket to Ride, the card-drafting feels repetitive, the game is very light, and the set-up/game time is simply too long for the decisions that the game creates. But for many family gamers, I suspect this may hit the sweet spot and perhaps convert some quilters to boardgames. 

Components are very well done. Great value for the MSRP.

Quilt Show is pretty good. The early game is pretty gentle, as players buy what they can get, but later on it can get aggressive as multiple players are trying to get the patterns they need. The three quilt shows add a nice break to the main gameplay, as there's a bit of optimization required to make the best quilt you can. Even if you didn't do very well at buying fabric and making quilt blocks, you can still hold out hope that maybe there's a good quilt hidden in your pieces. A few bits are more fiddly than necessary, such as taking time tokens every time you build a quilt block, but overall I think this is a good game on the level of Ticket to Ride, and has the benefit of taking up significantly less table space.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
Built on an engine that is very similar to ticket to ride.  I think I would rather play ticket to ride, but the special aspect on making the quilts was interesting.  This one is simple enough that I taught it to my parents, who never play games, but still have enough decisions that a gamer will have fun as well.

My mom is hardcore into quilting, and she got a total kick out of the game.  She was already talking about teaching it to her quilter friends, so if you are at all into the theme, this is a no brainer to pick up.

The components were ok.  The "Made in the USA" stuff isn't as good as what comes out of Germany & China, but its solid.  The paper money in this game is unacceptable for a game that came out in 2014.

RATING: 7
Nothing new, really, in the game but it is tense with anticipation.  Love how the cards are all different and the theme is very interesting and different.  I saw a variant out here somewhere for bonus points on quilts (on how they look).  That might be cool.

Ticket to Ride meets a sewing bee, as strange as that sounds.  Though I would choose TTR over this one (I like watching the development of the board rather than having 3 separate "reveals" of the quilts), there is still enough here to hold my interest, and I believe some of the people I game with will actually prefer this one.  The quilt patterns can be quite lovely once put together, and there is enough strategy involved with everyone purchasing from the same pool of quilt tiles to add a different twist.

A slightly less interesting Ticket To Ride. If you like this theme and like light strategy games, I would definitely give it a try but I personally won't be begging to play it again.

Really nice game.

I feel similarities to the main gimmicks I enjoy in Kingdoms and Queen's Necklace. 

People say Ticket to Ride is the similar game, but I can't get into the idea of agreeing with that. 

It is the extras in game feel and the arranging of the quilts and the cards for artistic merit that pushes this game above the "solid game" territory into the "wow that is a great game" region.

This hits all of the right buttons for me for look and component quality, and it gives me a reason to indulge in one of my favorite pastimes: sorting things.

RATING: 7.5
Great tension in this game playing 4 players, never quite know if the tile you need will still be in play by the time your turn comes around.  It's a bit of a race to see who will bulk up enough buy cards to make their move first at the beginning of each round.  Tension continues as everyone plots to finish out the purchase round before their opponents.  Really liked the "For Sale" style bidding.  Game almost feels like the non-filler version of the game.

It's not too bad.  Gather cards, exchange for tiles, make quilt.  3 different rounds or quilt shows to compete in.  Some strategy involved.  It's a theme you don't see a lot, which is refreshing, especially if you know some quilters or people that enjoy sewing.

This rips Ticket To Ride off badly enough that I feel funny preferring it. But it fixes what I didn't like about TTR by: (1) turning the route cards into an open-ended second layer of set collection (gather matching sets of cards to buy tiles, gather sets of tiles to get points); (2) adding slightly-wild cards that can be either of two colors; and (3) putting in some doublethink around how big a quilt you build when.

Quilt Show is a lovely little gamer's family game; a midweight game which is not difficult to play, and not so deterministic that it could or should be overthought.

One of it's strengths- or weaknesses- is the randomness of stock, of squares available, of awards, which taken together tend to defeat AP gaming with uncontrollable feed by making it so that any player may get key draws.

OTOH, for a Family game, letting a random set of draws favor different gamers may be exactly what is needed and intended in the design, and it can reward non-gamers with a fairly won win over their gaming relatives, producing smiles and happiness 

In it's way, it reminds me of For Sale, expanded and with a quilting theme- this is not a heavy game, but it's well-wrought, and an enjoyable and colorful game for all comers.

Nice little game with a cute theme. The set collection is similar to Ticket to Ride, but it's a little more random and less predictable because you cannot predict what's coming. I do like the aspect of the game that allows you to choose when you will show your quilt and score points (or not)--this particular aspect of the game kind of reminded me of Princes of Florence.

Quilt Show is like Ticket to Ride for Patchwork fans.  Well, less Patchwork.  It's really very Ticket to Ride-ish, but that's not a bad thing by any means.  I think the idea of having each round end with a quilt show (while not only being the reason for the title) also breaks up the game quite nicely.  Just when you think you'd like something else to do, there it is:  quilt show.  While I wish there was maybe a couple more things to do to break up the monotony that may occur, it's a good game that runs just a little bit too long for what it is.

[b]Quilt Show[/b]

[i]First off, I loved the artwork in the game, the tiles and cards are beautiful. I thought it was pretty cool that the designer of the game designed the quilt block patterns for the game.

Now on to game play, this is where the game felt very samey when compared to Ticket To Ride. Granted you are building quilts and vying for different amounts of prize money, but the mechanics and strategies felt extremely similar. You are still managing what cards to pick up vs. when to buy certain quilt blocks. 

All of this is still fun, but I don't have room in my collection to have two games that play extremely similar to one another. For me Quilt Show would fall victim to the Jones theory in favor of TTR and here is why; I love how the board develops when you play TTR it looks great. In Quilt Show the quilts you make don't look that impressive; using 3 or 4 tiles to make a quilt isn't satisfying and they don't really look like much of a quilt.[/i]

I had no expectations going in, and I guess they were met. You pick up lots of cards Ticket To Ride style, or you spend a turn buying as many tiles as you can in one foul swoop. Which makes for the occasional long turn waiting as a player uhms and ahhs  on whether to buy one more tile this turn or not. You're mainly picking up cards in the hope that they'll be useful in a later turn, because their usefulness depends on what tiles are available for purchase later in the round - the cards aren't sought and acquired with the same directed purpose that a specific track section in TtR demands. So you meander along, gathering as you go. At the end of the round, players secretly arrange their tiles in patterns and, effectively in a blind bid, reveal them to determine the value of each and then be awarded VPs for best in show. Ahh, blind bidding, the champion of urgh mechanics! The game goes for three rounds, and yep, you're playing the same game three times. We gave up caring well before then.

I'm a quilter so I have a special appreciation for any sewing game. I like this game because it helps my friends learn more about quilting and how it's done. The sewing screens are my favourite part and I use them alllll the time for other games like qwirkle or for sale where you need to hide your tokens. I wish the quilt patterns were simpler so I could make them in real life. 

Best part about this game is that my ultra nerdy gamer dude friends played it and admitted they like it despite the theme :)

I don't play this one enough!

Is the game perfect?  No, I could see there being issues with the scoring mechanic.  Random scores each round could cause those early small quilts to dominate.  There's little incentive to make a big quilt.  The 1 card for 2 point squares, 2 cards for 3 and 3 for 5 is a little confusing at first.  I also think there may be a slight 1st player advantage.  Also, as far as innovation goes, there's not a lot here - it's basically just Ticket to Ride.

HOWEVER!

I never thought I would be so excited when a Yellow quarter circle quilt square came up and it made my quilt look so pretty. (Yes, pretty!)  The tension of the timer ticking down adds some drama.  Creating nice looking quilts is fun.

And playing this game with my Mom (who is a quilter) really made my day.  She plays games, but with this one she actually opened it up, read the rules and came ready to play.  She also brought it to her quilting group and they all wanted to buy copies.

Nice work on this game!

I had only one play with two players - it seemed underwhelming though the circumstances weren't the best.

I see its potential - there is an interesting race component when building your pool and some memory with optimization when trying to create sets during the scoring round.

Maybe with 3 players the dynamics become more interesting - there wasn't enough tension in a 2 player game.

That said, the theme is incredibly unique and will probably stay in my collection as I can play it easily with my wife.

This game borrows a lot from Ticket to Ride, although there are several important differences. You spend several turns collecting cards from a display, then turn in batched sets of them. This time, though, the theme is quilt making. These cards show one or two colors, or are wilds. Like TtR, you can draft one face up wild card, or 2 other cards. Also like TtR, the display is replenished immediately, and flushed when 3 wilds are visible. When you turn sets in, you may purchase up to 4 tiles -- the topmost tiles from 4 piles -- by paying a matching set of cards (1/2/3 cards for tiles valued 2/3/5). Each pile shows a specific pattern, in one of several colors; these go behind your screen. You also take one time chit per tile purchased -- the phase ends when the time chits run out (and the game ends after the 3rd phase). 

At the end of each phase, there's a show of sorts for 3 prizes (revealed at the start of the phase). Players secretly put their tiles together in up to 3 groups, in specifically allowed configurations (e.g., 1x3, 2x2, 2x3). Each group must be either all the same pattern, or all the same color. Players may also add their single-use 1/2/3 chips to their quilts, increasing their value. These are revealed simultaneously, and the top 3 (based on sum of tile values and chips) earn the cash prizes. ALL used tiles are discarded. At game end, the player with the most cash wins.

So yes, there is a lot of overlap with TtR because of the card handling. But there also many differences. It becomes more important to remember at least a little about what the other player(s) are buying, and infer what kind of quilts they might be making. You have to decide when to use your chips, and even when to make quilts at all (or instead, save your tiles for the next show). I'm not sure how this would feel with more players, though.

This game can be compared very closely with Ticket to Ride.  Play cards to collect sets to display.  

The divergence happens during scoring.  Ticket to Ride, you score as you 'turn in your sets' and with the tickets.  This one you score in a sort of contest.  My sets vs the sets everyone else plays.

It's oversimplification of what actually is happening, but that's essentially it.  I was drawn to this game because of theme.  But I think in the long run, there isn't much here different for me.  But the theme works with some important people in my life.

Why oh why couldn't this have been a good game? I wanted it to be but really it's like TtR lite. Now I don't mons TtR but as a gamer I don't want anything lighter and that's what quilt show is. There are some interesting elements here but they need to fleshed out more to make the decisions meaningful because as the rules are they are not. Planning is pointless in a game with more than 2 players.  Building larger quilts is fairly pointless as well and there are wayyyy too many awards. It's like one of those games that's wants everyone to feel they're doing well.

The heavy criticisms of this game are simply not fair. This is especially galling given the huge popularity of Ticket to Ride which in some ways is lighter. Quilt Show is certainly deeper than 2p Nordic TtR. This is a light family game with a neat theme. It's not trying to be Patchwork - the deeper Uwe game of the same theme - and shouldn't be judged as if it is. 

I've ultimately decided that I don't need to own this game, but I can recognize this for what it is nonetheless - a great gateway/family game.

Toss up on what to keep, this one or Ticket to Ride. They are both on the same level.  My quilty friends might like this one better so might sell Ticket to Ride.

Ticket to Ride mechanics with a much worse wrapper.  I liked a lot of the core scoring mechanic - choosing to make 1 big quilt, 2 smaller ones, and/or saving tiles for later rounds is interesting.  Unfortunately everything else fell flat - the process of acquiring quilt tiles is simply too slow with too few interesting choices.

I heard a lot of praise for this game.  I was under the impression that it was a slightly more strategic Ticket to Ride, but I was incredibly bored.  I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt not giving it the score I really think it deserves until I play it with more than 2.

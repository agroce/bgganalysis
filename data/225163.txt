I appreciated it for the fair number of interesting decisions. You need to do some fairly long term planning to make everything work out well, and going first is a pretty big advantage to make sure you get the tile(s) you want. Also, make sure you take enough thrusters or you'll be SOL later! The second part of the game is when the planning pays off. This is pretty abstract overall though, it could easily be rethemed into basically anything else. Also, that's mostly a big empty box. Don't need to own.

Very similar to Asara, but must less dynamic. The 5 rounds of loading up is tedious and gets very repetitive. 
Than bam, you have to unload.

With Asara available, there would be no reason to play Reworld.

Played the game at Essen and really enjoyed the different phases of the game. There is a nice mix of strategic and tactical game play. Plays a lot better at 4 player count.

[110] I like the sort of puzzles this game presents, and the drafting mechanism is quite clever, but think I would enjoy the load-unload problem-solving more in a shorter game.

For me it was the best game at Spiel '17. Very well crafted heavy euro where You have to plan your moves at very begging of game.

Structurally, Reworld is a very simple game: Collect some equipment for your space ship and transfer it over to the planet to score points. The major problem for the first game is that those two phases are entirely distinct, and the scoring part will begin only after you have finished the collecting, ie. there is no way to retroactively fix the mistakes you made in the first phase at that point, and without having a clear picture of what the scoring looks like, mistakes are bound to happen. Therefore, you need to understand the niggly details right from the start. Once you have those down, however, Reworld is a sleek and pleasantly quick affair that still offers some opportunities for blunders.

Uff... nice theme and the Kramer/Kiesling combo does great stuff usually, but not this time... to me the worst game from both authors. The gameplay is bland and boring and feels like it's from the 80`s.

The second part of the game might be somewhat interesting but the overall game for sure is not.

Also, the art is something I would've never expected from Menzel. He can do so much better...!

Disappointing from start to end.

Galaxy Truckers meets Vikings or Galaxy Truckers - The German game version. 

Reworld consists of two distinct halves. The first is a preparation phase where the game is won or lost. In the second half, what was build up in the first half is played out. The theme is preparing transport ships to settle a planet. The structure and the theme reminds of Chvatil's game. Instead of a real-time frenzy, Reworld is a more sedate game of hand management, indirect competition of getting something first and correctly programming your batches.

Setting up the ship and unloading it on the planet is the Vikings part. The structure of five lanes in which the different acquired tiles have to be arranged is clearly inspired by Kiesling's previous work. The scoring consists of a conventional game of endgame majorities coupled with points gained during the buildup phase and various achievements awarded during landing.

A pleasant game. Not exactly inspired but it plays out smoothly and has interesting decisions. The main weakness is the repetitive buildup phase with five similar rounds. 90 minutes with four players is a bit long.

I had fun playing my first game, building a spaceship that was very challenging to land efficiently. The winner of that game just built a ship where every row just contained a single type of component. For my second game I tried that; turned out to be pretty easy to do, extremely effective, and totally removed any decisions from the second phase of the game. (Which you'd want to be the place where people scramble after things go wrong).

Still want to play one more time, but rating more likely to go down than up.

Elég erős trió a Kramer, Kiesling, Menzel. Az utóbbinak imádom a stílusát, de sajnos most itt nem érzem magával ragadónak a látványt. Sőt, elég jellegtelennek mondanám. Szerencsére maga a játékmechanika mégis látványos, érdekes, ahogy az űrhajónk bal oldala épül, és a játék második felében pedig onnan építünk. Elég egyedinek érzem, de inkább logikai feladvány az egész, amit párhuzamosan próbálunk minél jobban megoldani. Ennek kicsit ellentmond, hogy eléggé hatással vagyunk egymás akcióra mind a modulok elvitelénél, mind az építkezésnél. Nagyon érdekes játék, eléggé tetszik. :)

FIRST IMPRESSION:

One must keep in mind the objectives and which ones you are pursuing as you complete phase one where you are acquiring tiles. Note that the cards may not always cooperate although you can use any two cards as a wild which sometimes will help. Looking forward to another play as the first one was mostly learning the game.

Das Spiel läuft in 2 Phasen. In der ersten kauft man sich unter viel Interaktion Module und läd sie in den Kofferreum ein. In der zweiten Phase wird der Kofferraum anders herum geleert und man erhält Punkte je nach Geschick auf Phase 1.
Hat mir sehr gut gefallen und mich an Otys erinnert. Sehr starkes Planspiel, aber nicht soooo überladen wie Otys. Genau richtig.

J'adore d'habitude les jeux de ce célèbre duo d'auteurs, mais j'avoue que celui-ci est bien trop tarabiscoté : les implications de nos actions sont incompréhensibles lors de la lecture des règles, et ne se révèlent qu'à la fin de la première partie. De plus, les règles sont longues à expliquer (bien qu'elles ne soient pas bien compliquées au final). Et enfin, l'édition est clairement mal fichier : mauvaise visibilité, choix éditoriaux discutables. Bref, c'est un beau ratage.

This game was a bit dry. It was also difficult to read the tiles. The placement mechanism on the planet was similar to Vikings and Hawaii, but those games are better. On the other hand the tile selection and docking in reverse order in this game was interesting.

Plenty to like here... The game is divided into two distinct phases... The first a tile drafting phase with some nice potential blocking and planning... The second, essentially an elongated scoring phase/race in which players place said tiles into a tableau. There are many ways to score, but most of them only award the first player to accomplish them, so planning a perfect system might not be the best route to victory. The graphic design (shockingly from Menzel) is somewhat bland and inefficient, with much of the important game information relegated to small details on the tiles. Vaguely recalls Vikings.

Really difficult to explain this one since you spend half a game preparing and then the other half "reaping the fruits" so it's really hard to plan anything when you don't really know what that is going to translate into. It's one of those games you really need to play once to fully grasp and specially to get a good idea of how to start your first round entirely.

Once you overcame that hurdle, it really improves and it's all about timings and keeping a look at your opponent's plans. Very good fun this one.

Good game that seems to be destined to stay under the radar. What certainly doesn't help this game is the quite dark color scheme which can give you a sort of instant depression by looking at it. The more vivid color scheme used in Galaxy Trucker (as this game sort of reminds me of that one) could have helped in getting more attention.

RATING: 8
I think this a considerably better game than some people seem to rate it. While not one of Kramer's and Kiesling's very best designs, it nonetheless has their usual hallmark of smooth gameplay and good, meaty strategy and tactics. Sure, it does require a certain amount of tricky forward planning and organisation, but I at least find that fun. The drafting in the first part of the game works really well and the deployment in the second part, while not perhaps as enjoyable, is still engaging and plays out much more quickly. This is obviously not to everybody's taste but I really like it.

Terrible cover. The card placement, sort of interesting to load the ship. The whole colonizing of the planet was less interesting and sort of like an after thought in how can we score points this game. Really just didn't work for me.

RATING: 7
In this game, players are grabbing spaceship parts in the first half, attaching those parts to your ship board, then in the second half of the game, players deploy those gotten tiles from the outside in, into their tableau racing for various firsties bonuses. The tile selection phase is extremely compelling because you do multiple rounds where as players play cards to collect tiles, then the requirements to get other tiles tighten based on the number value of adjacent cards. On top of that, the tile you take clicks into the matching numbered spaceship dock, so you need to be really considering what order you'll be taking the thing apart in, throughout the process of claiming tiles.

I also really appreciated that the second half of the game is a phase where your entire focus can be on claiming first to accomplish x or y tiles. I often get frustrated when games use this mechanism as a way to reward players who are already doing well or as a way to distract you from building your setup. Since here it comes during a dismantle process it feels much more interesting.

One thing however is that the game doesn't appear to have many elements that would result in a varied experience across multiple plays. I don't want to say it has low replayability value because the core experience is enjoyable and I do want to revisit it and see if I can do even better, but if you need any substantial variety in your games I'd say play your friend's copy once, enjoy yourself and then move on with your life. I'll personally likely be struggling to get this back to the table with people who played before for years to come.

wow, the two halves of the game are great, but i really dislike having *all* of the different scoring metrics appear in every game!  would rather that each time you play, different goals are values more or less to have more variability.

tl;dr: interesting planning game

This game is all about planning and timing! What cards do you use to acquire what tiles when. The order in which you acquire them, impacts the order in which you get to play them during the final phase. So constantly you're puzzling together possible combinations for an efficient last phase. Good planning will be rewarded not only with good points, but also bonus points for doing certain things before anyone else.
This game can probably be very AP inducing for certain types of players. My group didn't suffer from that and the game played quite quickly. The result was that all of us quite enjoyed this.
With the variety of tiles, I also look forward to trying a number of different strategies.

Initial rating: 7/10

I’ve had the chance to play Reword twice now and my first impression is favorable. I want to play it again, to see if I can do better, and to see if the speed of the game improves with multiple plays without getting repetitive. It’s an AP nightmare on the first play (or four) because of the fact it’s actually a game in two acts, similar to Galaxy Trucker, where the first half of the game completely decides your success or failure in the second half.

I must say that, after reading other people’s comments and watching and reading some of the reviews, I was beginning to have a little remorse over adding this to my Christmas wish list. But, after playing it, WOW! What a game! I loved it! I didn’t care for attacking other players, because you don’t really get much for doing so, but attacking the aliens is very rewarding! Also, developing technologies and settling planets all goes together really well and provides many ways to score victory points . I really love the synergy of the cards and also the races. This is a game that I keep thinking about and wanting to play again.

Very interesting 4x game, where gameplay went pretty smoothly once rules were understood or agreed upon.  Rulebook kinda sucks, but game is fun.  Has some elements and cards that only work if you know how they work, which is not good for new players.  Experienced players already have advantages, no need to compound the gap.

The more the time goes by, the more I realize that big box card games represent my favorite style of games. Titles like Seasons, Imperial Settlers and Mystic Vale are all great examples of games that kept me bringing them to the table over and over again - to the point of being almost addicted. So, naturally, Alien Artifact is a game that immediately caught my eye when it was announced...

... and, when I played it, the game didn't not disappoint me, just as I expected. This is a fantastic title and one that I can see - with time - becoming an all-time favorite of mine.

The visual presentation of the game is excellent. The artwork and the color choices are very particular but it all goes extremely well together. In particular I really like the artwork for the different races. It always makes me go: "Oh, look at that guy! I want to play that!"... and, being a huge Halo fan, my favorite faction is the Star Union, because the guy looks like Master Chief!

Yet, if the artwork is great, the game-play is even better. Yes, the turns are super fast! Even with high number of players. The choices are also very interesting, because every card has two sides... and you want both of them! So, during the course of the game, you find yourself thinking: How do I build my engine this time? Do I go with the logistic side to get discounts or is it better to choose the operational side and rely less on drawing from the Resource Deck? When do I stop making my engine more efficient and start working on getting Victory Points? This is all great for me!

I also like the fact that the interaction between players largely depends on the people you're playing with. I've seen groups that attacked each other relentlessly, covering each other's tech cards with piles of Blockade Tokens. At the same time, I've seen players very politely choosing to attack the aliens every single time. This makes the game adaptable to different play-styles. I personally enjoy attacking other players, if I know they don't mind conflict in games. Instead, when I play with people that don't like this kind of interaction, the game allows me to play a more friendly game. This is also fantastic for me!

That's why I like Alien Artifacts so much. It's a great game with a lot of interesting choices, that plays quickly and adapts very well to the taste of different groups. A brilliant design that I can't wait to see expanded. I'm very curious to see what this system can do and where it can go. Alien Artifacts is another hit from Portal Games for me. Awesome game!

RATING: 7
Alien Artifacts shows its debt to 51st State in its three row card tableau and the use of resources to pay for card placement. Then there are the distinct ways each card can be used.  In Alien Artifacts this boils down to making the card operational to attack aliens or opponents (ships), score vps (technologies) or provide resource cards (planets); or use its reverse side for things beneficial to building your tableau. It replaces 51st State's resource chits with cards that also serve to resolve combats and checks whether a particular technology scores, and whose deck operates as a game clock. A hand of just three resource cards and normally being allowed to use just two in a turn keeps the player turns fast.  I do have a couple of reservations.  The first is with combat that is risky and inefficient in terms of building your tableau.  The second is about replayability; there doesn't seem the significant variation in cards needed to support radically different strategies.

The artwork is functional and production quality is good.

Uses similar mechanics to Imperial Settlers and 51 States however theme doesn’t come through anywhere near as well and some of the mechanics can lead into very monotonous gameplay loops. I was intrigued by the 4x idea in around an hour but was seriously disappointed.

A card game with no dice but depends so much on lucks :| so if you play agressive toward the aliens bot (which seems like the best way to get points too win compared to exploring planets and developing technology for points combo) and you got lucky, no one can beat you.

Turns are basically counting Numbers and doing one tiny, short action. Only Combat is a little More interesting because you get to draw another Card and eventually get victory Points or alien artifacts. Rest of the game is downtime. Luck can be important to get good synergies and the recources you need. Faction matters for gameplay. Clone faction turned Out to be very boring while Others where fighting and having fun. Rulebook is a catastrophe. Couldn't have played the game without watch it played video. This was the First game so might need another try but I'm not very excited to Play again.

I've only played once, with my wife. And we liked the game well enough but there were a few things we disliked.
1) The game is dull and lacks excitement. We realize this is a card drafting game with engine building but the excitement just wasn't there. 
2) The rule book is adequate but it's not in any way comprehensive. You must Google things up or ask here on BGG. I suppose that criticism could apply to most games.
3) there are cards which are pretty obtuse. You have to read and re-read and still it won't make sense. Better writing was needed.
4) we found out, late game that attacking aliens was a sure fire way to get those points you need. We were in mid game and hadn't moved from the beginning "0" in the score tracker. It's hard to get points or not clear how to use the operational tech to score.
5) attacking other players is a means to and end. You attack them because you wish to blockade them. Keep them from using their bonuses. There is no real threat to them. Just an annoyance.

We left the game scratching our heads and thinking there might be a good game here but it needs something more. I'm hoping that the new expansion will add that.
The same way Eminent Domain improved upon the base game with it's expansion. However truth be told, the base game of Eminent Domain had a much higher fun factor than Alien Artifacts.

I might change my rating after more playthroughs,  the thing is this game didn't leave me wanting to play more.

The game is just bad. I would play 51 first state, race for the galaxy emininent domain, core worlds, or any game of its type over it. The game has to much randomness and overstay its welcome. There is very little strategy and the game is more tactical do to the randomness. The worst part is the low amount of artwork. All alien artefacts share the same image...

Played at Spiel '17. An okay tableau builder with tame base cards and overpowered 'rare' artifact cards. There's a bit of player interaction that provokes bash the leader by attacking a player, but the effect is pretty mild. It's a pretty looking game that can be played quickly, I guess, when you know the cards a bit. My game however dragged on and on because of really bad explanation and two players who didn't get a feel for the game. It was told to be a 4X game, but I think that's stretching the definition.

Interesting (and quick) card game giving a bit of a feel of a 4x game.

You spend '5' resources (of differing types) for most actions so it's easy to pick up. Play cards on the left side (build queue) then pay resources to develop them moving to the right. At that point you decide is it to be operational (dark side) or logistics (light side) both do different things.

Not perfect though 
- card translation is a bit off (use of comma's instead of 'and' for example) leading to confusion on cards, especially the operational side of the technology cards (the ones that score).
- need to thoroughly shuffle the resource deck otherwise it clumps, as you're always looking to turn in pairs, if you don't randomise it enough then 2nd and subsequent cycle you get to draw pairs ... two discard piles help.
- combat is a bit 'meh' 
- getting a good combo of techs is probably the best way to win, of course that's luck of the draw and then the skill to spot it, but some might find it too random for their tastes.

Overall, like it alot - but could see some eurogamers hating the luck of the resource draw, luck of the artifacts draw, luck of the combat draw and luck of the triggering VP draw too much.

This is not a 4X game! This is a multiplayer solitaire engine building game with a thinly painted on 4X theme. Having cards with four suits named explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate does not a 4X make. It's got pretty pictures of implausible looking space ships though, I'll give it that.

Can't say that this game clicked with me, did sound like a fun game, but actual playing wasn't.

Felt like I was spending a lot of turns to accomplish very little. Especially if you go for the titular Alien Artifacts route--you can sink a lot of turns into something that never pays off and there is no way to know ahead of time. 

Player interaction feels bad all around. It's not fun to attack because you don't get anything except for hurting your opponent. It's not fun to defend because you basically get -1 to your hand size, limiting your other options in the game. And it's not like you can tell when someone is about to attack you, so preemptive defense feels like a losing strategy.

On a positive note, turns are fast and there are a lot of small engines to build, a lot of different strategies to pursue. The core mechanisms of building your empire are fun, but the game as a whole feels slow even if turns are fast. I think this is because not a lot happens on your turn and your empire doesn't change that much from turn to turn.

I love tableau/engine builders and I was really excited about this one. Unfortunately, the game feels like a prototype to me. I have faith that just like with 51st State, Portal will "fix" this game eventually. As is, I'm kind of let down by a few of the games rules and interactions. 

Even with some of my complaints I still like the game but I can feel that it could be so much more. We shall see.

After a couple of plays, the similarity to Imperial Settlers and 51st State is quite evident.  This game replaces resources in those games with a card deck.  The 4X theme is mostly there.  Kind of.    Red cards give points for attacking, blue gives points for building to certain goals, and green gives discounts or extra resources.   What is really nice here is how fast the game moves.   Like Imperial Settlers, you are just taking micro-actions, so turns should totally cruise around the table.   The art is good for the most part, and feels very video-gamey.   There is some inconsistent language, spelling, and icon usage (or lack of icons) on the cards.   It doesn't make the game unplayable or anything bad like that, but it is sloppy work and makes the game feel rushed.   There are some real clarity issues in the English rulebook, apparently.   I've been taught different rules each time that I've played so far.    Minor quibbles, though, this is still a really solid game.

TRADED IT! (for Gold West)

I bought this at the same time as Master of Orion, and while both games are OK, this one was just a bit clunkier (the extra layer of managing resource cards to build the cards is just unnecessary). Both game are quite straight forward and rely on the cards to chain into better cards (with cost reduction or scoring arcs). Alien Artifacts tries to go a bit further with a combat system that feels very tacked on. The art and design is fantastic, though the layout suffers at time by trying to be too clever (dovens of picto references begin to undermine their simplicity).

In the end the game is close to being very good, but falls short by trying to encompass the flavor of the 4X's.

Alien Artifacts is a 4X-style card game in which you play as an interplanetary faction, sending your research vessels into uncharted space to expand your knowledge and power. Build powerful ships, develop new technologies, and explore distant planets for anything — or anyone — you can exploit.

Alien Artifacts is built on a Resource engine - each turn you will have 3 Resource cards in your hand and you will decide how best to spend them. Each resource card has two different resource types for you to use. You can only use one side and only two cards per turn! Using these resources, you will build Ships, develop Technology, discover Planets, or Trade for currency!

New Ships allow you to attack the aliens and gain their valuable artifacts which provide huge bonuses.
With each new Technology card in your Empire, you will have access to more actions, bonuses, and scoring opportunities.
Each Planet you explore provides valuable resources for future actions.

There are two sides to each of these cards, and as you build them you will decide:
Logistics - play cards on this side to gain ongoing bonuses that will make your Empire stronger and help you build faster.
Operational - play this side to gain a new way to score victory points (and yes, you will be able to activate your operations more than once, if you play well).

Manage your Resources, build the right cards, make wise choices. Win!

Alien Artifacts provides a true 4X experience in under an hour. With over two hundred cards, Alien Artifacts offers players many scoring strategies and great replay-ability.

[b]The theme[/b]: Space exploration, combat and developing of technologies - what theme is better than this one? Not one! It also feels really there when you play - you buy cards to build, develop and discover, but first, you need to pay for them. Techs, ships, planets, all need different resources to add to your empire. Ships are used to attack (or you can just get a new ability off them), techs can give you new ability or a new way of scoring. And planets can give you discounts on anything or you can exploit them to give you resources for free. 

[b]The visuals[/b]: The game is beautiful. All white and popping. The iconography is very clear and the cards have nice quality.

[b]The gameplay[/b]: The gameplay is super fast. Everyone just does one action and that's all. The actions are also fast and you usually have multiple actions planned so you don't need to think about what to do on your turn but you manage to do it while other people go. The engine building is very prevalent in the game, as well, so that is great. You can basically build any kind of engine you'd like and there are many, many ways to victory which is always great.

[b]The fun[/b]: The fun level is very high. You play super fast, you can attack each other, you constantly need to think about what can give you most points.

A somewhat attacky Tableau-builder that features risk mitigation and resource management. Techs and Artifacts add some nice variability, and are complemented well by the core set of planet and ship abilities that all players have general access to throughout the game. I look forward to exploring more of this.

I was surprised by how much I actually enjoyed this one. I don't agree with the 4x tag this has been given as it is more of an engine builder and an hours play time seems about right.

Its actually a very simple card game with quite a bit going on. I think the limit of 2 cards is a bit weak, especially when you have a hand of 3 and want to use them all, but I can see what they were trying to do. 
The double sided cards are nice and offer different ways to play the same thing, do you build a defense fleet or attacking warships, technological boons to assist your actions or victory point farms for end game?

Rule book is not good and it took the hubby two attempts to read through it to be able to understand how to play. 

The 'alien artifact cards' that the rulebook warns you about how powerful they are felt like a damp squib, didn't really do much and it would have been better to plough resources elsewhere.

being able to hold +1 card over everyone else is a HUGE game breaking power in this game. I'm guessing the people who playtested this game didn't get this tech very often?

As a fan of resource-engine games like Race For The Galaxy and 51st State, my impressions were positive after one play. I'm not sure Alien Artifacts is as precisely balanced as either of those other games, but it is fun to play and I am intrigued to learn all the ins and outs of this one, and to see what kinds of strategies emerge. With cards in your build queue and in deployment (and with those that are deployed in one of two states) it is difficult to tell at-a-glance everything that is going on in your empire, but this will improve with familiarity. Thematically I don't think this is quite as strong as RFtG or 51st State, despite the faction sheets, but maybe the theme will better reveal itself over time. The artifacts feel swingy (which relates to that balance observation), but I'm not an especially competitive player so I kind of like the boom/bust nature of an artifact draw. I also liked the battle system ... you build your fleet ship-by-ship, and can go raiding as each ship is launched, and/or save them up for a big mass attack against either the aliens or another player. But your fleet doesn't directly defend your own system -- it serves as a deterrent force by threatening retaliation, but defense of your empire, however vast, is dependent on defense cards. The feeling is one of holding a vast frontier, with little pin-pricks all across the empire from raiders, and the occasional bit of bad business when a fleet strikes you in earnest. Will play again!

I got to play the prototype at UK Games Expo.

Sci-fi game where you conquer planets, build a fleet and develop technologies. I really enjoyed the resource system, where you mix the half of two cards. I also like the fact you don't have to pay for all the (rising) costs right away, meaning you can drip resources on them if there's nothing better you can do.

With one action per turn the turns go quickly so the game is quick if everyone knows how to play. 

I got the feeling there wasn't a lot of player interaction, but I don't consider that a problem.

There are some aspects I didn't get to explore so I'd love to play it again.
Can't wait to see how it turns out, especially the different alien races.

First play I thought it was 'okay' but second play and its really grown on me.  
Good: rule book pretty clear, box is actually designed to hold the components in an efficient way, set up and tear down are very fast, fast-playing, able to plan a bit ahead but also at the mercy of card draw so its a bit strategic, more tactical and somewhat luck-driven.  Pretty low AP.  Great at 2P. 

J is actually looking forward to playing it again so that's the main thing.

It feels a bit more satisfying than Imperial Settlers.  I would say Race for the Galaxy is still the best.

It will be the last portal game to be bough ever. All the portal games share the same kind of problems, a very badly edited rulebook. The most important part do no have a compendium or an explanation of some cards and the players must guests some of the rules . The artwork is.... completely missing. No interaction between players or at least it makes no sense to attack the other players. It is not a 4x, it is a 4xfraud.

RATING: 9
This game is absolutely amazing and incredibly deep and at the same time plays incredibly fast. It also rightly so deserves the 4X label - even though most will not consider a card game to ever be a „true“ 4X game. This game however pulls it off in amazingly subtle ways. You can certainly recognize parallels to 51st State and Imperial Settlers, however this one feels much more advanced. Multi-Use cards, every decision has to be considered how to expand your empire and how to actually score points in the end or go for immediate points during the turns... I love it and hope for many expansions just like Imperial Settlers has been kept fresh. This one certainly deserves it.

Alien Artificacts is a card based engine building game. That's it. Nothing more, nothing less. If that's what you are looking for, it probably does this quite well. But don't expect too much theme going in.

RATING: 8
Portal knows how to make cardbased engine builders.
This one is more forgiving while still offering tough choices. Plays fast and a really fun time.

Though I'm not a big fan of the rulebook. I was at first since it's nicely structured, is clearly written and very pleasent to go through. But when it comes down to the nitty gritty, the fine rules print... then it's lacking. Blockades are a perfect example of something that really could've used a better writeup.

RATING: 8
There are so many different ways to gain points during the game and at the end, this game provides numerous viable strategies. The game can definitely take much longer than 60 minutes due to the amount of text on the cards as each one changes the rules in some way for the player adding that card to their empire. If you like euro games, give this a try.

(two prototype plays)
The first play was great. Although lacking in the complete 4X experience, which is expected given its length, the game was fun and interactive. Different paths to victory were available and all seemed feasible.
My second play went out to the full 5 "years" (rounds) and wore out its welcome a little. We discovered several imbalances in the prototype cards, many relating to the interactions with each other.
The game is fun and on the right track for a GenCon release in 2017. I have high hopes for it.

Kiváló ötletek vannak benne, szerintem nagyon hangulatosra sikeredett. Kicsit aggódtam, hogy túlságosan Birodalmi telepesek, 51st state érzete lesz, de szerencsére nagyon más, a 3 soros elrendezésen kívül nincs sok hasonlóság.
Nem tudom, hogy kinek mennyire adja vissza a 4x érzetet, lehet, hogy sima engine building, de nem is igazán érdekel, mert jó lett, akárminek is nevezzük. A dizájn is nagyon szuper.
Részemről csak egy baja van, hogy bár nagyon jó, nem kiváló... Ami csak azért gond, mert így nem gyakran kerül asztalra...

terrible manual. Avoid at all costs! Publishers should not be rewarded for crappy manual and laziness.
Watch this:

https://youtu.be/7oQW66_VIz8?t=922

There is no excuse for sloppy rulebooks. 
Reason 1 is that the manual is the soul of a game and it's your moral responsibility to take care of it. As a designer you should have had the humility to ask for proofreading your rules. 
Reason 2 is that you are competing with 1000s of games that do have good manuals.

Designers can fix the issue by posting the rulebook as a word doc on bgg and ask for improvement suggestions. As long as designers don't change their approach, please don't ask me to change my verdict.

+1 for the game idea.

An interesting approach to tableau building. Played it at the prototype stage and it was much more intuitive back then. Something bad happened to it during development. Still keeping my fingers crossed for the authors - there is a lot of potential in the idea, yet this version is very much clouded with weird microrules. AMAZING art.

Okay, so each time I visit the forum I find out another rule that I missed or didn't understand how it worked from the rulebook. I would highly encourage reading through the forum and watching the video before teaching this game as the rule set is very poorly written. I believe I am finished with early adoption of Portal Games at this point. 

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Enjoyed it but like all card combo games I wish there was a bit more clarity on some of the cards and how they work together. There is a fair bit of randomness in the card draw which hopefully evens out over time. You will learn to despise/curse the "assembly" limit which makes operations challenging at times.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I'm a big fan of tableau builders in general and 51st State in particular, so a new game of that type from Portal definitely got my attention. I thought I'd be able to hold off on pre-ordering it until a bad week had me wanting some retail therapy and there it was.

Our play was probably not optimum. We were learning from the rulebook, which is unclear on a few things. The rules are not as bad as Portal rulebooks have been in the past, but they omit a super-important thing for endgame scoring. There's a lot going on so we had to sort of mentally edit the game down. Once we finished, however, we both wanted to play more and both felt like we had a general grasp of what was going on.

It's a nice 4x game, though it seems light on the combat. Not necessarily a bad thing, but those who see that as a fundamental part will be disappointed. The combat that is there is kind of odd, actually, with parts that I don't really see the point of. 

The other strange thing is that it's called "Alien Artifacts". There are alien artifacts in the game, so that's not a lie, but though they're neat they're not centered in the slightest. I won our game by two or three points, and got two of them. Matt got none. Despite getting them, I didn't feel like I was being driven to do so by the game. It's like calling Settlers of Catan "Longest Road". It's there, and it helps, but there's nothing essential or super special about it.

Artwork is great and there's a lot of flavor to it. I need to play in more depth, but so far so good.

Played at Dice Tower Con. A lot going on in this one to remember, maybe 1 or 2 icons too many.  Almost zero interaction meaning this should be 2 player only.  There is an attacking other players capability (that comes into effect later in the game), but there is little point as you can just attack the aliens instead for better rewards.  I do like some of the mechanics in the game however.  The multi-use cards are clever and provide some interesting choices.  In its current form, not something I would seek out again unfortunately.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A game that overstays its welcome.  The mechanics are okay for what it is and there is some engine building involved. During the game, I've felt that what I drew dictated my strategy as opposed to finding the right tools to do what I want.  What bugged me the most was the numerous symbols and unclear card text that constantly made me pester owner of the game on what they do.  Personally, I would rather stick with Roll for the Galaxy, or for something far more simpler, Master of Orions the card game.

Under-developed game of high luck.  One of the worst rulebooks I have ever seen (played around 1500 different games).  Game is supposedly a 4X game, just feels like another card game with a theme glued on.  The player races are useless, feel tacked on.  The resource deck is a total fail for my group - way, way too random for a 'strategy' game that runs an hour or more.  Go play Imperial Settlers, great game.

I have only played it with 2 players, but I enjoy the way the cards work together. It feels like there are tons of options. Sometimes it is difficult to understand what it is one should be doing at different times throughout the game. I enjoy the "min/maxing" style of play the game pushes for as well. I have not played enough to know how well the characters are balance yet though.

Played it a couple months before release, apparently rules were still in progress. But I really did not like it at all. Game seemed to crawl along with no player interaction. Felt mostly like an abstract card game, figuring out your best combo's. Nothing new, felt like other games out there do this kinda stuff way better. Mechanically it feels a bit like Imperial Settlers, a game that I'm not really fond of either.

Maybe the rules will improve before release, but currently I'm not interested in trying this again. Portal games are hit 'n miss for me, this one doesn't feel like it's going to be a hit for me.

First play was mixed (four players) - one player slowed the snappy pace of the game and another got very soured due to the specifics requirements to turn the try and produce VPs from your technologies (Having to have exactly a 3 and a 2 resource without being able to increase your assembly limit and/or use wilds).

Early feedback is I like this game quite a bit.  What holds me back fromk scoring higher is currently personal, but building a strategy has been clunky for me, more so than games like RftG and San Juan.  To be fair I have been focusing on more red and green card deployment than blue, so I may need to adjust my style.  If I see things lick this score is likely to increase.

Played Prototype at BGG twice.  Very cool core game.  There's some glaring issues that would need to be corrected before release. These include:

1) Military actions can either be worthless or incredible based on what technologies you randomly gain. 

2) In general, it's hard to plan any kind of tech tree.  Imagine if you had to try and use every card you get in "race for the galaxy."  There's no good ability to cycle to something that fits your strategy.

3) Military strength ranges from 1 to 30, but the randomize mechanic is only a difference of 3.  So a defender with strength 12 has no chance against an attacker of strength 15. 

4) Rules for one X were different from a different X, making it confusing.  For example, completing a 3rd planet costs +2, and nothing extra to acquire.  Your 3rd tech costs +2 to acquire, and +4 to complete.

5) There's a lot in the game currently, and it should be fast paced, so some erroneous mechanics should be pruned down. The game should be made more "elegant."

Anyways, it's a tall order for a game released in 9 months, but I'm hopeful they can pull it off and make this amazing! It'd definitely have a place on my shelf!

Played at Essen Spiel. Not an 4X game. Missing the Xterminate aspect since everyone is busy with building their engine, plus attacking the alien card gives a better reward and less risks. 

Did like the resource mechanism and discover/building mechanism a lot. Together with that and dropping the 4X expectation it is a solid card game.

I had very high expectations for this game. Unfortunately for me it feels extremely swingy and luck dependend.
Attacking feels unnessesarely overpowered and yet unrewading at the same time. All you do is draw a card and compare it to a sheet of numbers. Really boring.
Constructing tecs is obsolete if your opponents craps Blockades all over you. Planets are swingy too. Maybe you score Points if you produce, but only maybe.
Seriously Id rather roll a die to determine who the "better" player is.

This is a space card game, where you get a player power, then hope the gods of flipluck grant you cards that work with your starting setup, and or give you ability cards that syngergize with other cards you've gotten. The graphic design is nice enough, the flow of play is ok. It's reasonably fast paced, and I can see how people might like it, but I just felt alternating frustration and boredom with it. For example, my starting setup wanted me to get exploration cards. None came up until halfway through the game. I wound up winning anyway because I just kept digging for what I needed, but the experience of getting there wasn't great. I'd try it again maybe but I don't think I'd ask to play it again.

Has some interesting ideas but ultimately the random generation of resources was far too annoying for me to fully enjoy the game... especially considering that the resources ar also the timer. So if you invest in drawing more resources and get nothing but less than useful resources you also now have less time to accomplish what you actually want to do.

I just played the prototype of this game on a convention in Warsaw, and I must say my expectations are really high.
Even in the prototype version, it was really good. The combat is lacking, but the designer told me this part will be overhauled soon. I want to try the game after that, but even if I wouldn't be able to, I'll probably buy it.
One of the first questions the designer asked me after I'd played it was if the game felt like 4X. ...yeah, kind of, but instead describing it as a card version of Twilight Imperium I'd rather say it feels like space opera version of Through the Ages. Which actually makes me even more excited.
There is one difference though: this game is unbelievably fast-paced. There is almost no downtime, unless you play with a group of a very slow players.
To sum up: I can't wait for it!

Edit after palying the final version: This could be such a good game. My initial excitement went lower and lower as I've been listening to the revised rules, then playing it. It lost its4X epicness somewhere during the development. Pity.

Solid engine builder.  Learned a lot about certain things during the second play-through.  Like realizing that all symbols have essentially the same powers through the decks.  Like all of exploration green cards are always the same.  Still really cool and would like to play more.  At 5 players it might have been a little much, I think 2-3 players will wind up being the sweet spot for this.  But it's fast enough that I don't think it'll matter much.  To truly be good at the game you're going to need to understand what others are doing and I'm not entirely sure i'll get to play it enough to know that, but maybe.  Overall a good game i would be willing to play many more times.

tl;dr: fun engine builder, not a real 4x

This was pitched as a 4x game in 1 hour. When I hear that I'm always skeptical. Even [thing=72125][/thing] which is the closes thing to a short 4x game, isn't a full 4x game if you ask me.
This game also has ships you can build and use to attack other planets and players. It also has a technology development mechanism. It does not have a map though, everything is done through cards.
I quite like the mechanism where you use cards for doing actions. The way it is set up leads to very quick turns and very little downtime. We had players surprised it was their turn again quite a lot.
We didn't finish in 1 hour, with 5 new players sot it did take a bit longer, but it certainly is a fast game and I quite enjoyed playing it. I look forward to playing it again soon.

After one play, This game feels like it has some depth. I enjoyed playing it. I give the game an 8, it feels like a race for the galaxy/dominion hybrid. 

There are some issues though. The rule book gets a solid 3.5. Portal needs to step their game up.

The game is intuitive once you start playing but the rules are convoluted and poorly layed out. Their terrible rule books are bringing down good games.

The game has good art work but some of the cards have errors. 

The player reference card is terrible.

I need to play this game more to get a better feel for it and the gameplay. So far, I like the card play for gathering resources and developing cards. I don't think I like blockades, which can be frustrating, nor the luck of the draw for scoring cards. Also, Technology cards seem to be the way to win with all other methods being extra points, the Artifacts vary in usefulness, and I wish there were more Alien System cards. I feel the luck of the draw plays more of a role than in a game like Race for the Galaxy or Imperial Settlers, both of which seem to give you more options and control.

Alien Artifacts has a few issues — dull combat, bland artistic sensibilities, and none more divisive than its chanciness — but it's ultimately a tight three-row tableau-builder that follows in the footsteps of its predecessors (51st State and Imperial Settlers) while sidestepping the sin of snowballing into a tediously long final round. It's fast, lean, and provides a ton of combo-arranging goodness.

Luck has too much influence and the game seems a bit disjointed from its theme. To few interactions between players for a game that calls itself a 4X.

Horrendous. Worst game of BGGCon 2017. Just turtle and focus on completing 2-3 tech cards for end game points...no one can block you, easily defend weak attacks from other players, go from 0 pts to roughly 45 in final scoring. I doubt the designers tested this strat of ignore 3 of the X's and just play solitaire for the win. Ugh - bad way to wrap up the Con too - it was our last game of the weekend. Boo. :)

A bit opaque for a relatively simple game.  Getting 5 icons on 2 cards frequently seems far too important to winning though.

Such an elegant representation of 4x.  Interesting and complex at four, quick and strategic at two.

Boring :( And feels very luck based.   Faction difference is basically you have different endgame scoring and a different price for the Alien Artifacts.  Really did not enjoy my play of this. Final nail in the coffin was that you have scoring action that is luck-based. In a game where you score around 40-50 points missing out on 3-4 points because you drew an unlucky card, really sucks!  Big pass for me!

This is a well designed game with beautiful art, but it just isn't for me.

First play, like others have said, was pretty messy. We played on a table at our gaming night that was not really big enough to handle it, and it has lots of card-tucking and just general busyness in the iconography. Players had to ask the owner to go into the rulebook many times, and several rules were kind of unclear as we went (and later revealed to be wrong).

All that said, I think there are some interesting synergies and decisions here, but it would take way more plays on this one (like Race for the Galaxy or Roll for the Galaxy) to understand all of the possibilities.

It does overstay its welcome a bit, but I still felt there was some decent decisions and moments. Would likely do better my next play.

Perfection. Really enjoy playing with two players, not bad at 5, but still better for duels. Only thing that should be improved is interaction.

First impressions: OK game. Cannot compete for a place in my collection when I already own Imperial Settlers and Race for the Galaxy. Artwork didn't really grab me. I like how attacking aliens seems a valid strategy compared to creating some kind of points engine. However, generating a points engine seems to be a more reliable way to gain points, whereas more randomness is involved when dealing with aliens. Attack players in a 3 or 4 player game doesn't really seem worth it, but might be required to slow down a person who is ahead of the pack. Multi-purpose cards are okey; Didn't add nor subtract from the fun to me.

One thing I really didn't like, is that you tend to completely focus only on your thing and haver very little interaction with the other players involved.

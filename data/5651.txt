A fantastic game with simple rules to drive the game along nicely. The divisional boundary, the different units within each unit, the front lines forming when units clashes are fantastic sight to behold on the map.

It's slightly let down by the time consuming efforts to set up and time taken to battle along the whole frontline.

Longest day indeed.

Best game on the subject. Most excellent in team play even if German infantry can't do much : low attack, low defense and low movement. British artillery if used correctly can destroy anything, so the German player must always move his Panzer divisions to avoid annihilation. The terrain on the US side is difficult and prevents high mobility. Moreover the US armoured divisions don't come too early. But if the German concentrate on the US, he lets the British totally free to move as he wants.

Never thought I'd own this, but then...
My buddy and wife show up at our party game group meeting, and he hauls out four games.  They had just been at a garage sale, last buyers, when the seller asks if they want some games.  They were just going to take them to Goodwill, but offered them to my friends gratis.  My buddy knows I collect games, so he says, "Sure."  All are marked $3.  I pass on Split Second (not interested) and Scotland Yard (already own), grab Axis & Allies for another buddy, and then go weak in the knees when he shows me...The Longest Day.  I clutch it, and he is curious as to why I'm showing some emotion.  Much to his credit, he's still willing to part with it when I tell him what this game is going for on ebay.  He participates in party games for social reasons, but has little interest in war or strategy games.  I bless him and give him $10 just to put my mind at ease.  The gift/buy of the gaming century.  Will rate upon playing.  [Garage sale $10*]

RATING: 8.5
One of my very short list of all-time keepers--I love this game, even though…  Dated, massive numbers of counters to manage, hard-to-read counters, too many huge pacs, but what the heck.  Straightforward, immersive, and pretty simple system with a great rule book--all of the complexity is on the board, not trying to parse out overly-complicated mechanics.  The two things that knock down the rating are, 1) the nightmare campaign set-up takes forever, and--mostly--2) that it needs more/smaller scenarios--the British beaches, the American beaches, Caen, Goodwood, etc…  I've almost never had the unlimited space required to lay the game out in all its glory to play over the weeks and months it is going to take--but those few times over thirty years that I have were amazing!

This is a monster game I have really enjoyed playing for decades. I've played it regularly and came back to it several times. The fun is in the scale, and in the possibilities for team play. As the basic playing units are battalions or companies, all grouped into divisions requiring to supply subordinated units, the game invites teamplay. We always had more discussions about the division of supplies than about strategy!
Another thing I really like about this game is that the German defenders get a good share of activity. Instead of attacking it is always possible to use defensive fire to damage the enemy. In The Battle for Normandy you have to be way more careful with defensive fire, because of the option for the Allies to use counter battery fire. 
There is a drawback to The Longest Day though, and that is that the initial invasion turns are VERY much impacting how the game will progress, and what chances the Allies will have to end the game successfully. We therefore adapted the landing rules as suggested in some articles in wargames magazines to target invading units rather than whole stacks. That gave a more balanced result. 
Still, I do think fondly of all the hours spent playing this game, and would not hesitate to begin a new game!

Gee, I'm the first to actually comment on this Monster?  It is truly that...a monster. Imagine playing the entire Normandy campaign at the battalion level.  Bingo.   When I played almost the entire game, we set it up in a guys basement on an 8' x 6' table and had card tables used for unit organization. It looked like a freaking war room, which was cool in itself. There were 6 of us playing and I had Utah beach.  I became so involved in my own sector, I had ask at the end of the night what happened in the other sectors, cause I didn't have time to check them out during the game.   It took us months of play, playing once a week to ALMOST finish the game.  Would I do it again?  Sure, if you could find anyone that committed to play.  Overall, it's solid easy rules, tons of pieces, looks good and plays well. I would have rated it higher when I played it years ago, but it's down to an 8 now.  It deserves an 8 just for the size AND the experience if you can get it.   Out of print now for quite a few years, going for big prices on Ebay.  Doubt if I will ever own a copy because of this.  This is a man's wargame, you better be serious if you are ready to play this behemoth!

In my last wargaming club at IU, we attempted this. We had a blast! Adequate supply is at least important as strong combat factors and odds in developing and maintaining an offensive drive. Any serious wargmaing club would find a serious attempt at playing this game over the course of year rewarding and enlightening.

Old classic with a campaign that takes forever to play but leaves you with a rewarding gaming experience. The rules leave quite a lot to wish for but the unofficial 2nd ed. rulebook fixes most of the problems with the original.

Rules look quite streamlined but AH presentation is not great. Looks quite close to The Gamers SCS and it may be interesting to do a port to SCS rules base. Interesting that ZoCs really only come from being on hills or fortifications. Nice. Still haven't mastered the supply rules. Air power seems a bit weak for the effort involved.

On the one hand, this is a facinating early monster game - very manageable rules (only 12 pages!) and a great, strangely under-gamed campaign. OTOH, this is still a massive game that takes forever, and you have to wonder whether you get similar play value out of Breakout: Normandy for a fraction of the investment. NES recent The Killing Ground is a similar game that is more complex and yet somehow a little less fiddly. It also does not cover the landings & first two weeks, so it's not directly analogous.

This is just a wonderful game. It's a friendly monster with stepped based rules that are slowly feed to players as they progress through the scenarios. Counters are pretty nice looking. Played two scenarios so far it's interesting but slow work setting everything up alone but fun when the game starts.

A brutal monster game. A group of us played the first four or five turns of the campaign over the period of a month before calling it quits. It's a bit confusing, especially with the counter art, but once you get the hang of it, it's good. I'd like to give a short scenario a try.

I've played this game one on one and solitaire.  I love the divisional feel of the game, the war of attrition with exciting occassional breaks, the way you have to save your supply up and then blow it in a big push, the amount you learn about the forces involved.

I know its a monster, I know its not for everyone, but I like it.

My complaint is I find the invasion and logistic rules poor.  The allies just can't land men as fast as they did in real life... this game is slanted towards the Germans IMO

My friends and I call this monster game: "The longest game".
The most detail game I saw about D-Day and the Normandy campaign.
Very detailed OOB, beautiful components for a 1980 game.
Huge rules book but if you play the shorter scenarios, you can skip about 40% of the rules.(Shorter don't mean short here, they are BIG ones). 
I have played three or four scenarios and it was a great experience.

RATING: 4
   The high point of Germanophilism in wargame design.  You know, the Germans were superstuds who did everything right, and both the Soviets and the Wallies only won because they could throw two or three men into the fight for every Landser. A German unit takes a hit in TLD, it loses 25% of its strength, but an Allied loses more than half as those dumb GIs/Tommies impale themselves on MG34s.   Particularly hated the "Gen. Burnside" river crossing rules for rather small Norman rivers.  I wanted it so badly when it was $60, some years later bought it for $25 and still felt ripped off.

Great game though the artillery rules where a bit wonky.  Loved the way the allies had to plan days in advance what to drop on the beaches. 

The German style units where a really nice touch.

Also, the game was heavilly unbalanced in favore of the Allies ... which perhaps is realisitc.

Avalon Hill's only real 'monster' game.

I've never had the entire game set up and have only played two of the scenarios.  I can't imagine what the counter stacks in the main game would be like because the scenarios can break into 5 or 6 high... and there is no stacking limit.

A game for the true collector only.

Couple of things I like: The supply and command system encourage historical play. The attritional combat system captures the bocage fighting

A monster, but a rather playable monster.  Some of the scenarios are quite good.  The campaign game suffers from a lack of balance.  The allies have a clear view of German units, which gives the attackers a tremendous advantage.  Some fog of war would make the game better.

I played a campaign once with 5-6 per side, double blind, and refereed.  Fog of war was implemented and it was fabulous.  One of my favorite gaming experiences ever.  It&#039;s a 10 played that way.

Wonderful game of the Normandy campaign. Many scenarios, great depth of detail yet a simple game system. Big footprint and takes a long while to play the campaign but an accurate and exciting game and simulation.
The Germans have to attack to slow the Allies but will become increasingly brittle and will ultimately get smashed by awesome Allied firepower.

Another classic case of what went wrong with the wargame hobby in the late 1970s/early 1980s.  In an era before email, computer art software, on-line playtest groups, etc., you would think that logic would dictate games be small and simple.  But just the opposite reigned.  The results were, if not travesties of conflict simulation, incredibly ill-conceived and bad products.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
There are certainly criticisms to be made of this game, but it also gives as much insight to the campaign as just about any other game. I actually played this one to completion several times solitaire when I was a teenager, and played a game against a friend in college,although we never finished. I love the supply rules,and the scale is perfect. It's hard to imagine putting in the work to play something like this now, though. Breakout: Normandy is less detailed, but more fun to play against an opponent. '8' may be a little high, because I really doubt I ever play this again, but I played this so much when I was a teenager...fond memories.

Edit: changed this to a 5 just to make it more in line with BGG's rating system. Even so, when I was playing this solitaire a lot in the early '80s, I would have rated it a 10. Just too much work for me nowadays. My copy of the game almost looks like it went through the Normandy campaign, it is so weathered.

Edit: One more comment, after playing a few more Normandy games, one more thing in TLD's favor is that it seems to get the pace of the Allied advance pretty much 'right'. I think using battalion sized elements (mostly), along with the step reduction is the right way to go in showing the highly attritional nature of this campaign. No other game I've played gets the feel quite the same as this one. I still doubt I ever play it again, but I'd be willing if someone wanted to set it up and keep it set up somewhere. If nothing else, I'll always have my vivid memories playing it.

A nice Normandy game that captures well the unpredictability of the early landings and the chaos of the opening days. Takes more forward planning as the Allies and for the Germans the pain is over much faster than other more recent monster games on the topic.

Bought this for £100 ($210 US at the time) on e-bay in 2005, always wanted it ever since it was a feature in my local hobby shop when I was a kid (i.e. they couldn't sell it and I couldn't afford it). My second hand copy came with two sets of mapboards and an extra set of all the counters that start on Board (so presumably there's someone somewhere with the remaining counters?). Played a two player landing scenario, a few  solo scenarios and a solo campaign game. Like it a lot. Rules are simple but elegant. Detail is insane and unit symbols a pain until you get used to them. Have done my own colour coded counters with little pictures on (Like those in Borodino) which makes the game easier to play.  Can't work out why US Shermans are better than British ones though, the Brits (& Canucks, poles etc) used Fireflys, the Yanks didn't. Badly misnamed - lasts a lot longer than a day.  For my campaign game I Switched ends, Brits landed at Utah and Gold, Canucks at Omaha and Yanks at Sword and Juno.  Yanks broke out via Falaise on 22 July (moved Two SS divisions just too late to prevent this).

To call this a game is ridiculous.  It is an event.  To just set up this map is awe inspiring in its size.  It is so detailed, each of the armor units list what type of vehicles are in the unit, and how many.  On a battalion scale!  The scope of this game is mind boggling.  The size is also a drawback, in it is hard to finish this MONSTER.  If a game ever cried out for a cyberboard, this would be one.

If you want realism, and have at least one more willing player, you wont find any better than this.  This is as close to real as it gets, right down to the smallest detail.  I have played the complete campaign once, as the Germans, and had a blast.  The best part is using the beach guns and the mortars to blast landing boats as they arrive.  Its not uncommon to kill the entire occupants of a landing boat with one well placed mortar shell.  This is the ultimate game if you have a games room, and like to think about war strategy.  There will never be another game quite like "The Longest Day", and the going price reflects it.

Monstrous game that will take up a room in your house when set up. Set ups will be several hours and I don't think I have ever finished a scenario (maybe one). Practically impossible to find people to play this with anymore as games will last days or weeks for the campaign. Because of number of roles, several players can play, unlike most wargames (one player in charge of British, another US, another German, and can be further divided into air force, navy, etc).  Difference from most other games is that it is very important to maintain supply lines, hence the importance of roads, train lines, etc.) Very difficult to bring to table, but a fascinating experience if you are into this kind of thing).

Similar to Atlantic Wall, the landings were the fun part of the game.  The artillery was dominant for the Allies.  Could never quite get past the symbols on the counters though.  Don't think Avalon Hill used those symbols again on any release.  Quite possibly the largest mounted mapboard ever.  I can't imagine how much a game like this would have cost if it had been released in the 21st century!  A real collector's item.

Very long first turn. Second,third,fourth, But it is without a doubt on of the funest of big games,IMHO. Very good game. My biggest problem is the size, actually the width of the board. The dog leg map makes it hard to fit a normal table. You need 5 feet by at least 6 feet. So you have room for order of battle and charts. Longer would be better. I just wish they would have printed bigger on the counters. But even so there is a ton of information on them. Way excellent game.

A huge game with over 1500 counters and map that will dominate an entire room. It takes months to complete a game. Despite its size, a lot of love went into the design of this game. Every effort was made to streamline the mechanics and make the game playable. I’ve been a part of a number of three player campaigns. The experience of playing is remarkably satisfying, much like getting fully immersed in a long running mini-series.

I love the Normandy Campaign, I love monster games, I love the BN level scale, I love the simple but effective supply system and I love the counters.  The map is not as nice as the counters and, the beach landings are a little flawed (if you Allies don't get at least three BHs on Omaha its over) and there are lots of complaints about all the flak units, but somehow the game still plays well. Although I can't say I have ever seen German play win the campaign game, but I have seen one or two hang on through the end of July.  Still, I would play this game anytime.

Finally finished making my own components for the game (including new graphics for the map and counters) and I have started playing the invasion over and over, just to see the game in action. Quite Exciting!!!

The game is quite epic in scope but I can only lay 5 of the 7 new, larger maps on my 4x8' table!

I have wanted to play TLD for years and years, but I have a problem reading the 1/2" counters' formation IDs, as well as the small size of the hexes vs. the number of units. Now I am finally getting to play the game and I am LOVING IT! It is a very fun system and it pulls you along almost effortlessly (other than the rules and the sheer number of counters) from phase to phase and turn to turn.

One thing: I don't quite believe the Allied tactic of blowing 2km holes in the ZOC-less lines with a barrage and motoring on through to attack other units. There are ALWAYS survivors from arty barrages! Also not quite believable is the specific targeting of units during a barrage and that units *retreat* from a barrage rather than hunkering down. Other than that, this is a very enjoyable system.

Too bad Hasbro turned us down on a new edition.... 8^(  I even finished the 3rd edition r/b that now sits unused.....

Played this as a multi player (2 x Allies vs 2 x Germans), a number of times in the mid 90's. Really enjoyed t, worked well multiplayer though it did move rather slowly and being Igo-Ugo there was a lot of sitting around during the opponents movement phase. The mechanics seemed to mesh pretty well. 

Update - This year I had an opportunity to play the Carenten scenario FTF. It was disappointing in terms of balance and enjoyment, but it reminded me how much I enjoyed the system.

I love this game so much I have two copies.  The play sequence, supply system, flexible (but not ridiculous) artillery support, combined arms modifiers and other chrome made it interesting withour weighing it down unnecessarily.  Some didn't like the German style symbology on the counters.  I found that it gave the game a sense of history though.  The drawback was that it was so big that I couldn't find oponents.  I played a couple solo campaign games and a few scenarios (almost 30 years ago) with fairly historical results as I recall.

This is my all time favorite wargame.  Easy rules, but size makes it a bit more difficult.  Full of historical info., even on the counters, this game really makes the compaign come alive.  In addition to other reviews, multiple step turns with mech. movement and  defensive fire allow for breakthroughs, and combined arms provide positive modifiers.  Can't say enough about this game for historical accuracy and rewarding play.  Finding time and space to play can be an issue though.

My most-played monster. The OB has been challenged, and quite rightly, and the map is hideous by today's standards. I'm probably in the minority in actually preferring the game's unit symbols to the standard NATO fare. The system itself was accessible and made this a playable monster, and play it I did, a lot in the 80s and as recently as 2007.

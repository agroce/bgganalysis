Honestly, Arena is little more than a more strategic version of of King of Tokyo. 

The one thing I feel the need to point out about Arena is a central mechanic where the player bids for special abilities at the beginning of the game using health. The game is really meant to be played this way, and tends to run long otherwise. The active issue is that new players have no idea what to bid, having no reasonable way to assign worth to a particular ability.

This game is an arena fighting style game where you are pitted against your fellow warriors in an attempt to be the most healthy when the first player is knocked out. However, you must use your life points to bid on your starting equipment and thus balance between starting healthy and having that weapon you really want.

It's intriguing, but simple and short enough of a dice chucker that it fits squarely in "King of tokyo" land of complexity, though maybe slightly more involved. It is most like "ultimate warriorz", and i like "Arena for the gods" better.

Great game on a gateway-ish level, definitely recommend trying it.

I wanted to like Arena for the Gods as it sounded fun but actually I couldn’t enjoy it half as much as I had expected: unsurprisingly it’s just your average arena with lots of chrome and nothing more, that is, a brawl where everyone is at odds with each other and rolls some dice and then bashes the perceived leader.

It can be fun, sure, but Arena is just the umpteenth iteration of the same concept: not even the starting auction makes it better as getting the «worst» equipment isn’t as bad as it may sound whereas saving a few hit points is way more valuable.

It's an upgrade to King of Tokyo in some ways.  I think the bidding part really works well.  Plenty of choices and with the variable weapons, spells, etc. it's always a different game.

One of my favorite games of all time. Easy to learn for new gamers, but enough strategy for veterans. It's best played as a last man standing game as opposed to playing until one person dies like the rules suggest.

Tried it in an event before its release.
Only one game with 6 players. Was quite interesting and a lot of fun although I'm usually not that much into dices.
Can't wait to try it again!

There was clearly a decent amount of care that went into making all the bits and art for this game. I could see calling it overproduced, but that's probably one of its selling points. I enjoyed it for what it was. But it is not in my dicehouse of style. I wouldn't want to replay it but would if it was the only option people wanted. Just not into the whole combat of the game. The bidding takes a while to get through and really impacts things. I was fortunate to avoid being one of the people pummeled near death. The whole game ending as soon as one person dies really makes a weird dynamic of people trying to just poke around. The person with the most health was too far away to kill the dying ones, and we all wanted to bring her health down. So I just waited until I could end it despite it potentially causing a tie game, which it did.

Cool fun fighting game with some top notch components, as we know from iello. They did it again this year. I think we will spent a lot of time on the iello booth in essen. Mountain of madness, bunny kingdom and this one.

Need to play a few more times (with more than 3p) in order to rate properly.   The artwork and production are amazing, with the clip-on dice exhaustion tokens being perhaps the only negative.   The buff tokens work nicely, however.   

The front-end auction is both the best and worst part of the game, in some ways.   I appreciate this kind of front-end variability and liken it to something like Gauntlet Of Fools in that regard.   After that, the face-punching is maybe not all that interesting.

Will probably end up as a 6 or 7 for me.   I also expect this will be a hard game to get to the table.

This was not as fun as I thought it would be. I've enjoyed King of Tokyo, which is very simple and quick and this has a similar feel to it. I really thought that this would be an upgrade from that, but it just kinda fell flat. 

I'm a fan of the bidding mechanic which makes everything more exciting and personal., but you're just literally walking, pushing, dealing damage over and over again. It's kinda flat for me. I think I really have to be in a silly mood; walking around making noises and making up characteristics for my champion for it to be fun. 

+ Artwork
+ Really cool 3D-effects with the spiky towers that are also well made and easy to put together.

Love the idea of this game; buy power cards with your health, when the first person falls whomever has the most health wins.  Its just a bit too long and too much downtime in-between turns.  Also, bidding zero and taking the last card on each bid gives an astronomical advantage.  There really needs to be a mechanic to force bidding.

Simple, but fun gameplay make for a great ~1hr long game. Ultimately the one thing holding me back from anything higher than 7/10 is lack of variety. There is 4 types of cards with about 12 each set...that's great, but after 5 or so games you'll have seen all the game has to offer. I hope there will be additional content available to purchase.

Amazing game. I was floored by it at PAX Unplugged and everyone in my group ending up leaving with a copy. Character drafting is super easy and incredibly diverse. Combat is super easy to understand. The component quality is phenomenal. I've never seen cardboard standees work this well. Miniatures might be better, but the quality of everything makes is feel unnecessary and it would just inflate the price. The only thing holding it back are some confusions about line of sight and faraway (-1 Star). The only thing that seems to confuse new players is the auction format for getting gear, but luckily they get 4 tries and then they're set.

Very enjoyable game.  The mechanic where you use your health to buy your armor and weapons is interesting since the winner is the player with the most health remaining after the first person is eliminated.  I recommend giving this game a try if you get the chance.

King of Tokyo meets Ultimate Warriorz. An excellent party game. A better filler game than KoT for gamers. Not as good as KoT for a non-gamer type audience, but still very easy to learn.

Like a more complicated King of Tokyo (more rules to learn).  You really don't have much control over your fate, it is pretty random.  My favorite part of the game is drafting the cards, which is a very small part of the game.  You pretty much get to use all your cards each turn, so the winner is basically determined on who gets targeted the least.

Gladiator combat with different arenas, equipment and tactics every game. Interesting bidding phase where you spend your life to get the items you want. 

Played: About 12 times.

Update: Downgraded from 8 to 7.5 after further plays. Still enjoy it but it can got just a bit long.

Fun, Exciting, and Quick.

This will completely overtake Ultimate Warriorz, with the only advantage for that game is it plays up to 8. 

The 4 cards give each player a unique character while still maintaining a very simple rule set. 

This game is the perfect fit for my group as we like confrontational games, but we also like them to be quick and simple.  

If you are a fan of Ultimate Warriorz, KoT, and even Heroscape, this game is likely in your wheelhouse.

Pre-Ordered and Jjst got it in.  Little ones exited to open the box and put together the pieces. Fantastic artwork as usual from Iello. Family loves it.  . 

Easy enough for our kids to understand, and the auction mechanic in the beginning brings a twist to traditional dice rolling battle abilities.  Have Ultimate Warriorz, and enjoyed playing this one a bit more.  Also have Heroscape and MTG: AotP, so love the Arena battles.  This one allows us to enjoy battles with our kids.

Not a bad game, however, the rules can be fiddly at times and the rule book does not always clear things up. Also it is somewhat random who attacks whom. Half of this game is convincing others someone else has more life than you do so they attack that person.

Excellent family beat-down fun.  Go in the arena naked and run around avoiding combat trying to survive or go in armed to the teeth and get the first kill hoping you have the most life points for the win.  There's a bit of push-your-luck element in how you expect to fare vs. how you arm yourself for the match.  Simple dice rolling fun.

We played free-for-all, and afterwards agreed that teams would be more interesting.

May or may not be better than Knizia's [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3242/clash-gladiators]Clash of the Gladiators[/url]. Infinitely better than [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/128671/spartacus-game-blood-treachery]Spartacus[/url], though, which my group loves despite its awfulness.

The combination of "Life points are hidden and used to bid at the start" and "If one guy is killed, the person with the most Life points is the winner" kills the game for me. Not as bad as in Nightfall, but similar.

A neat combat game with some cool combos, a short playtime, solid amount of variability, and yes, a healthy helping of luck. I love the look of the game and how well it plays.

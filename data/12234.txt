It is the best of the OCS games that I have tried but I am starting to think that OCS is better suited for higher counter density.

Edit: After almost half a year into the full campaign I don't think this is as great as they say.

OCS system which in my opinion is brilliant. The other end of the playability spectrum when compared to say SPI's Campaign for North Africa. Has fun optional units like..well...mobile bordello's.Purchased 2004, finally commenced playing June 2008. Completed Operation Brevity scenario as a taster...next up...Crusader!. The extra manoevure options avialable in the desert are enjoyable after fighting in the much denser terrain of Tunisia and Korea.

One of the best operational games for the desert theater in WWII.  Really shows the issues related to supply and maneuver that were so critical to this theater.  OCS is not for the faint of heart, and running an offensive in DAK (as in the desert) is a real challenge.  Crusader and Gazala are outstanding scenarios, and the campaign game is simply awesome.  But beware, it takes a lot of table space - I play it on a ping pong table!

There is a lot to like about the OCS system, but I found Rommel to be overpowered here, which is a similar complaint I have heard of some other OCS titles...the attack needs to be toned down, but hey, that's just me. I question the play testing committed to these monster titles.

RATING: 10
I've rated DAK2 a 10, the rating I give to most of the OCS games because it's such a good game system, but I've been playing it a bit recently and I'm starting to wonder if there is a scale mismatch here. DAK2 has the reputation of being low-density, but this is only compared to the monster East Front games, and maybe not even then. Every division of significance is multi-counter, and the panzer divisions can be represented by up to 10 pieces. But the front is fairly narrow, so you do routinely get massive stacks crashing around and a lot of fiddly counter density; I kinda think Vance Von Borries has made smarter choices about this stuff in EFS and Rommel's War; in a game that's really divisional in scale, DAK2 has plenty of company-sized units, which is absurd. Coming back to this after playing a bunch of the far more manageable Burma, Reluctant Enemies, and Sicily was actually a bit of a bummer.

Another unfortunate thing about DAK2: many of the multitudes of scenarios are terrible. I played 1st Alamein which was, quite honestly, a terrible piece of design work that was a waste of my time and I have a hard time believing anyone ever playtested it.

Anyway, this was all a bit ranty. OCS is still a great game system, and if you stick with the obvious scenarios (Crusader, Gazala) you're probably in good shape. I have enjoyed this game in the past. But after a few somewhat unsatisfying games, I'm thinking it might be trending towards a downrating.

RATING: 8
Big in scale, but low in counter density. If you can fit the maps on your table and have an interest in the war in the desert, this is an absolute must. The OCS focus on supply and unit quality is perfect for what this theatre was all about.

Although the campaign game may still be just too much for most players, this game is rescued for the more casual player by the low unit density (unlike, say, GBII), and by the plethora of scenarios and campaign starts. If you want to start the game at Crusader, you can, and you can compare how you've done by the time of Gazala (for example. The same is true of every major and minor operation that occurred in this campaign, from the Italian invasion of Egypt through to Second Alamein). And it has a brothel unit.

The downsides:
Size and length. The campaign game requires you to find space for four maps, and time for what could possibly be 2 years of fighting.
Complexity. The game layers on oodles of special rules for the theatre to represent the atypical nature of the fighting and the forces present. And that's without the options, of which there are many...

Comments specific to DAK II

Disclaimer - Review based two plays of the Cauldron and one of Gazala scenarios.  I have also played several scenarios from Burma and Tunisia..  

North Africa is the theater where I expected OCS to either shine or fail miserably.  Sadly it has done the latter. Supply was undisputed King here ... but the Queen was maneuver.  We found DAK was the system at its worst.  Turns drag on as you push your supply chits around, and then your opponent's supply chits respond, somewhere in between a few combat units move and one or two battles take place ... often determined by freak surprise die rolls.  It doesn't "feel" like North Africa.  And the tottering piles of units around Tobruk ... ridiculous.  The system's focus on supply detracts from the sweeping maneuver and chaos of Cauldron ... which isn't appreciated.  Sadly, one of my regular opponents was finally and fully turned off by OCS by the Cauldron scenario.  He said doing taxes was less painful, and I *thought* I was letting him play the interesting side.

After giving DAK three tries, I doubt it'll be put on the table again.


Comments on the System

The Operational Combat System takes an interesting view of operational warfare, placing supply considerations in the fore, but the supply system is cumbersome and fraught with logical inconsistencies.  For me at least, OCS' marriage of wargame and pick-up-and-deliver game don't work.  The supply system requires too much session time, and despite occasionally adding an interesting dimension to play, it is not engaging enough to warrant the time it requires.  

I focus on the supply system, because one can't enjoy OCS unless they accept its treatment of supply.  There is much to like in OCS, I love the way it treats artillery bombardments, troop morale, and reserves for example.  I'm less enthusiastic about it's lack of ZOCs, and the power of aerial bombardments, but I am happy to live with them both.

Here are the specific issues I have with the supply system.

Consider that the distance across which a headquarters unit can deliver supply to their subordinate units never changes due to weather.  This is ahistorical in the extreme, particularly in the system's home theater, the East Front of WWII.  The rasputinia comes, the hard freeze, the heavy snows, the subzero temperatures ... nothing impacts the distance at which a headquarters can deliver supply.  Other operational systems handle the impact of weather on supply, and do it with some elegance.  i.e. it can be done and done elegantly.  In my mind, the impact of weather on supply is a necessary part of simulating many theaters.

Consider, supply is moved by trucks and other conveyances.  If you want to unload supply in OCS, you have to pay movement points.  Fair enough, movement points represent time spent idle while supply is unloaded from the transports ... but not always.  OCS has a huge loophole that allows trucks to drive through an area and "throw" supply to units, units which are not in the same hex or even adjacent.  Units which can be several hexes away ... and again regardless of weather.  The trucks continue moving after "throwing" supply in this way, without penalty.  Put another way, trucks that "throw" supply move the exact same amount as empty trucks or trucks that don't unload supply during their move.  Only trucks that explicitly unload supplies in a hex (and it has to be a hex with a unit or a  Port etc!) pay a penalty.  This is a logical disconnect that makes no sense to me.  It favors positioning and game play that again, are ahistorical and counterintuitive.

Consider, motorized units burn supply to move using their inherent transport.  Many can opt to move "on foot" without paying that supply.  They move at a slower rate which is logical.  Now let's say they do this for several turns and move beyond the maximum range of their transport (ie further than their single turn motorized MPs).  The next turn, you choose to supply them with fuel.  They a flipped over, and their trucks, which they left more than a turn's movement away, now magically appear in their hex, at no additional cost, and they can move at their maximum amount.  Again this is a logical disconnect.  Worse, in a system that markets itself as demanding realistic planning, this allows players a freedom that real commanders never enjoy.  

Granted the alternative is practically unplayable, but OCS pushes the treatment of supply to the limits of "playability" anyway.

Finally consider what exactly is supply.  It is ammunition, it is fuel, it is concrete and other fortification construction materials.

Now consider that you move some of this generic supply to a specific area.  In your mind, you are moving construction materials for use in building a fortification next turn.  Now I surprise you by attacking in that area, and you burn the supply as fuel so that your motorized forces can move in response to my attack.  They burn construction materials?!  So you just spent several minutes managing a generic supply system and at the very last second that supply can magically become anything you need it to be.  An ability which again, I imagine real commanders dream of possessing. 

It can be argued that these latter two aspects of the system are necessary abstractions for playability.  Fair enough, but realize that the supply system that they are part of *dominates* this system.  In a typical turn you will spent 30-100% of your time managing supply.  Entire turns will pass where you do nothing *but* move supply.  This makes for a fascinating challenge at times, but in my experience it more commonly results in a grinding monotony.  A monotony that leaves gamers like myself wondering was all this supply overhead worth the time?  Couldn't the same effects have been achieved without the rather crude approach of moving dozens of markers around the map?


Further, the OCS treatment of supply tends to detract from the fog-of-war that wargames hope to achieve.  I can see you moving and amassing supply in an area ... should I expect your offensive efforts to take place soon?  Should I expect them to take place out of range of the dumps you've gathered?  A whole game develops where one tries not to telegraph their intentions.  Whether one likes such games within their wargames is a matter of taste.  Honestly, it rather interesting at times, but too much of a headache at others.

Should I bombard those supply concentrations within range, hoping to disrupt your offensive, or to throw your ability to defend against mine into chaos ... sorry, you can't bombard supply anymore ... it's immune.  I'm interested in seeing how OCS treats the siege of Sevastopol for example, where supply dumps were important targets of initial bombardments.  In fact, bombarding enemy supply concentrations is fundamental to modern attack technique.  Again, OCS has banned it as it was deemed too gamey.

In closing, *all* the wargames I play make abstractions.  I appreciate wargames that take supply into consideration in an elegant way.  Spending a high percentage of my gaming session managing a supply system filled with loopholes, logical inconsistencies, and ahistoric results doesn't hold interest for me.  I gave OCS a second chance (having disliked v1.0).  I can't imagine giving it a third.

Sold all my games in the series.

What a monster. To quote another player, "In a typical turn you will spent 30-100% of your time managing supply."

I don't know about you, but I play wargames for at least some modicum of fun, above and beyond just general interest about the historical situation. Copious supply management sounds like the worst sort of drivel I can think of, and from what I've read it isn't realistic anyway, so what did all that complexity get you in the end? Nothing but tedious gameplay that doesn't add up to squat.

Pass.

The OCS is an innovative system with nice mechanics.  This game's rating suffers primarily due to the unplayable nature of the game due to size and length, as well as an utter lack of victory conditions.  Issues dealing with Tobruk, the early part of the campaign (9/40-3/41), and lack of player incentives to take any offensive action cause my rating for this game to be a bit lower than perhaps the OCS warrants.

Now ive played this game quite alot and I think its one of the best monster game around the market.
Its considered a monster but only for the space it takes up for the campaign game not for the playability.
The game can be palyed by two players easily.
The supply rules of the OCS system are perfect for this theatre of war and the feeling that you have is really what you can imagine was the war in north africa.

Last week end I punched trough the fortified El Alamein line with the germans and it was wonderful, i spent every single token of supply to accomplish that with some units going low on supply.
We immediately remade the setup and started over with the commonwelth player  
asking revenge....it will be mutch  toughter this time. ;-))

the game itself feels like addiction: just one more T just one more T and it'll all work out I'll get across the wadi and flank them and il duce/churchill will love me WHY ARE THE TRUCKS SO SLOW

the most headache inducing OCS experience I've had so far, I ended up abandoning my campaign in Jan '41 upon discovering some mistake (can't even remember, something in the exclusive rules) that let Italians trace further east of Sidi Barrani than they were meant to. 

But it's still on the shelf calling me, my Venus in Khakis. Maybe a shorter scenario, I can control myself...

A labor of love that elegantly captures the ebb and flow of the historical desert campaigns.  Some of the best graphics in OCS, too.  The only real drawbacks are the necessity of hauling supply to the Wire by truck (particularly for the Axis), leading to constant token truck movement drills, and the wealth of special rules to keep track of.  Still one of the best ways to put 9' of table to work.

What is a "monster" wargame?  

For me, this is the answer.  The pinnacle of what a monster wargame should be.  Research, rules, and playability/fun.  This game has it all.  The game is very playable for a 9 foot long 6 map monster.                                                                              The north african theatre is very interesting and OCS handles it perfectly.  The OCS emphasis on supply and weak zones of control accurately reflect reality in the north african front.  The fact that OCS, a game created to handle the eastern front, is able to seamlessly simulate a north african desert with only a couple of tweaks is remarkable.                                                                            Plus, even if you hate wargames, DAK has a mobile bordello unit.  This is historically accurate, and as far as I know is the only place to get a bordello chit.  Who can turn that down?

Update:
Insanely good wargame.  Definitely not for everyone, as length and complexity will only appeal to the hardcore wargamer, but this game is still far more accessible than ASL with more playability and similar amounts of historical accuracy.

Update 2: OCS 4.0 has really sexed this up.  Things are more clear, streamlined, and faster.

OCS is definitely the most interesting of WW2 operational systems I have played, although I'm still waiting to play EFS. It combines fascinating and tense decision making over supply with long term goal oriented think and fog of war. Dak2 specifically combines all the good stuff around OCS and then  provides not only small playable scenarios,  but a great campaign as well, you can bite off as much as you want. While OCS is not the simplest system or the most elegant game (although it isn't bad by wargame standards) it is supremely functional providing you with seeming limitless options and massive depth. I could care less about the simulation aspect although it may do this very well, this is a truly superb game for those with the stomach to engage in a system that requires some investment to play properly. 

DAK2 provides manageable counter density.
This game is amazing, i need some more plays NOW!!! :)

Quite good! The historical feel of this game is probably better than any other Operational-level game that I have played. Watching historical results unfold with this system is impressive. And that from a generic system like OCS. Gets extra points from me for including so many battles in North Africa as short scenarios of 9 turns or less, (Compass, Brevity, Battle Axe, Crusader, Gazala, various El Alamein). Of course, the historicity of the system may preclude some battles as competitive "games", but they are still darned interesting from an historical perspective. Air units are rated individually (fun!) and part of a well integrated air sub-game. Rules are long, but most of the length is to cover every possible situation, (and some would applaud the thoroughness). IMHO, OCS is really a typical wargame with: supply dumps and usage, involved ZOC's, air rules, and unit modes, (mind you, I don't play the campaigns which add rules). Other than that it's pretty standard grognard stuff.

This game is a solid 6 because I will have to be in the mood to play it again.  Another game in which I had high hopes for but fell short.  I like the era and for the most part, the components.  The historical notes are great too.  The main reason I will have to be in the mood to play again is due to the micromanagement feel.  I really feel that its too much.  I like detail in my wargames but I felt like this one was a little too much.  Once again, I see I'm in the minority here but that's ok, this seems to be a constant theme with me and MMP games.....which may be why I don't actually own any.

For another $200, what exactly did this version add that the original did already have in spades?  It still suffers from the same flaw as the original in that two competent opponents who don't feel compelled to follow historical campaign operations and tactics still have a tendency to end in stalemate.  The victory conditions are a total cop out.  Don't bother with any of the campaign games beginning before 1942.

A big and beautiful game. It is rich and dynamic, fast and furious and very historical. Blood sweat and tears have given this game its rightful place at the top of the boardgaming hill.

True masterpiece.

We're gonna need a bigger table!

Probablemente el mas divertido de la serie. La posibilidad de ver el avance de otros frentes (grecia, malta..) ,los eventos aleatorios, el entrenamiento de las tropas, fantástico.

One of these days, I'd like to get a group together and play, in order, DAK (or DAK2), Tunisia and Sicily. The I'd like to move to the Russian Front games and finally (but not least), Burma and Korea). Ahh, ambition.

My prefered OCS one. Desert war with all italian troops (Ariete, Folgore, Bersaglieri). Plenty of space necessary but quite good depiction on the subject.

OCS is the greatest of all WWII operational systems. And DAK2 is the greatest module of OCS.

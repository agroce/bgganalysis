We only play this game with 3, but it really can't be played with three...it's really not fun.  But the kids seem to like it.

It should have had a picture in addition to the word on the card. If so, this would be rated much higher and it would have been much more enjoyable for my younger son.

Good version of the standard (adults) game for children. The hand size is smaller and the last card doesn't count rule is not used and children seem to find it as much fun as the adults do their version. Recommended.

RATING: 7
Great game.  Consistently one I pull out with both friends and family.  The variety of cards and the ability to add your own give you continuous sources of entertainment.  Truly the perfect game, easy to teach, even easier to play.  Never met anyone who didn't like this game.  THE perfect party game... if you don't play it to death.

Great Kids Version of [gameid=74].  The kids version is exactly like regular [gameid=74] except it has easier cards.  The nouns and adjectives are very child specific and themed.

A good "family" version you can play with children.

Donated my copy to a school when my son got older and we could play [gameid=74].

Apples To Apples Junior edition
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Our family of four loves to play this game; the kids started playing when the youngest was 6. We play debate style where players get to promote why their choice is the best: this is a great way to develop debating skills as each person tries to (very creatively in most cases) convince the judge that his/her card is the best match. Sometimes the judge picks the most obvious match and sometimes the most creatively convoluted match (this can be a way of letting each child win at least one round). We just make sure that the more voluble players don't take too much floor time as this can be intimidating for younger or more shy children at first. They may need help getting started on how to defend their point of view; once they get it, though, their ideas really blossom. After this, kids will be ready for The Big Idea.

RATING: 5.623
Apples to Apples for kids with adults - probably more fun that the original Apples to Apples (2/11/10). UPDATE: Probably better than the original Apples to Apples game, as it really is something that should be played with kids and not adults.  It is definitely not a gamers mechanic.  Alas, whilst they were good memories of 8 games, clearly the kids have grown, and its gathering dust.  Donated to work colleague with young kids (Rating: 5.623, Dec 16)

In all honesty the junior version works just as well with adults as kids. It doesn't have the pop culture references of the adult version but still quite fun to play.

This game always starts fun, but within about 5-10 minutes someone gets bored and then just starts picking random cards. Example: Card to match "Historical Figure", cards that come in Abraham Lincoln, Caesar, Hitler and Chocolate. And the bored person will pick Chocolate.

It was not as bad as I was expecting it to be.  It is harder to be funny with these cards, except when you have the noun- mushroom, and the adjective- magical.

I was about to change my rating to 6 to reflect my overall gaming habits but then started thinking 'Aren't all games, and thus their ratings, situationally depenent?'. I decided yes and thus my  rating remains. 

I certainly prefer the junior 9+ edition as it opens the game up for the kids to join in and they really let the game shine. It's a great way to play with kids and adults. 

(We play with the 9+ green box edition)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
They did a great job putting together a set of cards where which card to play is much more direct than in the regular Apples to Apples.  Great to play with early readers, and even pre-readers, where they act as judge.  Some of the cards aren't aging very well, but not many (ex: my kids have no idea who/what "Raggedy Ann" is).

RATING: 5.2
It's fun even though it eventually wears thin.

RATING: 7
The simpler words don't detract from the game play at all.  Some of the cards reference things more relevant to young people ("The First Day of School", "My Grandpa"), but that's not really a big problem.

Great for kids right through primary school. With younger ones, it might be better to have an adult be the "judge".

My 9-year-old asks for this one regularly. He likes being the judge, but he also likes picking goofy answers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A great game concept that works better with kids than with all-adults, and better with more players than fewer. The main drawback is that even the junior game requires good reading and vocabulary skills, making it difficult to include younger children just learning to read. On the other hand, kids love rotating in and out as "the judge" and alternating between serious answers and ridiculous answers, and it's a good game for family and friends to play together. (My one snooty complaint - the game relies heavily on brand-name recognition, such as Disney cartoon characters, which I think could have been eliminated without affecting the game.)

RATING: 5.8
Always spawns lots of laughs with the kids. Simplified word choice doesn't work nearly as well with adults. We've created a pool of kid-friendly words from the base game and use that pool of words when playing with the Kids. It's more enjoyable for everyone than the extremely simplified word choice in this edition.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
As with all party games - so much of the game mood depends on the people involved.  While this game can be an interesting diversion for a large group, the "randomness" of judging means that this is ultimately a game wherein one has very little control.  In other words, its an activity not a game. (Yes, I have a very low opinion of Apples to Apples.)

This junior edition makes it even worse by adding in the random mind of a child and the types of associations they will make.  But I have rated this as a kid's game (so it is actually higher than the base A2A game).  For a light game that can be played with your young kids, this might work, especial in a party or other social setting.

It's like Apples to Apples, but with less interesting cards. I suppose the cards are more kid-friendly, but they're also more mundane and boring.

As its name implies, this is a version of Apples to Apples designed for kids, although the basic game still works well with adults, too. Compared to the original game, this edition features simplified words that even young children can understand and has no "suggestive" words that adults would be uncomfortable explaining to the kids. Out of the Box re-named this editon in 2007 from Apples to Apples Junior! to Apples to Apples Kids, though is a different game from Apples to Apples Junior

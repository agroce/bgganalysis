This game brings emotion like few others do. Shocking big moves, huge swings, nail-biting tension... So much fun.
This was The Game for a good 5 years.

Despite never having watched a single episode of the show, I took to this right away. It's my current "can't wait to play this again" hotness-of-the-moment game.

Update: I have now started watching the show because I enjoyed the game so much. Now I get what all the hype was about :) Still loving the game, too.

RATING: 8
Based on 3 plays.
The rules are pretty hard to get to grips with without someone who knows the game - just so much stuff to grasp.  But after 1 play I think we understand the game.
Worth watching the rules video explanation if you are playing from scratch.

And verdict:  loved it. Can't wait to play again!

After 3 plays still struggling with some of the fiddly bits of the rules.
Starting to think that the game takes too long to play (4 hours last night). Downgraded from 9 to 8.
I find it incredibly tense and traumatic being a human - which is great that a game can generate those feelings....

RATING: 8
The core mechanics are ok, but nothing to write home about (probably worth a 6 out of 10). However, the presence of a Cylon(s) is what really makes this game shine. There is so much mistrust around and the Cylon players can really influence the game in their favour without necessarily revealing themselves. Great table banter although can be a little long

A great game. Can get a little bit "same-y" after a while. The amount of fun you have will depend entirely on who you are playing with. Most people I know never want to play this game. Make sure your friends will play it with you before purchasing. :)

BSG is at the upper limit of my personal tolerance for a game-in-which-you-lie-to-people, so I have to be in a particular mood to play.  But I enjoy it when I do.  Except for the last hour.

Just bought this game.  Only played once and didn't finish as ran out of time, but cannot wait to play again.  Huge fan of the TV series and always concerned that tie-ins (video or board game) are typically a massive disappointment.  However, this was an amazing surprise!

"Going through the motions: the Game"
Everyone says you don't have to know the series to enjoy Galactica. You kinda do.
Otherwise there is neither intuition nor logic behind what happens. 
It drags on forever.

I love deduction, bluffing, negotiation, co-operation in games. Here they do nothing for me. Feels forced, artificial, clunky.

Like an elaborate, too ambitious version of Avalon. Yeah i said it. Suck it.

RATING: 7
Played this for the first time. It took a while for us to get into a rhythm, rather than referring to the rule book every few minutes (not unexpected). We had quite a bit of fun, although the frequency of the crisis cards led to a depletion of action cards and made it easier for the Cylon player (me) to cause damage. All in all, we had fun and would play this again, but not on a frequent basis --- we felt a need to recover!

RATING: 10
An excellent semi-cooperative, oozing with theme, and full of delicious betrayal & deceit. My one complaint is that the game depends too much on the Crisis deck from my liking - constantly drawing Cylon attacks/no jump cards massively disadvantages the humans, while never drawing a Cylon attack card hurts the Cylon very hard.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I was exceedingly underwhelmed by this one.  It lasts over 3 hours, and I felt like nothing I did really mattered, the game's pace was ultimately decided by the fate card drawn each turn.  You could easily just turn over the top 10-20 fate cards and figure out if you won or not. There is a lot of theme crammed into it, and a lot of player interaction, but no strategy whatsoever.  It is more like a weak role-playing game than anything.

I didn't know the rules and I've never seen the TV show, yet I had a blast. The game went down to the bitter end and when the bad guys just about won, we humans flew away to victory. Plus I got to push a traitor out of the airlock and into space.

Definitely like to play again.

Best with 5 players (6, 4 ok, can learn with 3).
Has immense replay value especially with the expansions (you can add just the modules you like). With the expansion you can adjust the game according to the evolution of your group's game play skills.

Get Daybreak for 4-player games, the Cylon Leader Motives really make very interesting games.

RATING: 7.9
First off, BIG fan of the show. I was really looking forward to playing this game after a friend bought it. So we've played 2 games of it and though I do enjoy it, there are problems. First problem is with the pilot characters. Once you play a pilot (even a hottie like Boomer), you probably won't want to play that role again. There can be long periods of boredom playing that role and that's not fun gaming. The other problem is play time. This puppy is a long one and I mean 4-6 hours long. Okay, I'm a bit A.D.D. but this game will try anyone's attention span. Now beyond those two issues, there's lots of fun to be had. Trying to ferret out the Cylon player is good detective fun. If you're the Cylon, you get to brush up on your acting skills. As many players have commented, there's plenty of paranoia starting about mid-game. It's juicy fun not knowing what the next crisis might be or if the President is a toaster or not when ugly crisis come back to back. This is the kind of game that can really be enjoyed by the right group (at least 4 players). 

**Update**
Too long. Plenty of thematic play but it just takes forever. I could have easily played 2 other games (to completion) by the time this was over.

I really enjoyed this game. 
I was Gaius Baltar, the President, and the Cylon. 
I am not sure it would be as much fun if I wasn't the Cylon, let alone President Gaius Baltar the Cylon President. I sure did have a blast deceiving and destroying the pathetic humans though.

RATING: 8.5
Only on one occasion did I think this game dragged on too long. Hours melt away as threat after threat is addressed. The headgame element is, as always, intense... why did they do THIS instead of THAT? Are they really trying to help or drag their feet? WHO just killed the skill check, and is it now obvious who they are at this point?

Fun abounds.

RATING: 6
Good tense co-op game, but too long for its weight, almost feels like doing the same turn iteration over too many turns. I feel it is too long for its depth (at ~5 hours almost the same as Arkham Horror). Rating will increase if smoother with more plays, and I would say game is an 8 if you are a fan of the series as it matches its theme quite well.

Another favourite game of mine, where the players slip into the personas of Adama, Starbuck, Apollo and many more. Loyalty cards define if you are a hidden agent of the cylons as there are models now thast look completely human.

The human struggle against crisis hammering on the fleet and dwindling resources require a lot of communication and strategy to be able to overcome the obstacles that are being given each turn.

RATING: 6
An interesting co-op experience with many similarities to Shadows Over Camelot. I very much prefer this to that title. The game really evokes the feeling of the show, and the hidden Cylon/sleeper Cylon stuff is brilliant. I think this game would really shine with repeated plays, but I probably will never get to that point.

This is a provisional rating, since I only played once. I didn't enjoy, but it may also have been an unfortunate playthrough. There is a whole lot to this game and even after a full game, I didn't really feel I understood it. It feels very long and I don't quite understand what if offers compared to similar shorter games, but I love the show and I didn't dislike the game (just didn't like it), so 6.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game can be incredibly punishing at times, but never loses its thematic feel. This should be the golden standard for licensed games, as you really feel, through the character powers/skill checks/locations/crisis cards, like you are on the Battlestar Galactica itself. From behind a facade of tactical combat, this game shows its true self: a bluffing/manipulation exercise. The real difficulty/beauty of this game isn't in blasting the most Cylons, but in deceiving the most players and hiding your true motives. That being said, the game suffers at 4 and, to a lesser degree, 6 players because of lack of balance for the Cylon players, but this is my go-to 5-player game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
It does okay at capturing the feel of the early re-imagined series, but game play is dreadful. Too much time between turns, too many random elements that can leave a player with nothing meaningful to do. The admiral gets to make far too many decisions and the other players are bored to tears.

This is the only game I have played that if it were to hit the table again I would leave; just thinking about it elicits such incredible revulsion.

2 games, played with 5/6 players.
LIKE: Thematic. fighting the ships is fun. Liked the accusation and mystery Cylons.
DISLIKE: Too long, too brutal. I found the "challenge cards" too long to resolve and the consequences too harsh. sometimes you'd even take a penalty if you pass, which I did not like.
OVERALL: pass. it's more fun to be the Cylons.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The three-pronged approach for determining the Cylon is amazing:
1) The handful of cards and abilities that let you look at someone's loyalty card (Hard, Rare Knowledge)
2) The statistical games you can play with who contributed or didn't contribute various cards to Crises (Less Hard, Frequent Knowledge)
3) Reading people, probing them with questions, and interpreting their reactions (Soft, Constant Knowledge)

There's so much interplay with those three strategies, and they brilliantly culminate in a 15 minute shouting fest about whether or not Uncle Dan is a frakking cylon (spoiler: he is!).

I'm not aware of a better hidden-traitor game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
With one play under my belt, I'm not terribly willing to play again. I wasn't overly impressed with it, but enjoyed it due to the folks I played with (who love BSG). In our game, we had 3 cylons to deal with at the end, so the humans were just begging for a mercy killing. The game ran long - about 4 hours. Love the theme and the mechanics are surprisingly smart albeit very repetitive. Has nice ebb and flow with cyclons appearing en masse followed by momentary calm after a jump.

All in all, this game is being carried by its theme, the simple fact there are opportunities to be crafty as cylons and obviously fans of the show (or fanboys of FFG) who will crave to play it like a watered down RPG. Others will likely find it only so-so because as a *game* it only serves to carry the accusations of "you're a toaster!".

RATING: 9
Muy buen juego bien ambientado en la serie, sensaciones auténticamente temáticas, como muy pocos juegos consiguen, a mi parecer. Un semi-cooperativo que me ha gustado (porque no es cooperativo puro, al haber cylons ocultos...), y de ocultación de rol inicial. Mucho azar pero también mucha emoción. Las expansiones aportan detalles a tener en cuenta, aunque el juego es ya muy largo de por sí (4h o más), es su mayor "defecto". A 5 jugadores va de maravilla y a 6 yo creo que incluso mejor (3 humanos y 2 cylons + Simpatizante que puede ser de un bando u otro), a otros no lo he probado.
Le veo como punto flaco también, que no está nada compensando, le faltan algunos detallitos para ayudar un pelín más a los humanos ya que el 80% de partidas ganan los Cylon... por ello yo recomendaría jugar sobretodo al principio, con las reglas opcionales (y oficiales del manual) de setup con +2 recursos de cada uno de los 4 a favor de los humanos.

(B&L Own) Fun hidden traitor game, with a theme that exceptionaly well tied into the series. Heavily weighted against the humans.

I really think the theme shines brightly with this one. They did an exceptional job tying it together with the mechanics. I think the game plays best before the cylon is outed. After that it just devolves into the cylons beating the crap out of the humans until they crumble. Our games have been very heavily weighted towards cylon victories.

The fun in this game is very dependent on the group.  If you have a boring group that will not throw our "You must be a frakking toaster" every so often, it will not be a fun game.  The fun is the meta game.

On of the few games where someone has called another person in our group an 'idiot'.

Wonderful hidden traitor / Asymmetrical Co-Op game. Very easy for beginners to get into and does not feel like it takes three hours to play although most of the time it does. 

My least favorite part of the game however is the nomenclature of the plastic pieces and the combat tables. As someone who has seen the show I know what a Viper is but the rule book is not so forgiving to players who may like this style game but have not indulged in 4 seasons of the show.

Is this the best political game of all? Its hard to tell in really heavy combat, but I'd back it against Rep of Rome. Easily FFG's best in-house design and very nearly their best product ever. Top-quality design. A very fine TV-series-to-boardgame conversion that invites a long hard look at the revered but aged Dune. A genuine co-op game for the co-operators, given that a large proportion of the players ally with the game to beat them. It begins to capture the underlying subtly and sophistication of the power-politics situation as portrayed on TV...as well as everything else, which is remarkable in a game as simple as this. "Whats not to like" is a good question. Cylon rules are questionable. Requires decent gamers [and its interesting how many commentators mention this]. And no Tricia Helfer, not even in delusional form for a cylonic Baltar. Unfair to compare to Shadows as its far too good for that.

Draw some coloured cards, play some coloured cards, repeat for 2 - 4 hours. Someone will be a cylon , everyone will be accused of being a cylon, it will be funny for the first 30 minutes (you can also have this same enjoyment by calling out to players in the game from another table that they are a cylon - no need to even play it)

I prefer The Resistance instead, 20-30 minutes of pure treachery and then the game is over and you can enjoy another round or another game without having to sit through another 2 hours of BSG.

Finally played this - at BGG.Con! Had a blast, even tho I was outed as a Cylon by an unlucky "look at someone's card for free" card played on the first turn! Humans won, but it was fun, the player who outed me early actually was revealed to be a fellow Cylon during the sleeper phase. Definitely interested in playing again.

Only reason I don't rate higher is I've only played once, and mostly because of game length.

Most games based on TV shows suck, but this one really captures the spirit of the first 3 seasons of BSG.  Lots of cooperation is required to survive while some players are trying to undermine you.  This is one of the most interactive games out there.  And even better, nearly every move and decision has a built in fog of war that creates tension and distrust.  You spend a lot of time trying to explain why you are not a Cylon and rationalize your actions -- which is even more fun when you ARE the Cylon.
The downside is that it takes a big group (5-6) to really make it shine, the game can seem quite repetitive, and it usually goes about 1 hour too long.  I've played both Colonial and Cylon and either side is fun, but it's a lot more fun to be the Cylon.  

I traded my copy because I never got to play it, and when I did, I joined a group at a guy's house and he would set up his copy in advance.

[b]Update:[/b] I decided that this is an awesome game the first couple of times that you play it, but over time, it loses some of its luster because it takes a long time and doesn't have a lot of variety in the cards.  You could buy the expansions, but they cost a lot and the game still takes a long and requires a lot of players, so I choose not to go that route.  For me, it's a "once a year" game: very good, but not great.

[b]Update II:[/b] This one is falling fast.  The mechanics are nothing special and become quite tedious.  The thrill is in the psychological game and the interaction.  Now, too many players have figured out that if you are not the admiral or the president, that you should reveal early.  When that is the case, it becomes a bit dull.  The thrill is gone.

This game is brilliant, like the Resistance but longer and with more political manoeuvring as well. Fairly long, and hard on the humans, but very satisfying. It is not improved on with the expansions. I'd suggest keeping it clean as expansions add stuff but not depth.

RATING: N/A
Due to luck of the draw and the destiny deck, the cylons had zero chance to win when I played, and it was extremely underwhelming.  None of the choices really felt tense or meaningful, and when I got a "You are a cylon!" card at the halfway point, I just shrugged.

I hear many stories that this is not a normal situation, but I'm not really excited about investing time into learning a game that is as swingy as this.  I already know how to play Dead of Winter (aka I've done the investment) so I'd rather play that.  This game felt like much ado about nothing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's reputation is well deserved. It is a game of intrigue that makes it so much more than just a more 'complicated resistance(Another lighter boardgame)'. This is done with the actions and cards one plays and the events that results in many layers of deceit and paranoia. All this also culminates in the theme coming out so much better than resistance. Another plus is the game can work with more passive players as you can passively help or not help with a situation and since most of the time, it is hard to just flat out be sure someone is a Cylon, the passive players can play without too much worry of too much 'attention', unlike Game of Thrones where all eyes are on you the minute you break a promise. 

Downside, it is heavily dependent on the players, as one horror story I heard that someone revealed she is a Cylon on the first turn and ruined the game. Also, the game seems to work best at 5 to 6 players and takes a while to play.

Overall, a fine game I enjoy and even though I love Game of Thrones the boardgame too. I will find this game easier to table as it fits a wider crowd than Game of Thrones for example.

La ambientación del juego es muy buena y fiel a la serie original, pero el desarrollo del juego es un poco lento, repetitivo, y en ocasiones un poco "on rails".

A good semi-coop game.  The Cylon aspect creates an excellent feeling of tension and distrust.  Gameplay can feel uninspired at times - plodding, repetitive.  After all, the end goal for the humans essentially is to survive long enough.  Playing as a revealed Cylon is pretty boring.

Would like more plays before commenting in more depth/at greater length.

This is a fun social experience, and an ok game on the side. For players not enjoying the social aspects, this is probably not so good.

My initial play of this was with 6, with both expansions, having never seen the show before and 3 cylons. It was a crazy mess of stuff and I'm still not sure what was going on at certain times.

I HIGHLY recommend the variants/expansion listed here:
http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/399183/

My rating is a 9 with this, lower playing the rules as written.

The variant lowers game length a bit, and greatly improves balance in a number of ways:
Balances human vs cylon win% some.
Balances different #s of players to have closer Cylon win% as each other.
Balances initial cylons vs those who receive the Cylon card in sleeper agents.
Balances the character cards greatly, makes some of them much more interesitng, and adds new and interesting characters as well.
Balances the skill cards some, reducing the importance of this (broken?) Investigative Committee, and making/making the Press Room less of a dominant strategy, and making Engineering cards worthwhile, strengthening blue characters to a reasonable level.

And more...

RATING: 6
My first game was perhaps not the fairest test - 6 players, 4 new, the official no sympathiser variant, and no cylons in the first half of the game.

Whilst the game was clever and thematic, and the accusations did start flying, the game was too long for the amount of decisions and I felt I spent too much time waiting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Thematic game indeed. Mechanics work well with this storyline that is card driven and provides players with choices. 

The pros, includes event cards that provides options to players but most of them are detrimental towards ending the game.

The multiple character powers are also flavorful. The components are top notch.

The cons.......

The actions are somewhat limited by what the crisis cards does to the game. The whole game is played in accordance to what crisis we passed and which crisis we failed and thus have to react to it. Repairs, shoot down raiders, etc. 

Not a bad thing, but makes you feel that the game is playing you, and you have to stop a time-bomb from happening, which you do not exactly have the option over it. The more players there are just drives the game to such ending that much faster.

The cyclon players just helps the system move a bit faster to the ultimate end. Good, skilled cyclon players just bring the inevitable a turn or two faster to its end.

A good human player, may not necessary be that good but the luck of the crisis cards and the jump cards are just favourable for the game session.

Play the game, guess how many jump cards it takes to end the game, and we are almost there.

Interesting game, up a notch for theme. Arkham horror might be a better bet.

Players are divided into 2 groups, humans and cylons.  The identities of the players (humans or cylons) are kept secret unless they are accused by fellow players.

The objectives of the humans are simple.  They need to jump enough distance to reach kobol.  How about the cylons?  They will win by making the humans lose through various ways.  The first way is by attacking Galactica which if Galactica suffers 6 damages at 1 time.  Another way to destroy the humans is by depleting the resources of the humans or let the centurion infiltrate into Galactica successful.

There are 3 kinds of crisis in the game which the humans must handle.  They are cylon attack crises, skill check crises and event crises.

Good points:
Another semi-cooperative game similar to Shadows over Camelot.  I feel that it is more thrilling to be a traitor in Shadows but in Battlestar, it is more fun to be a human than a cylon.  Human players require more thinking to spot the cylons and even if the cylons reveal themselves, they must counter those challenges the cylons provides them with.  It is essential to have cylon players to be in the game to provide the additional challenges.

Bad points:
Cylon players are a little too powerful but a tad too little actions to play with in the game.  If cylon players are stuck in the brig, then they have basically nothing much to play in the game.

The Zen Paradox: Why is it that if there is nothing wrong with this game, what is wrong with it is so very wrong?

I had fun playing the game, but the design is inelegant. That die steals so much from it that I want to cry. Whether it was interference from the SciFi Network, a looming deadline, laziness, or ignorance, that single eight-sided die takes what could have been a game like no other and turns it into a completely average thing.

Brutally tough semi co-op game in the manner of Shadows Over Camelot.

Fits the classic template of emergent crises overcome with cards with one extra wrinkle:

A second set of loyalty cards are dealt at the halfway stage to players, so some previously loyal member of your crew can suddenylt turn evil.

Nasty, fun and captures the feel and tension of the show wonderfully.

I think this is an excellently themed game.  This game is to werewolf as Fury of Dracula is to Scottland Yard.  It is much more fun with BSG fans who get into the theme.

Recreates the tension from the series quite well, not to complicated as long as at least one person is familiar with the rules.

Can tend to drag a bit too long for what it is, but as long as everybody contributes to the tension and paranoia the game need for its length, it works great.

House rule: Everybody need to read (or stare at) their role card for at least a minute, so that players not familiar with the cylon special text get a chance to memorize it.

RATING: 9
One of the most enjoyable games.  Needs at least 4 players fun with 6, but 5 is the sweet spot since you don't use a Sympathizer.  Like Shadows over Camelot on steroids.  Easy to get others into play with about 10 to 15min of instructions, as long as one person really knows the rules.

Also own the Pegasus, Exodus and Daybreak expansions. Haven't used expansions yet.  This game creates great memories. 

Playtime 3 hours.

A game that is faithful to the show.  It's tough to be a human.  Also, your allegiance can change halfway through the game to become a Cylon.  Great strategy game where the turn of just one card can make the difference in your destiny.  I have only played the basic game so far.

RATING: 8
This game is probably the biggest surprise of the year for me. I picked it up through Borders because I had a gift card for the holidays. I rarely shop there and remembered that this game was getting great reviews on BGG. I was skeptical because I had never seen the show and because it seemed like the game would be hinging on the player having done so.

I couldn't have been more wrong. The paranoia and politics of this game are incredible. The traitor (cylon) mechanic is well thought out and made for great gaming experiences. The one piece of advice I have about this game is not to over play when you first get it. You'll want to, but you'll find that it loses some of it's luster through multiple subsequent plays. This could be because of the length and because of it's semi-cooperative nature.

Either way, this is a great game and one that my gaming group has had a lot of fun with.

I have never seen the show and I am not a fan of science fiction. I suspect that if I were (on either or both accounts) my rating would be MUCH higher! As it is, Mr. Konieczka has done such an excellent job at making sure that every possible aspect of the TV show is in this game that it results in a somewhat unwieldy game that could benefit from being simplified just a tad....and maybe with a few less die roll dependent events! Mind you, if it was themed differently (and I hope this happens!) then I would probably be ranting and raving about how glorious it is! The one thing that I have a definite dislike for, though, is the photo art from the TV series pasted all over the place: it just irritates me for some reason, possibly because it reminds me of those dreadful Star Wars boardgames from the late '70's. And the action cards used for skill checks are just way too small for quick ease of reading.
Having said all that, it is a very, very good game if you are fond of (as I am) bluffing in games, and are a good actor. Give it a different theme and larger cards, Mr. Konieczka, and I might have given it a 9....at least!

Paranoia in space. One of the best games I´ve ever played. Got it years before I registered on Boardgame Geek, which explains the lack of registered plays. We played it every sunday for almost an year and never got tired of it. 

Perfect balanced game where it almost every time the winner is declared in the last round. Good idea and well executed in the game where the discussions makes the game into something extra. It helps with the expansions, but throw away the New Caprica board! And of course, it´s always fun to throw your friends in the brig or out of the air lock.

Make a decision with an obvious answer, wait 30 minutes to make another one. IMO, it practically plays itself. There are a few meaningful decisions that a minority of players actually get to make.

Pros
- The theme fits great with BSG and works. The mechanics make sense with the theme.
- Different characters and Cylons add variability
- Cool Viper ships
- Brings out accusations

Cons
- It can get long and a little straight up whenever the Cylons are known
- Plays best with 5 or 6 (without sympathizer), and doesn't work with the rest
- Longer game to teach
- Most people will not be into it as much if they haven't seen the show
- Revealed cylons don't have much to do in the base game once revealed
- Going through the motions whenever every player is revealed

Sold/Traded because:
- Too long for my group
- Not enough of my friends have seen the show
- Needs 5 or 6 people to play 
- The Resistance does it better, is more accessible, shorter, and scales better.

Possibly a good game, but I find it to be *too* thematic. Maybe it's the fault of having seen the show, but if you're playing as Kara and the person sitting next to you is Leoben - the robot who chained her into a room and forced her to act as his wife for a year - that's just, bleh. GET AWAY FROM ME!

It's an interesting world to watch (for a season). It's not one that I want to be a part of though.

That's no fault of the game. But I do not want to play it.

RATING: 4
Meh. 

I love the show and like the basic structure of this game, but the core game-play is just a hastily cobbled together structure upon which the "traitor" mechanic sits. 

This wouldn't be a bad thing, in and of itself, but the game lasts FAR too long for what little enjoyment comes from the psychological metagame (i.e. the fun part). 

A lot rides on the cylon players - if they reveal too soon then the game feels boring. If they play it right then it can be fun for a bit longer, but ultimately only 1 or 2 players gets the "real" fun and the rest are just trying to sniff the baddie out. The Cylon, on the other hand, misses out on the detective game and only gets to mitigate boredom through deception (fun for some, not all). 

Meh.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Way too long, becomes absolutely interminable. Mean spirited in ways that other hidden traitor games just don't seem to be. Might play it again on a good day but probably not.

Played this again, still feel the same. Many players spend multiple turns just giving their turns to other people via executive order. Tension is either very high or non existent. It's just WAY too long for what it offers, other games have improved upon it to a ridiculous degree. Not playing this one again, ever.

Fan-fucking-tastic gem of a game. So much theme. Plays amazingly well. The 2+ hours go by in a breeze if you're immersed in the game.

BSG's definitely vaulted to the top my favorites list, and rightly so. It's an amazing implementation of a paranoia and treachery filled setting, and executes it seamlessly.

RATING: 7.5
Excellent game, though does need specific player counts and the tiny cards can be a bit annoying.  Good table talk, and generally plays in a reasonable (if long-ish) amount of time.

We prefer the official no-sympathizer variant.

I vastly prefer this Co-op with traitor to Shadows over camelot. Although that has roots in how I could relate to and make sense of the theme of the game. That said I played the game first, then watched the series, and after watching the series played again and the thematic match is so very impressive. This game benefits from the context instead of being hindered by it.

RATING: 6
3-6(5)

It's long, sometimes drags (depending on Cylon attack distributions), and loses some theme in that it's just a bunch of skill checks. Still, the meat of it (managing resources and a long con of being a Cylon) are tense and intriguing. I've played the Resistance, and liked it a lot for distilling the traitor mechanic into a quick game, while supporting many people, but sometimes the Resistance turns into a "he said, she said" crap shoot, whereas BSG offers more opportunities to actually think out who the traitor is. Still, it's long and feels even longer if there aren't any Cylons on the board (so you're just collecting cards, or something).

It feels like I'd really need to play this with five to completely balance the experience. You don't have a Cylon struggling to sabotage (nor wonky sympathizer balancing), and it sort of justifies the length.

RATING: 7.5
When I saw this in stores, I always ignored it, assuming that a game based on a TV show was designed primarily to be fun for fans of the show (which I am not), at the expense of being fun for anyone else (which I am).

I have been pleasantly surprised.

I've only played a few games, but this game's loyalty system blows those in Shadows Over Camelot or Bang! out of the water.  Additionally, there is an interesting mix of character abilities, and the core skill check mechanic is fairly solid.

My complaints are simple and few: there is a disappointing lack of different strategy cards, and there is a significant range of power in the Crisis deck, making the luck-to-strategy ratio a bit high for my taste.

(Update) Unfortunately, going to downgrade this one from an 8 to a 7, as either we're hopelessly terrible at this game (but only some of us, sometimes) or this game is hopelessly imbalanced.  The part of me that likes to win is starting to get excited every time I see a "You are a Cylon" card, since I've basically been assured an easy victory.  However, the part of me that actually likes competitive games is starting to get a bit tired of this game.

(Update Update) We've been playing this with the recommended variant of "Start the humans with 2 more of everything", and it seems to do the trick (Maybe a little too much; we should try "Start the humans with 1 more of everything"). If your group finds that the Cylons win too often for your collective taste, try this.

The obvious comparison, because of the traitor/cylon mechanism and cooperative play, is with Shadows Over Camelot.  In terms of thematic gameplay and the range of options open to the players, Galactica is a clear advance on Shadows.  

My opinion of Galactica really has yo-yo'ed.  First game, three player, humans quickly lost but it was exciting, immersive and tense.  Second game, six players, similarly engaging, but we abandoned after three hours, only half way to Earth.  Third game, different group of six players, same result and the game play felt a bit flat and samey.  Fourth game, another different group of five players, much paranoia, a knife-edge finish and the most fun I've had with a boardgame in ages.

What do I make of this?  I think that, much like a role playing game, your experience with Galactica will depend a great deal on the other players.  Add to this a rather variable game length; sometimes it will outstay its welcome and/or the time you have available.

Artwork and production quality are up to the usual FFG standards.

Played 4p and 6p (a bit slow). Would like to try the 5p sweet spot.

I like this though wouldn't want to play it all the time. The fun comes in the suspicion and the paranoia and the role-playing-- the mechanics are fine but nothing special. A thematic experience-- probably better if you've seen the show.

This game would have been fine if it wasn't for the insane hype. Come on people! This isn't that much of a challenge or a game. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed playing it, it was quite alright. But it's mostly a "your mom's a cylon" shoutfest that goes on forever and ever and ever. And if you're not completely socially inept it's not that hard to figure your opponents out.

Great game, best example of a TV series being successfully turned into a board game that I know about. It's highly thematic and the anonymous voting mechanic is wonderful in a cooperative game. Battlestar Galactica certainly makes for some standout signature moments. A particular downside is that a vocal person is bound to dominate the discussion and order people around. Also, at some point the game might turn into a puzzle which removes meaningful choice and experimentation.

OOOOKAY. I really like this game's theme. It perfectly captures the feel of the show for the non-traitors and is full of nostalgic moments, plus playing as the characters from the show with their own special powers is appealing. I also think the game is pretty well balanced. However, the good theme doesn't necessarily make the game fun to play. 

I've played this game in two different groups, both with bad results. One group just dislikes cooperative games in general and didn't have a good time. The other group didn't appreciate the game's length - the game can stretch on for hours. I also feel the rules as written don't adequately explain the mechanic of the cylon reveal which led to some exasperated cylons who didn't understand how to activate.

I'm slightly tempted to consult the community and fill in the gaps, but honestly, I'm not sure I want to bother. I've had a near-universally bad time playing this game and I don't really want to throw good game time after bad.

For me it had a terrible time:fun ratio. Three hours where it seemed not much happened. From the outside, the mechanics and idea behind the game seem cool/fun, but that didn't translate in my gameplay experience. It may be better in future plays, but I'm hesitant to try this game again.

For this type of game I much prefer Resistance, where a similar amount of fun occurs in a much shorter amount of time.

I enjoy BSG once it goes above 3 players.  Generally though, I find it has some issues (primarily in how the cards come out and can make the game very lop-sided for some particular roles, which is very sour if that winds up being your cylon), but I'm hoping they are addressed in the expansions.  I just have not had the time to delve deeply into the game yet.

[Updated March 2012]
After having played more of BSG, I think my feelings are largely solidified.  It's not a bad game, and I will play it, and have some fun with it, but there will always be parts of the design that nag me.  On top of this, although I haven't played either expansion, I know what both do, and I feel their systems only serve to irk me more.

The skill check mechanism creates an interesting game, especially when combined with the traitor mechanics.  This also gives players something to do on the turns of other players.  Needs players who are willing to politick a little.

It took a lot to get me watch the remake TV series this game is based on. When I finally got over my prejudice, I couldn't believe what an amazing show it actually was. A few years later I discover there is this board game based on the show. As a gamer, I'm immediately put off because games based TV shows/movies are pretty much always awful. I should have learned my lesson about judging a book by it's cover. When I finally played the game I was amazed at not just how well it captured the feel of the show, but how innovative and compelling the game was in it's own right. It plays best with 5+ players, and avoids feeling bogged down with so many players by being extremely social. It's one of my favorite games of all time.

Captures the theme of the TV series perfectly. My first game of this was just pure pleasure from start to finish.
Tons of paranoia and accusations. A good addition for any co-op fan.

Playing as a Cylon and watching the humans unravel whilst trying to sow seeds of discontent is just too much fun to have in one game.

I absolutely love this game even though I have not seen all of the TV series. It makes me very keen to see more. 
If you are a fan of the show, stop reading go and play it!

DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME if you are not comfortable with the entire result resting on a single die roll! 
This has happened to me in a couple of games and it is very very annoying but oh so fantastically tense and exciting. This game holds ever so true to it's theme. It IS Battlestar Galactica no questions asked.

Finally watched the end of the TV series:thumbsdown: it has tarnished the game a little for me however if I forget about season 4 then the game is still good as it is season one/two to a T

A fun game though during first play through a few details I didn't quite pick up.  Would like to play a few more times.  I liked the cooperative aspect, but since you knew there were traitors in the mix you still maintained control of you.

Went down from 6 to 4.

+ Thematic adaptation from the (lousy) tv-show.
- It's mostly an experience, barely a game. I couldn't care less about the experience it provides ("let's pretend we know who the Cylon is and send him to the brig, ahahah") and so I try to care about the game. And the game's so poor... The decisions are automatic or irrelevant since its outcome usually comes out of a random draw of a card or a random die roll. On a 3 hours game these characteristics become flaws, big ones.

RATING: 7
This is an interesting game with quite a hefty theme.  Being a fan of the series, I can definitely get into the spirit of the game.  The mechanics seem overly complex, and it seems really difficult for the humans to even have a chance, especially if there is a Cylon from the start.

Full disclosure: I never watched the show associated with this game and I like cooperative games and secret traitor element.

In games of a traitorous element, there's some observable information. While it is the same with this game, the mechanics are slightly more convoluted. No single element to this game is difficult to grasp. It is simply that they are so disparate, it makes it hard to enjoy the game at all. This game is way too long for what it does and  how simplistically it plays.

For fans of the series, there is much that is appealing about the game.  The theme is tightly tied to the storyline.  The characters are meaningful personalities.  If you've never seen the TV show, the game's theme will fall a bit short.  While that may happen, don't confuse the game's theme appeal with the game play.  Theme aside, the game play is quite good.  There's not a lot that's really new (co-op with traitors), but the delayed reveal of the traitor is actually very cool.  The game helps the traitor(s) play convincingly if only because they don't yet know they are the 'baddies'.  The implementation is well done and the components typical of FFG's high standards.

[-]I am not a fan of the story for some odd reason so I think that hurts my interest to an extent[/-]. I am watching the series now with my wife and we are totally hooked. I suspect that my desire to play this game will increase with more context from the series. This is a nice evolution on the traitor mechanic, especially that players can both move and take an action on their turn as compared to the constrained options of Shadows Over Camelot.

What can I say, this game is fantastic.
Obviously playtested to death to get the balance just right. The games I played so far had a very close neck-to-neck finale that was both breathtaking and incredibly involving. Mechanicaly this is a very simple straithforward design with my slight worry that the limited variety in the cards (undoubtly fixed by the expansions) might render the game samey in the long run, but so far almost no game comes close of generating such an intensity and interaction bar possibly TI3.
For me my second favorite FFG release and a great
return to form after the weak Tannhauser and Dust.

This is a game that is really dependent on player with the right crowd.  If you don't, it can feel that there's too much downtime.  It can install a healthy dose of paranoia.  The more you play this the more subtle you learn to be as a Cylon.  I think that this falls in the category of games that you play more for the experience than to win.  That opinion might change with more plays.

I've decided that I really prefer to play this with 5 or 6 players, I don't like how the sympathizer card works with 4 players, and think that it is too weak.  Best with 5.

This game would probably get a 10 from me, but it requires 5 players to really be in it's sweet spot.  As long as there are exactly 5 players though, this is the game I always want to play with a group of that size!  The level of intrigue in this game is amazing and it is always a blast to play!  The game can be a bit long, but if you have players willing to dedicate an evening, it definitely won't disappoint!

Game can be taught within a few minutes.

You don't have to have seen the show to enjoy the game.  I learned the game and was loving it before I had seen it.  However, now that I have seen the show, I do love the references and how the mechanics relate to the characters in the show.

I always have fun with this game!

Great semi-cooperative thematic game.

Has clever ways of simulating the tension of the show between the humans, the humans that hold powerful offices and are suspected of being cylons and the cylons who are trying to sabotage the human efforts to make the journey to Kobol.

Having said that, the experience of play can vary wildly. I've played some games that ranked among the best gaming experiences I've ever had while others were dull exercises in futility.

RATING: 6
We had quite fun with this on our 2nd play with 4 players, I think that's a minimum, the more the merrier I suspect. It's quite easy to fit 6 people around this game because there's little more then a hand of cards for each player and then a board and components for that. Quite easy to bring in new players because the game is mostly open and straight forward. This game drips with theme and it's more of an experience to play, you don't know what will happen in each game. This feeling is enhanced by the fact that it's a cooperative game but knowing that one or more player might be a cylon, or might become one later, makes the game more fun to play (especially as a cylon). With 4+ players there's a chance of 2 or 3 cylons working together, so you win on loose as a team.

Ever wanted to call your best friend a "Frakking Toaster" and then send him to the brig so that you have more time to muck up the gullible humans plans? This is the game for you. The game itself is not very hard to learn or play, but the true game is the game of cat and mouse that you play as you feel out each player trying to determine if they have a knife pointed at your back while they smile to your face. Great fun, though I rarely have a large enough group to pull this game out.

I've played three games.  One game was an epic experience in intrigue, crisis management, and victory (or defeat) by the slimmest of margins.  Awesome.  One game was a cakewalk for the humans where most people did nothing on their turns but collect cards.  Sucky.  The last game started out as the previous game did, but then 4 Cylon fleets came out in a row and raped every last civilian ship on the board.  There was absolutely no way the humans could have won and the Cylon victory had nothing to do with how they played.  I think this game needs a stacked deck ala Pandemic in order to avoid the above tragedy.  Incidentally, I have never been a Cylon yet.  Boo.

Edit: Lots of plays since then.  The Cylon Fleet board is necessary for this to be a game at all.  It seems like the Cylons have a distinct advantage, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
An excellent hidden-traitor game based on the 2004 re-imagining of the classic 70s TV show.

The humans are fleeing the cylons and need to find a safe place before the game-controlled and secret cylons manage to destroy them. Though as in the series, no safe place is safe for long: each box (Base, Pegasus, Exodus and Daybreak) covers each of the four series respectively and each one adds exciting new mechanics into the game.

Highly recommended, though it may take a few games before your players are used to bluffing and spotting bluffs enough.

Be warned though: this game is brutal for the humans. We once played a three-player game where the only cylon card was not drawn and still lost, and a four-player game where the cylon mis-read his card and thought he was human, and we still lost. Out of all my games I have only seen the humans win three times. But we all still love the game and enjoy playing it regardless (and most of us are disappointed when we are cylons).

One of the coolest mechanics I've seen in a game. Secretly working against everyone while playing as a Cylon is extremely difficult - you find yourself attempting to reason your way out of situations, frame other players, and perform "good" actions in public just so others don't find you out.

Playing as a human reminds me of the game "Paranoia." You know there's a traitor... and you're PRETTY sure it's everyone around you. You find yourself over-analyzing, and attempting to trap people into making decisions that will reveal themselves.

I tried this game twice. I had never seen the show. After trying the game, my wife and I went out and began watching because the concept was so cool.

Awesome. Played it twice so far. We messed up the loyalty deck in the first game (there were only 2 humans in the end, though I think we would have won it if we had played it out). In the second game, the humans lost after we'd jumped 4 range factors. Our viper patrols were more or less wiped out and we got very few jump cards...awesome but hard!

OK -- so, I've played this one 4 times and 3 times we or I have messed up the loyalty deck...what gives?

This game truly is brilliant. So, in the last game, we've got 8 jump factors and have loads of room on the dials -- looks like a clean human win...within 10 minutes (no exaggeration), the frakkin' toasters have their force pool on the map and have driven our jump prep back to the beginning...they take out about 5 civilian ships on one turn and that's it...humans lose...again! Never seen a human win to this point, but it doesn't matter -- the game is so great!

12 plays and my record... 0-12!! And I've never seen a human victory except the one time I was a Cylon...still, a great, great game!

Finally a victory...on game 15. 1-14...not a great record, but still a great game. Pegasus expansion without the New Caprica board is the way to go forward. Admiral Cain's special power to draw a Kobol card was the decisive move.

Back to form on game 16 - losing with the Cylons this time. And to think, with me being Chief Tyrol going over to the toasters, I was certain that Galactica was doomed...ha!

Game 17 - I'm now 2-15! And as the humans again! A particularly exciting game. Admiral Cain's special power again proves decisive. Pegasus expansion definitely seems to swing the game's dynamic a bit towards the humans. In this game, the Cylons struggled to get their full powers to bear against Galactica. Human solidarity was very strong. Starbuck as Cylon struggled to thwart the humans and the Cylon leader's objective was to help humanity. Still, as is typical of this game, even with these factors, it was a tough run for the humans.

The problem with Battlestar Galactica is it's a long game that comes down to one or two key moments, like how a President chooses not to execute a Cylon or how a new minted Admiral will choose to nuke the civilian ships that he has spent all game putting into close quarter. That can be some great fun, but the rest of game feels like a slog of tedious work.

In the end, I don't think it a good work to pay off ratio.

I think this game is poorly designed.  There's a hidden player mechanic to it, and it's very difficult to keep hidden.  One example of the difficulty: The player cards that tell you who you are and whether you're a Cylon are smaller than the other cards.  If you are a Cylon, and only if you are a Cylon, you will need to refer to your card during the game. 

There are other mechanics that have issues as well.  I can't see why you would use/do some of the options in the game.  It's a good idea, and uses a world I love, but it's clunky at best.

I think this game could use a second edition to clean up some of the issues with design and mechanics.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Only one play but the game is fun, tense, every decision is hard. After you jump to hyperspace you get a little leeway from the cylon ships, but due to crisis cards, one minute you're navigating peacefully with no cylon ships around and the next minute a swarm of cylon ships come out of no where (actually come from crisis cards :p ) and problems start again until the fleet can jump again.

Didn't find the game to drag with 3 players.

The game is hard for the humans so I suggest using the variant in the rules that you start with all dials with 2 extra resources.

By far one of the best games ever produced.
This semi-cooperative (traitor) game is full of tension, intrigue and steeped very deeply with plot and story.  Easily one of the best translations of a tv series or movie to a board game.

The game feels like you are actually in the BSG universe.  The designers pegged that feeling dead on.  I forsee this game getting play rotation for quite some time.  It is a timeless game which I think deserves to be in any collection.  Definitely one of my top ten.

RATING: 9.2
What an exceptional game! To have this and Pandemic hit the stores within a 12 month period is has really brightened my entire year. The traitor element allows for some potentially wonderful and subtle 'performances' by players - something that will appeal to both gamers and non-gamers alike. Who wouldn't welcome the chance to play the 'agent provocateur' - pitting the hapless remnants of humanity against themselves in an air of suspicion and half-truths? A remarkably faithful conversion of the TV show to the board capturing much of the shows nuance. Along with Pandemic, my joint favourite games, quite outstanding in their own ways.

I really wanted to like this game more since the theme is fantastic, and I'm a HUGE fan of BSG.  The bits are great, the art is great, and I do have some fun playing the game.  However, there always seems to be some unnecessary lulls in the game and times where it doesn't seem like it matters or it isn't clear which action makes sense to take.  Overall, I'll play it if my group wants to bring it out, but if given the choice, there are many other games that take this long I'd rather play.

EDIT:After a few more plays, the rules stick with you, great replayability value, every play is somewhat different and exciting till the very last turn. Quite luck-prone but that is actually a good thing here, to me at least. One of my favorite games.

Played a number of times, and have yet to see a human victory. Once the half way point is reached, and the Cylons come out into the open, the game moves from being functional and fun, to an exercise in frustration. Unless you're a Cylon, of course.

I finally came to grips with the fact that I don't enjoy traitor-mechanic driven games.  I grow tired quickly of trying to convince people of who the traitors are.  The game is a good entry for this genre.  Just not my cup of tea.  I sold my copy.
Update Rating: 7 -> 5.

____ First Game with 4 players that took 4 hours (including rule explanation).  It certainly was on the long side but the good thing is that it didn't feel that long.  It could be that I was on vacation so I had a lot of disposable time and that I was also talking to friends in the house that were not playing the game.  The game is pretty simple to play but there are a lot of rules to keep track of.  
____ The game is all about a group of humans in a spaceship trying to find their new home.  However, one or more cylons can be some of the humans, whose sole purpose is to prevent the humans from reaching their new home.  This is what makes the game unique as people work together, there is a lot of second guessing and acusations and sub-optimal play from people that keeps the game from being just as a puzzle since this is a coop game.  I certainly enjoyed my time as everyone was accusing that each one is a cylon.  I think the longer the cylon reveals himself as a cylon the better the game becomes because the whole atmosphere of intrigue is maintained.  This game that we played the cylon revealed himself too soon and us humans were too efficient since we know we can trust ourselves completely.  This also made the game flat.

A solid cooperative game, very much depenedent of who you play with - but this genre of games has this trait as immanent. If I am to play a co-op, I choose BSG.

I think I waited a decent amount of time to rate this game.  I had the chance to play off other peoples copies several times and I have to say it's amazing.  The only downer I could possibly give the game is the length of play, but I don't think that should hurt since I never felt bored or wished the time had gone faster.  The re-playability is amazing and the pure fun of trying to figure out who is screwing you at the table is fantastic. Ordered my copy

Maybe its the honeymoon period BUT its awesome! Great mix of theme with game play (very DUNE-esque)

OK the honeymoon period is over BUT I still love it.
The base game captures the flavor of the series.  It is a lot of fun.  More fun with people who know the show,rather than the game.  If you play with those who "KNOW" the game and try to dictate everything ARE ANNOYING. People hate you and hope you never procreate

Too many games try to incorporate too many systems to get a varied feel. In this one, all the varied systems come together as different mechanisms by which the ship can be defended or sabotaged. This gives the BSG tremendous depth and replay value.

It's a nice co-operative game, and the hidden cylon element creates lots of tension. If every players watched the TV show, the game experience will be enormously enhanced.
I am not a big fan of coops, and sometimes BSG drags a little too long for my taste, but with the right people (you know, the roleplaying kind...) it can be a blast.

Initial Impressions: A very highly thematic game. I can almost hear the theme music in the background (does that make me a cylon?). My favorite aspect of the game is the traitor mechanism. Once the traitor is revealed the tension and pace of the game really ramps up and the game becomes a race to achieve goals the quickest. Playtime is the perfect length for me.

10 Plays: Having played a number of other traitor games, I find the length and cardplay of this game to just the right amount in order to facilitate the buildup of deduction and paranoia. I'm still enjoying this game very much.

I have only played this once, but when I did it was epic and that one play through was probably my favorite gaming experience to date.  I know there are more streamlined traitor games these days, but I want the epic feel mixed with the traitor, and BSG has that.  If I keep playing this and it gets solved, I can see it going down.  For now though, such good memories!

First game in a while that game me a "wow" factor upon playing it.  Rating after one game.  Played a friend's copy, and went out the next day to get it.  It is that good.  

Tension, tough decisions, dripping with theme, and hunting for the Cylons makes for fantasic player interaction.  

Rating adjusted after 3rd play to a "10".  Taught my wife, her brother and spouse to play and they loved it.

BSG has some fun elements to it like trying to find who is a cylon and the different roles involved.  The biggest problem is its length.  It starts to get stale about 2/3 through for me, and by the time we either win or lose I don't much care anymore.

BSG is one of "those" games people will often either love or hate without a whole lot of in between. But another thing I find is that people often decide whether or not they love or hate it based on one experience. The problem with that is that perhaps not unlike other board games, one round of BSG can differ vastly than the next. I like to describe BSG as a game that has provided some of my favorite gaming experiences, (some of the best) & some of my least favorite experiences, (some the worst)!
BSG is a well designed game, but not an easy one. It suffers at times from the fact that many of it's teachers are woefully inadequate at teaching the many rules and intricacies of the game.
This is a difficult cooperative game with a hidden betrayer(s), sometimes the "bad guys" can win by simply not helping much and allowing the game to beat the players or by just giving that extra little push towards oblivion at the end.
You don't need to be a fan of the mini-series to be a fan of the game, in fact I've never seen a single episode of the show. (But I'm sort of interested now as a result of playing the game). 
The game can suffer a little when played with an unbalanced group. I prefer playing with more experienced players but will admit that I am still learning many of the games intricacies.
I also think this game suffers when whoever is teaching it takes an hour or more to teach (I've sat through that and thought I would hate the game as a result).

I do not know why this game is so popular. In the test rounds the social aspect of the game never comes alive.

Underneath the hidden role mechanism, there isn't much content. At some point during the game, the roles are revealed, destroying all the tension there was. It's a boring team vs. team experience with low agency and high randomness. You might as well play The Resistance.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Similar mechanisms to 'Shadows over Camelot' but plays quit differently. First of all it's less abstract - it is still a card managing game but each character and location has different abilities. The skill resolution system, where everybody can secretly support or oppose the skill check, is great. The best thing is probably the 'Cylon Sleeper Agents' rule which causes a lot of additional tension.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This is probably the best game to come out in 10 years.

Original comments:  Preordered on Amazon.  Never seen the show before, but all the reviews make me think this will be up my alley.

Edit:  In the last 3 weeks I have begun and watched up through season 3 of Battlestar Galactica.  This game is now a must-own.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I have not watched the series although I do enjoy Scifi. This game looks good but felt slow with 5 players and the Pegasus expansion. Frankly, it was mostly bored. The Cylon had the secret objective to help the humans, while halfway through the game I became a Cylon. Not being familiar, I stayed secret and tried to hurt via crisis cards, but was mostly unsuccessful. Later it was clear I should have declared as I would have done more damage that way. I would be willing to give the game another shot but I'm not feeling it!

Our game group tends to enjoy coops, and the sentiment toward BG was no exception.  A lot of finger pointing, arguing, laughing, and betrayal made for a very enjoyable outing.  A lot more to consider than say SoC or Pandemic, and plenty of extra ways to throw a wrench into the works while playing as the traitor.  Definitely, the more the merrier.  The only blip was that it was the first time any of us had played, and a few rules weren't played exactly as written, however we didn't know at the time and it certainly didn't detract from the fun we were having..."Cylon!!!"..."Human!!!"  May upgrade rating upon further play with appropriate rules.

A fantastic 'hardcore' party game. Players assume role of a single person aboard the Galactica.

Components and board: Fantasy Flight quality, as always.

Just an all around fantastic game. I was a bit intimidated at first, as the board looks extremely busy and there are numerous sets of cards, but after a couple of turns everyone picks up the rythm very easily. The design and balance are outstanding. One thing I must say is that very few games will be alike. The last two games we played were polar extremes in outcome. In the second to last, the humans won with little difficulty through a fortunate series of long jumps and almost no Base Star appearances. In the last game, the Galactica, pummeled by two Base Stars and having a Cylon revealing very early to add sabotage to the overall damage, was not even able to make a single jump before being destroyed!

Hard to be objective about this game since it’s my absolute no.1. I love it, I played it dozens of times, there is no other game I like more than this one. Made by one of my favorite game designers, based on one of my favorite TV shows. It’s just great.
That beeing said, the basic game has flaws. And quite a few of them actually. Three to be precise. 
First, I really dislike the sympathizer mechanic. It seems unfair and takes away the fun for one of the players halfway through the game. There is nothing worse than saying „sorry, you don’t play the deception game with us anymore, you are a cylon/human now and we all know about it”.
Second, it is not that interesting to be a revealed cylon. Almost literally nothing to do but the same, one thing over and over again. 
Third, the space combat is very random. There are games that you won’t get even one cylon ship around Galactica during the whole game. You just cruise through the galaxy calmly with a sense of… well, that nothing is happening. Plus, the pilots feel kind of useless when that happens.
I do need to write that all those flaws are beeing „fixed” with the expansions. The first by Daybreak (adding the mutineer instead of the sympathizer) and the last two by Exodus (cylon fleet), making the game perfect.

What else can be said about this game other then a pure gem! Granted, it can and sometimes will take a while to play the game but the investment can be worth it. People have said that games like the Resistance and others have made Battlestar obsolete, but I say NEH! Sure, those game can give you a traitor feel in a short amount of time, but with the added time in Battlestar your are more invested into the game and the loyalties of the people. The betrayals are more soul crushing and the victories are more grandiose.

Hard to know where to start on this one. I purposely have avoided this one for most of its life until now. but I have wanted to make a run of it. I am so glad to have had the chance. If you are a fan of the show, this will put you over the top, if you are not you may want to go and check it out. Do yourself a favor and just play another round of this, After you watch the miniseries, all of what transpires after will pale in comparison to your own tormented time in the universe. The tension can be really high, and the mechanic of knowing that there is a traitor or two in the mix is brilliant. The fact that this one leans so heavily on the group playing it for timbre is in itself remarkable, and that it puts you through the grinder is also. Play it, if you are a fan of or hate or have never seen, the series upon which this game is based, play it. everyone in that group will love it, only set aside hours and hours for it, you will not be sorry!

The great thing about this co-op game is that not everyone is working together. This changes the game from a solitaire experience to a trust game. For the best experience players need to realize that it doesn't always benefit them to help in the beginning half of the game, because they may become a cylon in the latter half. Otherwise, I find the humans will usually win.

This is my favorite game - bar none.  The game's use of a Cylon traitor creates a suspense that is hard to find in many other games.  Yes, the game can be long and it has many moving parts, but the end result is an experience that isn't easily forgotten.

One of the (very) few games inspired by a TV series that actually let you "live" the atmosphere of the series. The game is nearly perfect. 5 players is the perfect spot. (I can't give 10 to this beauty because with different players count loses appeal).

RATING: 9
Awesome thematic experience. I love the way it plays, the way characters and the feel are ported from the show...

Playing a cylon is extremely cool, and playing as a human is a great cooperative game.

I've come to realize I love characters that can pilot a viper :D
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Well what a disappointment.

Seems like the fun of the game depends from the cards.I as a pilot was literally playing only cards each round for 4 hours.Wow that was a lot of fun :(.Sometimes i flew out and destroy spaceships.Then i was cyclon and cant do literally shit becouse we jumped too far to the end of the game.Needed to win in like 3 turns as a cylon and i was alone.Had 2 5 point cards and i need to go for morale since they had it at 4.alone againts 4 players i was outbided.

we were plaing with exodus and pegasu expansions.

-the game will need some homeruling to be more fun
-some characters are much more fun to play
-toooo long for what it is.
-the lenght will suck out any tension from the game

Well i rather play 5 rounds of resistance:avalon than this.
Too much unneeded souce around it again.

I dont think that semi coop traitor mechanic is good in this kind of game concept.It makes the game too long.

I will try it again thou.

A great game. However, because of having to draw cards for enemies to enter the battlefield, you can either be incredibly underwhelmed or incredibly overwhelmed. Although always being the Cylon helps quite a lot.

RATING: 8
Complicated to explain and difficult to get the hang of on the first play, but with a dedicated group this game explodes with awesomeness. The mechanics of the game are actually remarkably simple, but the traitor aspect colours every other part of the game and makes it a big, fun paranoia-fest. The fact that it's based on one of the best sci-fi TV shows ever made is icing on the cake. The length of the game is the main downside, and though the ending will often be tense and dramatic, it can sometimes be a big letdown if the good guys are looking hosed or the cylons handled their hidden role badly. It's tempting to recommend shorter hidden-role games like Avalon or One-Night Werewolf in BSG's place, but nothing quite matches BSG for epicness when it works. As a sidenote, I can't see myself ever needing an expansion, as it feels complete as is and definitely doesn't need to run any longer.

Very well themed semi coop game. The infiltrated cylon mechanism creates an aura of paranoia around every action which feels right for this game. Solid gameplay with enough variety to keep things interesting for all players. Bad point is the Sympathizer rule used for 4 and 6 player games. Someone needs to come up with a good variant here as the original rules can be easily manipulated to greatly favour the humans. Plus it is no fun to become a sympathizer if it would actually happen. Also as in most FFG rules from this era it's almost impossible to find stuff. Bad index and sub optimal layout are the main causes.

Have the first two expansions which add some fun modules to the game which I would never play without. But also a lot which I will never ever use.  It also adds some nice bling to the game. Man do I love those basestars.

This game seems perfectly designed for the fans of the show.  However, as someone who has never seen an episode, it felt a little long for what it was and a few of the mechanics felt a little clunky.  It seemed that the cylons needed little to no subterfuge in order to win, because the game is so heavily weighted in their favor anyways.  I'm willing to play again, but I definitely don't feel the need to purchase my own copy.  It's just a little too complex, and yet seemingly a little too luck-based, for my taste.

RATING: 4
Initial rating.

Enjoyed the game with 4 players quite well.  Probably better with more - which could fill in the difficult 5-6 spot quite nicely.

Update:

Revealed the cylon (4P) on the first crisis check.  The rest of the game was meh.  This would be better had it been designed for more players, such that some other mechanics are shortened/streamlined, and the cylons revealing/causing paranoia was extended.

1-29-09:

First 5-player.  Flows better in some ways, but not unpredictably so.  I don't know why I enjoy this game, but I do.

4-22-09:

The first part of the game is very interesting; it becomes steadily less interesting as it progresses, and not interesting at all after the cylons have disembarked Galactica.

I run on a campaign of always human.  6 games, no cylon.

I have about an hour of fun for a 3-5 hour game.  Not a good thing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun game but can take a very long time to play

Also not good for inexperienced cloak & dagger players as it can be easy for players to inadvertently give themselves away, and ruin the game.

Cylon players can be especially mean if they know how best to maximise the damage of their subterfuge

I really like this game and enjoy it once in a while. Normally I am not inclined to like games like this. Its long but not much happens, its random and fiddly. It has a lot of minor rules added to the important concepts and it is a social deduction game. Still I really like it. The level of tension is just great, some tests are easy, but you never know what the traitor, or cylon might do. Every round is tense and in the later stages of the game, every turn may be the last. It just hast the right level of tension to be really enjoyable.

All the fun and intrigue of a 25-minute game spread out over three hours! I cannot understand how this is fun as the excitement of figuring out who is evil is bogged down by minutiae and procedure.

Objectively, I would say this is a good game design.  It achieves its intent with clever mechanics and accurately recreates the tone of the TV show.

Played it at last and it does live up to its reputation. It is a tough co-op and I can see how it would be tough for the humans to win even without a Cylon. With a Cylon it is a real nightmare but either way it is a lot of fun.

Update: Couple more plays and it is still enjoyable (have won as humans now). Some of the shine is coming off but it is still worth a play.

RATING: 4
I have been forced to play Galactica twice this last Saturday and hated it: I ain’t interested in the new series, so I guess I lack the necessary identification with the characters, which is mandatory to fully understand the complex game mechanics and its theme.

My first run was pretty short: I happened to be a cylon and was immediately discovered in the first turn by the player after myself, who used her character’s special ability to check my alignment and give an executive order to another player, whose special ability was to shoot any player. I was shot and in less than a couple of minutes after the game started I found myself a cylon with almost nothing to do hence.
The second (forced) run was a better experience for I was human, yet I had little to do all the time, except for drawing some cards and giving executive orders to the other players when my turns came: it was a pretty boring play.

Nonetheless, what I disliked the most about this game is that «French Revolution atmosphere» it creates: Galactica should be a cooperative game, yet nobody can trust his fellow players for anybody could be an infiltrator. So you play in an atmosphere of suspicion, distrusting everyone and inciting others to do your bidding: this way all of the game’s dynamics come down to a «do this or else you’re a cylon» statement by the more experienced or motivated players.

All in all, you have to really like the series in order to enjoy (and understand) this game.
I surely didn’t.

A game that perfectly captures the paranoia and deception of the first couple seasons of Battlestar Galactica.  There is alot going on in the game...but overall it's pretty simple to digest the rules.  The game can last hours, but it's well worth it.  Everyone needs to be into the game and this should rise above the table.  This game isn't really en vogue so much these days, but it is still one helluva design.  Certainly worth playing every now and then.

RATING: 7.8
Dead of Winter is possibly the better and more streamlined game but I really love the theme of this one, plus the traior mechanic works better. It does outstay it's welcome but even so each game thus far has delivered a huge dose of paranoia-fuelled enjoyment. The squabbling and finger-pointing begins early here - before the game has even begun - and that's because everyone wants to play Gaius 'Butterfingers' Baltar.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
UPDATE: I have to drop the rating (9 -> 8) just because of game length.  Most games still run near the 4 hour mark, even with experienced players.

---

I have 2 gripes: First, the game is too long.  Most 4 player games I have played have run over 4 hours.  Second, I find the mechanics of the game to be rather clunky.

But that said, this is a real fun game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Lots of great ideas in this game, and it really feels like you are stuck in battlestar. I've played 6 times without one human win though which is sort of frustrating. I have the expansions and I think they do add to the game, as there are points when the game feels a bit boring. 
Also, it seems like its hard to keep the interest up while you are waiting for your turn to come around. 
As I have felt with other games, i feel that this is a bit too long of a game for what it is. 
I am going to continue giving it a chance, however with better games cropping up in my group, eclipse, le havre, power grid, etc i'm not sure how much time its going to get.

The shine wore off this one fairly quickly, and the expansions make it worse, not better. I'll still play it if other people are getting a game going, but I'm not buying it, and I won't be proposing it at game nights. You basically need five players to even bother with it, and at that point, I'd rater just play The Resistance, and get several games in the same time as a single play of BSG.

RATING: 4.25
I have a strange relationship to this game. I played it and loved it, and playing it made me want to watch the series. Since watching the first season, I haven't wanted to play the game again.

The game itself is fairly well thought-out, though I think it's over-rated by fans of the series. I don't think it's anything particularly original or amazing, though the secret bidding system is an innovative way to hide the traitor. I'm not a huge fan of co-ops, either.

I'm not a space fan or a co-op fan but this was decent. Once the game got going it was interesting to figure out who the cylons were and how to deal with it.  I would play again but I'm not going to drive this to the table.

Okay, up to a 6 but only with the right group and a once in a year game, for me.

A personal favorite of mine, even if, as the cliche goes, you have to play it with the right people. Playtime can also be an issue, particularly for a teaching game, or if the Cylons get outed too fast. Keeping at least one Cyclon hidden is a must for keeping the game interesting in the middle stages.

Wow. Almost a perfect game experience.  Only game i've ever played 3 nights in a row (and enjoyed each play immensely). Mechanics and rules manage to capture the pacing and tension of the tv series amazingly well, yet knowing the show is no drawback (many friends have played it w/ no BSG knowledge and were equally hooked).  Only length keeps it from seeing more table time.

Quite a commitment to do a full playthrough, but the experience is just too good to not do it once in a while.  The traitor element adds a layer of tension that makes it a truly great experience each time.  Highly recommended with 4 to 5 people.  With 3, it just loses that added "something" that really makes it work.

It remains to be seen how well this game will go over with gaming fans who aren't also BSG fans.  However, for those who are familiar with the show, this does SUCH a good job of capturing the feel of the characters and interactions.  This is what Shadows Over Camelot could have been - a really tense, interesting game of cooperation with paranoia and suspicion in every turn.  Lots of fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
As far as coop games go, Shadows Over Camelot is better.  I was very disappointed in this game.  The traitor mechanic in BSG is good, but other than that, after 4 hours of playing, we lost and realized that there was nothing we could have done differently to change the outcome.  Our Crisis cards came up midway through the game in this order:  Water shortage, Food Shortage, Food Shortage, Water Shortage.  Then a few turns later, another Food Shortage finished us off.  Since there is absolutely NO way of getting more food and no way of preventing the loss of food, there was no change in strategy or gameplay decision that anyone could have made to change the outcome.  Someone said, "well, that's in the spirit of the show."  Perhaps that's true, except that doesn't make a fun game.  4 hours lost.

In Shadows over Camelot, yes, you might get slammed with a lot of mean cards all at once, but at least there is always SOMETHING you can do about it.  You can combat any loss, mitigate any mishap, prevent a catastrophe. Not so in BSG.

Being a fan of the new TV series I was skeptic about this game....and I was wrong. The mechanic is really enjoyable and my group had alot of fun playing it. The Kobol/Clicks mechanic should have been tuned better since we always have a rather easy game at the beginning and an almost impossible one at the end (just after the sleeper agent phase). Recommended to everyone.

This is a very fun co-op game.  Our group really enjoys playing these types of co-ops.  The traitor aspect that BSG and Shadows has seems to be what draws everyone in.  This one does take a while to play but I think that is in part because we have played it twice in 10 months.  If we played a little more often I'm sure we'd remember more of the rules and play time would be cut down dramatically.

Never saw the show, but if you want an experience that gets you as close to the set as possible, I'd say this is it.

Still...both Cylons won that first 5-player game!

The card system is interesting, and the way the game estabilishes traitor-paranoia works really well, but too much of the game ends up relying on the crisis cards, how they are distributed.

I'd much rather play Werewolf.

This is a pretty tricky game, some quite different roles and a lot of characters to select your playerts from give it more variety than the base Shadows game, but having only played it the once so far, I was not enormously impressed with it bringing anything new to the co-op genre, other than a TV show tie in.

RATING: 6
That was probably the most memorable board game that I have ever played!  The accusations and crazy logic was flying every which way... My newly acquired sleeper cylon status had my head swimming with schemes and looking forward to every new crisis card... And when the second cylon was finally revealed after our success, it was completely awesome!  Oh, what a great night!  But, playing this game with strangers would be dry and nerve-wracking... Even with good friends I kept worrying about feelings getting hurt.  This is one of those "games" where the machinations are just there to encourage the experience, and if all of the player's don't make their best effort to enhance the experience the machinations by themselves won't make for a fun time.

One of my three favourite games. A game that manages to be both co-operative and combatative, with multiple routes to winning or losing and buckets of theme.

RATING: N/A
I really enjoy this, and I'll happily play it, but having played it a fair bit, there are a couple of things that can grate a bit. I don't like playing with someone who's aggressive in trying to convince people that someone's a Cylon - it feels like it can cross the line into intimidation. I also think the game only really works at its best with 6 people - with 4, it's extremely difficult for the Cylon to win, particularly if they don't learn they're a Cylon until after the midpoint. With 5, it's very difficult for the humans to win, particularly if the Cylons can reveal early. 6 feels very much like the sweet spot for this.

When the game runs well, with a nice group of people, I love it as much as I do Stone Age and Arkham Horror.

RATING: 10
This is the best game with a traitor element I know. The tension about the identity of the cylon just sits over the table; I've never been less than fully engaged in a game of Battlestar. I am a fan of the show and I don't know how one can fully appreciate the game without a familiarity with the show (though some who haven't seen it claim to love the game). That said, the game is so good that it's worth making time to see an episode or two just to gain access to the drama the game can provide.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
What I Like:
The tension is unbeatable in a close game. It is as advertised. I enjoy the closeness the game keeps to it's theme. And I REALLY enjoy team games, traitor or not. The rules are simple enough to teach as you play, and nd there are plenty of surprises along the way.

What I Don't Like:
Play time. It's hard to get in under 3 hours, especially with new players. While I feel that there is little downtime between turns, the game seems a bit long for it's complexity level. 

I's starting to feel the weight of the game in the play time. While I overlooked it early on, it's now a bigger factor than I previously rated. In many ways, it's a game that prevents itself from being played due to it's playtime, which is unfortunate. 

Why I still own it:
It's an experience, like a murder mystery. Everyone leaves the table with a narrative.

RATING: 9
This is the first game that I've felt I should rate a 10.  Yet the odd thing about it is that most of makes it deserving of a 10 isn't due to what is in the box, but rather what you bring to it.  The amount of fun you have with it will come from the group you play it with.  My group accuses each other of being cylons in real life, so you can see where we might have a field day with this game.  The mechanics themselves are rather simple, and not all that exciting on paper, but are necessary to leave the room needed to make this game what it is.

If played with the right players, who can pull of a little bit of drama, the paranoid atmosphere is really incredible.  This is the sort of game that makes me appreciate why I play board games.

Edit-Lowering this to a 9.  Playing with the same group sort limits just how repayable it is, but it's still fun.

RATING: 7
Finally got to play this game. The TV series was one of the first series that got me binge watching until deep in the night on working days, so I really wanted to try this one.

My first play was with five players and I chose Gaius Baltar. Right of the bat I got the two Ceylon cards and to make matters worse, two players got to filter crisis cards, to skip over the worst ones during the game. An uphill battle for sure, but I got enough confusion in to stretch the game to three hours. I did lose though, as jump cards with high numbers were drawn. Came still pretty close.

This is certainly not a game to play every week, but once in a while I think it's a very enjoyable experience, especially if you were a fan of the series remake. You do have to have the right crowd, because of the role playing aspect. The game thrives when people are busy scheming and accusing each other. It's still a bit long for a hidden traitor game and therefore probably not for everyone.

Provisional rating at 7 until I get a few more plays in.

RATING: 9.5
I folded and bought this.  Guess I could not hold out as well as I thought!
Ran my first play of this, liked what I saw.  I do believe that the players have a huge impact on how much people enjoy this game.  With players that get into their roles it's going to be fantastic!

Interesting, I've been putting a considerable amount of idle time towards thinking about this game.  That bodes well for it, as it's been a long time since a game grabbed me that way!

I'm just loving the paranoia and player interaction of this game.  Creating suspicion amongst the players is great fun, and I really enjoy the back and forth with the other players!!  Amazing game, and it only gets better with more players!

Feb 15, 2010 -- Dropped to a 9.  Note that my rating on this game is for the five player game only, with is 90%+ of my plays.  With a number of players != 5 the game is lower. likely 1 7.5 to 8.0.

As much as I enjoyed this game, space considerations and desire to play sent it to a new owner.  I'd still play with the right group though!

Very thematic game.  I tend to strongly dislike the mechanics of a game this thematic.  This is no exception.

If you are a big fan of the licensed property and like heavier games then this might be for you, but for the life of me I don't understand it's popularity.

Still there are much worse games I could play so with the right friends and some serious pleading I might suffer another play.

RATING: 9
This game has one of the best hidden traitor systems for a co-opertive game. On top of that you feel the actual pressure of what it must be like on the Battlestar. A perfect recreation of the tension and characters of a TV show. I'm not sure any other licensed property game has hit the nail on the head as well as this one.  However it's not all sunshine. The game takes awhile to play, the setup is tedious with all the fiddly bits, and some people just aren't going to understand if they aren't a fan of the show.

I can't get enough of this game and can't find enough people to play it. I find it really easy to get my family into playing it whenever we gather though. It usually gets derogatory comments the first time I bust it out but by the time it ends they want more.

8-27 : 5 player. Roslin, Starbuck, Admiral Adama, Baltar & Helo, Roslin cylon before sleeper, Starbuck (myself) cylon after sleeper. Both got good reveals off. Humans lost from running out of fuel at 5 on the track to Kobol. Had a 3 jump but insufficient fuel.

PBF Game: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/839765/bsg-295-a-disease-of-hoping

9-2 : 5 player. Roslin, Tigh, Baltar, Apollo (newbie), Chief (newbie). Both of the newbies got cylon cards at the sleeper phase. They both got successful reveals off but only because a brig check failed. They successfully briged me after I declared Martial Law but it was after we had already gone the 8 distance so Admiral was pretty useless at that point. They had convinced Roslin that I was a cylon after the martial law. Resources were all in the red but we got the jump off after the 8 distance and Humans won.

3-3 : 6 player w/ expansions. To Kobol, no Conflicted Loyalties but had Final Five cards. Played as Cally, others were Anders, Roslin, Zarek, Dee, and Bill Adama. Used my OPG to execute Dee turns out she was Cylon. I was Human Final Five. Humans won with only 1 population left. Raiders took out 6 civilian ships on the last turn right before we jumped to the victory.

Game gets stronger with each successive play.  The brilliance of the game actually seems to lie in the length of time it takes to play.  The longer the game, usually the more suspicions there are.  The shortened version of the game seems to remove a lot of the fun.  

This is just an unbelievably great game, looking forward to more.

More so than other games, one negative minded player can just flat out ruin the experience.

RATING: 9.5
I never really get tired of this game.  One of the few where I can lose horribly and still have a great time every play.

To me, this game has perfected the hidden traitor mechanic.  It gives plenty of options for players to subtly sabotage their "teammates" without having to give up their identity as a traitor.  There are even plenty of mechanics to allow you to attempt to "frame" another player, or to provide limited access to incriminating information.

Amazing.

With 30+ unlogged plays, I absolutely love this game; so many fond memories.

Awesome job of feeling exactly like the show, and balancing the different characters.  It seems impossible for the humans to win with a 6 player default setup, and with our jury-rigged 7-player setup (3 cyclons and dials +2).  I assume it plays best with 5, or adjusting the dials until it is just right?  I hate how fiddly the game is with all the pieces, but mostly worth it...

RATING: 9
A cooperative game that actually works and a franchise tie-in that doesn't suck! Surprising on a number of levels, this game is very thematic, plays smoothly, maintains tension throughout, and is absorbing and fun to play. On the negative side, it can be repetitive and long. If you are enjoying the overall experience however, this is not necessarily a bad thing (and if you were a fan you will enjoy this) owing to its marvelous capturing of the theme of a "rag-tag human fleet fleeing from the relentless Cylons bent on their destruction."

The sequence of events can spell the difference between victory for the humans or their annihilation at the hands of the Cylons, but clever and cooperative play can give them a fighting chance. This game lends itself more than many to a spirit of role-playing that adds an extra layer to the whole experience - but that could be predicated on players who were really "into" the TV series.

I'm impressed after two plays!
++++++
Back to the game after quite an interval. I was struck by the re-immersion in the theme which is captured so very well but; on the other hand, if you weren't a big fan of the series this may mean little and the long(ish) repetitive nature of the game might detract. Thus perhaps not a game for everyone - but so far, in my book, it is the best "cooperative" game system out there!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Never seen the series, but from the spirit of mistrust and "forced co-operation" it must be an interesting one. A fun game if players can stand some false accusion and treason. Clever game mechanics make it work out that you never really know whom to trust.

RATING: 7
Hated it first time - I don't watch the TV series and missed all the references.  "Who's that...what does she do...I thought they were called 'Cyclons'...I thought Starbuck was a bloke" and so on.  So I sent the first and second games in a state of ignorance (thank heaven I wasn't a Cylon).  Last play was much better when I managed to separate the mechanics from the fiction.  Better played apart from a group of BS fanboys to be honest and if this happens the score might go up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
As a fan of the (new) series this is a '10' for me, it's great, bit of role-play, bit of paranoia and mind games and you get to play BattleStar Galactica.

If you don't know the series, it's not going to be such a great experience as you'll have less of a hook to the theme and the images and quotes on the card won't mean anything.

Game play, variable - experience depends entirely on the players, with some groups this could be a total nightmare of long drawn out tedium - but with the right group it shines.

You need to realise it is a team game (rather than co-op) and it's an experience game, if you go in with the mindset you want to just optimise your play to 'win' it's going to fall flat.

But I love it ...

*** update, 10 plays later, still love it :)

*** 2nd Update, played this over and over since getting it (12 plays now) and still love it. Made me want to go and rewatch the tv series again. Seems Cylons have the easier time of it, but that is because it's harder to play the humans. 

Humans can win, but they need to use executive orders (so doubling the actions players are doing) and pick and choose which crisis to try to pass. Also helps to weed out the cylons quickly, or at least have the cylons running scared so they actually help in an attempt to remain hidden.

*** 3rd Update

Lost count of plays, still love it - BUT it depends massively on the group playing, with the wrong group this can bomb massively.

RATING: 8
Really cool suspenseful game.  You don't know it but half of you are traitors and then again maybe not quite.

This is one of the most interesting designs I have epxeriences in a game.

I am not convinced that the game is properly balanced yet at the way it plays out seems lop sided to the Cylon side however there is enough entertainment value to continue to play 5-10 more times to earnestly figure it out.  I suggest adding some additional room to each of the four dials for players to have some padding on a failed game(from the humans point of view...)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.3
First game was thematic and intense - would rate a 7.  Second game was downright boring.  We breezed through the first half of the game with little tension, then in the second half four out of five players spent most of their time in the Brig.  If you don't know the game, being in the Brig essentially stops time in the game (no Crises card is drawn).  With only one jump needed to win, a series of Crises cards activating the Cylon fleet destroys about five civilian ships and loses the game for the humans.  Most players felt they had spent nearly three hours having no effect on the game.  Second game rating: 2.  So I think I have seen the best and worst this game has to offer.  Much like in Knizia's Lord of the Rings encounter tiles,  if the Crises cards are stacked against you, you will lose.  If the bad Crises cards are spread out, you may have a chance.  Is it worth risking 2.5 hours of game time in what might feel like a futile exercise?  Maybe.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Like Shadows Over Camelot in a Sci-Fi setting.  Game is very tense.  Theme adds something, but isn't necessary for enjoyment (unless you include the expansions).

Biggest complaints are length and difficulty... it seems that if you have one newbie on the human side (playing Admiral or President), the humans are doomed to lose.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A very interesting co-op game with a traitor element done right.  I would rate this higher but the game really drags with 5 or 6 players.  Our last 6p game went 4 hours and that's just 1.5 hours too many.  This game can be brilliant but you really have to have the right group dynamic for it to work.


*edit*  With a few more games under our collective belts, the playtime has dropped to 3 hours or less.  This has done a lot to increase our enjoyment of the game.  Certain aspects of the game are brilliant (rooting out the Cylons for instance) but a weak Cylon player can make the game too easy for the Humans.  A really good co-op that we'll play happily on occation but it dosen't overthrow Arkham Horror and it's very dependant on having the right group.  In other words, I wouldn't play this with strangers.  For now I'm keeping my 6.5 rating.

*1/30/14* Best with 5.  Still not too keen to play with strangers tho.

I've downgraded this a touch. It feels too long for what it is, with the chrome adding a layer of fun but also complexity and difficulty in learning. If the crisis cards don't line up right, it can be a fairly boring round. It needs an expansion, but I don't want to buy it.

Excellent game, fun for human or cylon. I agree with other posters that it's more of a team game than a cooperative game; that's not a criticism, just an observation for folks who think they're getting a themed version of Pandemic or something. The biggest downside is the long playing time: 2-3 hours. It's a fun 2-3 hours for the participants, but makes coordinating game days difficult.

Recently, I've been playing shorter games like The Resistance to scratch the team/treachery itch. The theme on this is very good, though, so I've kept it around.

Update: I liked this one quite a bit, but it didn't get much table time in our group because it's so long. Currently looking for a game that does the traitor mechanic effectively but in less time.

Juego ambientado en la serie. Admite hasta seis jugadores. Todos los jugadores deben cooperar para sobrevivir y sobreponerse a los sucesos que van ocurriendo. Cada jugador lleva un personaje que tiene ciertas características. En su turno coge cartas según esas características y escoge una acción (según las cartas o la ubicación que escoja). Al final del turno hay que desvelar una carta de crisis que supone problemas para los humanos. Los retos se resuelven por votación oculta. Cada uno contribuye positiva o negativamente a los test de habilidad que dirimen todos los conflictos. Entre los jugadores hay algún traidor (según el número de jugadores puede  ser 1 o 2 cylon).  Los humanos ganan si consiguen llevar la nave a kobol, después de su octavo salto. Los Cylon ganan si los humanos no lo consiguen, o si la nave es destruida, alguno de los marcadores de los humanos llega a cero, o la nave es invadida.
Está entretenido. Gana si conoces la serie. Hay que leer bastante. Lo mejor del juego es la existencia oculta de un traidor, que da lugar a muchas situaciones. Es un buen juego.

Subida la nota de 7.5 a 8 tras mi segunda partida, esta vez, con bastante conocimiento de la serie (a mitad de la tercera temporada). Si eres jugón y te gustó la serie, este es un juego imprescindible.

A good hidden role game with the extra element of not totally knowing which side you're on until halfway through the game.

Humans have a difficult time winning in the beginning, usually due to over-compensating on skill checks when they don't have to.  With practice, I believe that skill checks will get closer and thus put the humans in better stead.

The Sympathizer card is fine the way it is. Leave it alone.

[Bought 2nd hand from Doomfarer:bradspel.net 2011-09-06]
Played with three players and it was a blast.
A constant foreboding about that something bad is going to happen.
Really like the feeling that you coplayers are all cylon.
The accusations, suspicion and threats make you always to be on your edge. Because you don't know what crazy things your human players will do to you on their way to find the cylon player.
Paranoia level is often going through the roof.

--- update ---
Played a game with 4 players and the game gets even better with more players. The cards you have on hand are fever and it's always a tough decision if you should support on a crisis card or use the cards on other important tasks.
Can see that the game will really shine with 6 players.

This is one I wish I could get to the table more often for sure! My core group of friends and I are all huge BSG fans, but some of the people we game with have never seen the show or dont care to and as such are thrown off by the theme. The game provides a great sense of paranoia as you're trying to figure out who you can trust and who you can't, and it all works together very well. Space combat is a lot of fun, and the political aspect of the game provides some unique choices. Would highly recommend to any BSG or sci-fi fan!

Game definitely slowed down right near the end as the humans just couldn't draw crisis cards that moved the jump track forward, but fortunately we managed to pull out a win with 4-2 resources on all the resource tracks.

Update:  increasing rating from 7 to 8.5 after several plays (mostly as human, but twice as Cylon).  As long as everybody doesn't try to play by committee, the game keeps moving along and is loads of fun.

07/25/2015: Originally had this at a 7.5. After playing for a second time took to a 7, and after playing tonight I've taken down to a 5. Extremely long (although given we were playing with 5 people and 3 expansions), at about 3.5 hours. Lots of downtime, and just generally not fun. Would not want to play again in the near future unless absolutely no choice.

Every time I've played this game it's told a gripping, compelling story. An online play-by-post, over several months, had tons of opportunities for betrayal, bluster, constant lies, in-character speeches... just a blast. Great components (little vipers and raiders!) and just stunning evocation of theme.

superb, tense and not a single boring second over a session of several hours.
Brought the traitor mechanism to new levels because you really can do something as traitor (you are a bit limited in Shadows over Camelot). 
There are great variants out there by SevenSpirits. We always try to play with 6 players, using [thread=399183]Valley of darkness variant[/thread]

RATING: 8
Didn't care for the series on tv at all, but game play is engaging with all players involved most of the time. If not playing skill checks on other player's turns, you are watching the current player's actions to find some clue to his loyalty. Tense game for the humans, fending off cylon ships between jumps, with resources dwindling toward the end. Each turn offers a variety of action choices, with the several ship stations, character abilities, and skill cards. This continues even toward the end of the game. The mechanic of secretly adding skill cards with the two destiny cards thrown in provides for some fun speculations. Rated for the five player game. Fun coop game, with much suspicion and accusation, but you need the right crowd.
Donated to the Dallas Gamers Marathon library. 
UPDATE: Owned again after playing recently and hoping for further plays. Great game.

Juego semicooperativo de 1 a 8 personas y unas tres horas y media de duración. 
Es actualmente el juego que más se ajusta a mis preferencias.:

 Es un juego semicoopertivo, con "infiltrado/s", lo que permite mucha interacción, mucha diplomacia, votaciones, muchas opciones sobre qué hacer y cuando...

Lamentablemente, a pesar de que a mi me gusta, tiene varias cosas en contra:
Es un juego que exige que haya un mínimo de 4 jugadores.
Es un juego que requiere disponer de 4 horas (por si acaso).
No ha calado en mi grupo habitual de jugadores.

Like many games I rate a 10, it has its flaws. But this game lives its them, creates tension like few games do, and creates a story while you play very much like the reboot TV show. This is a franchise board game done right. It won't get played often, but I love this game. Negatives: plays way too long, gamers that get frustrated easily will get frustrated with this, easy for bad blood to form between players.

RATING: 7
A fine game of paranoia and pathos. Like most co-operative games, it can suffer from "everyone-doing-what-the-most-charismatic-and-assertive-person-tells-them-to-do" ... except that, in this case, what that person is telling them to do might not actually be in their best interests, because that person could be a murderous Cylon infiltrator.

As far as cooperative games go, Battlestar Galactica is probably the best I have played. The problem is I don't like cooperative games, and BSG is a pretty long one. In three hours, the number of significant decisions is very small, and even smaller if you issue executive orders so that other players play in your turn. I might be willing to play it from time to time, but BSG is definitely not my type of game.

RATING: 7
Such a great "experience" type of game. Takes me back to the best parts of watching the show. Truly for the fans of battlestar alone, if you are playing with friends who havent seen it then try dead of winter. I feel that amongst the games like this that are all very similar, dead of winter is the best game, but I won't deny that this game resonates really well with some (heck, me included) and I still really enjoy it.

RATING: 6
Not bad for a semi-cooperative game with hidden identity deduction. Based on one game. It was a tad long for what it is. 1.5 hours would be okay. Not double that. In my one game, the president and the admiral and the sympathizer were cylons from the beginning and it was just too powerful for the humans to have a reasonable chance. It just became a long drawn out defeat.

Second game still dragged. Six player game again that lasted 3.5 hours. Double the ideal playing time for this type of game. I do like the paranoia that the game creates. Also like that for a co-operative, players make independent choices without one person telling everyone else what to do.

Update: the game has been made redundant by The Resistance.

RATING: 8
Interesting game although I probably missed a bit since I haven't watched the TV series. The fact that there might be more than one bad guy in the game in interesting and makes game unpredictable.

RATING: 7
I enjoy this game in small doses.  I think the thing I find most annoying is the long amounts of downtime between crises that matter.  The witch hunt for the cylons is the best part, and the card play around crises is clever, but once cylons are revealed, the game really isn't very much fun, and seems to be a matter of crossing fingers hoping the right crisis cards come up.

RATING: 9.3
Rating only applies in conjunction with the Valley of Darkness variant here on the Geek.

With the variant: An excellent attempt to cpature the feel of the show. There is a real tension in trying to uncover the hidden cylons and it's great to play either as a human or a cylon. Unlike other games with traitor mechanisms (Shadows over Camelot, we're looking at you) in BSG the cylons can actually do real perceptible harm without being discovered.

Without the variant: Another flawed implementation of a great idea from FFG. The game contains degenreate strategies for the humans, the sympathiser creates an ugly metagame for the humans and some of the characters are either too good or too bad.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The theme and feel is just like the TV series, and the 'semi-co-op' nature leads to lots of suspicion and 'You're a frakking toaster!' incidents. Paranoia abounds. It's hard for the humans to win (by design).

Played it a time and was led by the nose through the game and so put off that I won't do it again. I like that the cards have multiple power in five suits (so it might be a 2 red and 2 yellow), and also a main power, but there was lots going on and it felt like not having watched the television series put me at a disadvantage. Aerobic with care.

I can't really tell why but I like Dead of Winter more...

So, after my second game in which I was a Zylon after the second loyalty card I guess I can describe better what kills the game for me (in the first we used the Pegasus and in the second the Pegasus and the Exodus expansion)

The first negative is the downtime. You can't do much on you turn, just one action and then the waiting begins. Yes, you are involved in the crisis cards but that isn't enough, for me this is still downtime.
The second point is that the game becomes a pretty dull mixture of mechanics if you aren't familiar with the TV-series.
And the last complaint is about being a Zylon. Once you reveal yourself you are limited to just a few actions and aren't allowed to use card effects. Yes you have your super-special-crisis-cards but they aren't as bad as you expect them to be. So you spend a turn to draw one and a second turn to play it. But that is everything you have done in these two rounds. You don't draw crisis cards while you are revealed so combined with all of the other penalties you have to suffer there is no real reason to reveal yourself. So you just stay hidden and hope that you don't get blown out in the Airlock.

And that in a 4 hour game.
Sorry but that is just boring. I could have played a 4-player game of Twilight Imperium 3 in the same time the 4-player game of BSG took.

Dead of Winter does the traitor/exiled thing much better.
Now after my second game of BSG I have not a single reason to play that game again.

Love this game.   Of course, I'm a BSG fan, but the game itself is fantastic.  Love the paranoia and interesting strategies that can be made.   As much a game of politicing and twisting other players minds as it is anything else.  Few games can invoke the player interaction, frustration, scheming, lynching and accusing that this one can.   

I suspect the thing with this game though is it all depends on your group and the personalities involved.  It would likely not work well with a bunch of quiet/reserved people or a bunch of people who are afraid or unable to lie and misdirect.  Our group seems to be filled with enough liers and backstabbers to work perfectly with this game.

One of my favorite games.

Edit Jan 2011:  After a couple of so-so games, enthusiasm is dropping a bit.   Down to an 8.

I first played this game with zero knowledge of the BSG universe, and I was impressed.  Having begun to watch some of the series, I'm dumbstruck.  A marriage of plot, character, and game mechanics that perfect should not be possible.  And they not only did it, but created a game with balance, tension, and immersion that is outstanding.  I expect this rating to rise with more play.

As a fan of the TV series I was skeptical of this game. How could it be anything but a hopeless cash-in like some many TV/Film-2-boardgames before it? Boy was I wrong. This is an excellent co-op/traitor game in the spirit of Resistance and others. You struggle to trust your shipmates and guide the fleet through Cylon attack and worse, all the time seeking the unearth the traitors among you before they doom you all. If you're fan of the series there is lots of flavour here to enjoy but the game never puts fan-service ahead of mechanics and solid playability. I defy anyone to not like this game (unless you're a frakkin toaster that is....).

The first time I played [b]Battlestar Galactica[/b], I was human.  However, my fellow humans acted like Cylons and basically sabotaged the game.  (They said that they were just trying to confuse everyone as to their true identity.  Mission accomplished.  Everyone thought you were Cylons.)  The second time I played this game I was a Cylon.  But it became painfully obvious who was the other Cylon because he kept looking at his loyalty card to read his special ability.  Both games were not very fun for me. 

BG is innovative with its traitor game mechanic, but it can take several games before a new player can properly play their roles.  This game is best played with experienced players.

Very fun, very cleverly designed game. We had a rough time with it the first time around because one of the Cylon players gave themselves away before their first turn, but we still had a good time. I think five players is ideal, because with four, a full half of the players end up as Cylons and the game slows to an agonizing crawl as the humans inevitably fail every skill check and the Cylons are unable to summon a base ship on their turns. I'd like to try one of the expansions to see if they fix some of these problems (by adding more possibilities for ship combat, for example).

This is a -long- game, but a fun one. There were a couple of folks in the game group who looked like they weren't getting into it very much, but maybe that was just due to unfamiliarity with the game and its strategy.

This is a well-designed game, it looks gorgeous and it offers an involved and theme-appropriate experience to its players.  

That said, I just don't like it - or, it seems, any co-op games.  Part of my experience playing this game was a sequence of bad luck (cylon in round two of loyalty cards, revealed Immediately by a card draw, yippee -- an hour+ as a revealed cylon where every decision is obvious), but even without this, I still am sure I wouldn't like the game.  One of my issues is that, as a revealed cylon, the decisions are too obvious and there is little to do.

Played with a really good group, and we played with 5, which I'm told is the right number of players.  I just didn't like it.

Love co-op play in PC and video games, don't like it in boardgames.

Played it twice. First time just the base game, second time with one of the expansions. Went down from an already low score of 3 to 2 because I was giving it a second try but it was worst than the first time: Boring to death, too long, meaningless thematic to me. I suppose the fun comes from pointing out at people screaming "you are a cylon!" but, other than that there's nothing. As of 2014 BSG is definitely ranking high in my top ten list of worst games I've played.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I've had to drop my rating a point on this one, just because it's so !@$#ing long. The 5-hour play time is a complete back-breaker, given the limited range of the game itself.  5 hours for Titan, OK, 5 hours for the very repetitive and uneven BSG, not so much. There is a fair amount of good stuff in here, but it is absolutely killed by the time required to play it. Mike Siggins called it criminally overlong, and that might be an understatement.
---
Played this once and actually rather enjoyed it. But it is a bit of an overchromed monstrosity, not helped by the fact that a few critical references (mostly having to do with die rolls) that should have been on the board are not and have to be looked up, and also by the fact that too much import detail is in tiny type on the board that you have to get up next to and squint at. They had plenty of space to work with, the tiny type and missed references on the board really are almost unforgivable in a game of this complexity.

Underneath the overchromed monstrosity though are a number of good ideas trying to get out. The jumps are a great way to manage tension and ensure the semi-regular restart so the players don't get into a death spiral. The hidden loyalties are well-executed for the most part and also add a lot of good tension. The game is faithful to the good parts of the show, which is good, because I don't think you want to be faithful to all of that show, which has its own set of issues.

Where BSG struggles, though, is with pacing. The game is just too long and gets repetitive before the end, has too many moving parts, and is too much at the mercy of the draw deck for its tension. Some jumps will be great as Cylon raiders pile into the Galactica in waves. Some not so much, as you spend half an hour dealing with relatively uninteresting crises while waiting to jump (the crises themselves aren't that interesting; things only really get fun when you have bad guys swarming too). In general, there are just too many moving parts which are not tight enough. The players manage many more resources than they do in Lord of the Rings, and yet somehow end up with many fewer tough and interesting choices. I can't help but think this game could be much improved if it were the euro that in its heart of heart it really is, and wasn't trying to be the overwrought super-themey sort of thing FFG specializes in (which always delivers a boatload of rules but doesn't always deliver plausible theme). Usually more is less, and this applies to theme as much as anything else.  Here as much as anywhere, a tighter, tenser game would be thematically far stronger than this kind of kitchen sink game.

Final thought: it's been said that a revealed Cylon may be too strong - with not really enough incentive to remain hidden - and I can see the strength of that argument. I'm not sure it's entirely convincing, but it's definitely a worry, since the position of a revealed Cylon is also not a terribly interesting one to actually play.
---
Oh yeah, and one other thing, one of the reason that the show ultimately turned me off was its one-note tone: dark. It had no emotional range and just got boring. Real people are sometimes funny and crack jokes when they're under stress. BSG characters always take themselves so excruciatingly, painfully seriously. I mention this only because playing BSG the boardgame was a rich mine of humor, and if only the show had been able to capture some of the humor we found in the game, maybe it wouldn't suck.
---
Looking forward to playing this quite a bit actually, but I'm worried about two things: first, balance, at which FFG is notoriously inept but which is important to this sort of game. Second, it's got the same phoney and unworkable player communication rules that Shadows over Camelot had. It seems a little less egregious here, but it's still a little unfortunate - if you can't make a straightforward rule, it's not a good sign.

The game itself does not break 3 legs to a duck, but what is great is the interaction between players, suspicion etc...
Hard to play because it requires 5 players and between 2 and 3 hours.
Replaced by Resistance?
It does have an "epic" feel though...
Should I try expansions?

Very cool traitor game. I really enjoyed the two rounds of identity assignment in that someone who is a human during the first of the game can become a cylon in the second half. Definitely an interesting dynamic compared to other traitor games where the traitor is usually set from the beginning. I also really enjoyed the fact that each character not only has a special ability but also a one-time super ability and a flaw that causes each player to be worse at something than others. It helped make each character much more unique. Looking forward to playing more of BSG even though I've never watched the show.

RATING: 7.2
THE hidden role/traitor game.  It's slightly complex, can take a long time, can become bloated at times with expansion - but it's fun as hell.  Nothing quite delivers like BSG and it has to be one of the closest tie-ins to theme that I've seen.  If you're a fan of the show you will fall in love with the game, and even if you're not you will still have a blast due to the addictive and immersive gameplay.  

A real gem that will stand the test of time despite its flaws.

RATING: 8
The game handles the dual tensions of human/unrevealed cylons and human/cylon victory very well. They are two tensions that operate side by side for most of the game, and the relation between the two is what drives the game.

The game's biggest flaws are that you need exactly five players and that it is really really long. Oh yeah, and the rulebook is the usual FFG mess.

One of my all time favorite games.  There are tons of configurations with number of players, and various expansion pieces.

Allowing players to use bits and pieces of the expansions is huge and keeps things interesting.

I love the way the game is always presenting opportunities for Cylons to sabotage covertly, or to cast doubt and suspicion on the humans.

I am always up for a game of this!

Omg, the very first "traitor" game I ever played, and what an experience.. Tabletalk is highly encouraged which greatly enhances the gaming experience. It is not a problem if you did not watch any of the TV series but it does come in handy if you already know some of the background and game fluff. The game can tend to be a bit on the long side (about 4 hour game for a  player game) but much worth it.

Great game and must have in any boardgame collection.

I suppose this game is a testament to me having great friends not just great games.

It's a beyond-excellent interpretation of a wonderful TV show AND has a mix of serious strategy and traitor mechanic. With the right people, there is a great atmosphere of paranoia and mutual suspicion.

RATING: 5.5
To tell you the truth, my first game of Battlestar Galactica should probably get a lower rating than 6 simply because I had never tried it before and I played against some hardcore pros who had played it tons of times before and knew all of the cards and good moves etc.! It certainly didn't help that I was the only cylon and perhaps I didn’t make the best choices throughout the game as I didn’t fully grasp the best strategy as a cylon on my own... My enthusiasam about the game was hampered even more as I was thrown in the brig before my second turn (though I have to say that I had some extreme bad luck, as I would only be accused if two red cards turned up from the destiny deck which was statistically highly unlikely – guess what happened... Oh, and it didn’t help much that I was the second cylon as well after the sleeping phase.

Despite all of this I found the game to be okay, and it definitely has the potential for a higher rating. I am sure, though, that I am never going to be a huge fan of this game and rate it 9-10 – it goes on way too long! We were 6 players (2 newcomers) and it took 4½ hours which is too much! 2 hour would be perfect.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Good quality components and interesting theme. Creates more paranoia than Shadows over Camelot because of the greater chance of players being (or becoming) a Cylon. Usually well balanced though the Cylons have won about 9 out of 10 games so far. Best of the co-ops that I've played (I don't really enjoy this genre) though it has length and downtime issues. Skill checks can become rather repetitive. 

I'm not sure if the theme is enough to make me like this game. I watched the first box set of BSG and was rather underwhelmed. I mean, is that the best bunch of rookie pilots they can dig up? They are a bunch of American school drop-outs with severe attitude problems, unable to follow the simplest orders! And, who shall we use for the President's bodyguard? Why, our completely untrained (in bodyguard duties) and non-expendable Viper pilots, of course! At least Baltar made it watchable.

RATING: 6.5
BSG does a pretty decent job at emulating the paranoia and suspicion that went with the first two seasons of the show.  If you were a fan of the gritty, post-apocalyptic, survivalist, military sci-fi of seasons 1 and 2 (and Razer) then you'll probably enjoy this game.

Players take on the roll of characters from the show working together to save humanity -- or so they think.  Some of the players may secretly be Cylons, and be actively working to sabotage humanity.

The game rewards careful thought and the ability to read people.  It's also an excuse to call your friends and family "Fraking Toasters!"

Gameplay feels very stacked against the humans; in all the games I've played the humans have only won once.

For non-fans of the show the game might feel slightly less approachable.  As the years go on and people forget the details of the show it may become easier to introduce new people to it.

Battlestar Galactica is THE game for the hidden traitor mechanic.  I was a huge fan of Shadows Over Camelot, but BSG has supplanted it.  It is a bit complicated (I'd say it takes 15 minutes to learn), but overall, a great game.

There is no better moment in board gaming than flipping over that traitor card... it makes the entire game far more fun.

I played the game before I watched the TV show.  Now that I've seen the show, this is a near-perfect rendition.

RATING: 9
Rating after only a single play, so it may well change with repeated plays, but it left me laughing and feeling so good to have played it. 

It seemed to fulfill the expectations of those who knew the show, but one player who had never watched it also seemed to have just as much fun.

Part of the delight was that our first game came down to the wire, in that the Galactica survived despite being reduced to a population of 1 (actually we ended on population 2, due to an opportune gain at the last turn.

Thoroughly enjoyable, and I expect it to take quite a while to get tired of it.

RATING: 8.5
Love this game! I was a big fan of the series and it is remarkable how events in the game play out like certain events in the show. That is - alert vipers are essential to protecting citizens - characters can be thrown into the brig - new elections can determine the President, etc.

I also like how the Admiral and President are given special role powers, and how these powers can be usurped by other players.

The fact that some players thinking they are human - but later finding out they are cylon - is also a very awesome attribute of this game.

The only bad thing I can say about it is that it requires a lot of explanation to new players. Also, some players may be turned off by the long playing time.

Find a group that loves these types of games and can handle the time commitment and you will have a great time!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
There is some good fun here - being a cylon and revealing at the right time provides great tension.  The secretive way cards are utilized with the destiny deck is nicely done and allows some 'screwage' without players being implicated as cylons.  The crisis deck can be very unforgiving, but the game's fun factor much overshadows the game play RNG since even losing is a good time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A really great coop with traitor, the nature of the conflict between players can be very abrasive. People may randomly accuse others of being cylons, or have their warnings go unheeded.  Good fun, a real challenge for the human players, but I'd still rather play this than Shadows Over Camelot.

RATING: 6
This is a difficult game to rate, as it has a number of clear strengths and a few key drawbacks.

Strengths--man, I love the theme. If I had to choose strong mechanics vs. strong theme, I'd choose the former. But BSG has theme in spades. I love games with hidden roles, and the fact that cylon role cards are introduced midway through the game keeps the tension high (which, is a clear strength over Shadows over Camelot). Although there are a number of moving parts, all of it makes sense.

Cons--the playing time. If I plan on spending 3 hours on a game, it has to be something special. BSG is on the cusp... but I need another play before I can say definitively that it delivers for the whole duration. Turn order is ssllllloooowwww. I think I waited 15 minutes between turns at one point. Yes, it depends on the players. But a game that encourages tabletalk like this does not play quickly. Fortunately, the skills checks help to keep everyone involved.

I played this with the Pegasus and another expansion, and I'd like to try this again with the base game only. That might help to keep things a bit more lean. As a gamer that tends to gravitate toward Euros more than heavy Ameritrash, I'm not an audience for the expansions. But the base game has a lot of intriguing elements in it.

Update: a 2nd game with only the base game, and my original comments still seem pretty accurate. Thematically rich, mechanically slick, and probably one hour too long. However, I've probably played it with six players both times, and I'd be curious trying it again with five or four.

I only played this once, but I enjoyed it.  Knowledge of the TV series is not required to play the game, though I'm sure it probably helps with the enjoyment.  This is a semi-cooperative style game, where all players are seemingly on the same side, but some are secretly working against the group.

This game has dropped in the past two years.  It is too long for what it is, a bit too tricky to play, and definitely too rules intensive for casual family gatherings.  It's a bit like the series that way.  When it was great it was great, and then it dropped like a stone.

-------

For fans of the show this game can be fantastic fun.  The trash talk, the accusations, the intrigue of trying to figure out who is a cylon.

In most of my games, I've been a sleeper cylon, and I suspect that's the most interesting role.  You learn you're one of the bad guys half way through the game, now how are you going to betray the others without being found out?

I would only caution that the game can be long, 3 -4 hours is not uncommon, and the cylons tend to win ... I'm not sure why this is the case and if it's a trend.  Seems more of an issue with 6.  In addition, the role of Sympathizer is unsatisfying for most who get it, consider either (a) reaching Kobol with some resource in the red (so the Sympathizer is just another human) or (b) playing with the official FFG variant in which the sympathizer is removed.

I have rarely had as much fun playing a board game as when I played BSG.  My friends, including some non-gamers,loved it too.  The theme really gets people who are fans of the show involved.

Highly recommended.

Love it!  I've had some really tense games so far, and it isn't quite as transparent who the cylons are as it is to find the bad guy in Shadows Over Camelot.  The rules really aren't that bad, either, at least for an FFG game.  I've heard some horror stories from friends that have been thrown in the brig (not as a cylon) where they've rotted for hours on end.  That would be horrible, but I can't see that as optimal play.  So, until that sort of thing becomes a problem, I really enjoy this game.

1 play (6p, 4+ hrs)--seems quite good except for the time factor, which is too bad; in addition to it taking a long time to play, there's sometimes a very long time to wait for your turn.  But on the other hand, there is sporadic interaction going on during that time, and I felt interested in what was going on.  While it's true fewer players would mean less time, I like how the factions work with that many players. Our game was very close, another plus. So I'm not sure what to think but it's worth another try.

Luckily I haven't played this so many times that I have "grokked" it and still take much enjoyment in not realising what all the cards and abilities can do.

The traitor mechanism is brilliant. But one downside to it: everyone wants to be a cylon! This means that if you are NOT a cylon, it's a tiny bit of a let down when you flip the cards over - strange eh?

But this is a fun game that I have had many many a jolly arument about. This is one of the games that I have played that has the MOST amount of post-game analysis. That is a good thing. It is fun :)

Another good point; it mimics the TV program SO accurately. I love that the feeling of depression and hopelessness that the cast experience in the series is exactly the same how you experience it in the boardgame.

A bad point: I do not like feeling depressed and hopeless! 

I like how each character has a very specific role that they excel in and that the team can come together fantastically (only to be torn apart internally).

Would rate an 8 but must rate it a 7 due to the amount of numbing despair.

Wow, what a highly thematic game!  Some of the downtime (when the space was clear) was a little long and drawing skill cards each turn was a bit of a pain, But even the downtime felt thematic as you waited with baited breath for the next Cylon attack.  Although the first game out was a 2-player test run, accusations flew after the Sleeper Agent phase and it was pretty intense.

Best game of 2008 hands down. All my buddies in my game group love it, which makes for awesome, very tense games.

Humans win-loss ratio: 11-6

I've finally been the Cylon on my tenth game. Twice in the same game too! What a tense game it was. The humans barely pulled a victory with 3 dials at 1 and 5 population left, and plenty of civilian ships poised to be destroyed by raiders within a couple more turns.

The game does not feel like it drags once you start playing it's very engaging.

As with Arkham Horror this is mainly remaining in my collection as a reminder of great times with lifelong friends.

Unfortunately I have been absolutely unable to sell people on the gameplay experience given the desperately different playstyles being a human or betrayer forces you into.

It's grand, but only after a few plays with individuals who can remember a pile of rules & strategies.

As I look back on the game, it was too thematic and too heavy with people who don't know of the show. The length also kills it for most people. I have fond memories but memories doesn't override length, too thematic to be able to teach to new players (especially those who don't know what a sympathizer card is) and heaviness. If I want a sci-fi show game that is about social deduction and hidden roles I would play Orphan Black The Card Game all day every day over this. Will not play this or any semi-coop as almost every other semi-coop is basically this with a different theme or dumber rules (see Dead of Winter)

RATING: 8
The television show has become painful to watch.  It had so much promise...and the miniseries was really captivating, then it all went to hell. It turned into this soap opera where the characters were written different every episode and all this false drama.

The good news is that it all spawned this great hunt-the-traitor(s) game!

I've only played once so far, but it was thematic, tense, humorous and fun. The cylons won narrowly.  We had 6 players and lots of close calls. There was a lot of movie/TV quoting going on.  One guy talked like Colonel Tye the whole time. That alone is worth a full ratings point.

I thought the game worked pretty well, and can't really think of any specific criticisms. I think maybe it kind of wore out its welcome at the end, but not too much, and we had several new players so that is probably more the group.

I'm not sure it will hold its charm for me with too many repeat playings, but I'd like to play again a few more times.

This is tremendous fun with a good group that's into the game.  Paranoia, accusations, suspicion, tension and hilarity - it's a ton of fun. The traitor mechanism makes this a great game.

Without a good group, i'd think the rating would go from 9 to about 4.5 though.  The group dynamic makes this game or could really drag it down.

Why are people still playing cooperative games when they have this gem to engage in instead?!  I was mostly a fan of the show, but only loosely, watching the first season, a portion of the second, and the last... but knowing the show only makes the game a little better.  The shining feature here is the hidden teams.  There need to be more games with hidden, asymmetric teams.  Mechanically, the rest of it is very straight mechanical chrome designed to evoke the subject matter... great for the fan, but shallow perhaps for the non-fan of the show.

RATING: 7.5
I like this game a lot, but everyone else I know refuses to play it now.

The problem is the huge amount of rules that no one can remember (even the person who owns the game), which turns the game into a grueling 5 hour match between, ultimately, the wrong amount of cylons vs human players. It is pretty frustrating, and has happened 3/3 times I have played this game.

However, I think the play is pretty fun otherwise, and I like the intrigue (until I find the game was set up incorrectly and the match was unbalanced). But I can not stand for a game that lasts 5 hours, that is too much for me. However, where everyone else refuses to touch the game again, for me, hope springs eternal that I will one day play a smoothly run, correctly set-up game of BSG.

7.5/10 for "good lord, that took all day and we didn't even play it right"

Board text too small for me to read with my eyesight so I felt it was hard for me to play. Some amount of tension but it just didn't grab me.

RATING: 4
A stunning disappointment after all the positive reviews. The gameplay is highly repetitive with the core mechanism being relentless card-play 'skill checks' conducted for very little actaul game effect beyond decreasing abstract dials representing key resources. After four hours of play I knew something wasn't right when I was actually hoping the cylon player would blow up Galactica to avoid enduring yet another jump sequence... 

I really wanted to LOVE this game. The production values are great and any fans of the TV show (like me) will appreciate the way the game evokes the series. The 'hidden' traitor mechanic is also a really exciting game idea and clearly has worked well for many other players. But in my experience with the game its impact can vary wildly depending on when this happens and how adept the player is at disguising their identity. 

Please note my impression is based on playing with 4 players only and know that the recommendation is for 5 - but it's difficult to see how more players can address the core emptiness of the game.

I kind of like this game but:
* The best player seldom wins, the game is very random.
* The rulebook is the worst I've ever seen, it's impossible to look up specific rules.
* In games with more players it is possible you get a character without many meaningful decisions.

"Average game, slightly boring, take it or leave it". Yeah, that sounds about right. I don't really care for the theme, but I don't hate it or anything. The mechanics are by no means bad, but they're not exciting either. There is some downtime, but nothing too extreme. Alignments are always fun, but not if you change throughout the game. It's a big box of "average" for me.

My game group LOVES this game... like played it 60-70 times before I got there.  It's fun, but I kinda feel like the game plays a bit on rails.  There is almost always the RIGHT thing to do and then the CYLON thing to do.  Being a cylon definitely adds options, but as a human the game is just figuring out who the cylon is and not about your specific choices.

I can not believe how much I love this game. The game and theme mesh extremely if not perfectly well. It also does not have the typical fiddliness that I come to expect from a lot of FFG games. I love playing a Cylon in this game!

I am not sure if I will ever bother going back to Shadows Over Camelot.

I would give the game a 10, but the Cylon base ships should be cool plastic ones! Come on FFG lets have an expansion!

One of my favorite hidden role games AS WELL AS favorite cooperative games. Just an excellent blend of both genres, super intense and really engaging no matter who's turn.

Will say, it is EXTREMELY hard for human players to win, even with no Cylons in play. This might turn certain people off if you're really just interested in winning or if your group doesn't like to lose two or three times in a row, but it is very possible to win.

 BattleStar Galactica was nominated for our game of the year for countless reasons. It's incredibly fun to play, easy to learn, and there is nothing more satisfying than throwing your friends in the brig. This board game does more than bring the TV series to life, it puts the players into an intense situation of survival, struggles, teamwork, sabotage, subterfuge, and betrayal. This game is at it's best when the Cylon players are still a mystery and the frustration comes when accusations land on innocent humans. Often an innocent human can feel cornered when they realize they've said something that could condemn themselves.

11/11/12 - Really enjoyed this one - particularly with the theme (I love the TV series). 

We only just won as the humans and that was after the game was 'rebalanced' in favour of the humans. I have read and heard that the game is unbalanced towards the cylon players. I would like to play again using the standard rules to test this further. We won as humans but it was close (and if we were playing the default starting conditions we would have lost). It didn't help our cause that I let the cylon out of the brig, and I think our victory would have been more comfortable if I had left him there (or alternatively executed him). 

16/2/2013 - Played this as a 5 player and I was a cylon. The humans only just won in a marathon (almost 5 hour) game. My mistake in retrospect was revealing as a cylon too early, even though it was relatively late in the game. I should have used the move to accuse someone else. I could have tried to sow some doubt, rather than reveal as my once off cylon power was quite weak given chief tyrol was in play. Was a great game that came down to the wire. 

24/8/2013 - Played a 5 player again, and was a human (cylons won). Played this with two eurogamers who didn't really get into it. This game is better with others who enjoy this genre. 

This game is somewhat long and for this reason it doesn't rate higher than 8.5.

RATING: 7
I find most pure coops a bit too dry and analytical. The paranoia and suspicion in the Battlestar Calactica (a semi co-op) is refreshing. Unfortunately, the game can be quite boring for some players whose characters are not taking important decisions and especially when the character is locked up in the brig. Like all such games it needs a right group. The game seems to favor the cylon team.

My wife and I became fans of the show. This game reflects what was great about the show--not knowing who the Cylons are and the paranoia and accusations that occur as a result. Even if you haven't watched it, still a fun game. The only drawback is the length--our games have usually lasted 5 hours. I only play it with 5-6 players. With 3 players, it's a bit flat.

First play was all wrong rule wise, deck was not shuffled so no cyclons ever attacked. 2nd play was with four, I was exposed first round as a cylon, and a sympathizer was immediately thrown into the brig and remained there all game. I think that this game hinges on having 5-6 players and needs the right group to get into the theme.

8 is a placeholder based on the potential I see in this game's mechanics and traitor intrigue. Based on first two plays it is more like a 3 but I think it has tons of potential. Can't wait to try again.

Egy év alatt csak egyszer került elő, akkor is 4-en voltunk rá, szóval nem épp a legjobb mechanika állt elő, de így is nagyon élveztük a játékot. Egy hajszálon múlt, hogy az emberek nyertek. Nagyon át tudja hozni a sorozat tematikáját: az első ugrásig a nyakunkban volt a cylon flotta, mindenki tette a dolgát, ment a kooperáció, adrenalin hegyekben. Azután sikerült ugrani, teljes lett a béke és nyugalom: erre egyből beindult egy nagyon komoly politikai adok-kapok... Elő kell venni gyakrabban.

Egy játék után nem akarok végleges következtetést levonni. A film hangulatát maximálisan visszaadja, de a játék felétől (amikor egy játékosból cylon lesz) esélytelennek éreztem az embereket...

Feb. 10, 2009 -- After two plays of this, I think the game has a few flaws, but with the right people it can be a lot of fun. The people actually seem to make the game, whereas the game itself sometimes just doesn't feel like it has enough options on certain turns.

It would be nice if there was some way to move the jump point along. Sometimes turns taken feel like they're wasted because there's nothing really to do that can help the humans win the game. On the other hand, though, the Cylons are a lot of fun to play once they're out in the open. 6/10

Very interesting. The first few turns I thought "So what's all the buzz about" but then the cylon factor came in. Everybody thought everyone else was a cylon (no one was till after jump 4 actually...) causing mayhem on board. And that was with only 3 players! Simple and fun game.

Still my favourite hidden-role game.  Much improved with extra modules from the expansions (especially Pegasus ship board, and the Cylon Fleet modules, as well as treachery cards).

Would recommend playing with 5/6 players, Usually remove the Sympathiser card before the start of play.

Wanted to like it very much, but it just did not seem to hit it off with our group.  Maybe it had something to do with teaching the game to 4 people at 10:45 for the last game of the night.  Still we finished at 12:45.  Also it was our second game of the night after playing Shadows over Camelot.  Maybe our group is just a little tired of co-op/traitor games.

I'm giving this an initial rating of 8 after my first (5-player) learning game. Lots of fun, lots of choices... and although we'd only barely sensed the strategies possible in the game, everyone had a great time. There was much discussion after the game and everyone is looking forward to the next play. It's interesting to note that of the group of five, only one player had ever seen the show (not a fan, but had seen several episodes). I don't think that fact hindered our enjoyment in the least. Your mileage may vary, but Battlestar Galactica seems a perfect fit for my game group.

Update: Simply HAD to bump up my initial rating. At present, it's almost a foregone conclusion that this will hit the table over almost anything else in my collection. It's a great game with a deeply immersive theme... it accommodates varied play styles/personalities... and it never fails to engage all of us in not only a compelling narrative, but - most importantly -  a raucously entertaining couple of hours of sheer fun!

Battelstar is one of my favorite space operas and playing this game is a lot of fun.  The game play mechanics are perfect so that the experience drips with the theme from the show.  

Getting it to the table is a bit of a challenge though.  It has a long play time and requires a bunch of friends to want to play it too.  For this reason, I traded my copy away, but I'd gladly play this anytime with others who want to play it.

RATING: 7
This game is pretty good with four players but much better with more. The sympathizer card strikes me as a necessary but somewhat forced mechanic. Once players start getting close to the halfway point (where the sympathizer card will be dealt out) they start considering whether they want to intentionally lose enough resources to get into the red in order to avoid there being two Cylon players (instead of one). That detracts from the mood a little in my opinion, but unfortunately it's a rational consideration.

I think the theme works fabulously for a co-op, however, and I enjoy it in spite of any "metagaming" flaws.

I haven't watched the TV series (as a declaration before the rest of this). 

BSG is a wonderful idea for a game, with a possible traitor mechanic and a mechanic to leave you wondering if there is a traitor among you. My biggest gripe is that it takes far too long. 

It's good if you have about 3+ hours to set aside, or if you agree to playing to a shorter distance to speed it up a little. I generally play that the humans have to reach a distance greater than 8, without having to make an extra jump.

Frakkin' toasters! The gameplay fits perfectly with the BSG setting and is evocative of the show's key premise.  It can overstay its welcome and be difficult to teach.  The game initially seems way more complicated than it is by a fairly obtuse rule book.  It's fun to be the traitors secretly bringing down the ship from the inside and also rewarding to make it through as the meatbags trying to deduce who the toasters are. Very neat is the dealing of loyalty cards a second time midway through the game- so your loyalty may switch and you end up being a toaster all along!

Epic Game, my favorite semi-coop!

Pros:
-Games tend to be tense and close until the very end
-Depth of play: interesting variety of actions available
-Diversity: due to the sheer number of crisis cards, characters and modules, every game played will be different. With expansions, the possibilities are almost endless.
-Traitor element: interesting possibilities as a traitor. The traitor can't ruin the game in just 1 blow (like in Dead of Winter), and doesn't have his hands tied (like in Shadows of Camelot). Traitors have interesting actions and possibilities. Revealing early to be all-out at opposing the players, waiting for a golden opportunity, insidiously taking control of key positions, etc.
At 5 players, there will be 2 traitors, which makes it more interesting for the traitors. It's the best traitor mechanism as of yet.

Cons:
-Difficult to teach casual gamers. The game takes a 1-3 tries before you begin the see the depth and potential.

I really enjoyed this game in the early days, with newer players. It tended to take a really long time, but I figured that would tighten up with experience.

Then I played a game or two with more experienced players, and much of the fun vanished - their knowledge  was such that even slightly sub-optimal plays were instantly noted and called out. This left the Cylons no room for subtle sabotage - only a single well-timed moment of betrayal - and turned the deduction from subtle clues into something I didn't like nearly as much. (It also acted as the co-op alpha-player problem, only with "...and if you don't do X, you must be a Cylon" as a stick.)

De los mejores juegos cooperativos con traidor. Cuando jugué por primera vez, ni conocía la serie, pero me la terminé viendo entera de lo que me gustó el juego. MUY recomedable con 5, con 6 flojea la mecánica del simpatizante; y con menos, un solo cylon no emparanoia lo mismo que 2. Si se tiene tiempo, gran juego, sobretodo por la historia que suele dejar.

RATING: 3
Components: Cool spaceships and character pawns. The board is fun, but having all the text face one direction for a multi-player game with secret roles is a big mistake, as it could be quite obvious that a player is trying just a little too hard to read the cylon actions from upside down. Very important information is either in small print (like on the character card, which need only be referenced if the player remembers to check for special powers), or hiding in the rule book (like the Cylon ships' attack behavior).

Experience: First, the game is very fiddly. I suspect a designer could cut the game in half (complexity and length) and still have a good BSG system.

Second, the game is too long for what it delivers. Every round felt pretty much like the previous rounds: attack the ships if there are any, otherwise do something else.

Third, the theme isn't working for me. The game has way more theme than most games, and does evoke many elements of the show, but I think the fiddliness really gets in the way of me feeling like we were each a unique character with a distinct personality. We could all pretty much do the same stuff. Gaius manning the guns or Starbuck becoming President just doesn't make sense, at least not without a handicap commensurate with their relative experience at the task. Also, and this is important (and I'm drawing only from the first two seasons that I've seen), I don't think the Cylon paranoia in the show reached the same levels as in the game. In the show, there are hundreds and hundreds of personnel, only eight of which could be Cylons (since Adama recognizes one of the templates from the very beginning). So the crew might not know who the other eight or so traitors are, but they can be sure that most people aren't traitors. In a three player game, half of my crew are traitors. In a six player game, a third of the crew are traitors. That's way more like Werewolf than like BSG.

Fourth, it's not very interesting. There are actually a lot of different actions a player may take on their turn, but they all felt the same and inconsequential to me. It would be much more interesting if I could string together several actions, such that doing things in a certain sequence made sense. But with only one action on my turn, I either roll dice to hit the bad guys, draw a card, play a card with fairly predictable results, etc. There are enough different types of actions, but they need to each be more interesting, and interact with each other in more interesting ways (i.e. someone who has just come from sickbay is too weak to move to a different ship; a player may fire Galactica's canons multiple times, but at an increasing cost of fuel; spend food to increase morale; move ships farther than one space, but the baddies get a free attack as the ships pass by; etc.). It's not that it was always obvious what to do, but that whatever action I took seemed slightly boring.

Fifth, the deception is not to my liking. I especially don't want to be a Cylon and have to lie for most of the game. There's just no delight in being sneaky if I can't celebrate it until much later in the game. And it's super stressful. And it's too long a game to keep up such a pretense. But even as a human, I dislike having to distrust the other players so much. Without knowing a single person who is definitely with me, I must assume everyone is against me, which is the case in most competitive games, but at least there it's all on the level. And I don't mind secret deduction games (like Mr. Jack), because they are just asymmetrical win conditions for openly declared enemies. But to have to rake my teammates through the coals before I'm satisfied they are pure enough to be trusted is like TSA treating everyone at the airport like a terrorist: we're all safer, but now nobody enjoys flying anymore.

I had heard so much about this game. After an aborted attempt at playing it a year ago, further hype made me think I just hadn't given the game long enough to develop. Now I feel just as jaded about the game as I do about the show, like it has abused me. There are many suggestions that the box's required number of players is too low, that it should only be played with 5+, but I have very little interest to discover how that adds anything other than giving each player even less control over the outcome.

Adding hidden traitors to a co-operative game is brilliant and perfectly thematic for this game! The rulebook is somewhat labyrinthine (especially when you include an expansion or two) and the rules can be difficult to learn, but, once you've figured it out, it's fantastic. It can play very long, however, especially if you're looking up rules a lot. I'd love to play it more often, but it can be hard to get it to the table due to the length.

The only thing that holds this game back from being a solid 10 is the time.  Don't get me wrong, I love the game (and don't feel it's replaced by Dead of Winter).  But damn, it's long.  The game tends to lose a little steam after the cylons have revealed but before the tight endgame.  If they could find a way to cut the play time in half with some variant then this would dethrone Mage Knight as my #1.  The Cylon fleet board from Exodus is essential.

I actually go to a Con every year just to be able to play a variant of the game where Galactica has 5 people playing at 1 table and pegasus has 5 people playing at another table across the room.  at distance 4, we jump together and have a massive Cylon fleet engage us.  its so amazing and can't thank Craig and Russ enough for hosting it.

An evening of Cylon accusations and dwindling resources.  Great fun.  However, if you approach this thinking "the humans may win this" you are sorely mistaken.  It should have the subtitle "the Cylons are going to win".  It's good fun being a Cylon to be honest - you really don't have to try too hard at deceit - literally do everything you can to help and get out of whichever crises is punishing the doomed humans.  It's teasing really - you get that "You Are A Cylon" card and it may as well be "congratulations - you've won without trying".  Regardless, I have a lot of fun playing it.  It's all about the group really.  But the Humans will lose.

Second play downgrades rating to 9 -- great game, but takes quite a while. I'm worried expansion will make it take even longer than that.

Love it.  A new purchase that has had a lot of play.  Very paranoid and great fun, whether the Cylon player reveals early or late.  Hard to win as the good guys.  Look, feel and gameplay are spot on (maybe half an hour too long though?), but you probably need to have seen the series to properly appreciate it.

I've only played this once at a convention.  I think I enjoyed it more because of the people I was playing with and not for the game itself.  I really need more plays to see if my rating is accurate, but the long play time is what tends to drive me away from trying it again.

RATING: 10
While the game is not perfect (some lulls during phases without cylon ships, some ambiguity in the rules that require lots of research to clarify), I love it because it is an interesting blend of my favourite type of game (semi-cooperative) with the greatest theme ever.

Plays like a cooperative game but instead has a secret team of traitors (Cylons) who turn on the crew and attempt to sabotage the mission.  Does what it does well.  I'm just not fond of getting traitors in my cooperative games.

RATING: 7.5
It's probably a little bloated, a little long, a little heavy on the rules overhead, a little unbalanced in favor of the Cylons, and little overly reliant on Executive Order cards. But after you've paid the price of entrance, the narrative moments that this game is capable of creating are tense and exciting and immersive in a way that few other games can compete with.

Also, BSG rules.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game is quite Ameritrashy with random Crisis draws, Skill card draws, Destination draws, and Destiny draws.  Not to mention the dice rolls for combat and the luck-of-the-draw as to who becomes a Cylon. Independently, these are okay, but when combined, these elements mean a luck component underlies much of what occurs in the game.

Nonetheless, the uncertainty behind who may become a Cylon is part of the game's appeal, both thematically and from a game-mechanic perspective (because it adds tension).  Trickery also has to be employed to help conceal your identity.  Perhaps being a Cylon is more engaging?     

The biggest problem with this game is its 180 minute length.  Does anyone want to co-op for that long?

After 1 play: I freely admit that I went into playing this game as a doubter. I do not like Shadows over Camelot and have not been impressed with the majority of the big box Fantasy Flight games. Heck, I haven't seen any episodes of the new show (saw the one in the late 1970s, just not the one from this decade). 

In spite of this, I have to say I was favorably impressed. The game gives a feeling of pressure and paranoia that really works well. 

After two plays: I may have to get a copy of this. It's blast!

It is a little long for what it is, and it can sometimes be anticlimatic.  That said, this is an immensely fun game.  I enjoy the "cooperative + traitor" genre, and this is the best of them all.  Highly recommended, even if you are not a fan of the show.

I LOVED BSG so much... waaah!

RATING: 4
Played it once as a 3P game, it was one of the worst experiences I've ever had and I wasn't the Cylon. The other non-Cylon player had outed the Cylon pretty easily, and we had a combo going that completely locked the Cylon out for the second half of the game. The least satisfying win I've ever had in board gaming. I imagine this would be much better as a 5P game, which is why I'm not rating this as low as I should be.

RATING: 10
A really big hit with my group that usually ends in a Human bloodbath.  The range of emotions experienced while playing [i]Battlestar Galactica[/i] is second to none.

Took 5hrs, 10minish. We were all learning the rules though and so 3-4 hrs seems likely for a 2nd play.

I enjoyed the game of deduction and evaluating our resources as a group was fun.

Cylons won. The ending wasn't climactic - more a victory of attrition than of any particular treachery/attack/move. 

Cylons being able to 'masquerade' as human, even when we knew without doubt who they were, seemed thematically wrong.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
One of my favorite licensed games.

Fantasy Flight nailed the theme and tension of the show, and have provided fans with one of the best "traitor" games available. The variability between sessions (different characters and roles) keeps the game very enjoyable.

There are issues though:
* Doesn't really scale well for different sized groups of players.
* Simply too long. Every game I've seen where humans win or come close has run longer than it really should. By the end, some people may lose interest.
* Relies on having active, involved players. When you've got one or more people who "check out" and stop caring about what happens, it really hurts the gameplay.

Because of those problems, this is a game where you have to pick and choose when it comes out. Still a winner though.

Expansions are interesting. Some parts add to the game nicely, other parts feel tacked on or slightly boring. Being able to pick and choose how much of an expansion will be used is a nice addition, although I'm not sure they are worth the price of admission.

===

Edit: Rating dropped because it's just too hard to get on a table. This remains a very good game *if you have a group interested in taking the time to play*.

One of the few board games that consistently manages to create suspense with every new play.  It can be hard for new players to take on the role of the cylons, but with the right group, this game really shines.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
If you have a good group of people to play this game with, it can be one of the best experiences a table-top game has to offer.  You KNOW someone is going to be a Cylon, but you don't know WHEN they will be a Cylon, or WHO is a Cylon.  

The only pitfall is that I am disappointed when I don't get to be a Cylon, because I feel like that is what makes the game EXTREMELY fun--trying to figure out how to disrupt and sow dissent without giving away your motives.

The only downfall is that this game does take a healthy chunk of time, but it is such a fun and social game that it doesn't really feel like a long game.  But for those times where you don't have an entire evening, it won't be able to make its way to the table.  But when it does, everyone is in for a good ol' backstabbing time!

Talk about super insanely long and repetitive. In fact, I'm not sure I want to spend any more time on it.

And how awkward is that whole thing of people hedging their bets and mildly screwing the team during the first half of the game just in case they become evil when the second cards are dealt out.

Most players seem to have very little to do. And most decisions don't seem like they're very hard if you're experienced with the game. And it seems like the expansions just make the game longer.

I like games with lots of theme. But what's the point of playing this instead of more evenly paced hidden role games?

Fun and thematic. Does a good job of conjuring the paranoia of the show, and we have had some very fun games with this, especially a recent one where we survived a massive cylon attack on the last turn and limped into our final destination just in time with no ability to absorb more losses. The expansions need to be cherry picked, but add a few interesting things. I especially like the Cylon fleet option in the second expansion. 

I highly recommend the combined rulebook in the files section.  

Includes Broken Token insert.

Have only played it a few times and I'm still not convinced that I'm a fan of the mechanics in this game. It plays like a needlessly convoluted/complicated version of today's typical co-op. But...that's only half the game. With the right group, the experience can be magical. One of the games played was a six hour marathon where the Cylon was both brilliant and lucky in avoiding detection.

RATING: 8
Excellent Ameritrash game that minimizes the use of dice!  Great mechanics of having all players draw more Loyalty cards (to determine Human or Cylon) halfway through the game.  You can start out as a Human, and then later become a Cylon.  Also great politics with each player being able to secretly affect other player's strength checks.  I love the suspicion of other players in this game.  Evokes the feel superbly!

Certainly a lot of replayability and a fun game that has everyone discussing afterwards.

I wasn't crazy about the acting in the first season, but I'm on season 3 now, and the story more than makes up for the dull characters.

Notes from a BGG user (a1bert) about playing as the Humans:
The main strategies with the base game are: a) scout a lot, mostly the crisis deck to prevent the Cylon Attack Crisis cards from coming into play, b) move civilians ahead of the raiders and try to jump away as soon as possible, c) if that does not help, shoot down the raiders, d) use Investigative Committee to help passing checks without wasting cards. (And e) learn to decide which skill checks to tank - i.e. purposefully lose.)

Theme meets Mechanisms

Fans of the show can appreciate how the semi-cooperative betrayal mechanism matches the intellectual property that the game is based on.

Pros: Components are good and theme works really well with mechanisms. Even if you are not a fan of the show the art and cards carry the theme through.

Cons: Rather long slog through space while you deduce, accuse, or fool your fellow players.

I initially rated this game much higher since I thought the show was okay at least in early seasons until I dropped it. There definitely seems to be a lot of places in the game where everyone can contribute something useful or find times to hinder the group per the semi-cooperative nature of the game. But I find the game drags on too long for what it is especially if players are slow to commit cards and negotiate while they do so. Adding and resolving the destiny cards just lengthens the process. The ship (game) doesn't move that fast towards the end destination either.

After a few plays I found my dislike for the mechanism plus the length overcoming the initial shine of the game. If anything, this game is so good that I liked negotiation for just a little while.

This game is so hit or miss, it's not even funny. I have both amazing times playing this game, and absolutly shitty times. I made a minor mistask and ended up outing myself as a Cylon early and ended up with nothing to do for the next 3 hours. I still haven't washed the taste of that play out of my mouth yet and probably won't play again for quite some time.

Vet out the crappy modules and always play the original set destination; I've removed cylon leaders, sympathizer (use the cylon leaders goals instead, the sypathetic cylon), new caprica crap, all the trial stuff (or destiny or whatever its called).

This is some of the most fun I've ever had playing board games and remains one of my top picks of all time. The layers of deception and uncertainty paired with some of the best mechanics for interpreting an IP.

This is the best game I have played so far. The players have to cooperate, but have to figure out which of them is/are secretly sabotaging everything. Every game session is different and trickery is a worthy adversary for every human.

Our games usually take over 4 hours (if humans get to travel 8 distance), less if they are killed before ;).

Everyone is involved along the whole game, and the tension and paranoia raised in a good game is not comparable to any other game I know.

Oh, and if I do play it, you can count on me NOT being a Cylon.  In a dozen or so plays, I've never been a Cylon.  Except in the last game where I still thought that I was human b/c I'd never been a Cylon before.  That was pretty funny.
Update: still not a Cylon.

Another all-time favorite.  Always exciting, if a bit long.  You definitely have to implement a no cell-phones rule with this one, as everyone has to be paying attention, but if everyone is on, the tension is amazing.

In dit spel zitten er goede en slechte (cylons). Spelers kunnen verplaatsen, ze moeten skill kaarten verzamelen en een goede jump doen. elke beurt komt er een crisiskaart. deze kaart brengt problemen mee voor de spelers. de spelers moeten samen kaarten uitspelen om deze problemen te verhinderen. de cylons proberen de boel echter te verstoren door kaarten te spelen die niet helpen. veel verdachtmakingen, veel intriges, blijkbaar heel leuk, maar ook een hele lange speelduur: minstens 3 uur.

Bears some superficial similarities to Shadows Over Camelot, but looks to have a lot more flavor and more varied gameplay.

UPDATE: Finally played this and had a LOT more fun than I did with SoC.  I've only seen a couple of episodes of the show, so being a fan is not a prerequisite for enjoying the game.

UPDATE: I've since seen the whole series. The first two seasons are spectacular, while the last two are a spectacular nosedive into an abyss of suckage. The game is still a hoot, though!

Tons of theme but very little substance. Far too long. Most actions seem obvious. Lots of downtime between turns, especially if you start chaining Executive Orders. The fact that players can discuss their cards drains tension from the game. Inability to plan ahead a minus.

Probably for people who love BSG and a little role-playing. Just not for me.

RATING: 7
This is a cooperative game, in which players try to root out the Cylon in their midst and defeat the oncoming threats.

I have not seen the series, so much of the experience was lost on me and it is an experience game. I've also only played once. I am a fan of cooperative games, in general, though.

They use a simple, but clever, hidden traitor mechanic, in which players all potentially submit cards face-down to defeat threats, the cards are shuffled, and then players find out if they defeat the challenge. This is nice, because the Cylon player can throw a wrench in the works, without being spotted. Unless, of course, only two people put cards in and some are negatives...

I feel like the game suffers because some players won't want to be the Cylon (and it is random), because they don't have a good pokerface or don't want to be "the bad guy". Also, there are two Cylons one in the first half of the game and one in the second. The problem here, potentially, is that you could be the good guy the first half and develop a nice, healthy hatred for the Cylons and then be forced to be one for the rest of the game!

The first half of the game, I didn't really enjoy at all. I felt the mechanics were somewhat uninspired, other than the one I mentioned previously, and that many of us had very little real impact on the outcome of the game.

The second half of the game, paranoia broke out big-time, with accusations flying and people being sent to the brig. Everyone's every move was being scrutinized and second-guessed. This seems to be the real strength of this game. Even though I eventually came around, I think your enjoyment of this game will be directly proportional to the interest-level of the group you play with.

RATING: 7
Actually a pretty good co-op/treachery implementation in the mold of Shadows over Camalot.
The range of actions and events is much broader than SoC though which holds my interest a lot more. SoC did feel a lot more "rinse and repeat". But where it really shines is the well implemented treachery/loyalty mechanisms where the interworking of skill cards to meet objectives creates some lovely "but who put that in?" moments.
Usual lovely bits from Fantasy Flight, also with the usual plenty of text on cards, but all the text was straight forward and unambiguous.
Good stuff.

An excellent experience in board gaming! Because of the length of the game, I wouldn't recommend this for new gamers, unless they were already fans of the TV show.

For BSG fans, it's an AMAZING experience. The theme immerses you into the game so easily, and knowledge of the show only helps ease into playing. The mechanics aren't the smoothest in the world, and there are other games on the market that emulate the play of this game in less time, but jumping into the mythos is so much fun. The fact that there WILL be a Cylon thrown into the mix makes for some good table banter, and because player interaction helps elevate the play of most any game, BSG works really well in this regard.

Miles better than Shadows Over Camelot, but at the expense of length.  If you don't mind that, it's great and captures the feel of the show really well.  The humans have a really rough time of it.

I think this is my favorite cooperative board game, even if it's not 100% cooperative due to the Cylons.

Would be a 10 if it was a bit shorter.

It's Mafia/Werewolf with some bells and whistles and a Battlestar Galactica theme.  It can provide some good paranoid hilarity, but the strategic depth is a bit lacking for a game that takes as long as it does.

When I first tried this game, I liked it a lot.  At first, I thought that it seemed a bit long...having to jump a distance of 8...and then jump again.  But the more I play, the more I enjoy every minute.  Being a cylon means being really good at deception.  And being human means convincing others that you are not the cylon again....  I keep enjoying each part of this game more and more.  Rather than getting tired of it, I want to play it every chance I get.  And with 700+ games, that says a lot.

Summary:
------------

Battlestar Galactica (BSG) is a semi cooperative game based on the new version of the tv series. The human players try to reach Kobol to win BSG, while the game "attacks" them with ships and crises which can destroy the human resources, if you don't manage to deal with them. 
The nice twist (and in my opinion the real game) is that some of the human players are actually Cylons trying to mess with the human efforts. If they manage to make the human players lose, they win. Because of the secret assignment of the Cylons, you can never be sure who is on your side and who isn't.

Comments:
--------------
* The game is a blast when you're trying to figure out who the bad guys are. It's quite reminiscent of Werewolf in this regard.

* I guess, without the Cylons the game would be rather dull. In order to prevent the negative effects of a crisis you have to play some of your cards and check whether you have reached enough points. This is not very exciting once you know who the Cylons are. In the two games I've played, BSG lost a lot of it's appeal once we knew who the Cylon player was.

* The threads that the game throws at you don't really seem to be balanced. We had a lot of turns where nothing happened on the board and therefore the crises weren't to hard to deal with. On the other hand, I guess you can get unlucky and draw a lot of attack cards (can't remember their real name) and be swarmed with enemy ships.

* Maybe the game is little too long, repetitive and luck-driven. Our second game lasted four hours and we lost because of a bad die roll. Otherwise we would have won. I had the feeling, that this one little die roll was too significant for the time we invested in the game. But maybe it was the Cylon player who didn't have enough experience with the game and therefore didn't bring us down fast enough.

* Like most Fantasy Flight Games there seems to be a little too much chrome. I guess, the game could have been streamlined a little more without reducing the fun. All the extra cards make this game look more complicated than it really is.

* All in all, I'm looking forward to my next game as I think there are still a lot of things to discover.

Grundspiel zur Neuauflage der Fernsehserie. Sehr gutes kooperatives Spiel mit Verräter, super produziert. Die Spieler haben unterschiedliche Rollen und Aufgaben und müssen gemeinsam das Ziel erreichen ohne sich gleichzeitig vom Verräter in eine schlechte Situation manövrieren zu lassen. Extrem hohe Spannung wenn man hinter jeder Aktion der Mitspieler den Plan eines möglichen Verräters vermutet.

RATING: 3
This game is far too bloated for what it wants to do. It is far too long. There are only two types of loyalty cards (cylon or not), which means the cylon is already in trouble because that player is the only one that needs to read their card! The fate deck needlessly confuses identifying the cylon and the "sleeper phase" ugh what a horrible mechanic. The game boils down to you must play to kinda lose so that when you become a cylon later you can help insure the loss. Terrible boring unfun long game. Perhaps the expansions improve it, but I don't care to find out.

I really like this game. I enjoy the theater that seems to come out through this game. This game is not for the extremely tactical gamer though. This game is more in line with Diplomacy, in that, it is the interaction that make you a great player. The rules are a bit clunky, but that really is not the point of the game.

RATING: 7
I've thought a lot about how to rate this game and ultimately have settled on a "7." There are moments in this game of sheer brilliance, but they're surrounded by large swaths of uninteresting play. Ultimately, there aren't enough of those great moments in the overly long play time. There's also a dose of randomness in whether the game is going to be good or bad. When it's good, the game is a 9 (it's still too long), when it's not it's a 5. So, I'll split the difference and rate this a 7. Too bad, because I loved the TV show and the theme: a tightened up version of this would be a winner. If there was ever a game calling out for a second edition, this is it.

I've only played twice, but there are simply too many options available for me to wrap my head around everything.  Unfortunately, I was a Cylon on both games and I never had a chance to read what my Cylons card said without giving it away.  Then I was so busy reading all of the options on the ship, that I never got to read the Cylon options (I also did not want others seeing me trying to figure out what I could do as a revealed Cylon).

Anyhow, I think I will warm up to this game with more plays.  For now, my first experience was barely above mediocre.  My second experience was fun, but only because there were two great hosts who took care of all the text reading and fiddly rules.

Long and boring unless you're a cylon. Was fun in the beginning but turned into thematic treadmill. There is a lot of bits and rules which add nothing but fiddlyness.

I find Shadows of Camelot superior because it's simpler implementation of coop with a traitor.

However both suffer from ugly rule forbidding to tell others exact value of card in your hand. While I understand the need of it, in practice it usually degenerates to exact mapping between values and some words of phrases. Either that or players struggling to convey some information and be vague at the same time. Awkward in any case.

I think this is a game I will enjoy playing occasionally but don't need to own. I'm not a fan of the show which removes one of the thematic hooks and I do worry that if a player ends up in the brig for an extended period that the game won't be much fun for them.

It's all about the traitor/Cylon and the group problem solve of the troubles that beset the Battlestar - played with some beers and friends who are into the show not a bad way to spend a few hours - runs a bit long for what it is.

This is a great game.  I love co-operative play games, and this takes it to another level.  Very hard for the human players to win though, I've found.

Bought 2010-08-07.

Finally got to play it. Not underwhelmed but certainly not over exited either. A game that is fun once or twice a year but more than that and it would get stale very quickly.

I like several parts of this game, such as you never know if you'll turn out to be a cylon later on so don't make things go too well for the humans and so on. The accusations and paranoia before all the cylons are revealed is great fun, but the moment you know who is who the game get much less interesting. Just rinse and repeat until end of game. If it had been playable in half the time it would have been much better as well.

Nothing surpasses Battlestar for me for a fully and totally immersive gaming experience, where in game decisions have weight and consequence in a way that supports the game's imaginative and storytelling potential, tapping into the world of the tv show in a way that no game previously or since has come close to for me.

No matter how many games I play, each is a completely new experience for me, depending on characters, players, loyalties and crisis deck.    

Virtually no other games I've played have even come close to inspiring this kind of appreciation.

The table interaction is non-stop and drives the fun.  It works better than it seems it should.  The game can bog down when players get so into chatting that they forget they have to take their turns.  This seems fun until you realize it's 2 hours in and you're not half finished.  If you can keep it moving, it's a winner.

When I first played this game I thought yeah that was alright and didn't give it much further thought. it wasn't until I'd played it a few times and people asked me about it that I realised quite how pasionate I was about it. This is a great game if you find sitting around for several hours lying through your teeth and manipulating people (Thankfully I do). I haven't purchased it yet but it is right up there at the top, The only downside to this is you really need a good group of like minded players for this one if you get the wrong mix it can easily go down hill and you may get some sad looking faces.

Players are characters from the TV series, trying to either get the humans to Kobol, or prevent it happening.  Cooperative game where players are either human or cylon, a fact that's gradually revealed during the game via either deduction or via declaration.  Players take turns, and during a turn they draw new skill cards (currency to fight off crises), move around the ships, take an action, then advance the cylon cause by triggering events and ship combat.  Humans win if they can "jump" eight units of distance and jump again to Kobol, the Cylons win if they drain the humans of resources, or blow up/board the Galactica.  Very nicely designed cooperative game, that plays cleanly.  It's very long - 3-4 hours looks typical, probably best with 4-5 players, thus won't get played much because of that.  Still, if you're a fan of the show, and don't mind a long sitting, go for it.

Haven't made up my mind about BSG yet. The theme is AMAZING, but I'm still not entirely sold on the gameplay. It's a good set up and all, I'm just not sure it's for me.

Edit 21MAR2013: Honestly, I haven't changed my opinion much about this game since I first wrote about it in 2011. The theme is excellent. The gameplay is ok. I like the atmospher of second guessing, and it is well tuned to almost always seem like it comes down to the wire. But there's not a lot of choice for each player (especially if you're not Admiral, President, or CAG) and turns can sometimes take forever. I like BSG, but the excellent atmosphere it creates doesn't fully conceal it's few (but significant) flaws.

Also, I get it, it's funny to call everyone a cylon for any reason (or lack thereof) whatsoever. Can we please stop making that joke every five minutes??

I had high hopes that this co-operative game would de-throne Pandemic or Shadows over Camelot. But my hopes were dashed, it is ultimately a rinse-lather-repeat affair of contibuting cards to beat a target number. It is a sort of fun experience, but there just aren't enough moving cogs and levers to keep me coming back for more. I'll concede that FFG is improving their track record: components, proofreading, design, and (especially) playtesting are all getting better. Another base hit, but no home runs.

BSG is pretty much the only AT game I enjoy, so it's doing a bunch of things right. The theme is really well integrated; character play is a hoot; the game is the right amount of hard.

Two minor concerns are the game length (we always seem to run over 3 hours) and exponential rules growth in the expansions, but they've done well to make most of the new rules optional... :sigh: I guess I'm just not cut out for Ameritrash.

Idea:
Try to defend Galactica while jump engines prepare. Try to complete enough jumps before population/fuel/morale falls to 0 and cylons win.

Mechanism:
One player is secretly cylon and tries subtly sabotage and play to cylons bag without being detected. Each player does two actions per round and then 'encounter' happens which either brings more units or disaster that has certain number which must be beaten by discarding cards (1-5 points each) so that others dont know value but amount. Thus cylon tries to play negative and others positive cards.

to whom:
best played with 4-6 players, takes maybe 2-3 hours, pretty easy mechanism but has some nice interaction.

Only played once but I was really impressed at how well this game was pulled off. It includes everything I was looking for in a BSG game. The only thing I didn't care for was the space fights. Kind of a pain.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
DEAL-BREAKER: Gameplay seems too plodding.  A bit too many mechanisms, each of them rather uninteresting on their own.

I like my for my co-op games to not exceed a certain rules complexity.  This is so that the game can thrive on the player "social" interaction rather than worrying about parsing the rules.  I think that Lord of the Rings and Pandemic both get the rules depth about right.  I think that both Shadows Over Camelot, and to a greater extent, BSG, start to really push up against the rules complexity that I'm comfortable with for this type of game.  However, that being said, I think that BSG is still on the proper side of the line, and all the game's systems serve the goal of giving the players some interesting things to base their actions around.  

So far, I've played twice, both times with the same 4 players, and both times the Cylon gave herself away very early, which I think severely hampered the game.  Also, I'm not a fan on the Sympathizer rules, which are both too fiddly and not much fun for the person who draws that card.  I think next time I'll try to find more players or try the "no sympathizer" variant.  

I am eager to try this again, and I want to be a Cylon!

UPDATE:
Okay,I got my wish and got to be a Cylon.  This happened a little past the halfway point when the revealed Cylon pushed his other card to me.  Despite that, I was able to avoid being pegged as toaster until the turn I revealed during the run to the last jump.

I think the game does a great job of setting the atmosphere and creating tension, but I find the gameplay to be too ponderous.  I think I'm changing my opinion that this game was on the good side of the complexity line.  It's actually not so much the complexity as the plodding pace it had for us as we went though every step, shuffle, and math at each turn.  I had assumed that the game would smooth out a bit with more play, but it hasn't.  After tonight's game, I don't know that I would choose to play this again over something else.  Just too long.  

I also am terrible at remembering to use the characters' negative abilities. 

I think maybe Shadows Over Camelot has the better approach.  Overall, Shadows is certainly less thematic, but it still gives a good measure of the hidden traitor vibe, and more importantly the mechanisms are simple enough that they get out of the way of enjoyment of that aspect.

I can see why some people love this game, but for the life of me I can't imagine wanting to add more baggage to it with the expansions.

Overall, I would be very happy to play someone else's copy of this, but I don't see myself teaching and leading a group through it again.

A wonderful, involved, intense, semi-cooperative game whether you enjoy coop games or the show or neither.  Your actions essentially boil down to putting out fires on the ship, but the suspicion that one of your fellow players is a traitor make the "game hates you" aspect that much more intense.  This is a great social game, and I have seen players of all levels make impacts for good or for bad, always in entertaining ways.  Relatively easy to play, complicated by side rules and addendums, ultimately extremely satisfying.

RATING: 7
One of the more tense and frantic feeling long games I've played. From the first moment onward you're hemorrhaging resources and can't deal with everything. As a result every conflict feels a little impersonal.

Compared to Dead of Winter, this feels a little more bloated, but with a lot less room to breathe. It also necessitates a high level of play, since a successful cylon can bring down the whole ship with just mildly suboptimal choices.

Hard to get into, hard to deal with emotionally. Excellent if you're in a position to do both.

My second play of this convinced me of the cleverness and fun of this game.  After 7 plays the game has lost some of its allure.  It feels like I experience the same thing every time I play.  It's fun, but not worth the 3+ hours each game.

RATING: 7
The traitor mechanics here are absolutely top notch, no game has ever made me go from just meeting someone at my local game store to staring them in the face and calling them a lying piece of shit in a shorter amount of time. If you buy this game, buy it for that. The rest of the game though is mediocre at best, so if the traitor is discovered to early the game kinda falls really flat. There are definitely better games on the market, but this is still a solid pick up.

RATING: 7.5
With a full compliment of 6 players, this game is on the borderline for our weeknight game sessions.  I begin by loving it!  This title appeals to me on so many levels:  The theme grips me, the pervasive paranoia is felt from start to finish and an excellent cooperative/competitive game.  But, by mid-game (ie. 2½ hour mark) I'm already looking for it to end, knowing I have at least another 1½ hours to go.

RATING: 6
I feel like they tried to model every single aspect of the show into this one game and the result is a bit of a mess.  It doesn't help that most of those aspects use different game mechanics.  For all that, it still doesn't really capture the essence of the show.  But, over all, the traitor in your midst core of the game is a ton of fun.

Struggled to see where the game was.  Spent 2-3 hours rolling dice 3-4 times doing nothing and then it was game over.  Played with both expansions.

Good co-op game, and I don't generally like co-op games.   The primary innovation is the skill check mechanic, where players can secretly contribute positive or negative cards towards the result.  You don't need to know the show, but I'm certain it's a better game if you do.   It can be very random, and you can win thru no fault of your own, so I'm not sure it should be taken very seriously, which is a bit unfortunate given the game's length.  Heavy on theme, so I give it props for that.   It's a good choice for a large group of players looking for a co-op experience and should appeal highly to RPGers also.

[b]Thank you Secret Santa 2010![/b]

Very fun game, just make [b] absolutely positively sure[/b] you play it with the right people. 

On its own merits, the game is a decent (although very repetitive) strategy game that does a fan-fucking-tastic job at porting over its theme into the look, feel and mechanics of the game. Really, it absolutely feels like (the first couple seasons) of BSG. 

However, as just a strategy game it is a little long and a little boring for what it is, although still alright. Where the game positively shines is when it's played with a group of people who are willing to embrace their characters, and yell at each other repeatedly, accusing each other of being dirty Frakking Toasters, and by the Cylons secretly sowing sabotage and discord in the fleet. This game needs that 'above the table' element more than almost any other out there - which in my experience often doesn't happen with the people I know, unfortunately. Without that element, after a few plays it becomes "Oh look, another water shortage. Yawn..." 

It also absolutely needs 5 or 6 people, probably with the No Sympathesizer variant.

I know, for many people, that Dead of Winter 'replaces' BSG, but I couldn't disagree more. For one, as a fan of the BSG series, I love how much BSG simulates the feel of the struggle against the Cylons (and other humans!) In contrast, I couldn't be less interested in The Walking Dead - while not the direct theme of Dead of Winter, fans of the popular zombie series will find parallels that will appeal to them.

I also prefer BSG's traitor system - no 'secondary objectives,' just a team with a traitor working against them, with the Destiny Deck being sufficient for introducing doubt. The second-phase of the traitors, where someone may discover they're a Cylon, is perhaps of my favorite moments in any board game.

It's very complex for what it is.  You're trying to run a deduction game to figure out what the other players' loyalties are.  But wrapped around this is a hand management game, a resource/risk management game, a space combat game, and so on.  Parts of this are interesting &/or fun to me, others are not.

The difficulty can be very random, like most co-ps.  With the attack cards spread throughout the deck, the pilots may be scrambling to fend off enemy ships, or sitting around with nothing to do.  You could get a series of brutal crises that target one resource, or a bunch of less difficult and less focused ones.  A lot depends on whether you get 2, 1, or 0 cylon cards randomly dealt out at the start.  If they stay in the deck till the sleeper phase, the human players have a much better chance.  

There are a lot of things that feel like odd choices or rough edges.  The game can be tough enough (see above) that you can be well on your way to losing even if everyone at the table is loyal.  I'm not entirely convinced that the cylon players shouldn't just reveal early and start throwing a wrench in things rather than pretending to help.  It doesn't seem possible that the players could make progress in a tug of war between 3 of them and 2 enemies who have the game's entropy on their side.  I guess that's a lot of the strategy.  You know you're going to deplete resources either quickly or slowly, it's just a question of whether you'll run out before limping across the finish line.
You can play loyal for half the game, then suddenly switch sides (without any choice in the matter).  Some players might even try to avoid helping too much in the first half, just in case they have to undo that work in the second.  
In this version, there's also a very forced kind of decision where, with some player counts, one person is a cylon sympathizer.  They'll join whichever team is doing the worst.  Practically speaking, this means that you want to do well in the first half, but not too well.  You need to ensure that one of the resources reaches the red before the sleeper phase, or the odds shift dramatically against you.
The secrecy rules, even once clarified in the errata, are still somewhat ambiguous.  The game's problem is that it gives you a decent amount of information, but there's too much for even an experienced player to keep track of.  Who put how many cards into which check, who draws what colors, what off-color cards showed up, who has access to colors outside their skill set, and that's just the beginning.  You'd have to have a mind like a steel trap to track all these variables.  That's what makes it so frustrating.  I feel like I almost could track it, but the process would be too taxing.  I'd either have to take notes (which I've never seen anyone do), or insist that the game be played at a pace that allows for such calculation.  Many of the people around here are actually quite good about keeping information open (declaring how many cards you're putting into a check, etc.), but every time you miss something or it isn't said, that's a delay when you've got to stop and ask them, and the game takes long enough already.  
Add in the fact that I don't think people (esp. as the human team) really play that well a lot of the time, and it can get more frustrating still.  There are a number of actions that people seem to consistently undervalue, and giving fellow players an opportunity to prove their loyalty (or an opening to sabotage while you're keeping tabs on them) seems under-used as well.  As an example of the kind of tactics that are overlooked, consider the once-per-game abilities.  I've always advocated for using them at the right time in the first half of the game.  People have the tendency to try and save them for the perfect time, instead of using them at a merely very good time.  It's very easy to forget what your own super move is and when's the best time to pull it off, let alone the other 5 at the table.  This gives the cylons excellent cover to 'forget' to use theirs, and when a time comes up that they can use the ability harmfully rather than helpfully, they'll do so.  If you use these them before the halfway point, you won't be losing the ones from players who turn against you in the sleeper phase, and they wont have them to use harmfully.

So, the whole experience is kind of schizophrenic.  It's stuck somewhere between a strategy game and a deduction game.  It's nice that it's a real game you're playing, and not just 2 people going back and forth ("You're lying!"  "No, you're lying!").  The fact that there's some actual meat on the bones makes me more inclined to play than a lot of the other social games.  But at the same time, the game isn't that interesting without the team element.  And the signal to noise ratio in deducing who's on what team is way too low.

The best coop/traitor game there is. The best feature of BSG is that players always have something to do and are focused all the time so there is virtually no downtime between turns (Especially with Executive Order card).
And the fact that goes so much well with the theme puts it even higher on the list of my favourite board games.
It is much more fun when you role play the characters from the series. I love to play Zarek and bring the confusion to the Galactica even as a human just because humans can't be trusted when given the privileges.

[b]Update:[/b] Expansions add more characters and crisis cards but they add so much more in modules and bits that the game gets pretty watered down. After playing few games with all expansions I kinda wanted to play base game only from then on.
[b]Update:[/b] Rating dropped from 8.5 to 8.4 due to the lack of interest.

too long. Its possible to put player out of action, so for them it becomes even longer and boring. For a game of its length, its very random. The roles the cyclons draw at the start (president, admiral) are really crutial. The early draw of some nasty cards is pretty key to their chances as well.

Captures the TV show well though.

RATING: 5
A game that asks: who are we REALLY? The answer: maybe a robot....?

There is no game here, especially once the cylons are revealed. The 'game' is simply a context within which the cylons have room to deceive. When the deceit is over, you are matching random cards to other random cards without much strategy. And it ALWAYS drags. What's worse, the promise of the premise always drags me back, and I ALWAYS get burned.

Traded away.

This game is something else.  If you're a fan of the show, you'll love it to pieces, but if you've never seen a single episode, it doesn't matter.

BSG has everything in it - solid mechanics and social interaction.  The traitor mechanic works wonderfully and a lot of thought went into helping those Cylons stay hidden.  In contrast, a game like Resistance has similar elements, but it's much easier to sniff out the traitor and keep them out of the game.  Here, even if the Cylons are revealed, they can still wreak havoc for the humans and it's just so beautifully weighted.  Up until that moment, enjoy the little looks, winks, and nods as people try to suss out just who at the table is working against them.

The meat of the game is voting.  Sure, there's a bunch of ship combat that keeps tension taut, but what really drives the game is, like Resistance, secret votes to prevent disaster for the fleet.  Cylons will have ample opportunity to swing those votes, but if you're paying careful attention, you might be able to figure out who's doing it just by observing the cards that are laid out.

The diamond to be found, however, is really how many paranoid people you can sit at the table and have a good time.  Wild accusations, finger pointing, and acting upon hunches by locking up the innocent in the brig or firing them out the airlock is what makes this game a blast to play.  If you prefer multiplayer solitaire, move along and pretend you didn't read any of this.  If you're looking for a good time with friends, this is the one to bring to the table.

Not so many decisions as one would expect. Your actions are pretty obvious. However it wasn't so bad untill I become the third cylon in the middle of the game because people were doing quite well and the game was totally spoiled by this action. From that point on it was a masacre of the humans and I had the least fun not having the special card or not having the possibility to activate the cylon fleet. As I became the cylon my choices were even more limited taking away all the fun.
Changed the rating from 5.5 to 6 after the second game which was a bit more tense.

Going to buy it. Heard a lot of good things about Battlestar Galatica. Sounds like a must have. Looking forward in trying this game for the first time.

Update: Played my first game. The game was a blast. Excellent game. Want to play it again soon. Although, I wonder about balance issues. There were talk at the table after the game that all the games played before by my friends, that the Cyclons won each time. It can take 3-4 hours to play a full game, but if your enjoying this game like I did, time isn't an issue. Best first impression of a game in a long time.

From what I see after one play, its a must played at 6 players. Paranoia and accusations until cyclons decide to show themselves.

Update: I played Battlestar for the second time. It was a 6 player game. Cyclons won again. I actually send a human in the brig by accident. I guess you need to be more prudent when you send someone to the brig. We got our asses whoop a whole lot more than the first game. The 2 cyclons cards were out right from the start. The sympathizer was on the cyclons side. The two cyclons players played very well their role.

Like many great AT games, the rules are solid enough to provide a structural framework, while still allowing for emergent narratives and meta-strategy.  I like games with hidden traitors but they can be hard to get right -- Bang! and Shadows Over Camelot each fall short in a variety of ways.

BSG nails it thematically and mechanically ... almost perfectly.  It's not a pure negotiation game like Diplomacy, nor a pure exercise in mechanics like Puerto Rico, but somewhere nicely in between -- you negotiate over what the optimal mechanical choice actually is, and then try to navigate the in-game consequences people who disagree can inflict on you.

One minor quibble is that I think the game might be better without the Sleeper Agent Phase.  While it is true to the source material (some characters don't find out that they're Cylons until a ways into the series) it produces odd mechanical effects that are at odds with the theme.  E.g., if you're human at the start, it is counterproductive for you to try to do as best as possible, because if you draw a Cylon card, you're now facing an uphill battle against your own prior progress.  So you try to barely squeak by, just in case.  But there's no way (in the show) that any of the main characters would have not fought all out for what they believed -- so the optimal strategy is anti-thematic.  And if you're not playing this game for the theme, why bother?

For the same reason, ditch the sympathizer and play with the No Sympathizer variant from the official FAQ.

However, I criticize because I love.  This is otherwise a stellar achievement.  Best game I've played in 2008 and on my Top 10 list for all time.

What an amazing game, a lot of fun with loads of tension. Who's a cylon? My one problem with this game is if you have never watched the T.V. series it might mean you will find the game hard to understand, as it is completely base on the series. In one of my game groups most of the members have never watched the series and are not likely to and I know the game won't hold their interest (shame). You could not take the theme away from the game and still be able to play it.

RATING: 8.5
Really surprised how much I like this, given I've never seen the show.  Only complaints is that the main classes can be too rigid with regards to what they're 'supposed' to be doing, i.e. the President usually has to sit and draw quorum cards or else he's immediately assumed to be a Cylon.

Never played a game with a 'mole' mechanic like this, really fun.  All the mechanics work well.

April 13-Dinged .5 for the fact that the classes can be too narrow re: 'best' things to do (i.e. president sit and draw quorum cards) and if you don't do those things it's immediate suspicion from the other players.

RATING: 9
Sadly, this game does not hit our table enough.  I'm hoping to change that in the future.

Edit:  ultimately this game has been replaced for us by the resistance.  BSG takes far too long to play and in our group suffers from being too thematic.  If I knew more fans of the show, I am sure we would keep this.

Not a bad game, but fiddly rules and a little long. The premise has been streamlined into better and shorter secret traitor games since its release.

RATING: 5
Thematically, it's a ton of fun with the right people. However, there is a wild swing of fun moments and very boring moments. With Pegasus the game took my group over 6 hours. To me that's borderline unacceptable. The cylon players had so little choice, and the human players were knocking every threat out of the sky as soon as it appeared. Not fun in any way, but it's hard to say no to something five other people are longing to play.

2013-08-19 : Over the years we've played some legendary games of this ... and also absolute clunkers. But when the stars align this game is pure magic.
2017-03-18 : Another 5-player game in which the 2 Cylons were there from the start has convinced me that this needs toning down. Stack the loyalty deck so there's a maximum of 1 Cylon player in the first half.
2017-12-30 : Another magic night where population, fuel and morale went down to "1", food to "2", all raptors gone, only 2 vipers left to fly, a centurion on board, everyone out of cards and still a human win to the dismay of both toasters.

One of my favorites, especially for fans of the show. it delivers the crisis mode the fleet is in all along the course of the game. some of the players are undiscovered cylons (traitors) carefully messing with the well being of the fleet creating a very suspicious atmosphere. it is complex involving piloting and battle in space, leadership, tactics, politics and much more to save the fleet.

A blast. Another Corey K. home run. His ability to translate themes into game mechanics never ceases to amaze me. If you have seen the show you will be amazed at how his FEELS like the show. If you have not seen the show, you can enjoy it anyway. Come on, who doesn't want to be a Cylon? Not for playing everyday, but always good to take out and have some fun every once in a while.

RATING: 6
UPDATE: Sold in an auction. My gaming group doesn't really like the hidden traitor games as much so it was destined to not get a lot of play. If I were to own one "hidden traitor" game though, this would be the one.

UPDATE: I still like it, but I tend to prefer co-op games where everyone is cooperating, like Pandemic.

Initial impressions are very positive. It's like someone looked at Shadows Over Camelot and fixed most of my major issues with it. I feel that I'm really doing something as opposed to the SoC "I'll fight off the invaders by...laying down a straight." I'm a fan of the show, so I feel that BSG takes a lot of the tension from the show and makes it a very interesting game. I am hoping to play it with a larger group than the three players I tried it with the first two times.

The rulebook is much better than the typical coop game rulebook (Lord of the Rings and Ghost Stories, I'm looking at you).

Sold.

RATING: 10
There are so many great things to say about BSG. Let me say that Battlestar Galactica is the pinnacle of a thematic game experience and the mechanisms of the game are heavily intertwined to this theme which is great considering I'm a fan of the source material. I challenge that this game can't be played without the players saying Frak, Toaster, or Skinjob during a game.  People call this a co-op but it's more a team-based game with the 'good guys' not knowing who the bad guys are until a point in the game when they've been caught or they reveal themselves at a critical time to cause harm. It's even worse because in the beginning of the game everyone could be a good guy and then switch to 'bad guys' at the halfway point of the game. You also have to consider that in every game there are two important titles (The Admiral and The President) that are controlled by people in the game. Are they good guys? Are they bad guys? If you try to change who controls these roles, what is the motive?

BSG is more than simply a game, it's a social experience of lies, paranoia, subterfuge and desperation.  Not only is there a game, but often a meta-game: every game but one (7/8) my girlfriend at the time has been a Cylon and I've been Human every game.  My friend Chris has been a Cylon every game he's played so far which has been about 4 or 5.  This makes you automatically assume things and point fingers earlier than usual.  It really makes the game interesting.  I can also revise my statement in that it's probably as fun being Human as Cylon and now that our group has more experience it's more balanced than I thought, maybe even skewed more towards the Humans, especially when you play with the Pegasus expansion.

I'm typically not the biggest Fantasy Flight Games fan but when they make a game that I like, I tend to really like it. It's long (about 2 1/2 hours) but I don't find it's Arkham Horror/Descent/Android long.  There isn't as much set-up and breakdown time in this game which is lovely.  

"In 7 - 10 games, if I still feel the way I do now about it, Battlestar Galactica will be upgraded to a 10 and will be my favorite board game."

Is what I said when I revamped my comments on this game.  This is a 10 and it is my favorite board game.

Previously rated a 7 & Previous Comments: "My initial impression is that the theme and mechanisms of the game are heavily intertwined which is great considering I'm a big fan of the source material.  This game has a traitor mechanism similar to Shadows over Camelot, unlike it's predecessor, you may or may not start as a traitor but also have the potential to become one later in the game.  The game is not perfect however since the balance of power using the standard rules seem to heavily favor a Cylon victory, though some might enjoy the challenge as Humans.  I personally feel being a Cylon would be more fun to play and since the game seems to favor their victory most of the time just seems a bit overkill."

This was my dream game, the second modern game I ever played, and has many of my favourite board game moments. Having said that, my last few games (as of 11/5/17) have been supremely frustrating as humans (including dropping down 3 on the jump track within a few moves due to terrible card draw), and needs to be taken as a thematic experience rather than something more strategic - sometimes the cards WILL determine the winners. So, still my favourite, but I understand this wouldn't be for everyone!

Very fun game experience.  I learned it at a mini-meet and had practically no idea what I was doing or what my options were.  Still, it was a blast and I would love to play again, first having a better sense of the rules, gameplay, options, and strategies.  Not a Cylon!!!

Updated:  Haven't had a chance to play again and am not really interested anymore.  The game mechanics are blind bidding and there's not a whole lot to do except for the psychological aspect of the game.  Not something I am currently interested in, but I can see why it is popular.

After the worst possible outcome (3 cyclons out of 6 players) the humans still won - mainly as the cyclons, limited to 1 card each vote, just couldn't sway the humans to lose, even at a difficulty 24!?

I am getting tired of games with an overwhelming amount of pieces. I honestly don't feel having a dozen different plastic ships and several decks of cards all kind of doing the same thing adds anything to a game. This must only be done for the fans of the theme.

In the end, you are playing werewolf with the hassle of slogging through hundreds of cad plays.

Another great cooperative game.  At one point in my gaming life I thought LotR was the bees knees.  There are so many better coop games now, including this one.  You really got to bring it now with the coop games.

OK, so I'm a huge fan of the show.  The game throws things at you, you respond.  I like the skill check mechanism where everyone throws cards into the pot to determine if something happens, and you don't know who threw which cards.  That keeps everyone involved, and the political elements are neat.  The fan created characters here on the Geek are good.

Keeps players on their toes, never trusting each other. Leads to serious metagaming, which can be a plus or a minus. I always hope to be a cylon, but it seems like I never am.

Love the show.  The boardgame is well themed and a huge improvement to Shadows Over Camelot (a game to which it is often compared).  That said, I generally find such cooperative games lacking in strategic depth and more of a social experience than a great game.  I'll play it most of the time if asked, but it will never be one of my favorites.

Can be a spectacular game when everyone knows the rules and are fans of the show. The game is quite deep and includes a ton of player interaction which is one of my favorite elements in any game. It's one flaw comes when introducing the game to new players, and particularly players unfamiliar with the show. As a theme game, a lot of the driving force, in game jokes and so forth are generated by knowing the show. The game is also very complex. When playing with new players, it will be a lot harder to distinguish a player playing poorly on purpose because they are a cylon, or by accident because they have no idea what they are doing.

(As of [b]3[/b] plays) A fantastic blend of co-op and confrontation with one of the tensest end-games I have ever experienced.

While the gameplay is moderately complex and the playing time is long, the brilliantly executed theme makes it very attractive to casual gamers who have watched the TV series.

[b]1 year verdict:[/b] I still think this is a cool game and wouldn't mind playing again, but I suspect that, 9 times out of 10, I would pick [GAMEID=41114] over it, simply for time constraints.

With the right group this game rise above most. The game is filled with drama and tension and it's hard to win. It has some really interesting choices and lots of great moments. 

The only down-side is that some characters are really weak compared to others, and you may accidentally spend a lot of time not doing a lot because you're exo-ing other players, which isn't fun. That combined with the fairly long downtime brings this from 10 to 8 on my scale.

Ok, I'll admit this game took us 2 plays before we really felt confident playing it.  But if you are willing to learn the game, it really does a great job of catching the feel of BSG.  The traitor dynamic is handled much better than Shadows over Camelot.  Overall a great game, with a steep learning curve.

We had fun with this for a while. Then we screwed up the role deck so that we didn't have enough Cylons. In our next game we screwed up the role deck so that there were too many Cylons. Then we stopped playing, forever.

Never seen the show.  It doesn't matter.  This is an excellent game no matter the theme.  The dynamics of the hidden cylon is inspired.

RATING: 8
As a fan of the show, I'm a little biased here. This game captures the feel of the series, and it's exciting the whole way through (especially when you're being swarmed by Cylons right before a jump!). The rulebook is more cumbersome than it needs to be, so it's probably best to learn from an experienced player instead.

1 play: it definitely has potential for me to really like it.

3 plays: it's starting to feel like there was a good game here, but they lost it among all the tedious card mechanics...

10 plays: i guess if this game was for me, i'd know by now.  Will only play when avid fans are around.

12 plays: still can't tell if i like this game.

15 plays: as i play the expansions more (5 plays), i definitely like the game a lot more.  The pursuit track is a strong improvement, the options are more interesting, and a much larger variety of skill cards is really, really nice.  The base game emphasizes Executive Orders way too much.

RATING: 9
A great implementation of the hidden identity mechanism interwoven with a boardgame. The skill check mechanism is a brilliant way to drive the game forward and add a deductive element. I find there's a bit of a barrier-to-entry with the game in that you need experienced players to provide the savvy required, otherwise things can go off the rails, especially for the hew-mons, er humans, (I'm not a Cylon, I swear). With an experienced group, however, the paranoia can create a truly sublime experience that is similar to but different from its cousin game, Werewolf (of which I'm a big fan). Plus, you don't need as many people for this one as you do for WW. 

My caveats are that it's not a short game, plan on 4 hours, and that it's hard for the hew-mons to win until you get some experienced players who can pick up on the subtleties. But if your group is willing to put in some investment plays, the payoff is a truly unique, challenging, and tense experience. I'd also like to note that I finally got around to watching the BSG series and was only mildly entertainted by it, so affinity with it is no prerequisite for liking the game. If you like WW, Resistance, etc., this is a must try for you.

Note on suggested expansion mix:

Base Game + Pegasus (- New Caprica) + Exodus +Cylon Fleet option (-Ionian Nebula, -Conflicted Loyalties) + Daybreak (-Search for Home Option, -Demetrius)

Game could be fun for about an hour.  Overstays its welcome, and is just more frustrating than fun. Never had a real laugh while playing the game, and the deduction added little to it.  Also, expansions did not add to the experience at all.

Hidden traitor game  w/out hidden movement mechanics.  Everyone is aware what you are doing but nearly every decision has negative results so is all about convincing others the alternative was worse.

Changing my rating to a 10.  Tense and exciting every time we play, tons of interesting decisions.  Not much resource management, but allocation of actions feels very powerful.

What a well-thought out game!  I'm not a fan of the new Battlestar Galactica show, but that has little to do with how well this game plays.

The game starts off with a cooperative feel, similar to Shadows Over Camelot, with that nagging knowledge that somebody (or somebodies) are hidden cylons secretly ploying against you!

I've played seven games (once as Baltar and once as Boomer, each of which have a higher chance to get a cylon loyalty card) and I've always been a loyal human!  My catch-phrase is that my loyalty is "unimpeachable".  :)

The best part of the game is all of the social interaction after the first "bad deed" is detected by the players, and then the accusations fly.  It's scrumptuous to have close friends (even husbands/wives) second guessing each other and listening to the rationalization.

The only downside is that the game can take a bit of time.  Be ready for 3 hours or more.

Nostalgia keeps me from panning this game. Its criticisms are warranted: It's too long, it's not terribly balanced and the social dynamics don't always work as intended (plus, player awareness is so vital). But I've had so much fun sweating over my cylon-ness or second-guessing everyone at the table for hours. And a human victory produces such ecstatic joy that it should be illegal. It was one of FF's first well-produced big-box games at a reasonable price (they didn't overdo it with the minis but the quality is still top-notch). Worth getting if your group is sick of The Resistance and getting into more gamey games.

This game was a "big rating loser" when I re-rated some games in Jan 2017.  It's still a good game, but so many things that have captured that BSG feeling have come up, and BSG is long game.  Plus - social deduction games like this are falling into Group-think in my current gaming circles.

EDIT: After several more goes, I'd say I do enojy playing it, but there is just so much randomness involved that it really doesn't matter how well you play - whether you win or lose would usually be decided on the roll of an 8-sided die.

RATING: 4
It doesn't seem fair to rate this low, but I was completely not engaged with the theme. I'm not a fan of BG, my friends were and loved the game, especially the possible traitor. To my experience, this was another Shadows Over Camelot, with much more limited activity. The fort is beseiged, but unless you're a pilot, you don't really get to do much. Reading actions off a text box on the board? Not my idea of fun.

So here's the thing. The game failed to engage me at all. If it had something beyond the theme, then it should have. If you love BG, you'll thrill to this. Me? Left cold, which means the game failed.  *** I played this again (to oblige), played a pilot, and I was a Cylon from the start. Again, the other players had a blast, really enjoyed the experience. Again, I was left stone cold. There just isn't any significant choice for player action. It's not even that you choose the optimal thing to do. You just have to do the most obvious, because the other options are so weak. If you loved the new series of BG, you will really enjoy this game, it drips with theme. If you are just after a good traitor game, there are better ones on the market, much better.

Para profanos es un buen juego, pero para seguidores de la serie es un juegazo. Consigue trasladar al tablero la mayoría de las situaciones de la serie el ambiente, la paranoia, la psicosis, los ataques, las persecuciones... Todo el tema de los roles ocultos (si eres o no eres cylon) es una maravilla. 
Para cinco jugadores es como mejor funciona.

Though the idea of playing a game based off a sci-fi TV series may be off-putting to a large number of people, I can safely say that despite no one in my groups every having watched a single episode of this great show (except for myself), it has always been a lot of intense and paranoid fun for all.  The core of the game is that you and your fellow crew members are fighting for your survival against a seemingly endless onslaught of robotic Cylons, but one (or more) of you is secretly a traitor, deliberately sabotaging your plans and card skills.

The game is pretty intense even without the traitor, but the paranoia and finger pointing after each failed skill check is quite enjoyable, both during and after play.  Sometimes the game can be a bit too unforgiving, and the Cylon Sympathizer rules are a bit lame IMO (we tend to not play with them), but otherwise this is a favorite of mine, if we can get enough people to play a quality game - you definitely need 5 or 6 players to get the most out of it.  It can be a bit confusing and intimidating for new players, and it, like all Fantasy Flight games, can seem to have an over-reliance of dice rolling and card draws, but the atmosphere of a game of Battlestar Galactica is hard to match.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.8
5 of us played for 2 1/2 hrs and were less than half way through the game.  The Cylon was discovered early and he sat there with very little participation in the game.  The other  of us easily defeated any adverse events.  Just not much happened in these 2 1/2 hours and the Cylon was bored silly.  I much prefer Red November and Pandemic.  Both are much shorter games with much more action and harder to beat.

The possible Cylon(s) & sympathizer mid-game really changed the game the second time I played--we all enjoyed it very much.

3rd game-I hated it.  Never play with 4--always .  So boring.

3/11/10  BSG was good but I was a bit underwhelmed.  I think I waited too long to reveal and I won't choose to be a pilot next time...boring!!!

7/20/10  Played The Resistance twice. Kind of like Battlestar Galactica with all the theme scraped off. Plays very quick.

8/31/10  Played Battlestar Galactica. It's tough with 4 (too tough?) I tried to fix it so we would only have 1 cylon, but the game didn't let me.

8/31/10  @brettspiel There's a sympathizer who becomes a cylon if all you resources are blue. I tried to get 1 in the red so they would be human.

RATING: 8
Wonderful paranoia until a moment of revelation starts a concerted effort to make the final jumps.  Since the Cylons do have a favorable position because the more the humans bicker, the less efficiently they work together.  And the humans must play perfectly together to even hope of winning.  The Cylons have it easy if they can stay under the radar long enough, but at some point they must come out and start pummelling the ship.  I think the best opportunity is when distrust amongst the players is at its highest with hopefully an innocent human already in the brig.  This game has a wonderful atmosphere but it must be played swiftly; I wouldn't sit down for this one with AP players.  That is what likely ruined it for a lot of complaints of long playing times.  My first game took 2h30 including explanations, which I found perfect for this type of game.  The crux of this game is crisis resolution.  Last I checked, the crew didn't have endless thinking time to resolve them...

Best traitor style game I've played

Pros
-Very involved, as players must focus on survival (or destruction) and deducing/maintaining the secret identities of the opposing players
-Regular votes, events with choices (with real impact on your chances of survival), the ability to have titles/roles (like admiral) all add to the game
-Clever use of Destiny deck which adds unpredictability to votes AND hides cylon players
-A player that is caught is not eliminated in the game but rather gains new options to do other things (not just a few lame options)
-The game is highly thematic and accurate depicts both the atmosphere, and the contents of the source material

Cons
-Another long game (3+ hours)
-Difficult to play with people that are not good at games involving a traitor/hidden identities
-Cylon invasions depend on drawing from a deck (changed in one of the expansions). There may be no invasions for awhile, leading to boring and uneven situations (for the cylon players)
-Lacking miniatures for some components (improved upon in expansions)
-Somewhat questionable expansions add-ons

The traitor mechanic is brilliant, and I like the character specific strengths and weaknesses as well as the mechanical emphasis on trust (Executive Orders, Investigative Committees, Scouting, etc). I haven't seen the TV series, but this game makes me interested.

However the game is too long and there are too many decisions that don't matter. Skill checks take too long, are too frequent, and don't matter until the end. This game would be great cut in half.

Many roles suffer high downtime and low involvement; whether the game is exciting or not comes down to the card draws.

The game was good though the last couple of rounds was not a race to the finish but more of a slow death. We played through the whole game, but we knew early on that the cylons were winning. As President I was disappointed to have my ship blown up after only 4 actions. We were playing with two new players (myself being one of them) and the experienced players ended up as cylons. The super crisis' were unfortunately uneventful and the regular crisis' seemed to have a bigger impact on us.

On a second play through the cylons weren't aggressive enough and the humans won easily.

overly long for what it offers, with parts of the game not contributing to the experience. some players at times with nothing to do, and i guess i'm just not personally a huge fan of the hidden traitor mechanic because it can lead to manipulative social dynamics i don't care for.

I have mixed feeling sometimes I would rate this game a 9 other times a 3. Sometimes the game is a nail biter and keeps me on the edge of my seat. Other times one faction gets to much of an advantage and the game just seems to drag. Either way this game takes a bit too long.

RATING: 10
Based on seven plays in a 4/5 player games.

Still a great game with an almost perfect blend into the series. I've been a cyclon about 60% of the time.

From my first game:

5 player game: I was Baltar and a (eventually) revealed cylon. The President (sitting to my right) was found to be an unrevealed cylon and aided the cylon cause greatly with the President's special ability (drawing 2 Crisis cards and selecting one for play).

It came down to my attack of 3 cylon raiders against 2 civilian ships protected by 1 piloted fighter with population at but 2. I rolled an 8 on my first roll, eliminating the fighter leaving the civilian ships to destruction by the other 2 raiders. Each was a population loss, giving the win to the cylons.

The next human player could have made the final jump to Earth.

RATING: 6
For some reason I just don't see the tension building up in this game. And without tension, it just falls flat. The game ended on one unlucky card draw and... well... that was it! The actions you take every turn seem pointless, nothing you do can really turn the game in a different direction. The card game to counter bad events (and the associated deduction) is the only good thing, but it's not enough. Finally, the game becomes even more boring when you're a disclosed cylon. I would say: stay away unless you're a big fan of the show and can bring in your own fun.

UPDATE: Rating went up 2 points. With the right group this game can actually be fun. The mechanics work to create all kind of suspicious situations. It's still very long for what it is, especially since you can get in a very boring situation: lonely Cylon, late-game Cylon, Sympathizer, stuck in the brig, etc. But still, not as bad as I first thought it was.

RATING: 4
I played this only once so my impressions are perhaps too heavily skewed from this one experience - but that one experience left me uninterested in playing again. Why? Because it was very depressing. I was accused of being the bad guy - it turned out I wasn't and nothing I could say or do convinced anyone otherwise. So we all died a slow death because of this. I wouldn't mind so much if the game lasted 30-60 minutes but I ended up spending our entire gaming session of I think 3 hours suffering through this slow death.

I play games to have fun. This was not fun. The rules purposely pit people against each other in an atmosphere of distrust and intrigue. Not for me.

The reason I didn't rate it lower than a 4 was because it was original, well themed, and the mechanics truly did achieve the intended atmosphere.

I understand the allure of the game, the small mindgames that can be played when trying to figure out the cylons, and I don't mind a 3 hour game, but this game just doesn't do it for me. In my opinion the cylon players are really the only ones who get to make interesting decisions, while everyone else just goes through the motions. It basically comes down to 3 hours I would rather spend playing something else.

The thing about co-op games are the person/people who have played the most always tell the others what to do on their turn. Maybe that isn't the case when all the players have played multiple times, but in the couple of games I have played this was what happened. In this game, unless you want to be accused of being a cylon you just let others play your turn for you.

Played 2 times,  The first group was split 3 really liked it, other 3 thought it was a bit long.  Second group was a lot more engaged and had more fun.  Still need a couple of plays to decide if this stays.

Third play went a lot smoother.  I think I have a good group now to play this.  Humans still have yet to win but I think we are getting better.

One minor concern is if the Cylon player plays too conservatively game can take a bit too long, but I will see if that it true with future plays.

Played it three times so far - somebody else's copy. One time - this was the third time for several of us, so as a group we were experienced enough not to have made any mechanics mistakes - the game sort of stalled. Two of us were human and confident in each other and confident we knew who the two Cylons were. The sympathizer had gone over to the Cylon side, and the sixth player wasn't sure who to trust. The Cylons never revealed themselves, and they locked the experienced humans in the brig. There was nothing we could do from that point forward, even once the sixth player realized she'd trusted the wrong pair, because we could never out-vote the Cylons to get out of the brig. Oh, and it didn't help that the Cylons had both the Presidency and the Admiralty. Still, I had a lot of fun the first half of that game and the other two plays.

A little boring for me, not being fan of the series. Ok game and mechanics. I don't see a lot of things going on though for one player. I also don't see the advantage of playing hidden cylon unless you're doing it for the mood of the game.

Update: This game is completely ruined for me after witnessing a game where the cylon player revealed himself from turn 1. All the tension and the paranoia gone, the game was just a boring exercise of skill checks.

RATING: 7
Battlestar Galactica is sort of a more elaborate implementation of the idea behind Werewolves/Mafia. Its biggest improvement (and likewise also its biggest shortcoming, depending on how you look at it) is that it adds a fairly rigid set of rules. The effect is that the game becomes much more complex, and longer, but it also means that there is palpable evidence for whether a player is a human or a cylon.

The process to get there is, of course, rather involved but it is just so much more satisfying to execute someone because of what he (supposedly) did or didn't do than just because he "looked like he did it". That the cylons aren't out of the game just because they've been found out is just another bonus.

You have probably heard this before but: Oh my god, is this game thematic! There is nothing else on the market that puts you in the situation like this game. So much that you can't not roleplay at least a little.

This is a great game to get people who are mildly interested in board games, to play something. It looks really appealing, it's easy to get the hang of it, and it is very social.
On the other hand, if I gave a rating based on how I feel towards this game, it would probably be around 4. I do not feel as if there are any hard decisions to make, most of the time finding the optimal action is simple. For me it feels like a variant of werewolf, where most of the additional rules just provide a frame. This would not be a problem, but I think that a lot of in-game interaction got lost somewhere.
I give this a 6, because the first two plays were fun, and because I consider it to be a good gateway-game.

After 50 or so plays this has got a little stale, as my game group can game every aspect of the game to such a large extent.

Fairly well balanced and each game has different threats to deal with and a variety of different options.

Battlestar Galactica is a solid card driven co-operative game, with good mechanics, and with the right group of people, it's great fun to play. In fact, it’s probably the best TV series theme game that I have ever run across. So what's not to like? Well, all that being said, it definitely shows signs of being a rushed production. For example: there are 5 skill decks of about 20 cards each, but each skill deck only has 2 different events. Why? Or again, the Cylons can board Galatica, but once there all they do is move up a generic track. Why couldn’t they have taken over different parts of the ship? Or the combat: the Vipers roll an 8 sided die and either kill a Cylon raider or not. And once the main ships jump all the small Vipers do too. Why not add some tension with the Vipers being possibly lost or damaged if they fail to return on time? Or the rules booklet: the rules seem all to be there but trying to find them when you need them is a chore. Organizationally they need plenty of work. Or the crisis deck: each crisis - and there are an awful lot of them - doesn’t seem particularly crisis-filled. In a 4 hour or so game (with 6 players), a typical crisis would have you lose one population, or one fuel, food or morale point. But as you start with about 10 points worth of each of the different supplies - 40+ in total - the first hour or more is not that dramatic. In other words, why give up obvious chances to add tension and interesting details to the game? Yes, it would make a long game longer and I know that euro-based game designers worry about creating long playing games but as Battlestar Galactica ends at an arbitrary 8 jumps, it seems to me easy enough to have made  it an arbitrary 6 or even 5 jumps instead and pack it with tension. The bottom line is that Fantasy Flight Games missed a golden opportunity to publish a superb product. Its skeleton is there, but the accompanying muscles are not.

I've never watched the show, but I got this for my birthday and after playing it once, I am gonna watch the show (even though I don't necessarily like sci-fi). This game was amazing! And even though I got both cylon cards AND the admirer card (I had the character that gets 2 cards at the start) and I wasn't sure on what to do, I had a great time watching the others blaming each other and coming out on top.

The fact the Corey K. managed to sew in the feeling of the show so friggen amazingly well into a box of paper and plastic and rules, well, he is to be proudly commended.  No game gets me this involved.  A piece of art in the board gaming world. Perhaps a little too simple and straightforward for the Sympathizer, but when a Cylon finally reveals themselves, the mutual joy of human annihilation keeps the game strong.

This is a fun game, but not as good as I thought it would be. In our first 4-player game, we've got one cylon sympathizer who became cylon after midway, and right on that turn all the humans had the mishap of losing all their cards. It became a tense but obviously lopsided battle from then on. So the game doesn't seem very well balanced. Will try again though.

First, I'm a bit biased on this game, as I love the tv show. And although this might no be a precondition in liking this game, I still do it, especially for BSG being a semi-cooperative game.

Too long between turns (4 player games), to slow overall. Too lucky. Takes an 7-8 on a 8 sided dice to hit which is lame. Maybe this would be better if I was a BSG fan, but I'm not so the theme, such as it is, is lost on me.

Only played once at a player count of 3, but it seems like this suffers from long, monotonous gameplay, although I really like the core mechanisms, so I need to play a few more times to solidify an opinion.

I'm not a big fan of hidden traitor games but this one is my favorite one. I think the way the cyclons are setup in this game is very good, especially the mid way point to balance the game.

Unlike other traitor games, I feel a experienced group of humans have a chance of winning almost every games which is very cool. This game benefits a lot from experience, knowing the cards in the deck and using a balanced configuration of expansion modules/right player count

The highs in this game when setup well and played with an experience group are amazing. There is so much you can do in this game and everything is very thematic and can be customized to be very well tuned

This is one game that looks a lot more complicated that it is!

One might be forgiving for feeling overwhelmed by the sheer number of things to do, but everyone I have taught, even those without much Boardgame experience, has really come round to understand it.

Some might not favor its complexity but I love it! Complexity does allow the "traitor" players (Cylons) to craft very very devious plans, and when it all comes together it is very very satisfying. Other social deduction games like Bang or Resistance lack that extra layer to afford the truly devious/shrewd players the extra burst of gameplay that brings the experience to a higher level.

If I had anything bad to say, it is that the Base Game alone does lack quite a bit. Pilots aren't quite as useful. Cylon attacks too random. And oh, sympathiser I do so detest thee. But with the expansions (and your choice of addons from them) I'll say this is pretty much the most entertaining board game I own.

Second play: used MasterDinadan's ultra-short variant.  It drastically improved the game.  You can find it here:

[filepage=53543][/filepage]

Rated 4 after one play.  

The game is far too long and repetitive and starts feeling even longer and more repetitive after all the Cylons are revealed.

It is fun, but it is criminally overlong....  Fun-per-minute is incredibly low.  

The fun part is the uncertainty associated with not knowing of who is on which team.  Once that is removed, you're turning the crank for far, far too long.

The game needs a sudden-death provision that is triggered by the revelation of all Cylons, or at least needs a "speed up" mechanism that kicks in from that point forward.  The problem is that the reverse happens, the game bogs down...

Terrific game.  The number of characters to choose from plus "Who's a Cylon this time?" plus the way the crises play out make for a lot of replayability.  Be forewarned, though, that your first games will take well over the two hours suggested on the box, and if you're playing it with several folks who are new to both this game and games of medium complexity or above, you're looking at well over thirty minutes of rules explanation before you can get going.  The fiddliness was necessary to get the TV show's flavor down so well but man, is it ever fiddly.  I mean, Agricola is easier to teach.  Just the same, I won't be surprised if my rating of BSG keeps inching up; Nov. 2008--8; May 2009--8.25.

I like this game, but I may have to drop the rating if continued plays show that the Cylons have an advantage even with experienced players.  

Edit:  the game is starting to lose its appeal to me.  Partly due to the aforementioned balance issue, but largely this is simply due to my tremendously bad luck at the game.  I've been on the losing side all but one play, including the one time I got to play as a Cylon.  Normally a good game holds my interest regardless of whether or not I win, but with a game where at least 1/3rd of the players should win, the losses are getting old.  I'm sure I'll play more in the future because most people I game with still like this, but it's probably no longer one I'll suggest.

Simply put: a superb game. The awesome feeling that comes when the game is on the line, you know one of your fellow shipmates is a dastardly Cylon and you have to make a call. Who do you trust? That tension filled moment, with your cylon buddy trying to stay calm and cool under pressure; your human pal desperately trying to convince you that [i]he's[/i] innocent. Who do you trust? No matter your choice, that moment, and the big reveal to follow, will be remembered for many game sessions to come. Awesome in it's purest form.

The little to no downtime is also a really nice feature for a game that can take a few hours.

The only downside is it's best with 5 players and my group usually tops out at 4. Still, it's a lot of fun.

Bit fiddly for my tastes, if that's the right term. Better than the resistance - more depth. Still, not up my alley, like games in that vein (i.e. Werewolves). Would take 2 rooms and a boom (less depth, but more fun party game) over the lot.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
There's nothing particularly interesting about the core game mechanics in [b][i]Battlestar Galactica[/b][/i]. Without the traitor mechanism, this would probably be a pretty boring game. For example a critical game aspect is the skill check where you turn over a card and then, as a group, play cards that equal or exceed a listed number with some extra cards thrown in for randomness--not terribly exciting on its own. But saying BSG is boring without traitors is like saying an omelette wouldn't be filling without the eggs. The addition of cylons (hidden traitors) takes this game to a great place because the simple skill check, for example, becomes a weighted probabilistic loyalty test: Is this check important enough that a cylon will try to sabotage it? Who is in position to betray? Two pilot cards were revealed, are these the extras or is our pilot against us? Hidden traitors, combined with how easy it is for the humans to lose the game, make decisions feel important.  These elements combine to turn a game of BSG into the tensest most paranoia-filled 2 hours in all of board game-dom. 

Being a fan of the series (or at least of science fiction) definitely helps. If you cannot role play your character to some amount and instead choose to focus on the game play separate from the theme you might be underwhelmed. This isn't to say that there aren't interesting choices outside of the theme (there's enough probability and hidden information to keep anyone busy), but the game is strongest when you, for example, call Lt. Valerii a frakking toaster.

I have a soft spot for games that encourage deceit; BSG does not disappoint.  Some interesting thematic elements that appeal to fans of the show, but it's a solid game even without exposure to the TV series.

Game times can, unfortunately, vary quite a bit.  An efficient game might clock in around three hours, but a game with lots of cylon combat and a bit of AP can stretch out beyond four hours.

The Cylon Sympathizer is not a terribly fun balancing mechanism.  I plan to try the official "No Sympathizer" variant the next time we have 4 or 6 at the table.

The Pegasus expansion has gone over pretty well with my group. We exclude all the "New Caprica" rules, which add unnecessary complexity.

I could take or leave this game. The down time kind of annoys me, but the main thing is that when it first came out.

Calling this a "cooperative game" is a SERIOUS misuse of the word - it's a game about traitors & trust. I give it high marks for evoking the feel of the series as well as creating a relatively clean gaming environment through smart implementation of cards & rules.

I'm a little worried about what the expansion will due to game balance & enjoyment, though.

RATING: 7.5
After many more plays, I've raised my rating on this. It really has a great theme, and both fans of the show and those unfamiliar with it enjoy themselves.
I've taught it to non-gamers, and they've had fun (although one was overwhelmed). The gameplay starts slow but gets faster. We've played 3 and 4 player games in about 1 and a half hours, without ending early.
It's just a lot of fun. Try it out!

Update:
I like the game, although the expansions are a mixed bag. I feel they mostly add unneeded chrome, when really the game is about pretty simple mechanics and fun social interaction. It's still a fun ride, though.

Very thematic and extremely immersive, definitely non-cooperative game. Or maybe semi-cooperative ;-) The only downside is that it takes 3 hours and 6 players to play it right which is not something you always have at your disposal.

Fun, interesting and mostly rewarding game that works better in the beginning than towards the end. The crisis solving system and hidden Cylons are very clever mechanics, but towards the end when the Cylons are revealed, it becomes somewhat cumbersome race towards the finish line that is more likely to be crossed by stumbling, rather than by some brilliant piece of maneuver.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.8
This is a great game! It is a solid coop game to begin with, but the traitor element is implemented excellently and tension builds quickly as soon as people start making decisions.
My last 5 player game, I was convinced that 2 of my fellow humans were cylons, and it turns out I was dead wrong. Myself and another human player nearly released the cylon from the brig! Luckily, the other two humans stopped us (which further convinced us of their cylonic nature) and all the while we are all trying to escape before the board controlled cylons take out the Galactica. 
This is a good example of the zany confusion that can occur, and the game does an excellent...maybe perfect...job of allowing these kinds of interactions to take place. 

The game does have a couple downsides.
1: Its long. I like to pretend it will only take a couple hours, but it usually takes upwards of 3. That's not bad in our group, but for some it may be too much.
2: It most definitely works best with 3 and 5 players. For balance purposes, in a 4 player game there is 1 cylon and 1 cylon supporter. The cylon supporter is essentially 1/2 of a cylon. You don't get all the cylon abilities, but you have to reveal immediately and get the negatives. If you're unlucky enough to be the supporter, it kind of sucks (unless I'm missing something.) In a 3 and 5 player game, you have 1 cylon and 2 cylons respectively...no supporters = more fun for all.
Also, while on the subject of number of players, I actually find this game quite entertaining with just 3 players, which is a rarity for bluffing/social deduction games.

TL;DR
This is a great game with 3 or 5 players if you like making crazy unfounded (or well founded) accusations about loyalties all the while trying to either destroy or save the BSG as it journeys to its new home.

Blends the basic concept of Shadows Over Camalot traitor wonderfully into the theme of BSG. But BSG supports this much better than Shadows and adds a lot more depth to game with the various multiple actions beyond intrigue and quests. Also once the traitor is discovered here they have much still to do, which I don't feel you do in Shadows.

This is a great game.  It plays smoothly and while perhaps a tad too long, the metagame is wonderful.  The game is incredibly tense and are usually close, almost always going down to the last jump in my experience.  I have had some of the most hilarious, table pounding fun times playing this game.  Pure genius.  It is well designed and totally self contained.  On some level, I cannot imagine playing an expansion to this as it is perfect how it is.

Of late, I've been finding that it goes a little too long which knocks off points.  It could stand to be calibrated for 3 jumps of length.

The game is a tough one the first time you play it with inexperienced players, especially if they are dealt a Cylon.  If there were some way to guarantee that 1st time players were not dealt Cylon, that would be great in terms of gameplay.  But, of course, that would ruin the game.

While the theme and gameplay mesh fairly well, I never felt like my decisions were that important in how this played out. It's a bit of a guessing game at times, the accusations are fun...but for the length and tablespace this takes up, it seems poorly designed. Pretty 'meh.' It probably doesn't hurt if you're a Galactica super fan. While I enjoyed the show, it's not something I find myself quoting or rewatching.

One of my favourite games, yet it needs to be played with the right group of people.

The game is designed with an engine that would possibly defeat the players on the long run. However, players have a bunch of very effective options to win. But... surprise! Some of them are (or become) Cylons, human-looking evil robots trying to defeat humanities. 

The group needs to find out the traitors between its ranks, and jail or execute them.

The game is quite long compared to other traitor games (Shadows over Camelot, The Resistance), but if you have the time (120-200 minutes) and a dedicated group, you are in for a hardly forgettable experience.

RATING: 6.5
Very good game in its genre. But of course it has flaws typical of its genre, i.e. lots of rules and text, huge downtime, long game. On the other hand pretending to be a human (while you are a cylon) or guessing who is a cylon - these are really great aspects of the game. To sum up - I can play it from time to time.

The best traitor game I've played. The most thematic game ever and also very fun, I like that you can play half of the game without a traitor. My one play of it was far too long though, over 5 hours, but we were 5 and only one had played before. I'm sure the downtime can be cut down considerably.

EDIT: After playing with 4 experience players and 1 new, once again for 5 hours, I think I can say that this is simply a long game. It did take over 1 of those hours to explain and refresh rules, compounded by the poorly laid out rulebook. It's definitely worth those hours, though. Although it felt rather slow at times when playing, I couldn't stop thinking about the game for hours after and that is a sign of a good game.

EDIT: After my third play, with Daybreak, we managed to reduce the time to 3h + rules, this time with 2 new players. I can definitely see the game getting more fun and quicker, so with my main downside getting better, I increased my rating.

Awesome game, can't get enough of it.

The 7-player match I've played was some of the most fun I've ever had with a boardgame, individual turns were taking 10 minutes and we were all loving it - tension was high, accusations were dropping left and right and after 5 hours of game everyone was thoroughly pleased.

The only real drawback is that it becomes a lot less fun with 3 or 4 players, and you simply have to play a no-sympathiser variant - that card ruins any fun you could have.

"Your a cylon!" The greatest thing to say in a game. The only reason it doesn't get the full 10 is I do notice when it is not a person's turn they tend to sidetrack or pass the time with something else. Which is understandable. Will not play with less than 5 people. I do not think the game is fun unless their is 2 cylons. This is true two reasons: cylon found early or the single cylon is not that good/new. and with four players, you have the cylon sympathizer, which I hate!

Feels a lot like Shadows Over Camelot, but I like the traitor mechanism and traitor protections in BSG better.

The "half-cylon" solution of a sympathizer bothers me a little, since you can game the system by deliberately breaking the ship, but I can't think of a better solution. For that reason I think it works best with five players.

Be warned, the playing time estimate is flaky. Like Werewolf, if players get really into discussing who the traitor is the game can get a lot longer. Just running the mechanics might be able to finish in two hours, but I've seen most games last at least three.

It's a good game even if you're not a fan of the show (I'm not).

An excellent game.  Probably the best Team Game I have played.  I had originally always compared this to Shadows Over Camelot, which isn't really a good comparison.  Shadows is a co-op game that could have a traitor in it.  This is not a co-op game, this is definitely a team game.

First Impression: BattleStar Galactica does a brilliant job of transporting you into the world of the Series.  Players co-operate to escape the Cylon threat aware that one or more among them may be Cylon sleeper agents or sympathisers. The voting/bluffing and inevitable accusations increase the player interaction and make this a truly enjoyable game.

RATING: 5
Great theme with an interesting voting mechanism with the skill cards, but a disappointing game. During 2:20 in a 6-player game I was a (human) pilot making 6 turns without any real decisions and I started to do other things to distract myself, which I rarely do. There was very little interesting discussion as in other good cooperative games like Pandemic, Shadows over Camelot or Lord of the Ring. Reminder to myself: avoid this game in the future.

RATING: 8.5
BSG is one of my favorite games. The tension and politics is amazing. The game play itself is also very good. The 8.5 reflects two issues, first fleet balance (addressed in expansions). Secondly, the game is I think more complex than it needed to be. The core tension of humans vs cylons is great, the number of rules to support it is not.

One of the best games ever to truly capture the essence, tension, and theme of the property that it's based on.  That said, even those that are not fans or are unfamiliar with the show will usually find great fun with this game.  The only possible downside is the playtime of 3-5 hours depending on the amount of players and their familiarity with the rules.

RATING: 5
Set in space, players are either humans trying to accomplish a mission and travel to Cobol or trying make them fail. What role you are is not revealed at the start of the game. Therefore it is a game of treachery by sabotaging without it being obvious or trying to beat the game.

My opinion is not affected by the TV-series since I haven’t seen it, but I am intrigued with the theme and how it seems to be executed. I find the traitor mechanic work really well where there is a fine balance for the cylons before revealing. Despite its archaic mechanics, I find that it is usually very tense. I appreciate the game more after playing it a few times as you get into the system and understand what cards are good or not.

Played with 4; unlikely to get more players in the near future.  I liked how the Crises mechanism got all the players involved (as opposed to solo quests in "Shadows Over Camelot").  On the other hand, having a "guaranteed" Cylon was less appealing than the random Traitor in SOC.  Want to get more table time before making a firm decision on this rating.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
One play with five. When you're fighting off raiders and everything is going haywire, it's quite exciting. I assume that the hidden traitor element is going to be a lot of fun as well, though that didn't work out in a satisfying way in our particular game. The "jump" mechanism is also very cool, giving the game an interesting rhythm. The negative is that it's a long game and there's a fair amount of down time. In particular, things can get pretty dull for a Cylon player who has been exposed.

Also, I think it's kind of a cop-out when a special ability in a cooperative game is to give your actions away to someone else. How is that fun?

2 caveats to start; 1) I only played a partial game and 2) I have not seen the show.  That said, this game had a great feel, and some fun mechanics. I can see how fans of the show would absolutely love this game. In the meantime, I'd definitely play again and will likely look into watching the series...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Rating after one 5pl and one 4pl game. Most cooperative games fail with me as they don't offer any interesting decisions to take. This one is different. Table talk is important and unlike Shadows over Camelot, in BG it's useful to reveal the traitor/Cylons. Here you must work together and not like in SoC just send one player there and the other overthere. Clearly superior in terms of "working togehter". However, being suspected being a Cylon, then being thrown into the brig but you are human hurts a bit... just like in real life. Not all characters are equal fun to be played. Winning is very hard because of fuel shortage. I wished that the skill cards offered a bit more distinct actions, as the ones on the board are very limited. The game is fun but can also drag a bit.

I absolutely loved this TV series, so i don't see how i can possibly dislike the board game.  Some of the guys in my group are attempting to watch the series and don't want to play it until then.  Man, if they'd just watch the movie they'd be hooked.

RATING: 6
Can be really long (hours).
I found the game quite interesting. Complicated enough to give nice choices.
It can be, however, frustrating a little for revealed Cylons, and very frustrating for accused innocent humans.
Quite difficult to keep track of what's going on precisely. Especially if unrevealed Cylons act smart and are convincing at the same time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
the core of the game isn't in its mechanics, its in the sheer interaction between players, both cylons and humans trying to convince the others to meet their own agenda.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Long game. Things are interesting until the cylons are hidden and as they reveal all the shit hits the fan. 
Then it is a slow slow death...

I found actions a little repetitive and the decision making tough but not excruciatingly so, as I would have expected instead. Finally I have some concerns on the balance of the game. We won in our game, but only because the cylon players were being good sports, otherwise we wouldn't have had a chance. I doubt that with competitive players playing the cylons the humans really con make it. 

Finally, the Italian edition of the game is a monument to what you should not do in the business. Give Editrice Giochi the edition of any game! The map has typos and outright mistakes, the cards have mistakes. It looks more like a playtest game with all the editing in progress still there, instead of a finished game!

Overall I wasn't impressed.

Gets a good rating because it's the only thematic game my wife will play and she loves it. While I can already see limitations in the choices available to players this is a hugely enjoyable social game that has brought a number of old gaming friends back to our table and hungry for more and we've had some very tense and exciting games. It's a great favourite that's seeing a lot of play.

I have only played the game once, but I was noticeably swept away by it. 4 hours went in the blink of an eye. Even though we lost to the Cylon traitor, I can't help but look back fondly on the experience. The pieces are beautiful, the theme is perfect, and the mechanics make sure that everyone is continually guessing who the Cylon is (even though our Cylon was obvious about it...we didn't want to get him any more angry at us). Definitely want to add a copy to my collection, but there aren't enough people in my group who would be interested in playing.

Arguably our group's favourite game. Lots of downtime, and somewhat difficult for brand new players to get into, but with five experienced players this is a blast.

The best adaptation of any screen (large or small) story to a board game that I have ever experienced.

It masterfully recreates the looming tension of the series in a 3+ hour game between players. I will never forget the first time I played trying to convince (truthfully) my fellow players that I was not a Cylon (ironically, my character was Boomer). The witch hunt nearly killed me.

In the second half of the game, I found myself accusing another player of being a Cylon with such vigor that I used Boomer's miracle token (we were playing with all expansions) to airlock/space Adama. I was convinced he was a Cylon.

Nope.

What I did have, though, was blood on my virtual hands, and the irony of that in contrast to my tearful pleas for mercy in the first half sold me on this game as a concept.

Are you a Cylon?  Am I a Cylon?  Half way through this game you'll think you know who the Cylon is, and then another set of traitor cards will be dealt out and your confidence goes right out the window with it.  Sometimes you'll run out of fuel and lose, sometimes you'll run out of morale and lose and sometimes you'll lose all your population and lose.  If you're really lucky you'll have a massive space battle and the Galactica will be blown up.  Sometimes, you'll even manage to win - but probably only because you were a Cylon.  All this means that on the rare occasion you do win as a loyal human it's a special day.

For straight-up co-op play, there's Pandemic and Lord of the Rings. Honestly, I don't think any game will replace Lord of the Rings in my affections.

But Battlestar Galactica isn't straight-up co-op play. And I *love* it. Paranoia, tension, treachery, massive dogfights against insurmountable odds...it's wonderful!

My only concern is that BSG can take too long, which makes it more of an "event" game and less of a "hey, wanna play BSG?"

RATING: 10
Had a very fun first play as Starbuck.  I didn't get out into space as often as would be thematic, but I think that was more due to the lay of the cards

My cylon compatriot had no idea I was a cylon and used his power to send me to the sickbay.  I would have more sense to send the President, but he must have thought he was the other cylon.  Galactica had 4 damage at this point and I was about to reveal and damage 2 more areas (special ability), and blow up the ship!  D'oh!  I guess that means I was playing "human" pretty well and just waiting for the right time to do my sabotage.  Unfortunately, my team bungled it up and nixed my ability.  It was still good fun.  The humans were having too easy a time of it until the end.  It didn't become a nail biter until then.  I'm looking forward to trying it again.

RATING: 6
This is a coop game that makes you hate everyone you're playing with. The game is nicely designed and balanced, but the atmosphere is oppresive and eventually the players are paralyzed by how difficult it is to pass the endless series of skill checks. Regardless of whether the cylons win or lose (again, it's well balanced), the game starts well and ends with a big groan. Definitely needs 5+ players.

I really enjoyed this.  It has everything I like about Shadows Over Camelot, except the theme is much more interesting and intense, and is better integrated.  Instead of fighting the black knight in a tournament or worrying about a despair card coming out, you're fighting enemy ships and trying to prevent your people from starving.

I was only able to play half a game, but what I saw was very interesting. It's very similar to Shadows Over Camelot (which is not necessarily a good thing). I love the show, so the theme made a big difference to me. I don't think it would be as fun for someone who is not a fan, but I could be wrong. Need a full play to give a solid rating, but starting at 7.

UPDATE: After another play (sadly aborted before the end), I still like it. It seemed overly complex and took way too long, but I think both of those aspects would be reduced by more familiarity with the game. Staying at 7 for now.

Loving this so far, but definitely with 5 rather than 6. Downtime with 6 seems a bit too much (particularly for revealed cylon players, who have a relatively short turn) and if there is a 3rd cylon it seems a bit too difficult for the humans.

With 5 it seems tense and a close game, although I imagine it is dependent on who you are playing with. If there is a lot of talk about who is a cylon that is where the fun is. Otherwise I can imagine it reverts to a normal cooperative game with one or two players dominating the decisions.

I usually am not that interested in hidden role games, but I love this game anyway. The mechanics are all fairly simple and intuitive yet there's tons going on, near-constant decision making, and lots of ways to play. Every playthrough is a different story and will have heroes, villains and unfortunate victims. Downsides: it can be tough to get on the table, it may start some arguments and/or hurt feelings, and the sympathizer rule is atrocious, but none of those problems are big enough for me to bump it down from a 10.

Goes on a little long for what it is... the many skill checks involved, as important as they are at times, can kind of make it drag.  But that notwithstanding, this is a terrific game.  Some will prefer Shadows Over Camelot for its relative simplicity, and I still like Shadows quite a lot for what it is, but this has a lot more "chrome" and doesn't just tack it on, it's all integral to the theme and the gameplay.  There are a lot of great decisions to make throughout the game, and a lot of important interaction and interpersonal dynamics.  Some games can be kind of boring if enough Cylon Attack cards don't come out at times that matter, but some of the great games are truly intense, so I'm happy that this swings for the fences and often hits home runs, even if it strikes out now and then.

What to say, brilliant, intriguing...I love it.

Usually if mine play group play something during the week and the next day is a working day we call it a night at round midnight. when I first got the game we finished our first game at about half past midnight and people were all standing up from their chairs. Once it was finished we all looked at each other, looked at the clock and everyone agreed "well we will all be really tired tomorrow at work because we are going to play another game now!"

In mine opinion it gets a bit old after couple of plays but luckily there are 2 large expansions in witch you can mix and match deferent expansion options so it will keep you hanging on for quite a while.

Enjoy

For a "gaming experience" it's hard to top this one.  It captures the theme of the show really well and the tension is high.

Unfortunately it takes a long time to play and you don't have very much control.  There's also luck, luck luck in here so go in with the right expectations.  Thinking of this as a social game is probably the right way to go.

Played a few times now and the cylons always seem to win.  Not sure whats going on.  Again, the long playtime makes it pretty challenging to get this one to the table.

Ok, so a geekbuddy asked why I had played it so much and not had made a comment on the game yet.

Well, what more needs to say.  Everyone loves it.  I'm just not sure it's a 'Top 20' game.  Heck, I'm not even sure it's a Top 100 or even 200 game.  It's fun, but I'm not sure it's enduring.

It's a bit long for a 'blind bidding' game.  But, the player interaction within that bidding game is interesting.

I do think it's somewhat well balanced.  I enjoy the Sympathizer mechanism.

The main positive is that it's fairly easy to teach and it's well received even among players that aren't fans of the show.

I'm still not sure about this game as far as a 'top notch' game, but with over 50 logged plays now I still enjoy playing it 'most' the time.  It really shines with the right crew.

I did not enjoy the addition of Pegasus, but Exodus has reinvigorated it.

Ez kérem ki van találva
Az eddig próbált árulós-kooperatív játékok közül a legjobb! Mindenképpen érdemes a sorozatot is megnézni, mert így a játékélmény még jobb, de az azt nem ismerők is belevághatnak (sokat segít ezen, ha a szabálymagyarázás közben a sorozatot ismerő pár színesítő infót bedob).
A szabályokat könnyen el lehet sajátítani, azonban minél többet játszottál már vele, annál jobb az élmény. Minél tapasztaltabbak a humánok és a cylonok, annál jobb lesz játszani és újra elő-elővenni. Bár lassan 10 éves a játék, nem sikerült a témát és a mechanizmust jobban kidolgozni. Egyelőre klasszikusnak tűnik! Próbáld ki, ha tudod!

RATING: 4
Always played with expansion and 6 players. Board looks great. Only a few players (the president for example) get to do anything in this game, the rest of the time, you are shuffling some cards and let people who know the game choose actions for you. 
Very very long and tedious. In short, not fun. If it played under an hour, maybe it would be fun. As it is, you need a really good group of friends to play this. Not a pick up and play game.

RATING: 7.2
I'm not sure my gaming group has quite figured out the minutia of weeding out the Cylon players, but we still have a blast with accusations.  First timers really slow this game down and DON'T LET THEM BE PRESIDENT!  Also, the game is more fun when Cylon attacks are frequent; they makes you cherish the jumps that much more :)

I started watching the series shortly before playing this game and found that thematically, this game is excellent. The game was quite difficult for the human players, but even in defeat it felt good to be one of the good guys - this game definitely has the potential to make you temporarily hate your friends. Overall, the game is quite fun, although it seems to be unbalanced. In all games I played where humans won, the card draws were stacked in their favor. Additionally, in 3 and 5 player games it becomes almost unfair for humans, while in a 4 player game the cylon player usually has slightly less than even odds against the humans. I have not yet played a game with more than 5 people.

Rubric:
*Components (1-5) - 4 (Cardboard battlestars could easily have been plastic)
*Artwork (1-5) - 4 (Screenshots from the show are thematic but original artwork for ships and backgrounds are not fluid in transition)
*Intuitiveness & Replay-ability (1-10) - 9 (Player phases are simple and straightforward. There is a learning curve for new players so I would not immediately teach this as a gateway game.)
*Strategy & Choices (1-10) - 7 (Much of the strategy is decided before the game begins based on character choice of the group. If a key member of the group becomes a Cylon, your choices become limited and tip in the favor of the Cylon player(s). There is an element of luck as you handle crisis and jump cards but hopefully you trust your team to support you)
*Game Experience (1-10) - 8 (Fun every time it hits the table. I have played as Human and Cylon and Cylon Leader characters. I have used none, one and both expansions. I would highly recommend Pegasus over Exodus. Some turns drag, as each player preforms their actions while the others wait. That said, everyone has a change to contribute to the crisis on every turn so you are still actively contributing to the game on each turn.)
*Elegance (1-10) - 8 (This game has been flushed out and simplified for players. Unfortunately one expansion had much more playtesting than the other.)

Very clever mechanics and "paranoia" type of game. I like the many options the players have. For a first timer, it can be VERY daunting and fiddly to remember all the rules and abilities, specially with all the expansions in place.

Juegazo que tiene un poco de todo: intriga politica, combate cooperativo (o mas bien semi-cooperativo, jejej) contra el enemigo en pos de un objetivo comun, y gestion (mas que obtencion) de recursos. ambientacion tematica excelente y si has visto la serie aun mejor. 

de hecho el principal defecto que se puede achacar al juego, es que como lo juegues sin haber visto la serie, te la espoilea pero a lo bestia. y como sea el juego expandido, mas aun. 

Top5 y dificilmente superable, en mi opinion.

RATING: 4
It is some fun, I'll grant it that--and the play of skill cards does lead to some interest for the Cylon saboteur and for the humans trying to deduce the identity of the traitor. That having been said, it's too long, there's not much for a revealed Cylon to do, the sympathizer is cool in theory but wonky in practice, and too much hinges on those silly executive order cards. Standard FFG mixed bag of interesting ideas and failed execution.

RATING: 7.5
The theme was great in this game, even though I have only seen bits of a couple episodes of the show. There was definitely some fun interaction with other players and there was some nice moments of tension. Seems like tons of replayability available. 

Parts of what kept my rating from being higher is that it was a very long game (4+ hours) but that was due to 6 players and only 1 had played the game before. So there was time to explain the rules initially and then us noobs took a while for turns. Then there was the length of time between turns and then when it comes to your turn, it was not eventful. I guess that's part of the game where there's a lull and then a lot goes on.

RATING: 3
Having thought the TV show poorly acted and grossly overrated, I held out little hope for the game. It's certainly better than I expected, but with some major flaws. First, everyone needs to get into it on a role-playing level to make it fun. And even if they do, it is overly long and loses a lot once you know who the bad guys are. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I'm a little bit turned off by some of the fiddlyness of the mechanics, but the traitor mechanic is done so well that it outshines most of the smaller flaws.

Update: Having played it a little bit more, it feels like, although some games are won by a well played cylon, most cylon victories come from too many cylon fleets coming in a row

Joc semicooperatiu de rols ocults que reflexa perfectament l'esperit de la serie. Amb les expansions (la nau de Pegasus i la Flota Cylon) guanya moltíssim.

El nombre ideal de jugadors és de 5 per evitar el "simpatizante".

Actualizació després de més partides: imprescindible, cada cop que jugo m'agrada més, i és el joc més emocionant que he provat. Amb l'última expansió es pot jugar a 6 sense que quedi descompensat fent servir l'objectiu de la Terra i el rol de amotinado.

This is a good game. played it and really enjoyed it. I feel though that it was the co-operative traitor mechanic that I enjoyed and not so much the game itself. I would rather play shadows over camelot than this.

If you like the program add 2 to my score making it an 8. I've never seen the show, this game is full of Battlestar theme so did nothing for me.

The traitor mechanic is the interesting part of the game. Everything else is a means to that end, and what dull and uninspiring means they are. Play coloured cards until it is your turn again, then make a single choice, and draw some more coloured cards to play. Uninspiring but servicable. Far too much text. Skill cards are too small.

J'adore ce jeu. C'est un peu long. Mais chaque joueur est impliqué à tous les tours que ce soit via des tests de compétences qui exigent leur vote, que ce soit via les ordres promulgués par un autre joueur et l'atmosphère de traîtrise autour de la table devient véritablement stimulante. Le jeu a un thème très fort également. Les alliances entre joueurs, les discussions, tout ça rend le jeu vraiment intéressant.

Consensus among my playgroup is that the game itself should never get more than 6-7 on the merits of how good it is in vacuum. It's just that with a good group the playing is so much fun, it would really make no sense giving anything less than 9 to this masterpiece! The tabletalk is exquisite and blaming others has never been as rewarding and invigorating. It doesn't matter if you know anything about the TV series, but if you do, it will give you some extra kicks. The mechanics fit the show better than I could have ever guessed.

RATING: 10
Excellent cooperative game.  Best traitor mechanism I've ever seen.  Kicks the ass off of ghost stories and other recent cooperative games.  Reminds me of Arkham, but the system is stripped down and you have the cylons to worry about instead- which makes for a shorter, simpler, but more fun game.  Your individual turn/action is usually not that interesting but the long term group planning (we need to get some pilots out, you should take engineering skills because I think our engineer is a cylon, etc.) is pretty interesting.  The guess the traitor metagame is fantastic.  The ship combat is simple but provides some tension.  The skill resolution, which is a sort of hidden bidding mechanism, is really clever.  The variable player power characters are very different and playing each one will be a totally new experience.  The components are great, rules were well written with the exception of one typo (nukes).  It needed a player aid with the battle chart, but its on the back of the rules.

Overall this is a fantastic co-op game that FF thankfully didn't overchrome.  The theme is great and shines through the entire game, but you don't get bogged down in rules exceptions and card text.  

UPDATE: climbing my ratings, this is great fun and very replayable.  The humans really have to have their shit together to win, especially if the president or admiral become cylons.  

UPDATE: Humans have won!  Awesome game, its a different ride every time.  Sometimes its easier for the humans, sometimes for the cylons, but you always have a great story to tell after the game.

The balance is really effected by the players themselves.  Our group seems to have caught on to the cylon strategies easily but we aren't the most effective humans.  We may start turning the resource dials up until the humans start winning more often.  GREAT GAME.  This is one of my favorite games of all time, ranking up there with Titan.

RATING: 7.25
Hard to rate this game: I like the tv-series (as entertainment), and the game replicates quite well the overall feeling and dynamics of the series. That is definitely a positive thing in a game based on a television series.

The gameplay itself is not actually bad per se, but little bit uninspired combination of communal skill checks, light hand management and some suspension from figuring out identities of the cylon agents.

If you like the series, playing this few times is probably a positive experience. But not a very good game mechanismwise in my book, and probably not replay value for 10+ games.

RATING: 6
It was fun, but awfully long. I don't see a very good way to shorten it either. I think you'll just have to play a different hidden role negotiation type game if you don't have the 3+ hours. The characters work well to feel very different from each other, but the general mechanics of the game aren't anything special. The real fun is in the paranoia. Because it's so dependent on the players being deceptive to work, there's really no reason you couldn't just play another (shorter) game with similar mechanics. Even so, it does create some good “remember that one time” stories, which I think is why the Ameritrash crowd finds it so appealing.
UPDATE: Now that The Resistance has come out, providing a structured hidden traitor experience in such a short time, there really isn't much reason to pull this one out other than the theme. Battlestar Galactica now feels to me like playing a game of The Resistance and Pandemic at the same time, but going on much longer. I wish the designers had realized that the real strength of this game lies in the deception and analysis of the actions the other players take, not in managing the food, fuel, and population dials. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
In theory quite a good game. The problem is the swingy nature of the crisis cards. The fact that a three to four hour long game that usually hinges on paranoia and player interaction can essentially win itself (in both ways) is hard to stomach. Yeah, 75 percents of the games you play might be perfectly fine. But for me, usually it is too much of a time investment to risk getting into one of the other 25 percents.

Giving this an 8, although I need to play more to solidify. It seems like the experience could change drastically based on WHO you play it with and their mood at the time.

Definitely tension on if there is a Cylon. There seems like different decisions on how to deal with threats in the best way. I like how the different characters have different roles based on the cards they get and that there are a lot to choose from.

It seemed like there were down times when we didn't have a threat and we weren't really sure what to do while we waited for ships to show up. And the threats didn't seem all that intimidating. 

Again I need to get more plays in to get a better idea.

Definitely takes a long time to play, and as others said at the table, the experience we got from it could have probably been gotten in a lot less time than it took.

Great abstraction of the theme of the show.  Character abilities are great.  The mechanisms all work very well together.

Really interesting mechanics. Haven't played it enough to get full use out of the expansion, but it's neat.

What is really great about this game is that everybody does indeed suspect everybody else of being a Cylon. Accusations flying back and forth, and skill checks being sabotaged not because the Cylon actually does something, but because the others refuse to cooperate with who they think is a Cylon.

It's all in the metagame, and this game enables that perfectly.

RATING: 9
BSG can be fiddly and clunky. It doesn't always satisfy. But when it [i]does[/i] work it is very hard to beat. In those high moments, following comment applies: BSG is a game of mind games. Cylons sabotage the humans not only be being unhelpful, but also by persuading them to make less than helpful moves when the pressure is high and mistakes are costly. Humans need to keep focused on doing the best thing to survive, figure out fast who the cylons are, and deflect suspicion and criticism more effectively than the cylons do. All this adds up to a diffcult metagame that offers many avenues for misdirection and for manipulating ambiguity.  

But BSG is a fragile game. People need to be prepared for the possibility that they will be subjected to a one-sidedly brutal defeat. I've decided, furthermore, that I don't like the game if I play with people who don't pay attention. In that context the game drags, the intensity lessens, and a 3-hour game drags into a 5-6 hour bleary-eyed ordeal. 
 
EXPANSIONS:
I don't play regularly enough to keep on top of all the extra rules added by the expansions. In general, I find the expansions add more overhead and complications with little payoff in terms of gameplay. But there are one or two cool things that I'll want to keep. To avoid the bloat, next time I'm going to: 

-From Pegasus, ditch 'reckless' skill cards (except I'll keep the Investigative Committee)

-From Pegasus, ditch any quorum, super crisis, you are a cylon cards that refer to treachery

-From Exodus, ditch crisis cards and skill cards with 'consequence' symbol.

-Keep cylon fleet board, pegasus cylon locations, pegasus board, but ditch all other expansion features (new caprica, conflicted loyalties, cylon leaders, etc)

NOTE ABOUT PLAYS:

My plays for the Pegasus and Exodus expansion are rolled into my stats for the BSG base game.

Good theme and a few very good ideas; the dormant cylon idea is cleanly implemented.  As usual for FFG, the components are nice.
But unfortunately the game is slow, fiddly, repetitive and boring. And lasts too long for what happens on the table.
Played again recently. The game itself did not deliver.  There should be an incentive to remain cylon; otherwise the game is boring.  Less so with "fun" people of course, but with the right crowd, any game can be fun; this does not make the game itself good.

edit: no no no.  This game lacks the paranoïa of the show, feels too random.  SOmetimes it jujst drags, nothing happens.  I really want to like this game, but I can't.

RATING: 8.5
Get ready to be immersed in this theme heavy coop game where you are sure at least one of your shipmates is a Cylon!

It is a risk and resource management game, which is fairly easy to play, and where the action takes place during the Crisis Resolution step at the tail end of every player's turn.  Most of the time, players will get to "vote" (using their action cards) on the crisis at hand.

WARNING: As with most games, it can be quite boring when played with the wrong type of players.  Even more so with this one.  Table talk is a large part of the game, so if you don't like Co-Op games or dislike the theme, stay away.

Following a jump, there will be a few duller moments.  This is the time when you will want to pick up additional cards or use Recon Patrol to help with the next jump or ensure nothing really nasty is waiting for you with the next Crisis card.

NEGATIVE ASPECT: Can be long if you're not into this type of game or dislike the theme.

The Skill cards are too small (standard sized cards would have been better, IMHO)

A die would have been better when rolling to damage the Galactica (location) and/or Cylon BaseStar, instead of having to shuffle a pile of tokens.

Despite the large manual, the game is quite easy to pick up.

The game definitely recreates some of the atmosphere of the show (or at least the atmosphere of watching the show). Ingeniously, you may know or have a strong idea of who the Cylon may be, but you won't be able to prove it until they reveal themselves, or you break the rules. 

Even if you are allowed to look a the cards, you cannot show anybody - thus you may have the proof you need, but nobody may believe you!

Unfortunately, once the Cylon is revealed, a lot of the tension is dispelled, and it turns into a roll-the-dice-and-move kind of game, though using "jump" icons on cards, instead of pips on a die. And the skill cards, are very limiting, I'm not sure if this improves with the expansions, but I was definitely fed up of some of them by the end.

The more people you can get to play the better I'd imagine, though our first 4 3 player game lasted 4 hours, so beware.

I only play a house-ruled shortened version. Distance 4, lower ressources, less vipers/raptors/nukes, halve the deck etc. And it works like a charm.
I can send you the exact configuration if you pm me. 

Then you have a tense 100 minute game that is perfect. (Otherwise it drags on for just too long!)

This game is theme through & through.. if you're a human you really wanna protect the galactica, if you're a cylon you really wanna destroy it.
The traitor mechanic is implemented perfectly.. it builds a tension of doubt and mistrust, but at the same time you have to work together.. these naging doubts & accusations.. a true classic!

I have played it twice and it didn't stink any worse the second time compared to the first. I didn't like the new tv series and after watching the first series I gave up as it was just plain dull. (don't get me started).

So to sum it up, if you don't give a rats about the characters or the new series then you won't give a rats about this game. 

The mechanics are simple and do the job but the experience requires you to engage with the theme. 

I didn't.

If you rethemed it as mice trying to escape a sewer while being attacked by rats or something that might be interesting and bump it to a 6 or 7.  

Before you buy check the theme out,

I was never a fan of the show and I hate the pressure of being a cylon.  If you are a cylon then you have to know when the best time to reveal yourself is.  This game is also longer than I would like.

One of the best games I've ever played. With an easy learning curve, there's actually not much depth to the game. I like games with a lot of depth, but the fun is not found in the depth, it's found in the social aspect of the game. Accusing people is what I do! Played it twice and bought it today.

Updating my rating from an 8 to a 9.  Since my previous comment where I had not yet been a Cylon, I've had a few more plays of this game.

I still have similar complaints.  Among them, is the time it takes to play the game, the difficulty of learning to get new players to try it, and that ultimately you are pushing skill cards around for a few hours.

The brilliance shines through the interaction though.  The constant fear of backstabbing, challenged motives, card analysis, and risk taking has a great balance.  Definitely helps that the group I play it with knows each other fairly well so the table talk is a lot of fun.  Only one game has truly been sour - where the Cylons had us held in the brig indefinitely until we called it a wash after they were done torturing us.  The rest have been enjoyable to play through, if not easy.

That's my final complaint.  If the cylon(s) are new players who don't really know how to utilize their options, the game might turn out pretty biased to the humans' favor.  The right balance of player skill can mar the experience a little if not found.

My first game saw President Tom Zarek begin his press conference with those immortal words, "I come to you today with an important message. I am a Cylon."

Before he was gunned down he managed to say, "I have hidden several bombs aboard Galactica, surrender now and your lives will be spared."

A little while later Galactica blew up surrounded by a swarm of Cylon raiders!

LATER: Interesting and fun game. Unfortunately, "Daybreak" the series finale left such a sour taste in my mouth that I now avoid all things BSG.

Sold.

This is an amazing game when played with the right set of people. If your group is not social enough, or doesn't have the right mindset, then this can be really boring and feeling generic. You should also have some house rules. If you're discovered as a cyclon early on or if you have 2-3 major attack cards at the beginning, then start over again.

OK,  I played this, and now understand the hype.  It was very enjoyable, even though half the group were experienced.  I ended up being human (even though I was Starbuck) and had pretty much nailed one cylon.  Not the other!

It was quite involved and engaging, and this is from someone who has not seen the recent series.  (I am old enough to remember when the original series was "new", but not necessarily memorable.)  I have also now enjoyed following some Play-by BB on BGG.

This is Fantasy Flight's latest take of co-op games. The end result is typical FF fare: Take a simple game that would work rather well, and add complexity to it until it takes over two hours, has bunch of little decks that add little to the game, and ends up being a prime example of how to over-design a game.

There's a good game underneath all of this, but I won't subject myself to the piles of dung that surround it.

A very thematic ameritrash semi-coop.  A lot of downtime (ex : you draw your cards at the beginning of your turn so no way to plan your turn ahead of time) and a lot of board maintenance (managing cylons).  Takes too long to play for the amount of luck involved.

Deeply immersive theme that is faithful to the series in terms of suspense and suspicion. However, like most cooperative games I've played so far, this game drags with a bunch of newbies to four hours with six players, despite the very limited set of actions a player can take: "Move your token, and take an action--play a card or do what the space says to do." And the actions themselves are too simple for my tastes--Starbuck: roll a 4+ on d8 to destroy a Cylon Raider in combat; if you get hit, you end up in Sick Bay; rinse and repeat. As Baltar, I was thrown into the Brig, and could not get out for the lack of cards--I kept on playing one card on my turn, what fun is that? Near the end of the game, the pace picked up, and the humans lost by 2 points in the skill check cards to prevent our last morale point disappearing before we could make the final jump to Earth. Still, slow play like this is unforgivable. I'm not sure when I will play this again. Initial rating: '6'.

Update (06/18/10): Haven't played it since. Don't think I ever will again. Downing to '5'.

Update (08/17/10): In hindsight, the reason this is probably so popular is that it provides a very good template for role-playing, and in that regard succeeds; as a game of in itself, meh.

Update (10/01/11): I am a big fan of the new BSG series, as well as the old one. Still, familiarity is not enough to have me consciously want to play this cardboard-bloated, mind-numbing time waster. Due to the cooperative nature, some alpha-male will always take over the game, although the secret Cylon element should keep it interesting. I now feel about this game like I feel about Arkham Horror. I simply don't care to play this ever again. Down to '2'.

Update (10/30/2014): Played [thing=159503][/thing], which is faster, more intense, and more fluid than BSG:TBG. With tongue-in-cheek references to Star Trek, TCID is a [i]far superior[/i]--in terms of game mechanics--more accessible cooperative that plays in 60-75 minutes.

RATING: 8
I'm very torn on this game. On the one hand it has given me some of my favorite gaming memories. On the other, there are times where I have never been more bored playing a game.

In essence BSG is a complicated game of Mafia -- it's a team play game with "moles" who are trying to sabotage the players' success. It's up to the "good" players to figure out who the moles are and convince others around the table to agree with them and take the moles out. As such, the fun level of this game is HIGHLY dependent on who you play with. The psychological aspect and bantering is what makes this game fun, so if you don't have people who can do that, don't bother playing it. Furthermore, the game is really only fun if there are two Cylons (moles), so don't bother playing if you don't have 5 or 6 players (this can make it hard to find people to play). 

The interesting thing with this game is how quickly the pace can change. Many turns can go by where you're basically sitting there not doing much, and then all of a sudden a Cylon fleet will jump in and all hell will break loose. This can make for uneven (and sometimes boring) gameplay, but I think it's an essential part of this game. This unevenness captures the feeling of the show better than any other branded game I've played. It really does make you feel like you're a sad bunch of humans wandering through space. 

At the price for this game you would expect a nice board and some nice pieces. Well, they're definitely "good enough", but not exceptional.

So in summary: this game captures the feeling of show VERY well. It's also given me some of my best gaming memories. For these reasons I give it the 8 that I did. However, if you have a crappy group of friends, I can see this game feeling like a 2.

Four plays in (well, really, 3+, as one game wasn't finished due to time constraints,) and I think this game is excellent.  The cylons have won every time, but the latest play was one jump away from a human victory.

This game is tense, exciting, and because there are several roles to choose, and so many different actions to take, replayability seems very high.

I'm looking forward to the next time it hits the table, and would recommend it very highly to people asking about it.

Preliminary rating after a single 4p game.  I don't believe the potential was fully realized with this one play, and have doubts about the game with only four.  Current rating based on projected potential.  I have high hopes, but we'll see...

[q="HiveGod"]Some games require you to bring more to the table than others—the best games are far more than the sum of their parts, and contain possibilities that are not spelled out in the rulebook, or even hinted at.  They must be invented by the players.  "Experience" games, especially, demand much of the players.  [i]BSG[/i] is guilty of this in spades.  It's intimately tied to the show, requiring that you watched it, liked it, and are willing to engage in role-playing the paranoia and terror of tooth-and-nail survival and religious genocide.  The rules and mechanics serve merely as a foundation for this play—dumping cards into a skill check is boring.  Paying attention to who is dumping cards and how many, who is abstaining and why, demanding explanations for a player's behavior during that check [i]is[/i] the game.  That's where facial expressions, body language, and too-passionate denials trip up the wolves and damn the innocent.

The mechanics of [i]BSG[/i] are not, in and of themselves, sufficiently interesting to entertain for more than 15 minutes.  They are indeed "boring, fiddly and repetitive".  But as a foundation to support the emergent play of like minds, it's pretty damn fantastic.

So...  is [i]BSG[/i] a good game?  It all depends on who you have to play it with.[/q]
UPDATE:  After a 6p game, this locks in at a solid 8.  The mechanical aspects of what's happening [i]on[/i] the table are nothing compared to what's happening [i]at[/i] the table.  If you sit down to this game thinking you'll be playing out tactical space battles and puzzling to solve sci-fi crises co-op style, you'll be bitterly disappointed.  Oh, sure, you'll be doing those things in a small way—but really, they are only there so you can watch how enthusiastically and competently (or not) people work to handle them...  The real game lies in the social interaction of wolves slinking among sheep while bleating helplessly.  It's all about poker faces, plausible deniability and hiding in plain sight.  It's playing on emotions, constructing compelling arguments, and working at the chinks in others'.  It's pure sociopolitics, more RPG than board game—it's [i]Werewolf[/i] with a sci-fi theme and more moving parts.

PS.  With the right people, it's a hoot!

UP-UPDATE:  Bumping this up to a well-deserved 9.  Now that we have the rules down to the point where the mechanics fade into the background, [i]BSG[/i]'s true potential shines through.  An incredible experience!

After several plays (including an AMAZING pbf session), I have to actually enter comments on this awesome game.  BSG can be a very tense and exciting game.  I have only had one session that was a little dry, and that was when it was being played as a 2 player game using an official variant.  If BSG has a flaw, it is that it is at its best the more people that play it.  A 3 player game is good.  4 is better.  5 or 6 is outstanding!  I don't have an issue with the Sympathizer as some folks do, although, it would irritate me if my group wanted to "game" the system in order to cope with the Sympathizer by intentionally knocking a resource into the red pre-sleeper phase.  Even people that I introduced the game to who have not seen the show have loved it.  It truly transcends the typical "licensing tie-in" genre and shines as an outstanding example of paranoia and distrust made fun!

Spend a long time doing very little.

Whenever I play this game it takes forever - I usually play in a large group of 6 or more people.

The game is too long, you could start the humans right before the half-way mark when the psilon sympathizers have to pick sides.  Otherwise you spend a long time getting there and not much happens.  When all the psilons leave the ship and try to destroy you is when it gets interesting (although usually hopeless for the humans).

The exciting and fun game elements seems to be buried in a lot of trivial non-sense.  The president of the colony has cards that are marginally helpful and they waste time reading them but often never use them.

There needs to be a third type of player (not sympathizer) but a psilon that is trying to remain with the humans and help them win.

If you could play this game in 30 minutes, 45 max I would have given it a 6 or 7, considering it takes 2 or more hours to get the 30-45 minutes of fun makes this game one I don't plan on playing again.

Fantasy Flight continues to have extremely high quality boards, cards, and production values overall.  Fantasy Flight also keeps true to its form over substance game offerings.  They like to sell a lot of pretty games, but not really good games.  I wonder if they refuse to make any game that doesn't have the option for expansions.

A well designed Euro-style game can't be expanded over and over again, FF wants to put out new content for a game every quarter or put it out of print.

I have had some great times playing this game. Like many traitor-mechanic games, the experience is pretty variable.

It must be said that i enjoy shouting at people though.

Joined a 6 player game which took 3,5 hours. A lot of downtime and slow progression in the game. I'm not a fan of cooperational games, but this game could not change my opinion.The suspection was in this play greater than willing to win. Result was actually less cooperation and the damages increased (slowly). 
However when you are a fan of shadows over camelot and maybe also pandamic, or a great Galacticafan, this could be a game for you. For a europlayer like me, this game was a space too far.
Points for layout, material, ok rules, and possibility to give some players a wondefull night.

The actual mechanics are pretty weak: the whole point of the game is the meta-game about the traitor. This also means that the game is pretty long because there is a lot of discussing and table-talk. It would be twice as good if it were an hour shorter.

I generally prefer shorter games but tolerated BSG better than most long games that I've tried. Even though your in-character actions can be limited you are always involved in discussions of general strategy and Cylon detection.

Love this game, but will admit that it runs a little bit long.  Some of my favorite gaming memories were made playing this game.  Unfortunately, it almost never gets to the table because the group isn't quite big enough (I think 5 is perfect....4 is do-able but 5 is much better) or the group wants to play something else.  Tried one of the expansions (Daybreak) but tend to prefer the core game alone. Wish that the little upgrades in the expansions (like cylon minis) were included in the base game.

This a difficult and lengthy cooperative game which isn't a necessarily a negative in itself. But mix grinding elements with surefire traitors and the result is a draining 3+ hours experience. Unlike other cooperative games, there is no way to improve the situation. Every turn is weathering crisis after crisis and hoping the 'jump' clock will bloody advance. After a few hours of play, Galactica will be in poor shape, limping into the next jump before running out of suppliers / morale / what-not.

There is no way to grow in strength, move the clock forward or tip the scales. Just another "Kill me now" groan for every new crisis without a jump clock. Towards the end, the morale dial becomes misleading because the players on the human side actually lost the will to live several turns ago.

Paranoia. As the humans, you feel it.  As the Cylon(s), you create it.  While everyone seems to be rushing about from location to location, trying to help, there is at least one person who is secretly sabotaging your efforts and driving wedges in between players.  Skill checks are made by playing cards face down that are either negative or positive, then shuffled together with 2 random "fate" cards thrown in to ensure anonymity.  Meanwhile, raiders attack, boarders move up, and resources dwindle while someone aboard contemplates the perfect moment to reveal themselves and seal the fate of the ship.

This game plays much better at 3 and 5 players that any other number and it is really fun when we are under attack by the cylon forces but once we jump away resolving crisis cards can become boring if that's all you manage to draw for a while. Perhaps my group can't role play enough to give this game enough "content beyond whats in the box" to be played often.

Co-op games with traitors aren't really my thing although I do feel like playing this every now & then with the right group.  It's a good way to spend time with friends.

Things I like: 

* The way traitors sabotage with wrong coloured cards in the skill checks.  I think it's a good mechanic.
* How additional loyalty cards are received halfway through the game.  It freshens the game up when it might otherwise start to drag.
* The multiple variable player powers.
* The social/psychological aspect of the traitor(s) can be great with the right group.  It's great fun to find out how & why players played the way they did.

Things I don't like: 

* I don't like being a traitor (I'm happy to be evil but this type of duplicity is against my nature).  
* The order the crisis cards arrive is a bit too random for me - it's hard to plan for them & it can be boring when there are no enemy ships for long periods.
* Occasionally there's not much to do on your turn & the game loses a bit of tension.

This has become the game my group talks about the most. The intense paranoia and the need for cylons to be subtle in their subversive actions makes for a great (and very different) story after each play that will get talked about time and again. Like the time we elected the chief president. Twice. And he was a frakkin' cylon the whole time!

I was Starbuck and about a third of the way through Carl decided Oliver was a Cylon and sent him to the brig where he stayed. Jarratt sent Carl to the brig. They both protested their innocence. Later it became obvious that Oliver and Phil were the Cylons and Oliver declared followed later by Phil. The final turns were a bit of an anticlimax as we jumped to escape a mass of Cylons and had an easy cruise to human victory
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Co-ops won't ever be my favourite type of game, but this is above average for the genre. As with Shadows over Camelot it's the dark atmosphere produced by the constant suspicion of a traitor that makes the game, although Cylons are perhaps a bit too easy for the President to reveal. Variable pacing, some jumps are just swarming with enemy fighters, others provide little to do but kick your heels for a while. There is some die rolling, but its influence on the game is kept reasonable. In all, this, like SoC is an over-produced 'experience' game, but good for a change of pace.

Frakkin' toasters!

Amazing game that managed to exceed my high expectations. After lots of plays this only gets better. Best theme ever, and the need for co-operation despite the paranoia, accusations, and politics matches the show brilliantly. My favourite game by a long way.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The base game is quite good, and can be very tense. The balance of the game shifts with the number of players, but is overall reasonably well balanced. 

The Pegasus Expansion is good for having access to Pegasus, but the New Caprica board can double the length of this already impressively long game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Superior to Shadows over Camelot because everyone is working on the same thing at the same time, so there is less chance of being sent on some interminable task for the rest of the game. Card mechanic is quite clever.  It does seem like the metagame could have some disadvantages if you always play with the same people--you'd have to play the same way whether you are a Cylon or not. (2 plays)

RATING: 4
The theme fits well, and the component quality is good, although the rulebook could be better and player aids would have been a lot better than having to read small text upside down on the board. However, the much larger problem is the gameplay. There were times when there were no cylon ships, and not really a lot for the human players to do with their actions. This was made all the worse by a distinct lack of variety on the cards, and each player normally only drawing from 2 or 3 of the 5 decks (meaning they saw even less variety). The cylon players also had little of interest to do. Also, I find the idea of changing sides mid-game rather off-putting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The game gives you the best gaming experiences you can possibly get. You are constantly involved. It's a cooperative AND competitive, epic, thrilling game.

Only downside: it's less of a classic euro- boardgame, so that scratch is not itched. But to hell with that, it is just so engaging you will never notice.

The first three Plays were a clear 8. I only played tree-player games yet, and think it might go up to 9 with more players.

The next step from Shadows over Camelot. And different enough from it, to be appealing to Shadows-Haters, as well as Lovers.

I'm a fan of the series. The BSG-Theme is integrated very well, but my fellow players, who do not know the series, are enjoying the Game as much as I am.

Great game. I love games where, even after a day or two, I still talk about a session, and say: "uh, remember that time you were a cylon..." or "that time we were attacked from all sides; but I managed to jump, risking loosing population..." or "I knew you were a cylon after that skill check"... 
A good game experiance is what makes a game stand out, and BSG-the game sure stands out. I look forward to playing more games, with it, and eventually getting the expansion(s).

Buen juego de coop-op con sistema de traidor oculto. Lleva camino de convertirse en un clásico moderno. Puntos fuertes: resolución de crisis (una especie de pujas en subasta oculta con cartas) que es el pilar del juego. Cada personaje es único con puntos fuertes y débiles. El traidor descubierto aún está en el juego pudiendo hacer varias acciones. Pegas: los humanos lo tienen dificil para ganar. Partidas largas (3-4 horas). La suerte influye en varias ocasiones más que tu habilidad para lidiar con una crisis. Me gusta la variedad de cartas que hay y la pacífica quietud del espacio profundo que se forma tras hacer un salto para evitar un ataque cylon.

Great game that is always fun.  I love losing this game just as much as winning it.  Being a human and getting repeatedly screwed over by cylons is a good laugh.  Being a cylon and spreading havoc is great.  Games take a long time, so it doesn't hit the table all that often, but I enjoy playing BSG a few times every year.

Average game. Shadow over Camelot has a similar taste but takes less time playing. Good theme but too much dependent of hand cards in my opinion.

I'm not familiar with the show, and I'm not a huge fan of games where you spend the whole time trying to mindscrew everybody at the table. Overall a very average game that I would play again (and probably enjoy it well enough for the duration), but I wouldn't ever request.

--May 24, 2013--
Played it again. Will no longer play it again. The game itself is minimal. You spend the entire game playing cards from your hand in response to randomly selected crisis cards at the end of each turn. You can do almost nothing on your turn except draw your complement of cards. Nothing happens on the board. Why does the board even exist? Make the game simpler and pare it down to the cards and the mind screw. People who like this game seem to really just want the people-playing factor. Get rid of the rest of the crap that make this game take way too long and be way too boring. Aaaahhghgghgghghhh I'm ranting again. Oops.

In summary. Yuck. Yuckyuckyuck.

Battlestar Galactica is great but long.  After the first play, I though it had "fired" Shadows Over Camelot.  But it took 2 years to get BSG back to the table, while we played SOC a few times over that period.  I wish we had more time for 5 hour games!

RATING: 8
First played September 16th, 2009. It takes about 20 minutes to teach and setp (if at the same time) and about 2 hours to play for a group of 6 players. This has a lot of luck to it and a bit of strategy. The Humans seem at a disavantage. Everyone choses a character and gets 3 resources based on their character. There are 5 types of resources, however each character is limited to the resource types they can get. A president and admiral are declared based on ranking of characters chosen. Then each player takes a turn gathering 5 resources (based on your character) and takes two actions. Actions can be repair damage, fight Cylons, move ship, put someone in the brig, etc. After actions you draw a senerio card and decided what action to take. Senerios typically have two options and both are usually bad. You can lose fuel, food, moral, colonies. Cylon ships and bases appear. Colony ships or fighters also appear. This is a great game for those of you who like co-op games. I don't like the secret Cylons so much however. I recommend you give it a try if you know someone who has it.

Initial rating of 8 but may raise with more plays.  Similar to Shadows over Camelot.

I think that there are more ups and downs in BSG then in Shadows.  Very bad situations can happen early and you may get a lull later in BSG while SoC seems to gradually ramp up.

If you are familiar with the series and enjoy it you will probably like the thematic aspects of the game.

[edit]: after several plays I raised it to a 9.  Very thematic and fun.

One of the best "hidden traitor" games and fits well with the series, although not all player counts are great, and people need to be able to keep a poker face. The main drawback of this game is its extreme length - I never managed to finish a game in less than 3 hours, and it can go on quite a bit longer than that depending on the number of players and how tardy people are.

Love playing this game with a like-minded group of gamers.  5p is the only way to play it.  Tried it with just 4 and the game seemed to lose a lot.  Love throwing around accusations and trying to determine whom the Cylon is.

Update:  Played a 6P no-symp and it was still a great game.  Played a 6p with symp one time and it was brutal.  Felt gamey as I had the choice of destinations and could have made the game go either way (4v2 or 3v3).

I would probably say that it is decent game which may hit the table about three, maybe four times a year, with the ugliest FFG minis ever (if you live in Poland you might find the Raiders strangely similar to crappy plastic soldiers sold in bags in the 90's) if not for the traitor element which makes the game pretty much in-sane! Nothing compares to the paranoia that strikes the players when things are going downhill and everyone really wants to find the Cylon(s) responsible for bringing the fleet ever closer to a definite fall. For that single element: the nights it made us stay up and throw accusations at each other, BSG will always stand tall on my shelf.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

My elevator pitch for BSG is "You've got to play this game! It takes two hours, is intensely stressful, and at the end, you'll hate all of your friends! It's one of my favorite games ever!"
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Jan09: Well, in some ways it's awesome.  The situations are dynamic and the tension is pretty high.  The mechanics match the theme pretty darn well.

But it still takes a long time to play.  A quick loss still took a couple hours, and I just don't see it going a lot quicker.

The rules are a bit of a hurdle to get up and going, however they do make a lot of sense once you play.  I didn't have to look back into the rules too often.

If you're a fan of the show, or a fan of FFG big boxes, I recommend you look into it.

For me, I still actually think I like Lord of the Rings the best of all the coops.  The tension and game length is just right in LotR.

Update: So, I've played BSG twice now. I think I'm pretty much done. In the first game, I won as a Cylon. Why did I win? Because the FTL track got moved back 3 spaces while there were 2 base stars present. Was I responsible for that? Not really.

In the second game I lost as a human. Why did I lose? Because I didn't get somebody out of the brig. Why didn't I? Because it was boomer right after the sleeper phase. I had no information to go on other than a "please let me out". The odds said she was a cylon, so I didn't. Turns out she was a human and we proceeded to fail the next 3 important skill checks because the cylons were running loose. Was that my fault? Not really.

So for me, it's sort of an experience game. I don't really have control over winning or losing. I just go along with it. That's okay for a shorter game, but 3 hours of just sort of going along with what happens is too much for me.

I will say it captures the theme well. There's plenty of distrust and the humans are going to take a beating. However, I already traded off my copy.

Underwhelming game. There are other co-ops that are better. Its high rating is attributable to a good attempt at boardgaming around the theme which is a "geeky TV show".

I am a BSG(reimagining) TV fan.
BSG board game has strong theme, but bad game mechanic.
12 months after I first played BSG, 4 games later and after the TV hype wear off... I am so glad that I didn't buy this game.

With 6 players, it seems to take forever between your turns.

Unless you plays the President or Admiralal, you are just waiting to collect your cards, then been told to chip in # of color card that you have in crisis resolution.

If you are new and happen to be Cylon, the other players (human/unrevealed Cylon) cannot help you, So you are going to waste 2~3 hours on a lossing battle.

There are better games (co-op/spy) available.

Fun co-op game with a traitor mechanic, theme ties in well with the game play. BSG appears to be similar to Shadows over Camelot at first in that it does include the card placement and dice based combat, but it clearly surpasses it with its unique character cards and board location based abilities and the traitor(s) have more options playing either unrevealed or revealed.   Although the luck factor of the cards can affect the game in an unsatisfactory way, the pacing and interaction more than compensates this flaw.

There are just so many reasons why I love this game. Every game is a story, every story is different. The mystery, the intrigue, and wild accusations and the metagameing. Then, once the Cylons are known, the game changes to one of strategy and technical game play. Can both teams get the most out of their limited actions to accomplish their goals!

This is seriously the best game out there.

Don't let the comments deter you, what most people fail to realise is this is a bluffing game - a talent that most groups clearly lack from the explanations about bored cylons who are discovered early.

Also, ignore anyone who says this is easy and that there is no tension. My games are wrought with tension because once you master the rules the game becomes vastly more difficult because it's the little one line addendum that ramp up the difficulty for the survivors. The action is constant, the tension is high and the length is at the top end but not outrageous.

You must try this.

This game does a great job creating a "who is the traitor"  environment and involving everyone in the theme. Every one I play with gets excited over the traitors. Besides the traitor mechanics, the game is a solid co-op game. One of my favorites. It is definitely best with a minimum of 4 players. My kids 7 and up enjoy playing this one. Even the smaller kids, who don't fully understand the mechanics, understand the theme and can follow the direction of other players (when they are not the traitor and are on your side) allowing them to be effective team mates. When my kids are traitors, they can effectively sabotage things and then reveal themselves; so they can play this game well regardless of age. I don't think my board game collection would be complete with out it. After playing many other Co-op games, I come to appreciate BSG even more because it does not suffer as much as other Co-op games from one player "leading" and "helping" others during their turn. No one person takes control of everyone else's decision or pressures them to make certain choices. I think this might be form each player's character having its own strengths and abilities, also a lot of a player's options are hidden from other players? Still a great game, even after all these years. My only complaint is that my kids (game group) are no longer interested in the "game" part, they play to be the traitor. If they do not get to be the traitor there attention drops . . .. and the game suffers. So, because of the current game group I have it does not see much play. Also, I have several of the expansions and feel that the base game is best. The expansions are too pricey for what you actually used. You really only need to buy them if your a completest (like I am) or fan of the show. Truth is, the game did not age well. I had great mechanics for its day, but compared to the newer mechanics of games, it feels a bit slow and long.  I would wait for a Second edition to stream line it before buying. Still glad I have my copy.

I do enjoy cooperative games, and FFG produce high quality products.  One of the best examples of meshing theme and game that I have seen in a long time.  Update:  Finally, after seveal games a human win!  3 resources at 1 and the 4th at 3.  Jumped just as the three cylon players were about to have their turns and most likely kill the humans.Awesome!  Awesome!  Awesome!  Okay, so maybe the cylons win most of the time and your chances of winning are mostly determined by which side you are on, who cares! This game is not primarily about winning (yes I do mean this) it is about the awesome experience of playing the game.  I have played this with several different players and most have really enjoyed themselves.

Solid Game, with a strong hidden traitor mechanics. 
If you are a fan of the show you'll notice that everything in this game is deeply rooted in the BSG universe and provides the same feelings of hopelessness. 

An extreme downside though is its playtime. Even without adding the extra-board of Pegasus Expansion the game constantly breaks the 3-4 hours playtime, although engaging it is a bit too much for the investment.

RATING: 6
Not really as impressed by this as by other co-op games. There seems to a a disconnect for me between how you play and whether you win, ie. it did not seem to matter what we did the game was won or lost according to cards. Sometimes there was a chance and it could be taken, sometimes we were doomed by a couple of unlucky draws. 

I will play it if it's the only option but by this point I'll play almost anything instead. Lowered the rating when I realized I had made a habit of avoiding it.

Edit: Played it again with a rather large amount expansions. This way there was to my relief a lot more ways to fight against the luck of the draw. 

But this even more solified my stance that I like games where I play the game with other people instead of something like this where I must play other people through the setting of the game.

RATING: 9.5
An amazing gaming experience where you must work together to survive while knowing that one of you is betraying the group.  If you are a fan of the TV show, then this is an absolute must; It masterfully captures the tone and themes of the series. Only thing keeping this from a "10" is that it is so dependent on the group you are playing with. Anyone not comfortable playing a cylon can bring the fun of the game down immediately.

Always fun with numerous people. A great balance of how much to help when you never know who the cylon is.... It could be you and you don't even know it yet...

This is my favorite game.

It’s easy to see similarities to Shadows Over Camelot.  Both allow one action and a progression of evil phase.  In both, a player can (potentially in SOC’s case) be playing against the others as a traitor.  Playing both of them feel completely different.  In Battlestar, knowing that in fact there is (will be) a traitor means you do not want to play a game perfectly for the good side because you could find out mid-game you were the traitor all along.

The tension in Battlestar can really mount as resources fall and do feel like you are making the better of the two equally bad options.  Shadows Over Camelot is an enjoyable game, but I would choose this over SOC every time.

RATING: 7
Cooperative game based on the TV series that tries to reproduce the survival of the human race as well as the intrigues surrounding the cylon infiltration in the ship.
The best thing of the game is how thematic it is, it is impossible to play a game without pointing fingers to everybody at some point time shouting "cylon". Exactly as in the series! In addition to that, even with a full crew of humans, the game would be very difficult as you always barely arrive to Kobold. One of the issues, but probably it doesn't have to do with the game, is that the cylon (or cylons) should be players that have played it before, to maximize the impact of their sabotages. A new player may think that the sooner the better, and being caught right at the beginning instead of waiting for the perfect moment. There is another situation that I do not really like and it is why I was thinking of rating the game with a lower number but, as it doesn't have to do with the game, I have put a 7, and it is the "general factor". If there is one player that things that his/her opinion is better than the rest of the players and that the plan has to be doing A, then B, then... you will spend 3 hours just playing the cards that another player is indicating. I would recommend to play this game half-cooperative. We all have to push in the same direction but, please, we are individuals, I am not here to follow orders, that is what I do from Monday to Friday. But that depends on the flexibility of every player. This factor is why I do not play this game, but if your group doesn't have that role, you will have a great time
Positive:
1. How thematic it is
2. Easy to play
3. The game is difficult even without cylons
4. The sleeping agents mechanic is brilliant, even though that simple
5. Can be played with non-gamers
Negative:
1. If there is one "general" type of player, the game can be boring
2. The cylon(s) need to know when to do its move
3. May be too long. Easily it may extend over 3 hours

RATING: 6.5
Great game, one of the better semi-coops/coops with a traitor out there... Climate of paranoia, suspicions and mutual accusations is a ground on which traitor(s) should thrive...  So many options and so many subtle actions a traitor can excercise...

But you need proper company (preferaby people you know and prone to lively discussions) and MOST importantly - people who play _fast_, because otherwise the game has tendency to drag and drag forever... (unfulfilling experience then).

EDIT: After several plays I have enough.  The base game alone became repetitive and the charm is gone too.

Initial rating

I'm more than a little torn on this game. Note I never watched the new series but seen the old one and movie. Note also I very much enjoy Werewolf and hidden role games.  

So I love that they mostly made a "game" around all this hidden role goodness but I did think the game was just too long unfortunately overall for what it offers in total. The game reminded me of Dune actually in some ways especially the epic "feel" of the game and that it is an "experience game". (also its a lengthy game, based on a show and very closely mimics it {so I'm told!} & built around the theme and the in-game rulebook look-up).  Like Dune when I played this I was awfully glad we had an experienced player running it and even he had to look up some rules during play (esp with exp) so it is a little over wrought and that is a detractor along with the length. 

One thing I noticed is it seems there is not that much incentive for a Cylon to stay hidden as they have some better stuff to do once revealed. Of course once revealed that whole tension and accusation part of the game falls flat. I also thought the Cylon choices in general were quite limited overall and if you played cards to hurt the humans due to the colour scheme it could sometimes be narrowed down to only a couple of players who the Cylon is so hard to be productive AND stay hidden. I also seen some pretty non-productive human turns with some decisions being too obvious, I think the expansion does help here but not completely. 

So in one sense I love the game and actually the board is pretty cool because you have a real threat with the Cylon ships attacking and it seems to give you some options to choose from etc (not just a card game with a board because the board does add here) but it seems there are a fair number of rules to keep track of (esp with expansion) and the game does seem too long. If a game could take 2 hours TOPS or under I think it would have been a great hidden role game as the concepts are awesome but running to 3 and more it just feels like it is starting to drag out more and more and just unnecessarily so.  

Note that the expansion adds quite a bit to this BUT I think it also adds more time, see my comments there. This game really would have been much higher rated by many many people and myself if it was just an hour shorter and if there were fewer "non-turns". It actually would have become a favourite for me I think in general if shorter, more streamlined but also a few more options on turns. So close to greatness yet so far too.

RATING: 9
A good cooperative survival game with a bit deduction and "politics" (each players tries to make other players to trust him)
 
Hard to rank as this game is very situationaly.
Note: can be overwhelming to new players. 

Contra:  
- very long
- can have bigger downtime - there are times you cannot do nothing, times when the best play is to "give" your turn to fellow player, etc.
- unbalanced "roles", characters and actions
- very luck dependant (expansions try to fix this)

Pro:
- very thematic
- enough variety to have different experiences (enough roles, cards, etc.)
- very thematic
- with imagination it plays out like a "movie"  
- can raise different emotions during one session (if you get involed enough) 
- sessions can be exciting and provide talk material after it

If you like longer thematic games this is one of the best (I would rate it 9 in that case).

Finally managed a game, and it was good.  A little slow overall, but then it was a first game for all players.  Also managed to win as the Cylons, in an unknown partnership with my wife - Paula wanting to play this makes me happy, however after her second game she is not so keen. I think it is the lack of options you can sometimes get stuck with.
Have been a Cylon three times now, and a human three times, have been on the winning team four times.

I was pleasantly surprised by this game. It's definitely bloated, and if what I'm looking for is the hidden traitor experience I strongly prefer Resistance. But I enjoyed myself. I don't know why but I did. There are some nice decisions about using a card for a high number or for a strong power, but mostly there's just a lot of card drawing and dice rolling and hoping. But somehow it works.

Update: rating went up because of how much fun I have when playing. It's just an entertaining game. It's still not my usual kind of thing, but I really enjoy playing it.

Lots of fun.  Everyone are humans on the Battlestar Galactica, trying to reach Earth.  But 2-3 are actually Cylons trying to sabotage the rest!  Each turn there is a crisis to be surmounted, provided by a crisis card and usually solved by a simple choice or by playing in colored cards that either add or subtract to a needed total.  But secretly so the Cylons can get insidious.  Every turn lots of options as one can play a card, move to a ship location that provides an action, use a special character power, or fly around and shoot Cylon raiders!  Very challenging even without the Cylon saboteurs.  Lots of wonderful paranoia and fingerpointing if you have players that get into the spirit of it.  A bit long though.

Co-op game with some people trying to "sabotage" the game.  Very long and kind of complex for newbies.  A little bit of down time between turns.  Very thematic and you can really get into the whole "You're a fraking cylon, aren't you?" thing.

"That's exactly what a cylon would say!" -Everyone who has ever played this game.

The most tense, paranoia filled gaming experience I've ever had and I loved every excruciating minute of it. While some friendships may be tried, the atmosphere of this semi co-op/hidden traitor game is unrivaled and easily it's biggest strength.

For fans of the show, it captures all of the tension and impossible decisions that made the show so much fun to watch. For those who haven't/refused to watch, don't let the theme keep you away from a great game.

The mechanics aren't as simple as say The Resistance, with much more to worry about besides just who the traitor is and that can turn people off. In addition, the playing time can get to be a bit much for those who aren't willing to invest a couple hours.

RATING: 10
An absolutely fantastic game - one of my all-time favorites.  From a Battlestar Galactica standpoint, this game is dripping with theme.  It immerses you into one of the personas of the show and never falters in thematic gameplay. If you play Starbuck, Baltar, Boomer, or any of your favorite characters, the powers and weaknesses give you the feel of being that person.  The tense game environment of mistrust among each other mixed with the constant struggle for eking out a victory, and simply trying to survive really brings out the perpetual theme from the show, and creates a great game experience.

From a game perspective, Corey Konieczka, famed game designer, has created a well-balanced, punishing, yet rewarding, game.  There are many components that come with the game, so it may appear daunting to newcomers.  After some familiarization with what the different icons or components signify, the game play is fairly simple.  The constant decision-making and balance of threats keeps the player on his or her toes, therefor leaving no down time and zero dull moments.  The game is definitely challenging, and at times crushing (that depends on the Cylon[s]), but it is not impossibly difficult (like Ghost Stories, or Yggdrasil).  In addition, any escape from such situations, or victories, will result in a sense of incredible accomplishment and gratification, which mirrors the feel of the Galactica's sense of accomplishment in the show.

Going back to one of my favorite aspects of the game, there will be a traitor amongst the players.  One of the players will be a Cylon infiltrator and will be working against the Human goals (unless you involve expansions, then there may be various Cylon agendas).  What makes this game mechanic much different than, say, Shadows Over Camelot is that there may not be a Cylon in play the first half of the game, yet suspicions and doubt are still sewn amongst players.  "Why would you do that action instead of this?!"  There is a genius and very thematic "Sleeper Agent Phase" that adds additional "Loyalty" cards midway through the game, which further adds doubt and intrigue.  "Who ruined this skill check with red cards?!  Dave! Dave draws red cards!"

Another great mechanic is the "Destiny Deck" which is a stack of randomly-assorted cards that are added to skill checks.  What this does is it will add possible good or bad cards to a skill check to help hide any possible Cylons, or cause doubt and sew paranoia amongst players, even with no Cylon.

Everything about this game is excellent - the component quality is superb (as is standard with Fantasy Flight), the design and functionality is well-balanced and very tight, the theme is ever-present, it poses a great challenge that feels rewarding if conquered, and if not, it always creates fond memories of spectacular losses and intense game play.

Fans and newcomers alike, I simply cannot recommend this game enough!

After one learning session (6 noobs) I can see why this is the top rated coop game.  The game has a high replay value, and the complexity level alows different ways to play for the two teams.

I'm a little woried about game lenth though, it took us 4 hours, and we were about halfway through.  For sure we are gonna bring the playtime down with experience, but playing under 3 hours seems a little optimistic.

There's a lot going on in the game, so it took me a number of plays to get the sense that I had any clue what I was doing.  But it was worth the effort, because it's a rich gaming experience that's pretty well balanced between the two sides.  And being a cooperative game, the other players helped in getting over the learning curve.  I was never a fan of the series, but that's not necessary to enjoy the game.

Theme: Scifi, inspired by TV show
Gameplay: Individual turns are actually pretty simple, but the rest of the game has a lot of moving parts that can confuse.

Replayability: This is an EVENT game. 
Rulebook: It gets the job done for a game with this much going on. You will need to consult it regularly evev after multiple plays.

Great thematic game - is your friend a Cylon? Or is he just an ordinary human with bad cards? Can you believe the Admiral that he/she leads you to Kobol (well, Commander William 'Husker' Adama is The Admiral for me, but you know... ;) Rear Admiral Helena Cain has the higher rank).
When playing with 5 or 6 players, pilots other than Apollo are useless in the base game (Boomer is OK).

RATING: 6
Well-made experience game. Lots of decisions to be made, lots of potential for paranoia, and lots of excitement thanks to the constant addition of new crises. Theme/mechanics integration is excellent - this really is a game *about* BSG, rather than a game with a BSG theme pasted on.

I have played a couple of games, and like it so far. Both games have been with 6 players, and while that allows group dynamics to flourish, it does mean massive downtime between your turns. On the plus side, one is involved in the game even outside one's turn, but there is no denying that actually getting to *do* something is a rare occurence.

RATING: 10
Yet another reason to love FFG.  Based on the popular series, players cooperate to evade the Cylon fleet and reach their destination, Kobol.  However, in each game at least one player will secretly be a Cylon, working against the others to eliminate the humans.  Uses a very clever card-based system to allow the Cylon(s) to hide their true intentions, which causes paranoia and distrust amongst all players.

Unfortunately, our group of six was given a cursory overview of the rules and then left to our own devices.  We spent 60% of our time looking up rules in the rulebook.  Complete waste of time.  Would play again with someone who has played before.

The mechanics all work wonderfully towards giving the players an opportunity to find out who the Cylon is while capturing the panic and paranoia of the series.

The only downsides are the amount of stuff (and the time it takes to manage it) but difficult to imagine it without and the play time, although I think this game really has a strong social component so as long as you play with friends or people you like to talk to, you shouldn't have any problems spending a few hours with.

RATING: 10
My all-time favourite game!  Theme, mechanics and minis are all incredible.  This is a great game to play with a good group, where accusations really bring the game to life.  The collaborative mechanisms allow all players to participate in the game even when they are not the "current player".  Eliminations (which exist when using expansions) are not permanent.  This game does take a while to play though (normally 3-7 hours including set-up and take-down).

Didn't get the rules and I was a Cylon to start - couldn't ask questions without giving away my position.  Will try again before I rate.  Much better on second play.  Was president and turned Cylon in the middle of the game.  Had everyone else in jail or infirmary when I declared my evilness.

Battlestar Galactica is a mash-up of mechanics that sort of works. The traitor mechanic is pretty dominant and doesn't seem to be as important as players make it out to be. Luck really hurts the game, since the Cylon fleet only comes out on certain cards, and that's really the only time the pressure is on.

I love BSG, maybe I´m a little biased here as I´m a big fan of the series too. I think this is an EXTREMELY fun game, it has been a hit every time I have played it. I just love the way the game lets you manipulate other players and the surprise (and hurt) you see in their faces when you reveal yourself as a Cylon. Great GREAT game, I totally recommend it. It has a long play time but I´m ok with it.

I still love BSG, however today I removed it from my top ten of favorite games, it was replaced by Android: Netrunner. I also downgrading its rating so it matches my feelings for the game with the BGG rating system.

Still a great game and a must buy for me.

Battlestar Galactica is my favorite hidden roles game (and hidden roles is my favorite game mechanic :D). The Resistance comes close but BSG has an epicness to it unmatched by any other game so far (I haven’t played Dead of Winter).

At first I was wary of playing it as I thought it would be a bad port from the series, but gladly I was wrong. As it has a long playtime, it doesn’t come often at our table, but when it does it is a blast. There are a lot of interesting actions/decisions as a Human or as a Cylon. Perhaps the Cylons players have more fun than the Humans but there is fun for everyone.

I’m worried about possible balance issues. Of all my plays, only once the humans have won, so perhaps the Cylons have the upper hand, however most of my games have been close. I need to play more to see if this is an issue for me. I also dislike the “sympathizer card” so I avoid playing with 6 players. BSG is one of the few games that is best with 5 players. Also it depends a lot on the game group, you need the right crowd to enjoy the game, many friends dislike it so try it before you buy it.

Hugely thematic semi Co-Op game. I love it and I want to play with some expansions.

This past year, I have been drifting away from most Ameritrash games. I still love Battlestar Galactica but I prefer to play many Euro Games over it. I won’t ever get rid of the game but getting it to the table is harder these days. My desire to play the game diminished, thus the new rating.

My desire to play Battlestar Galactica again continues to decrease slowly over time. I still like the game, but I’m downgrading its rating. Still, I´m still far away from selling it. I will play it again very soon as my play system selected it for play this month.

One of 2008´s favorites.

By far the best of the traitor games.  The entire game is paranoia and trying to figure out your teams.  If I had a compliant, it's the Cylons can often win on autopilot.  The game might be hard enough if everyone was human and working together.  All in all though, probably the best thing out of FFG in the last several years.

RATING: 10
After one play, seems like the best (semi-)cooperative game I've ever played.  3.5 hours flew by in an instant as we got more and more immersed in this fantastic title.  Components are reminiscent of TI:3 and avoid my major quibble with plastic parts in that the plastic pieces are very easy to tell apart.  As for gameplay, there is a lot of tension, especially right after the sleeper agents are assigned.  The characters are specialized, which makes me want to play the game multiple times to try out all characters.  In fact, I want to play again right now.

In my opinion this is better than Shadows over Camelot in all respects except two:  the longer playtime (if not a negative exactly, does make it harder to schedule a game of BSG) and the lost opportunity to make lame Monty Python cracks.

Maybe one in eight games will be a dreadfully boring affair, with either the human or cylon side playing incompetently and the winning team crushing the other.  The other seven games more than make up for it.

Updated 5/09:  20 plays in and I'm still addicted.  If I could give one game an "11" rating this would be it...and that's coming from a heavy economic/Euro/civ gamer.

After one play I gave this a tentative 8.5 rating. I could see how my score could have been lower if I had been playing with serious, stat-crunching gamers with little or no flare for the metagame. Luckily, this wasn't the case for me. 

EDIT: Reducing to a 7.8. Still a great game, but it can drag a little bit, and become clunky, especially with all of the expansions thrown in. The traitor aspect and the theme really shine despite a rather dry voting mechanic that drives most of the game.

Rating based on one play only

Hmmm, I know it's well ranked but this one left me cold. Took over an hour (which I believe is short for the game), I got all of 3 turns in before we lost. None of us seemed to be able to do anything much (except the traitor, who scewed us royally and quickly through his ability to discard 'easy' bad cards and make us face difficult ones).

It seemed to borrow a lot from Shadows over Camelot but as I'm not a sci-fi fan (sorry Trekkies) the theme meant absolutely nothing to me. While I'm happy to head for Camelot for the occasional game I don't see myself playing this one again

I gave overall rating 8, but game is easily better than that with good companions, I´d say even 9. Co-op gameplay is fun and challenging, there`s always lots to do and with crisis cards theres nice spacing from still and safe moments to hectic chaos moments where everything goes wrong. Theres also clever traitor mechanism, and over half of the games greatness depends how well the Cylon side players can hide themselves and cause disasters behind the scenes, and manipulate human side players to suspect and blame others. Game is also hard on human side, but thats good imo. Some people find that one game takes too long, but at least there isnt many dull moments.

Similar to Shadows of Camelot, but better.  I used to love SoC, but BSG is simply that much better,  I don't see myself EVER playing SoC again.

Great semi-cooperation game that has a player or two (depending on the # of players) helping the board win.

After 20+ plays, the game GENERALLY is a blast!  The tension created by the players trying to learn who the cylon is great.  Many games maintain this tension until the reveal(s) when it becomes a dogfight between humans and cylons for the win.  These games are amazing and fly by, but..........unfortunately, there are games that lead to an early cylon reveal eliminating the tension.  Then the game turns into a simple exercise of performing your actions.  And because the game generally lasts 3 hours, it drags and drags.

Initially, I rated the game an 8, but now lowered it to 7 because those bad games are frequent enough to make the game hit and miss.

This is a first play rating.  I believe the game should rate a little higher, and I will probably rerate after a few more plays.   IT was a lot of fun, and the tension element made it great especially since we had a larger group. The game did become stagnant a couple of times as there were no attacks come up after a jump but it could have been first time play lull.  Great game, I will continue to play and a must for a fan of the series.

A must have, especially if you watched the 2004 TV series. At the beginning of the game each player receive a loyalty card, specifying if you're human or Cylon. Nobody knows who's on what side though all pretend to be human and helping Galactica to escape the Cylons. At half time of the game, a new set of loyalty cards is drafted: each player is given a new card and some human will turn into Cylon and change their game behaviour... but not too much or they'll be send to the brig. You must try this game

Back to 9 because recent play has restored my faith in this game! ;)

Reduced to 8 from 9 because:
- I've found that the procedural straitjacket starts to come to fore after repeated play.

I'm torn on Galactica.  As a pure game, it isn't that great.  Mechanically, there just doesn't seem to be all that much going on.  Because of the way skill checks work, players put in a lot of work resolving even simple issues.  It just feels clunky.  At the same time, sometimes turns and turns go by without any appearance of the Cylon fleet, leaving those who have chosen pilots to circle the Galactica aimlessly.  You almost need to have five people.  Aside from the hated Sympathizer mechanic, there ends up being a lot of down time with six players.

That said, Galactica isn't leaving my collection any time soon.  With the right group of fans, it becomes more of a social experience than a game.  Players quote their favorite lines from the show, and vehemently declare themselves to be human while accusing once-trusted allies of treachery.  It is a lot of fun!  As a pure game, I'm giving BSG a generous six.  Even so, I still enjoy gearing up for a five player game from time to time, and I don't see that changing.

UPDATE:  There have been a lot of advances in the state of the art since BSG was released.  While BSG was an OK system to build on, it's showing its age now, and I got rid of it without remorse.  There are better, quicker, easier co-op/hidden traitor games on the market now.

A great game that captures the atmosphere and theme of the show perfectly. There's the feeling of desperation and paranoia for the human players, and triumph as they jump closer and closer to escape. I must say I enjoyed playing the cylon more, messing with people's minds and then revealing myself to devastating consequences. Mwahahaha!!

The components and cards are beautifully made and look great, although the skill cards are small and can be a bit fiddly. My only other qualm with the game is that it can tend to go on just that little bit too long. This is a game I'll be happy to play whenever I get the chance.

UPDATE:  Feeling well prepared, though after reading and viewing various articles and videos from this site, I've come to the conclusion that the three of us is NOT enough to play this co-op game (well).  We'll have to incorporate our older son as a fourth into the fold when he's home from school.  Looking forward to it.

I received this game as a gift from my husband who didn't realize how many players were required to play.  Gotta love'm though.  I won't rate this until I've had several decent plays.

BSG can really drag in places. It needs the right crowd to get the best out of it, preferably people who have played before. The skill checks do wear on me a little, having to futz with all those tiny cards. I'm less and less convinced by the game every time I play it. Sold.

RATING: 2
Based on 1 play.

This session was with 5 players and clocked in at roughly 4.5 hours. Now I heard that the game plays in 3-4 hours so this this isn't bad with two newbies. The real problem is that there isn't enough game here to justify spending that much time at the table with it. If it played in 60-90 minutes it might be okay.

Turns are straight forward you move and take an action. Yes plenty of games have that mechanic. What I'm looking for in games are interesting decisions to be made an the opportunities for a clever play. Unfortunately, I didn't see that here. Now I must state that I wasn't a Cylon and they have to figure out how to keep conning us. But as a human you are looking out for the best interest of the ship which means doing what's best, yawn. Some cards allow you to pass an action to another player or have crisis resolution played face up or make blue cards positive and if you're the human it is in the groups best interest to do so. 

The crisis cards are what move the game along allowing the Galactica to "jump" and the Cylons to attack. They also have pass/fail items that the group must decide on and then play cards to influence the outcome. It's a nice idea but the outcomes don't leave much to discuss. We never saw a card that as humans you would argue passing vs failing. So if we were okay with a fail we allowed it to happen and if we wanted a pass we played cards. If we wanted to force the pass we played the card that made all offerings to influence face up.

As someone who hasn't seen the show there was no more theme to me than playing checkers. I don't need theme if the game is good but for those of you that do then beware.

As the president I started in a separate ship where I could collect Quorum cards. At the end of 4.5 hours I was still in the same room, yep I never moved. My turns consisted of either drawing cards or allowing someone else to take an action on my turn. 

The game ended with us looking to make our final jump. On a roll of 7 or 8 we win if not we lose. The die came up 4, we lost. Thankfully the game was over. I'm not sure who rejoiced more the Cylons or the humans.

Was that fun you ask. No, no it wasn't fun.

BSG is a "team" game. Ostensibly, players play cooperatively to beat the Cylons, but some players are cylons in disguise and try to secretly sabotage the efforts of the humans. The humans win if they meet their goal (Jump a distance of at least 8 units and then jump one last time) and the cylons win if they stop the humans from reaching that goal. There are some interesting mechanics that enable the cylons to work against the humans without making their identities obvious. Good 'ol deception is still a big part of the game, so your behavior at the table is critical, but at least the mechanics won't blow your cover by themselves.

I'm a bigger fan of team/secret identity games than I am of straight co-ops and this is a good one. At the very least, this has to be the best board game based on a television property. Do note, the game takes a long time to teach and a long time to play. It features the usual FFG rules bloat.

Update: Dead of Winter accomplishes a lot of what BSG does and does it more efficiently in a more playable time frame and format. I've downgraded my score of BSG from an 8 to a 7 simply because Dead of Winter highlights just how ridiculous the rules bloat and intricate mechanics truly are on this one. However, to be fair, Dead of Winter probably wouldn't exist if BSG had not preceded it.

I am a huge fan of the reimagined series (never cared for the original) and thus this is a "wish" game for me - to play. Not to buy perhaps, cause I would not have any audience of the show to play with me around here... Nice mechanics, traitors, cylons and raiders. YAY!

Too long and repetitive. Our game with 4 players, who were all first timers, took 4.5 hours including set up and teaching.

The theme is strong but its not enough to save it for me.  I'm sure I'll end up playing this again though, as the others seemed to like it.

RATING: 5
So after a few plays I think this is a pretty good co-op game. 

PROS: Compared with the LOTR and Shadows, BSG is more thematic, has more tension, is harder to win (if human), and has better catch phrases like "frakin' toaster".

CONS: The game is easily 3 hours and waiting for those crisis cards with the FTL jump symbols feels gamey and annoying. I think a quorum card that allowed you to advance the jump marker at some risk similar to the food and moral cards could easily fix this without making it too easy.

My experience with this game have been quite mixed. The first couple of times I played it I really enjoyed it. Then I played it one time and didn't enjoy it. Then I played again and really enjoyed it.

I think I finally realised that this is a game you need to approach like Arkham Horror, like it's almost a role playing game. Don't just play it to win, play it for the experience and if you also happen to win, bask in the glory.

I have only played this once (and that was an incomplete game due to time) and really want to play again. The problem for me is a common one for hidden traitor games that are not quick. There are people in my gaming groups that simply would not know what to do if they are the traitor and might freak out/give up/roll over. For the first time in a 20 minute game, not a problem. For a game of this length and effort, not good. I am looking forward to playing this one.

Great implementation of theme and mechanics, this was apparent even for someone like me who’s never seen the show.  Beautifully produced.  Really feels like an epic adventure, at 3 hours playtime (for 4 of us).  However, it was verging on a little too much downtime, and it dragged at times.  One drawback is that just by sheer luck one (non-cylon) player can be sent to the brig for several turns (as the sympathizer) and also get a lot of sickbay cards.  As a first-time player and being that one unlucky player it got a bit frustrating to get my one special power taken away upon going to the brig, and with all the additional downtime, since each round of turns took so long to get through anyway.
I liked the variety of crisis cards, and the calm peace of empty black space right after jumping away from a cylon attack.

Bottom line is, I play games to have fun, and simulating sitting in a brig, however thematic it might be, is not fun :-)  I get that it's all about social dynamics and the co-op aspect, but I just don't enjoy it.  As co-ops with traitor elements go, I much prefer Shadows Over Camelot.

I really, really, really wanted to like this game and I absolutely love the tv series, but I found this far too repetitive.  It's the same 3 kinds of Crisis card, the same 3 kinds of skill card per deck and the same location actions over and over and over again.  Granted I've only played it with 4 and I think that made it very uneven on the side of the Cylons, but I don't see much replay value in this game.

This game is very interesting with the right group of people. You have to be able to revel in argument and be quick on your feet manipulating perception and offering whatever evidence and assurances you can.

Clearly a solid game that isn't for me.

I'm amazed that a t.v. show themed game is this good. The game mechanics are great and they do a great job of reflecting the feel of the show. The game remains fresh and fun after many plays, something that Shadows over Camelot failed to do (it's another semi co-op game).

**Update** Played with a good group & with the expansion - love it.

This is still top of my play list with a good group of people - 3 or 4 players gets done in 1:30.

Probably not worth buying my own copy as several of my regular gaming friends have copies.

**Recieved in trade for Waterloo Dec 09**

Yet to play with Caprica / Cylon Leader.

*Update April 10* Still love this game, it just gets better and better for me.

I have only played this once and was very excited to try it out. However, this is most likely one of those cases where a person I was playing with ruined the experience. There were 5 of us and only the person explaining it had played it before. He'd played it a lot and knew the game very well but the rest of us were only familiar with the rules from videos and skimming through the rulebook. The guy teaching the game was way too vague in his explanations and was hardly willing to answer our clarification questions. The rest of us were just frustrated, confused and bored to death. One lady left early. Turns out the experienced player was a cylon and was just playing to win. No wonder he didn't want to answer our questions. Anyways, hoping to have a more positive experience with this in the future.

I've immensely enjoyed the entire series, so I was very curious about this game. I love it! This is my favorite traitor-based cooperative game. The ruleset seems skinny, but allows a lot of freedom for player-interaction. I think it's amazing how the mechanics and card-texts can cause a real sense of paranoia and dread. In some cases the game can last too long. The Resistance is a good replacement for need of a shorter game, but when there's time to build up a story, then BSG is the way to go. Maybe BSG Express can combine the best of both games: a great story in a more playable timespan.

Houserule: remove the value "1" Kobol cards. Decreases downtime and doesn't impact the experience for my and my friends.

My first and only play was atypical as one player had both Cylon cards and was very passive which might have marred the experience. Also some expansions were added which in turn led to many options not being used once in the game. My main concern is the bad ratio of decisions vs. playtime in the game which makes the metagame of guessing the traitor(s) the interesting part. This hinges on the individual players and you need the right group for this. Not sure if Battlestar works out for me on repeated plays. Could see this dropping if I don't see much variety between games or a more intensive metagame.

Played our first game last night. 3-player game.  Fantastic!!! Blind accusations and mistrust galore. I played Tom Zarack(?) and fought with Lee Adama all night over the Presidency.  Had him thrown in the brig for taking my 'president' status and giving it to someone else.  He had me put in sick bay.  Got the 'presidency' back and then the Cylons turned up in force.  We all pulled together to fight them off and then it was back to our infighting.  Hilarious stuff!  We all marvelled at how true to the series our game played out. It turned out that no-one was a Cylon till mid-game but we might as well have been.  Probably better with 5 or 6 players.  More mayhem, accusations and suspicion to go round.

Gameboard, photos and playing pieces are excellent quality and very appealing.  We all enjoyed handling the components.  Rules are easy once learned and combat is simple - which is good because when your being swamped with Cylons the game doesn't get bogged down.  We found that we had to 'jump' the more we got swamped as we couldn't fight them all off. Just like the TV series. Great stuff!  Can't wait to play more.

31 May 2009 Update - Have played a total of 4 times now.  The more players the more fun.  A real blast. Our gaming group loves it. There's a bit of something for everyone. Combat, passing Crisis tests, accusing others of being a Cylon.  This would actually play great solitaire too.  You would just play hard when you took a Cylon turn. The Sympathizer card is actually very clever.  It balances the game.  The card comes out mid-game.  If the humans are doing too well the Sympathizer becomes a Cylon and helps the other Cylon/s.  If the Cylons are caning the humans, the Sympathiser simply goes to the brig but remains human.

18th Jan 2010 Update - Still great fun.  Played a four player.  Somehow, the cylon player had myself and another human player convinced each other was a cylon.  We accused each other all game until toward the end when the cylon player revealed himself.  We couldn't believe it! Humans lost...just.

6 Oct 13 Update - Changed rating to a 6. Will play it but it takes so long and the shine has worn off. Not hitting the table because of length of play.  

July 17 - Oh dear. This one had finally died for our group I think. The accusations are still fun but it doesn't kind of matter that players are cylons. They reveal themselves at some point and disappear to the resurrection ships and then play havoc with the humans. But it's the same dance that has occurred every game. I'd rather play Resistance for my hidden spies fix I think. We're also bored with the crisis cards every player turn. You bust a gut to pass with no benefit - just the benefit of not suffering the consequence. It would be better if you were rewarded with finding a water/fuel/food supply or an early jump or something, just not nothing all the time.

RATING: 10
I like the theme/concept of this game a lot. The idea that there is a hidden traitor in your midst creates a wonderful gameplay experience. The paranoia in this game is really high and it makes for a very unique cooperative game. I'm not very good at figuring out who the Cylons are, but I always have fune nonetheless. However, there are a couple downsides to note: First, pilots are boring. If I wanted to spend this much time in sickbay, I would eat my mom's cooking. Second, the game is clearly unbalanced. Unless the Toaster is a frakkin' moron, the humans don't stand much of a chance. Their own paranoia often causes them to do more harm to each other than the Cylons. However, I like how this unbalance fits thematically. So say we all!

The game lasts hours but feels like you don't get more out of it than its 60 minute cousin (Shadows over Camelot).

My first hidden traitor game and based on the IP that ushered me into the golden age of television. BSG hits the sweet spot of theme and game mechanics that is hard to outmatch. I generally enjoy it with several expansion modules these days but the original game is still the complete package.

There are a couple of small problems with the base game being limited fun things to do for pilots and the boring sympathizer mechanic. The former was to me and my group rectified by the great Cylon Fleet Board from Exodus and the latter by the official "no sympathizer" variant.

Not having watched the TV show, there's not as much to connect with, but I can see how it would really enhance the game for those that have.

I was pleasantly surprised with the game, as I was not a fan of Shadows Over Camelot.  I think what really sets this game apart is the general sense of paranoia about who may or may not be a cylon.  I'm not that experienced with SoC, but it feels quite different than the speculation about the trader.

My main concern is game length - at 90 minutes I would be happy to play this at about anytime, but over 2 hours is really too much for what will probably become repetitive with more plays.

Update, 3/15: No desire to play, completely replaced by Resistance. This is just too long. If I was a BSG fan, maybe, but as it is, no.

I like the game, but it is an emotional investment (as well as financial). More fun if you are the cylons....or a sympathiser.

Additional Information
Enjoyable game with the right crowd. There needs to be accusations and trickery thrown left and right. Passive players make the game mundane. Actions are simple enough to jump right into the game so it's beginner friendly. 

However, the mechanic relies a bit [b]too much on luck of the draw[/b]. Cylons are crippled if they don't get the right timing of cylon fleets. The main element is that if 1 Cylon player gets all of Cylon cards (Sympathizer + 2 Cylons), the cylons are sure to lose. It takes too long to pass cylon cards to other players and its far too inefficient to play mind games by passing "You are not a cylon" cards to other players. This should be a free action.

Also, the decks are too small (in size and number) which requires constant reshuffling.

If these factors were fixed, I'd have no hesitation to rate this game perfectly. Still, it's amazing that BGG produced [b]a quality release for a very reasonable price[/b].

An excellent, extremely tense, easy-to-learn co-op game. It is based on the BSG universe, so players who are more familiar with the universe might enjoy it more.

Gameplay is simple compared to other FFG games. No player aid required. What I like most is how the game manages to create a very intense feel of survival. Players get very involved with solving problems and trying to see the BSG to Kobol.

Its not perfect however. The game takes a bit too long. The loyalty system can be a bit problematic. And the components are a tad too small to be easily moved around.

Ratings after one play.  The game took five hours.  Yeah, a lot of it was people who gushed about this or that episode (which I haven't seen).  But it seems like reports of 3+ hours is pretty common for a first play.  The problem is that you get to do stuff for about 1/2 hour worth of game.

It is one of the best Co-Op games with a traitor mechanic and regardless of the expansions (I've played it with all combinations except the modular additions from Exodus) which sets the ending at a different place the game remains a nerve wracking experience which keeps everyone on his toes. Especially if you are a fan of the show there are so many moments which remind you of the episodes or movies - really awesome.

Also this is one of the rare games which gets better at a higher player count. Wouldn't recommend playing it with less than 6 players.

Have some trouble rating this one and being fair. Since I am a battle star
Fan. What makes this game for me is trying to get into the character 
That i'm playing. Out side of that fun, the game to me isn't that great,  more of a fan type of fun, I play with others that are fans, we have a good time, but move maybe and play soles cards isn't all that great. Although I really enjoy being a cylon, that for some reason is what makes the game.

The game simply isn't balanced properly when using just the base set. Flavor isn't enough to carry a game by itself and there are better games for getting the thrill of the traitor mechanic.

I still have yet to play this all the way to the end, but I love it! It captures the tension of the first season of the show perfectly. I love blaming all of my friends for being Cylons. It poses many interesting decisions that have to be made throughout the coarse of the game, and often times no matter what you do, you can still appear to be a "Toaster" Love it and can't wait to get it to the table again!

Battlestar Galactica is a great game of mistrust and politics and I have never turned down an opportunity to play it. There isn't much bad to say about the game although the game is usually very long which means it is not played that often. If you play it tired the paranoia is truely happening.

RATING: 7
I have never seen a second of the TV series. Even then it didn't take long to get into this. Playing a five-player game of this was one of the funniest plays I've ever encountered. After two hours of gaming everyone was laughing with tears flowing from our eyes. This was because the game has been created so beautifully that pretty much everything you decide to do after the very start of the game can be seen in the light of suspicion and reasoned to be cylonic. A great experience of bluffing and treachery that certainly needs the right crowd. Also, the players in our group that are fanboys of the series thought the theme to have been implemented really well.

Edit 2: I don't think it'll ever get played -- we've tried a couple of times but it's long and complicated in a many-moving-parts way. If I'm playing 3-4 hours I'd rather play through the ages or twilight struggle!

A game that integrates its theme very well and seemingly does several things right that Shadows over Camelot did wrong. However, the balancing system has been said to be clunky and in my game it was so: when the third player turned against the humans, none of our plans mattered any more because there was just no way to go on. Sure, the reveal was something of a bang (spending actions and resources to boost the sympathetic Cylon because it seemed like the best way to win, then bam! O, the irony) and the Cylon players rejoiced, but if the game was going to be cut short in that fashion it could have happened a good hour sooner. Apparently works better with five, which would also give each player more screen time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Fun, tense and challenging game which has a Pandemic feel to it.  Like Pandemic, there are moments of elation when it appears that the good guys are doing very well and have an excellent chance to win.  Of course, when the Cylons are revealed, it can, and usually does, all go to hell in a very short amount of time.  Then, it becomes a race to the end.  Loads of fun.

Fun co-op game, however there is way to much going on for what little actual game there is involved. Also the fact that you may not know you are a Cylon until halfway through the game may be thematically sound but is mechanically awful. I will say that it did a great job of capturing the excellent theme and feel of the show.

Good Game dripping with theme. There is a small issue of the game taking too long for what it is. It feels like it could be stream-lined to allow for quicker game play. It drags. rated a 6.5 Edit: Game still drags but it was alot of fun! Took 4 hours! Dripping with theme. Rerate to a 7.5.

Rerated: 4.5 - Still a decent game but when everyone knows who everybody is the game is long, drawn out, and boring! I will not be picking this one up. I'm disappointment to say the least. Way too long for what the game does for me. With the great graphics, and strong theme I'll give it a 4 and .5 for the effort.

Excellent game, in my opinion. If you don't like the series, avoid this one. You'll be bored by the repetitive skill checks and rather slow gameplay. And the Cylons have the advantage. :) BUT, if you're a fan of the series, like our group, this is the game to get. The strength of the game is not the game itself, but the meta-game that goes on inside the main game. The suspicions and overall paranoia deliver the MAIN POWER to the gameplay, and make you forget about the downtime, and overall length of the game. Some characters are more useful than others, but I consider that a strength too. Are the humans on equal ground with the toasters in the series? NO... Frakking good... Best co-op so far, for me, that is. ;) UPDATE 29.9.09 The gameplay starts to feel a bit repetitive. Pegasus Expansion to the rescue!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Pretty fun game. I'd suggest playing it with confident players though. What do I mean? Well, gameplay is fast and rather simple on a turn by turn basis, with the complexity coming from player interaction. So people constantly hesitating on their moves or being overwhelmed by other (louder) players really slows it down.

I like some of the expansions. I think... Daybreak added the Treachery deck? Very nice addition.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Well, OK, a few caveats. I have never finished a game. The one time I did play we made it as far as our second loyalty card. But I can kind of see where it was going, and I don't particularly think the game is worth the money you'd spend on it. While some might have fun trying to guess whether there's a Cylon in their midst, the game makes actually being a Cylon so meaningless as to make what could have been the game's best mechanic into an appendage to a passable space game. Some characters are far worse than others (paging Helo to the Galactica... Also, why is he out of the game for the first round? Shouldn't that be, um, Anders?) 

There are also fairly silly strictures on what you can and cannot say at the table. (This is my new pet peeve. You can tell me the rules, but do not tell me how to handle in-game chatter.) Players are encouraged to tout others as "the Cylon," but there's no real in-game reason to bother. 

And then there's the cards you use for skill checks. What, they couldn't come up with more than two card ideas per skill? I found myself discarding certain types of card over and over again because all you really need is one of each type going into each round - you can't use more than one skill card anyway, so having only a few card types per skill is a pretty serious flaw. Also, we always ended up with more skill cards than we needed - they just weren't scarce as they should be.

I dunno... I think this is the most overhyped game I've played recently, and while I'd love to give it another shot, so far it seems DOA.

---------------------

Update: While I still think this game consists of pulling crisis cards and trying to mitigate their effects, which is not very much fun, it's also the kind of game that's probably more fun to lose than to win. After a game that I ruined by undercutting my fellow players on a skill check despite being a human myself, I realized that the atmosphere and paranoia are as essential to gameplay as they are destructive to your actual chances of winning, since the more time you spend ferreting out cylons, the less time you have to do other, more important things. On one hand, I feel like the best strategy is to simply overpower the cylon by spending skill cards freely on skill checks and using every opportunity to get as big a hand of cards as possible (when you're not repairing, piloting, etc.). But on the other hand, that strategy ignores the traitor half of the game, and may be unsustainable when there's more than one cylon. 

I don't really like this as much as my friends do, but it does exert a strange and inexplicable power over me, sort of like the TV series, which I liked for 2 seasons, but spent the rest of the show yelling at the screen. I'll play it again, and have upgraded it to a 6 from a 4.5, but I remain suspicious. I'd like to see what they do with expansions that take the game past season 1. Maybe they can adapt Mammoth Hunters for the final expansion!

---

Update 3:

Have upgraded to an 8. I still think there are serious problems with this game, the foremost being the inertia of the "take a handful of cards, take another card, play the handful... or don't" system. 

That said, there's an undeniably amazing soft game here. The stuff on the board is the tip of the iceberg.

DO NOT play this with people who: are boring, stupid, uptight, easily annoyed, untalkative, unsubtle, bad liars, people who cheat, people who haven't seen the show, or people with no sense of humor; MOST of all, don't play it with people who refuse to follow the rules.

update: I have decreased rating bit as sometimes games tend to be longer than they need to be.

Great game with superb and tense atmosphere. At this point I prefer Galactica to any other co-op game. Sessions of Galactica are unforgettable experience for all of our group. We are chatting about them after game and everyone is really enjoying either being Human or Cylon. Only drawback can be that game is sometimes too long.

At first (before buy) I was quite sceptical (another Shadows over Camelot came to mind - which except game components is nothing great). But now I am really happy that I purchased game. One of best spent amounts in this hobby so far.

This is an insanely excellent game.  Exceptional blending of mechanics and theme, the game really comes alive and takes on a feeling incredibly close to the TV Show.  The back and forth debate over who's a Cylon and who isn't, working together co-op while all the while wondering when your seemingly closest friend is going to stab you in the back.....in a word, brilliant.  

The only possible downside I can see is that it really works best with more people (5 or more), but I still think it definitely qualifies as a 10.

Was very positively surprised about this game. I only watched the crappy old series as a child and the only thing i remembered about Battlestar Galactica was that it was something about fighting evil robots. 
But the game has some really well thought out mechanics and the theme is very well integrated. While you work together against the evil Cylons you have traitors in your group, and the game does a very good job at creating an atmosphere where you can't trust anyone while you still have to work together to survive. You might even be the traitor yourself but only get to know this later in the game.
Never experienced any other game that manages to create such a dense atmosphere in a very short time.

First play: Seems to be entertaining, but it also seemed like we generally performed the same actions ad nauseum. Most parts of the ship weren't even visited, and I don't think I got much of a feel of decision-making.

This may be somewhat due to playing with experienced players who helped me along, but maybe not. It was interesting to switch to the Cylon side halfway through, but as a sympathizer I had only two choices each turn for the rest of the game, and once we were past the point where damaging the ship could happen fast enough, there really was but one option.

And then the game was ultimately decided by a 50-50 die roll. Seemed a bit silly.

Still, have to try again before really making up my mind.

Second play: Went differently than the first. Still interesting, still not entirely sure there are a lot of interesting decisions to make.

I'm not the target audience.  I didn't really like RK's Lord of the Rings, and Pandemic was at best innocuous for me.  BSG offers a nice theme, and spiffy bits.  But the length bothered me.

In our game the Admiral was a cylon, and we didn't figure this out soon enough.  The fleet ran out of fuel, which seemed darn hard to find more of - so that was it.

Just one play, so I suppose my rating could change.  But this isn't the sort of game I'm likely to chase down to play - so this may be my final word on the game.

Sharp hidden-role game that hews wickedly close to its theme.  If you liked the show at all, and like board games at all, you will love this.  If you hated the show then you should probably play Are you a Werewolf or Panic Station instead.

Besides Eclipse this is probably my most thematic game where theme and mechanics strongly support each other. Every game I played felt worth its time and was always tense. Unfortunately, the game seems to only work properly with 5 people that know the game (i.e. have played a bit). This makes it really hard to get it out to play. Due to that fact it might drop as time passes.

I strongly suggest to add the expansions. (I only played once without them so I might be biased though)

Always enjoyed playing this one. Doesn't hurt that I was a big BSG fan and that the theme came across well in this game.  Also mechanically sound.  I enjoy it much more than Shadows over Camelot.

RATING: 7
1 partida.

Está muy logrado el juego respecto a lo que ocurre en la serie. Se trata de un juego a caballo entre lo colaborativo y los roles ocultos, con sus correspondiente faroleo para tratar de que no descubran a los que les haya tocado ser Cylon (los malos).

Sin duda, lo más divertido es ese suspense de no saber quien es quien y tener qué cosas hacer, con la incógnita de si te van a sabotear las votaciones o no.

En cuanto al desarrollo del juego en sí, llegas a temer por tus recursos y tu nave, cuando ves que rápidamente se pueden llegar a acumular muchas flotas Cylon a tu alrededor, pero consigues hacer "saltar" la nave y, de repente, todo despejado... o no! (igual saltas a otro lugar con más naves).

Me ha gustado más de lo que esperaba, porque era de las primeras veces que jugaba a un juego tan largo y, además, pensaba que sería mucho más complicado. Si te lo explican y tienes a alguien que sabe jugar no es difícil, aunque tiene pinta de ser una dura labor enseñarse a jugar de cero.

No le pongo más nota por la duración de las partidas y porque, por consiguiente, no es un juego que se preste a jugarlo continuamente, ni con toda clase de personas.

I LOVE this game. I like the Cylon aspect a lot. I also enjoy the different roles that people can go after. If I'm not a Cylon, I typically go pilot. My only complaint about this game is that the Cylons typically use only one of their abilities; when I play as a Cylon, I mix it up and use at least two of their abilities on purpose to mitigate this complaint.

Classic Semi-Coop?

I have mixed feelings about this one. I think the game is good; it's very thematic, have good game mechanisms and it's expecially interesting for the player interaction.
The sense of paranoia that this game induce is unmatched.
Sounds good eh?

BUT

It's too long for me. And for what it does. After the 2nd hour of play, IMHO, the game should be finished, instead you probably have to play yet at least 1 hour.

Doing the same stuff.

and the same.

A solid game, but not for my taste.

This was the game that got my family and I hooked on board games. My wife and I are huge fans of the show and we just had to own everything Battlestar. When I learned from a co-worker about this board game I was intrigued. My family and I played a full 6 player game and we all loved it even my sisters who did not even care for the show. My uncle who is a Axis & Allies vet said he never played a game quite like this. Once you learn the game it’s easy to teach others, just "learn as you play" method. My Family love playing this game. Note:

Don't Play:
~7-Player Variant
~New Caprica
~Cylon Leaders

Played this game so much that the flaws are showing. Game is to long and once cylons are revealed the game becomes a painful drag to see how long humans can last till they lose.

Our family now played this game over 20+ times and:
This game is getting worse and worse the more we play it... The Game is not only to darn long but the moment the cylons are revealed it becomes a game that DRAGS! It is a slow boring process to see how long humans will last till they lose....

I enjoy this beautiful cooperative game, but in general I'm not as crazy about it as a lot of other people are.  Both times I've played it, the game felt a bit boring any time that Cylon ships weren't on the board.  Plus, most of the crisis cards (especially the skill checks) feel way more mechanical than thematic to me.  Like I said, it's still fun and worth a play every so often, but it's no where near my favorite coop game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Not merely the best semi-cooperative game made yet to date, one of the best games of any type. It is one of a very few games that do a fantastic job of marrying theme to mechanics, yet ensure that a new player need neither know the theme to understand the game, nor make the mechanics so cumbersome that they detract from the thematic enjoyment. Unlike some co-operative games (even others with traitor elements), this one is not a puzzle in which one or two players direct the action for everyone else. All players must genuinely make their own choices, and not every choice will be what the other players want - even those on your own team. 

Box says 2-3 hours and this is just about dead-on accurate (though figure in an extra 1/2 hour if you're teaching new players). Designed for 3-6 players, but best balanced for 5. Still a very good and enjoyable game for 4 or 6. 3 is playable, but it seems like there needs to be some variants or adjustments for 3 players to give it the same tension and fun as with more players. 

Well worth the bucks.

RATING: 7
The game doesn't have any of that angel/prophecy nonsense from the series in it, which is a plus. This game initially got a lot of play for one that could run three hours long. This game does make paranoia fun, but that's where most of the fun lies. It sucks to be the sympathizer (not a real Cylon, after all), so we simply sent the sympathizer to the brig and then let them resume play as a human. It also sucks that the Cylon is only fun before it gets revealed. When the paranoia stops, so does most of the fun. We also tended to find it hard for the humans to win, so we sometimes used the variation that increased their starting resources. Ultimately got rid of it because I felt like there was too much down-time on other players' turns.

One of the best team-play board game I've played so far. It's not about long-term strategy or character developing. It's more about fast thinking, paranoia and acting skills :)

We've played too much of it in a first month, so little bit a burn out right now. Nevertheless, it's a lot of fun to throw a new people on Battlestar Galactica, and observe how they evolve :)

RATING: 6
Battlestar Galactica is a partially cooperative board game which follows  very tight narrative and can be extremely immersive. The mechanisms, individually, are not particularly clever nor streamlined, and the game is quite luck driven, but the paranoia that builds during the sessions is brutal. All the game is about telling apart the Cylon from the humans (even if you are Cylon, as you want to know who your partner is to maximize damage).

Most of the game revolves around the action cards: they have a number, which serves to complete (or frustrate) events that will be popping up, and an action, which gives you some sort of bonus. So a key part is handling your actions, as you will want them for both uses, but once a card is played, is gone. Events will be popping up, with players adding action cards face down to try to amass a certain score by adding the values displayed on the cards. The tricky part is that cards are colour coded, and only some colours add to the score: the rest subtract. And if the required score isn't met, something nasty happens, to the amusement of the Cylon players. As two extra are added from a neutral deck, players never really know if who, if anyone, is hijacking.

Aside from the action cards, the players can move around the ship to use the FTL control, fire the cannons or to go to the docking bay, jump into a fighter and take the fight a bit more personally, amongst other things. This helps with immersion greatly and is a key part for surviving (as a human). Also, if you believe that a player is a Cylon you can try to send him to prison, but... Is the accused truly a Cylon and not the accuser who is trying to frame everybody? Almost everything that a player does can have a double meaning, because what might seem a direct threat for one player, other can see it as something less urgent to deal with.

The main problem of this title is that it's quite possible to come to stagnant situations were the game does not progress. Worst cases of this can happen if several characters are in prison or when playing with three or four players. The first usually means the cylons have won, but when a player is in prison no crisis card is drawn. So basically, human players do not do anything meaningful but not enough bad things happen for cylons to end the game soon. The "no crisis card drawn while in prison" rule probably is to balance things out, but I personally prefer a more brutal game than one with deadlock issues. Regarding the four player games, whoever is the cylon is alone, which can easily get boring, as you usually cannot do enough damage to pull a win, but are also annoying enough to slow the human players.

All in all, BSG is a very narrative game based on a very popular license. I must admit that I do not like the TV show, so being an avid fan of it is definitely not mandatory. Having said that, watching at least the pilot episode is recommended to know what is going on.

Very good semi-cooperative deduction game. The paranoia and mistrust, the wild accussations, the incredible difficulty for the humans, the tension ... it feels just like the TV series. Great adaptation to an interesting boardgame and an excellent cooperative game without the domination of a single player as found in most of the other games of this type. The traitor mechanism for the cyclons actually works. *** Four plays: 1x Baltar/human - humans lost, 1x Chief Tyrol/human - humans won (but very close!), 1x Roslin/human - humans lost, 1x Chief Tyrol/cylon - cylons won.

A perfect translation from the TV series. Skill checks mechanic really makes all players involved & constantly guessing about other players' motive.

Since I played space empires 4x I looked at axis & allies thinking if I could ever enjoy those again. The answer is yes. I will play them for simplicity but the magic is gone. My toughts are with se4x when i play a&s.

Now after bsg I'm looking at dead of winter with the same toughts. I will keep playing dow for its simplicity and fast play but tonight it losts its magic.. bsg is the mistress now :)

Fun sabotage game, one or more members of your starship crew "COULD BE" an enemy(Cylon).  But know one knows for sure.  
Your ship jumps through hyper space from location to location, as you are trying to get to your home planet.  Your resources are low, and stuff keeps happening to lower it even further, on top of that, someone might be sabotaging it to get it down even more!
Trust no one, and watch everyone closely...
Even worse...  Half way through the game, someone that was a "good guy" could become a saboteur...

This is a great game, but those who don't follow the TV Series it's based on, might not enjoy the game to it's fullest degree

RATING: 7
Gra wyłącznie dla miłośników serialu? Z pewnością znajomość filmu stanowi argument przemawiający za zakupem gry. Z pewnością pozwala także wczuć się w specyficzny klimat walki o przetrwanie, podejmowania trudnych decyzji i lekkiej nutki paranoi. 

Czy gra w innej otoczce obroniłaby swoją notę? Mechanizm kooperacyjny działa bez zarzutu. Ukryci Cyloni mogą skutecznie szkodzić, nie ujawniając swojej tożsamości. Wykonanie nie budzi zastrzeżeń. Zatem: tak, gra jest niezła, niezależnie od tego, czy nazwisko 'Adama' coś nam mówi, czy nie.

I really don't get why people like this one.  I assume is Battlestar Galactica fanboyism.  It is a cooperative game where you are secretly in competition with n other players (where n = 0, 1, 2 in the first half, and n = 2 in the second half).  For all that, the game seems utterly dominated by the luck of what space battle (or whatever) comes up.  That said, the folks I was playing with who had watched the show seemed really into it.  So, YMMV. I could be talked into this again, I suppose.

Maybe a little bit too high my rating but its a game I can play with anyone I feel. I also liked the show (i liked it so much that i overheated my Ps 3  watching season three in one go. have to replace it)

What's good about it is that every decision is bad.
And the cylon / human vibe is there.
It caught the spirit very well..


Why no more comments on the game? Well it's hard to say.
Its unlike a boardgame I've ever played and for that reason it is hard to place it. Would I suggest playing this. Yes.
Is it a top ten game? I really don't know. Because I can't place it anywhere.

Don't go looking for meaningfull decisions here.
sure lots of tough decisions but game probably is decided by guesses based on probability.

The sheer amount of intrique, trickery, deceit, and verbal mischief in the semi coop is just astonishing. I usually hate everything from Fantasy Flight games, but this is a rare exception. Game has pretty much downtime and is really only playable with 5, but other than those, it is a gem.

RATING: 8.3
My first game was a bit dull to be honest but the second one, when everyone was already acquinted with the game,  was definitely better. It's like The Resistance mixed with Space Alert (but no real time action). Thematically it is very strong and the gameplay is quite smooth. I think there should be more variety in cards though (can be added with expansions). I would also like there to be more combat with spaceships. In our plays there were only a couple of combat dice rolls because there are so few cylon fleet cards and when you do the FTL jump, the cylon fleet will stay behind. The enjoyment of BSG is probably largely dependent on your gaming group style (I think the game suffers if everyone is very conservative and only tries to keep track of cards rather than play the social game - similarly to The Resistance).

Only had 1 play at strategicon, so it was all very new.  Played with a group of 5 and there was a good amount of playful bantering about which of us was the Cylon.

Especially as a fan of the show, each of the playable characters felt unique.  The game does seem to lean on the heavier side and can play long, so am unsure how many plays I can get it with nongamers.  Nonetheless, a good meaty game with a traitor mechanic.

One of my favourite games of all time this one.

Whats more, its not a euro game and my group really like it. Even the girls who arent much into scifi. Im an avid supporter of the show and loved how I could get them all to play it without worrying too much about spoilers. The mechanics allowing for the two teams of players to play off each other is great.

I just love this!  Every game is totally different, and I'm a fan of the hidden role/secret traitor mechanic.  I think BSG is hands down the best of this genre.

I first played this with no knowledge of the BSG series, and I still enjoyed it.  I think it's good enough to stand alone from it's theme, yet it has the best theme integration I've  seen.

RATING: N/A
Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game is a semi-cooperative game for 3-6 players ages 10 and up that can be played in 2-3 hours. Players choose from pilots, political leaders, military leaders, or engineers to crew Galactica. They are also dealt a loyalty card at the start of the game to determine if they are a human or Cylon along with an assortment of skill cards based on their characters abilities. Players then can move and take actions either on Galactica, on Colonial 1, or in a Viper. They need to collect skill cards, fend off Cylon ships, and keep Galactica and the fleet jumping. Each turn also brings a Crisis Card, various tasks that players must overcome. Players need to play matching skill cards to fend off the problems; skill cards that don't match hinder the players success. Fate could be working against the crew, or there could be a traitorous Cylon! As players get closer and closer towards reaching their Earth, another round of loyalty cards are passed out and more Cylons may turn up. If players can keep their up their food stores, fuel levels, ship morale, and population, and they can keep Galactica in one piece long enough to make it to Earth, the Humans win the game. But if the Cylon players reveal themselves at the right moment and bring down Galactica, the Humans have lost.

RATING: 7
One of [b][i]the[/i][/b] most thematic board games, considering how detailed this game handles and respects the source material of the TV show, but this aspect comes with certain pros and cons (see below).

I am very late to the party when it comes to this board game and the TV show of 2004. The first time I played this game in 2015, I had not watched a single episode of the show, but still immensely enjoyed this game and understood why it is so popular. Coming back to the game after having watched the first two seasons of the show, the experience was obviously even more enjoyable and immersive, as every little thematic detail and game design decision now made perfectly sense.

One thing I never liked about [b]Battlestar Galactica[/b] was the possibility that people can start loyal and become traitors later on during the game by a random card draw. Yes, this is again a very thematic design decision, but it always felt strange to me in terms of gameplay, making the game too random in this very critical aspect of the game. Additionally, paying close attention to what each player does makes less (to almost none) sense because of this delayed possible introduction of an additional traitor.

Another problem people can undeniably have is the game's length. This is one of those games spanning several hours that requires you and your board game group to plan ahead and schedule a certain time frame, depending on the number of players.

This game for sure would have been ranked higher by me (especially back when it came out and was new), but since [b]Dead of Winter[/b] was released in 2014 (which was obviously influenced by [b]Battlestar Galactica[/b], which again was influenced by [b]Shadows over Camelot[/b]), I always prefer bringing the cold zombie apocalypse of [b]Dead of Winter[/b] to the table, as it refined the mechanisms, streamlined the flow, has a shorter playtime and higher replay value, high-quality hand-drawn art and the right amount of humour.

If I wanted to sound harsh here, I could objectively say that the game is in comparison outdated.

[b]Closing words:[/b] The game is absolutely solid and good enough to be very enjoyable for people who never watched the TV show (like myself, see above). Having said that, if you have watched the first few episodes, the game's theme will really unfold for the players and make them realise just how well it is implemented, and I am sure that a lot of ratings and reviews are influenced by this factor of personal relation -- arguably rightfully so.

I would have objectively rated this game an 8/10 (or even subjectively higher as a fan of the TV series now), but since similar and more refined games have been released by now, I have to adjust it to a 7/10, which obviously still is a very high and well-deserved rating for this game. If only all movie-based and TV series-based board games would have this level of quality...

RATING: 8
Not much in the way of game, or meaningful decisions to be made, but can still be awesome fun with a group of players who get into theme. Definitely best played with 5 - not keen on the sympathiser mechanic which always ends up with a bit of meta-gaming on the part of the humans.

RATING: 7
Very good collaborative game that plays extemely well with the traitor mechanic. The rules are easy and intuitive, harder to explain than to understand after seeing them working. 

If its mark is not higher is because it needs the right group of people to play. I have played with two different groups, and, being a total blast for the first one, it turn out to be a bad experience in the second. More than for the game features, this fact depends of the tastes of every player.

BSG focuses on player interaction, forces players to be suspicious and to discuss every move in a desesperate atempt to catch cylon players (the traitors) before they can harm the human fleet enough to make the whole mission fail.  

To summarise, having a good experience playing BSG is closely related to playing with the appropriate group of people. If your grup doesn't like collaborative games with the traitor element, or simply they dislike having to discuss the moves of every player as the game goes by, you should avoid this game. Otherwise, it is probably the best amongst its kind. I would recomend it with no hesitation.

RATING: 5
I think I would need to play more if I want to know if I really enjoy this game. There are a lot of interesting mechanics to make sure  there can be sabotage and traitors in the crew without anybody knowing. The admiral and president mechanics are nice.

The only problem is that I did not feels like I had a control over the game. I also did not have the feeling of really beign on a space ship fulfilling jobs here and there.

First, there is so few actions you can do in a turn ( 1 action), and there is so many things happening in a complete turn. I would have made sure you could at least perform a location action and a card action. Second, you always have not enough cards in your hand. Since I was the last player, almost the whole first turn I got stock with no cards in my hand.

So I don't feel like I have really the power to help other crew members. Like "OK, we have this crisis, we lack of vipers and there is a base star ahead, what should I do. What are the priorities." There is no dressing a list of priorities and try to solve the problems.

I don't feel also that there is that much negotiation to do. There is a few, but I think there could be more.

So I don't know, I think I would have to play it again.

I played a second game, it could be summarized as thie: Great idea, bad implementation.

I strongly suggest you take a look at BSG Express because their core mechanic is much more better than this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I love the theme and TV show, and this is an excellent game as well.  The difficulty values are not scaled according to the number of players and this leads me to believe that 6 players is optimal for BSG with a slight variant (extra human card, which adds a little more doubt!).

You definitely have to approach this game knowing that it WILL be difficult for the humans to win and that it tends to favor the Cylons.  Interesting game tools with skill checks using different cards and values balanced against using them for their special ability.

The first ever game that I played and went "Wow, this is a 10". The whole game we were behind, we couldn't keep up and we were at a point were all of our resources were a cause for concern. I was betrayed, accused of betrayal, and betrayed again. It was amazing. I love the show, so I am probably biased, but I like to think that I would love this game even if I didn't. The game might be long but it is one of the best experienced I ever had.

Alle Spieler erhalten verdeckte Rollen. Ich hab natürlich gleich mal den Zylonen erwischt. Bloß nicht erwischen lassen. Atombombe gut platziert (das hätt ich auch als Mensch getan), Keinen Check versaut... vielleicht einfach zu gut für die Menschen gespielt. Habe mich kurz vor der zweiten Hälfte dann aufgedeckt, nachdem ich einen Check versaut hatte. Und dann gings Bergab mit der dreckigen Menschheit. Leider nicht schnell genug, sie sind mit noch ein paar hunderten auf die Erde gelangt.
Sehr schönes Spiel. Wir spielen es zu selten, daher fand ich die Menge an Regeln zu unübersichtlich. Das nächste mal dann bitte nur das reine Grundspiel oder Erweiterungen.

Das reine Grundspiel macht nicht so viel Spaß. Es macht tatsächlich Sinn wenigstens die Verfolgung von Exodus mit rein zu nehmen. Nach einem Sprung passiert erstmal überhaupt nichts und man weiß nicht was man mit seiner Aktion tun soll. So haben wir ständig Scouts riskiert und Kriesenkarten vorab angeschaut...

My particular game group loves this game.  We tend to really enjoy co-ops (myself excluded) and many of us are self-identified as "geeky", so the theme is appealing.  Unfortunately I do not love most co-ops and I am not a BSG fan.  However, this is a fun co-op game that involves "dirty" players, which always makes co-ops more fun.  My only complaint about this game is turns can take a long time and, thus, the game plays over a long time.  For me, if a game is long, the turns best be short, or vice versa.

This is the game I wish The Resistance was a lot of the time. The traitor mechanic is well-executed, and the turns actually flow fairly quickly, though there can be a fair number of them. The only place I get bogged down is when dealing with what the Sympathizer card actually means; its variable meaning depending on the player who gets it has made it confusing every time it's come up, and the fact that the card doesn't make it 100% clear what you're supposed to be doing now has caused more than one player to vapor-lock. Other than that, I highly recommend this to anyone who loves traitor mechanics or semi-cooperative play. (People who are obsessive about BSG canon should steer clear, though; this game does not attempt to be 100% accurate about who is a Cylon.)

Absolutely love this game. The player interaction is fantastic, and my friends and I have had absolutely sweeping victories and crushing defeats on par with the show.

I played this game with a group that were very pro-human and easy to read. It was immediately obvious who was the cyclon so I was put to the brig really quickly.

We still had an epic ending to the game and it was a very close call for human to win. 

I'm looking forward to try this game with more cylon agents. 

My recommendation for human players in the first round to not be so obvious. Takes away the fun for the cylons. :P

It was a bit long but great gaming experience. 

---------------
Update, played at 6 players yesterday.
Humans got owned. At more people the game definitely is harder for humans. 
It's also a lot more fun because the paranoia and suspicion is also a lot higher.

While the cylon having to balance sabotaging everyone's plans while remaining discreet is neat and there's some cool battle mechanisms, the hand management of placing cards to avert crises isn't that thematic to someone not into the Battlestar universe, and once the cylons have revealed themselves their options feel limited.

EDIT: I like the crisis cards more having finally played this game again. While I don't like that the game's length came be extended or shortened significantly based on how many warp symbols show up, The fact that they aren't always Dead of Winter's add cards to a pile but have some e.g. president choice too helps mix them up, and even when they are add cards to the pile the reveal cards that are played, change so that this color now counts etc. possible modifiers mixes things up. Also like that you just draw cards instead of having to spend half your actions searching like in Dead of Winter. 

However I am not a fan of the cylon attacks, as it requires significant amount of time rolling dice to see what gets hit, while not being a particularly unique form of combat. Also I feel knowing what is good to do is more opaque than Dead of Winter, where it is always good to search for items, which I think makes it optimally require all players be on a similar level of play (also if someone gets thrown in the brig).

The cylon mechanism I think works except I don't like how you can turn sides with no prior indication halfway through. Still think your options are a little bit more limited as a cylon.

This game I played took less than 2 hours and at that length it was enjoyable, but if was 3 as seems to be typical it would be too long for what it gives.

Don''t like the theme (spaceship and galaxy) but have to admit it is a better game than shadows over camorot. The rules is a bit more complicated and may take some time to pick up.
The voting system is a good mechanics, and bring good tension to the game.

A game that i''m interested in playing again :>

Great theme. The game really gives one the feeling of being in that situation - no matter if you are man or cylon. The one downside is that you mostly always do the same things onboard. One person normally does not have a lot of different things to do.

This is hands down, my favorite immersive thematic game. When you're playing BSG, you feel like you're actually a human fighting for your survival or a cylon trying to make them suffer. Everything, from combat to the characters to the crisis, is plucked straight from the show. And you can't just rely on seer views to determine who is evil. You have to fully get into character and assess whether or not the decisions people made were best for the fleet.

Also, I like the Cylon Fleet Board now.

Wow.  Love it, love it, love it.  First game tonight - a friend's copy.  First round was slow as we worked through the rules (and socialized, some non-hardcore gamers with us).  Game picked up quickly after Turn 1.  Hidden Traitor (or two) is so fun.  Bluffing and card counting for card players.  Much Paranoia for those familiar with the Paranoica RPG.  Dissent and accusations abound.  GREAT fun for a group of poker players.  Many of the same strategies w/bluffing, etc., but implemented in a fun new way.  Everyone who played is stoked for another go!

BSG is one of my favorite games. So simple yet so much can happen. I have about 20-30 plays of the base game and I could still play this game at any time. The expansion each add unique elements that I enjoy playing with.

For me the best game, with a hidden traitor. But it still doesn't convince me. Since you can become traitor in the midst of the game, you either may have worked all against you. Or you played to keep chances for both sides equal, till you know for sure. But then you could just as well have skipped the first half of the game.

[microbadge=419][microbadge=5792][microbadge=5389]

Battlestar Galactica is exciting.  Every turn is just another exercise of how much can be risked and who can be trusted, and the first time that more than two bad cards show up in a skill test, you just can't rely on anyone anymore.  (Unless you're the Cylon.  Then you're just a frakking skinjob who needs to save his ass before he's thrown in the Brig...)  Highly thematic and prone to series in-jokes while playing, the game actually works exactly as well with those who have never seen the show.  With fewer players, characters are more pressed to deal with the priority things happening, so some of the game's chrome, like piloting or using the Quorum, don't shine as well, so keep that in mind.

Too long for what it is.  I'd prefer a few games of The Resistance to one 3-hr slog through Battlestar.  Our last game took 4 hours...just to get to Jump #4.  Granted, there was some rules consultation and some players were distracted, ...but still.too.long.  It makes a war game like Dominant Species look short, which is a much more engaging experience to begin with.  A social deduction + co-operative game needs to be an hour or less in duration in my book.

FFG did a really fine job on bringing the show's theme to this board game. Covers series content from the mini to first half of season 2.

While I love this game, I would only play it with 5 players without the expansion. That's how broken the Sympathizer needed for 4/6 player games is, in my opinion. Brings in too much ridiculous metagaming.

RATING: 9
This is a magnificent piece of adaptation. What's most impressive about it is that it finds a way to make almost every significant plot element of the first few seasons of the show, from the food shortages to the vulnerability of raptors, and from Starbuck's bad temper to the President's illness relevant to gameplay. Because of this, even though it's extremely complex and fiddly, it's also remarkably easy to learn if you're already a fan of BG. Its one (very minor) shortcoming is that for the sake of fidelity to the plot, the designer has built it so that single, more or less random events can turn the tide of the game very quickly, in ways that players can't really do anything about. This makes it better suited for people who like their games to tell stories than it is for those who prefer a test of their strategic or tactical wherewithal.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I am told that my one play so far was an oddity in that nothing happened in the first half of this game.  The human characters went here and there around the ship waiting for enemies to show up, and when some finally did, the ship made a jump before any real harm came to pass.  The 2nd half showed a lot more promise as the tension ratcheted up, and I would definitely give this another try based on that.

An interesting corollary to Shadows. Some mechanics are not as well developed as others, and often enough the traitor is better off revealed. Of course, if the cylon fleet can't find the humans, there's not much for a revealed Cylon to do, in my opinion. Being a pilot is simultaneously boring and confusing. For all that, one has many more choices during their turn than in Shadows.

Hands down the best game released at GenCon and probably the best game released this year.  This game captures the feel of the series like no other game does for it's subject matter.  It feels like your playing thru the episode named "33".  I was lucky enough to be like the 10th person in line to get a copy of this.  

If you only played the demo and didn't get a copy to play a full game then you have not seen even half of the game.

RATING: 8
The game is a cooperative game with a traitor.  An event comes up each turn with the players and the players spend cards of various types to address those issues.  There is a usually a success and failure condition on an event.  

I own just the base game and there are some problems with the actions available to the Cylons.  It also really is optimized for 5 players.  4 player or less is too easy for the Cylons and 6 is too easy for the humans.  It can run very long with AP prone players and it will not typically finish in under 3 hours.  

It is a pretty great game is you can find gamers willing to put in the time to play it.  


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
What a game! Deception, trickery, manipulation and cunning all play their part in this fantastic game. This game really plays out the theme of BSG in an incredibly accurate way. Great components and artwork too. Although it greatly increases the length of the game, it definitely plays better with more as the accusations fly. Try to avoid playing this game with people that get easily distracted or people that are prone to analysis paralysis. The turns are meant to be thick and fast, and if you end up with an AP sufferer on your hands the game can take up to 5 hours which drags.

I am not a fan of coop games, but enjoyed the show.  My expectations were pretty low and somewhat exceeded.  It still seems like more of an activity like Werewolf than a game.

-- Great interaction element
-- This review (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/413645/a-perspective-from-someone-who-hasnt-seen-a-minute) although I cannot see when it would get played given the "CONS"
-- $24 at Borders w/40% discount applied!!
-- Fantastically recreates the feeling of the show
-- LOTS of tension and suspense as you are constantly analyzing who might be a cylon (see Tom Vasel's review)

CONS:
-- Very Long Game (2-3 hrs and sometimes longer). This is the killer UNLESS playing with people who are committed to a long game (maybe with older kids who have seen the show and WANT the full gaming experience in length and depth)
-- Boring board
-- Requires a high degree of commitment to being secretive about one's role

11/2010 Seems like a good game if you're familiar with the Battlestar Galactica series. If not, you're left with playing the game mechanics.  It's a collaborative game with a (potential) saboteur.  In our 4 player game it was easy to spot the saboteur after a few rounds observation, though not very much to do about it.

3/2012 Was lured into another game and, again, it just doesn't get me. Plain booring, lots of down time with pointing fingers and shouting "cylon".  And once the cylons are revealed there's really not very much to do about it.  Actually, the players havn't realy that much influence on the game at all.  The "Crisis" cards drive the game and you're just tagging along. Rating down 5 -> 3, sorry.

This is a hugely entertaining game of hidden identities that does a very good job of evoking the theme of the television series, and I've had a lot of fun particularly playing as a cylon. Still talk about some of the moments the game has produced for us *years* after they happened. One of my all-time favourites, though I haven't played it for some time now. I like the fact that the game is usually very difficult but not impossible to win as the humans, because that does a great job of recreating the tense atmosphere of the series on which it is based, and any victory you do manage as the humans is all the more memorable as a result.

I went to college with Corey Konieczka, the game's designer, so I may be biased, but I think this game is great. However, this is a bit like a role-playing game, in that it requires the players to immerse themselves in the the theme/story of the game. If played as an abstract, without the metagame of guessing the cylon, the game falls utterly flat. Fortunately, for our group, that doesn't happen.

BSG is a great thematic cooperative game with hidden identity, suspense, and backstabbing. Players must work together trying to pass critical crisis cards, save skill cards for later use, and try to determine which one of them is a traitor. One of the best TV-show adaptations to game, BSG truly translates all important aspects of the show to the game making it a very enjoyable experience.

The gameplay is shallow, repetitive and random. It should be sustained by meta-gaming by the players and adherence to the theme (I do not know the TV show, so it has no impact on me), but that doens't make it a game (let alone a good one).
And it is too long for what it offers (and the impact the die may have on the outcome).

RATING: 7.5
An excellent co-op with a traitor mechanic. The theme works really well and as a fan of the show, I really enjoyed our first game even though we had one Cylon (traitor) too many. The game might really start to shine after a few plays once everyone knows most of the multiple things that can happen in the game. Of course the surprise element is nice in first games as well.

 Logra copiar a la perfección las sensaciones y emociones básicas  de la popular serie  de TV del mismo nombre. La inclusión de un traidor y la sospecha constante introducen el estress, que a mi parecer, es el exito del juego.

RATING: 8
I love the theme, the gameplay is solid but this game is all about player interaction. Even people who have never seen the show and don't understand what is really going on their first playthrough love to shout "Cylon!" at each other with the rest of us. The only quibble is it can get a little long, especially if you use the expansions.

Own two expansions, not as good as it wants to be. To many mechanics and to much time for what you get out of it. Heavily dependent on the players.

Mafia incorporated in a boardgame. Love it! The late game, when cylons are revealed, isn't as exciting though. Should simply be played to see if they win, but if it goes on for too long, it's simply not worth it.

Gives me the depth I want from a hidden traitor game without an overdone theme (zombies in Dead of Winter).  Made me watch the show.  Would be higher but plays long.

RATING: 8
Gameplay:
+ simple, but solid mechanics
+ high level of tension and suspicion due to unknown traitors/cylons
+ randomized events
+ apealing mechanics for resource management and FTL jumps
+ very thematic; this game really captures what BSG is all about
+ simple rule variants are offered out of the box to adjust difficulty

- there could have been more choices of actions
- if not using the variants to adjust difficulty, the game favors the cylons; it is hard (but not impossible) for human players to win

Components:
+ very high quality components

- the game uses pictures from the TV-series; I personally would have preferred some nice artwork instead

Semi-cooperative game where you must suss out the Cylon in the group.  Plays remarkably like the show but some sessions are suspenseful and immensely fun while others are duds - cards play a major factor.  Seems like there is a bit too much chrome but that's OK given the close connection to the TV show.

This game is just brilliant. The way it turns best friends into total enemies really captures the show. 
Most players play as "not a cylon" where one or two players will be a cylon, where their objective is to sabotage the progress and wreak havoc. The game starts as blind accusation. Which leads to finger pointing and blaming. Which then leads to you getting all the blame for being a cylon even though its not and you know for a fact that its the person sitting next to you because he even looks like a toaster.

Love the hidden traitor, don't mind the game length.  The only thing is the action selections feel limited and there are very limited courses of action once the cylon has been revealed.  Expansions may help this.  Would love a Fantasy Flight "second edition" of this one.

One of the best implemented themes in a board game ever. If you've watched the first season of the series, this game feels exactly like that. There is constant pressure of food, water or fuel running out and the baddies are on your tail constantly. Add to that the traitor mechanism and you have a very exciting game.

They did mess up some things about the Cylons, though: apparently the Cylon player should reveal himself immediately to have the best chance of winning. Also, playing a revealed Cylon is very dull.

Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game is an exciting game of mistrust, intrigue, and the struggle for survival. Based on the epic and widely-acclaimed Sci Fi Channel series, Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game puts players in the role of one of ten of their favorite characters from the show. Each playable character has their own abilities and weaknesses, and must all work together in order for humanity to have any hope of survival. However, one or more players in every game secretly side with the Cylons. Players must attempt to expose the traitor while fuel shortages, food contaminations, and political unrest threatens to tear the fleet apart.

I'm skeptical to franchise-based games, but I've found this one to be fun and, in addition, that the gameplay cleverly evoke the feel of the television series.

The rules are somewhat complex but easy to get into. We were all able to make wellfounded decisions one round into the game, and in that first uninformed round it didn't seem like we could mess up to badly. Two of us had read the rules beforhand, four had not.

For me the collaboration and traitor mechanics work better in this one than in Shadows over Camelot. One of the traitor-players felt, however, that once he was revealed his options were a little less fun.

The time estimates are lies, of course, at least in regard to my friends: Our first game (six players) lasted for five hours, and then I don't count the rules explanation or the lunch break.

RATING: 9
One of my favorite games.  The best betrayal game out there in my opinion.  I love the mechanics of the hidden Cylon agent, secretly working against the rest of the crew of the Galatica and "twist" part way through the game where a human player finds out they were a secret Cylon.

The dynamics of trying to figure out who the Cylon and eventual Cylons are, all while trying to ensure the Galactica isn't destroyed and makes it to Earth is just fantastic.  Some of my fondest gaming memories are with this game and either convincing my friends I was on their side, all the while working against them and destroying the Galactica or being a member of the crew, figuring out who the Cyclon was and airlocking them.

The game throws a lot at the crew too, there's a crisis to deal with every round and they are legit crises, not bumps in the road.

It leads to a hectically fun, chaotically social gaming experience.

Somewhat preliminary still, but this seems to be a pretty balanced co-op game.  So far, the cylons are 2-2 in games in which I've played, so we'll see how good the play balance actually is.  It's one thing for the humans to be hopelessly outmatched.  It's another for the game to reflect that accurately.

This game was a blast. I immediately wanted to play again. I love the theme, and trying to discover who is the Cylon adds an incredible level of tension and excitement. It was a little difficult to teach from the rulebook (none of had played before).  Also, I think that being a fan of the show adds to the enjoyment. I do wonder if playing the game with someone who has never seen the show would be tough. Either way, I've seen the show and I think the game was awesome!

However, it really seems like you need the right group of people. If people aren't getting into the spirit of the game, then it is hard to have an awesome experience.

This has been a staple of Game Night for a long time now.  Although I don't see myself tiring of the game as long as I enjoy the people I play with (since it's the social aspect that makes the game), it doesn't get played with quite the frequency as before--I think the expansion will breathe a little more novelty into the game.

It's one problem is the running time. Unfortunately (unlike most games), I've found playing time doesn't drop with experience--sure people don't get fouled in mechanics, but debate fills up any time gained.

This is the game which brought me into modern boardgaming.

Altough it is not so simple, its theme and the hidden traitor mechanism effectively drags players into it.

After my first plays, I found myself dreaming of this game. I couldn't stop thinking about it and we played it on EVERY session.

I give it a 9 only because, after so much plays, I grew a bit tired of it. Also, it can be a bit lenghty.

I find it alarmingly easy to forget the rules of this game for some reason, but it's always fun when you do get a game going.  Since it's mostly cooperative, and no one CHOOSES to be the jerk player but rather has the game choose for them, it's all guiltless fun.  Suspicion, accusations, and "oh no!" moments abound.

Can occasionally drag on at the end, if a clear winner has made him- or herself known.  Also, could afford to be a little shorter.

A truly epic game! For a game that originates from a TV show, this game succeeds amazingly. Each game is tense and exciting, and each game experience is not only unforgettable, but a whole story in itself. Every character has a role to fulfill and does not feel like it's being added without reason. At its core, it is a game of interaction with lots of politics, betraying and surviving in order to achieve the end goal on each side. It does need the right gaming group to get the most fun out of it. But from all the buzz that it garnered since its launch, the game proves that it works for all types of gamers. For fans of the TV show, this is a no-brainer. Just get it and experience all 5 seasons of excitement in a 3-hour game.

This game wasn't for us for a lot of reasons. We primarily play two-player games, and this requires three minimum, but doesn't play well at that number. I think it needs a bigger group to shine.

It's too long for what it is. After two hours, the mechanics start to feel repetitive and fiddly, and the game still goes for an hour (or two!) beyond that. (I don't mind long games, but I do mind long, repetitive games.)

Overall, for the people I usually play with, it was going to be impossible for me to convince a big enough group to spend three to four hours playing a game about Battlestar Galactica. Even though I'm a huge fan of the show, that wasn't even enough for me to want to play the game. If I'm going to devote that much time to a game, there are other games I'd rather play.

High learning curve, very engaging semi-cooperative aspect. There will be traitors, but the traitors may not know who they are until halfway thru the game.

A deserved classic. We must have played this game well over a hundred times and never got bored. For a while we played it weekly with some friends. Personally I like it best with exactly five players as it's a straight up three humans vs two hidden cylons split, no faff with other types of character, but the balance created by those extra rules means it's a smashing game no matter what number of players you have. Except three. Three can get... nasty.

RATING: 7
This is a fantastic, sumptuous, involved game. It's lengthy without being long, and the way its interlocking mechanics combine to make it feel like the show -- right down to the bizarre situations (Lee, who is the President and the Admiral, gets thrown in the brig as Cylon sympathizer -- totally consistent, and happened in our first game) and the arc the humans follow (limping across the finish line, tossed from crisis to crisis) -- is sublime.

BSG isn't complex, but there is a TON going on at any one time, and a lot to keep track of. The banter around who is or might be a Cylon is delicious, and our first play cemented this one as a solid game.

This never hits the table, so it left my collection. Sold.

Being that I am a Cylon that could taint my view of the game.  Lies and deceit are beautiful things!

We seem to have found a sweet spot (for us).  Four players, cylon leaders, and the personal objectives.  Makes for a great hour to hour an half game.  Not too complex, but plenty of things to do.

BSG has a good mix of coop playing and treachery and doesn't test friendships as bad as Game of Thrones. Rule wise can be heavy for first timers but experienced players should be able to learn the game and tactics on the first playtime.
Usual play takes few hours and mostly the Cylon player(s) win the game. Playing/enjoying this game doesn't require knowing the story / watching the series as it hardly adds anything to the game (except some joking between players).

Rating based on 4 players.

Really liked this, and it perfectly evokes the TV series. I don't think 4 was the optimal number but it was still lots of fun, and playing with people I knew would just make it better as the accusations start to fly.

It does take a long time to play, however, and while all the rules make sense (particularly if you've seen the series), it is a bit overwhelming at first.

Maybe its that I haven't seen the show, but this game spikes my frustration levels like few things I've seen.  It doesn't seem hard....it seems hopeless!  I know its not. I know people who have beaten it, but as a human player this game makes me want to punch the cylon player.  Its bad.

An excellent combination of over-the-table paranoia and cooperative decisions! The game spontaneously creates fun and exciting stories of cabin fever, mutiny, accusation and unjust treatment of innocents. "Guilty until proven otherwise" fits the game well. Totally worth playing!

1.2.2014 Review: 8.5 -> 8.25 The slight drop comes from the overly long game length. The best parts of the game happen late in the game after 2-3 hours of playing time.

RATING: 8.5
This game is very much in line with my likes. 

It's thematic.  There's intense player interaction.  It balances logical skills (proving who threw what) with people skills (I just know he's lying now).  

The downside is that the mechanics can take some time to learn.  It's hard to teach mid-game when you might be on different sides.

Достаточно длительная и напряженная игра. Требует большой концентрации и внимания. Сильная сторона игры - кооперативные действия и борьба против игры, скрытых предателей. Интересный момент игры - скрытые предатели, которыми можно стать как в начале игры, так и в середине. Недостаток, это если кто-то начинает испытывать синдром "героя" и поступать основываясь только на личные предубеждения, теряется суть игры - кооперативное решение проблем.

My new favourite game. Coop with a traitor variant. Awesome theme tied deeply with the mechanics. The mechanics themselves bring out the rich theme. A must play for fans of BSG and even those who haven't seen an episode - you'll get hooked.. not only onto the game but also the show!

EDIT: Painted ships. They look great!

BSG!!!

That's all I have to say about that.  

Well I'll also note that sometimes its good to play a co-op game now and again.  Pretend we'll all friends and what-not.

Though the first time we played, one player decided to pretend to be an undercover Cylon... I was sure he wasn't prior to the second half and decided to go through the cards and showed him that I knew he wasn't.  I think what I said was "Either your a liar or a moron, which will it be?"  Some how even this game turned mean I guess...

Compelling gameplay, where you feel it will be unbalanced, but it never is. The game gets slow for colons without expansions. 

Box Insert: OK... lets get this, out of the way... so Fanstay Flight... you guys only know how to make one box insert for your full games... and even most expansions. one deep well which doesn't really hold the cards and two flapable wings to hide components isn't exactly a one size fits all solution. Battlestar is one of the most wounded by this. SO MANY PIECES, and nearly no sealable bags to put these components into. The one size fits all automatically brings this down by 4 points and the true miss with this game brings it down another 2... so a generous 4/10.

The best thing about Galactica is that the game is always different, when played with different players. There are not many games, which can give this to you. You are the only one who shapes the character you're playing. I didn't even played yet with all the characters and I don't own any expansions yet. I have this game for two years and its always fun to play it. Every game is different.

RATING: 8.5
Similar in it's basic idea to a game called Shadows over Camelot, Battlestar Galactica is a game wherein up to six players supposedly work together towards the salvation of the remnants of humanity, all the while knowing that there is at least one traitor amongst them.
The game is heavily themed and will appeal a lot more to fans of the series, but I've found that it still works wonderfully with people who know nothing of the Battlestar Galactica setting.

5 / 5 - Great

Very good game, which I found thoroughly immersive in spite of no being a fan of the TV show. Reading the rules - and the session reports - would seem to indicate this as a largely psychological game, but it isn't. There's a good amount of strategy for both sides to explore as well. So, tense, tactically challenging, highly interactive, very social .. what's not to like? Well, the rather repetitive nature of the skills checks and the fact that the game becomes rather less interesting once the cylons are revealed. The 100% co-op and solo variants from the publisher aren't great - don't buy the game on the strength of these alone.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This would be so much better if it didn't take so bloody long! Also the characters dictate too much where you'll spend basically all the game, maybe moving one place. In short, I'd rather pick basically The Resistance over this any time.

I played BSG and Shadows Over Camelot pretty much back to back.

RATING: 6
I could see this rating going up with more plays, but my first session wasn't stellar. I was Starbuck and a Cylon from the beginning, but wasn't able to sabotage the humans much because of her limited ability to acquire green/yellow cards. All of the crisis cards for the first half of the game were green/yellow/blue crises, so since I could only draw one of those per turn, I could only plausibly play one card per round of play without giving myself away. I managed to stay out of the brig, revealed myself at the half-way point of the game and danced around the cylon spaces until, with the help of my cylon buddy, the Galactica ran out of fuel. At least for now I think this game would be much more enjoyable as a human because then you feel the tension of not knowing who the cylons are. As a cylon there is no mystery, all you have to do is lay low until the time is right.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
In short, this is a beast. It's really hard to get to the table often and tough to teach new players what to do in their first game, so often the first game has to be carefully planned to avoid ruining the experience. I find Shadows over Camelot to be more forgiving.

With players who all know what they are doing this is a hard game to beat.

One of a small handful of games that virtually everyone can play, with only a few minutes worth of explanation, and have fun with.

RATING: 3
I love the theme and mechanics of this game!  It is so very immersive  and paranoia inducing.  The tension is palpable right from the start as you try to figure out who the traitorous cylon(s) hiding amongst the humans is/are.  Every move every player makes is under heavy scrutiny.  If you're a human you feel like you must defend every decision you make and if you're a cylon you feel like everyone must know.  The game is fantastic in these regards.

Where the game comes off the rails for me is the incredible amount of time it takes to play through.  Games I've played run into the 5 to 6 hour range.  This is almost the length of a workday!  I don't play games to go to work, I play to have fun and move on to the next thing.  So, as much as I love the theme and appreciate the mechanics I can't bear to play this game again.

RATING: 8
Very long and heavy (always play with short game variant found on variant forums!!! otherwise it's way too heavy - unless uou are able to plan whole Saturday/Sunday around this game, then go wild), but otherwise seems to improve the traitor aspect of Shadows over Camelot. Days of Wonder does great components but so does FFG, and come on, it's BSG. It's so heavy though. For traitor element only, Resistance is the better choice, but Battlestar Galactica is a lot deeper experience (even if you haven't seen the show, if you have it becomes the best tie-in game you've ever seen!) where being a traitor matters more.

2-Player Comment:
*Variant forums has decent 2p variant. But it's really missing the most fun part of the game, so it's mostly good for learning or if you are HUGE BSG fans and can't get more. Don't buy if you want a 2p or 3p game! 4p can be good with cylon leaders but 5 is where it becomes great

Expansions:

RATING: 9
Interestingly I was not a BG fan until my game group insisted I watch just enough episodes so I would have the background on this game. I watched the first three episodes and then we played. This is now one of my favorite games. It requires team work and sometimes keeping a poker face when you are a cylon and don't want anyone to know. The one drawback to this game is that it takes a lot of time to play. Our group has to be ready for an early start to our game playing when we are planning to play BG.

Les extensions ne sont pas indispensables, le jeu est équilibré tel quel.

Variantes à tester : 

Préparer le paquet crises "à la Pandémie". Mettre 2/3 des attaques cylons de côté, mélanger le 1/3 restant avec les crises. Faire des paquets de taille équivalente (autant que d'attaques mises de côté), et mélanger 1 carte attaque dans chaque. Empiler le tout.
https://boardgamegeek.com/article/23640913#23640913

Un cylon qui se révèle (et seulement à ce moment là) choisit sa carte super crise parmi 2 piochées au hasard.

Un effet qui dit d'endommager le Galactica ne peut pas cibler le Pegasus. Quand un basestar attaque, il tire 2x. Une fois sur le Galactica puis une fois sur le Pegasus.

Good: 
Hidden role traitor game in a Battlestar Galactica setting. 

The game uses screen grabs of characters, scenes and objects from the show, which looks good and works really well for the theme. 

Bad: 
This game is way too slow and way too long for my tastes. 

The card-play (main gameplay mechanic) just isn't engaging. 

The difficulty to win/lose is greatly influenced by the luck of the draw. It feels very lame to get a few crappy drafts toward the end of the game and have it suddenly swing to being unrecoverable due to that.

I had to downgrade my rank of this game recently because, despite the fact that it was one of the first modern games I purchased for myself, the fun factor of the game is too highly dependent on the group makeup. Additionally, the random nature of having 0, 1, or 2 cylons at the beginning of the game drastically (and negatively) affects the effectiveness of any strategy for either side.

I will still play this whenever I get the chance.

This so fired Shadows Over Camelot. The best semi-coop (traitor type) game out there. But, if you aren't familiar with the show you'll be missing something in the theme.

I have played this game a number of times and feel a rating of 8.5 is well deserved. You don't have to be a fan of the TV series to enjoy this game (I've never seen a single episode!) and there is enough in the text and story during game-play to get engrossed in it's world and characters. I enjoy the co-operative nature of play with the other players while you struggle to make decisions to protect your ship and eventually get you home. There is a lot of player interaction (from sniffing out cylon sympathisers, voting on tests and co-ordinating attacks) and intrigue that goes on that is a much as part of the game as the cards and dice-rolling. Definitely give it a try!

After reading about gameplay, I am dead sure that this will be a nine or even ten in my ratings.
(FFG really should raise Corey K's salary, I think) :)

A first playtest in Essen plus a play later confirms my initial high rating of 9.5 (well, almost).
I have to subtract 0.25 because of the damage table just being in the rules and the texts on the board just being in one direction (why not writing them twice in both directions, why not adding the table twice on the board?). The sympathizer mechanic with 4 or 6 players sometimes may be a bit boring for the sympathizer - another .25 have to go. Still a strong game I want to play again as soon as possible.

RATING: 7
Sweet semi-cooperative game, although I've also found it to be punishingly difficult for the humans most of the time. The entire concept works better than I thought it would, and it's ultra faithful to the spirit of the show. Looking for the traitor(s) is exciting and the paranoia that the game creates is very real. There comes a point where you feel you need to rely on your co-players but the reality sets in that you really can't count on them to help you win the game when they start to act suspiciously.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The one problem I have with this game is that if players don't know in advance about the importance of fuel, that decides the game all by itself, which is annoying. There's basically enough fuel for the humans to EXACTLY finish the game; if the humans pick "lose fuel" on an choose-your-fate event even once, their odds of winning are about one in four. That's just stupid.

The only other issue is that the number of players makes for a dramatically different game. The four-player game (where two people are almost always Cylons) and six-player (where three people are almost always Cylons) is dramatically different from the five (where humans have an advantage in numbers every time).

I'm still convinced we're doing something wrong in this game.  The Cylons are just way too strong, and the game loses any entertainment value as soon as the second Cylon comes out.  I still need to investigate the rules further, but right now, I'd much rather play Betrayal at House on the Hill, Shadows over Camelot, or Last Night on Earth.

I've really had a good time playing this game.  I love the tense moments when the raiders are surrounding your ship and your morale and food are low and you're just about to jump but you have to pass this last skill check and OH MY GOD NOW'S THE TIME THAT THE CYLON REVEALS?!?!?!?  It's so intense and fun.  The downside is the long set-up and play time... we only can play this once every few months.  It's well worth the wait though!

Our houserules:

Shorter Game Variant:
Sleeper Phase at 2, Final Jump ready at 6. 
(9 Pop, 7 Morale, 7 Food, 7 Fuel)
6 damage to destroy BSG.
Can't lose by running out of raptors

Sympathizer Variant (4 and 6 player games):
Remove sympathizer role;
4 player game: 2 cylons (1 in sleeper phase).
6 player game: 3 cylons (1 or 2 in sleeper phase).
Double the value of the highest matching skill card in each check. 
Last cylon has NO option to reveal.

Revealed Cylon Variant:
No Cylon Reveals before sleeper phase.
When a Cylon reveals, discard to 3 skill cards and take an extra "Not a Cylon Card" loyalty card (to use with the ressurection ship).
Revealed Cylons draw ONE skill card each turn and can not play special abilities from cards or from their character sheet.
A player in a viper or raptor can reveal as a Cylon to attack friendly ships but the Cylon card ability can not be used for the rest of the game. The BSG is considered a basestar if attacked this way. If shot down, you go to the ressurection ship instead of sickbay.

Increased Cylon Attack Variant:
Randomly remove 7 regular skill check cards from the crysis deck for more cylon attacks.

At the final jump phase, spawn the following:
Sector 1: 1 Basestars, 4 raiders
Sector 2: 1 civ ship
Sector 3: 1 civ ship
Sector 4: 2 Heavy Raiders
Sector 5: 1 civ ship
Sector 6: 1 civ ship

FTL Jump Variant: 
For early jumps, the admiral only chooses the top destination card (-1 destination card). He may still jump to a destination from a pilot's reconnaissance mission. 

Damaged FTL drive:
If the FTL drive is damaged, BSG may not jump. If the marker reaches autojump, it remains there but no jump is made.

Scout Card Variant: 
- becomes "recon mission" no need to roll

Raptor variant:  
Any card or action that says "Viper" also refers to a "Raptor".

Raptor Abilities:
Recon Mission (Action - Manned Raptors):
Draw the top destination card and keep in your hand (secretly). When the next jump occurs, a pilot with a destination card can suggest a card to jump to. If the admiral trusts the pilot, the BSG jumps to this destination and the destination card is revealed. After a jump, the recon cards are reshuffled into the deck.

Jamming Signals:
Each friendly raptor gives a defensive reroll for the human side in their sector.

FTL Drives:
Raptors have their own FTL drives and can jump for recon missions and can jump along with the BSG. When the BSG jumps, clear the board but keep the raptors in space.

Combat:
(Defense)
Damaged on 5-7, Destroyed on 8. (same as vipers but vipers are attacked first)
(Offense)
Unmanned: Can not attack
Manned: Hits anything on a 6-8

Additional Houserules:
Civ ships are flipped (public knowledge)
Civ ships with no resources cause BSG to lose -1 morale

Changes to Cylon Locations:
Human Fleet: steal 2 cards instead of 1
Ressurection Ship: Give ONE of your loyalty cards to another player (can't be used during final jump phase - distance 6+).

Notes: 
A damaged basestar can be replaced by a new one if there are no more in the supply.
The skill card discard pile is facedown.
The command location can be used to activate 1 viper/raptor two times.
A pilot in space can be sent to the brig unless they are a revealed Cylon.

Horrible, just horrible.  Why would anyone play this?  

Stated for fact, "if this didn't have the BG theme, the fanboys wouldn't be out in force...it's rating would be much, much lower."

Once you get passed the theme, there is no "there" there.

A favorite with our gaming group. While not a huge fan of the expansions, I love the base game simply because it has great mechanics and gameplay. Huge amount of Euro tropes (worker placement, auctioning, etc) but also dice rolling (space combat, weapon firing, FTL use, diplomacy, speech-giving). Add in the hidden traitor elements and to me you have a perfect game. Who cares that it takes two hours?

I enjoy the game and the flavour of the show, if played with fans it really shines, but it would work with non-fans as well. Co-op isn't my preferred genre, but I find this one enjoyable, though potentially time consuming. One advice for people introducing new people to the game; let all players see and read all potential affiliation cards before they are shuffled up and handed out. My first time playing the game I did not have enough time to read my cylon affiliation card and for half the game had no clue how to play the role.

A well-designed game with solid mechanics and a few really neat ideas, and everything is excellently melded to the theme. With the right group, the table talk can be really fantastic, and so the game can be a great social experience.

I can't say that it's a [i]great [/i]game. It's longish and getting tossed in the brig is a potential fun-killer. I'm also not a big fan of the television show, and it can get repetitive. The lack of variety in the cards is a sticking point. But it's definitely good to very good and worth replaying several times as different characters.

I've never been a Cylon, so I can't speak to the funishness of that, and I've never played with an expansion. Boomer is the best character to play. Don't argue with me on that one.

Battlestar has yet to lose any of its luster after quite a few games of playing, and its basic incarnation (without Pegasus) is so well put-together we have friends begging to play at times.  I have never played a game that captures the feel of a TV show (or movie) as well as this one.  Paranoia and conflict abound with punctuated moments of respite fed by a near-constant feeling that you've nearly lost the game.  The traitor mechanic is also very well thought out and adds a ton of replay to this game.  In its basic (non-Pegasus) form it is the absolute best semi-co-op game I've ever played.

I definitely enjoy this one, although I don't quite get all the moving parts. One beef I have is that it can run very long. Another beef is that some of the ship spaces are barely used in some games.

Played this for the first time at SnowCon with both the Exodus and Pegasus expansions. Keep in mind that I'm not a fan of the TV series. (I think I watched two episodes total.) I really, really, really enjoyed this game. Granted it was the last game that I played at the Con and I had just come off a long stretch of playing Euros. I found this to be a refreshing, intense change of pace! With both the expansions the game in at a 9.5. I'm docking it .5 points from a potential perfect 10 because I don't dig the theme. But fan of the series or not, this board game is worthy of being in your collection.

RATING: 5.5
The theme is pulled off extraordinarily well and the designers used the BSG license to it's fullest.  It's Cylons versus humans but the Cylons are initially hidden within the human population.  Table-talk and play that inspires trust but leads to accusation, second-guessing and poor decisions is going to help the Cylons undermine the human efforts from within their ranks. 

The game relies on an engine to help keep the balance between the two sides.  A fluky disaster card-draw or even an early-guessed reveal can throw off this balance.  Like most cooperative games there isn't a lot ONE person can do on their turn.  So you'll need to really help everyone with the decisions presented to them each turn.  This can be frustrating for a revealed Cylon player who at times is going at it alone with not many choices ahead of him.  For me BSG only seems to have about 5 plays in it before it becomes too samey.  Perhaps this can be changed by bringing different personalities to the table.  If you're like me, not much of a table-talker and even less a manipulator you're probably going to be a generally weak player compared to others.

UPDATE: knocked down a half point because it seems to be either too hard or too easy.  Additionally the 3-4 hour play time is 1-2 hours too long for such a repetitive game.

likely very group dependant, but i think this is a very well done "co-op" with a traitor(s).  i have not seen an episode of the tv show and had no trouble picking up the gist.  does a stellar job of pacing (sometimes slow, sometimes frantic, sometimes back to slow, and it does reach a crescendo) and creating intrigue (better than Shadows unless you play with the 0-2 traitor variants with 6 or 7 people).  great experience and leads itself to retelling stories of games down the road.

needs at least 4, and shines with 5.  would not ever play with the sympathizer and prefer the official variants.

RATING: 5
Predictably, this is nowhere near my sweet spot, but I'm glad I played, even accounting for extreme lengthiness. The rules were easy enough to grok, especially considering how many there are, but their consequences are not. So I'm sure that if you're into that kind of thing, repeated play would pay off. Interesting enough twist on the co-op genre, although perhaps too limiting in the actions one can perform within a given role - even though there are a  lot of options, I didn't feel like I had a lot of options. In the right circumstances, I'd play again.

I understand why fans of the show are delirious over this game, but as I never watched *any* episode I think the game takes far too long for what it is. I enjoyed the experience, but I rather play *a couple of* games of Resistance or The Thing in the same amount of time.

The mother of all deceptive competitive games! Played it a ton when first came out. Whether you are "Death to all Humans" or "Kill all the Cylons". What makes it so fun is the possibility you may switch from human to Cylon during the game. As well as trying to be a hidden Cylon destroying the Humans without being discovered. Base game is great. Pegasus Expansion also great. But hard to teach newbies. Best with experienced players, esp. 6.

RATING: 7
I felt that this game was just a bit too long. Early on things progress along at a reasonable rate but then as the cylons are revealed less crisis cards are drawn and so the movement of things like the jump track slow down. For my view we'd got to the point where the chance of human survival was very low but the final knock-out blow took such long time to be delivered that it just seemed that we were going through the motions. We still weren't certain goners but it did feel that it took too long to find out if we'd pulled one out of the bag or if the cylons would have their way.

However the traitor mechanic does work very well in this game with the paranoia ramping up as players can't work out who the cylon is but suspected various other players. Is the player denying vociferously doing so because they are actually a human or because they are only trying to convince you that they are human? Did that player do that because they really thought it would be the best move or were they hoping that the dice would help the cylon cause?

Draft actions and pass cooperative skill checks to save humanity from the cylons/destroy humanity.

Plays: 1.
Type: Thematic cooperative game – a theme-driven game where you play together against the game.
Complexity: Heavy cooperative game.
# of players: See BGG.
Playing time: See BGG.
Player interaction: Cooperation. Misdirection. Some targeting of other players.
Randomness: High – dice and card draw with high impact and little control.

Replayability: Not so high. It’s a long and very random game. Your actions have little impact. The outcome mostly depends on how many cylons there are and what crisis cards are drawn, which is entirely random. I guess you don’t play this game to win, but to enjoy the ride. Those that enjoy the ride will probably want to play again.
Fun: Not so much. The urgent sense of inevitable doom can be fun. Destroying cylon ships with nukes and in space combat is fun. Figuring out who is a cylon sounds like fun, but this was the biggest let-down for me. The cylons played exactly like humans until they could get a big pay-off from revealing themselves and then did. There was no sense of increasing paranoia, just a “ok, so he’s a cylon”. Meh. 
Memorability: High. This creates a story about humans and cylons. You’re playing your opponents as well as the board, which increases memorability.

Thematic integration: Very good. This is designed theme first. The theme is very cheesy, which I guess can act as a deterrent to trying the game.
Components: Good. A quality game.

Who will like this: Gamers that like the theme and play for the experience more than for the outcome.

Oh, BSG. As a fan of the show, I enjoy you very much. As a guy who wants to play more than one game in an evening, you frustrate me. This remains my favorite hidden traitor game, and with the right group this game is an unforgettable evening. However, it can be overwhelming to non-gamers, and unfortunately it really only takes one player not buying into the game to derail it. Still a favorite, but one I'm becoming more hesitant about.

Really fun game. Helps if you are familiar with Battlestar Galactica but there is enough there that even if you aren't a fan of the show you will still enjoy it. The game has a lot of replayability due to the variety of the characters you can play.

Actual play time is kind of long, but you don't feel it. Both our games, one with 4 players and the next with 6 players, took about 4 hours (including teaching.)

Whenever I play BSG, I always feel like I didn't get *quite* enough entertainment for the time spent on it. It's as if a fun 90 minute game somehow got trapped in the body of a 3-hour behemoth. Too much downtime, too many one-sided decision points, and after 3 hours of time investment, the whole game can end on the throw of a dice/unlucky card flip...

This is the game that got me into the hobby. Being a huge fan of the theme I knew this would resonate with me. This is the kind of game that my friends and I dedicated a whole day to, between breaks and accusing each other of being toasters, we always have an enjoyable time. In my opinion, this is one of the best matches of theme to mechanics that I have seen.

You could easily rate this game a 4 if you spend it all in the brig. The game can be a walk in the parc for the humans if no Basestars show up before other launches.

Beginners are definitely at a disadvantage, since you can't ask some questions (for example if a player asks "how do you declare yourself a Cylon" you can guess he is probably a Cylon).

RATING: 10
Bought ding n' dent from CSI at Gen Con for $31. Kat bought this, I bought Pegasus.

This game is a blast with a good group of players. Distrust, deception and betrayal are heavy themes in the game. Some metagaming is inevitable with this game, and the worse the group is about metagaming the more the game suffers in my opinion. For example, if you're a cylon you need to be careful about how long you look at your loyalty card and make sure not check it again later, because if you're checking your loyalty card, it obviously says more than "You are not a cylon."

With a good group, it's an enjoyable way to spend 2-3 hours. Playing as a cylon (which I've done in 4 of my first 5 plays) is challenging and enjoyable.

I was already getting diminishing returns from Shadows Over Camelot, and I think BSG has made that game obsolete. In the rare instance that I have the proper players and time, I can't see picking Shadows over BSG.

11/7/09: I'm torn.... On the one hand, I love the political interaction of this game.  Just today, the action of checking out a player's loyalty cards (as Baltar), seeing that he's Cylon, and then trying to convince the others --- it's just wonderful.  On the other hand, I've played three times, and each time the humans have lost in a long, drawn out, and seemingly inevitable assault by Cylon forces.  The player interaction is great; the endgame less so.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
So much more psychologically intense than Shadows Over Camelot. For some reason I always end up a cylon.

My ONLY concern is that of the five games I have clocked, the humans have NEVER won (possible game balance issues?)

Favorite character to play: Chief Tyrol! (who is also my favorite character on the show.)

Edit: Humans won today, and with me as the Chief! It was excruciatingly close, and the cylon player did the best double-cross backstab I've seen in the game so far. Updated rating of this game to nine. I am at a point now where, if we have exactly five, I almost prefer this to any other game.

This game coined a new phrase in our gaming group: "evilgasm." As in, "Convincing you to executive order me so I could reveal myself as a cylon, blow up half of Galactica, and cause you guys to lose the game just game me a massive evilgasm."

------------

Ratings revised after many, many game of the Resistance. The theme here in BSG does not hold the interest it once did, and the traitor mechanic and all the arguing and treachery that makes it pleasurable is handled just as wonderfully in Resistance without the three hour play time.

Excellent game that in truth is held together by it's cylon edge. Highly recommended for 4-5 players. I used this game to convert non gamers who now always want to be invited to games nights. We allow secret messages to be sent (to only 1 person) at the end of each round. It's funny to read them after the game ends and the whole note passing thing adds to the paranoia. Only problem we have with the game is the sleeper agent (2nd cylon). The rules are a bit awkward on this point and it can make the game nigh on impossible for the crew to win. To be fair to it this games not about winning or losing, it's about the great talking point's you will laugh about for a long time afterwards. Great game.

I love, love, love BSG the series.  Recently it ended and I'm still having withdrawal pangs.  It's like breaking up with an old lover (okay, so I've never really had an old lover, but I'm sure if I did it'd be just like not watching BSG).  Anyway, love the series, and the game definitely evokes some favorite moments from the show.  Plus I get to do my Colonel Tigh (even when I'm not Colonel Tigh).  But by the Lords of Kobol, does it have to be so long?  Can Fantasy Flight make a game that doesn't take FOUR HOURS to play?

I would say this is one of the best, if not the best, boardgame adaptations of any TV series.  However, that is not saying too much as most of the stock are pretty pathetic.

Based on 3 plays.  So far Cylons have won every game.  It is fairly fun if you are a Cylon, as long as you're not revealed too early.  But otherwise I'm not sure what makes it such a great game.  Nothing incredibly novel about the mechanics.  But overall I've had fun with it.  Most of the tension is around the question of Cylon or not.  It does go a little long, but if it's a tense game you don't mind too much.

After 5 plays.  It's wearing a little thin with me.  The last two times I was a Cylon and we lost, probably because I tried to stay unrevealed too long.  It's just that it's kind of boring if you're a cylon.  It seems you can win too easily just by revealing and playing bad stuff.  But there's almost nothing for you to do between turns.  Lame.  I think it's a much more interesting game if you're a human.  But if you're not then you just have to wait out a longish 3 hour game which means you can't play other games you might have enjoyed more.  The next couple plays will probably keep me interested in a game now and then, or turn me away for good.  If I become a cylon, and can find a more interesting way to play it, or if I become a human and feel like I have a fighting chance.

Muy conseguido, juego muy divertido y que no defrauda.

Excellent game with shades of Diplomacy-meets-Red November.

The BSG theme is thoroughly integrated throughout, but the game is involving and well-explained enough that players need not have seen the TV series. Players who have, however, will better appreciate some of the flavour text.

The box suggests '3-6 players', but I would not recommend playing with fewer than 4.

Yet another co-op game with tons of theme but a game mechanism that is either brutally agressive (when Cylon battlestars are present or Cylons have revealed themselves) or plain boring (when none of the above is happening). Tons of possibilities and different cards tend to slow down the game and in the end you wonder if your choices really do influence the outcome.

One positive note on the voting mechanism which is really fun and has a lot of tension but after laying down cards for the X-th time, this also looses its tension.

Fun if you are a fan of Battlestar Galactica, might be fun if you are a co-op fan. Otherwise don't bother.

I thought my wife was a cylon, she was sure that I was, my friend was on the fence about it...turned out his wife was the cylon!

Great game...only slight problems are a bit too much downtime for first time play and the sympathizer-mechanic could use a bit of tweaking.

Rating is after only one trial solo play. Looks like a very well done game, but may run a little long to be rated higher. It all depends on how players feel after playing. I.e. will they think, "Has it been that long?", or "Wow, that took a long time." More plays will tell.

Upped rating to 10. Everyone I've introduced BSG to has absolutely loved it. Even though it still takes three hours to play, we can't get enough of this game. Definitely a superior execution of the semi-cooperative genre.

RATING: 3
Yet another boring co-op. I wanted to like this game, but it suffers from all the same issues as most co-op games. Primarily, playing a co-op board game feels like trying to paint a portrait by committee. Deciding things in a game by group discussion is as boring as sitting through a meeting at work. The decisions are either blatantly obvious, or a crap shoot with regard to outcome. Either way, I don't feel like I have any skin in the game, and I quickly become bored. The traitor mechanic is a nice try, but all it does is turn it into a guessing game, which is just yet another game mechanic that bores me silly. The only time I enjoy guessing and trying to read my opponents is when it's distilled down to a fast-playing filler game like Skull, Liar's Dice, or better yet, Coup. [Update: Reverse that order. Coup sucks. Skull rocks. And Liar's Dice is still the boring middle.] Anything longer than that, and guessing just becomes a tiresome chore. I could easily cut and paste this comment and apply it to several dozen other co-op games with traitor mechanics, but I'm putting this here only because I actually own a copy of BSG.

Update: Sold.

The first half of the game (when not a cylon) feels a bit ho-hum.  Turns can be slow and there's a lot of downtime.  The first half investment really pays out in the second half, however.  After the cylons are revealed, the game gets much more tense & personal: you really do want to win and make that final jump.  After every game, I feel pumped and excited - what a great experience!

A light game which doesn't need a lot of thinking but requires a lot of player to player interaction. A faithful representation of Battlestar Galactica theme and feel.
It's roleplaying and it's semicooperative. And yes you must talk a lot during this game and convince your friends you're not cylon eventhough you're one! The game is cunning and has a beautiful mechanics(which is surprising as it is trying to be a representation of a tv series) The rules are easy to remember and understand.

My first play of this is still my favorite. It's the reason I watched the new Battlestar Galactica! Tensions and paranoia were high for one of the most consistently fun gaming sessions I've ever had. That being said, the "game" part of this is pretty flimsy. It all comes down to player interaction, bluffing, blaming, and attempting to deflect that blame. If there aren't these kinds of interactions, the game ends up being rather dull.

Played twice - once as human, once as cylon. I like the game a lot. The reveals of the cylons have generally surprised most players and both games have been close at the end, although in both cases the humans lost. But I think this is the correct difficulty level, as I don't like co-operative games where it is too easy to win.

Play only with 5.  It says it goes 3-6, do not believe it!  At 5 the game is tense, exciting, paranoid, and rough.  With three it's too few to be great and with 4 or 6 the balancing is off. 

While it is a little on the long side, it's a wonderful treat.  Cylons seem to have an advantage at first, but once the humans learn how to work together it becomes a tight game.

A nice, rich hidden traitor(s) game that must be played with a large group and with a long playtime. 
Some newer designs (like Dead of Winter) have surpassed this old gem somewhat, for us, but it's still a meaty beast.

Alas, Italian edition (by EG) is a mess and totally unplayable if not overly patched...

Rate: --- (can't rate it, really)

After one play, I like this one quite a bit.  Game design is perfect for the theme, lots of suspense and just quite a bit of fun.  One of the better new-to-me games that I've played in quite a while- it's making me want to seek out more Ameritrash.

Don't get stuck as a Cylon.  Holy crap that was the worst when I got outted as a Cylon and spent the rest of the long game moving the fleet one space with my Cylon buddy.  What a drag.

Battlestar Galactica ist eine einzigartgie Spielerfahrung. Auch wenn die Spieler zusammen arbeiten müssen, herrscht ein ständiges Misstrauen untereinander. Die Thematiken der Serie z.B. die einzelnen Charaktere wurden perfekt in das Brettspiel integriert. Aber selbst wenn man die Vorlage nicht kennt, ist Battlestar Galactica ein unglaublich tolles Spiel. Wie schon gesagt ist es ein Semi-Kooperatives Spiel, denn es kann einen Zylonen in den Reihen der Spieler geben. Anders als in anderen Spielen mit einer "Verräter"-Mechanik, kann der Zylonenspieler manipulieren und sabotieren und trotzdem sehr lange unentdeckt bleiben (zumindest wenn er klug spielt). Dann aber entstehen unglaublich spannende Partien, die im Gedächnis bleiben. Battlestar Galactica muss man gespielt haben!

Brilliant game.  Definitely best with 5 but still great with 4 or 6.  Everybody needs to be invested in the game for it to work.  

Downgraded to an 8 because it doesn't see the table often enough and it's perhaps a bit too long for what it is. Very difficult to keep all players interested. It's still a fantastic game, but these days i'm more likely to play Dead of Winter.

Only complaints with the base game:  (1) There are random periods where there's not much to do because there's no cylon ships around, and (2) there are also droughts where crisis cards don't have the "jump" symbol, making progression impossible.
Update: Bought the Exodus expansion. We always play with the Cylon fleet board now. My group actually plays this game often, even if it's a bit long. Our only issue with the game (besides playtime) is #2 above. We feel like it's too difficult for humans to win.

Egy ízig-vérig 'ameri' játék: a sorozat hangulata, eseményei, főbb szereplők és azok jelleme tökéletesen átjön a játékból, a pedig kocka rendkívül fontos eleme a játéknak.
Az első pár játékban csak sodródtunk az eseményekkel, szükséges, hogy alaposan megismerjük a helyszínek akcióit, a szakértelem kártyát akcióit, de ugyanilyen fontos, hogy tudjuk, mit veszthetünk egy-egy ugrásnál az uticél pakli miatt. Ez miatt kell egy kis kitartás, hogy megkapjuk a játéktól a sikerélményt.
A partik általában lassan indulnak be, de kb. a felétől nagyon felpörög a játék, onnantól lesz valódi küzdelem, vádaskodásokkal, stratégiák ki- és átgondolásával.  
Pár játék az alapjátékkal és jöhetnek a kiegek: az Áruláspakli, a meglévő szakértelempaklik kiegészítései, az új kiegészítőtáblák, az új karakterek mind mind - a sorozat tematikáját megtartva - mind-mind hozzátesznek a játékélményhez. Az egyes kiegészítő dobozok a sorozat egyes évadaihoz kapcsolódó lehetőségeket hoznak a játékba,.Mindegyikkel kapunk egy-egy, az adott évadhoz kapcsolódó végjátékot is, kinek melyik tetszik.

BSG? Stands for Boring, Shallow Game.

Draw some coloured cards, play some coloured cards, sit and watch everyone else do it for 20 minutes whilst blindly hurling accusations of betrayal for every action they make. Repeat. Carry on for 3-4 hours.

I go in really hoping to get to play that amazing "Best Coop game ever" that the 17 pages of 10 raters seem to be playing, but it's just not there.

It's dull, painfully long, repetative and just not very interesting. Without knowledge of the TV show this is just a wishy washy sci-fi non-gamers game. Be warned however that BSG fans will remain completely oblivious to this fact and act like it's the best thing since sliced bread.

I've had a huge amount of fun with this, even though I have not gotten a group that has figured out how to make humans win.  Also wind up being a Cylon most of the time, which is annoying, because I want to make humans win for once.

Seems to be a good intro game, as people seem to get the hang of the rules by the end of the first game and are always itching to play again.

Brilliant game - I love it!  I like it becuase it is  heavily themed, each character is unique, and every game is different dependending on who you play with and who the Cylons are. For a bunch of gamers - this game is superb! For some non-gamers it is too complex and too long. The theme also puts some people off, particularly some of my female friends.

The designer has done a great job of capturing the essence of the re-imagined TV series.

A non-stop onslaught of ill fortune, foreboding and "who did that?" like predicaments that you face alongside your fellow players.  It Provides an interesting juxtaposition whereby the game has you playing a highly immersive co-operative game, while at the same time being unable to fully trust or rely on anybody but yourself...assuming you are playing as a human that is.

RATING: 8
A great Co-Op game with traitor, this is a long game (2-3 hours) and super complex for beginners. Once you have a grasp of the game mechanics however it's a surprisingly fun game. My only gripe with this game is that it can feel a little dull when you are not being attacked by Cylons. The flip side to this is that its very chaotic for the Humans once the Cylons are ousted and openly attacking you.

Konieczka's best game to date, though that's not saying all that much.  As usual a license game as FFG makes, it feels like a solid, individual design.  Neither WK or SC:tbg felt that way to me.  There's a lot to like, but in my first game the actions felt a tad meaningless.  Great, we've avoided the crisis for the turn, and we are closer to auto-jumping.  Now what?  I admit it's exhilerating to be battling the Cylons and to jump just as they produce more raiders, but very often they were back next turn, just as before.

Regarding the Cylons, our game-long traitor finally managed to search for enough long-distance planets to run us out of fuel.  Pardon me if that sounds like a less than thrilling denoument.  I'm also not a fan of the last half Cylons.  Those players work half the game to make things work right, and then they must start anew sabotaging things.  Feels very gamey to me.  Sadly, we didn't get to see the exposed Cylons in action, nor was anyone put in the brig.

As President, I felt I had far too many things to do (good!) with too few actions in which to do them (bad!).  Also, I made liberal use of leadership actions, which meant that I was forfeiting my own turn to allow another player to make a super-move.  And nothing says fun like not taking a turn!

Like AH, this will be more of an experience than a game, and I want more game.  But I certainly can respect Konieczka for the innovative design and the very particular tone the game evokes.

I own this and all the expansions. This is a great game of coop with a traitor. It has the feel of the TV series, and yet does not require you to know the TV series to play it. Excellent game that is best played with 4 or 5 people to get the full effect of the game. I highly recommend playing it over a month, with each week being the next expansion - it is like binge watching the show!

RATING: 10
All the games I've played of BSG have been a lot of fun. There's been plenty of tension, paranoia, panic and laughs at the same time. 

Game length is 3+ hours, which flies by for the most part, although the denouement can occasionally feel a bit drawn out and boring for the side that sometimes has no chance of winning. 

The game requires social skills like bluff and accusation. Creating uncertainty and distrust is the Cylon's main job in the early to middle game to ensure that the real humans fail to cooperate effectively. Then, during the 3rd quarter of the game, the Cylon's should start to expose themselves when the humans are running down their capacity to deal with events and BSG has a few holes in it, at which time the Cylons reveal while applying the crippling blow to BSG and/or team members. 

I've heard BSG can die if everyone isn't into using some social skills and playing up people's perceptions.   Fortunately I haven't faced that problem. I think BSG will frustrate most eurogamers or light gamers because of the need to manipulate perceptions, but its huge fun with a crowd of roleplayers, ameritrashers or BSG fans. Just wish I could play it more often!

As a fan of the re-boot TV series I was hoping that this game carried the theme though (having been disappointed by Firefly board game) but this time I was not disappointed! As not only do the characters interact as they did in the series but the suspicion over who is a Cylon adds superb level of tension and mistrust.
A TRULY FANTASTIC GAME!

I'm sure this rating is going to call into question my gaming credentials, but I think this game is just average. Maybe it's because I have never seen Battlestar Galactica and am generally not a fan of cooperative games. There is some tension to figuring out who is a cylon. It's fun to accuse people of being cylons, but the actual process of finding them out (or not) is bland. 

Maybe I'm playing it wrong.

I'll play if other people want to, but I won't suggest it.

Played: 6 times.

The biggest hit co-op after Pandemic, Battlestar benefits from its theme and potential for epic conclusions and tense moments. Battlestar does the traitor thing very well, something that Shadows Over Camelot didn't implemnent that well.

Having said all that, it tends to be a game that lives or dies by the group that is playing it. Some love it to death and others just don't get it. Regular play and understanding the system well are keys to enjoying the experience.

RATING: 6
Have played 4 times now.  2 wins for humans and 2 for cylons.  This game only works if people can get into their character roles and play the meta game more so than the game itself.  This is easier said than done.  Especially if you are not familiar with the TV series.

So although this game works fine with our game group, I can't see it working to well with casual gamers.  Also takes us a solid 3 hours to play.  Which is an hour longer than I care to play this game.  Once you are revealed as a cylon the game for the cylon gets a bit boring.

Although it may not be the popular consensus, I'd rather play Shadows over Camelot.  Easier rules, quicker play time, and more fun with a theme that has wider appeal to casual gamers IMHO.

Very interesting game, further play with a wide variety of players has convinced me that this game might be the best integration of theme and mechanics out there.
Expansions dilute the experience, don't seem to add much, the exception being huge fans of the show who play with the same people over and over and are getting bored of the game. I put my effort into painted ships and buying those little plastic "mini-mates" that look like all the characters. 
Playing with different people keeps this fresh for me. Does that guy really think attacking that base star in a viper is helping us? Not sure if serious, or Cylon...

I enjoyed both Avalon and Dead of Winter and want to see how this cooperation with hidden agenda game plays in comparison.

After first play: I'm confused. Why is this so highly rated? Repetitive gameplay where you only play cards of certain colors and numbers and then draw new cards. Dead of Winter's individual objectives offer much more tension and the zombie threat feels more imminent than the cylon ships. Avalon's streamlined voting mechanisms offer faster gameplay and more intense arguing. So why play Battlestar Galactica?

This is simply the best game I have EVER played in my life, and I don't mean just board games. I can understand Why some people don't like the game, for instance if you:
- Hate the Tv show
- Don't like long games (such as Brass or Power Grid)
- Don't like Co-op games
- Don't like Traitor games (such as Shadows over Cammelot)
You'll hate this game... Other than that you'll most likly LOVE this.
You'll like this game just as mutch as you liked the TV shows, it recreates the state you where in the entire series, don't knowing who's a cylon or who could be trusted to accusate other.
I do have to say that the game takes quite a while, last time I played it it took 4:00 hours, however I only realized that when the game ended, because during the game I was having so much fun (and getting so tense) that didn't mind the game ending 2:00 AM and having to work the next day... (And I would have played it again were it not for a friend who had to woke up 6 AM).

The game boils down to:

This game is really awesome. I'm planning on getting into the show now that I've played this game. I love the politics, the tactics, the stress... it doesn't get much better than this. It's really pretty too. But yeah, misses the perfect score, since I avoid playing this with 4 or 6 players because of the dumb sympathizer card.

UPDATE: Now that I have gotten into the show, I love it even more, because the atmosphere it creates is spot on. However, I refrain from bumping it up to a 10 because game length is something of an issue - as awesome as it is, we have started to begin games of this with dread, as we know what a huge commitment it's going to be. Definitely worth it, but might be even better with a half an hour chopped off.

RATING: 6.5
Good game design. Components and event cards are evocative of the series. Game can be tense, either because of scaring events or mutual suspicion of being a Cylon.

I have yet to understand and manage political actions, quorum cards, and to master the panel of Cylon action, both revealed and unrevealed.

RATING: 7
I have enjoyed my plays (which have included elements of the Pegasus expansion) but I find it too slow.  If you don't have one of the key roles your turn can go very quickly and then wait a good while for another quick turn particularly in larger groups.  The Cylons rule in our group, we must be a suspicious group for the humans to constantly fail.   Best with 5, good with 4.

RATING: 7.9
In most of the FFG games, language is the biggest problem for non-English speakers, and it become very serious in Galactica. The down time is quite long because of the fiddly progress and we spent a lot of time on identifying the text on the cards and locations.

Atfer the first play finish ,some of my group left immediatly,and don't even care if they have lost.

will try it again later after I do some localisation on  it.

Utterly, irredeemably boring. Whoever thought it was a good idea to make you wait 20 minutes for your turn, so that the entirety of your turn can be to tell your friend to take an extra turn because his character is better than yours at everything, needs to be slapped.

Another thing: if as the Cylon you can just sit back and do nothing (or even help) and still the humans lose, there's no fun in being a Cylon. Unless you like pounding on the defenseless, I guess.

I'd like to describe this game by just one word: "Wow-what-a-great-and-fantastic-game-this-is!!" It simply blew us away from the very first time we played it... It felt like we jumped right into the heart and spirit of the TV-series self! Legendary game full of delicious paranoia, recognizable events, issues and troubles for the fans of the series. I'm still figuring out how the humans could ever win their battle with the Cylons, but apparently it should be possible ;) If you're a fan of the series, don't think about it, go get it! And if you're not a fan... euhmm... well... go get it too! Currently one of the most requested titles within our gaming group, and for a good reason.

RATING: 6
Great fun when accusations are flying, though can drag with 6 depending on the group. Too much discussion, not enough action. Sometimes the post-revelation play can take too long, sometimes I can stop caring about who's a cylon because of the time and pace. Would like to do more 4-5 player games of it.

Rating assumes at least 5 players, and that Cylons don't simply declare. At groups less than 5, My rating drops to 6, or maybe even 5.

Fantastic implementation of the second television series. Possibly the best simulation of a fictional work that I have played... [Nope, see Star Wars: Rebellion]. Yes, better than Arkham Horror and War of the Ring, although the latter is ultimately more of a war game.

RATING: 6.5
A cooperative game based on the latest Battlestar Galactica TV series, where one is secretly either a human or a cylon. Each turn, a player must deal with a  crisis, simulated by playing cards face  down out of everyone's hands to beat a total. Negative values can also be played. The humans win by jumping Galactica 8 spaces, then one final jump, while the Cylons win by running down one of fuel, moral, population or food. The Cylons also win by having a boarding party advance four spaces on Galactica. 

It's got pretty good theme and a fun experience, but be prepared to spend three hours on it. There's also a good deal of luck involved, when you roll dice during combat.

RATING: 6.4
This game, Battlestar Galactica, and Descent would all get .5 to 1 score higher with me if you use clever streamlined mechanics so that a timer for each turn is actually part of the game and at least one person knows the rules so well that he doesn't have to check rulebook ever and other people know the rules at least fairly well on top of that.

Like BSG, Descent, etc. This game doesn't provide a natural incentive to move swiftly and yet, I've discovered that it's MUCH MUCH more fun when it's played quickly since it is an action--real time game simulation after all. I strongly recommend a system using timers where every player has a 1-3 minute timer which doesn't limit their entire turn but how long to take major decisions (they can still execute decisions after timer) this really speeds things up and makes things feel fun, exciting, and tense rather than just stressful, daunting, or overly drawn out. You can impose different reward/punishment incentives with health and ammo in subtle ways from the beginning so that there's incentive to move quickly but your not horribly punished if you occasionally go over.

This game, Battlestar Galactica, and Descent would all get .5 to 1 score higher with me if you use clever streamlined mechanics so that a timer for each turn is actually part of the game and at least one person knows the rules so well that he doesn't have to check rulebook ever and other people know the rules at least fairly well on top of that.

I really feel that if the pace and sense of speed was increased it would make the daunting overwhelming stress that this game has when it stretches to 4 hours turn into pure tense fun excitement played in 3 or less.

Overall good experience for the first time. May bump up or down in rating depending on more plays.

Played with five players first time.  Rules and text bothered me, but once the first round was played, the game unfolded quite nicely.

Cylon ships and physical threat did not seem troublesome at all.

Love the board and bits of the game.  Thematically appealing.

Played this once at a meetup. I think I'd like it more if I watched the show and got the references, but alas...

The gameplay was pretty decent. It was neat all the stuff that was happening and the crises were interesting. The traitor aspect was cool, trying to detect the evil guy/s, and I liked how I didn't feel like there was that much downtime with the constant talking and crises.

I guess I didn't like the ship combat as that was a bit confusing (would probably improve on later plays), and I dont know how much I like Co-ops in general as they generally seem to beat down on the players with trouble after trouble. I also think this game was a bit difficult for beginners, though I understood after a bit. This was also a bit longer than I liked. The theme was meh to me as well (not a sci-fi fan and not crazy about space), but overall solid traitor game.

Played again, and it was meh, taking way longer than it should have. Ive also just found traitor based co ops like this and DoW and even SoC to an extent to be flawed. The balance is off, downtime is high in these games, and the arguments and suspicions arent enjoyable for me.

I have yet to win this game once and the only time I have been cyclon, I helped the most to get the humans victory before I became cyclon. I was able to get us to a jump distance of 6 with just 2 jumps. (It was also my groups first win as humans.) 

Despite the fact that I always lost, it has been a really fun game. The problems are that games take a long time and it doesn't always seem worthwhile especially with big groups; however the game is also most interesting with big groups.

I'm starting to like this game even more than my beloved Shadows over Camelot. The main reason being there are many more interesting ways the Cylons can sabotage Galatica then the traitor can the knights of the round table. 

It combines some of my favorite elements of boardgames: co-operative play, secret roles (aka werewolf) and blowing things up with dice

The variety of characters and situations that occur are pretty sweet, I just played the new expansion for the first time and it adds some very cool twists. I'm looking forward to further plays.

Fairly easy when you get the main mechanics, with a lot of flavour to spice things up.
Battlestar Galactica combines many different elements to create a really unique, complete and fulfilling experience.
Try to fix the broken battlestar, with a bunch of Cylon pilots on your tail, while you use your diplomacy skills to persuade the others that you aren't one of them.

Can you trust your comrades when you know that a Cylon is among them?

Are you sure that you're not a Cylon yourself?

I like traitorous cooperative games.  They're not truly cooperative.  More like ferreting out the bad guy.  I love these element almost as much as I love being the traitor.  BSG offers this up.  The game is very long; however, this can be mitigated by players planning ahead so that they know what they will be doing when it is their turn.  If they don't, then the game may very well drag.  Plan some time for this game.  It's fun.

RATING: 8.3
One of my absolute favorite hidden-loyalty games. It's a coop game, honest! 40% of the group isn't trying to sabotage everyone, really! Has many ways to lose the game, which provides the saboteurs with multiple avenues of attack.

Expansions provide multiple new optional rules and play modes that completely change the game for increased replayability.

The game has some clear downsides though. It takes a long time to play, and it's fairly complex. It takes a while to explain and has the issue of having to explain both sides to new players well enough that they don't have questions that will reveal their loyalty. The game often feels unbalanced, though sometimes it's one way and sometimes it's the other.

And lastly, with extremely competitive, aggressive, and hostile gamers, the game is an abysmal and stressful mess. But, that's a social problem and not a problem with the game. It just suffers from players like that far moreso than other games, so I have to be careful whom I play with at conventions and game nights. Just, be aware that the game includes stressful and accusational situations as part of the gameplay already, so don't play it with people who create those situations in other social manipulation games like Settlers of Catan or Bonanza.

Even though I have never seen the show, I've enjoyed the many plays of this we've had. The game system is a little fiddly, but once you have someone in the group that knows it well, the speed of play increases greatly. The expansion is great to have, but not necessary.

theme is spot on with the tv show. can i objectively divorce myself from the show and comment on the game? yes. the paranoia is real, the game play simple and fun.

my only criticism of the game so far is that it has taken 4 hours to play. this will drop if the entire group is familiar with the game. will it drop to 2 to 3 hours - dunno.

Battlestar Galacuica the board game is so much fun I was compelled to watch the show after playing my very fist game. This started a long love affair with all things Battlestar for some time. As I played more and more game, like so many other people, I began to value shorter games, so I was less and less tempted to play Battlestar, pushing it out of my number one game of all time and almost pushing it out of my top 10 all together. For me, the strength of Battlestar is found in attempting to find out who the Cylones are. I love games where you are trying to "read" people and try to make correlation between their actions and motivations.

If you love the series you are definitely going to love this game.
 If you haven't seen the series yet,well you're gonna!!
 Usually games based on TV series or movies are either horribly tidius  and with pasted on theme to mechanics,or just mechanics with artwork from the medium that they're being influenced by.

   This one though,what a surprise.
The hidden traitor mechanic makes a resourse management/tactic/action point allowance game into an experience!

   This one bursts with theme and it all makes sense.
everything you do,everything that happens is supposed to be this way (I can only imagine).

 This is a must have for anyone,although it can last a bit longer than expected but that also depends on the players.

Far more interesting than Shadows over Camelot or Werewolf, IMO, but I wonder how much of that is dependent upon being a fan of the show.

It only scores a 6 mainly because it's frakking Battlestar Galactica, otherwise it would get a 5. This game oozes theme, so it's great to play it with other fans of the series. The problem? In a game that will last from 2 to 3 hours, you'll take around 5 or 6 turns only. It's tough: with less players, you won't have the same 'traitor' experience; with more, you'll spend most of your time watching other players taking actions. Pilots may suffer even more. In my last game, I saw our pilots leaving the ship, moving two or three times, maybe battling once, and then being kicked back because of the ship's FTL jump.

If people are fans of the show or lean towards sci-fi and are willing to accuse each other and get into the spirit of paranoia that the game so readily allows, then playing BSG is an absolute riot.  Despite the numerous chits and counters, and fiddliness of small decks of cards that need to be periodically shuffled, the experience one undergoes while playing the game is extraordinary.  I've played a 4p and a 6p, both have been enjoyable, especially the latter one.  However, there's many little rules you want to keep track of and please, don't make a mistake handling the loyalty cards, they ARE the core of the game.

I'm a very big fan of this game for a lot of reasons: excellent game mechanics, promotion of a lot of fun player interaction, tough but fair level of difficulty that keeps things well balanced. Not only that, but the game is brilliantly themed and makes use of the Battlestar Galactica licence fantastically well to enhance the experience, but knowledge is not required (the first 4 or so games I played was before I ever saw the series).

There's an element of needing the right people to play with I suppose, but this is a straight up top notch game.

RATING: 5
Battlestar Galactica is semi-cooperative, difficult to win, but functionally easy to play. The complexity of the game is in deciding which is the most pressing crisis that you need to address, oh, and discovering which of your fellow players is an enemy in disguise.

But... if you were not a fan of the TV show the characters and crises will have no emotional/nostalgic connection. The limited number of actions that each turn consists of (draw cards, move, do 1 thing) isn't very engaging. Yes, players do get a hand of cards, but there is very little variation in those cards, which leaves every player feeling like they are completely interchangeable and are all doing the same thing.

The cards in the Skills decks are too small. Granted, the decks are smallish stacks and table space is at a premium with this game, but the discard value of the cards is so important, it would have been nice if they had been easier to read.

Epic game where players are formed into two groups, cylons & humans, secretly dealt out at the beginning and mid-point of the game.  There is a chance that you become cylon mid-point through the game because of this mechanic.

While the humans are trying to pilot their ship back to earth the cylons are trying to stop them.  The trick here is they have to try and stop them without giving away the fact that they are a cylon or else you will be brigged and proven ineffective for awhile.  Secrets, intrigue, subterfuge, compiled with co-operation makes this game very fun and epic, every game you play.  

Out of all of the different games I have played, it's this one that you can always look back on and remember details of every game you played.  You can do this due to the secrets, manipulation, arguments, and sometimes cooperation, that all form to make this game the truly epic experience it is.

I would still recommend this to fans of the show or those gaming groups who think Werwolf is too short. (Also, I've never played "The Resistance" but heard it is similar to both these games, so you might want to check that out)

I liked this about how much I expected too. It does have nice tension with not knowing who Cyclons are, but it still has the feeling of the most vocal playing everyone's turn.

RATING: 4.5
I'm a fan of the show, so I dig the theme, and the theme's integrated well. I'm usually not a fan of space combat, but despite the title, there's not very much of it, and/or it's resolved so quickly that it seems like a trivial part of the game. But, it's not that much fun. There's not much you do in each turn. And, if you get a string of crisis cards that don't advance the FTL counter, humans aren't going to win. So much seems to hinge on which crisis cards are drawn that the game ends up becoming a game of chance with odds favoring Cylons. Also, to have half the group in a 6er be traitors seems way unbalanced. I've heard that humans seldom win this game, and in our game turns out they really didn't have a shot. The theme helps the game out a lot, but I don't find it particularly to be a game of skill; for me it gets some points for being a social game but loses more for not amounting to much: not much of significance you can do on your turn, just waiting to see which crisis card is chosen and if it features raider combat/FTL jump. I'd probably play again based on the theme, but this is severely overranked at #22 overall in board games.

Wow, the Ameritrash co-op game we've been waiting for.  And boy, does FFG mesh the theme with the mechanics here.  Most games I've played have been very even, nail-biting affairs.  Great for huge groups who aren't burnt out by co-op games.  This should be a side-by-side comparison with Android and a lesson in how theme can be integrated into a game without breaking it.

People who complain about the constant repetition of core game mechanics, in my opinion, are missing the real fun.  It's the same mechanics over and over, sure, but like poker the mechanics aren't the game -- the people are the game, because the game is won or lost by the human's ability to ferret out the toasters.  Humanity is a much more interesting game platform than efficiency engines.  This game keeps getting better with age, even with the same group of people; it forces the wily to play wilier, it forces humanity to get more clever, it forces everyone to step up their respective games.  And isn't that what you look for when you play?  Yes.  Yes, it is.  I am sad that I can only give this game a 10.

That being said, if your first move is throwing someone out the airlock, the problem isn't that the game is broken.  The problem is you.

2017 UPDATE: I don't play BSG as much as I used to.  But every game I play, I love.

Definitely one of the best combinations of theme and mechanics I've ever seen. The rules themselves are simple and can't really hold the game up by themselves, but when you get some halfway-decent players together, the paranoia and suspicion of the humans combined with the subtle influencing of both board and other players by the Cylons makes this an awesome game to play. Plus, it's easy to teach.

Awesome game hindered by complex rules and a long play time and rules overload.  This makes it hard to get table time and requires a rules brush up every time.  When the planets align it tells one hell of a story.

RATING: 9
rating after one game, which took way too long because reading just the rules is not enough to play the game fast with only newbies on the table. Looking forward to play again.

Rating up to 9 after 6 games. Great game!

Tried 2-player variant. It works and we will play it again. Each player must have  access to blue cards, either direct or via yellow cards. Otherwise a cylon will blow Galactica to pieces. Direct access is better, otherwise two turns are needed to repair a location (and two repair cards must have been drawn as well).

Fantastic semi-co-operative game which produces more war stories than any other three games put together. At its best when paranoia and mistrust is ramped up!

I think the secret alliance cards really work. Since you only know that there will be a certain number of Cylons out during the game, you are never sure when they appear. I also like the secret voting on all of the checks, that way people can sabotage without revealing themselves. The different strengths are also good, since different players can affect different win conditions. A better co-op game than any I have so far played.

The more I play, the more I feel that sometimes the win comes down to a die roll. I understand that alot leads up to that point, but it still feels anticlimactic. This is more prominent in a game with all revealed Cylons, once everyone is known, the game becomes much more manageable for both sides. Luck plays a much larger role at that point.

After further plays, I've come to the conclusion that the game is only enjoyable if I'm a cylon. Otherwise, what you have to do is pretty much scripted. That just makes for a long boring game. At least with LotR I can choose to be Sauron.

RATING: 7
First impression (4 players): A cooperation game with Battlestar Galactiga theme. The game mechanics borrow from Shadows of the Camelot and Lord of the Rings cooperation games but the combination feels fresh. There is Cylon(s) on board and the good guys must be able to make enough hyperjumps to get Kobol.

There were couple issues in the game. First of all it seems that after hyperjump sometimes there might long time without any Cylon space activity. This way it feels a bit too easy. On the other hand with four players there might be balancing issues with the Cylon sympathizer. If he is a Cylon then it's 2 vs. 2 and Cylons have almost guaranteed victory. If not then 3 vs 1 is quite sure loss for Cylons. Because of this it might be that game is really interesting only with 5 players. But it felt good and I'm eager to try it again before final judgment.

A very long cooperative game, with hidden traitors. Somewhat mechanical and repetitive. Also has some minor glitches in mechanics and gameplay, but those won't be an issue for BSG fanboys. 

The first playing was not that convincing, but at least it led to quite a lot of analysis after the game. That's always a good sign. The second session had an uninteresting beginning, was utterly hilarious around the two-hour mark, and then started to drag towards the end. I'd say you need one or two playings for all players before the game really starts getting interesting.

I do not like science fiction and I never cared for the television series. Battlestar Galactica is a bit dull in the begining but gets more exciting towards the end. I like guessing who the Cylon player is. There is not much of a game here but the system generates nice social interactions. The game is much too long for what it is - it can take 5 hours.

Non amo i cooperativi ma tra quelli che ho provato (Pandemic, Shadows over Camelot, Panic Station, Alcatraz...) Battlestar Galattica è a mio avviso il migliore. Anche se più articolato e avvincente ricorda The Resistance e Lupus in Tabula, anche qui infatti ci troviamo di fronte a due fazioni (umani e cylon) con ruoli non rivelati ad inizio partita. Il gioco rende con almeno 5 giocatori. Specifico che i frequenti lanci dei dadi (più che la pesca delle carte) rendono le partite molto influenzabili dal caso, ma il tutto non stona visto che il gioco più che sul lato strategico si basa su una costante valutazione del rischio, con frequenti possibilità di migliorare il lancio dei dadi con carte speciali. Penso che con giocatori inesperti i Cylon siano lievemente favoriti. Ricordo che la prima partita che ho disputato si è conclusa con un tiro di dado: da 1 a 4 avrebbe vinto uno schieramento e da 5 a 8 l'altro. Questo mi conferma la forte incidenza dalla fortuna (risolvere 3 ore di partita con un lancio di dadi potrebbe far inca**are) ma anche il fatto che tutto sommato il gioco è ben bilanciato. Trovo la durata delle partite (specie con qualche giocatore inesperto) un po' troppo lunga. L'edizione EG della versione italiana, secondo me fondamentale per chi non padroneggia l'inglese, ha diversi errori di traduzione sia sul tabellone che sulle carte. Dopo ogni partita mi viene voglia di vedere la Serie TV.

RATING: 5
I don't ever underestimate games with overchrome - and BSG has a HELLUVA lot of overchrome. Even to someone, like me, who has never seen a minute of the series, it is completely immersive and engaging. A proper Geekfest for the addict, I'm sure.

But the game underneath? Little more than a weakened version of Shadows Over Camelot. There's no real way of actively counterpointing a Cylon - the day that a game like this finds a mechanic that will let you do this without revealing your allegiance will be significant. And no real hand-management, as your card turnover is way too quick and driven by others.

Rated after 2 solo plays. Even without the intrigue I'm told about in the multiplayer, the solo game is a brilliant abstraction of the show's dynamic, pacing, and tension. The jump/regroup/jump structure gives you a little room to breathe before another massive Cylon assault threatens to cripple the Galactica.

Played multi now. It is better multi, but a bit longer than solo. I do recommend this for both modes of play. Playing a Cylon well is hard.

RATING: 10
Comment after over 50 plays.
The game has original mechanics and a very strong setting. It is half RPG and half party game (Junta-style) and it requires that players enter the setting's idea and know it a little bit.
It is pleasant and playing with experienced players makes the game long but very interesting. Every game is different!
Even though sometimes there are periods of time without any cylon ship on the board, the presence of cylons players still makes the game go on.

Its only problem are unexperienced players, which can be fooled too easily.

Didn't finish a whole session, only reached the fourth jump, but this game doesn't appeal to me. The mechanic left me frustrated and it felt like I couldn't DO anything besides the same action over and over again, or a similar action that did in no way impact the game in any meaningfull way. I felt stuck and frustrated most of the time, which might have been caused by one trip to the Brig and one to the Sick bay, but still.
I want to like this game but... the first impression wasn't very convincing, and I don't feel like playing again any time soon.

For "new gamers" there are a lot of mechanics to understand. And during the first few plays, you'll find yourself just trying to get to grips with them.

Can take 4 hours if you're learning which can be a little off putting.

I love this game! Though, it does have some weak spots: small variety of skill cards; the sympathizer doesn't work for our group, pilots are weaker than leaders.

UPDATE 01/2011
I finally realize that this game fulfills the role that 'Catan: Cities and Knights' occupied in the late 90's/early 2000's : A game everybody is always willing to play, a game full of excitement, interaction and a narrative theme. I have played this more often than any other "big" game within the last 2 years. 

So, I suppose is's a 10, right? 

RECOMMENDED TWEAKS: Sharon is put into sick bay, not the brig. Don't use the sympathiser, but an additional cylon card and add resources (alternatively; add a human card and reduce resources).

[i]Quick update - after watching the show I would love to play this again. I just remeber that it was dripping in a theme/show I didn't know at the time. Hopefully I'll get to play again!

While I found this game to be okay, but it is long. And while I (as a hidden cylon) managed to convince everyone else to throw a different player in the brig, I actually felt bad for that person because their options were so limited.[/i]

RATING: 10
I have a beat up copy that I'm willing to trade, and would like to trade for a new or almost new copy. 

I've played this over 30 times now (Jan 2010). Update: 145 plays (Sep 2013).

BSG can run long sometimes (3.5 hours), but is usually 2 - 2.5 hours (2hr 15 is typical). It's not too complicated or too simple for it's length. I don't normally like random dice and event cards in my games, but for some reason it doesn't bother me here.

This is a great game partly because it is so different to most other games*, but also because it is well designed. Innovative mechanics include the skill checks (inc. the destiny deck), the sleeper phase, the cylon ship activation symbols, the crisis cards that give one player a choice between A.) discarding personal cards (hidden info, these are a resource only to that player - but they could be cashed in to either help the humans OR sabotage the humans) or B.) losing a (collective) resource such as food.


* The only similar games I know of are Shadows of Camelot (not as good), Werewolf and Saboteur (good for what they are, but at 20-30 mins too short and simple for a full game session). 

It is quite hard for the humans to win, but that's not a bad thing. I think playing as a Cylon is more fun - but only slightly. 

I think there's a nice progression of tension on most jump cycles.

Usually by the time you jump some Cylon ships have shown up and are threatening civilian ships or to board Galactica. Sometimes you get a breather, when you can focus on other important actions like fixing vipers, quoruming, etc. Other times things spiral out of control, with the tension rising to a crescendo as someone hits the FTL button to jump ASAP.

By the time you have an idea of who the Cylons are (if any), another batch of loyalty cards comes out. Also as resources dwindle the tension mounts, as each skill check becomes more and more important, and resources are stretched thinner by the Cylons.

A great game. And I watched the TV show because of it, not the other way around. It's great TV too (or at least the first 2 seasons are - start with the Miniseries http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_%28TV_miniseries%29).

The best part of BSG is talking about playing BSG...then you're five hours into the game and all of that joy is gone, stolen by this game. People who love this game really, REALLY love it. Someone sold it to me as Resistance with action spaces and I was happy to go along with that comparison. But then I realize that a whole game of Avalon can only take up to thirty minutes and BSG is minimum of four hours. I wouldn't be complaining of the run time if it was worth it but I believe BSG is overcomplicated for what it wants to accomplish. Thankfully, there is a faster version of this that still feels like BSG. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I may not be the stingiest reviewer, but I try to be so with my 10 ratings. The original, unexpanded version of BSG is beautifully designed and evocative of the one-of-a-kind tv series (the reboot). I cannot think of a better match of theme and mechanics in my experience gaming with titles based on existing genre properties. This has seen countless plays at our table. Putting aside my love of the BSG-reboot universe, it's a game that works well even for non-fans who could care less about BSG. It perfectly captures the paranoia of a cooperative game with at least one traitor in the midst (who may not even know he or she is such early on). A classic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
A really great game. Always in demand in the group. The game system ensures a tight finish most of the time and strong replayability.

We tend to play games 6-8 handed (with extra loyalty cards). Lots of fun.

Despite the discussion from some on BGG regarding bias towards on side or the other we have pretty well maintained a 50/50 split of wins between humans and cylons right from our initial games and still sustained that with more than 20 games played.

update March 2010 - still hitting the tables regularly. Lots of interests from our regulars and part timers. Fun, popular and strong replayability.

Tremendously fun, and really immersive.  I always picture myself sitting around some war room table with my fellow characters hashing out who lives and who dies, who I can trust and who I can't.  I've been the Cylon for literally one round which ended in a Cylon win, I can't wait to do more as one of the bad guys.  I can only imagine the joy that you'd feel as your plans come to life and you take the game as the Cylons.

Core game is terrific. After 100+ plays I'm thinking it's probably also the very best iteration of the game. The color and extra characters are nice when you add the expansions, but my suspicion is that this game should not have been expanded.

RATING: 8
One plays this for the theme and to enjoy the meta-game (ie gaming the other players). There's enough mechanism to provide interest if you do, but not enough for 3 hours if you don't. I've got a lot of value out of this, enjoying each ride that it's taken me on. The story builds nicely, everyone starting as a human, but anyone could be cylon, and accusation builds on accusation, based on alleged incompetence in options chosen and who has secretly played dud cards into skill checks that should have reached the safe tally otherwise. Drama builds as players get chucked into the Brig, but was it erroneously, and should cards be spent to retrieve them so they can assist against the Cylons. Or are they Cylon? Eventually the Cylons feel they can do more damage revealed, and they then concentrate on pounding the Galactica with raiders, centurions, and so on, forcing the humans into a running fight to limit the damage before enough jump cycles have completed to win the game. Always fun and there's a story to tell afterwards.

The tension is great.  It is so fun playing political and casting doubt on other players or even trying to lift suspicion off of yourself if people think you are the Cylon.  It helps understand and appreciate the game if you know and like the TV series.

Great Game! Actually, the play length (3-4 hours) can be a little too long but I've really enjoyed this game every time I've played it. The 'hidden traitor' mechanic is where Battlestar Galactica shines. It really captures the essence of the source material in a way that no other board game has been able to do. Without the traitor, it's probably an average game but the suspicion and accusations and second-guessing really make this a tense ride.

RATING: 6
"I have only played the official pure co-op variant, with 2 players. It works fine, but it was obvious that we were leaving out a significant part of the game, and it runs long. As a pure co-op I rate it a 6. As a traitor game I would rate it a 2, since the length would amplify my dislike of traitor games."

What I like:
- Nice theme, and decent components
- Multi-use cards are always fun
- Some interesting decisions

What I don't like:
- I don't like traitors, but the game is bland as a pure co-op
- It felt about twice as long as necessary (at 2.5 to 4 hours)
- There are so many "least evil" choices

I would put the weight around 2.8 as a pure co-op. I can imagine it would be deeper with traitors, which might explain the higher BGG-voted weight.

Kinda clunky, a fair amount of rules-load which can make it hard for first-time cylons. Still a great game. Though I think Dead of Winter might be a little bit better.

This is an amazingly well done game. It's just complex enough to make the basic traitor mechanic interesting, while not being too hard to keep track of anything. Decisions are always interesting, and the game is full of variety.

RATING: 8
5-6 Players

Have the Exodus expansion



*****Shorter Game Variant*****

No distance, just have to complete 3 jumps to win.

Starting resources 6/5/6/7
Begin with 6 vipers and 3 raptors.

4 or 6 players, use the Personal Goal Cards. Play with 1 or 2 cylon cards, depending on whether there are 4 or 6 players. However, everyone will draw an additional card during the sleeper phase (Plan the deck size to accomodate this). This means that the humans will have a lot more Personal Goal cards, to balance the fact that they get an extra player on their team.

When you jump...
1 distance: ships are not removed from the board, advance pursuit track by 1 space
2 distance: play as normal
3 distance: admiral adds 1 to any resource, and jump track advances one extra space

Take out Legendary Discovery Card

After the first jump, deal out the sleeper cards and send Boomer to the brig.

After choosing a destination on the third jump, the humans win unless the destination reduced a resource to 0.

Whenever a cylon reveals before the second jump, he immediately passes his other loyalty cards to another player.

Five damage tokens are required to destroy Galactica.
The board party track is shortened by one space.



Cylon Fleet Board

-Cylon symbols add ships to the fleet board, even if the appropriate ship type is already on the main board. However, the pursuit track only advances if there is no appropriate ship on the main board.
-When a basestar symbol is drawn and both basestars are on the fleet board, remove all basestar damage tokens.
-When a 1 distance is resolved, keep all cylon ships on the main board and advance the pursuit track by one space.
-base stars cannot both be in the same space. Reroll.

Conflicted Loyalties:
-If there is a cylon card in the loyalty deck at the end of the game, reduce all resources by one.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.8
I think the rules on this one can be a bit fiddly at times - it takes a while to get clarification in the manual. The game also depends a lot on who gets the Cylon card. First of all, they need to have some idea as to what they are going to do, and they need quite a bit of game knowledge to be really effective. Then, they need to be a good bluffer. But it always gets an emotional response and leaves us with a story to tell :)

The big downer for me is that sometimes it it your turn but there is nothing that you really want to do. Compare that to Dead of Winter where there are too many cool things to do!

The mechanic of having possible dormant Cylon's present is very well done and adds confusion to the game (in a good way). At first, the Cylon players must keep secret, which makes it hard to effect the gameplay, but the game is long enough and the mechanics are so that subtle sabotages are possible while still being hidden and then in the second half, more obvious and even open attacks are possible. The destiny deck (where two random cards are added to the skill check) make this game work so well and all the mechanics fit well, while still giving the feel of the show. I must for any gamer who likes discussion, secrecy and fun!

I was surprised how much I liked this game (although I've only played one game).

I'm looking forward to playing again.

Like most co-op games in my arsenal this one is a bit of a dud with my group. The theme is nice and most of the players like it. However they really enjoy the "Who's the Cylon" aspect of the game. The survival of humanity is another question that they seem to have a tough time grappling with.
In time I'm sure that they'll get the hang of it. They enjoy it, it's just a matter of time until it clicks.

Il gioco ha l'eccellenza grafica della Fantasy Flight Games e il mio personale appoggio di fan della serie. Ed è per questo che la delusione è più alta. 
Il tabellone, gli indicatori con le risorse, i modellini di Viper, di Raptor e di caccia Cylon servono a riempire una scatola che fa da accompagnamento a un interminabile e pallosissimo gioco di carte.
Già, le carte. Dimenticabile fuffa con citazioni dalla serie, dove quel che conta è il colore e il numero scritto sopra. Alla faccia del detto "i giochi tedeschi sono astratti con uno spruzzo di tema sopra". Vale lo stesso discorso di quel capolavoro di Marvel Heroes: non bastano i cartoncini con le astronavi aerografate sopra per rendere un gioco "calato nell'ambientazione".
Aggiungi personaggi sbilanciati tra di loro, il traditore Cylon che non si capisce bene se fa più danni rivelato o infiltrato, una piattezza di gioco che si ripete, senza un sussulto, turno dopo turno per ore. Le meccaniche si risolvono in 1) "Estrarre la carta Crisi" e 2) "Giocare carte Skill". Da questo sforzo creativo mi aspettavo (e probabilmente avrei più apprezzato) un gioco di carte da mezz'ora.
Le restanti quaranta pagine di manuale - immancabile la sua presenza quando si gioca, impossibile farlo senza - sono un inutile esercizio di gratuita complessità, che serve a mascherare quella che forse era l'idea di base: una specie di briscola con le astronavi.
La montagna ha partorito un topolino: gioco pessimo che non merita lo spazio che occupa nello scaffale.

This is, perhaps, the most thematic game I've ever played. Every new play brings with it little nuances of how well plot points from the series have been woven into the game.

I enjoy the game, but having said that...I'm not part of the crowd that could play this all night, every game night. It's just too exhausting for that.

Also...7 players with the Pegasus expansion and Cylon Leaders... is tiring and I'm not sure I ever want to try that again.

Battlestar Galactica is a hidden team game--players get role cards telling them whether they're human or cylon.  The players then work "together" to overcome a number of challenges, which the cylon players can try to sabotage--but they risk revealing their identity if the humans can logic out who did it.  Additionally, a second round of role cards is passed out at mid-game, so players that thought they were on the human team might actually be on the cylon team.  The game, unfortunately, invokes one of my least favorite mechanics--arguing.  Additionally, the game isn't particularly well-balanced--the cylon team is far more likely to win, even if they don't do anything particularly nasty.

My favorite co-op game.  Every aspect of the game is tons of fun.  The only drawback is if there is no "cylon" in the first half of the adventure.  It can be too easy for the humans to win in that scenario.

Edit: Now that I have played a faster version of this game (One Night Ultimate Werewolf), I find this to be tedious and overly long.  Still playable, but you need the right crowd.

This game is a mixed bag of fun for me. There are times when it's absolutely brilliant and I feel like everything is moving along at a good pace, the cylons are giving it their all and the humans are pushing the jumps. Other times, you can get brigged and just want the game to be fucking over. You sit there and literally do nothing. I'm also not a fan of the pilot role. There never seems to be anything to do or if there is, but your attention is needed elsewhere, you get labeled a cylon for something that is just as critical. Ugh.

This game was overplayed for me, but if I get it to the table once every 3-6 months, I'm more than happy to play it again. At one point, it's literally all our group wanted to play and I grew very tired of it. It's also a lot more fun if you can actually read the cards flavor text.

I'm also undecided on how I feel about the expansions. I like bits and pieces from them, but when it comes down to it, I think I just like the base game best. Everything else just seems to add unnecessary complexity to a game that at it's core, is pretty simple and should probably stay that way. The pegasus board needs a house rule to fix it from being a damage sponge and the fleet board feels far too gamey. I like the extra action cards, but once you start to add in the brown treachery cards, it's just too much. Not to mention New Caprica and the other mini game they added in those expansions. Blech.

Although this kind of game is not usually my cup of tea, I can't say "no" to my favorite series... Compelling, engaging, but games can go on for many hours, so beware. I don't enjoy that much the sympathizer mechanic, as I find the Cylon Leaders from [thing=43539][/thing] much more interesting.

A great game, I wouldn't say I enjoy it as much as some people do. I feel the cylon side of things hasn't been done right. You always know exactly how many cylons there should be. So there is no mystery like Shadows over Camelot, the 'maybe there is a traitor' aspect is taken away. It becomes there is definately a traitor. And I think that is a negative.
I love the space fighting aspect too, it is often very tense and action packed!

RATING: 5
TRY Aug/08.  While interesting, it felt like a longer, more convoluted version of Lord of the Rings.

Based on our 1 play, I also got the feeling that fuel was going to be the one resource that controls the game.  There are very few ways to get more fuel, which means any options which lose fuel, except for travel, are not really options.

RATING: 7
The traitor aspect of the game is nice, which is why I rate this game 8 for now.

Did some downgrading: The game itself felt a bit repetitive. Maybe some more variation in cards would make the game better (it feels like every other crisis is water shortage or food crisis).

Battlestar Galactica is an interesting concept, but the game is too long and complex. The most engaging part is the "hidden traitor" mechanic, but the game has a huge number of fiddly components.

One of the best hidden traitor games.  I like how all characters have positive and negative traits.  There are a lot of decisions and even negotiating when other's turns, so "downtime" is minimal.  It captures the theme very well.

One issue is that sometimes the game ends based on a die roll as the humans vs cylons performance is close.

I don't know if The Resistance has ruined me for this sort of thing, but this game just seems to have way too much crap grafted onto it. Multiple special abilities and drawbacks for each character, space combat, boarders, random event draws, etc. It all just gets in the way a little too often. Plus, Cylons revealing themselves takes all of the tension out of the game, yet is a very tempting move because you become very powerful and untouchable. Needs more focus.

Game has been a blast everytime we have played it.  I am a fan of the show, and I am amazed at how well they mechanics of the game match the general feel of the show.  Only downside is that it can take a while (especially with slow players), and that there seems to be a good amount of luck involved in when certain crisis cards show up.  In my last game, the humans were nearly obliterated without ever jumping once due to a very bad string of crisis card draws.

An exceptional semi-cooperative thematic experience. It helps to have seen the series, but it isn't necessary. Half the people I've played with have never seen the show and still end up enjoying the game. 

The game isn't very complex, but it can be hard for new players to play Cylons effectively. So it's good to have some player reference printed out. 

The tension, stress, paranoia and agonizing decisions, combined with the meta-game of the Cylon traitors, makes for an awesome gaming experience like nothing else I've played.

The exodus expansion pushed this to a 10 for me. I don't think I'll be playing without it anytime soon. 

Also remember it's important to always call all the other players "Frakin Cylon toasters".

edit: I regret selling this. Also need to check out Dead of Winter to see how it compares.

edit: Sad that the license has been lost for this game. I was hoping to pick it up again now that I have a gaming group that I can count on to play it. This is still one of my top 10 games after all this time despite some of its weaknesses. Still need to see if Dead of Winter can replace this for me. (however I like this game more thematically. Dead of Winter zombie theme is less appealing.)

I bought this game immediately after reading the rules. The games with a decent politics aspect are few. I knew nothing about the series, which was shame since the knowledge just enhances the experience.
Anyway, the game is great even without knowing anything about the series. The problem is that if you are interested in the show, some potential spoilers are included (wish I'd knew this...).

The game is at its best with 5 people. With 3 it's just a stripped game with only mechanics left (good for studying the rules), with 4 and 6 there is a sympathiser-problem (unbalanced imho). With 5 players there are two cylons and three humans. Perfect.

The board itself is big enough and clear. There is plenty of room in the space but still it may all be in use at some point! Resource disks are a bit lame, but do their job fine. The plastic miniatures are just embarrassingly bad quality but this doesn't bother me since the game was cheap. I've used to those small skill cards so they don't bother me either. The problem with the skill cards is that they lack the variety. There are only two types of skills in every pile. Bleh. Well, waiting for an expansion.

It is clear that this game needs a proper group to be fun. Dare to go politic, unreliable, hysteric and finally, dare to betray everyone!

RATING: 6.5
Fun Factor: 4 (I have fun, but I also seem to get very emotionally bent out of shape... unfortunately this usually collides with my fun and creates a large explosion.)
Components: 6 (Cards too small, board a bit flimsy, small)
Theme: 10 (Almost perfectly represents BSG.)
Mechanics: 7 (Too much down time between turns.)
Theme + Mechanics: 10 (Mechanics really support the theme in a good way)
Replay Value: 9 (Every game IS different.)
Scaling/Players: 3 (Doesn't scale well. Definitely seems to have an optimum player #...)
Subjective: -0.50 (Revealed Cylon downtime horrible.  Playing against the humans from the start is the best option for any player, just in case you end up a traitor and have to take the humans down.  Metagame poor.)  Additionally, the paranoic and deceptive metagame is very hard on my psyche, so the game personally wears me down spiritually.

Played only once - this is (obviously) a glorified Mafia/Werewolf-type game. I'm don't care for either of those, but the setting and accompanying game elements that are added on to BSG are interesting. I'm just not interested for the full 5 hours this game takes.

This is the yardstick for all semi-co-operative 'traitor' games. It is best played with some but not all elements taken from the various expansions. With the base game and all three expansions, you have a choice of characters that seems greater than the total number of actual characters you can remember from the TV series. The cleverest device in the game is the fact that, as in the TV series, you could find you are a Cylon when you previously thought you were human. 

I succumbed to temptation and picked up the Broken Token organiser for this game. Implausible as it sounds, it really does enable you to fit everything from all the expansions into the main box, even with the cards all sleeved and with the stands added for all the ships.

RATING: 7
It is great to see such a great game developed as a tv show tie in! The mechanics are great and really give the feeling of desperation you are fleeing from attacking cylons while supplies are dwindling. (And my rating is all based on a solo run through, so there was no hidden traitor playing. I can imagine that my rating will go higher once I get a chance to play in a group setting.)

Update:  I am surprised to find that we actually have friends who will play this with us now.  The rules are a bit fiddly, although we're getting the hang of it, but the mechanics are so very good.  I do think that having a sympathizer with only 4 players is a bit too much though.

Old: A lot of potential for greatness.  We'll have to try the 2 player to see if it will get much use in our collection.  I'm concerned that we may not have a group to really play this with.  On the other hand, I was really mentally fatigued when I learned it, so maybe I am overestimating it's difficulty.

(1 play)  The single play was with 7 players using the Pegasus Expansion and the 7th player optional rule at the end of the rule book.  I was the Cylon Leader and the game was so dramatic.  The Cylon Leader has a completely secret wild card objective, and mine was that the humans needed to win, but one of three dials had to be 2 or below, so the humans had to be beaten down before the end.  The game was coming to a rapid close, and the dials were in good shape, so I was an obvious and overt player against the humans for most of the game.  Finally, Morale was down to 2, so I made an immediate about-face, trying to help the humans escape New Caprica any way I could.  In the end, I was able to make a final move to betray my two revealed Cylon brethren, giving two of the humans a clutch win, and leaving two stragglers to be executed on New Caprica.  I managed to orchestrate a position where the Admiral could win the game along with one human counterpart, or surely lose as the two revealed Cylons were next and the situation was DIRE.  One Cylon Leader and two Humans win, while two Cylons and two Humans lose - not an outcome anyone expected.  It took over 3 hours to play, but with that much drama and betrayal, time spent was not a problem for me.  I would love to play again.

I don't dislike this game, but I find it to be more of an experience than a game. There is just not enough game in it to justify the 3-4 hour play time. Not enough decisions to make and too many times where I feel that I have nothing substantial to do. I have played as both a Cylon and as a good guy, and preferred being a Cylon.

Hate is a strong word, but I hate this game.

Social deduction is so group dependent, and most don't make it exciting. Even so, this game is wayyyyyyy too long for a social deduction game. Also, way too much luck involved in fuel and cards that get added for a crisis. Just feel like if the wrong colors were neutral instead of negative, or if the values didn't go all the way up to 5 (like a separate deck that is only 1's and 2's, making failing with large numbers more noticeable).

Also, needs more variety in card powers. Only 2 per color?

RATING: 5.8
Fairly entertaining in the right group, but way too slow paced. Takes too long for what you actually get in return.

There are way better traitor games out there that does the same in a fraction of the time it takes to play a full game of BSG.

RATING: 8
Decent tension--definitely better than Shadows Over Camelot--but it ran on quite a while.  And, perversely, our first priority as humans was to drive one resource barely into the red while protecting others to prevent the sympathizer card from coming into play at the mid-point.  That worked perfectly, and we had plenty of population remaining to shed for quick jumps, so the cylons never had a chance.  Many elements more relevant to the theme seemed superfluous, but they were nice to look at.

played once (with a great moderator) with boucoups expansions.  i know how much it's loved, but it frankly feels like a lot of work for not a ton of game payoff.  lots of mechanics for enemy ships and stuff, and lots of possible actions (though none of them particularly fun or powerful).  would be happy to play again, but Knizia's games (particularly shadows over camelot) offer better play value for me.

Really felt like a one-trick pony each time we played it.  The tension of not knowing who the Cylon is really awesome and thematic, but once that is revealed, the game grinds to a crawl and the same repetitious actions are taken each turn with very little variation.  This makes it feel very tedious, and you wish that you didn't know who the cylon was again.  The actions the Cylons can take when revealed are not very exciting either, and it basically becomes a game of attrition which, while thematic, is very dull.

RATING: 4
Loved the show, but the game totally fell flat. In my first game, I was Starbuck (or Apollo?) and on every turn I would just flight a fighter out of the ship -- only to find that I was back on the ship by the time it got back around to me. So, I did the same action every round for a few rounds... and that took about 3 hours. Quite boring.

Has a good traitor aspect to it, that is made all the worse by the fact that every person needs to make several agonizing decisions each turn. Make a wrong or unpopular decision and you'll be pegged as the traitor. Nice tension by making the game hard to beat, even if the skill checks can be a fairly dry core mechanism. Surprisingly, it's the meta-game that is the best part of the experience.

The traitor mechanic on this game is at the core of everything. Getting the humans to win seems to be a fool's errand, but when accomplished, so satisfactory. It was a bit troublesome for me to trick my own kids into getting mom put on the brig, but that was what I was supposed to do. The only drawback for big fans of the series is going to be probably that you actually try and avoid space combat if you can, so pilots and attack oriented people may feel there is not enough action. This is a social game, in my opinion. The coop part of getting the humans to win is necessary, but the seed of distrust that exists in the early and middle game stages makes it hard for the humans to progress. Once the traitor or traitors have been revealed, it is an all out "let's get out of here" attitude. I can see this game go bad with the wrong set of people, so have that in mind.

Incredible game. Not only did they capture the feel of the licensed property but they did it well.

My one complaint (and it's minor at this point) concerns the number of Cylons in the game. Specifically, the number is fixed: 1 for a 3 player game, 1.5 for a 4 player game, 2 for a 5 player game, and 2.5 for a 6 player game. One of my favorite aspects of the game is the pervading notion that you never really know who is us and who is them. With a fixed number of Cylon players, the Cylon suspicion continues until all the Cylons are unmasked and then it immediately becomes "us vs them." I don't think there is a way to "fix" it and keep the came relatively fair.

People not familiar with the show might find it harder to grasp the game's mechanics and events, but it's not such a big difference to make an issue of it. Highly recommended, especially if you like the series.

Be warned: this game, probably more so than all others, really REALLY depends on the group of people you're playing with. Are they good at bluffing and deductive thinking (depending which side you are on)?

Secondly, it really needs the expansions, because if not it becomes boring quickly (only 2 types of cards, not enough things to do).


Thus being said, this is the most (over)played game in my gaming group, from 20.00 till morning hours. Frakking Cylons.

Update: Rating down from 9.5 (2012) --> 7.5 (2016). Might have played too many games, but I feel it's too long for what the game has to offer. Besides, optimal tactic would be for all except 1 player to sit in jail.

One of the best games ever!!  Always a suspenseful and tense game.  I am terrible at figuring out who the Cylons are.  Definitely a much better game once players have a game or two under their belts.  We have see the Humans win by a lot, a little, and the skin of their teeth in a last minute gamble.  We have seen the Cylons win with every possible mechanic from food, fuel, moral, or population exhaustion; From the centurions boarding the ship to the galactic getting blown out of space; we even had all the important people get execute in one game, 6 people died I think. (Not technically a lose condition but we lost a moral for each and lost from that.)

Unlike any game I have ever played in regards to the deception tactics that must be used to play this game succesfully as a Cylon. The actual gameplay is mediocre and somewhat convoluted.

Whenever I have played a cooperative game with multiple different groups of people one person ends up taking over the strategy decisions for the entire group.  In this game it is particularly frustrating because in my experience if you did anything other than what you were told (which was generally a really good move) you looked like a cylon (and probably were).  Also the correct moves for the humans always seemed really obvious even if no one was telling them to me making it pretty boring.

I have to assume it's the theme that's getting everybody all worked up, 'cause I couldn't wait for the one game I played to be over. Shadows Over Camelot does the whole 'who's the traitor' thing much better, and FASTER than BG.

Wonderful game, full of excitement, suspicion and twists and turns. A long game, but each turn goes by fast. Great theme, it really feels like you're in the TV show, and the components are very good for a $40 game.

Edit: On the other hand, when they're no cylon ship nearby the game can get a bit dull. Likewise the crises eventually start to look the same. Basically if you don't have the psychological tension of struggling with a traitor, things can get dull, especially because the game takes a while to play.

Oddly boring in the single game I played.  I dislike the idea that the game starts out co-op, but becomes ruthlessly competitive by the end...although I realize that's the point.  Quite a bit of downtime in a six player game, but you can't walk away, as there's a chance you'll need to lay down a single skill card.  Disappointing, as the show is one of my favorites, but as a game, probably one I'd pass on if offered again.

Not a good first impression. Game play strongly influenced by how many aliens come out (first round had all humans which made for boring play with no traitors). Second round had two come out of course but time was running out. Long downtime between turns is a big turnoff. Twice I went to fight outside the ship as a pilot, once we jumped the other time I got shot, effectively losing not only that turn but also the next one drawing only one card in sick bay. A third time I was in a part of the ship that got blown up so I went to sick bay. when the time between plays is so long and you can get taken out by events out of your control that cannot be mitigated, not a big fan.

Not a *huge* fan, mostly because the people in my game club that play it over-analyze the crap out of every little thing when trying to determine who is a Cylon. Not much fun when the game-play takes an extra 1.5 hours due to player speculation and accusations.

Warning! Do not be fooled by fans of the show telling you that you do not need to watch the show to enjoy this game! Die hard fans want to play this game so bad that they will suck anyone in with this line.

Played a 6 player (3 newbs and 3 vets) 3 1/2 hour game. I was the Admiral, so there was nothing for me to do for the first turn (30 minutes, who designed this thing!), except crack jokes about the Admiral being in the bathroom and such. Once I was in the game (turn two) things went faster, barely! Now I was getting a turn every 10-15 minutes.Whoopie! By a turn I mean drawing cards and then passing my one action that I waited 10-15 minutes for, onto another player. Even though I wasn't a Cylon, I wanted the humans to die at about the one hour mark.

I have to say that I am being selfish here. As boring as things were for me, I had it good compared to the first Cylon revealed. His character had very little to do once he was revealed, poor guy!   

Don't get me wrong, there are some neat mechanics in this game, but the mechanics become repetitious and boring very quickly.

By the way, the Cylons won and I cheered for them because they finally put me out of my misery. My only wish is that they could have done it sooner!

Didn't get to experience that cylon tension that the game is famous for as our first game revealed a cylon very early and the second cylon was prevented on purpose. Left a smooth sailing game that had little to do.

A very intense semi-cooperative game. Where the human players are trying to reach the planet Kobol, and the Cylons are trying to prevent them. The catch is, no one knows which players are cylons, so no one knows who to throw in the brig or who to trust. It's like risk combined with mafia.

The game itself dictates much of what happens and the players are just there for the ride without affecting much of what is happening.

Not my cup of tea.

Frankly, there exist at this point a half-dozen games of varying lengths that do this experience as well or better.

I don't consider this one a cooperative game, it's a team game - and for me it's better. However it's a very good game, highly thematic. I'm not a great fan of the fiction (I liked the first two seasons), but the BSGalactica's feeling is perfectly recreated at the table and the traitor/s mechanism is really the best I've seen around: Cylons may REALLY hurt and in many ways. A lot of variety, with many situations and different gameplay - primarily due to the Crisis deck draws in my opinion - also if sometimes may cause a little stall, but it's only a minor flaw for me.
A must for the series' fans.

Shadows over Caprica. 
If you liked the ideas behind Shadows over Camelot, you will very much enjoy this game.

The game is thematic to the show. Its game play better supports the theme than Shadows over Camelot did. However, like its predecessor being the traitor is much more fun than the regular folks. The Pilot role looks to be distinctly less interesting.

The common skill check provides a much better mechanism for cooperation, along with a better opportunity for the traitor to sabotage the communal effort (remember be subtle).
The two tier traitor deals (one at the beginning and one at mid game) nicely catches the "sleeper agent" aspect of the show.
The Cylons are constantly battering at the gates - so much time is spent just trying to fend them off.

The downside is there is a lot of card fiddling during the game - you go though a LOT of skill cards - but again I think it is necessary to mask the traitor.

During the show (as in the game) I would laugh that the Colonials were in search of Cobol (excuse me Kobol). Where is Capt Grace Hopper when you need her?

This game hits on everything - Theme: it feels like you're playing in the series.  Engagement: every player is involved on every turn, and every turn matters. Replayability: Even without the expansions, no two games are the same.  With the expansions, the game becomes even more amazing.

RATING: 8
Wow, that game is great! It has it all for me. The tension not knowing who the cylon is, the blind accusation, the power struggles, and in all of that, a fleet to guide to Kobol. If you have a good cylon player, it makes the game very tensed. The key, and what is realy tough being a cylon, is knowing when to revele yourself. So it can be realy fun to be the cylon player. The main advantage about the game is that there is no down time. You participate to the discussions about the decisions and help (or not) when there is a crisis for the other players turn. So you are always in the game. The material is superb. The rulebook is superb but the rules are arsh to read the first time and you will need a couple of games before mastering them all. The only down points would be the relative low choice of action at your turn sometime and the play time of the first few games. The theme is realy well exploited in the game. I will never turn down a game BSG except for time considerations.
Update: Lower the score from 9.5 to 8 because I feel that the game is more a rôle game. If people are not playing the roles or only one player is taking the whole field not leaving any place for the other player to get in the game, it can be quite boring then.

Wow, ce jeu a tous! Le fait de ne pas savoir qui est le cylon, les accusations sans fondement, les luttes de pouvoir, et dans tout ça, une flotte a mener jusqu'à Kobol. Si vous avez un bon joueur cylon, le jeu peut être très tendu. La clé pour le joueur cylon, et ce qui es vraiment difficile, est de savoir quand se révéler. Jouer le cylon peut être très intéressant. L'avantage de ce jeu est qu'il n'y a pas de temps mort. Vous participez toujours aux discussions et aidez lors des résolutions de crises. Vous êtes donc toujours dans la partie. Le matériel est superbe. Le livre de règles est superbe mais les règles sont un peu difficile à lire et vous aurez besoin de quelques parties afin de bien maîtriser celles-ci. Les seuls points négatif seraient le choix restraint des actions certains tours et le temps de jeu des première parties. Le thème de BSG est rendu à merveille par le jeu. Je ne dirai jamais non à une partie de BSG, sauf pour une question de temps.

Mise à jour. J'ai descendu la note de 9.5 èa 8 de ce jeu car je me rend compte qu'il s'agit d'un jeu de rôle et que lorsque les joueurs n'embarquent pas ou lorsqu'un joueur prend le contrôle de la partie et que les autres joueurs ne peuvent jouer leur rôle et embarquer dans la partie, le jeu peut être assez plate.

RATING: 8
Like Mafia/werewolf, but with team objectives. Looking forward to this one.

EDIT: One play, was very tense and a good overall experience. The rules were tough to get a handle on for the two players who don't play games but love the show. It took forever to get the basic flow of gameplay down, but when we did, things got going fairly well. This game would likely benefit from a few more plays.

Tentative rating: 8/10.

Edit: After the second play, the game flowed more naturally and took less time, but the Cylons made some key errors halfway through the game that made it somewhat inevitable that the humans would win (and everyone pretty much knew it for the entire final hour of the game). I kind of don't want to hold that against the game because if all players are playing at a high level, that problem goes away, but for a game aimed at fans of the show who don't usually play complex games like this, it was a bit disappointing to see their lack of rules understanding ruin their chances completely. It's still good, but realistically only great with a higher-level group.

RATING: 7.5
Semi-cooperative game that works well even if you don't know the series. Inspired me to get the series and watch it. In 4 and 6 player games, the sympathizer card seems to encourage gaming the system. We were doing very well in our first 6p game, to be punished for that by losing an additional human. If we'd knew, we'd have pushed one of the dials into the red to prevent this from happening. This shouldn't happen in a game so thematic.

Another one of my favourite games, sadly it does not make it to the table nearly as much as I'd like.   I like cooperative games but I find that one person tends to make all the decisions and just directs people on what to do.  Whereas any cooperative game with a traitor makes every action a decision for the individual to collaborate with the team.  I love cooperative/traitor type games for that exact reason.

I don't understand what's wrong with this game. All the elements to make this a cool experience are present; incredible theme, hidden traitors, survival, BSG BSG BSG. Somehow though, this game falls flat. The pacing is terrible, hunting for the traitor is abstract, external threats are negligible, conflict resolution is dull. The big reveal was not much of a reveal at all. I feel like I might want to play it again but it's probably BSG bias more than anything else.

Not for me, thank you very much. I guess series fans can lower the bar somehow, but I didn't watch it. I suppose you can play it without knowing all the story bits, though.

So many things, so many rules, and it's all just to figure out who's the "bad guy". Too many things and mechanics mashed together and not working very well. The main gist of the game is to draw and play cards and then desperately ask others to believe you. If you fail, prepare to spend most of your game doing absolutely nothing. 

If you just want to play hidden role game, maybe just play Resistance. It will take 15 mins and that's about the same emotion and excitement time you'll get from 4h torture of Battlestar Galatica.

The system itself and the cards seem far more powerful than any smart strategy the players can create; I have some doubts also about the role of Cylon player(s), as it seems there's no real advantage to guess his real identity, and in every case he has only advantages to reveal himself and start making chaos with his own apocalyptic cards.

RATING: 10
This is the first semi-cooperative game I played and I enjoyed it very much. Great mechanics and lots of variety in possible strategies, both for the good and evil players. There are a few reasons why this is not a 10 to me. 1: The Theme, I am not a Sci-Fi fan and never saw a single BG episode, so it does not add or take anything for me. If anything, it makes the game harder to relate to. 2: The game encourages social gaming, a lot ! So if you are playing with people who are not into that, the game loses lots of its appeal. Also, the is a lot of accusing, nastyness and betrayal going on, which can be fun, but some people may not like that sort of interaction. 3.) Experienced players have an advantage over newbies. Other than that, Amazing game.#

EDIT: I would rathe this a 10 for the game that takes place before the Cylon(s) is revealed, it becomes less exciting and rather anticlimactic afterwards.

EDIT: Played Shadows over Camelot for the first 2 times today and must say that it is the superior 'traitor' game, not by much but still. I prefer the theme, playing time and nature of the climax.

Definitely fun, but this did not live up to all of the hype I've heard over the years. I was hoping to get a top ten game out of the experience. Nope.

I really enjoy playing this -- I am a fan of the series on TV and the theme made sense. There is good tension during play and I really like the mechanics to give information about who is a cylon.

RATING: N/A
Picked it up for the theme and really good reviews on r/boardgames, as well as the traitor mechanic. This game feels super cutthroat, has great theme, and has nice character selection. I feel like it overstays its welcome, but makes for some epic stories/games. Playing this is just so exhausting though, and you definitely have to play with the right group. Practicing with Resistance beforehand definitely helps. Also, its an utter pain in the butt to teach. So far, Cylons have won all of the games, but some were super close. 

As with the Resistance, this game thrives on player interaction, and really falls flat with some peeps.

RATING: 3
Very repetitive.

Straightforward combat mechanism. Specified colours, or suits, of cards count towards fighting a particular crisis, other suits count against. Cards also double as special-action cards; each suit has a different selection of actions, which contributes greatly to the theme. All players contribute cards to resolve a crisis, but no one knows for sure who played what card.

This is the main mechanism of the game. However, this mechanism never changes, or develops, at all -- it changes a bit when Cylons use their "special" crisis cards, but other than that, every fight against a crisis feels the same -- each player has a maximum of 10 skill cards to fight against any given crisis, and the nature of those skill cards never change throughout the game -- you can't invest in any accumulative powers that would enable you to defeat crises in a more efficient way -- nor do crises steadily become more difficult.

One more issue: With any direct conflict game in which players must defeat each other, it should ideally end as soon as players recognize who's the strongest and who's the weakest. However, if you have a case where the players discover who the Cylons are and manage to send them to the brig, then those poor Cylons must wait quite a long time for the rest of the humans to finish the game -- there is simply no way to quicken the end conditions of the game.

As for my tastes, multi-player direct conflict games must have a theme I find interesting. Unfortunately, I have no interest in science fiction; I had to rely on my other opponents to give me a basic rundown of the TV show on which this game is based.

The downside:
-Taken into account that there's not much of a game to see here, the experience, which is suposed to be the heart of this neverending nightmare, was the worst of my gaming life so far. This game doesn't work, because it never gives you time to care about you character or other people characters, or even the destiny of everything, since right from the start, you begin to decide the fate of things as if you have a backstory of 20 years together! How the f#&% am I suposed to give sH!? to the cards I choose to play, to who goes to the brig, to who forgot to pay is alimony, or to who might be the f#ckin CYLON?! I cared for how long it would take to finish, if you're interested...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Tough game to rate (especially on 1 play).
On the one hand, it has quality bits & a unique combination of mechanics, which I appreciate.
On the other hand, it is so complicated that it requires a pretty thorough understanding of the entire game before you can even make any meaningful decisions/strategy. It is therefore highly susceptible to the "dominant players decide group actions" (moreso than Arkham Horror, SoC, Pandemic, & LotR put together) on 1st plays.
In all those games, you can cover the basics and start playing, and people can learn as they go. Not so with BG - almost everything is public information (and heroes can MAKE the skill checks public if they want) so you've got to know the game inside and out to even play a Cyclon or your actions are transparently reverse-deducible.
Once everyone memorized the rules/goals (I'm not kidding - there is almost zero on-board indicators about how things work), the strategic element of this game would improve dramatically.
However, by that point I'd venture to guess that the absurd amount of randomness might start grating on people - similar to Arkham Horror, this game is utterly dependent on card draws and dice rolls - you can work for 5 turns and not accomplish anything, and then 1 turn when the right card comes up you get more done thatn all 5 previous turns. 
Did the designers REALLY need the basestars to have to roll a 4-8 on a D8 to do damage to the Galactica? That leads to the situation where they can completely whiff, even if a perfect storm of events is pointing towards basestars attacking. It's almost like the designers took out auto-effect mechanics and figured "Hey, let's make it a roll! Everyone likes those!" and forgot to factor in the aggregate unbalancing impact if all that randomness - as people have pointed out, many games are either landslide Cylon or human victories.
I don't think SoC has THIS amount of overwhelming randomness (but I'm still testing that opinion).
I'd put BG in the same group as Tomb and Arkham Horror in this regard - too long of games (3 hours), that require strategy but make mockeries of it.

Like LotR, BG almost requires players to be knowledgeable of and enjoy the theme.
Do NOT play this with non-gamers expecting for them to come around to the concept of boardgaming.  WAY too fiddly, complex, and long for that.

This is the most social co-op game I've seen along with very interesting traitor mechanics. I like the different levels of challenges players face, from resource management to dealing with random crisis and always trying to keep up to the big picture. The game mechanics aren't anything superior, but they complement the whole social aspect in a fantastic fashion.

Best of all, it's completely playable if you haven't even seen the series.

Only played once so far (4 player). Got off to a very slow start while playing a learning game. It soon became clear who the cylon was, but it was too late for the humans.

Want to try again, but for now it seems like the game is too long for what it is. I imagine things would flow smoother once everyone knows the rules, but the first game soured everyone a bit.

I'm a toaster, youre a toaster, EVERYONES A TOASTER!!! By far one of my most favorite games. As a fan of the tv show its hilarious to see some fo the outcomes of who is cylon and not.

I love the idea of this game, especially the cylon, but it plays clunky.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I like this game for many reasons. You have a very detailed character system. Each person has an ability, a once-per-game power move and a weakness. They also draw different sets of cards. And there are 10 of them. The game system is also relatively easy to follow, I personally use the DMAC system: D-raw, M-ove, A-ction and C-risis. The crisis cards are pretty interesting and as a fan of the series, I appreciate that they used images from the show. I often remember where certain events happened. It even has 2 status titles, the Presidency and the Admiral.

But then wait...

There's this whole traitor system as well. This is really, really brilliant. Traitors not only have an effect when they reveal themselves, but they also have interesting choices they can make on their turns, rather than do some boring crap like in Shadows over Camelot. If they pretend to be human, they can also do sniveling things as well such as screwing up with skill checks.

BUT...

The game is pretty long. 3-4 hours is just too much sometimes. The game also has too many side rules that make it feel messy and poorly designed. People's natural tendency is to reveal themselves as the traitor whenever they want to, but you actually have to have an action to do so. When doing skill checks, you can't say what will put in, you can only say "a lot" or "a little". They could have cut some more things out of the game to make it smoother for new players such as making the skill cards a bit simpler, making crisis cards happen less often (but have a bigger impact), etc.

This game is a good one and has a good overall concept. I just feel that the premise isn't too hard, but that there is too much detail for the average player. I mean you have 10 characters, but then the new player has to then go over each of their abilities and weaknesses. You have skill cards, but then you have a range of 5 numbers and colors, plus you have 2 abilities on each. You have destinations, but then you have a range of 3 numbers, plus a ton of different outcomes. It's a good game, but it's a nightmare for people who want to memorize everything. The value of the game isn't that any one thing is particularly deep, but that there is just so much content that gets flung at you that you just can't recognize much at all. To make a comparison, Go is the complete opposite: the content is easily absorbed and understood, yet the depth comes from the analysis of the board state and player interaction.

With that said though, a person who has a general sense of the game and knows all of most of the content will appreciate the game more than someone who is completely lost. It takes a while to get over this hump and being 3-4 hours long does not make it easy to do so. However, the game is probably one of the best games that mix traitor elements with an actual game. It is miles better than Shadows over Camelot.

RATING: 8
It's a pretty good game.  The people I play with are getting a little tired of me accusing them of being cylons before the loyalty deck is dealt, but it's a good game that will probably continue to hit the table for some time.

It's a little bit longer than the time I'd prefer to spend on one game, but it doesn't feel too long.  The rule book is terribly written.  The first game I played took six hours and we didn't even finish it because it took  too long to fight our way through the rules.  The rules desperately need an index.

This game was a lot of fun, even for players not familiar with the series.  Good tension between players and a healthy sense of paranoia.  However, the rules left some gaping holes that led to some minor squabbles and the space combat seemed underdeveloped and a very unbalanced factor.  Game length is a little long, but that should improve with familiarity.  This game requires the right group of players to truly shine.

Great bits, thematically strong, and some original mechanics.  Not completely sold on the overall flow of the game or how the cylon traitor system works, but still highly enjoyed every game played so far.

Component Quality:
Excellent. My only complaints would be that there's sometimes too many cards to keep track of and the board is hard to store with the spinners attached. Otherwise it captures the spirit of the show perfectly. My copy has seen dozens of plays and the components are holding strong.

Gameplay:
Perfect blend of a variety of mechanics. The game forces players to make a lot of tough choices which makes figuring out the cylon player a blast every time. Best traitor mechanics i've seen in a game. This is probably the only game I could play over and over again without growing tired of.

Very cleverly designed, and highly thematic. Fans of Battlestar Galactica and of cooperative games will probably enjoy this game. In general I don't care for cooperative games, but this is one of the best -- perhaps because it's only partly cooperative. Are YOU a frakkin' toaster?!?

BSG is my second favorite game.  We usually play with 4, which is fun, but it gets better and better the more people that play.  It pretends to be a cooperative except some of the players (up to 3 in a 6 player game) are secretly trying to sabotage the efforts of the others.  The accusations fly!  It's a blast!

I find it hard to believe all three of the following:
-- Cylons can be disguised as humans.
-- There is no test that can distinguish them from us.
-- They have super strength and other powers.

Enjoyable cooperative game with a treachery element (Cylon Traitor) that really spices things up with accusations flying everywhere.  The theme is well executed here and the suspense of the traitor laying within waiting to pounce creates great stories after the game is done. Although its a good game, the tense periods are often the early and end game. The mid point of the game can occasionally get abit draggy especially with "AP" prone players.

Fits the theme very well, and in the games I've played has always had a down-to-the-wire finish. I'm slightly concerned that a revealed cylon is actually more effective, meaning there's little reason to bluff - and playing a revealed cylon is less interesting. Hopefully Pegasus will help.

This game has SUCH potential.  But I think it comes up short.  Each game I've played, once the initial cylon attack has been jumped past, there is not another one for at least an hour of play.  To be fair, this is purely unlucky, but I think being on the ropes from a cylon attack is half the fun of the game.  When there are no cylons to fight, the game drags incredibly.  Sorry, but this just missed the mark for me.

The updated edgier version of the series in a box. 

My only complaint is that sometimes the game can go on for much longer than is necessary. My longest game that I played in went on for 5 and a 1/2 hours. At around the 4 hour mark, the Humans (of which I was one) were looking like we were going to win; around 5 hours in, one of the Cylon players screamed, "Ohmygod! I am SO bored!", before she burst out in hysterical laughter, causing me to also laugh with her.

Like any other game of the similar ilk, players need to moderate the game with regards to time taken to reach a decision [Crisis cards] to keep a good flow and tension.

I really, really do enjoy BSG with a good group.

Achieves what it sets out to do - a very thematic cooperative/traitor experience. 

However, it looks very tough on the human player unless an experienced player takes the reins and coordinates the efforts of the (presumably) human players. The problem here is nobody will trust anyone who wants to take charge of the human efforts, and even if they do that sort of guided coordination is why I've always disliked cooperative games.

RATING: 9.2
Absolutely the best game I have played. The game mechanics are good, the blending of the tv-series with a boardgame is done very nicely and the interaction with your fellow humans(?) is sublime.

The only drawback is your fellow gamers. When you play the game with people who doe not have a pokerface or know a subtle way to mislead his fellow gamers it's a frustrating game (for the have-no-way-to-conceal-my-darkest-secrets-people).

Why didn't I rated this game with a ten. Well, there are some game mechanics that are in some situations very frustrating. Like when humans(?) are suspecting an other player to be a cylon they have the option to throw that player in the brig. Except when this player is very lucky, or convince the other players that he is a human, he will sit in the brig for the remainder of the game (sometimes up to 3 hours).

Next to the game mechanics there is a very small problem with the gamepieces. Overall it is fantastic. I have never seen a game that is so greatly styled and crafted. The little miniatures are beautiful, the gameboard is of great quality and alle the cards have exiting flavor text that give a wonderfull flavor to the game. And of-course we have the basestars, who are not..... that great. Except of being nicely crafted miniatures they are tiles. In a normal game it would not be a problem, but with this game where there has gone so much time and effort in the "look and feel" of the game it is just a bloody shame. 

Fortunately the Pegasus expansion resolves all problems. The game mechanics are corrected and the expansion have two nicely crafted miniatures of the basestars, but to be fair the problems shouldn't be in the game first place.

I seem to be harsh in this review. The reason for this is a bit of frustration. The game is really wonderfull and it could have been a rating of 10. But these silly errors has dropped the rating, and I feel bad for Fantasy Flight..... because this could have been a perfect game.

One play only (5 players).  Everyone loved it, even if it did take us 5 hours to finish.  The humans just pulled off the win in the nick of time.  Am keen to play again ASAP but the time factor may count against it getting a regular airing.     
2nd play - less tense than 1st play as Cylons won with ease.  Some bad luck with fuel loss crisis cards and a cylonic admiral who drained 3 more fuel with a craftily chosen destination card made for a rout.

RATING: 8
This is a rating on one play, so I'll likely have to revise it again later. If you like the theme great, but ignoring that (I've never seen the new series) this is basically Shadows over Camelot 2nd Edition. Some-one sat down looked at where that game was limited and how they could fix it. And on the traitor mechanism they scored big time. Replacing the accuse action with the Brig was a stroke of brilliance and the more obvious second deal of loyalty cards was clever. Over-all a very good game, and a nice addition to the co-operative (with traitor) games.

Played twice over the weekend, still working out some of the rules.  Each time had a real blast, hit the sweet spot with everyone.  Co-op game with traitor element.  Very thematic and you don't have to be a fan of the series to enjoy it.

31.08.2014. Play this for the experience. 

:star::star::star::star::nostar: Easy to learn
:star::star::star::star::nostar: Fun factor
:star::star::halfstar::nostar::nostar:   Replay-ability

why this game stays in my collection?
The mechanics with the voting on decisions can feel repetitive and some turns you can find yourself with very little to do.
But the whole traitor role mechanic, with other players possibly being a cylon or sympathiser can make this one of the most socially orientated and entertaining games.

I've only been able to get to the table ONCE and that was only a 3 player game. I can tell though that it is an awesome game...only trouble is the length of the game. The accusations where being thrown all over the place and it captured the paranoia and feeling of the series for me. Rarely have I seen a game's mechanics so perfectly fitting to the theme nor have I seen many games based on movies or TV shows that a) don't complete suck and b) make thematic sense.

RATING: 7
Very good, very tense game. It really captures the essence of the first season: Frantic attempts to escape the superior Cylon forces, never knowing whether the latest disaster was an accident or sabotage, and trying to figure out which your friends aren't who they seem. All the mechanics of the game work together to perfectly capture the theme. The only downside to the game is its length: At about 3 hours per game, it's not going to hit the table with my group nearly as much as I'd like.

RATING: 7.5
(08/20/09) - Despite needing at least 4 to really get the most out of this experience, I have faith that I will either find enough to enjoy it or will make it work with just 3!

(05/22/13) - [7.5] - After three plays of BSG (with a range of three to five players), I am assigning a 7.5 rating. As one of my playing partners described it: "there's a lot of noise while you play, but not a lot of action". The base game seems to devolve into skill check after skill check, and it is hard to immerse yourself when the goal becomes diluted down to "we need X green and yellow", repeated dozens of times. The Cylon aspect is very enjoyable, but with only three or four players it turns into the Cylon laying as low as possible for the majority of the game. A more active traitor makes for a more exciting game, but it is simply too easy to deduce the Cylon during skill checks with less than five players.

SOLD (04/14/2017) - I'd love to think that one day I will find a consistent group of 4 other players to enjoy this title with, but it hasn't happened in ~9 years, with not much chance of that changing. The theme adds another obstacle to introducing new groups as well.

Far superior to the other "traitor" game it gets compared to, Shadows Over Camelot. I don't find the skill checks to be boring at all, and reading the other players to figure out who's a cylon (especially since by the second half of the game you KNOW you have one) is a blast. There's almost always something for everyone to do. Very rarely is a turn "wasted" the way it is in Shadows Over Camelot.

Such a good game. 

After playing with expansions, I can see that the base game has a weak mechanic in the sympathiser. The humans can always "rig" the game to get him on their side. When he is on the cylon side, the sympathiser is a very weak character and has a very dull gameplay after being revealed.

Apart from that, I always signed up for games when giving the option. The traitor mechanic works beautifully and it is always a very difficult battle to win the game!

An absolute gem!

The game got off to a bad start for me when I discovered that it was based on the new Battlestar Galactica TV series and not the original with Lorne Greene as Commander Adama.
 
Its not that hard to figure out who the Cylon is with some random coloured cards being played to stop or assist some events that will effect the ship. 

I just wished when you became the Commander you could nuke your own battlestar and save yourself a good 3-4 hours tedious gameplay.

Basado en la nueva serie del mismo nombre (para nosotros una de las mejores series de todos los tiempos). .Juego de identidades ocultas con votaciones también ocultas sobre decisiones que pueden cambiar el transcurso de la historia. Trata de llegar a Kobol antes de que uno de los 4 recursos se agote. Lo mejor es que a mitad de viaje, puedes ser activado y cambiar de bando.

Based on one play.  We had a hard time collectively figuring out the rules together, and as a result our game dragged.  I think with good teacher learning shouldn't be that bad.  The game seems to promise a great treachery experience, though I can also see that it may be a little boring with all the "skill checks".  I'm very interested playing again to firm up my opinion.

We played this for the first tme and even with having to sort out the rules and mechanics it was still a good time.  We hope the next time we play it speeds up a bit.  There is some downtime. We played this a fourth time with the Pegasus Expansion and it was not much fun at all ... it just dragged, too many fiddly rules and too easy to make a mistake.  We seemed to spend forever looking up rules.

RATING: 7
rating after 1 play (5pl) - NA

got a major rule wrong regarding population loss so game was odd cos so bad for humans from start 2 cylons (inc self) felt little need to detrimentally interject which led to little suspicion so times between battles felt a little flat - will reserve judgements till next play but have some doubts...

rating after 2plays (5pl) - 8/9

we didnt shuffle crisis cards properly so was AGES before they came up and then all came up together. also our 1st crisis card failed and meant noone cld look at any loyalty cards for rest of game which was odd but either way was a lot of fun. more plays will reward cos of knowledge of decks which is key eg if ur trying to decide if admiral is good or not u need to know what the range of jump cards is

rating after 4 plays - all 5pl - 7ish

got the chance to play a couple of games in quick sucession and i really dont know about this game - it takes 4+ hours BUT never feels like it drags but i dont think it needs to be that long - 3+ wld be much better. the suspiscion element is nice but there just isnt enuff to do - new players constantly ask what they are supposed to be doing when theyre are no cylon ships on the board and i never know what to say to them cos there is v little to do. also there is a LOT of dice rolling and this will prob decide the game, either im missing something or there is no real game here - having said that cos of the theme its somehow fun to play but im yet to be convinced y this is so loved 

(btw i really like saboteur and shadows over camelot and BG the tv series so this SHOULD be perfect for me)

WEIGHT
rules - 3/4 - quite tricky to teach
play - 3
master - 3/4 ttricky to rate this cos is all about playing the opponents which is as deep as it gets btu is v random

I can't get over how fun this game is. I am not a fan of liscensed games and never have been. I love Star Wars but hate the idea of Star Wars board games. I love LOTR but hate the idea of LOTR board games. This game OOZES theme and takes similar mechanics from Shadows over Camelot and makes them better. The paranoia this game brings to the table is great!! If you haven't played this game, do so.

purchased 12/2010... it's "in the mail." I just started watching the newer BSG series for the first time. No interest in watching the first series (those robes... can't handle it). Totally hooked on the newer series and then I started reading about the board game... MUST HAVE NOW! I think I'll be able to talk my wife into trying but then we'll need to draft a kid or 2 as it appears to be pretty much useless as a 2 player game.

Secret Santa Gift which was perfect for me as I was curious about the game but unlikely to get it myself.  

I like cooperative, thematic games such as this and Arkham Horror.  For some reason, Shadows over Camelot never really appealed to me.  (I suspect the skill checks - sets of cards didn't quite work there for me.)  Back to BSG - this game shines with 5 or 6 players.

With more players, skill cards become more critical as they can run out before you can draw more.  A full game (humans reaching earth) isn't that long - about 3 hours, so a game that is easily played in an evening even with 6 players.

Only played once so my rating may change but I doubt it'll raise above a 6. I found it to be pretty bland. You do the same thing over and over again and it gets a bit old after 3 hours of the same thing.

Even though the cylon was found out early, the humans still lost horribly. What's the point in finding the cylon if you get slaughtered anyway?

I found the theme to be a fun aspect of the game. The long wait between turns and the significant burning of cards in other player turns, along with limited options on specialty cards made it a little monotonous. Maybe those are improved in the expansions. 

At this point this wouldn't be in my top choices to play if I were given other options.

Meh.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Not my type of game: (1) I'm not so into cooperative/team games. (2) There's no real planning, just reacting to a long series of random events that lasted way too long in the slow group I played with. (3) Lots of discussion about who might be a Cylon, acting/roleplay to look innocent and cast suspicion on others, voting/debating about other issues, etc which is hard for me in Polish... 

But I was glad to try it to see what it's like, as it's quite popular and clearly has some clever ideas. The card play system is a good elegant variation of the failure cards from Kill Dr. Lucky, and it works well. The basic mechanics are simple and ultimately not so interesting - the point of the game is the suspicion and negotiation and paranoia and discussion. I would probably enjoy it a lot more if (1) I played in English or Esperanto instead of Polish and (2) all players were faster and more focused. My first game lasted roughly 5 hours, and that's just too long for this.

To enjoy the core experience (secret traitors thwarting the shared goal), I recommend the much shorter card game [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9220/saboteur]Saboteur[/url] - it's small, easy to teach, and lasts a half hour instead many hours.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Wow!  Very faithful to the show, still enjoyable if you know nothing about the show, very atmospheric and lots of interaction.  Seems to scale well to various numbers of players, though I haven't played enough to know for sure.  The main downside is game length.  Three hours is a long time, especially against those with AP.  If there were a way to shorten this to two hours consistently, it would see a lot more of table time.

Good game with the betrayal mechanics. I feel the Dead of the Winter perfected this game in many ways, so I sold my copy.
Still recommended for anyone with the love to the series and/or when the Z-theme is not your cup of tea.
Couple of points down due to the situations when you sitting doing nothing on your turn because crises cards are not THAT hard to overcome.

RATING: 8.5
I really enjoy this game. I do. It's only problem is it's too complex for most. The game just has so much going on that it offers many problems.

1. Lack of attention. I hate it when people don't pay attention during games. Texting, talking about something other than the game, or just not paying attention in general. But in this game it bothers me more than anything else. Why is that? Because this is a game that thrives on table talk about the game. 

2. Lack of caring. If someone doesn't care about a game and how they do, it doesn't matter usually. I can play a game of Race for the Galaxy against someone who really doesn't care about the game that much and doesn't try and still get enjoyment out of it. But in this game, if one or two players just don't care, the game falls apart.

Enjoyment in this game is heavily weighed on the players and their attitude. 

I wish I could get this to the table more.

RATING: 9
(2 plays) At the moment, I'm still enjoying playing it a lot. I'm worried, though, by its tendency to fall into lulls without much action (e.g. when there are no Cyclon ships on the board) and everyone is basically sitting around waiting for either the jump counter to progress or (if they are Cyclons) for a Cyclo ship to show up, both of which are out of their control.  If games with lots of these lulls prove more common than not, my rating could drop substantially.

We're adding expansions each game as if we're playing the story in show seasons. I think I'll raise my rating for this each time I play I enjoy it so much. It's a long game but as long as you stay on top of your players it should keep rolling through.

--Nov2008-- (After one play.)  My colleagues tell me that the game is very thematic.  Yet as I'm not a fan of the series (either old or new), I couldn't tell.  It seemed long and random to me, with significant downtime between opportunities for decision.  I'd be content to play again, should it become the consensus for an evening's entertainment.  But I can't imagine suggesting it.
(Not any better on the second play.  There seems to be about a half hour's interesting game here, smeared out over three or four hours of not-terribly-interesting game mechanics.  I suspect I'm just not the target audience.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
While I enjoy cooperative games, I am too competetive to feel like playing them a lot.  With the recent crop of popular Co-op games, i didn't expect to particularly enjoy this one. 

What a surprise.  I really feel like this is the best marriage of theme and game play that I have seen in a co-op. The other co-ops are great, don't get me wrong, but;
•Pandemic can turn to shit on you with a simgle card draw, and the theme isn't very deep.
•Ghost Stories is also a little abstract and the win condition just makes it feel like a hyped up tic-tac-toe.
•Shadow over Camelot is entirely too scripted and 
•Lord of the Rings is good, but not too thematically deep.

Battlestar Galactica is VERY thematic, (so if you havn't seen the series, your going to be a bit lost.) I also think that the traitor mechanic in this one is particularly clever...  one player, if smart, can effectively screw with the game the entire time, making an already hard to win game nearly impossible unless the other players can thwart him/her.

The Crisis card give this a massive amount of replayability.

Great game.

A game based on the TV-series that Sheldon like most... The story happens in the future, when the earth dies and the last humans escapes into the space. However, the aliens find them and are about to give them the last blow. All players shall cooperate with each other and stop the aliens ('The Cylon', said Sheldon). The meat of the game is that there is one player acting as a Cylon (a spy, but no one knows he is), and, in the middle of the game, another player will become a Cylon, too! (Gene mutation or whatsoever) It adds conspiracy into the pure cooperation. Unfortunately I have no interest in sci-fic, so sorry for the low rating.

Not sure how much of my like for this title is due to my fanboy status.  Ah well.  Frak the toasters, anyway!  First time we played, after about 7 turns with successive jump-prep conclusions, I muttered something like "Wow we must be missing something" or "Jeez, this game seems kinda...easy."  Little did I know we were just getting very lucky cards, because suddenly we were getting boarded tagged and bombarded from all sides, couldn't jump, couldn't repair, a Cylon revealed himself and left the ship to wreak further havoc and we were trying to figure out which horrible loss was more likely to allow us to just last long enough to jump one more time.  I haven't stopped thinking about this game for the 3 days since we played it!

The great thing about this co-op game is that not everyone is working together. This changes the game from a solitaire experience to a trust game. For the best experience players need to realize that it doesn't always benefit them to help in the beginning half of the game, because they may become a cylon in the latter half. Otherwise, I find the humans will usually win.

The system in this game, in which you play cards secretly into a pool to affect the result while trying to also be subtle and avoid detection, is neat, but feels like the activity of an hour rather than the hours-long game that it was.  I found that most turns were not very interesting, as the course of action was clear (move to the room to advance the current goal of the team), and the card-playing event was the only interesting bit.  Over so many rounds, it didn't remain very exciting.  However, I'd like to try this game at least once more.

I shouldn't like this game: I don't like co-ops or team games, don't like games that play longer than 2 hours and don't like variable player powers. And yet, I've really enjoyed this game almost every time I've played. 

It's biggest downside for me is that, because of the high level of interaction and communication, some players outright ruin the game. Teaching takes a long time because of all the hidden information and mistakes made by new players often throw off the balance, but that seems thematic at least. There are however certain players who are too dominating or critical or analytical who I simply won't play with, and has led to me playing this much less.

3-6 player, Light-Medium Coop w/ Traitor
The hidden traitor is what makes this game!  Once they are uncovered it is definitely less interesting, but the ride up is fraught with enjoyable paranoia.  It is even better if people will role play

Nagyon erős tematikus játék, ahol minden játékelemet tudatosan úgy alkottak meg, hogy erősítse a bizonytalanságot és a gyanakvást! Amikor éppen nem űrcsatázol, akkor javítod a  hajót, különböző kríziseket oldasz meg, majd egyszer csak rád fogja valaki, hogy áruló vagy és már be is csapták mögötted a börtönajtót... aztán a játék felénél újabb hűségkártyát kapsz, kiderül, hogy alvó ügynök vagy, és azt kívánod, bárcsak tényleg szabotáltad volna a munkát. Fantasztikus játék, de csak komoly érdeklődőknek! Vigyázat... 3-4 óra is benne lehet, ha sok a trash-talk! :)

The best hidden traitor game I've played. It can be tough for players to "keep a straight face" as a cylon for a whole game, but when its done well the betrayal is so sweet.

I've played with the expansions and I don't really recommend them. Yes, they add more iconic characters and plot points from the show, but they add options and play time that really aren't needed.

RATING: 10
Perfection. Perfect matching of theme and mechanics, highly engaging gameplay (that keeps you invested even on other players' turns) and plenty of room for subtle play and strategy.

DoW is the new hotness, but it just doesn't have the room for subtle play and deduction like BSG does. Accept no substitutes for the king of hidden traitor games.

因为爱游戏而去看美剧，当时并没有玩过，只是觉得二度觉醒的机制很牛逼，于是看完了四季并不怎么中意的科幻题材美剧，没想到美剧大赞；反过来就更爱这个游戏了。虽然2009在老GEEK活动时看朋友开过至今还没正式开过一局完整的。。。

RATING: 9
This game is an absolute gem. It feels exactly like playing through a new episode of the show, with all the drama and twist and turns. There's always surprise reveals, and despite the long play time (six hours with a leisurely group) it's a crowd-pleaser.

It does need a lot of help from later expansions to balance out some of the issues, and I have yet to try anything but the Kobol ending (I keep winding up with some new players at the table).

RATING: 6
I like that this feels different than some of the other hidden traitor games I've played, but ultimately it takes FAR too long for what it is.  The first game I had took roughly 4 hours and while it was semi-interesting, there are a lot of ways where you might be severely limited for a good chunk of that time (e.g. thrown in the brig).  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
This one really depends on the players. You need people who are willing to enter into the accusation-counter-accusation spirit of the game. Perferably those who've seen the series.

That said, I do think that the mechanics are a little pedestrian for actual gameplay, and it's one of the few games where I feel the expansion actively detracts from many of the game's strengths. The game tends to drag towards the end, unless a very smart Cylon player is keeping things interesting. 

As a result, the game can be great, but it relies entirely on this social aspect to get the game going - which to me means that it must be remembered though it can be an amazingly fun game... so can munchkin...

More than any other, this is the game that led me to fall in love with board games (thanks Spoony).

The hidden loyalties are so tense and thematic, and games usually feel on a knife's edge right until the end -- pretty impressive with so many moving parts. The expansions were expensive and only add complexity but the better modules are (probably) worth it.

This is my "event" game. It runs long and will take a while before your group can speed through it.

Good game.
Only 1 play thought it was very well done with good amount of strategy for a coop game.  Need a few more playes to see if it holds up.

Second play and it went up and down for me.
The game was incredible fun with lots of jokes and back bitting.  Noah played a amazing Cylon Baltor that claimed Admiral/President Cain was a Cyclon with his Cyclon detector.  The game also dragged on some what long and the play can be tedious, I need to try it with all experienced players.

One of FFG 2000s forefront games, it puts you deep in the famous series and manages the feat to induce the same kind of paranoia as in season 1.

Mechanics are functional and (somewhat) stick to the theme, thx for the engineering talent of Corey Konieczka.

Not sure if the game is attractive to people who don't know the series though. But the game stands to itself. A masterpiece.

Hidden traitor games are not much my thing. I dislike having a random card draw dictate if I have to work against the group or not and have to do so secretly to be in spirit of the game. This one is just oh so much worse than others in the genre because it drags on for far too long.

So glad that our friends' picked this up.  It's a great game, fun and tense with rules that seem to run supa-smooth.  If I could make just one complaint, it'd be that I don't think that I like the "Brig" location - any mechanic that has the potential to lock a player out of most of the game (and to keep them out of the fun) probably won't end up being a favorite of mine.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The best execution of a theme in any game I've played.

Everything in this game feels like Battlestar Galactica; the tension, the Cylon ships appearing, the slow loss of resources, and of course the paranoia of who is a Cylon agent. The implementation of the sleeper agents is also ingenious, you start to dread: 'Am I actually a Cylon'.

This does not mean the game relies on just fans. I've played this game mostly with people who have never seen the series - and it goes down very well - the mechanics and tension are appreciated on their own.

The rule book is not the best, it is actually fairly annoying when you are learning the game or checking up a rule. Saying that all of the rules themselves (once you learn/find them) make sense and there is very little 'what happens now'-situations.

It is a long game, but it is meant to, rarely do we have a game when you feel like it should have ended a lot earlier.

Not sure on how balanced it is, as I don't really keep count of who wins and I think in a game like this it doesn't really matter, the only thing that matters is what you felt when you played it and if you have a story afterwards.

Seems to offer a significantly greater feeling of control and options than Shadows over Camelot, and much more thematic too. Can be enjoyable with five or fewer players keeping the tempo up and game time down to under two hours. Try and avoid playing with slow players or those who like to take back turns - it must be played at a good clip with everyone just enjoying the story arc. Don't bother with the expansions - they just make the game drag on longer without adding anything except more of the same. Not sure if I would find it nearly as playable if I hadn't watched the series.

A cooperative game with a nice blend of innovative (space fighting being the most evident) and known (specially the traitor mechanic) ideas and lots of theme.  Speaking of theme, it is better that the players get involved with it in order to make the game really fun.  The humans need to play real well to take a chance; if so, it is a very tense game.  I don't rate it better only because there are people that I probably don't bring the game on, but away from that I'd be willing to play it when opportunity knocks.

Never have I been so conflicted in my opinion of a game. We played two back-to-back games with the same six people—no one was the same character and we swapped out seats.

There’s a LOT of good stuff here. 

The theme is well done. The characters are very distinct. Each one has a special power, a once-a-game bigger power, and a weakness. So Roslin can look at the top two cards of the Crisis Deck (Bad Things) and decide which to implement and which to put on the bottom. Her weakness is that she’s “sick,” so has to discard two cards to activate a space. Tighe’s weakness is Alcoholism, so if he ever only has one card in his hand, he has to discard that one, too. So the people have specific traits that fit them—though very abstracted. 

You face some of the same challenges that they face in the show: food shortages, attacks, Cylons boarding the ship. You’re trying to jump away from the Cylons, so cards slowly allow the FTL drive to ramp up, and when it’s far enough along you can attempt to jump early--but at the risk of losing population because you leave ships behind. Or you can wait a bit longer and auto-jump. But the longer you wait the more you’re getting beat up by Cylon ships. It’s a cool gamble. Our second game came down to one die roll. The humans were down to 3 population, but really had no choice but to try to jump early. They rolled a D8, and on a 1-6 they’ll lose 3 population (and thus the game). If they roll a 7 or 8 they don’t lose any pop and win the game. They rolled an 8 and went NUTS. It was a great gaming moment (even though I was a Cylon and lost).

The Loyalty idea is cool--particularly the fact that a new set is dealt out halfway through the game. In our first game, no one was a Cylon until the second half; then we had two. In the second game there was one from the beginning, one at the halfway, and then I was a Sympathizer halfway, and since the humans were winning I became a revealed Cylon. As in most games of this type, being the traitor is fun. 

I have never felt such a sense of paranoia as in this game. Part of it was that our group really knows each other well, so there was a lot of smack-talk and goofing around. But everything is scrutinized, and there’s a lot of opportunity for sabotage. You can throw bad cards into skill checks to hose the deal, and people can’t be sure who did it because there are two random cards thrown in that could be any color, and all cards are shuffled before you look at them. And you can start throwing blame around: “Hey, that blue card really hurt us. And so-and-so is the only person who draws blue cards...” No one trusted anyone--it was [i]awesome[/i]!

But the bad:

First, it’s long. Way too long. Each of our two games took around 3 hours--with fast players. This might be forgivable if there was more to do when it’s not your turn, but there’s a lot of downtime. This would obviously be different with fewer players, but I wonder how in the world you’d pass some of those skill checks with only 3 people...especially with one person being a Cylon.

The cards are pretty boring. There are only a couple variations in each color, but much of the time they weren’t interesting enough to use (other than reroll cards, and help-pass-a-skill-check ones). I also thought the action spaces were pretty boring. “Well, there are no Cylon ships right now, and we’re not damaged. I guess I’ll move here and draw another card.” Yawn. 

I think the game is skewed toward the Cylons. They won in 3 of the 4 games last night, and there was a 75% chance they win in the fourth one, too. Since each person has a specific skill set, it could be that both your pilots in the game end up being Cylons. The humans are screwed if something like that happens. 

I know the ultimate question is whether it was fun, and I have to say: sometimes. Most turns were pretty dang boring. It was more interesting once I found out I was a Cylon, and then when the game moved into the End Phase we were all pretty involved. But that was after two-and-a-half hours of not-exciting gameplay (but way fun paranoia and finger-pointing). 

Before I played I thought I’d probably end up buying this. Now I know I won’t. I’ll play someone else’s copy, but it would have to be with the right group--and I’d have to be prepared for 3 hours of one okay game.

The game actually introduced me to the series which I love *almost* as much. Finding out who is a cylon is a priority right after staying alive and, oh yeah, you gotta win the game. (Which I don't think our group has done yet - 10/12/09... [yes we 'the humans' have - 12/4/09!])  
Humans lost on 1/17/11 at 7 points.  Close one but President Cylon Dobi did us in early on.
Best with experienced players as choices in the game are really made individually and with lots of nuance.

Picked up in like new condition from Craig's List.  Wasn't too thrilled with the game for the first hour as it seemed slow and we got lucky draws with little resistance from the Cylons.  It got better as the tension built towards the end and we were trying to figure out who the Cylon players were with only two food left before we died.  In the end I like the game, I just wish it played a little shorter.  I would play again, but also open to selling this if someone really wanted it.  I'm not the biggest coop fan.

Takes a long time to explain all the mechanics, have had a number of games with accidental -oh I just played all the wrong cards at a critical moment and hosed everyone- or -oops I just revealed I was a cylon at the wrong time- from new players to this game.  The mechanics are more of a necessity of secrecy than they are inherently entertaining.

In short this game lives or dies on the group you play with and how much they get into the meta-game and characters.  So I've had some thrilling matches, and some long matches of woe fraught with arguments and mistakes.

Incredible game. BSG can generate some of the very best game-playing experiences. The tense suspicion and paranoia of unknown Cylons is riveting. The fleet undergoes crisis after crisis, moving the game along pretty well most of the time. Perhaps the best integration of theme and gameplay that I have seen. The only knocks are the occasional lulls (good times for infighting!) when a cylon fleet is absent and the time commitment of 4 hours.

The only thing I like about this game is the prospect of using Cally to shoot someone in the head. 

In many ways this game suffers from the opposite of the problems that Shadows over Camelot has. The game is too hard (for the humans), but manages to be fairly thematic. I don't like the card mechanic for resolving events, but whatever. It seems like it should be more fun to be a cylon, but you don't get to do as much as a cylon. I don't know, neither side feels like they have much control, and I've been generally unsatisfied with the experience.

RATING: 9
Battlestar Galactica is the only game I have ever played for four straight hours without once feeling bored. At the beginning of the game, everyone is on edge because some players might be cylons, and by the point the cylons reveal themselves, everyone is so invested in the game that outcome is crucially important. The skill checks do an excellent job of providing information about possible cylons as well as keeping all players engaged even on off turns.

A couple of the mechanics have minor issues. The crisis deck has a great deal of variability in the level of damage it can do to the humans' cause. Cards that cause ships to be put out are particularly annoying to deal with, and very large or very small concentration of those at any point in the game can be enough to decide the winning team. Generally, when I play a game, I never want to feel like I won or lost because of random card draws, so this is a problem.

Another small problem with the game is the sympathizer identity card. The card only affects one person, but it kind of sucks the fun out of the game for that person. Therefore I always try to play Battlestar with exactly five people, which significantly reduces the number of plays it would get if I felt it worked well with four or six.

This is also a game that requires a fairly experienced group of players. It can be difficult to play as a cylon your first game, so it's best to have players who have played other hidden role games and are comfortable with bluffing.

I adore this game. One of the best I've ever played. The only (very valid) complaints that I'd like to echo are that the game is much easier for the cylons than for the hoomans, and that at an average 3-ish hours, you have to be prepared for a long night.
As usual, the instructions leave a lot of be desired. There are some great videos out there explaining play that I preferred to learn from. I'm a visual learner, so that may be the main issue.
Otherwise, once you become an experienced player, and have an experienced group, this can be a ton of fun. The adherence to theme in the game is one of the best I've ever seen, to the point that I can't help quoting the show while playing. But I suppose that's the same as everybody else, right?

Nice semi-cooperative game. As someone who watched and liked the show, it's fairly easy to get into. Deceit, bad faith and roleplay are mandatory to make the game fun, otherwise it falls flat on its face. I wouldn't play it with anyone.
In the long run, the pace of the game is very random. The game can drag for an hour without anything interesting happening (aka "The Love Boat") and suddenly go super hectic (aka "Titanic"), or vice versa. Some games are very funny, others are utterly boring. For a game this long, this is a problem.

[imageid=752292medium]
This is my favorite of the hidden loyalties genre, as it strikes the best balance between free-form deduction and game-mechanical structure (since Werewolf-style free form can often go too out of hand and depend on the play group). Battlestar Galactica is my favorite TV show, and the board game does more than justice by conveying the tension, paranoia and gritty atmosphere, in addition to porting key events in the show through event cards. Is this the first ever game that does justice to its license? There's Dune, but this might be the first that captures the spirit of a TV show so well.

The weakness with hidden loyalties is the game can get boring or drawn out once you are exposed (hence it's better for the game to be short). BSG runs against type by offering >3 hours playtime, and can be subject to this, but combats it by offering many choices, and the innovative Destiny Deck mechanism. There are many ways to frak with the other side and sow confusion, many opportunities to interpret signals, many ways to frak with them mentally and spitefully, and many things still to do once your mind is somewhat made up.

The gameplay can definitely feel a little rote if the loyalties are revealed early. But the strongly integrated theme allows me to overlook this, and nearly every deficiency with this game.

Now that the arc is likely complete, the Base Game remains at a 9 due to lack of variety and some 'solvability', but the entire series is a definite, true 10, capped by the amazing Daybreak expansion. There are so many options and sandbox-element cards that no two plays will ever feel the same again.

Guaranteed 2 cylons. No Pegasus in order to get rid of Airlock and to give cylons an advantage after taking away the CFB. The thematic bonus of no Pegasus going to Earth is just gravy.

[b]2. Expert:[/b] Destination = Ionian Nebula, every single module. No guarantee of 2 cylons, but maximum ability to cycle the Loyalty Deck (via Airlock, Personal Goals, disaster tokens and executions with Nebula etc).

3. Intermediate: (because everybody insists on the CFB but isn't experienced enough for the Nebula...) Destination = Kobol, every module, but Conflicted Loyalties and Loyalty +1 are optional. Recommend CL for 6er Mutineer (a little harder to let the cylon be the last card, + make it a little harder for humans). Recommend doing Loyalty +1 pre-sleeper if not using.

Also, Beginner is more suitable for 5-player while Expert is more suitable for 6-player (where Treachery/Mutiny kicks into overdrive, there is rule complexity from the Mutineer/Cylon Leader, and you need 4 potential human turns in between the 2 Basestar Bridge turns). And consider banning Political Prowess for Expert (due to Airlock availability) but not Beginner.

[u]House-Rule Considerations[/u] (in decreasing order of priority)
1. [b]Ban Cain[/b] aka Scout + Blind Jump cheese. C'mon, she was only in like 2 episodes. Added bonus of actually giving a reason to pick Adama. Negotiable if going to Earth.
2. [b]Ban Cally[/b]. Nobody else has that good a combo of ability + miracle, and her presence makes the game less fun for everybody (totally disrupting unrevealed-cylon strategy).
3. [b]Protect unrevealed cylons from disasters[/b] with Ionian Nebula. Just ruins it for everybody when an unrevealed cylon trips the mine, especially if through no fault of his own. Favor letting humans and unrevealed simply toss disasters away (HARDENED) when they draw them or shuffle and draw an extra Loyalty Card.
4. [b]Tory's ability requires Consolidate Power[/b]. Else her power is out of whack compared to other card-draw characters.
5. For Crossroads, [b]don't eliminate, just execute[/b] (and don't shuffle an extra card into Loyalty). For revealed cylon, this additionally means dropping his/her Super Crisis Card(s).

Political Prowess isn't so bad when Pegasus is often destroyed (so no Airlock), and the new Treachery/Mutiny makes people come in and out of the Brig so much that the one skill check it's used on becomes less pivotal. Plus Change of Plans.

Does a truly amazing job of capturing the gist and psychology of the TV series with a relatively slim rule set. A game that doesn't try to club you in the head with clever innovative mechanics, but rather pushes things forward along the social axis.

This game is absolutely amazing. The expansions somehow manage to add even more depth, intrigue, manipulation, and suspense to a game that is already chock-full of all of this. The Cylon mechanic is particularly amazing.

I highly recommend playing the game with at least the Cylon Basestar expansion from Exodus and the Pegasus ship from the Pegasus expansion. Otherwise, the game can get a little bit boring for Cylon players (once revealed) and they can feel 'left out'. Humans win about 15-20% of the time, and games have taken anywhere from 2.75 hours to up to 6 hours.

I have not played with the Cylon Leaders mechanic, but am looking forward to adding that in to the mix as well.

Cooperative games are games I can generally tolerate.  However, cooperative games with a traitor element are not generally going to be games I enjoy.  This one adds to that by making the traitor(s) appear halfway game.  That pretty much amplifies all of the things I dislike about cooperative games with traitors.  Granted, this seems to be totally thematic, but it really takes away from the game for me.  [06/28/2009]

Brainless game of cooperative play, tons and tons of randomness, and talking; there's no long term strategy or thinking involved. The game also completely lacks balance - roles are either very strong or very weak, so for the good guys 1-2 people play the game and the rest executive-order them because that's best for the team; playing a cylon, after discovery, feels completely disconnected from the good guys' play - you might as well be playing alone against an automaton. One time I won as cylon leader by sitting around in jail 80% of the game doing petty things, because my victory condition was for one side to win while I am in jail. Nonsense.

Oh yeah, forgot to add. It also takes forever (and I'm the guy who likes Game of Thrones and Mansions of Madness)

Argh.

Seriously, these "traitor games" can't seem to get it right. 

1 - BSG - 30 minutes of psychology and deceit and treachery in a 180 minute game, overbloated with mechanics and details and stuff and nothing moves at any pace but glacial. 
2 - Resistance at least last only 30 minutes, but lacks narrative and dramaturgy 
3 - Panic Station - does a whole lot of story in 60 minutes, has tension, the whole narrative is player driven. BUT half finished product with thematic holes the size of Jupiter, an identity crisis and crashes as easily as Windows Vista when it came out. 
4 - Note to self - have to try Dead of Winter, but not in a rush...

So back to BSG. I dunno. It just drags. Supposedly it all makes sense if one watched the show, which I didn't. It's better if players know one another and create a good shared atmosphere, but, too much "thematic elements" (literally, each has a card and a counter and a page in the rulebook), too much overhead. If one wants to create the kind of atmosphere this advertises then lower overhead please. A bloated hogzilla.

I think watching the TV series is what drew me into this game. Once you break it down I am not sure if the game length justifies the overall decisions each individual player is making. At the end of the day it is still a great sci-fi cooperative with an interesting traitor element.

This has to be one of the most entertaining and downright HILARIOUS group games I have played to date. The chatter between players and random baseless accusations of being a cylon are epic. The gameplay is great and the theme is spot on for the show. But the sheer interaction between players is what makes this a winner. It doesn't matter if your friends throw you out the airlock and say you were a cylon... you will still love this game.

Update: I've played this game several more times since my review and it holds. The game is a fantastic group game if only for the chatter that it creates. I cannot say enough good things about this one.

A cooperative game with the added intrigue of traitors (cylons) in the mix. The possibility of alliances shifting halfway through the game keeps the suspicion alive. The actual game play is rather superficial - the real fun is had while trying to figure out who is a cylon and who is a human. I think the actual on board game play in Shadows Over Camelot (another cooperative game with a traitor) is superior, while Battlestar Galactica has the edge in interaction. 

In Shadows, an early traitor reveal removes a lot of the suspense from the game. Then you just play through to the end - not everyone will find what is left meaningful enough to keep their interest. This problem is avoided in Battlestar because the mid-game possibility of an additional traitor being added keeps the suspicions going, avoiding the possibility of playing for a substantial duration with all loyalties known. Having said that, both games are fun and choosing between the two probably comes down to preference for theme - knights of the round table vs. science fiction.

UPDATE: I can't remember how long our SOC games took, but BSG has taken around 4 hours or so every time. That's just too long.

RATING: 7
[1 play] We had a very enjoyable 6 player learning game. This is the best themed semi-cooperative game I've tried so far. The mechanics of the game work well to immerse the players in the experience - much more so than the "forming poker hands" which occurs in Shadows Over Camelot. The "traitor" mechanism is also much improved in my opinion - although I will say that I would recommend 5 players over 6 - to speed up the game just a bit and to eliminate the sympathizer card, which seems to reduce the fun for one player in the second half of the game.

Overall very pleased and looking forward to more of this one - something I could never say wholeheartedly about Shadows or Red November.

Most recent play 1-2-09 with Michael, Donovan, Andy, Joel, and Brian Rowe.

SO SAY WE ALL!! Frak yes, BSG! I get pumped up just thinking about this game. It's that awesome. I will say that you do need to play with a good group though- probably people you know well. I have had a couple lackluster experiences that I mainly attribute to the group dynamic. I would love to find a regular local game group just to play this game a lot. I like it more than the Resistance because I find the game mechanics to be intriguing. The theme interests me as well due to being a fan of the show. Yes, it's certainly a longer social deduction game, but it's longer because it's EPIC! So much potential for amazing stories and moments of glory and horror when it comes to this game. I LOVE IT.

RATING: 9
FFG wraps Werewolf in a BSG shell...and it works. Players are members of the BSG and have to use skill sets (and attendant cards) in order to deal with crises that come their way.

Add in the fear and paranoia of possible cyclons on the ship...that's when things start to get hairy. The mechanics are nothing new but are quite faithful to the original show. The way players commit face down cards to deal with problem cards is clever: and something other similar games should have done.

Only gripe is the long playtime. There should be a time limit on discussions to speed things up. But otherwise, fun fun fun!

Played tens of times.

Nice co-op game with traitors (essentially a team game where loyalties are not known at the start).  The sleeper mechanic annoys me, it makes me feel as though I'm playing the first half on autopilot.  The arrangement of the crisis deck can inject a bit too much luck into the game, our group does a "Pandemic-like" shuffle to even out the luck.

Like any team game, it can be annoying if your teammates do things badly (eg. the human who does stupid things and doesn't justify them, or your cylon partner who tries too hard to keep cover and doesn't hurt humans enough).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
A boring game.  The game starts with everyone calling each other a cylon and one person dictating everyone elses actions.  Very little to be engaged with while in the down time and there is a lot of down time when you add the Expansions.  I feel there are better games to play as a coop opportunity that do not suck the life out of a game night or take up the whole game night. If I am to invest the time this game takes to play would rather play a deeper more strategic game like Eclipse, Dominate Species or Twilight Imperium.  This goes for all Battlestar expansions as well don't feel any really breath new life into the game just take more of mine.

RATING: 7
A good game that does a nice job of capturing the theme from the TV series. There is definitely some tension regarding the secret identities of players. My one complaint is that there are often times when there isn't much that is meaningful to do. This is also one of those games in which the experience depends to a large extent on how the players interact with each other.

Exceptional, and great fun to teach. Battlestar, moreso than The Resistance, is an excellent "gateway" cooperative game- whereas The Resistance never really gets any deeper than the Bluff, Battlestar features pretty much the same Bluff along with a very well-designed co-op engine rich with theme and thus serves as not only a great introduction to hobby board games, but also as an excellent co-op strategy game.

I guess the obvious comparison for this semi-cooperative game would be to Shadows Over Camelot.  I've gotten to be a fan of than game.  I think I like the theme better in Shadows Over Camelot, although I guess it actually probably fits better with this game.  In many ways it's the same game.  If you like Shadows Over Camelot, you should probably like this one too.  Trying to be objective, I would say that this game might be a bit better than Shadows Over Camelot but not as good as Shadows Over Camelot with the Merlin expansion.  For my first game almost all of the action took place inside the ship.  The second "cyclon/traitor" card dealing was a nice touch.  I played a four-player game.  I'd like to try it with more players.

DOUBLE MY RATING, IF YOU ACTUALLY LIKE THE NEW BATTLESTAR GALACTICA SERIES.

Nem gondoltam volna, hogy egy táblás játék ilyen tökéletesen adhatja vissza egy film, sorozat hangulatát. Hihetetlen milyen jól visszaköszönnek a sorozat egyes idegőrlő részei. Tökéletes kivitelezés, nagyon jó játékmenet. Ritka az olyan játék, ami igazán megfog, de a BSG 5-6 órai játéka után is újrajátszásra jelentkeztem. Ez mindent elmond.
Negatívum egyedül talán, hogy az adott szereplő számára, adott célterület ellátása a legjobb választás, ez egy kicsit behatárolja az adott játékos tevékenységét, illetve, hogy csak nagy játékosszámmal működik igazán. De ha van 5-6 sci-fi rajongó ismerős, akkor ez a játék kihagyhatatlan!

I love this game in spite of it's faults. Great theme, excellent use of the bluff mechanics. Individual turns go fast so not to much waiting even with 5 players. Manuel is confusing, lots of mechanics. Know the Rules EXTREAMLY WELL before adding new players. This game will build stores to remember with your friends/cylons.

RATING: N/A
Only one play thus far (6p), and not the most enjoyable one. However, I am planning to give it three tries - one 5p, one 3p and one 4/6p, and comment/rate/review after that. 
After that one play, seems a little too Coloretto (collect and discard colour combos), but I suppose a lot is put on the ambience here. 

MAJOR UPDATE: tried it with 5p at a gaming weekend. Easily one of the best gaming sessions I have had, ever. Started at breakfast and played till 5:30pm and I stayed in the Brig for most of the game, after claiming President to go with my Admiral and declaring Martial Law. There were tears, there was laughter, tension, passion and so much metagame it literally leaked into all other games we played that day. Fantastic experience. 
Still it has become even more obvious that the game relies on a good gaming group.

[i]One of the Best and Most Memorable Gaming Experiences Around. Some Ambiguous Communication Restrictions and Uneven Modular Expansion Elements are the Only Mars on this Near Perfect Game System[/i]

[b]Best 5 Player Game Award[/b]

Playing as a Cylon is the most fun I've ever had. Some people criticize this game for putting too much game and  complexity around what should be a simple goal of "find the traitor", but that's actually what I liked about this game compared to the simpler traitor games -- it's more game and less activity.

[b]3 player[/b]: Pretty horrible. Only one Cylon, and skill checks are way too easy to pass because you draw so many cards. Won't play.

[b]4 player:[/b] Better than 3 player, but not as interesting as it can be because there's still only one Cylon. potentially loses a huge amount of intrigue when that one Cylon is revealed. I'd pass.

[b]5 player:[/b] Best player count. Two Cylons and 3 Humans is the perfect balance, without having to use weird bandaids like Sympathizer or adjusted resource dials

[b]6 player:[/b]Pretty good, because there's two Cylons. Balance isn't as good as 5 player. 6 player is better if you want to use Cylon Leaders

[b]7 player:[/b] This feels a little crowded, but still one of the best games ever made so I'll take it. Better than 5 player if you want to use Cylon Leader.

(5 Design + 5 Enjoyment)

[hr]IMO base game becomes sort of routine after you are experienced. It's just too predictable. It's easy to determine the makeup of someone's hand, what they added to skill checks, what cards you're like to draw if you dig the Quorom, etc. All this leaves little room for truly creative or surprising play amongst experts.

The Crisis cards also often end up with the same "bad" or "good" choices from game to game (including whether to tank them or try to pass), etc.

Luckily the expansions save it from having any sort of limit whatsoever on replayability. With the sheer variety the expansions add (3 of them now!), every game and situation is unique, so there are new creative approaches to backstabbing the humans in every game.

All three expansions add a CHUNK of value, in their own way. Though they each have their share of flaws, their scope is large enough that it's just not a problem -- the game even allows you to leave out the bits you don't like. I highly recommend the expansions.

[hr]After playing Secret Hitler, I have cooled off on this a bit as it is no longer the best traitor game I've played. Still great experience with all of the expansions, but I'd probably only rate the base gmae like an "8" now. With ALL expansions it's still a top 10 game.

RATING: 8
The mandatory cylons are a good way to ensure some treachery is involved.  Great components and a pile of cards that pay tribute to the series.  Sadly, there's quite a bit of repetition in the cards, though the game system is pretty clever and situations are quite varied.

Played it at a friends house, and loved it after one round. I constantly wanted to play each time he had us over for games. Finally got my own copy once it came back into print.

The downside of this game is it's length which can be substantial. Outside of that this game does an excellent job of bringing out the Battlestar theme and has my favorite implementation of the traitor mechanic. There are decisions to be made and allegations to be thrown around at every turn so there's very little downtime.

This game was awesome, I love how you don't have to watch the show or know anything about it to have fun. The mechanics were fun and the cylons were awesome (since I was one) I probably wouldn't think the same if I wasn't one but either way I had fun and learned a new game.

RATING: 9
Battlestar Galactica is one of my favorite games. It's another example of gameplay matching the theme perfectly. I had not seen the show the first time I played, but it was still a great experience. The game can run pretty long and that is primarily what keeps it off the table. There are a few expansions, but only a handful of the modules are worth using. I still enjoy this game and will play it whenever, but there are shorter games that deliver an experience that is just as good.

RATING: 8
Nothing new.  No big surprises.  You have a number of different timers manage.  You have to do damage control with abstract colors to manage abstract results.  If you get to zero on any of the timers you lose.  

Repeat. 

Repeat.

Repeat.

For a long time.

So why do I give this an eight?  Well, I like the show and it captures the best parts of the show perfectly (With none of the really, really awful bits).  There is a high level of tension throughout. They got the characters and events spot on.  There is a real feeling of paranoia, and there is some anxiety that comes in during the second phase when you could switch sides.  The push for the jump is exciting as tension builds.  Ultimately, the game is fun, and that counts for quite a bit in my book.

I really only have one significant complaint about the game.  I think the "sympathizer card" is a real bone. If you are a Cylon you get all the choices and all the fun.  If you get the sympathizer card and turned into a Cylon you get shuttled away immediately.  So no having fun bluffing it.  No special Cylon power. No extreme event card.  

Then to make things even less exciting for this player they are limited to only a few Cylon options one often being clearly worse than the others.  So you flip event cards and chose the card that is clearly worse.  This player is more or less effectively eliminated from the game.  It seems to me that they should get some kind of gimme.

This game is really fun, even for people who aren't necessarily fans of the TV Show! I love how it evolves from a coop game into a game of team vs team, when the Cylons finally reveal themselves.

Absolutely brilliant. Replicates the atmosphere of the show perfectly. Everyone spends the entire game paranoid and suspicious which is exactly like the show. Tension builds up as the galactica is surrounded by cylon raiders but the humans jump just at the right moment and then have a moment of peace to recover and repair the ship until they are found again and the raiders begin another attack. I really like the card mechanic in this that allows the hidden cyclon players to secretly mess with the outcomes of each skill check. Can't wait to play it more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good game with some potential.  I like the skill card abilities and range of player options.  A few initial concerns: President seems too powerful, brig seems very difficult to escape, space battles seem too short, and Cylons seem to have trouble recovering when caught.  Would be interested in seeing future games when gameplay might be more balanced.

This is the only game in my collection that, when I plan an event for it with my boardgaming group, gets booked within minutes. This is the ultimate cooperative thematic traitor game and it is a bonus that while it is based on a brilliant TV-show, it is not necessary to enjoy the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Although I usually love co-operative games, this one has such a nasty hidden traitor mechanic to it that it almost offsets the fun of working towards a common goal. Not a reflection on the game's design, just how I like to play. The game does an excellent job of capturing the feeling of hopelessness of the Galactica as it runs from the enemy... the "good" players are constantly losing all the time, just trying to stave off the inevitable. Since in my game session I was not a Cylon agent, I missed any moment of euphoria and felt really worn out by the end (we lost by the way). Maybe that makes for a great theme, but for me it doesn't always make for a fun evening. I think it would go a long way if a few positive events were interspersed with the negatives, just to keep you going. I updated my score recently after having played with the Pegasus Expansion.

This game is insane. When I first got it, it hit the table every week for two months straight. If the theme of the TV show is suspicion and paranoia, then this is the most thematic game of all time. I kind of dislike people calling it a cooperative game or a cooperative game with traitors; it's really a team game with hidden and changing teams. I'm not sure if it will still be hitting the table regularly a year from now, but I've more than gotten my money's worth out of it already.

I love this game.  The game dynamics are among the best of any board game I've played.  The only problem with this game is that I hesitate to bring it out with people who have not watched the show and so lack an understanding and enthusiasm for the theme.  Otherwise, this game is two thumbs up.

RATING: 5
Love the accusations and paranoia, but this is a bit too clunky for me. I would rather spend my time playing 20 games of The Resistance in the time I would have been playing this. Not to mention that with 4 or 6, being the sympathizer kind of sucks. And playing with only 3 isn't that great. So, I guess that leaves 5 players as the sweet spot. But, that's enough to just go play The Resistance. Bleh.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
This is my favourite boardgame. With a traitor mechanism that fosters mistrust and suspicion amongst players, some of which are trying to work together, this game is wonderful in its semi-cooperative nature and the tension in creates in the fight not just against the game but also those trying to destroy you from within. That it well replicates the TV series is an added bonus.

Despite a sense of continuing despair and doom as resources ever dwindle, the game is never over as the humans persevere to snatch victory and the cylons look for the final blow. Human wins are always close and cheered, cylon wins never produce disgust at the game time wasted but with anticipation about how to next defeat the toasters.

Despite the numerous things that can be done in a turn and the various rules that govern the various aspects of the game, they are individually actually not too complex and with repeated plays, can be relatively straightforwardly learnt. 

Obviously with my obsessive stats that I keep, I adore this game!

Interesting game and a must-have for fans of the new show, as it's pretty faithful to it.  It reminds me of the cooperative great Shadows over Camelot, with a sci-fi theme.  The last hour of this was beautifully tense and quite interesting, but the three-hour lead-up was way too long.  I wonder if a future play that was shorter would raise the rating.

UPDATE: Stays where it is, much too long for what it is for me to really want to play it.

It's misleading to say that this is a game based on a TV series. Playing BSG is like recreating the series at home. It's as good as its source material.

Love this one.  It's a 'find the traitor' game but with so much going on you have to always weigh how much trouble it would be, and if it would be worth it to finding them.. just very exciting, always tense fun.  Also love the added bonus of if the traitor really is found they can still play in a very cool way.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Yet another cooperative game, with a really cool theme. For me, though, (first) game play doesn't hold up -- too long, and too many times where you have nothing useful to do. After one play, I prefer Shadows Over Camelot. However, I suspect this is better with more players (except for game length).

Update: after the second play, it was still just OK -- sold off!

There are some really cool mechanisms here:
- 2 loyalty card distributions. Thematically this is very cool. In actual play, though, it didn't add much to the game: it was obvious which player was the cylon.
- several actions available to the revealed traitor
- interesting skill checks (with cards from players and destiny deck). Sounds great, but didn't seem to add much to our game.

On the other hand:
- too long
- several times players were wandering around the ship with few/no useful actions
- too long
- KNOWING there are cylons is less interesting than suspecting. You usually will know the exact number, too (unless one player is dealt more than one cylon card, of course).

RATING: 8.5
If you're into Battlestar Galactica, BUY THIS GAME. If you love games with hidden traitors where the trainer can really get into people's heads and screw with the game plans, BUY THIS GAME. Wild accusations will be flying left and right.

The only down side is that it's a long game & the length really increases per player due to the additional table talk. If there was any way to capture this in a 2 hour experience, it would be my #1 game of all time (and no, Dark Moon doesn't even come close).

This game, along with Kingdom Death Monster, has given me truly "epic" games with highs and lows that have been remembered long after. Not many games can do that, and certainly most Euros don't -- they typically generate post-game discussions and while fun, there's nothing memorable about them.

This is a longer game but the hidden traitor mechanic goes over incredibly well in my gaming group. This is asked for almost every game night.

RATING: 8
In many ways this is an excellent game, with lots of threats to counteract (attacking ships, crisis cards) and lots of suspicion about who is a traitor.  My only reservation is sometimes you can get stuck in the brig for most of the game with not much to do.

RATING: 6.5
No real emotional investment here as I've never seen the show.  Still, it's fun to accuse people of being a psylon (sp?), and the gameplay is pretty fun.  Also, because everyone else I've played it with seems to be really, really into the show, it adds to the fun just to see them enjoying themselves!

Somehow, ending up as Admiral President Starbuck and firing a nuke at the Homestar (er, Basestar) while piloting a Viper was very, very cool.

Update 09/02/2011:  Not sure why I neglected updating this.  Watched the show in its entirety in late '09.  Fun enough game, made infinitely more engaging and enjoyable through knowledge of the show.  Both are flawed beasts, but fun regardless.  One of the better co-ops I've played.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Pros: Interactive, even when it's not your turn.

Accusations flying across the table most of the game.

Cons:  The cylons seemingly have little motivation to not play along nicely until the second set of cards are dealt, making the first half of the game less interesting.

Game length-pretty long for a game where one of the main objectives is trying to determine who the traitors are.  Other games distill this mechanic to a much shorter game time.  If the first half was more engaging, this wouldn't be as much of an issue, but most of the decisions aren't that difficult.

Theme-more of a personal quirk here, but I'm not much of a sci-fi fan and have never watched the show, so the goal and the story behind the characters doesn't mean much to me.  I can see where it would be hugely entertaining if you're a fan.

Cooperative nature-another personal quirk, as most coop games fall flat for me (I do like Terra quite a bit though).  I don't like having to run my decisions by others for approval.  Hell, I have to do that enough in real life! One thing I like about board gaming is the outcome is largely dependent upon my own decisions and strategies and not second-guessed by others.

After sitting in for most of another game, I agree with my initial impression that sci-fi fans will love it.  Others will be mixed depending upon how much game they really think is present behind all the chrome and how much they enjoy longer cooperative games.  Personally, the game fails to capture my imagination and it's WAY too long for the small amount of interesting game play.

I really like this game.  I'm usually either hot or cold when it comes to hidden role games.  For me hidden role games at their purest are awful but I tend to like them when there is another layer of gameplay added.  To that end I really dislike basic Werewolf and The Resistance but don't mind Bang! and now really like Battlestar Galactica.

First of all, probably the best implementation of theme I've ever seen for a board game, and all done without sacrificing gameplay.  I love the show and love how the character cards and their bonuses/penalties reflect the characters from the show.  Even their starting positions, the crisis cards, and that you can't deploy Vipers from one side of Galactica all pull from the show while still working really well for gameplay.

It is an intense and fun coop experience with constant tension since your resources are constantly diminishing as you get closer to your goal and gives you that feeling of treading water with shore just in sight on the horizon.  I love that you can switch sides half-way through the game, some people think this is a crappy mechanic but I think it is original and a lot of fun to all of a sudden have to start trying to sabotage these people you spent an hour trying to get home and, again, it really fits the show's theme.

Finally, the whole game is really well balanced for a game that has so much going on.  And of course the one thing nobody can ever fault FFG on is their production values.  The game is gorgeous and the bits are all solid.

Battlestar Galactica, after 6 plays, rating: 9
Wow, this is it. A new favourite in every aspect. I have played it with a couple of different crowds and every time it’s a blast. The roleplaying part (for those who have seen the series) is the real cherry on the top and makes the paranoid tension a fun part and not just a paranoid tension. The only down part in this game is if you find yourself in jail for turn after turn... And the game is better with 5 players then 3, much better. 
And, by the way, it is frakking hard to beat the frakking Cylons. Humans vs Cylons: 1-5.

I purchased the Battlestar Galactica board game after watching a video review and thinking how interesting the theme of the game was.  I started watching the show after playing the board game.  Now that I've watched through the third season of the show, I really like the board game a lot more.  However the hard part is finding people to play with, since it is quite a lengthy game of at least three hours long.

This game is amazing and one of the most fun "traitor" games. Depending on which modules you play with you could potentially have a big lean towards humans or cylons winning, but with a couple expansions it gets pretty close to 50/50 and is always a fun time with the right group. Especially if you play with hidden information.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Good but over-hyped (and overrated) in my opinion. The cylon factor is the great part, brilliant tie-in with the show, and the rising suspicions of who the secret cylon is make the game. The rest unfortunately falls a bit flat. Seems the most fun is to be had when actually being a cylon otherwise there is next to zero strategy in the game play, several rounds people had nothing to do when no ships attack, so turn after turn one waits for the crisis and tries to pass it. The game flow is really not that great. Not all that complex, but comes with tough decision making once in a while, if that is your thing. A bit too long, too,  for what it is but some seem to like that a lot. I wish I would have been a cylon!  
Played with 5, seemed it works with more but I was under the impression that more would make it even more tedious, more waiting time with nothing to do.

Arguably the best co-op around and the best implementation of the traitor mechanism. Incredibly thematic and doesn't have the puzzle feel as compared to other co-ops.

RATING: 9
A classic thematic intrigue game, Battlestar Galactica matches the theme and plot of the first season of the the modern television show perfectly.  The bluff mechanics and intrigue of the hidden cylon player(s) are extremely fun if handled by an attentive group of players.  The character's special skills are appropriately derived from the show.  The crisis cards are familiar plot devices from the show.  In addition to working as the game's engine, their flavor also greatly enhances the rather basic gameplay.  Hand management, crisis cards that require a choice, and deciding when to reveal when dealt a "You are a cylon" card are the main planning and strategy elements of the game.

This game can be brutal and difficult to win as the human players.  Especially if all of the "You are a cylon" cards are dealt before the sleeper agent phase (the midpoint) of the game.  Also, certain combinations of character types can make it very difficult to win as humans.

I enjoy this game the most with 6 players.  It did not play as well with 3 - 4.  It is currently our gaming group's favorite game if we have 6 players.  I only dock this game a point because it does not hit the table when our group has 4 or 5 players.

Has any game ever captured a theme so well? This is perhaps the greatest licensed game ever made - you definitely feel as if you are living out some of the most tense moments from the show.

However, it isn't all good news. Unfortunately, this game comes with more rules than you can fly a raider through, and much of the game goes slooooooowly as a result. Once the board inevitably fills up with Raiders and Basestars, the game tends to grind to a halt.

In short, if I'm playing with a bunch of BSG fans who will dig the theme, or I'm playing with people who love *mostly* co-operative board games, then this is worth it. However, I can't really recommend it otherwise.

Excellent game, nearly perfect. It has coop, traitor, and team elements. I wish it were only more customizable, expandable, and replayable. As it is, there doesn't seem to be much room for scenario variants and most games follow the same general structure.

Game length is its biggest problem. It's probably the only 2+ hour game that we willingly subject ourselves to.

My first play of this was a terrible experience. Such, that I'm very unlikely to play again. It seemed to take [b]forever[/b] and indeed took about 4 hours. It didn't help that some of the people in the game were getting up and down for various things. Also the person who taught us the game has a terrible grasp on strategy and has seen the humans win only 2 times out of 13 games. We had two pilots but the captain/admiral made sure we stayed away from space combat, ie neutering their special abilities. In the end, I found it a game with few interesting decisions, little fun and not being a fan of the series, nothing worth coming back for.

The biggest positive with this game is how well it invokes the theme of the (modern) TV-series. If you love the series, you'll probably like this game. Some people say the game is great even if you haven't watched the series, but I highly doubt I'd like it as much if I hadn't. I've played this with people who have watched parts of the series, but I'll try my best never to do that again. Having to keep from talking about certain things not to spoil them for other players absolutely sucks! I hope next time I play it, it will be only with people who watched the whole thing.

This seems to have a lot of replayability.

I finally got a chance to play this one. Glad I did, but not my cup of tea. It's a lot about the mental games that are played in the group. I didn't find it incredibly interesting especially for the amount of time it took to play it (3 1/2 hours I think).

I don't doubt that it's a good game if you are into that kind of social deduction thing. I'm just finding I'm more Euro in my game preferences.

The game does do a very good job of capturing the show, but I didn't really like that element of the show either (anyone could be a Cylon, no one is safe). I preferred it when the Final Five (Five?) were revealed and you knew who you could trust and move on from there.

So, my rating might be a little low, but I just don't really want to play this game again.

I love hidden faction social interaction games. Even though I have enjoyed all of my plays of this one and would gladly play again, I know it will not be soon. The length of the game (3 hours with limited instruction) means that it will deter almost everyone from a casual game night. This one is meant for one of those weekend games for a few select friends who decide on what big game to play ahead of time.
In that regard this one fits the bill perfectly.
You don't have to be a fan of the TV series to appreciate the game but it definitely helps with the immersion.
If you're looking for a similar theme and game type that you can fit in under 2 hours, I would suggest Dark Moon.

I'm not sure about my feelings for Battlestar Galactica now. It seems overly long for what it is. Also, we've had quite a few anticlimactic endings. "Oh I guess whichever option we choose on this card we lose." For us, the humans usually lose but rarely go out with a bang.

Although the mechanics of the game are very nice and actually improve the gameplay of Shadows over Camelot, its theme is horrible for me.So much that i don't want to play it!

I would definitely play it more if instead of real actors there were some nice drawings. Ofcourse most people enjoy it exactly for that reason. They like the series and feel in-character when playing the game.

I make a bad Cylon. Playing as a human, I find the slow whittling down of population depressing (especially when you abandon civilian ships in a jump); as a Cylon I find it really hard to sabotage the humans without being either ineffectual or revealing my intentions immediately.

[3 plays] This game reminds me a little bit of Shadows over Camelot only more competitive with more traitors for sure in the game.  Not into the theme very much..  All these games that are cooperative or semi-cooperative seem to have a bit more luck and chaos than I personally like, but they do have good group appeal and I still enjoy them.  All three times I have played the Cylons easily won, not enough games under my belt to decide if it is just bad human strategy or what.  Two games were six players and one played with five players.  The complete dominance from the Cylons in my three players is starting to make me tired of this game.  I have not thrown in the towel yet, but my desire to continue to try it is waning.

I'm giving it a 5 not because it is poorly designed but because throwing in cards every 10 minutes is not my idea of fun.

Battlestar takes the semi-cooperative, "There's a traitor (or two) among us" mystique of Shadows over Camelot and fixes many of the problems with its medieval predecessor. By making the [-]Progression of Evil[/-] Crisis step often a group task, it eliminates the lengthy downtime that can come with games of 5 or more players. By giving Cylons their own section of the board with various powers, it eliminates the often-boring "Add a siege engine, steal a card" revealed-traitor step of SoC. Instead of accusations, people are throwing each other into and out of the Brig left and right, and stripping each other of their titles. The Brig itself is a bit like the Captured! card from Shadows over Camelot: Merlin's Company but without the possibility of throwing a player out of the game for an hour or so by allowing them limited interaction and their own attempts to leave. Making most of the important information on the board (rather than what's in people's hands) makes table-talking much less tempting and necessary-feeling than SoC and keeps people from being mindlessly stuck on the same quest for several turns. Finally, Executive Orders make accomplishing things more possible even when there's five people between you and your next turn. (As an aside, I appreciate that I, someone who has never seen the show, could enjoy this game as much as those who did. Sure, the quotes and flavor text were lost on me, but the game itself was still incredibly fun; I didn't feel left out by my lack of familiarity with the source material at all.)

The game isn't without its flaws. First and foremost, it could've used a few more weeks in playtesting and editing. The rulebook makes finding certain rules a chore, especially since it has one of the most useless indices I've encountered. Some post-publication FAQs REALLY should have been caught before the game came out (how did NO ONE notice the Executive Order loop?). Fighting [-]siege engines[/-] raiders is a bit boring compared to other things you could be doing, and you get sort of stuck out in space--it's not worth spending an entire turn coming back to the ship to do something else. Also, since everything in space disappears whenever you jump and pilots get shunted back into the hangar, it can often feel, as a pilot, like you were just about to blow up some serious Cylon butt when you get teleported back into the ship. And again. And again. So being a pilot's a bit thankless. But overall the flaws are few, and the game is addictive and really well-done. My rating's currently a 9 for it--tied with SoC--but I can see that increasing as I see if I feel the same after more plays.

When I tell people I found this game worse than staring at a dead cat, they allways say
1) Oh in some sessions it can happen that the game is way too esay but most of the times it's a fun experience.
2) Oh but the expensions fix that.
When I ask people to invest hours in listening to me explaining rules and in playing a game where almost nothing happens except 5 people throwing cards on a pile to see we passed the 30th "skillcheck", I cannot tell them "next time maybe we will have fun and traitors and cool enemies on the board."

Once I put aside negative perceptions and actually watched the show and played the game, I was absolutely thrilled with this multi-player effort.

Superb co-op/traitor game. Forget the theme, this game could have been set as a wagon train with Native Americans trying to stop it reaching Oregon,

RATING: 9
Does a magnificent job of creating tension and paranoia among all the players. 

By the time you enter into the second phase of the game, you'll hardly trust anyone. Every nuance that is out of character and every suspect decision that you may be forced into making, targets you as a Cylon.

After all there is no real way of telling until they reveal themselves by which time it may well be too late.

As players get more experienced with this game, I can envisage the pressure cranking up unbearably. 

I wager that someone will totally lose it, during a game of BSG at some stage in the future. I just hope that it's not me.

Two plays, and I'm getting into it. I've never seen the TV series, but it doesn't seem that important. More of an exercise in group manipulation than other co-op games I've played: there doesn't seem that much chance of an individual dominating proceedings. The traitor element works far better than in Shadows over Camelot.

Fun game. Although we didn't get to finish, I enjoyed what we played.

I was Baltar and was a Human (and made tons of mental strategies to expose the Cylon) until we started the first turn and I realized I was suppost to get another Loyalty card. It turns out that other card made me a Cylon, so I had to re-think everything.

I played very conservatively, only messing up a few skill challenges that would have given other people a chance to look at my Loyalty cards. Because I was the President, I used this as an excuse to leave the main ship and draw tons of Quorum cards. We had 2 Pilots and the Support repairer in the game, so I knew destroying BSG would be too difficult.

My plan was to find out who the other Cylon was and join forces with them secretly to destroy the Morale of BSG, unfortuantly I got the other Cylon card at the half mark... which we then called game because it was getting late.

Best "co-operative" game I've played so far, beating out Pandemic, Last Night, and Shadows Over Camelot by a lot.

Hopefully I will get a chance to play again (and as a Cylon again... I love being evil)!

UPDATE: Played again and I was Baltar and a Cylon again. We (the Cylons) managed to win and lose. We won because the players messed up their turn order, but then when we went back and replayed it in the correct turn order we lost by a single action. Very close and very tense!

I'm quickly becoming an absolute fanboy of this game.  There is always something interesting to be doing in every person's turn, and your decisions usually involve very difficult trade-offs.  I look forward to playing this one day where I'm not teaching a new player.

Official solitaire variant is too easy, 2-player was not good the one time we tried.

4- and 6-player games seem truly unbalanced.  If the humans are all in the blue at the halfway-point, cylons seem undefeatable.  And I hate the prospect of intentionally getting one resource in the red to counteract this.

INTRIGUE!  Incredible game, will keep an open-minded group entertained for hours.  The "voting" system really makes things tense, and it's great fun to be humans and cylons.  It's a little unbalanced toward the cylons, and the "sympathizer" cards can be pretty lame, nobody wants to be a revealed cylon, but that's fixable by house rules.

Let me start with saying that I am not a BSG TV show fan.  I never saw the new version, but did watch the original as a kid.  That being said, I have enjoyed this game for what it is...a semi-coop with a hidden traitor role.

However, it is getting pretty played out by now.  I will still play it, but I don't gravitate towards it when I am scanning my shelves.

RATING: 10
Solid coop game with traitors. One of the very few games that can seat seven players and still have very little downtime - you're always watching the others, guessing who is a cylon and who is just a bad player.  

Play it with friends, this game is best when the group is loud and friendly.

BSG is one of the best games ever when it works.  Unfortunately it doesn't work a lot of the time and you get boring games with long periods of nothing happening.  I'd say the biggest knock against BSG is that it's inconsistent.  It's like buying a car that runs like a champ 1 out of every 3 times you turn it on.  You can only turn it on so many times before you get tired of wondering what you'll get.

A very thematic game that seems a bit unbalanced in our group. In 4 games, we have a 100% win rate for Cylons and we don't really see the need for Cylons to hide to win the game. Why not reveal early and play cards for the rest of the game, apart from the fact that it's not fun?

The humans should have won 1 of those game, possibly 2 of those games, but made one big mistake. The other games, the Cylons played well, but it seems you need to play perfectly as human to win, which is okay, but you need to know before you play.

Otherwise, I really enjoy the atmosphere and the length isn't a huge problem for me.

Not broken, but not for me.  This is like werewolf were you try to figure out who's on your team and you randomly vote people into the brig.

Unfortunately the game just drags on too long for what it is.  2009/04/06

Seems like an incredibly well thought out game in terms of keeping with the theme/plot/feel of the show. First game seemed way too long (5 hrs) so keen to try again with better understanding of the rules/tactics, and with a timer in place for the crisis events.

The real clincher is the Cylon/traitor aspect, which is made even stronger by the possibility of being 'switched on' at the halfway point. This puts it above a game like Pandemic, because even if it turns out that there aren't any Cylons in your midst, the possibility that you might be competing against a real person and not just 'the board' makes it much more fun. Also, it creates a level of compulsory secrecy which means that you actually get to make real decisions on your turn, rather than ending up following one bossy player who knows how to beat the game.

Brilliant game. Though the theme will offset some non-gamers, it is actually as good as The Resistance (which came later and was probably inspired by this game).

But where The Resistance is just a 'clean design' that takes only the core mechanic of 'cooperative traitor', BS incorporates a very thematic 'Arkham Horror'-esque theme with that.

Only reason that the rating for this game is not the solid '9' I give to The Resistance is the fact that piloting seems quite underpowered and almost worthless, due to the fact that jumping is a MUCH better way to get rid of every troublesome fleet around you.

However, maybe we played it wrong. Time will tell as this will definitely get a replay.

We had four players, and not quite enough time to finish the game, so I might have to bump up the ranking after a few more plays.

With four players, the game was alright, and the crises had a good rhythm to them. However, in my particular play group the Cylon didn't do anything especially obvious. He was admiral and getting us to the destination slowly with maximum fuel losses, which was fantastic Cylon behavior ... it just meant that no one ever got very suspicious which is what makes the game so interesting.

The next play had the full compliment of five players and went much better. Things were hectic enough before the sleeper phase that we were nervous and scrambling for control even though we all happened to be human. Once the sleeper phase hit, three Cylons emerged (Boomer and Baltar were in play), two of them not in the least subtle--the president and the admiral. One of them revealed near the end of the game passing the presidency to the unrevealed (but painfully obvious) Cylon admiral. It was rather beautiful. I had a wonderful little plan for how to salt the wound a little more before outing myself as a Cylon as well leaving the three two humans to contend with a mad robotic Military President. Unfortunately we had to cut the game short.

I love the rhythm of the game, and I suspect it gets even more interesting when someone starts the game as a Cylon. I think the crisis deck is mostly good, but it doesn't quite keep the pressure up when the fleet isn't around. Our poor pilots turn useless every time we jump and the pressure rockets right down. There are awkward stretches where nothing happens in space and the crises aren't quite up to creating tension all by themselves.

All in all, a great game. Looking forward to more. I think this is also the first Fantasy Flight game I've played that stays within the time limit printed on the box. ;)

Great game only it can get a bit long in the tooth when you find yourself waiting it out for the base star to arrive.  It is a brilliant game for 'who's the cylon' tension, but the hang up lies in not having a good flow for battle.  It could be fixed by maybe having more cards with a base star or more frequent 'attack' cards? who knows.  Best bit though is trying to figure out the cylon...lots of action man eye movement sussing each other out.

I really enjoyed my first couple of times playing this game, but it has its flaws. The political card that makes everybody play with open cards is just broken, and removes everything that is exiting with the game (Cylons sabotaging skill checks). It feels like cylons can not do that much damage, and even if we find cylons before they can do any damage humans might still loose, because it is besically humans vs game (random events determines almost everything)

This is probably not always the case, but somehow, all 3 times I played this game, that's how it ended up.  And I didn't care for most of the expansions either -- seemed to needlessly add footprint and complexity without adding a whole lot to gameplay.

I can't believe how different things get every time you play. Some games the Cylons attack in droves and the pilots are scrambling to keep up, other times space is quiet and the Humans are at each other's throat (and there may not even be a Cylon in play).

The only bad things I can say about the game is that the game lasts a little longer than it should and with the imbalance at four and six players, it's in the Human's best interests to do poorly in the first half so that they keep the advantage in numbers. The first expansion fixes this and a couple of other inconsistencies.

I still want to love this game, but can't help but feel that The Resistance does all the good things this does and plays in a fraction of the time. 

I guess it has a more epic feel than The Resistance, but I have much less desire to play this now than I used to...

Update: the game is, sadly, solvable for the humans which breaks it. It's also so hugely padded out, with 20 minutes of gameplay in three hours of sitting at the table. That's entirely unforgivable. Yes, I've had some epic, memorable plays of this, but it has also delivered some of my least favourite gaming memories.

Rating down from 6 (from a high 7 originally) to 3.

Update 4/26/10: Played twice via PBF (6p and 5p).  Definitely a fun game.  It's important to have the right crowd, as a lot of the tension comes from the players actions/dialogue.

A nice "hidden traitor" game, which benefits from more than 3 participating players.
Also, the players should make sure that they understand all the traitor cards and their special rules.
Also, especially with new players, it might be a good idea to rule that everybody looking at a card should act like he has to read some text - even if there isn't much. Otherwise, Cylon players are in danger to give themselves away to easily.

So far this one is my favorite of the "traitor" games.  It does the best job of attempting to allow the traitor to affect the game without giving themselves away (although there is still room for improvement).  It DOES take a bit longer than the other games of this nature but it is well worth it in my opinion.  Glad I picked this one up.

After more plays:  Still enjoy the game but think the sweet spot is 5 players.  I have played a couple of 7 player games and it was just a bit too long between turns for my taste.

Downgraded from 8 to 7 on 5/11/10

This game is very dependent on the group you play it with.  Perhaps it's just my usual gaming group, but I've had a couple of undiscovered and discovered Cylons play as friendly as possible, which throws off the balance of the game.  The core mechanics are great, though, and it really does capture the progression of the show (paranoia turning into survival turning into making really tough decisions...).

Just... not... feeling it.  You're tripping along playing your ass off as a human and barely holding your own and then wham, you're a skin job and you're winning flat-out.  In both cases my contributions feel meagre.  I've only played 4-P games, maybe the dynamic of "Is she or isn't she?" is tighter and more compelling in 5-P+...

Thoroughly enjoy this game.  I can certainly understand the complaints... it is more of an experience than a board game in the traditional sense, but I've played with a few game-noobs and they picked it up quickly.  The cylon mechanic IS the game, but with the right group (AT fans a boon) the accusations fly and paranoia abounds.  Good stuff.  So say we all.

This game is awesome, there sure are a lot of expansions, and different options, actually there are so many that they should consider creating a new version,  where they fix the few issues this game has. at it's base game it's good (7- or 8) with some of the expansions it's closer to 9 and 10, Highly recommend this game.

Battlestar Galactica has strong theme and great artwork, I love the show, and it matches the show perfectly both from a theme and gameplay standpoint.  However, the game suffers from a few obnoxious problems.  

The first is that the game can draw out for an extremely long time, what is worse is that you can frequently feel like you are doing very little each turn, and in some cases, you can even be put into the brig where you essentially can't do anything.

I have also felt like the Cylons typically lose, and when a player reveals themselves as a Cylon there doesn't seem to be much they can participate in or do except for one big power when it becomes their turn, so the game becomes even more boring for them.

All in all, I absolutely love the idea, theme, art, and gameplay.  Described in person it sounds incredible, but when you actually play it it is a bit painful and by hour 3 you will be looking at the clock wanting it to end.  

I will not refuse to play this game, but I definitely have to be in the right mindset.

Primer contacto con el juego. Varias consultas al reglamento, explicación a los jugadores con todo lo que conlleva. Partida larga, en la que no estoy seguro de haber jugado bien todas las reglas, estoy seguro que una segunda partida sera mucho más dinámica y placentera.

Es un juego con potencial, pero para empezar a exprimirlo, me temo que hay que jugarlo unas 3 partidas con el mismo grupo para sacarle el jugo y disfrutarlo en condiciones.

La segunda partida fue mucho más fluida, disfrutable y divertida. A pesar de ello metimos la zarpa en algunos detalles que convirtieron el juego en algo imposible para los humanos.... a la tercera ira la vencida! :D

This is a really, really good game.

The semi-collaborative set-up - where you appear to be working together, but some may be covertly or overtly working against you - brings in a great social element. As a fan of the show, it sure is fun to hop in a Viper and start zapping Cylon. Plus nothing beats that thrill of revealing as a Cylon at just the worst possible time!

BSG is divisive. My SO normally loves game and even liked the show, but she hates the game and refuses to play. Also, players with greatly disparate levels of expertise can wreck the game (like if the only new players or the only one who's played it before ends up as the sole Cylon).

Игра вообще для компании замечательная. Больше похожа на Банг чем на Камелот. Простые правила, но довольно сложная стратегия достижения цели.

The face down cards plays plus the destiny deck make the game. It makes it easier to mess with the outcomes while pretending to be on everyone's side compared to a game like Shadows over Camelot. In Shadows it seems that mostly the way to play in secret as the traitor is to be a dead weight for the rest of the team. As soon as you tip your hand you can draw an accusation that comes out of turn.

In Battlestar you can poison the pot with bad cards and blame other people. You can tip your hand but not actually declare that you are Cylon and not have to give up the advantages of playing as a human. Other players have to take actions on their turn to stop you from being a threat and there's a turn order that you can exploit while doing so. So, it certainly makes it easier to play the traitor. But, it seemed that our game had a few easy jumps and the humans still lost, so I'm curious how easy it will be to win as the humans. Only time will tell.

Frak.  I've played this half a dozen or so times now, including some great games at BGG.con last year, and perhaps more this year.  The only problem?  [i]I've never been a Cylon[/i].  Yet.

A tense game that works best, IMO, with 5, but 6 can sometimes function, even if I'm not a big fan of the Sympathizer.  Lots of options, lots of cards.  Players, however, need to push people to take their turns.  This game can really drag if people aren't paying attention and aren't planning a little bit ahead, and then it becomes boring.

RATING: 7
After getting in a good number of plays, I ranked it down from an 8.

I still like playing it, but have recently run across a few flaws in the meta-gaming the sympathizer, a president Cylon that couldn't create intrigue because all the crisis cards were needing of his colors, and finally a game in which nearly played itself out for a Cylon win, with little help from the hidden Cylons.

Just beware there are a few possibilities that fate may just have you in for a bad session.

Played this many times, though it relies heavily on the quality of your fellow players.  As the game is so bluff heavy the interest is in people's ability to screw you over and a lot of the game is lost when playing with new players.

Also ambush cards make things feel a little too random at times, and result in long spells with little pressure, or interest.

L'ambiance autour de la table est très intéressante: on soupçonne toujours quelqu'un d'être Cylon. Le thème est aussi bien rendu. Mais les décisions sont plutôt simple à son tour de jeu et la durée est trop longue.

Edit: tour de jeu répétitif et durée trop longue. Vraiment pas pour moi.

This is a somewhat complex and yet engaging cooperative game with a traitor element.  Even though I am not familiar with the backstory at all, this game is still quite engaging and fun.  The Cylon traitor mechanic is well done, and it tends to spread discontent and suspicion through the ranks whether or not there is actually a Cylon.  That makes for some pretty memorable games.

RATING: 10
My first and original love affair with board games. Since I found I prefer euro games over thematic ones, but the theme on this one (BSG is one of my top 3 shows ever) give it a big plus. 

The base game alone is pretty much perfect, but I can't play it any more, due to the fact that there are 10 skill cards in the whole game, and I'm used to so much more.

The trick is: add the least amount possible from the expansions to get a great game.

Note: I have about 25+ more games of this I've played with this before boardgaming overtook my life, hence they are unlogged. I also have about 10 more games of this played on VASSAL. So really my playcount is in the forties, not the single digits.

Ebay.

Internal Dialogue for every game:

Before role assignment: "I want to be the cylon."
After role assignment: "I think everyone is a cylon but me...I hate cylons"
Remember there are more role assignments: "Maybe the cylon card is still out there after all, I want to be the cylon."
After 2nd role assignment: "I hate cylons."

There are a lot of games based on TV shows and Movies. Some are good games, some are neat because they remind you of the show. However BSG is a great game that actually captures the feeling of the series.

The mystery of who, if anyone, is sabotaging missions. The constant barrage of enemies attacking. Do we have the fuel to make it? Do we have the food/morale/population to make it? When do I make my move as the cylon?

Awesome.

I wish I could get it to the table more.

I don't watch the show and I'm not a big fan of traitor mechanics (I greatly dislike werewolf), so the appeal of the game is wasted on me.

The first two games were really good, tension was high regarding both the anonymous cylon and whether or not the Galactica was going to reach Kobol. Really nice, one of the very best co-op -games with Space Alert and Pandemic. 

UPDATE: I'm having sooo much fun while playing this that I'm considering updating the rating to "10".

UPDATE: Ok, it's a 10. Played with 6 players and the game played just as good. We, people, we're so near to win but the cylons took it. The loss came with a bad dice roll but it tells a lot about the quality of the game when bad dice rolls don't bother me that much. This game is about the experience and interaction with other players, not so much about winning or losing. One of the very best games I've played.

UPDATE: Played it with Exodus expansion. Can't say I was completely taken by the new features. Cylon fleet adds a decent amount of tension to the proceedings but also takes away from leisure time which have been used to accuse others and play powerplay.Not bad by any means but I think Pegasus might be enough for me.

I will normally agree to play this, even if it can go a bit long. Most of my games have had great moments in them, but the end game can drag more than I like, after the bluffing element is over. Also I find that with all the expansions it is hard to see all the stuff on the board - there is a lot of small print.

This is lots of fun. Play it in PBF, PBEM, live, ... I love the show, I love the roleplay aspect, love the deduction and the search for the Hidden Traitor(s). The game itself is somewhat flimsy, but it is adequate for what it is trying to do (give you the framework for the roleplaying & deduction).

A social experiment every game. Dont play with sympathizer cards... This game is better than the sum of its parts. The game itself is throw in cards here and there with simple actions inbetween.

It was great fun but I'm not quite sure whether the game was decided by skill, luck or randomness.

I've really enjoyed this in the early going. Along with Pandemic and Ghost Stories, this seems to be part of a new generation of cooperative games that just blows the earlier ones (like Shadows Over Camelot and Lord of the Rings) away.

Maybe it takes too long time between turns, and maybe throwing cards is not all that fun in the long run. For the time being, however, this will see regular play. Paranoia is present. Sometimes it feels like playing a coöperation game with neither co nor operation.

Edit: With a full game under the belt, this game is a winner. It does take a long time to play, so I am pretty sure that four players is the prefered amount.

Edit: When everyone knows the rules and the down time is kept to a minimum, this shines.

It's tough to build a cooperative game that remains engaging for 2-3 hours, but Battlestar Galactica succeeds by inserting saboteurs:  who is a Cylon and how do you win despite their treason?  The conflicting missions generate tension and even glorious paranoia, and it's a winner.

I wish there were a way to have the potential cylon be a non-player, so that no players are cylons... but I understand why it's the way it is.

It has a great sci-fi setting, a foreboding atmosphere, well-differentiated characters that are true to the show, a cohesive narrative, and, refreshingly for an FFG game, it's a fairly simple design that's easy to learn and teach.

I've liked Konieczka's previous designs that I've played, but often with some reservations.  He absolutely nailed this one out of the park.  An instant favourite.

The expansions, unfortunately over-complicate the game, so I now feel less comfortable taking it off the shelf.

Thematically this is a monster of a game. What a perfect way of integrating the TV-shows story into gameplay mechanics. Epic by any means, the vanguard of the Adding uncertainty-mechanic.

Hands down the best traitor game--beating Shadows Over Camelot (which it takes several aspects from) by no small margin.  The only thing that SoC has over BSG is the playing time.  However, and this is a huge however, the experience is head and shoulders better with BSG.  It can run a bit long, but this will mainly be due to a tremendous amount of interaction--a ton of game above the board.  This sacrifice is small when you factor in what you are doing in the game, and what playing it entails.  A rich experience all around, and one that places most of the emphasis on human (player) aspects and not on mechanical aspects.

One of the best games out there for letting a pack of friends stop being friends for a couple hours. It doesn't hold up perfectly after a bunch of repeat plays, since everyone will learn the effects of all the cards, but it's magic while it lasts.

Great Hidden Traitor/Coop game themed around the TV show

RATING: 7.5
Runs long and a bit of a learning curve for new players (especially ones who haven't seen the show.)  But once it gets rolling, it's a great way to spend an evening.  Playing this against a gifted Cylon is gripping.  As is trying to be a gifted Cylon.  
I've seen a few games in which one side or the other seemed to be screwed from early on, but I think that was more the players than the game.
Incidentally, I started watching the show because I liked the game.  And now I have a dog named after one of the BSG characters.

For me, this is a great 2-hour game that takes 3 or 4 hours to play. When it's good, it's really good, but sometimes, especially when all the cylons have revealed, it just drags. And I really don't like the sympathizer mechanic. I'm tempted to get the expansions just to resolve this.

But with 5 people who are into it, there's nothing like it.

I have played this game too much. I had really good games, tense, won in the last second, but after some time it has lost a bit the touch and I don't really feel like playing it most of the time... 
In any case, I love the mechanic of the hidden affiliation to either humans or cylons, and what I dislike the most is being a cylon, because the game becomes (in my opinion) boring and limited.

Battlestar Galactica is too long for what it is and it has a number of frustrating points (one action a turn that normally feels inconsequential, possibility for a very long time between Cylons attacking).

The theme and the mechanics of the main social deduction aspect are wonderful though, so we just play a shorter game variant with lower starting resources and a shorter win distance and the game is great fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Holy crap, I cannot say enough about this game.  First off, let's just get it out of the way... this is a long game.  You WILL be playing this for 3 hours, maybe even 4 if there's a lot of analysis paralysis at the table, or maybe only 2 hours if the humans are epicly terrible.  But I digress... This is one of my favorite games simply because of the player interaction.  Also, the theme is awesome and this game is pretty spot on with the show, and the expansions seem to only add cool (though likely unnecessary) stuff to the game.  I've only ever played 5-6 players, and it's always been awesome.

Heavy with theme and great execution of a media tie-in.  Proudly on the shelf to display the SciFi logo (unlike the Pegasus box which resides empty and hidden due to the SyFy logo).

However, I find that the more time I play it, the less I enjoy it.  This makes me sad but I remain hopeful that after some time away it will be refreshed.

RATING: 7
Playing as a cylon is wickedly fun. Playing as a human is an exercise in noble desperation. This game is entirely one-sided. The cylons should win every time. Each time I played as a human, I felt i didn't stand a chance. As a cylon, I couldn't have lost if I tried.

RATING: 9
This game is awesome.  If you love semi-cooperative games that have a traitor in them (like mafia), then this is your cup of tea.  The only negative is that new players will get intimidated by rules and it's a 2-3 hour game.  However, it's the most fun game I have.  Most of my friends love this game.

I don't get why people like this game so much.  I feel like for most the game I'm not doing anything.  Finally it's my turn.  I draw two cards and I'm done.  I like the pass/fail mechanic and there are things that are interesting, but for the most part I just feel like everyone knows what to do all the time and the game doesn't "start" until the second round.

Way too long, and way too little agency on the game. So hard too. After hour 5, I started to get really angry with my girlfriend for holding the game up. It's not like you're having to do things that were very different each round. Draw cards, sort out the most urgent issue, resolve a crisis. After 7 hours, the fun had very much worn off.

I'll play if people want to, but I won't be rushing out to buy it, or asking for it if I see it on a shelf.

First Impression:

A very immersive game that trully delivers the experience. A most enjoyfull journey, at least initially. 
A good narrator significantly adds to the experience.

I seems to drag too long though. There are surprisingly few things to do each round, and the best option is usually obvious. You get to play your turn 2-3 times per hour, and despite the player interaction and the casual votings, that makes for a poor performance for what is essentially a deduction game with a great theme.

In short, bsg is a game of player interaction, deduction style, where the story of bs galactica unfolds, similar to what happened in the series. However, it clearly misses the sweetspot.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Every game is its own story, and while the mechanics of the game make it bog down sometimes the subtle backstabbing and general lack of trust is constantly entertaining.  I'm interested to try the "express" version of this that has garnered some interest lately, as a shorter game that keeps the same feel would be amazing.

RATING: 9
This is my favorite board game of all time. It's the granddaddy of epic semi-cooperative board games. Some of my greatest experiences in gaming have been from this game. The only reasons I give it 9 instead of 10 are the length, the rules complexity, and the awkwardness of getting the "communication rules" right.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It seems like a souped up better version of bang.  Trying to hide your desire to be destructive to the good team, without trying so hard you give it away.  This doesn't match my gaming tastes in the least, but this game doesn't transcend styles.  If this is your type of game, you will enjoy it, but if it is not.... well skip it.  The theme also does absolutely nothing for me as well.  Really, this game never really had a chance for me as all of its strengths are wasted on me.  Sometimes you just gotta play the other guys games.

There is probably 1 hour of decisions stretched out over the playing time.  Distilling the accusing and suspicion over 1 hour would be an amazing game design feat, I hope somebody accomplishes, but this design does not.

This rating assumes me being the admiral or president.  If one of those two roles are occupied by another player, this is probably a point lower.

UPDATE: My rating of this game has slowly climbed from 5, to 6, to 7, and just now to 8.  I like it more with each play.  I also like it a lot more now that I've started watching the television show, so I understand the theme and characters.  This actually prompted me to start a thread and poll on this topic: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/400654.  The paranoia and suspicion in this game is really excellent.  The game is still too long, but it's always memorable and enjoyable.  I'm looking forward to the expansion later this year. ----- Original Comment: I liked the paranoia that this game inspired in everyone with accusations flying about who was a traitor and people being jailed for acting too suspicious.  However, the game overstayed its welcome for me, lasting a few hours.  I also know nothing about the story and have never seen the show, so the characters and setting don't interest me.  Lastly, you really need a poker face to be able to play this, so if you're like me and everyone instantly knows whether you're a werewolf or a villager, then this game may not be for you.

This game has some amazing mechanics that throw the room into a thrall of paranoia. What you are doing is very simple and would be boring if everyone wasn't at each others throats.

On that note, BSG is repetitive and tends to play longer than I have patience for most of the time (unless the cylons win before the final part of the game). It gets to the point where I don't really care who wins near the end because I just want the monotony to be over. It's not that the actual time is too long for the game to run, but it just gets incredibly repetitive after an hour or so.

A running theme for me is that I like coop games with hidden traitors. I prefer the base game, without any expansions thrown in, to keep it simple. Though I'm definitely up for throwing in SOME expansion content as well, should people feel the need to do so.

Very thematic to the show.

RATING: 9
Honestly, this game is a huge blast to play...  It captures the theme of the show very well, and the characters are all faithful representations of their TV counter-parts.

The whole "are they a cylon?" mechanic is actually fun as opposed to annoying, and the rules are pretty quick to pickup and understand.

Great stuff.

RATING: 7.5
I like this game much more in my first dozen games.

Now, I don't know. I had one particularly bad game (however I know the responsible for this isn't the game, but one of the players), and some that, after the second jump I could see if the humans or the cylons have a fighting chance to win or if the game is already decided one way or another. Which isn't the coolest thing.

So, the rating that was a 8.5, dropped to 7.5.

****

Edit: I will still maintain the 7.5 rating, but after playing more times without expansions, a say this:

The base game is a 8.

The game with expansions: 7, or lower.

*****

Anyway, BSG was responsible for some amazing moments that got talked about to this day. Recently, it entered in a sort of "freeze" zone, as there are so much new stuff, and we played BSG sooooo much, that we mostly have a feel that we already gave the game its fair share. Still, when we have exactly 5 people to play, we are always thinking that we could be playing BSG. After 2010 I played [thing=41114][/thing] and [thing=128882][/thing], and both fell terrible flat with me. More than flat, actually, as I actively despise them. I still got the chills when I see someone saying the Resistance games take everything good of BSG and put it in a 30 minute game. No, they didn't. They lack the depth, the struggle, the stakes, the true feel of hopelessness and achievement either side can have.

Got as a gift. As expected, very poorly written, unindexed rulebook and very cluttered game. Lot's of things that could be done better, excessive use of cards (designer solution to problem that does not really exist). Figures are useless in the game, but also rubbish quality. Eons of downtime between player turns. Frequent deck reshuffling and incredibly repetitive game turns. 

Game is way too long for what it is (4h+ (Note: this is a timescale one can play Hannibal, ASL, Wilderness War, Successors and many other very rewarding games to conclusion and even have some spare time left)).

This game needs complete rule rewriting - or lacking that, comprehensive incorporated errata.
--
Too many games where resources run dry before anyone can do anything about it even without Cylon help (eg. discard X cards to prevent resource Y loss and player could not even theoretically have the necessary cards available). Happened way too many times now. Meh.

It's best played with a group that already knows the game, and once you have that you have an intense experience with tough challenges, serious doubt, and tons of fun. Not for everyone, but awesome with the right group.

At first it seemed really biased toward the Cylons, but after dozens of plays it's closer to even with a slight leaning toward the Cylons. A fun fun challenge!

Unfortunately, there are certainly downsides. There can be significant downtime, especially with Allies from Exodus involved. There is no small amount of luck. It seems the humans have a very difficult time winning if two Cylons happen to be dealt from the start, and that's a purely random event. These keep it from going higher than an 8/10 for me.

Only played once. I really liked it. Gamemechanics and theme works great together. BSG theme is the best one that I could dream of (well, maybe Babylon 5 or Farscape would be awesome as vell). 

Forget about Shadows over Camelot.

RATING: 8
The central theme Battlestar Galactica of the Cylon players attempting to remain hidden to disrupt the humans efforts to stay alive and uncover the traitors makes the style of play a refreshing change from the resource management type of game.  Post game discussions are fascinating to find out from which point the cylon players were actually Cylons.  Were they Cylon from the begining or only half way through.  I've seen games where one cylon throws the other in the brig because he thought that player was a human.

To be honest, only rates this high with the expansions. The Cylon pursuit track is required, in my book.

RATING: 6
Played this in between games at a board game tournament and had a decent time doing it. I played as the bad guy in a five person game and was able to keep myself hidden until I thought it was best to reveal myself. The play is fairly brisk and the flow decent, but the game was beginning to feel long when me and my newly formed baddie was able to take down the good guys. Even not being a watcher of the show, I enjoyed it for a co-op sort of affair, but I can't see this being something I'd play one a week to week, or even month to month basis.

I really love this game, the traitor mechanic is great. I haven't played as cylon yet, but I desperately want to! I know how I would play as the cylon but none of the cylons I've played with have done anything like it so I can't wait to give it a shot.

I have the following expansions for this one:
Pegasus

11/14/10, Increasing rating after a 3rd play. I really enjoy this one. 

Based on 1 4 player game. Sympathizer went to cylon side. 

I found the early game with unrevealed cylons to be very fun and exciting.

The cylon player revealed shortly after the sympathizer came out and the second half of the game quickly became two humans versus 2 cylon players. I thought this second part of the game dragged a bit. I was human, but it seemed like being a revealed cylon was a pretty boring role.

BSG gets a special mention for outstanding integration of theme into mechanics. Almost all elements of theme get worked seamlessly into gameplay to create an immersive game experience. 

Finally, while long for a Euro, this is short for a FFG. Our game, with 1 new player, came in at 3 hours.

RATING: 5
It's a co-operative game which is a type I'm not particullary fond of.  It's also based on the new series instead of the classic which I like but haven't watched the new one.
While not as bad as other co-op games in that everyone is telling you what to do for the good of the team, it still has that element.

Played a lot of this since it first came out, interesting team effort. The twist is that you don't know which players turn out to be Cylons.  Full of theme, especially after watching the entire series. The game is all about convincing other players who the Cylons are. Humans have to work really hard for the win because the Cylons have the definite advantage, especially after several players turn traitor!

Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game is an exciting game of mistrust, intrigue, and the struggle for survival. Based on the epic and widely-acclaimed Sci Fi Channel series, Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game puts players in the role of one of ten of their favorite characters from the show. Each playable character has their own abilities and weaknesses, and must all work together in order for humanity to have any hope of survival. However, one or more players in every game secretly side with the Cylons. Players must attempt to expose the traitor while fuel shortages, food contaminations, and political unrest threatens to tear the fleet apart.

Simply epic with the right company.

Update April 2014: After about 6-7 more plays, each and every one undecided to the very last few turns, EPIC moments/paranoia (the brig gets used a lot after the sleeper phase),... This is just my favorite game, adding in the expansions soon for (even) more mayhem.

Update 2015: Still one of the greatest. Must say, with owning all the expansions, the most balanced version of the game is still the base game in itself. The expansions add some good things, and alternative endings, but the most balanced, tense gameplay tends to come from the base game alone.

This and Saboteur have my absolute favorite blend of hidden roles and game play. For someone who likes games like Werewolf/Mafia but who has a terrible poker face, being able to cloak your deception with concrete game play makes this a wonderful game. Perhaps a bit long, but I love how everything comes together.

Update: Almost entirely supplanted by Dark Moon, which does everything BSG does in a fraction of the time.

I love games with traitor mechanic. Battlestar galactica is pretty complicated game, but it also gives players many options. Both to humans, and cylons. Base game alone is pretty good, but once you start playing with expansions, you will never return to the base game. They just add so much good stuff, especially exodus, which i recommend to get first. Game for the most part is not on the board. Is mostly in our minds. Bluffing and observing skills are crucial in this game.

This is a great example of a game that has transcended the simple genre categories of Ameritrash and Euro gaming.  The integration of theme is amazing, evoking the kind of panic and paranoia you see in the show beautifully, but the design is clean and streamlined, offering meaningful decisions every turn.  You will need a group that can handle the intensity of traitor mechanic, but if you have that kind of group this is about as good as gaming gets.

Great game just dripping with theme. A very simple game maybe even simpler then Shadows over Camelot. It's the tense atmosphere the game creates that makes this game a solid 9/10. 

Just like the TV series that inspired the game paranoia runs rampant as everyone suspects everyone else of being a Cylon. It's a hard game to beat and the challenge keeps me returning.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.3
A truly different ameritrash. Seems to favor one side (Cylons) at first but as the players learn the game balances out. What makes it different is the team mechanics and there is even a great tweak of a possibility of switching from one team to the other during the game. Downside is the usual ameritrash randomness for example allowing almost certain winning combinations for cylons through lot. Those into new Galactica keep telling me that it is oozing with theme (I liked the personal goals that were introduced in some extension) but haven't bothered with the series so can't really tell. Still for anyone looking for a nice dramatic ameritrash that does something different (or for anyone looking a Galactica themed game) this could be an excellent pick.

RATING: 6.25
Super long, fiddly, and I've never seen the show - so why's it so good?  Every turn is full of suspense, and sussing out who the Cylon is throws an extra wrinkle into an already difficult game.

EDIT 11/17 - downgraded after playing again.  Cylon Sympathizer is a terribly unfun role, plus the game seems to rely on luck to an unfortunate degree for a 3+ hour game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I really like how there's always something to do (or at least feels like it)... it's similar to Shadows, but a bit heavier and not so much of the frustration of not getting the cards one needs.

As for the sympathizer, it does feel awkward-- but I feel the main meat of the game is not so much the gameplay, but the fact that it really, really captures the tension of "who's who"-- and in that case, I feel the sympathizer can play the balancer role at a decent clip if everyone is revealed.

Sci fi themed boardgame.

Great game, especially with larger groups of players.  It's relatively quick to learn and has a lot of variety, and requires a lot of tough decisions.  The game also easily adapts to a co-op version (playable with any number of players upto six) with automated cylons.

Many of our games feel very close and victory is often not certain untill the very end.

One of the most requested games in my collection.

Not only does it capture the feel of the TV series spectacularly, it is one of the most fun, frustrating, nail-biting, anger rising games my group plays.

If you are into team, bluffing, back-stabbing games, this is one to get.

It is a true team game, but for much of the time, you are never really sure which players are on which team.

A great co-op/head-to-head game with a random element of which side you're on.  The expansions add characters and more boards for a more balanced game.  Requires teamwork and some group think because you will be relying on other players ... unless they're a cylon.  If possible, sleeve the skill cards due to a lot of shuffling and handling to prevent wear.

My first play of this with my dad and brother was a total disaster.  It is a family joke now.  The problem was that no cylons spawned after our first jump.......so it was just stupid.....humans won so easily it was horrible.  

I did think the game was going to be a lot better than it is.  But I could see the potential, depth, and fun that this will offer with role-playing gamers.  Lesson learned-  don't play cooperative role-playing space themed games with my dad (hard core republican conservative) and my brother (can't imagine him imagining he was someone else fighting evil.)

I own this but don't recommend it, though some folks love it and praise it highly. Here's why I have problems with it: it takes forever (the game can last hours) and there's a lot to learn to start playing. There are two many shorter 'fixed' Werewolf-like games out there for me to play this long one. In this genre, I prefer One Night Ultimate Werewolf, Resistance/Avalon, Coup, or Are You the Traitor? to this game, and I don't feel trapped into a long boring game I don't want to quit out of respect of teammates.

One of my all time favorite games.  though many people ive talked to have expressed concerns as to if the game is "fun" because of the people they have tried to play with.

I love how much this game invokes the spirit and feel of the show.  The actions you take on your turn always feel a bit dull to me, it's usually just grabbing a card or rolling a die.  Everything in the game feels punishing.  I really enjoy the central mechanism of choosing to use cards for their actions or to succeed goals.  Love traitor mechanisms.  In the end though... I dunno, the game just drags a bit.  Player turns feel too long.  If you're not a Cylon, there's that co-op feel of just getting repeatedly slapped down.   Still enjoy it, but not as much as I wish I did.

Really just the length of the game, and the drag of waiting for your turn knock this down quite a bit.  I wish that turns could go quicker and not lose that epic feeling of the game.  As it is, I'm always hesitant to play.

1st update (Aug 2014)[7]: A parting comment, as I've sold the game. It was too clunky to really entice me, even though I'm a huge fan of the show. I prefer some of the social deduction games, as it boils down the most interesting part of the game - finding the cylons.

So far, this game takes everything I hoped Shadows Over Camelot would be, and ramps it up with an awesome theme. It is slightly longer than I would like, but only because it will hurt its chances of regular play.

Update: Seems more group dependent than I thought it would be. Playing with even one person who's not interested can sour the experience.

I feel like this game gets more credit than it's due. Every now and then the game is fun and intense, but other times it feels boring. I guess it depends on the group you're playing with, but it also seems like there's not really much to do in the game unless you're the president, the commander, or a cylon. I get why people like it, but it's not for me.

RATING: 7
This is really just a complicated version of werewolf. It's a fun game, but the added complexity doesn't add to the fun, it just makes things more convoluted. I think the Resistance takes the traitor game in a better direction; still plenty of hard facts to judge people by, but quicker and closer to the real fun of the game: the betrayal.

UPDATE: I'm found this less enjoyable the second time. The game is bland as a cooperative game, and the traitor element is only as good as the people playing the traitors.

Rating after one play: but why so bad?
The game offers some few good aspects: like discovering that you are a traitor midway in the game. That said, why do I rate it bad?

Because it takes really long, is not streamlined at all and very repetitive. Pretending to have so much action by all those cards: but wait... 2 different cards of every color. Some action spaces have nearly no use at all while others are tremendous important.

You may end up losing the game as novices without knowing where you did lose it. Maybe you've lost it 1-2 hours before you realise i and just have to play so long to just realise you could gibr up.
Main element of the game: jumoing. Jumoing gets you away from the cylon ships while gets you nearer vicrots. Influence to jumping: few.

I tell everyone that I do not like cooperative games, but with one major exception: Battlestar Galactica.  In this game, every player needs to think for themselves, and determine who has which motives.  The voting for outcomes (done on 85% of all event cards) is a really simple but great mechanic.  When the votes are tallied, you can see the colors of the cards that were thrown in as negative votes.  With deductive reasoning, you can often figure out who the cylons are from this information, and this is really the best part of the game.

RATING: 10
A coop game with traitors mechanics. It is one of the best game-theme combinations I have seen in games. Full of situations where you need to deal with a crisis while trying to find the traitors and deal them. One of the best for me in it's genre, can be quite stressful sometimes but a very rewarding experience.

RATING: 7
I wasn't impressed. The game was far to long for what it offered. There was too much downtime. The interesting mechanic: the cooperation and possible traitor, can be gotten in Shadows over Camelot with less hassle.

Edit: I've really come around regarding this game. If you have just one person who knows the rules down pat, then the game can move along pretty quickly. It provides a much deeper experience than Shadows and is more thematic. Giving a big ratings bump from 5 to 7.

This was my first Co-op game and I really have grown to enjoy it.  The theme has become more fun as I've watched the show a bit now after my first play.  What really makes the game is the people more than the mechanics  The playful banter around the table makes the time fly even when not much is happening on the board.

As time has gone by, I now prefer the Resistance as it's all the fun and I can play several games in half the time.

RATING: 9
Not a fan of the show, haven't seen a single episode, but this one game is probably my gaming groups favorite way to spend an afternoon.

The mechanics are simple, and it is repeptitive, but if you can get into the game and the hidden traitor roles, it is a blast. People who say it lasts too long are just not playing it right. Yes, that is an elitest statement that won't apply to everyone, but this is a game to be experienced - not played.

One of the top five games to come out in the last five years - no contest.

RATING: 7
One of the richest thematic experiences ever, though I am suffering severe burnout as I pass the 10 play mark.  I knew nothing about the series when I played this the first time, but was enamored of it anyway.  Now that I've  seen the show, I see that this game does an excellent job reflecting the paranoia of the first two seasons.

I did fear that this would be a rehash of [gameid=15062], but it manages to keep the accusation and double-talk while eliminating some of the problems.  It is easier to secretly sabotage in BSG without giving away who you are, a glaring weakness in Shadows after a few plays.  It does have one weakness, which is that the tenseness can sometimes drop too low if the Crisis deck spits out an odd mixture of cards.  The game is better when there's ships around the board to keep plenty of juicy decisions.  Play with the battle board from the [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/85905/battlestar-galactica-exodus-expansion]Exodus expansion[/url] for best results.

Ugh. There is no actual board game here, it's an excuse to yell "cylon" and "toaster" at each other. Remove the traitorous cylon element, and what's left? Nothing. Toss some cards into the centre of the table for 4 hours straight, not that it matters anyway, just wait until the ship jumps.

Contrast with Shadows over Camelot, which functions perfectly well as a game even when no traitor is present.

Il gioco prende parecchio se si è fan della serie: la meccanica per cui chi prima è umano nella seconda parte della partita può essere Cylon potrebbe stonare in un gioco se non che qui si sposa benissimo con il tema del film. quindi c'è sempre cautela all'inizio da parte di tutti a non fare troppo bene.
La alea è ridotta, certo le carte sono pescate casualmente (e si può considerare la variante di mettere 1 carta flotta cylon ogni 10 crisi se non si vogliono sorprese) ma in questo modo si assapora il timing delle puntate, alcune frenetiche altre molto politiche a parlare. e in ogni caso il gioco si basa su questo mazzo di eventi di crisi, lo dice il nome stesso ogni carta è un ostacolo da affrontare non ci sono carte buone quindi + che un difetto l'alea qui è parte del gioco per dare origine a partite sempre diverse. Non lo trovo ripetitivo causa anche il gruppo che cambia ogni volta.
La lunghezza è giusta per dare spazio a tutte le varie sfaccettature di venire fuori, consiglio di dare il ruolo di Presidente al giocatore + esperto in quanto le carte Quorum sono molto difficili da gestire per i neofiti.

Nagyon erős tematikus játék, ahol minden játékelemet tudatosan úgy alkottak meg, hogy erősítse a bizonytalanságot és a gyanakvást!

Fantasztikus játék, de csak komoly érdeklődőknek! Vigyázat... 3-4 óra is benne lehet, ha sok a trash-talk! :)

It shouldn't be fun. Every turn is like having an executive team meeting at work,with all the attendant stress and egos and alpha male posturing.
But it is fun.Maybe because i am a fan of the show. I think its genius that there are no good decisions to be made in the game,that every act every character makes screams 'Cylon!' to the rest of the group. The game really is an exercise in social interaction,and providing your group has the mental accuity to survive the paranoid backbiting and distrust inherent in the system(it is all a game,after all)then this is probably the best traitor-in-our-midst game out there,bar none.

BSG is not a perfect game, but it is the one with the most memorable stories in my collection.  Although it is a bit complex (with some fiddly rule lookup cases), it is the best semi-cooperative game I've played.

The theme fits the semi-cooperative game style perfectly. 
 Tension builds (especially in the last half of the game) as players try to identify the traitor(s) and manage dwindling resources.

На самом деле в нее можно играть и вдвоем. Одному не пробовал.

Тема имеет для меня большое значение, а Галактика мне многим понравилась. Но и помимо темы, механика тоже не подводит.

Может конечно не понравиться что идут постоянные голосования - почти каждый ход, но с другой стороны в отличии от Камелота, намного сильнее ощущается, что испытания проходятся совместно.

----

Я понемногу смотрю что лежит в дополнении Пегас и кажется понимаю в чем недостаток Галактики.

Игра без дополнения - это только отрезок до Кобола. Игра с дополнением - это только от встречи с Пегасом до спасения с Каприки. Нет способа сыграть так, чтобы встретить Пегаса в пути. Не говоря о том, чтобы пролететь всю дорогу до самой Земли, на которой Пегас и Каприка лишь возможная альтернатива.

Игра построена так, что люди все время теряют, теряют и теряют. Вопрос лишь в том, сумеют ли они растянуть ресурсы до конца пути. Если же сравнивать с фильмом, то например воду и тилиум можно было потерять почти полностью, а затем полностью их восполнить. В игре же тенденция только к потерям, лишь изредка можно найти какую-то мелочь.

Получается что с атмосфера фильма передана лишь примерно наполовину (хотя это тоже приличное достижение). Также есть ряд неточностей, например: Галактика может атаковать только базовые корабли, Шэрон играет как пилот вайпера, а не раптора, у Розлин не просто видения - она может выбирать чему не произойти.

Had two great games of Battlestar Galactica and Quartermaster General with Rod Chapman, Jim Falkus, Pete Heatherington, David Jack and Chris Taylor this afternoon.
Both played in a friendly fashion, and uncharacteristically, the Cylons engineered a elatively 'peaceful' victory due to prompt, and perhaps precipitate action by the Tin Men!
Implicated as one of these, even before the cards had been allocated, I smiled inwardly at the outcome of the 'cut' and depsite asking an unecessary mechanic question, avoided censure!

Biggest problem is you either feast or famine in this game. You are either a cylon (which is fun) or the president (fun) or admiral (some fun) or anyone else (not much fun). I've played a game where I sat on my ass for two hours and watched everyone play (because I had real no decisions to make) and I played one where I was the president and a cylon (tense through most of the game).

I love the hidden role aspect of the game - but honestly the other stuff (skill cards, ships being attacked) didn't appeal much to me. At times I was thinking that I could just play werewolf and it would be over faster (and I like werewolf).

Awesome game.  I love the theme and the TV show (the new one, obviously).  The fact that your literally "playing against the game itself" is a great idea.  It can become very bias when you add cylons, but just makes the other human players pull together and REALLY work as a team and not individual players.

RATING: 3
If the game were half as long it would be OK, but ironically I'm always having the best time when we interrupt the game to argue and accuse each other of being cylons. What this underscores is how intrinsically uninteresting the actual game play is. I know the game is trying to "ooze" the theme but I would prefer a more stripped down game mechanically that captures the same psychological elements. In the end the density of meaningful decisions in this game is WAY too low for my tastes. Most of my geek buddies that like it say the theme is a big part of the appeal. I guess that makes sense- as someone who isn't a fan of the show it does very little for me.

I like the art/photos from the TV series though I have never actually seen the show.  Components are solid and on par with other Fantasy Flight games. Co-op with a twist. And although I'm not a co-op fan in general, this game was still fun. I think it would be better if I was a fan of the series.

Very impressive!  Other than BaHotH and Werewolf, this is the first "traitor" game I've played, and I really enjoyed it.  The mechanisms mesh well, and even though they reminded me a bit of Arkham Horror (the Crisis cards were a lot like the Mythos cards), it wasn't a bad comparison, since I really enjoyed AH.  The cooperative aspect of a game still intrigues me, but having to play the role of a traitor was new, and very fun.  The time aspect is a bit of a turn-off, but I'm very interested in trying this game again.  I wonder if it's as much fun, or just frustrating, to play as a human.

Even though I can't imagine playing BSG with no expansions any longer (they just add so much content and interaction!), and the base game seems too easy now (it definitely wasn't at first though, but my group really mastered it, and we played a LOT).. it still is probably the best board game I ever encountered for a few simple reasons:
- Little to no downtime: even if it's other player's turn, people talk about strategies, use skills, participate in events etc., everyone's engaged pretty much all the time.
- Lots of interaction: you play as a group, but everyone has their own skills, special abilities and places where they shine. So everyone thinks not only about themselves, but also about how others can contribute.
- Traitor mechanic done right: you deal with a general Cylon threat, but also with a traitor among you. It's a gameplay AND narrative mechanic (people discussing character's actions, trying to find who's secretly trolling etc.)
- Every game is different. We've played probably more than 100 games, and almost all the time many hilarious things happened we never thought were possible.

The game takes a lot of time (sometimes even around 7 hours), but is completely worth it. It's both strategic and narrative, and engaging all the time.

One negative is perhaps that it's most appealing to people who watched the show. However the TV series are really good (even if we're not die hard fans), and we introduced the game to people who've never watched it, and they still enjoy the gameplay a lot (but I imagine it would be hard to get into the game if no one in your group has ever seen the series).

There is a lot to like here. Very tense game. My main complaint is that combat is fiddly. Moving plastic ships around and sticking damage tokens etc starts getting tiresome. Other than that, this is a pretty solid game.

played a 2 player with 2 characters each to get a feel for the game flow. Finally played with 4 and a possible cylon..The game fell apart. I was the cylon, but then in sympathizer phase, I got that card too and our resources were good, so I had to become a useless cylon that was outed.  Before that Happened I sent a player to the brig and He lost interest in the game after that.  The humans made it to warp 6 before quitting under time constraints. This is probably a really good game with people that don't take offense to being picked on or accused.

After the Cylon attack on the Colonies, the battered remnants of the human race are on the run, constantly searching for the next signpost on the road to Earth. They face the threat of Cylon attack from without, and treachery and crisis from within. Humanity must work together if they are to have any hope of survival…but how can they, when any of them may, in fact, be a Cylon agent?
\13\\13\
Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game is an exciting game of mistrust, intrigue, and the struggle for survival. Based on the epic and widely-acclaimed new Sci Fi Channel series, Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game puts players in the role of one of ten of their favorite characters from the show. Each playable character has their own abilities and weaknesses, and must all work together in order for humanity to have any hope of survival. However, one or more players in every game secretly side with the Cylons. Players must attempt to expose the traitor while fuel shortages, food contaminations, and political unrest threatens to tear the fleet apart.

Pretty much New condition. It's been used once in a solo game (trial) but that's it.  I desperately want to play this but given my friends, I don't think it will happen anytime soon.  Chances are I need to find a group to play it and if I do, they'll probably have their own copy of the game.  I wanted to hang onto this because I'm a fan of the show but sometimes sacrifices are necessary.....

RATING: 5
This game, as shipped, is broken. Some of the expansions alleviate this to some extent, but this hunk of krufty game mechanics just isn't fun enough to justify spending more money on top of the initial buy-in.

Some problems:

- Awful communication rules. If I start saying “I can help a WHOLE LOT” every time I’m going to give a 5 as a card, is that cheating? Answer: who the fuck knows.

- Terrible player scaling. For one thing, Battlestar Galactica's "sympathetic cylon" for odd numbers of players is ughhhh. The basic idea was that if humans were far ahead at the midway point, the sympathetic cylon was a real cylon, but if the humans were doing poorly, the sympathetic cylon was on the human side. This was pretty horrible, because whichever side got the sympathetic cylon probably won. So cylons suddenly wanted humans to do well for the first half, while humans actively tried to sabotage themselves. It was weird bizarro land play that went completely against the goals of the game. Also with too few players the witchhunt dynamics sort of fall apart and don't make for a compelling game. I think the game is most playable with exactly 6 players, and pretty awful for every other player count.

- Game length. I don't understand why a game of this depth deserves 6 hours of my time for one playthrough.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A brilliant game design that captures all of the intensity and paranoia of the first two seasons of Battlestar Galactica. Something memorable happens almost every time we play it, but unlike a lot of diplomacy games this one manages not to feel mean. You expect a cylon to turn on you or for your character to be falsely imprisoned at some point, so no one tends to take it personally when it happens. The character roles are well done, both in reflecting the actual character on the show and in influencing decisions that add to the air of distrust. Just an amazing game.

I have only one caveat. I get the feeling that if the game is played too often with the same people, a lot of the suspense will break down. When people start to learn the tendencies of the other players and begin experiencing the same debates over and over, the game's fun factor will probably start to drop off. Limit your plays to every other month or so and you will be able to enjoy one of the best gaming experiences out there.

This is still the best game I've played of its type - I love the tension, the bluffing, the wild accusations, and especially that there's something to do (unlike stuff like Werewolf or The Resistance). It can sometimes run longer than it is interesting, and the random bits can totally screw over people or teams in some games, but the biggest problem I've had lately is finding the nihilism in the game's atmosphere to be oppressive. The theme is really dark, especially if you read the flavor text on the crisis cards, and that really puts a damper on the fun for me at this point in my life.

A very interesting variant where all players had cylon motives to complete and were winning according to the motives only

- I played my [b][u]100th game[/u][/b] (taking into account that i currently play 10 pbf games) on 09-16-12 at the GmG event: Fall-loha in Burlington Vermont USA, a crushing win for the cylon in a one sided game. I was cylon from the start and just sat and watched the humans destroying themselves to put the finishing touch at the end

- Was once shot at +29 with the Admiral's quarter / Cain's ability on the very first turn without even having played a turn or having the chance to make a move, do something... talk about trusting friends :) (I was a cylon though! But really did nothing as it was on the first player turn and i was second!!!)

- Once played Cally who ended up being Admiral, President & CAG at the same time!

- Most BSG games played in a year: 61 (2012)

- [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/775178/bsg-v25-character-flaw/page/1]BSG-PBF: V25[/url] was the most brutal game i ever played... I have never seen a game going so one sided at a point that it became very boring in the end. 100% flawless, ultra perfect game for the cylon side after sleeper phase.

The varied characters and ability cards make it possible for everyone to have an important role in defending against the robotic Cylon traitor hiding among the crew - or giving the Cylon an extra edge in ending the Galactica's voyage.

RATING: 8
Other update: Exodus sort of fixed the Cylon downtime issue (though not playing with the original assault cards sucks).  I feel like it's now too bloated, though: there's a perfect iteration of this that's more tightly developed than the original game.  Exactly what I would write for Game of Thrones and TI3; FFG sticking hard to the 80/20 rule, which makes sense for a company with "staff designers" and a tight production schedule.
-----------
Update: Sure enough, Pegasus on the horizon. And that's cool, but I feel milked.  Moo.
-----------
I like it, but it has some rough edges. It should be shorter and denser. Too much time is lost in uninteresting things. There's plenty of mechanical clutter: why not add another subsystem or two to give more interesting options during Cylon downtime (when no basestar is present)?  My gut feel is that an expansion is already basically done, so some stuff was pared from this, and it shows.

Still, loads to like here if you go for the whole premise, and I do.

RATING: 8
Battlestar Galactica is a ton of fun and I love it to death, but it's not without a few flaws that keep me from placing it in the pantheon just yet. 

First, it's a bit too long.  I know the ATers out there poo poo knocks on game length, but I don't think anyone can claim that being a revealed Cylon for three hours is fun.  Even as a human, some players seem to think it's a bit too long for what it is.  The bottom line is that this game would hit the table every game night if it came in at 90 minutes.  Unfortunately, it's twice that.

Second, some games just aren't as exciting as others.  When the Cylon fleet is bearing down on Galactica, this game is absolutely as fun as gaming gets.  Everybody has something to do and every move feels vitally important.  Two or three jumps in a row with no Cylons?  Not so much.

All that said, I love this game and would play it any time.  Also, since it's from FFG we can expect some expansions.  They are probably unlikely to address the time issue, but I'm almost positive they'll address the lulls-in-action issue, which should make it even more awesome.

Absolutely love this game. I had played it a few times before even watching the show. After watching some of the show, the game is even better, and really utilizes BSG's amazing strengths. The tension of who the Cylons are is engaging, and the game's other mechanics never feel dull.

Part of a bulk online order!

Excellent theme - much better fit than Shadows,  although suffers a bit from the standard fiddly extra mechanics from FFG.  I didn't really consider most locations,  what with flying around outside Galactica (now feels quite inefficient).  

Luck factor seems very high - you're juggling a whole bunch of resources,  and they're being depleted completely at random.  You have a lot of choices,  but most of the time there are pretty obvious things to do - mostly tactical optimizations.  You go through stretches where nothing's going on,  and stretches when there are enemies everywhere.  There's no real strategic planning since you can't guess what the next crisis will be.  Maybe if you could see the next 5 crises you could plan or somesuch,  but then you're in AP/coop driver land...

Main problem is that there aren't that many interesting decisions vs the time it takes - you are pretty much spinning your wheels waiting for the jump drive to spin up to go.  The rest of the game is trying to figure out who the Cylon is/are - once that's figured out,  it's both great - you can make slightly better plans - but bad because it devolves a bit into a pretty random puzzle.  It would almost be more interesting to have Cylons become "robot controlled" players,  and have the player throw his original loyalty cards into the remaining pool and draw a new loyalty card and character card.  Of course,  maybe Cylon reveals would happen every jump rather than voluntarily or would be forced by the brig or somesuch...

Ah yes,  rolling dice to destroy things.  Definitely not a fan.  More random busywork.

Regardless,  my feeling is there's a (very good) 60 minute game trapped in a 3 hour shell here :) The scifi (and BSG) fanboy in me would probably enjoy the current game anyways,  but it's far from a perfect design in my eyes.  It's better than Shadows but solves none of that game's problems.

The bits are very nice.  Solid quality cardboard.  Skill cards are a bit small (the minicard size),  crisis cards are normal sized.

A bit mixed bag in my mind - I like the theme more the Shadows,  but coming off Space Alert it might be potentially a good chunk too long. Then again, this seems to have a working traitors mechanic,  although whether the actions equate to more than spinning wheels in samey-ness will have to be resolved...

Mixed reviews so far - some people say the theme is spot-on and the action is good,  whereas others have reservations about long playtime and lack of interesting things to do (being stuck in the brig,  initial Cylons are the only threat...)

Never forget that this was the first board game you ever bought and that was a pretty good decision.

Remember that time (the second time you played) and you were a cylon from the start. Quietly subverting, nobody suspected there was a cylon at all.

At the end, Mike was convinced Dave was the Cylon and didn't flinch when you threw Dave into the brig. Remember Dave screaming that "if only I could show you the cards!"

What a game.

One game so far and it's for sure candidate for whole 10points. I was wondering of comparing it to the personally high rated "Dead of Winter" (especially kwnowing many "BSG" fans unfair ratings that "Dead of Winer" is not  a good competitor for "BSG"). You know what? Both games are great! Just want to play again.
2016.05.25) So, it's simply the top. Why shouldn't I give it 10/10? It's a pure tension for a whole game (every action of each player is important, it's better not to overlook it!) And I still find some fresh, interesting and increasing suspense mechanics that are waiting to play (e.g. 'executing characters' from game expansion).

I play this game at least twice a year at CamasCon and absolutely LOVE it.  Unfortunately it is a very fiddly game and very long so it is hard getting people near where I live to play it on a regular basis.

The first time you play it you'll just be along for the ride, but the more plays you get under your belt the more the game becomes about the social interaction.  Which is where the game really shines.

This is a perfect translation of the TV show. The only downside is you never know how long it's gonna take. There's a fair amount of strategic depth(game-theory type decisions), but no matter how well people know what they're doing, this game will cause a total chaos: shouts to prove innocence, unjustified accusations, and people asking themselves, "who the heck is cylon?"

RATING: 7
Not a bad game at all, but no one did any streamlining job on this one. It feels like FFG just kept piling up rules upon rules until they thought it was close enough to the actual series to be considered finished.

I really dislike the little exception here and there in the rules that add nothing to the gameplay but make the game more "realistic" as far as the show is concerned. (The Agathon player not being allowed to play during the first turn because, in the series, Agathon starts out stranded on Caprica? Give me a break.)

In the end the game is long and fiddly, with a lot of downtime for everyone involved (*especially* a revealed Cylon). So while it can still be an enjoyable experience with the right crowd, I wouldn't play this one more than a couple times a year.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fine game that develops the paranoia element of the Resistance into a more substantial experience; but overly long, and the core system of overcoming challenges was a little repetitive.  Sold--possibly a mistake--as other games offer similar core pleasures but wrapped into a better game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very tense. The main focus is on the traitor - aspect. The different mechanics provide ways for the Cylon players to try and thwart the human plans while remaining undetected. From the humans' point of view every action is a potential clue for someone's actual identity. The dramatic twists and turns provide memorable gaming moments. I wish there was more to actually *do* in this game.

I assume it's ok if your are Admiral or President. But as a normal player, you don't have many choices during the whole game. Would be ok for a short game, but not for a 3-4 hour one.

RATING: 6
I really liked the situations this game puts you in. I won't claim that all of the decisions are hard to make, or that the game keeps the tension on you the whole time, but knowing there's a Cylon somewhere just lodges something in the back of your head telling you "don't trust them". Combine that with the fact that you might not know that you are a Cylon as well and the game keeps things interesting.

My biggest complaint is the length. If the game was shorter, I'm not sure it would be as good, but with the length now I'm not sure I'd want to play it a ton.

I like the theme because I loved the series (original and new one).  I have played it 7-8 times and for some reason, it seems like it is getting stale to me.  Not sure if it would benefit by the expansions, but I may try that to save it for me.

When I first played this I really enjoyed it... But then The Resistance came along. Resistance has very similar mechanics but within a shorter, cleaner game. You have to play Battlestar Galactica with the right people to make it an enjoyable experience, whereas Resistance is more of a casual game and as such is accessible to most people (as long as they enjoy being deceitful!).

Maybe the best semi-coop game out there with a traitor aspect, and definitely the best franchise game out there in my opinion. Games are always really tense and close. In one of our games it came down to one roll to decide who won. Considering the fact that this is a rules-heavy game, that's a sure sign that this game is perfectly balanced. I will only play it with 5 players though (3 human, 2 cylon).

A great hidden traitor game that plays out very well. It's just very long for a traitor game and it can be hard to teach compared to others making it hard to get to the table when people don't want to invest that much time into it.

A beast of a game around the traitor mechanic. The game in itself (finding Kobol while dealing with the Cylon fleet) is already very cool and thematic. The traitor mechanic drives the whole thing home. A superb match of mechanics and source material, and an absolute must for any Battlestar fan.

Heavily dependent on the group. A lot of systems going on, as the traitor characters try and sabotage a starship from going on its journey.

I don't get to play this one as often as I'd like to due to it's lengthy play time but when I do I love it.   Would not recommend at 3 players.  Not great but tolerable with the right group of 4.  Amazing with 5 players and decent with 6.

Note: There is a no sympathizer variant that gives the cylons more advantages to compensate like less starting resources and more cards when they reveal themselves.  It probably makes the 6 player version a lot better. https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/Battlestar_Galactica/BSG_optional_rules.pdf

Also, kindof note to myself but the expansions add a lot to the game: https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/5lz6hu/should_i_get_battlestar_if_i_didnt_like_dead_of/dbzkvlt/ .  I really wish I could find daybreak and exodus.

After 1st game. I became 2nd Cylon in 2nd draw, we won (morale).

At the beginning game was very exciting, but after than emotions had begun to fall and at the end we were just praying to finish, regardless of result!!! 

(-) The game was too long, it was about 3,5 hours with some explanations. Shadows over Camelot seems to be much quicker.
Lack of reference cards for players was severe, we spent a lot of time leafing pages of rulebook. 
Distribution of the tension was very unbalanced.

(+) Few good mechanisms, climate.

I'm not sure do I want to play any more.

Any ideas for Express version?

This game is so much fun to play.

The journey through space to reach human salvation is very fun with everyone in the group helping each other to make decisions, contribute to skill checks, keeping resources high, and surviving the cyclon attacks.

I got to play as a cyclon and won my game as one, the victory is so tasty as destiny was essentially giving me the final chance to strike the humans and end them and the game. The face of shock when everyone thought I was a human is so great.

Highly recommend this game if you enjoy coop games with a traitor element involved. 
The flaws with the base game is bad crisis card shuffle which can cause a very horrible start for the group as I experienced in the first game where we were just bombarded by constant cyclon attacks. The other unfortunate part of the game is Battlestar galactica takes a long time to play, and my group's 2nd attempt after the first took around 3 hours. We couldn't get another game in.

But I still very much loved playing this game and would play it again.

The positives:

The game now clocks in at 2.5 hours.  That's a good thing.  I'm also impressed with the mechanics of the traitor system, and the brig shenanigans can be fun.

The negatives:

Player actions seem to be relatively obvious. Moreover, the default action seems to be "Executive Order" if you have the card available.

Being tossed into the brig can be a game-killing event for the victimized players.

Finally, compared to other co-ops, the one thing that BSG lacks - accusations aside - is in-depth discussion.  There are three reasons for this:

1. Any player can perform any action (due to unlimited mobility in the ship), and so there is rarely a pressing need for the group to discuss whether actions A and B needed to be accomplished by turn x - since the actions can be performed at any time by nearly any player.

2. Players have no idea what the impending crisis will be on a given turn (crises are randomly drawn), so players can't collectively plan ahead in terms of using/holding skill cards.

3. The skill cards available to each player are a matter of public knowledge.  Consequently, it is fairly obvious whether particular players can pitch in to avert a crisis.  The net result is that not much talk is needed to figure out who can help and who can't.

All of this leads me to believe that the crisis aspect of the game could have used some additional fine-tuning.

There are very few games where I will automatically buy every expansion that comes out, but this is one of them.  Daybreak is likely to be the last, and I have it, so the game is now complete.

It seams that this might be one of this rare items for me:
"As a game it sucks ... as an experience it is quite good."

I found it boring as a game. We had very few to do that made any sense. We discovered cylon pretty early in the game but we did not mange to put him the brig so it did not do us any good. We were killed by the constant activation of cylon fleet and there was not much we could do as our only pilot was cylon. So we just watched as civilian ships are destroyed and our populations is going down to zero. Still I sense it might be fun when you are not so screwed by luck (we made only one jump!).

Posiblemente el mejor juego semicooperativo. En el juego habrá dos bandos: el bando humano y el bando cylon. Los jugadores humanos tendrán que intentar lograr llevar una nave a un lugar seguro. Los jugadores cylon tratarán de sabotear la nave y acabar con la humanidad. Lo mejor de todo es que los cylon estarán ocultos hasta que les descubran los humanos o decidan revelarse. Juego largo y complejo, con mucha negociación y sospechas, pues no sabes si estás haciendo tratos con un humano o un cylon.

That game has been poured into theme and is a must-have for any new-BSG fan. The quality of the components is high, on par with FFG's best productions. However more miniatures come with the extensions, which makes the whole game a bit nicer to look at.
Game mechanics are on the easy side as the essence of the game lies within the interaction between players in order to find the cylon. That makes solo play a lot frustrating since there is not much chrome to enjoy.
I also guess that hardcore fans of the series must have a blast roleplaying their character.

This is a fun semi-cooperative game.  It builds well, and somewhat deceptively.  This is the 1st game I have ever played with a "traitor" aspect (not counting red november because that is very different)  I really enjoyed the acusations and the paranoia having a potential traitor instilled.  I like the skill test mechanic and how you have to give up resources in order to prevent bad things from happening.  and you can't necessarily know who was giving up which resources.

Didn't like this game.  I think it could be good, but there were a few things that really bothered me. First and foremost, I feel like the decks could use a bit of variety.  There were cards worth 2, 3, 4+ points in a skill check ... but they all had exactly the same effect. I found that rather repetitive. The in-ship combat was ok, using just a single die to resolve, but if you were on the wrong side of the Galactica, it took too many turns to get in position to do anything.  I'm hoping that was an overlooked rule (was taught at game night without reading the rules myself), but the repetitiveness of the cards turned me away from this one.

{ P - 2 3 4 5 [6] [7] }

In Arkham Horror, the investigators are fighting an uphill (possibly unwinnable) battle if the mythos deck is too hostile, and the same concept applies to BSG, except here the deck's degree of brutality directly benefits one of the teams. The flagship example of this was a game I played where the beginning was perfect - no discernable Cylon, morale in red - and then the second half completely went to shreds as nearly every new draw deposited enemy cruisers around the Galactica and two power outages forestalled the humans from jumping away from them. Amusingly, the Cylon from round one was dealt the second Cylon card and gave it to me after the humans were already seeing the writing on the wall, arbitrarily handing me a share of the victory when it was technically unnecessary.

Another problem is that the Cylons have little wiggle room, especially in the first half; considering the game state, there's always an optimum play that a given player should perform, and if he doesn't it's logical to conclude he's the Cylon. Skill checks that matter are usually Senate Hearing Committee'd, and it's not particularly difficult to deduce a Cylon throwing negative cards on skill checks by remembering who contributed and who didn't and which destiny deck cards have already passed. I've never played as Cylon before but it seems the only real way to hinder the humans is lucksack into Senate Committees and Execute Orders, then hold them the entire game.

Characters are typically boring as well; other than the flavor and special ability they're just card drawing machines, and you can expect to perform one function the entire game, usually three hours. (My second game I played Execute Orders on people well over 50% of my turns, and President typically does the same thing with Quorum cards.)

RATING: 7
Played it once, which isn't nearly enough for a game like this. For me it's difficult to find players who like to play this game. So that's the main problem. The impression i got so far is good. It has very interesting elements and if everyone enjoys playing it, is willing to take their role seriously, i'm sure this game could be epic. But the "battlefield" around the ship didn't really got to me and looked a bit messy in mechanics, but maybe we did some things wrong. The, "oh, there they come, we have to jump", then jump and start all over and repeating business of paying the cards to prevent disasters from happening seems a bit repetitive to me. But again, i should play it more to really understand all the details and game mechanics for what it really is. 

I wonder if this game should take so long though ... but that's only an issue if it's not so fun to play.

Roll a die to pick the winner would be more fun than this.  If you're playing against a couple Cylons that aren't total idiots, you lose.  No possible way to win.

Wow, This game is so much more than the rules. The best game I ever had (as a human) was the one where I was convinced we were toast for about 30 minutes, and was just waiting for the sweet merciful finishing blow... then we pulled it together and eeked out a victory - Somehow - Just like in the show.

Not very good.  It's just not.  If you get dealt the cylon card you'll be bored silly, as you'll either be in jail and doing nothing, or revealed and doing little to nothing, with no real decisions or strategy to plan.

Furthermore, revealing as a cylon is a sure win for the cylons, so it doesnt make sense to not reveal.  Then you sit in the corner with nothing much to do, and the human players fight a game they will never win, making repetitive decisions that have little meaning.

All this takes 4 to 5 hours! Ugg.

The only drama is to drag out the who is the cylon by not revealing, and that's nearly impossible to accomplish.  The human players quickly break the rules in dropping hints that are nearly out and out cheating in telling thier loyalty, so unless you're a professional actor, the whole thing just doesnt work.  And when the traitor dynamic breaks apart, the game is left with nothing redeeming.

Really, skip it.

(Trade Interest: medium) haven't really reached a full conclusion on this one yet.  it's kind of fun to be guessing who the cylon is.  assusation fly, and the slightest hitch in play of cards can send you down the wrong path.  it's pretty difficult to win, especially if you get a bad run of cards.  Fuel seems to be one you NEVER want to waste, since it is required for almost every single jump card.

on further plays, i think the game lasts too long, and doesn't hold interest, and not sure if anyone would be devoted enough to get good enough to make the game shorter.  too bad.  i really like the theme.

7 after 1 play.

Numerous fiddly rules, presumably to recreate various features of the TV show, though the game is essentially about betrayal and spies. Other semi-cooperative games probably recreate the main mechanic well without so many fiddly bits. The sympathiser mechanic is well-designed as it acts as a balancer between the humans and cylon factions.

Having said the above, I can understand why it is well-liked by fans of the TV show or science fiction.

The only game I have that's been a hit with virtually everyone I've ever presented it to, except for one stick in the mud who thought it took too long, BSG is a cooperative game with a twist...one or more players are secretly working against everyone else, which gives this a "poker" factor involving the human element that makes every game unique depending on who's playing. It perfectly captures the concept of the show as well, especially the tension of wondering when the cylons are going to suddenly "jump" in from out of nowwhere to attack the fleet. Seriously, can't stress it enough...out of the the twenty or so people who've I've taught the game to, and these aren't "game" people for the most part, nearly ALL of them won't stop talking about the game for days afterward. A must buy.

A co-op with traitor mechanics... If you know the show, it's an interesting experience, however, the actions you get to take seem obvious or your choices seem extremely limited... played with a few chunks of some of the expansions... good as an "entertainment" game, but only ok as an actual board game... (grain of salt: I like heavy euros)

Enjoyable. Possibly the best traitor-mechanic game I've played. Seems to have some balance issues to my mind: in particular I feel the incentive for cylon-players to remain undetected for the whole game isn't big enough. Note that this is based on one play.

Fantastic game, if you're a fan of Battlestar Galactica the TV show, then you'll love this for sure! It perfectly captures the feel of the show, both in the paranoia, and how you're desperately trying to keep one step ahead of the Cylons. Very good game, and hidden traitor games is something I enjoy overall.

I'm also quite happy about the game being deep, and involved enough to be fun mechanically, so it's not just living purely on its theme. The constant player interaction is top notch. You are constantly involved, and interested in every aspect of the game. I don't even understand the people who complain about this game's downtime?! This is one of my all-time favorites.

Not too bad for a co-op. Our Cylones had a really hard time of it. Didn't feel particularly challeneged with it. Theme seems okay but I haven't seen the show. Would prefer Shadows or Arkham if I was in the co-op mood.

Update: On a second play, will never play again, 4 hour snooze fest that was all downtime because of randomness of card pulls and PA by a couple players. The dullest, longest game play of my life. 

Why play a long dull co-op when pandemic and lord of the rings are just as good with none of the downtime?

RATING: 5
My first play of this was terrible... but after additional plays I found that session was mostly marred by a bad group and I've found I enjoy this game quite a bit with the right people.  It is especially helpful to play with folks that take their turns quickly as there is quite a bit of fiddly/draggy stuff written right into the rules.  More experience than strategy here and I prefer the clean cut "The Resistance" for traitor suspense... but if you have 3-4 hours to blow this can be a good time.

RATING: 6.5
Thematic and wonderfully produced.  Although Battlestar Galactica introduced some interesting mechanics into its gameplay, ultimately the experience was far too long for what it is.

Obviously the most recognized aspect of BSG is the traitor and the sleeper agent phase, where former teammates could become the cylon everyone have been working to fight off.  To distribute the loyalty cards a second time midway through the game is a brilliant way to shake things up.  Furthermore, I really do like how skill checks are performed.  It allows for subtle sabotage without giving away one's identity, which is often a critique against Shadows Over Camelot.

Unfortunately, there is just way too much downtime, and as much as I love playing with the full complement in a co-op game, every single turn seem to take forever to complete.  Add to that the lack of variety in skill cards; the numerous die rolls involved when activating raiders, especially if you are besieged by too many; as well as how long it takes to resolve each crisis, the game just drags after the initial newness wears off.  With that said, I don't see myself playing this very often.  Good effort, but not destined to be a favorite or a classic.

One of my favorite games.  Just really enjoy the co-op with traitor element in this one.  I also really enjoyed the show so the theme is really good for me.  I play a lot of Play By Forum but I do not record those on here.  I've played at least 10 PBF games by now.

RATING: 10
The king of traitor games. No other game does traitoring as well as BSG. The base game is almost flawless out of the box. The Pegasus expansion adds even more options for dealing with cylons (and for cylons to do dirt). The other expansions don't add that much. For the best experience use the Defcon variant to keep Cylon attacks from coming too often or too seldom. The only thing that keeps this from being a masterpiece is that it takes a little tweaking to balance the Crisis deck and Super Crisis Cards.

A different breed of co-op. This game focuses mostly on the communication between players over bulky game mechanics or tactics, which I like. I don't like the photo-artwork, personally I would prefer illustrations or minis because a bunch of still captures doesn't feel like a boardgame to me.
This is one of the best co-ops I've played.

Having not played Battlestar for a very long time, I was roped back in to a game in its tail end; I suddenly remembered why I disliked this game so much.  The game takes too long, downtime is incredibly painful as you wait for players to do 'something', and also I don't think the decisions are even interesting or meaningful.  Once uncovered as a Cylon your decision making drastically goes down to a scripted choice.  I do not like Battlestar for its theme, or because of hidden bad guys, but because it simply takes too long and its not something I want to play again.

A cooperative game with a secret traitor primarily focused around collective resource allocation in complex scenarios with significant hidden knowledge. With roles/powers, secret traitors, and collective win conditions it reminds me a bit of Dune.

I played for the first time at The Bistro.  It was a 4 player game.  It was great at first, but once the sympathiser became a cylon and the admiral was a cylon as well, the game quickly went downhill.  I was impossilbe for us to get the cyclon in the brig, so there was no reason for him to expose himself.  We stopped playing as it was quite obvious we couldn't win.
I will play again and would like to play with a few more in the game.

2009-05-11: [b][bgcolor=#ff66cc] 4.5 [/bgcolor][/b] It think the game implements the show really well, but the downtime is a killer.  That, and even when we had three basestars and wads of raiders threatening a throng of civilians, I didn't really feel any tension:  The FTL was pretty much ready to go, and we popped out from under them.  It emulated the show beautifully, except I was not nervous whatsoever.  I blame this on myself, though:  I think I've lost the emotional investment in collaborative games.  Fortunately, excellent company makes up for my lack of engagement by the game, so I can be talked into it by sufficiently charming people....

I really appreciated the card mechanism to allow subversive play.  It was reminiscent of [gameid=8671] (another mostly-collaborative game) combined with the undercover cop variant for [gameid=19237], in that the group contributes cards to overcome a crisis ([gameid=8671]), with the temptation to hold on to cards for personal gain ([gameid=8671] again), but the subversion happens in a probably secretive way, such that the moles can keep tunneling.... ([gameid=19237])  The excellent thing that [gameid=37111] adds is a pair of fate cards, allowing cylons to gamble and undermine the effort with a chance of not even letting anyone know there is any subversion whatsoever.  Countering that is the ability to force card play to be face-up for a crisis.

Again, as I said about [gameid=30549], I think anybody with any affinity for collaborative games, but (in this case) who can slot up to four hours of playtime will love this game.  If you enjoyed the show, you will probably enjoy the game that much more.

2010-12-29: [b][bgcolor=#cc99ff] 5 [/bgcolor][/b] As you slog through this, it gets a bit more tolerable, and can get a little engrossing.  Still not my cup of tea, but I [b]can[/b] be convinced, when I have nothing better to do for four hours.  Yes, sure, once everyone's played it many times, you can squirt it out in two hours.  While that's a much more acceptable timeframe, I hope I never get enough experience for that.  ;)

The base game is really cool, and so faithful to the show that it can even increase enjoyment of the show, as well as the other way around. 

The hidden traitor mechanic as well as the constant crises make for a tense game most of the time. Even when the humans are doing amazing and no resources in the red when you get to sleeper phase, the game can turn on a dime and victory is never assured.

RATING: 9
The desperate struggle of the last remnants of humankind against the overwhelming Cylon attacks - and their own, inner demons - feels just as breathtaking as in the television series. On its best with players who have watched through the whole show. Every victory for humankind is hard-earned indeed, and always tight. Very rewarding for the Cylons, too. Playing out all the suspicions and paranoia regarding Cylon infiltrators is essential - without it, the game would be underwhelming. The question is not if you're too paranoid - it's if you're paranoid *enough*. After all, even the cat in the house *could* be a Cylon infiltrator!

I love this game. It's such a depressing, desperate struggle for the humans to survive and defeat the Cylons. It's just like the show. When I initially saw the board, I was concerned that there wasn't enough to do. Oh how I was wrong. After playing a few games, the Cylon threat can quickly stack up and drive the humans to the point of extinction. On top of the board throwing Cylons at you. You also need to figure out who among you is also a Cylon. Such a great game with loads of hilarity among true friends.

Играли вшестером и в первый раз. Игра затянулась на 5 часов, но так и не доиграли - люди сдались. Оказалось что карты кризиса плохо перемешаны и люди не выдержали 5 атак Сайлонов подряд (да ещё и два раза 0_o). Но зато все разобрались и в следующий раз игра пойдёт быстрее и интересней. В целом мне понравилось.

upd: с опытными игроками играть намного интересней, однако появилось мнение о дисбалансе карт президента (кворума), в частности атаки за счёт морали, однако не надо забывать, что карты повышения ресурсов при успешном использовании убираются из игры

PROS: Great game. Thematically accurate to TV series and still tactically sound. Very interactive, minimal down-time as you are constantly watching each others moves and listening for clues that suggest the truth of player loyalties, Very easy to learn for anyone who wants to learn it (usually mastered within 3-4 game rounds). Very much non-stop action. 

CONS: Needs minimum 3 players, NOT recommended for heavily competitive players or bullies (i.e.: people who enjoy making their colleges suffer)

Wow, the tension in this game is high and it just increases with each turn. As soon as the first mission fails, name calling and paranoia starts to spread over the table.

The end of the game will either be the bad guys winning or the good guys winning by an incredibly small margin. 

Aside from a small problem of occasional Analysis Paralysis, the game is really enjoyable. You'll see the time fly with this one.

After 1 Play: Just isn't my type of game.  Some people really get into the story, but if you're looking for interesting mechanics and decisions, I'd suggest you look elsewhere.  From my experience, luck is far more of a factor in determining the outcome than either skillful play or correctly identifying the cylons.  In my one and only game, there was only one cylon in the beginning, but as he was a new player he didn't really know how to subvert the humans without revealing himself.  The humans were doing nearly perfect when I became the other cylon halfway through.  Still, one well timed betrayal and a couple crippling cards in a row turned that great start into defeat.

This is one of those games, I wish I would like - but somehow I can´t. It is not a bad game and it really feels like reliving the tv-show, which in itself might be enough for some people to love this game, but... BUT it doesn´t get me hooked at all. And I think there are quite some reasons - the 3 major ones for me:
1.) It doesn´t really feel necessary to uncover the Z, since the damage potential seems almost higher when acting openly against the humans. 
2.) I often have the feeling of being played by the game instead of playing/deciding myself, since the combination of upcomming crysis on the one hand and my special role/power often leave just one good course of action.
3.) Lack of a climax. Jumping for the last and final time is not much different from the very first jump - or the third or fourth for that matter. For me, it lacks the sense of achievemet or final showdown.

Played once, a long time ago. The game's great fun, but I can see the enjoyment of it depending heavily on the group. So, with a group of heavy thinkers who care only about mechanics, subtract a point. Scratch that, take two or three. In a group laden with roleplay and a focus on atmosphere, add a point.

The group I played with was in the middle of the two extremes, and the game played very well, with lots of paranoia going on - which is lovely.

Edit: Played some more. Would be up for a game of this almost anytime, but my initial thoughts held true.

The best coop game with a traitor mechanism that also is always exciting and leaves you with a story to tell. The paranoid atmosphere that the game creates is unmatched in other coops. The game leaves room for heroic memorable memories : will you be the one that saves the ship from a boarding centurion or successfully activate the ftl  while the galactica is under heavy fire and all raptors are down.

Minor negative: the Sympathizer is not very fun.

As far as co-ops go (or semi co-ops however you wanna put it) this is a decent one. I just don't like any co-op games. When I play a game I have my strategy and I don't want to have to argue with everyone else at the table about it. Plain and simple if a game requires argument I don't find it enjoyable.

A nice mix of role playing, coop and suspicion.

One of the most highly immersive games out there which is still relevant up to these days. Would be higher if it were shorter.

One of the very few cooperative games I have actually enjoyed - obviously due to the traitorous Cylons. Still I felt that at times this was just a multiplayer puzzle and not an actual game. Also, one card felt a bit broken (the one giving two actions to another player).

VERY thematic, which is a plus.

A wonderfully immersive experience (even for those that have never seen the show, like myself) that can be quite long and difficult to teach, but is rewarding and creates an excitement that is rare in many board games.

Own the Pegasus expansion.

Some interesting mechanics, and fun to get into the roles; as always the unknown betrayer element builds some nice tension. However, the pacing of the events can be really uneven, and in the case of Cylon ship attacks things always seem to reset with the jump just at it's getting interesting. In the best case scenario that is; often nothing really builds up at all, and the event cards get a little lack-luster after a while. Biggest flaw, however, is the length of the game, needs to be an hour shorter at least.

UPDATE: The Cylon fleet expansion seems to go a long way towards fixing the pacing issues of the fleet cards in the original deck. Played with other expansions but none feel as essential, although if you like the game most are worth trying out; just don't play with everything together. Still too long, unless one side plays poorly or gets incredibly unlucky.

1/22/09 -- Not sure what all of the hype is about. I know people love the TV show (I've never seen it), and I assume that's the only thing bolstering this game's ratings.  It's mechanisms are bland, card play is unexciting, and it seems to favor the Cylons.  Not for me.

11/30/08 -- First game was pretty boring.  Will not seek out another play, but will not turn down one if offered since it will be interesting to see if the second play will yield any hidden "delights".  Could potentially be improved by hand jobs from the President.

Very good, though the downtime as a Cylon drags on a bit.

I like the paranoic feel of this game when every human is suspecting everybody else. Carton basestars are not looking good, but it is solved in Pegasus expansion.

Back in the day, I played this game quite a bit and it may have even been my favorite. There was nothing like it that blended a thematic strategy game with traitor mechanics (at least that I'd played). Nowadays, this has gotten shelved for Dead of Winter since it's not as finicky about player counts and nobody cares about the show/theme anymore. Personally, I preferred the fact that we *knew* there were traitors somewhere once we passed the halfway point, which pushed us to point fingers at each other over every action, every twitch, every smile. In Dead of Winter, we look around the table anxiously, but it feels like a coop game first with a phenomenal traitor element smuggled in. Battlestar Galactica puts the traitor element in the front of everyone's mind, with some co-op mechanics involving blowing up frakkin' cylons and firing up the FTL to back it up.

Anyway yes this game is exceptional... with exactly 5 players. The expansions do improve upon the awful, non-thematic cylon sympathizer role, but it's meant to be played with 5 players.

Demoed, purchased and played at Gencon.  It's the best game of the con in my opinion.  Just drips flavor. 

After 10 plays, the rating dipped a bit as each game feels a bit samey.  Still good, I just am not being pulled back to it as much as I thought I would.

UPDATE:  Still dropping in rating.  I find I am having less fun each time it hits the table.  It's overlong for what it is.

My favorite coop game. As a fan of the series I frakking love it. But I really need to learn to play as a Cylon :\

Superb game.  So many elements are right with this game it's hard for me to suggest any negatives. Perhaps 3 hours is a *little* too long, but really, all players are involved at all times, that doesn't seem to matter.
Hands down the best secret role game I've played.  Hands down the best co-op game I've played (or semi co-op).  Hands down the best Fantasy Flight Games game I've played.  Recommended to all.

Kiemelkedően jó paranoia játék. Remek taktikai lehetőségek vannak benne. Bár hosszú, de minden perce izgalmas és pörgős. Nincs két egyforma menet, mindig vannak meglepetések. Bár kell hozzá egy jó csapat, és az összes kiegészítő, hogy igazán megmutassa az erejét. Sértődősöknek nem ajánlom.

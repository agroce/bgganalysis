RATING: 8.1
Rating this game has proven quite challenging (I must admit I've changed my rating several times already).

As a hobbyist game designer, I really appreciate a lot of what has been done here with regard to mechanics.  It addresses some things that have been plaguing recent games, and I think it really pushes the frontier forward on several fronts, which is a major feat (good on you, EV).  It also seems to have few mechanical issues (given my limited experience with it).  The game designer in me wants to give this about a 9.

All of that said, I didn't have much fun.  I don't particularly want to play it again; I wouldn't mind, but I'm not going to be asking for it.  This part of me wants to give it about a 6.5.  And as much as I want to base a rating on an abstract appreciation, isn't an enjoyable experience the bottom line?  

All of that said, ratings are meant to be useful to others.  The difficulty comes in trying to discern to what extent the reasons I didn't have fun are specific to me.  To do that, I need to understand them, so here goes:

-Harvester puts my micro-goals in limbo (I might still get a chance to buy that card, if/when it comes up again)
-Wax Kingdom requires tracking, which (like, say, Carcassone) makes you choose between tedium and disadvantage.
-Cards have both mechanical depth and flavor, but they seem pretty separate, so I ignored the flavor and it hurt immersion in the fluff.  (Mentally, I was putting the card that grants immunity and lets me draw 2 in the place that lets me use special abilities, because it's not clear why sending my Paperboy to the Bazaar would do either of those things.)
-VPs (here, candles) are fine in a fluff-lite game, but if I'm to get into the feel of a fantasy setting, I want to know who I am and what I'm fighting/working for.  I didn't.

(I imagine at least half of this would disappear for those familiar with Don't Rest Your Head, but I don't know anyone familiar with Don't Rest Your Head.)

Anyway, put all that into a calculator/blender and we get... 8.1

I am a huge fan of the source material for this, so that may make me more biased than most. Simple, solid deckbuilder type game. Not sure on the replay value, but still enjoyable for some plays at least.

While this game has a really interesting horror theme, being based in the world of the "Don't Rest Your Head" RPG, the game-play is very divorced from that theme. So in essence, you only remember what the theme is during play when you make an effort to remember. This is in no way a criticism, however, as it makes the game fun for people who are normally not a fan of horror games. The combination of deck-building and worker-placement mechanics is surprisingly intuitive and enjoyable. So whether you are a fan of the genre or not, try it out!

Backed this on Kickstarter.  Amazing art, graphic design, and theme (I think Don't Rest Your Head is a phenomenal bit of inspired horror).  Excellent twist on worker placement with five areas crucial to winning the game, each with sharply limited space.  Each player has their own set of workers/cards available to buy, meaning there's no competition for specific cards as in many other deckbuilders, but that's made up for by the extremely limited board space (which influences the cards you can buy).  I think the only missed opportunity in this game's design is that card effects are only activated by a single sector on the board; passive effects that trigger in other sectors could have added more variety and heavily influenced the luck/strategy mix.  Otherwise, very solid game with high replayability.

Very smooth blend of area control/worker placement/deck builder.  A relatively light game with some character and just enough meat to have you coming back.

I don't like this game. Very mechanical, little variety, not many decisions, tactical (I see no possibility of using strategy) and luck driven. Final points are based on cards in your deck, so you can't optimize it for good performance and you should buy cards with many points without limit, making the game more and more luck driven.

Bad materials in general, except for board, that is ugly but well made. The Box is excellent.

Combines deck building (each player builds his own deck from an identical set of cards; the variation comes in the order in which each player's cards become available to buy) and worker placement (the board has one area for buying cards, one for performing card special abilities, and three for scoring points) in a very straightforward way.

To be honest, despite the fact that the rulebook contains a ton of flavor story text and the card artwork is evocative, the mechanics feel extremely generic -- you could paste pretty much any theme you wanted onto the components. The board is very functional, but very bland. I wasn't familiar with the setting and didn't read the flavor text ahead of time, and I felt like I was playing an abstract game with random goth character cards.

That said, there's nothing wrong with abstract games. I had fun and felt like my decisions impacted the outcome, and the game didn't overstay its welcome. This isn't a "let's get together and play this game" kind of game; it's a "we've got an hour to kill and I'm in the mood for something a little meatier than a filler" game. Taken for what it is, it's not bad.

This one has an interesting premise (the RPG is an interesting premise in itself), but ultimately boils down to a simple worker-placement, hand-management game.  The fact that all the player decks are the same means that the only true asymmetry is going to come from what's available to be bought.  While it has deckbuilding mechanisms, I would not call this a deckbuilder.

Interesting deck builder game where each player has EXACTLY the same upgraded cards which they can add to their deck and each card is unique, so its less about building an engine and driving it hard for points than it is about utilising the cards you have got this turn to your advantsge and hoping to score more than your opponents

I really like that not all cards can be played to every area and that each area can hold a limited number of cards forcing players to consider which cards they need to play, where they need to play them and when.

I like that each of the 5 game board areas does something very different with the cards, utilising them in different ways for example one area strips them from your deck using them for final scoring, whereas another area simply lets you use the card text, possibly drawing you more cards. Player interaction is high due to the limited spaces available in each area which is very unusual in a deck builder and actually quite a refreshing change

I really like the art style here and some of it is truly creepy, which fits really well with the theme.

Overall quite different to what I was expecting as this is certainly very different to your standard deck builder, I these differences are refreshing and interesting and I look forward to more games of this soon.

Deckbuilding with private supplies of unique-in-your-deck cards. You play the cards into regions in a worker-placement-like fashion - cards have a strength, which regions they can be played into, and sometimes a special effect if played into a specific region.

I liked the horror art.

This game is alright if you don't have anything else on hand to play. I've played about a dozen times but it doesn't offer much in terms of the game play fitting the theme. There is definitely a disconnect there. The artwork is mediocre and upon first opening everything, it was very confusing trying to figure out what the game was about. There is some text on the box that helps sum things up, but that should have been in the introduction of the manual to help clarify some things. Every once in awhile I find myself enjoying some of the mechanics and then I think, I could be playing any number of other games that present these elements in a better way. Meh.

RATING: 7
As a worker-placement game, this was a fun and unusual romp, since every worker has their own quirks (special powers, which areas it can be placed into) and the action blocking is more like area control than straight up Agricola "I get this resource and you don't".

As a deck-builder, this was dry and frustrating, and in need of more variability.

On balance I liked it, but I'm a little sad that the card game I thought this might be doesn't really exist.

I should state up front that I don't like horror-themed games much.  I like the idea of the mechanics in the game and it works, although I wished I had just a little more control.  I would play again, but I don't think I'd pick it up because of the theme primarily.

The combination of deck building with worker placement is very intriguing and enjoyable.  Many deck builders let players focus on their engine and play almost a solitaire game, but the worker placement makes players pay attention to what their opponents are doing or else they will lose critical scoring opportunities.

I only wish each character had a different (even slightly so) acquisition deck to make them feel even more differentiated, though I realize this would require much more development work.

I really liked how all the pieces fit together -- there is a lot of subtle strategy in what cards you buy based on where they can be played (as well as their special powers), and a lot of different ways you can interact with other players via the board.  I found the intertwined mix of deck-building, worker placement, and area majority to be quite pleasing.  There were interesting tactical and strategic plays.

RATING: 2.9
chaotic deckbuilder with lots of "take-that" (theft, denial, etc) as well as area control with lots of chances for blocking. every player has their own market which should lessen the randomness and chaos, but instead can provide one player an advantage or disadvantage via random shuffle. that's not to say there's no strategy, just that careful planning is in no way guaranteed to pay off. if you like the idea of a game where anyone could win and if the gothy wax-punk theme appeals, then your group may have found a replacement for Munchkin.

I love the idea of a deck builder worker placement and this one is pretty fun. Not a big fan of the cards in the game that drop people in points. I've had a really good turn where I got a whole bunch of candles and then had that completely negated on the following turn because of card effects. Not fun.

I've played this game several time in playtest versions (and now in a shining-new copy), and it's my favorite Vogel design, and overall a very enjoyable game. It doesn't exactly scratch the deckbuilding itch, because deckbuilding is one of many mechanics, not the core of the game (like in Dominion or Ascension). With that said, it's a really nice melding of deckbuilding, worker placement, and majority control that allows for the sorts of strategy and (more importantly) player interaction that you don't see in a typical deckbuilder. The artwork is also a totally kickbutt and spooky vision of the theme, which is perfect.

Mechanically, this is one of the more interesting games I've played in a long time. The mix of deck building and area control is pretty unique, and lends itself to some interesting choices, given that not all cards can be played in all areas.

The theme is, well, creepy, but that's intentional. I played a production sample game with Eric, and I have to say the artwork is very well done, but I keep wanting to play the same game with a different theme. (Yes, I will say it: if it was some soulless euro-style theme, I'd grab it in a minute.) My wife laughed at the description of the game's universe, which means I might get it after all, but I'll just have to try to not think about the theme too much.

Seems like a neat game. I'm just not sure how well the cards are balanced. I noticed one card that costs 2 and can be used in certain areas, while there is another card with the same cost and the only difference is it can be used in an extra area. Seems like there should be a cost difference there or something else to differentiate the two.

Oddly, this game feels similar to Medieval Academy to me. The gameplay is completely different, but it's similar in that you play cards to different areas and each area operates differently (one area scores you points at the end of the round, one scores end-game points, etc) which is really similar to how the different tracks work in Medieval Academy.

Will rate after more plays, but so far it seems good.

Pretty fun game. I would enjoy playing it in the future, though it seems like a game that would be very frustrating to play against a more experienced player.

The cards are all unique and have some interesting ideas. This is a bit of a double sided knife, though. It means that the acquisition row is a bit overwhelming.

The art is atmospheric and scary, but also a bit indistinct and muddy.

I did not really play the deck building mechanic much, and got a decent advantage from it. It could be caused by the players I was playing with.

Interesting mash of mechanics. It's a deck builder where the cards are used as worker placement to further build your deck. Seems like it's a little better with 3 or 4 players to compete for space and give the interactive cards more value. Very interesting design but maybe lacks polish.

GAME: Keltis: Das Orakel
RANK: 1995
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's a Knizia, so forget about theme.  In fact, this is a weird Celtic themed takeoff of Keltis, which is simply a board game version of the differently (but still themeless) Lost Cities.  Now all that said, this is MUCH better than Keltis/Lost Cities: the board game, and has mechanics similar to the somewhat enjoyable Lost Cities.

Basically you are moving pawns forward on a spiral path trying to get your points where you can.  To score: a) move the lady onto a spot with your pawn, b) land on a point scoring space, c) "cash in" on the cloverleaf space (can only be done once in the game), d) acquire gems, and even better acquire mirrors to "reflect" (read: increase) their end game value (but watch out, as the scoring table gives you negative points for low numbers of gems), e) finish the game on a positive point scoring space. 

Mechanics are straightforward and similar to Lost Cities- play a card of a given colour in a sequence, but either ascending OR descending order.  Once played, you're locked in, unless you get lucky with the cloverleaf squares.  Or do a straight discard instead of playing a card.  Then draw a card either from the deck or a discard pile.  Game ends when the deck runs out (like Lost Cities) OR when someone gets all three pawns into the "special area" (the high scoring end game spaces).  Very simple to play, but does have a bit of tension and decision making, hampered of course by the cards you draw.  One nice aspect is the board is variable each time due to the mostly random placement of tiles.  If this won the SdJ, I would've been more than fine with that, but Keltis?  Get serious.  Still waiting for Keltis: das Orakel the card game to come out.

By the way, this game is available for iPhone/iPad and is pretty fun other than the annoying touch interface issues.

RATING: 5
Another version of Keltis.  In this one the signature sequences of cards only matter in terms of limiting your movement options.  There's a hatful of in-game scoring options, including a priestess, who wanders in the same direction as you and bestows five points if you can land her on your space.  There are also the familiar wishing stones and points for progression along the path from the original Keltis.  

Das Orakel does feel a bit more free form with more strategic options than the original.  However, ultimately it's still only Keltis with a couple more bells and whistles, and my sense of ennui with this series is deepening.

Production quality is decent, although, as with other games in this line, the card quality isn't great.  The artwork is the hokey emerald isle stuff that I have come to loath.  The rules are clear.

Belongs to the family, but plays really different from Keltis.  Keeps the basic mechanism to add cards to the table, but the use of cards is more complex.  It has several ways of scoring, and somehow it feels like aritificial.  A bit too fiddly for what it really offers, but not a bad game.

The whole family of Keltis games comprises little fancy games built on some variation of board movement, while keeping the original clever but not-so-enticing play-cards-in-order mechanic.
Nothing should tickle the gamer in me, but everyone of these games is quite enjoyable when played against my girlfriend, and this one makes no exception.
Das Orakel, along with Keltis Erweiterung, is more on the gamery side of things, so I enjoy those two more than the others. And they feel different enough when played, to be both firmly in my collection...

RATING: 6
Could go up to an 8, but probably no higher. I appreciate this as Lost Cities "Advanced", and a number of the elements are very clever in a Knizia way. Of particular note are the point thresholds, from the big jump for every even-numbered treasure(?) tile to the big jumps between final spaces on the board. That said, I don't get excited by the prospect of playing. As a friend said, it's a great game to play when you're too tired for something more thinky.

Yeah, this is the best one, followed closely by New Ways, New Plays, then the card game, then the tile game, then the original. The cards become just a way to limit the possible options you have for moving your pieces. Lots more freedom of movement, and choice of strategy. Also, the tiles layout really does modify the available strategies. Since these keep getting better, I wonder what is next?

Player the IOS version, maybe it's too fiddly to be a family game with many tiles making different stuff...

I enjoy playing it, but to play with my family I'd prefer the original Keltis or the cards version that I own. On the other hand it's too tactical and luck dependient to pelease gamers, so I'd keep playing no my IPad.

RATING: 10
Update: over 20 plays in on the physical board and dozens and dozens (hundreds?) on iOS, this is such a fantastic game. The card play is well integrated into the overall design, and the flexibility of movement forward and backward along the spiral path is both restrictive and fluid enough to provide real meaningful decisions. The scoring opportunities are extremely well balanced, and the game plays equally well across the player count spectrum. Simply superb, and should've won the SdJ.

Rating based on playing the iPad app.  It's a very unique game and I enjoy playing it on iPad immensely.  I have played lots of Lost Cities but none of the other Keltis games.

RATING: 7
It's a fine game, but I am getting a little tired of all of these lost city/keltis games.  While I admire Knizia's ability to milk the living daylights out of the franchise, at some point the artwork etc becomes a little stale.

Still, one of the better games in the series.  It does seem to me though that gems are a little too powerful/important.

RATING: 6

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I like this a lot, as once again Knizia has taken the basic Keltis engine and mixed it up into something totally new. Much more tactical, with more looking ahead to multi-move combos and setting up tactical board position. It reminds me a little bit of a shade of Taj Mahal: some of the game is looking at what the layout of the special action spaces is, and judging what strategic elements (stones, leprechauns, oracle) might work and what will be tricky. The layout of the colors on the board is very clever and adds a little bit of asymmetry to the suits.

It is, I think, significantly more complicated than Keltis, and casual gamers are unlikely to grasp it the first time through - there are a lot of moving parts and some of it is pretty subtle. But as a more "gamerly" Keltis/Lost Cities, I like it a lot.

Note: The basic/advanced version of the clovers, where you have to advance the piece you move in the regular game and can move anyone in the "advanced" game, is not entirely trivial. If playing with non-hobbyists, the basic rule actually is a lot easier to play. It smooths out an inconsistency (all the other tiles have to be acted on by the moving piece), and inconsistencies always create complexity. The game is more interesting with the advanced rules, but it does introduce a touch of edginess that can trip up even experienced players.

The iPad version is nice, and easy to set up :) It does make a good game for that platform, and it may in fact be easier to learn there. On the iPhone/iPod Touch it's pretty tiny, but still playable - I've enjoyed playing it solitaire on my phone in airports.

RATING: 7
Cool take on the Lost Cities card play system.  I absolutely hated Keltis and Lost Cities: TBG, but this is much different.  It simply uses the card play system as a means to do other stuff, where how many you play of each color has no bearing on your score.  I wouldn't say you're guaranteed to like this if you like other Keltis games, as the method of card play (low to high or high to low) is really the only mechanic that matches up all that much.

It seems that there are a lot of options here, with careful planning needed to get the stuff you want.  There is also a bit of a time pressure aspect, as certain tiles (gems which are scored at game end) are taken by the player that lands there, so you'll want to beat players to those locations.

Overall, a good, casual, light game that'll still be fun for gamers.

This is the most complex game of the Lost Cities bunch.  I expect that gamers will enjoy it more than the others.  Every game leads to a lot of interesting and difficult decisions.  I especially like how the variable set up significantly changes the game play.  This gives the game a lot of replayability.  

On the down side (for me), Keltis: Das Orakel is quite abstract.  This makes it difficult for new players to remember the rules.  It is also very puzzle like, which means players prone to AP could get stuck going through all of their options.

All in all, it is quite good, but not my favorite for it's level of complexity.

As a side note, the iPhone version of this game is not very good.  It is definitely NOT worth the $9.99 price tag when compared to other iPhone apps that you can get for half the price (like the Ingenious app).

RATING: 8
Players are trying to score points by melding cards and moving their pawns along a stone path spiral.  Next in the Keltis series of games.  A lot is familiar here if you play Keltis.  Meld cards in up to five colours to advance pawns.  You only have three pawns here, moving inwards along a spiral stone path, and you jump to the colour of the card you play.  Your end of game score increases as you advance, but there are tons of bonus points to be had along the way - Priestess points, visiting the Leprechauns, and the trusty old wishing stones (now with mirrors!).  Familiar, but different.  Quite thinky as you set up a move several turns out, and the power to move backwards is a nice touch.  Nice game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game takes most of Lost Cities and makes it an underlying mechanism of a more involved game.  It's like instead of rolling a die to move your pawn, you play a game of Lost Cities instead.  There's a lot of interesting things going on at once here, but not too many.  It still manages to give me that same "I don't want to play this card right now" pain of Lost Cities that I love/hate so much with that game.  I like it!

Kellemes kis játék, Gyors, de gondolkodós, kiváló le és bevezető játék. Sajna csak max 4 személynek. Én bennem a Genial élmény jött elő, azt szeretem ennyire, annak a stílusa, hangulata jött elő. Még ha a 2 játéknak semmi köze egymáshoz, csak a tervezője ugyanaz. Amúgy a Keltis vonulatnak megfelelően kártyákat kell alul-felül csökkentve-növelve szín-szám sorba rakni, és a színnek megfelelő első helyre lehet/kell lépni egy bábuval. 3 bábu. Visszalépés, előrelépés, és Orákulom mozgatása, valamint a kövek gyűjtése ami még játszik. Szimpatikus. Akár még beszerzésre is megfontolandó.

More complex and more challenging than Keltis but certainly more engaging. There are more decision points to consider in the game, like which special powers to activate, positioning the pieces on the board to maximise the value of the tiles etc. Like this a lot more than Keltis, for sure.

You are a traveller in the Irish forest making your way along a winding [spiral] path. On the way you meet friendly leprechauns who will give you bonus points if you party with all of them; and you can also summon a mysterious lady to you who will also give you bonus points. You can earn points in a variety of ways in this game - collecting wishing stones (and multiplier magic mirrors), leprechaun bonus, oracle bonus, at certain stops along the path, and the further you move your pawns along the path, they will also score points...but be careful...if you don't move them far enough along they will score negative points!

This is a really fun game, with unique movement mechanisms (advancing clovers and reversing spirals), that has easy rules that can be explained simply. You can play the basic game to start, with only advancing the pawn that lands on a particular stone, but we now only play with the advanced rules where when a pawn lands on a stone you can advance any other pawn. This leads to some really cool combos - advance, advance, spiral back, pick up a stone, BOOM! This game has lots of replayability because the tiles have variable placement, and you always have decisions to make depending on the cards you have in hand. Sometimes you can take your time along the path, picking up stones and moving the lady; but sometimes it's a real race game where you're desperate to end the game before your opponent can score big. A solid favourite, and definitely...

Caleb described it best: Lost Cities meets Candy Land. The only flaw I see is with the Oracle herself: she rarely, if ever, finds herself used. Remove her from the game and nobody would notice. That's a good thing though--it doesn't detract from the game.

This is a sequel game to Keltis,  The components are beautiful and the game has good re playability and strategy.  Fans of Lost Cities will learn it quickly and will probably enjoy it very much.

Wow!  Takes everything we love about Keltis and Lost Cities and ruins it.

Turn after turn of players ditching cards because everyone is stuck on the same colours.  Where is the incentive to attempt to move a second piece? 
How do you stop the lead player swallowing up all the wishing stones if they keep moving the same piece?

Give me vanilla Keltis any day.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The Oracle is a more tactical, and also more flexible, version of Keltis. It's easier to go without cards of a particular suit (and, in fact, depending on how the special tiles get distributed at the beginning of the game, it might even be preferable to let certain suits languish mostly unused), the bonus tiles can significantly change the game, and it actually adds scoring opportunities beyond just moving your pieces forward on the track.

All of these are changes for the positive, but at the end of the day it's still basically the same old Keltis and they are not significant enough to warrant a rating increase.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Initial impression is high.  Possibly the best of the Keltis trilogy.  Many scoring possibilities, and varied strategies to go along with the familiar game play.  

If you stow away the cards from the original Keltis set (and just use the das Orakel cards), all three games will fit in the box for Neue Wege,Neue Ziele

UPDATE:  This game is brilliant.  The varying board set-up changes strategies each play.  The oracle, the leprechauns, the wishing stones and mirrors, provide a variety of ways to earn points.  The movement system is much more streamlined and elegant than in previous incarnations.  It also allows for stronger hand management, so it isn't as susceptible to card draw luck.
All in all a wonderful design only knizia could do.

RATING: 8.6
Das Orakel is the final evolution of the "Lost Cities" concept and an intense gaming experience. There are many different ways of scoring victory points here: vp tiles (up to 4 vps), the oracle priestess, the wishing stones and mirrors, the points of the board fields. Add the possibility of moving forward and backward through the clover and spiral tiles and to discard cards with the leprechauns and you get a very clever game. Visually speaking Das Orakel preserves rhe beautiful greenish style of the Keltis series. It scales well from 2 to 4, it's easy to play, quick to setup and fun for all. Highly recommended! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
What a beautiful board! All that green! There are red-head leprechaun cardboard chits to add theme and the oracle figure is made of a nice sturdy resin. It's more of less a race game with some leapfrogging forwards and backwards to grab points. With 2 players at least, the leader has an advantage because the player farthest ahead gets first dibs. I'm not sure if more players would fix this runaway leader problem or just make more people fall helplessly behind.

Much better than Keltis, which seems to almost play itself. Players have more control in Keltis Das Orakel, and are not as dependent on drawing the right cards. It's more about analyzing the board and executing advantageous sequences of moves. The intertwined scoring goals are more complex here, adding some subtlety to a game (Keltis) that was too transparent and calculable for my tastes.

Another very fine variant of a great game: here you can play any card to move any pawn, so the decision are at the same time easier (no risk to stay stuck) and much more difficult (each played card could be used for 4 things: move one of the 3 pawns or the Oracle). 

Interesting additional scoring elements (Kobolds, Oracle, Mirrors).
May be much more ‘gamer’ oriented as the basic game (like the expansion already was).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Watching the evolution of Lost Cities from a card game, to a board game, to this is like watching a genius at work... probably because that's exactly what's happening. The same elementary mechanics produce radically different feels. This one feels wide open and initially a little bit intimidating as a result, but soon you start to see the board's possibilities open up and you relish romping around the board. I'm not 100% sold on the eponymous oracle yet, but I have so much faith in the good doctor that I'm sure I'll see her value.

Egy parti. Tetszik. Keltishez képest csak pozitívumok:
- mozgatott figuráim nem kötődnek színhez, így nincs indított mégis bukott szín, ami azért rákfenéje volt az eredetinek,
- lapeldobás: kéz pörgetése ill. lapnak helykészítés,
- extra pontlehetőségek: orákulum, manók, "tükör",
- visszalépés.
Ennek léte mellett nehéz lenne újra Keltis-ezni.

Another game which could easily have been a just a map and sheet of counters. Most of the gameplay and scoring is identical to the original game and it feels like the oracle meeple have been added just to validate the need for a new game box and not just an expansion.

This is the gamer's game version of Keltis.  It's less approachable than Keltis, or Keltis: Neue Wege, Neue Ziele.  At the cost of distancing itself from family games, Das Orakel use the Keltis cardplay to power a game where the board is much more important.

Az akár emelkedő, akár csökkenő sorrendben lerakott kártyák után mozgathatjuk az egyik figuránkat a
táblán. Ezekből most csak hármat kapunk, mivel a mozgatás szabályai megváltoztak. Az egyetlen csigavonalban elhelyezett köveken ugyanis a figuránk a legközelebbi olyan kőre ugrik, amilyen színű
kártyát kijátszottunk. Tehát bármilyen kártya kijátszásával bármelyik figuránkat tudjuk mozgatni. Itt azért már egyértelműen látszódik a fejlődés. A Keltisben nem volt választási lehetőség, a figura a következő kőre tudott csak lépni. Az első kiegészítőben előfordult,
hogy két lehetőség közül is választhattunk, hová szeretnénk lépni. Itt viszont minden figura 5 különböző színű kőre is léphet.

Dönthetünk úgy, hogy nem valamelyik figuránkat léptetjük, hanem a közösen irányított Orákulum bábut mozgatjuk előre annyi mezőt, amennyi a kártyán lévő orákulum-szám. Ha az Orákulum egy saját figuránk mellé
érkezik, 5 pontot kapunk érte. 
Jelölők egy része ugyanúgy pontokat ad, a lóhere plusz mozgást ad, és az alapjátéknak megfelelően pontozott
köveket is gyűjthetünk. Újdonság a begyűjthető tükrök, amelyek megduplázzák a megszerzett kövekért kapott pontszámot. (Vigyázat! A negatív számokat is!)
Szintén újdonság a koboldjelölők, amelyek egyrészt kártyadobóként működnek (választhatunk, hogy kézből dobunk vagy valamelyik oszlop legutolsó kártyáját dobjuk el), másrészt ha mindhárom figuránk koboldlapkán van, akkor a játékban egyetlenegyszer kérhetünk pontozást.

With two players it's an ok variation on Keltis but I'm not completely convinced that it is worth owning although this is supposed to be a gamer's version of Keltis.

An interesting variation on the original Keltis mechanics.  Not as good as the last expansion, which really opened up a lot of choices, but still much better than the base game.  I like how in Neue Wege you can change paths.  I suppose that you can do the same thing here, but being on a singular path the opportunities for skipping multiple stones (feels like Gulo Gulo) is cool, and I would like to explore the leprechaun strategy more.  The oracle seems to be a cool element to use as long as it's not also helping everyone else.  Like the other Keltis games, getting wishing stones is important and more difficult to do here.

It seems like Oracle is all about multiple scoring opportunities, theoretically opening up a bunch of different strategies (leprechauns, oracle domination, wishing stones with mirrors, just good old standard point collection).  So I'm curious to see how different games will play out, since the potential seems really great.

We play Keltis a lot, usually with the Neue Wege expansion. Das Orakel has lots of nice ideas, but after a couple of plays, it is clear that this board is meant for at least three players. With two, you just have to sacrifice too many cards to move the Oracle figure and the game always ends in waiting for the a player to reach the end zone with their second pawn, which is a bit anti-climactic.

In short: great board for more players, but with two, we'll stick to Neue Wege.

Don't get me wrong, I appreciate that it is trying to make Keltis "heavier." The problem is that Keltis should not be a heavy game. Like Lost Cities, it is a light filler, and nothing more. In trying to make this version meatier, Knizia has stripped the game of its simplicity, which I believe is its greatest strength. The resulting complexity forces me to choose between this and other light-medium titles like Stone Age or Kingsburg. In that case, the latter two will win more often that not.

Very clever and interesting change to the Keltis game.  Many different point scoring opportunities make this a whirling dervish of a game.  Interesting and a lot of fun. I love the leprechauns and the Oracle mechanics.

I thought Neue Wege was the pinnacle of the Keltis evolutionary sequence until I played Das Orakel. This is utterly superb. Every decision is meaningful. There are many paths to victory. The game scales wonderfully and is terrific with 2. It is colorful, variable, strategic, tactical, and great fun to play. Who knew that Lost Cities could become this!!!

I own the iPad app and started playing it once the tutorial was added.  The random arrangement of specials on the path makes for considerably different calculations every game and lots of replay potential.  Unfortunately the AI is still weak.

Nagyon örültem, mikor sikerült beszereznem, a Lost Cities/Keltis család minden tagja tetszett. Sajnos nem aratott nagy sikert a családom körében ez a verzió. :( Kár, nagyon szívesen játszanák még vele.

RATING: N/A
A standalone Keltis variant in which all players move along a single track, intensifying the feeling of a race for bonuses and enabling more creative play. The game encourages slightly longer-term planning than its predecessors, which makes it more of a gamer's game, even though the rules are still simple.

How many different ways can Lost Cities: the Board Game be played? This version lends a Cartagena-esque twist to the proceedings, but I'm not sure I'm as taken with the addition of leprechauns, nor the single-trackedness. So I'm rating this one a full point lower than LC:tBG and the other Keltis that I played. Still a high rating though.

RATING: 8
It is far better than the base game, more thinking needed and a bit slower, but still fast. The addition of the oracle is an ingenious way to slow down the advancement of the meeples. Nice blend of strategy and tactics. On the other hand, the luck of the draw is still there...

Das Orakel deserves being considered the pinnacle of the whole Keltis saga: the basic principle of building ascending/descending sequences of cards is used as a starting point for a lively race game in which players spiral towards the centre of the board trying to use all means possible to score points on the way: the closer to the centre they are at the end, the more points they get, but landing on certain tiles during the game score extra, coinciding with a strange witch does it as well, standing on special leprechaun tiles can give a one-time boost and collecting special stones brings yet more yield at the end of the game.

On the first look, Knizia might have just thrown a handful of his tried and tested mechanics here, but Keltis - Das Orakel doesn't feel at all like a rehash of earlier games. Everything blends perfectly into a water-tight tactical game with enough possibilities to bypass bad draws without any trouble, that scales perfectly from two to four players and that can be enjoyed over and over without feeling repetitive; its free setup helps greatly in that respect.

This is another board game based upon the cardplay mechanics of Lost Cities.  Here, you can go high to low in addition to low to high.  The board play element is like Candyland or Cartagena: you can play a card of a given suit to advance one of your tokens to the next spot showing that symbol.  There are a couple of extra bells and whistles, but that's the gist of it.  It's really simple, but not particularly interesting.

Expands on idea of Keltis (obviously);  Continue playing increasing/decreasing cards of a suit to move piece to next spot of same color & then reap reward.  Not as simple & hence not as charming as Keltis.  However, it's not a bad game either...

Talvez não tenha jogado como devia, pois dizem-se maravilhas deste híbrido do já clássico de Reiner Knizia e a verdade é que pouco ou nada me agradou. Se era de esperar que acrescentasse alguma complexidade ao muito simples Keltis, ou que lhe proporcionasse uma ainda melhor jogabilidade, nada disso se revelou; antes pelo contrário, pois o jogo deixou de fazer sentido e o controlo do tabuleiro, uma das grandes bandeiras do original, perdeu-se! Um desperdício de dinheiro ao comprá-lo e de tempo ao jogá-lo!

+++Update: rating up to 9.5, after more plays. This is what Keltis should have been from the beginning. (A pity, that this one obviously cannot win the SdJ Award.) All the issues that I had with other Keltis games are resolved here. Even with two players, this is a great game.+++ 

The best Keltis game yet. More streamlined gameplay than Keltis expansion and lots of interesting decisions and competition from the start. Lots of possibilities to score, like in other top-notch Knizias.

I really was reluctant to pick up this one, after all I don't like series very much. While the Keltis expansion is very good, too, Keltis Oracle feels a bit more elegant and fluid. If you consider buying a Keltis game, pick this one.

The only Lost Cities/Keltis style game I don't absolutely love. I think it's because this feels like a more tactical, tile laying game than the others, which are more risk/reward.  The game is awfully busy and some of the rule twists don't seem worthwhile.  Rating could change upon further plays.

Very good variant of the base game. I'm always amazed how Knizia succeeds in taking a common mechanism and create an entirely different game with its own feel, dynamics and timing issueas. This is not an uninspired rehash, but a really good game in its own right. It may be even my favourite of the franchise, though I still have to play one that disappoints.

[Kosmos 2010 edition] {Adventure; set collection, drafting, risk-taking; optimal 3p}  {basic 7.5; variant 7.5} This game is more challenging than I expected.  It is a nice variant using the Keltis core mechanics.  The major difference in this game is that single spiral path for all pawns.

There are five ways to get score: position score, wishing stones, bonus tiles, oracle bonus, and Goblin scoring.  One has to balance well on each scoring path.

I may be wrong, but the pressure of getting good cards is not as tense as the basic game; i.e. players do not need to discard many cards in a game.

The production quality is good as usual; however, can they make the clover tile more color-blind friendly with the symbol?

I never played the original Keltis, but I played Lost Cities a lot. As such, I was really surprised at how much more Keltis Das Orakel has to offer. The first half of the game is kind of mellow, but during the second half you may be confronted with the decisions you made earlier. You may find yourself running out of options because you finished some card sequences to soon, or lagging behind because you did not profit sufficiently from the priestess scoring. Or maybe your fellow player is setting herself up for a big score using the gemstones and mirrors. All in all, a very solid offering from Kosmos and Herr Knizia.

I like it. There is something about Knizia's designs that strike a chord with me. His designs are always simple, stripped down, lacking theme and abstract. Yet, the tension and struggle for each move and each decision is just simply delicious. I have gone to the deep end in FFG games, but everytime I come back to a Knizia game, it reaffirms my love for his creations. This time around, Keltis: Oracle is a spinoff, in the loosest of sense, from Lost Cities. The one theme that he ports over is the ascending (or descending) order with which you can play your tablets to move your pawns. This creates multiple choices in your decision making tree. To make things complicated, Knizia has made the Oracle much more conflict-oriented and interactive with the introduction of mirrors which double your points and luck stones. These resources are limited and whomever reaches the spot first will claim the prize. This, naturally, creates a lot of tension in the game play.
I have only played the iOS version, but now will be actively seeking the board version. Kudos, Knizia! You remain one of my (if not the) favorite designers of all time.

Finally obtained a physical copy. Game is great! Has a fair balance of luck but it is just fun for me. Short and fun.

There's a lot more to track in this iteration of the game than there have been with the previous ones, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  At the very least, the choices to make each turn are increased, so that you have to decide how to best use your cards each turn.  In addition, you have to manage your hand of cards so you don't get stuck near the end of the game with nowhere to go because you maxed out your cards.  It's similar enough to Keltis to make it fun to play, but not as good as Neue Wege, Neue Ziele.  I'm still glad to own it, though.

Best of the Keltis board game series. The vanilla Keltis boardgame is an adaptation of Lost Cities but is for me a bit too bland (I like Lost Cities more than the board game). The Neue Wege board expansion ramps up the difficulty significantly and is a real challange.
But Das Orakel is the most complete game. Different paths to score points, room for setting up movement combos and time pressure (getting gems before the other player).

RATING: 7.8
a different game from Keltis and Neue wege and i like this one too. the mechanism is basically the same but with some interesting twists. It's easier to get rid of wrong cards, to play tricks and to choose among different strategies (going for wishing stones, for the oracle, for many stones in the upper levels, for the Kobold combo). I think it's perfect with younger players and no, of course it's not a masterwork, but i'll be very happy play it

Based on 1 play.  This game was just a bit too long for me.  I always felt like I was going to lose as well - it didn't turn out that bad for me and I could have won, which actually made me dislike the experience even more.  Basically 4.5 hours stretched my ability to enjoy it.  I'd much rather have played 2-3 medium length games. Having said that, I think the design is brilliant and I really like the way it works. Just too long....

Gets better and better with every game. Very heavy economic game. Reminds me more of Power Grid than anything else but without the luck of the draw of the Power Plants. The merger element is particularly novel but it's quite difficult to work out the true value of a company.

A delicious mix of mechanics with the auction and economic production that ultimately drive the core questions in the game of company valuation and merger targeting (and how to use mergers to your advantage even if you're not going to be the recipient or target). That mergers are calculated based on "share price" for lack of a better term, and can be initiated by a third party who owns neither company in question is absolutely wonderful. The game suffers in a couple of areas, mostly production implementation (which can be fixed). I find the map to be beautiful, but not very functional (especially at it's delivered 35"x16"). The cards are too tiny, and incorrect, plus the beads are fragile. There are two design choices though with the game that I find either unfortunate, or "the cost of doing business." First, the shipping calculation, hull company track ("Fix") and the limited number of included ships is kludgey and fiddly. We've resorted to using small dice that are color coded to eliminate the hull company indicator all together and show the hull size and ship company, and the ship location all together in one bit. The second problem is how to handle massive operations which take forever near the end of the game and really drag. The game would improve if you could shave about 45min off of it (assuming you play judiciously, upwards of 90min if you don't)... I find most of the really interesting decisions occur in era B with some on either end. The problem is era C can last upwards of 90-120 minutes due to the cumbersome operations phase at that point. It is this last point that I think is ultimately a problem; you spend time doing things that ultimately have only a passing effect on the game. If you can find ways to shorten this (e.g. have one player plan the routes while an assistant drops the coins to ensure boats are not overloaded and everyone's paid) then the game bumps up to an 8 (for the reasons noted below). It's this menial accounting that super drags on the game in it's delivered form. After 9 or 10 plays, we're efficient enough and can help assist other players that we can bang out a 4p game in 3.25 hrs which really improves the game, but the potential is always there to run longer and I find that if it drags past 4hrs, we start to rapidly lose morale.

All that said, the game makes you think for days about how to formulate strategy, and what could you have done, and what to do next time. Not many games strike me like that and this deserves praise for it. I once heard from a friend that the game is decided by the mergers (and thus the deciding question centers around leveraging/navigating them and appropriate valuation) and I think that's really true because of how they function (anything put up for merging has to merge at some cost, and you can merge any number of deeds regardless of owner based on deed quantity and you're R&D track). In terms of a problem-space and how things fall out, there are lots of really interesting questions such as "does this merger benefit me? How can I initiate a merger or drive a merger that ultimately hurts someone else, and/or benefits me? How do I decide if a merger is beneficial or hurtful in the long run?" It's this last one that is one of the most magical things about the game. While the idea of how to navigate the merger waters is always just at the tip of my tongue, I can look back and see where I should have done things differently to produce a win. Really a brilliant effort that is marred by production choices. If you're interested in obtaining a copy, I caution folks to keep in mind that to really maximize enjoyment, you'll need to look at replacing some/many/all components.

Update: 20 games in, it's made it up to a 9; I dislike era C is probably the biggest hitch, the game's end takes up a disproportionate amount of time for what value it adds (although, I did once see a person make a rather prescient decision in the final round that ultimately gave them the win when it was otherwise not going to happen).

Update2: 2 years later, I still really enjoy the game, especially with an experienced group that clips along. On the topic of hidden cash vs open, you can do open cash and it works as long as you don't sit and constantly try and math out things. Asking once a round to see who has the incentive to sit I think is one of two differences. Second, it's almost not worth doing a final OR as kingmaking is terrible on the final era C OR. It's almost easy to make a solid estimation of revenue for production companies and call the game instead. Not something I'd want to do often, but an interesting idea.

A terrific game in which early decisions lead to dimly seen, profound conclusions. A mild deficiency of the game is that players out of contention (and there will be, whether they know it or not) have plenty of power to make kings. Playing with closed money alleviates this problem at least partially.

4 players and firat time for 2 of us. Nice theme but the fiddliness of shipping in the end game is frustrating, and the mapboard... crikey! Hard to read, hard to see the boundaries and, worst of all, it's out of the atlas and not scaled for gameplay.

RATING: 7
4 plays / 3,4 players (4p = 5hours, 3p = 4.5h)

LIKE: An incredible brain melt to balance valuation of economic position, map position, and technology. Great tension in every round as turn order does not always have devestating effects (as some Splotter games do). Exhilarating to take a big risk on a big merger, and watching the balance of money shift hands. Lots of strategies, even for relative newcomers.

DISLIKE: The amount of math is considerable, but using a chart (BGG files section) helps a lot. The map can get very fiddly, crowded, and difficult to see connections. The map gets easier to understand with additional plays. It is a long game, and players can be eliminated, sadly.

OVERALL: With all the negatives, it is a brilliantly designed game with enormous strategies. Once again, Splotter has made a deep impression on me. There was one point where I saw how siap faji was a better protected resource than the other resources, and tried to leverage that. The number of possible strategies makes this game a winner, but it taxes my brain. The jumbo pieces were not terrible, we used them for marking city deliveries, but cubes would have been better.

UPDATE: Had an odd 3-player game where it dissolved into a kingmaking play during last era for one player to maintain 2nd place after a leader was determined. It was an uninteresting game for several rounds. A shame this game is more unstable at 3 players. Also, I'm starting to see similar patterns from game to game, but need to play more. (Downrated for now.)

Similar mechanisms to Imperial and Food Chain Magnate.

I played the propotype in July 2005 and was impressed. The game has many of the hallmarks of a Splotter game, but a faster time, far more player interaction and some clever systems. Top of my wish list for Essen 2005.
Subsequent plays have confirmed it as a top game with plenty of options and strategies to follow. I really like the swapping of companies and the underlying processes. One of the best games to be produced during 2005/06.

I got roped into playing this being told that "it's shorter with more people!" ... it was not. Actually, this isn't a bad game at all and it probably doesn't deserve a "3." My problem with it is that it took five of us a whopping four hours to play this game, and if it's shorter with more people, I can't imagine EVER wanting to play it again, even though the mechanics were OK and the game was kind of fun at first... but then it just dragged on waaaaaaaay too long and if I'm going to play a 3+ hour game then I damn well want it to be something I actually will enjoy for the whole 3+ hours (I didn't want to play it going in, was willing to be convinced, and basically started out from hating it, moved to kind-of liking it, then decided I hated it again). Also, the board is absolutely TERRIBLY designed, possibly the single worst one I've ever seen. Spaces were poorly designated and it made the gameplay unclear. Even the experienced players couldn't agree on where stuff went.

A very good medium strategy cum economic game. Difficult to see regions in proper on the map during the first game, but will get some familiarity after a few plays.

Simple game of goods for money, but as the tiles are not randomized, the game could stagnate to some level of similarity after more plays.

Felt that its a good alternative to monopoly.

The ergonomics are absolute garbage and detract from the game. The game itself is challenging and unforgiving -- not intrinsically bad, but it does mean players must be around the same experience level. At times it felt like work, not a game, but I can see how the game can appeal to those looking for something heavier.

Yet again, a Splotter game has impressed me with its fascinating use of spatial reasoning on the board. Indonesia is a good economic game as such. Nevertheless, a few things hold me back from loving it. For one thing, the obnoxious amount of calculations needed to operate late in the game is annoying. Plus, the bits don't really match the board. The pieces cover and clutter up already hard to see lines confusing operations even further.

Finally, the business game outside the board is interesting,  but funky. I either want more or less control available in owning/merging companies and I'm not sure which. The design philosophy here seems to be less is more, but the resulting dynamics still throw me a bit.

A fine, heavy game of mergers, acquisitions and shipping.  Although it is a long game it keeps players engaged with lots of decision-making and a good level of interaction.  After three plays the strategy remains opaque to me, which is probably a good thing.  My one real gripe is that during mergers, judging the values of companies is critical, yet there are so many variables that calculations can be mind-boggling.

RATING: 5
This is a LONG game with LOTS of mathematical calculations.  In fact, I think the third edition of "Indonesia" should ship with a subtitle (in keeping with the typography chosen for the game board, the subtitle can be in an indecipherable cursive font):  "Indonesia: A Four Hour Game With Lots of Mathematical Calculations." 

Sound intriguing? Wanna play?  For FOUR hours?!!!  Think of Indonesia as a four hour final exam on the subject of multiplication and division.  Imagine sitting for a four hour final exam on "Math" in the third grade of elementary school.  Wanna do it?  No thanks?  Correct answer! 

Indonesia is an example of a game with many good, clever design ideas that is, nevertheless, a hot mess.  It has very conspicuous run away leader and king making problems, and this, in a four hour game!  

On the plus side, as cube delivery games go (think of the brilliance of the cube delivery game "Steam" for example) this cube delivery game has some interesting ideas (for example, cities and industries grow for free only if they are fully satisfied or fully utilized).  

The merger mechanic in this game feels clever, in an Imperial 2030 sort of way, along the lines of:  wow, I thought that company (or country in Imperial 2030) was mine, and now you have it...hey wait, what just happened? Maddening, but interesting.  

Yet, by about the second or third merger in the game, it becomes clear that ALL merger decisions MUST be rigorously mathematically calculated by players  in order to be properly "played" by players.  Give me 3 minutes here fellow players, so I can do all the math in my head.  We can't give you three minutes!  We will give you 30 seconds.  Can't do the math quickly?  You are going to lose the game!  Is this fun?  For perhaps a half an hour, but for four hours?

I liked the thematic setting of Indonesia.  I enjoyed immersing myself in Indonesia, and really wanted to enjoy playing something within this area of the world, but alas, the graphics on the map (and components) in Indonesia are some of the worst I have seen in a commercially published game.  Most memorably, who chose that unreadable cursive font for the map?!  And this is on the SECOND edition?!  

Bottom line:  Indonesia has deeply memorable problems that when playing the game, one is forced to spend four hours "experiencing" with friends.  Hey, can we wash the cat instead? Hmmmm...tough call:   play Indonesia....or lots of hissing and scratch wounds.

Im Grunde ein schönes Spiel, wenn man Wirtschaftsspiele mag. Am Ende wurde mir aber der Verwaltungsaufwand beim Verschiffen der Güter schon zu groß. Da dauern die Züge der Mitspieler ewig und es macht eigentlich auch kaum Spaß dabei zu zusehen. Ein guter Mechanismus, der sich in der Praxis leider ziemlich inelegant spielt. Das Fusionieren der Firmen ist schwierig einzuschätzen, weil man grob abschätzen muss, wie viel es einem wirklich bringt. Bis Era B hat es mir sehr gut gefallen, dann ist die Spannung extrem abgefallen, weil einfach das Verschiffen immer so ewig gedauert hat und man immer schauen muss, wie die Hülle ist und welche Bote man benutzt usw.

A wonderful game of being in the right place at the right time.  I really like the way competition in the various resources drives players out of commodities that were once highly profitable.  The tension between spending to own the right things and maintaining a sufficient cash reserve to protect the things you already have is one of the high-points of the game.  Plays in 2 hours with fast players, at least some of which are trying to drive the game to an end (and someone should be), or four hours with players who do not or will not do so.

My comments should be taken with a grain of salt: I seem unable to win at this game.  I appear to have some sort of flaw that consigns me to the back of the pack every time I play this (I suspect that it is valuing "my" companies too highly).

With one 4-person play under our belts, it is ratable. The game is so overly long that you can really discuss and consider how the mechanics are working, or not. We did have a great time playing the game. It somehow manages to work despite the uneven components. Indonesia is a great game with a couple of imperfect mechanics (bid for start position, purchase of own merged companies), but flawed greatly by some poor component graphics, and an inconsistent look when a particular look was obviously carefully considered. I expect I will play it again and I will revise this rating should that playing warrant it. However, given the length and fiddliness, we don%u2019t expect to play again until summer, at the earliest.

Ez a játék még a Die Machernél is szűkebb réteget érint szerintem, annak ellenére, hogy a kereskedés téma populárisabb, mint a politika.
Kezdem mindjárt azzal, hogy bár a szabályrendszert nem tartom kiugróan bonyolultnak (Macher vagy TTA szabálya jóval bonyolultabb), de ahhoz, hogy akár csak nagyjából előre lássuk, hogy mi történik a forduló végéig, szerintem nagyon komplex gondolkodásmód szükséges, és ezáltal bele van kódolva a játékba az AP veszély.
A fejlesztések nagyon ötletesen vannak megoldva, és elősegítik azt, hogy a játéknak előbb-utóbb azért vége legyen:)) (így se rövid). A legötletesebb a licitet befolyásoló 5-ös, 25-ös stb. szorzó. A bank is szellemesen van megoldva (nem használhatod a licitre beadott pénzt, de továbbra is a tiéd marad).
Az összeolvadások menete szintén egyedi csavar, az utolsó kör dupla értéke pedig teljesen más stratégiát igényel(het), mint a korábbi fordulók, erősen díjazza a játék a feljövőben lévőket. A szállítás pedig ügyes kiegyenlítő mechanizmus (lehet).
Hallottam kritikákat a területhatárok kuszaságáról, de nekem nem volt gondom a grafikával.
A segédlet néhány során és a fejlesztések nevein kívül nincs szöveg a játékelemeken, kvázi nyelvfüggetlen játék (Már ha a szabályt nem számítjuk nyelvfüggőnek:))).
Aki szereti a kemény, agyalós játékokat, annak kötelező kipróbálnia, igazi hardcore gazdasági, pénzmaximalizálós játék, nagy újrajátszhatósági faktorral.
Ha jók az információim, jelenleg összesen 3 példány van Magyarországon, igazi ritkaságról van szó. Köszönet, hogy kipróbálhattam.

First Game: 14 Oct. 2007
I finally played the game and it started on a sour note.  We were all confused and I didn't prep myself as much as I should have to teach the game for the very first time.  By the end of the game though (4 hours), things were starting to click and everyone was enjoying themselves.  The game is certainly deep and heavy.  I like that a lot.  It is so deep that I was actually drowning in choices.  A lot of things were subtle and we couldn't figure out what the optimal move was.  The biggest complaint that I have is the map.  Splotter made a huge error by going for aesthetics instead of function.  The market for this game doesn't care as much how the game looks like as much as they do about functionality.  For such a fiddly game they really should have made the map more user friendly.  So much time is wasted trying to figure out what is where and what connects to what.  If I could do it again, I wouldn't purchase the game because it is way too expensive for how bad the map is.  Yes, it is that bad.  The map is enough to completely turn me off on the game.  Now, I am hoping Mike Chapel will release his Indonesia map project and can enjoy the game a lot more.  I like the game quite a bit but the map is just horrendous.  

After re-reading the rules and perusing the forums I found a lot of rule mistakes that are significant.  
1) We never cleared the cities unless it grew.  SO you can imagine that there is a lot less money in the game.
2) We limited the number of companies one can have during the acquisition phase even though they had enough slots to get more.  This certainly slowed the game a bit, but not that much.
3) We forgot about the rule that you can give up your R&D to increase another players Hull Player (hull size).
4) We didn't alternate running one company at the time between players.  We let one player to run all of their companies, which gave the first player a huge advantage.  They could fill up all the cities before anyone can.  

Even with all of these rule mistakes, I still enjoyed the game.

First 2 plays since Oct-2007.  Wow!  It's been more than a year since I played this game.  The main reason that I finally pushed for this game is because I finally successfully found a way to not use the production goods chits and cities that came with the game.  The chits and cities that came with the game are just horrible to use on the map because they cover important division lines between provinces and areas in provinces.  I used beads that are a quarter of the foot print of the chits and wooden pieces a quarter than the city glass tokens.  With these everything can easily be seen and the board is not cluttered with oversized chits.

With all the production issues aside, this is a great game.  This is one of the deepest games that I have.  Every little move has so much repercussions and how they turn the game upside down and back.  Winning a merger might be great, but you just gave someone else tons of money that would be able to merge your other companies or buy the just merged company back.  The fact that mergers are valued differently from player to player because the pay out is different because of uneven numbers production goods from each company is another layer that one can explore.  I love that the R&D is there because it provides different abilities for each player depending on what strategy they are following.  It is also surprisingly how well the game handles 2 players, although it is longer than if you had more players. I find it admirable that changing the locations of cities within each province from game to game changes the game dramatically.  By that simple change so much variability is infused into the game.  This game is just brain-burning goodness!  Without my modifications of the game pieces this would only rate 8 as I wouldn't want to play it as much.  However, with my modifications this is a 9.5.  Almost a 10, but it has some fiddly parts that keeps it from making it.

Excellent! a bit of brass, a bit of steam, an economic game of medium complexity that rewards the time invested in it. In terms of how easy time passes while playing, I compare it to through the ages! it is an excellent economic game that does not burn your mind, yet it provides a full developing network building - resource producing - stock handling experience. Recommended!

Indonesia is more complex and mathy than my usual fare.  Am I able to assign the appropriate values to turn order bids & mergers?  Nope, not even close.  
Do I consistently choose the worst possible research & development option?  Yes, I almost always second guess myself.  During my last session, I actually pleaded with the other players to allow me to take back one of my moves.  I'd rather not be that guy.

Ok, so the game is grossly over priced and no one should buy it out of principle. Nonetheless it is actually a good financial game of creating profitable companies that either grow or transport goods, merging them when necessary to increase your profits or reduce those of your opponents. I'm looking forward to more plays.

This is a really good game, but I would certainly try before you buy. Aspects you may not like: duration, prone to AP, fiddlyness.

Just try it out at some convention and you'll know whether it's your type of game.

Played once, 5 player. A physically beautiful game from Splotter, it is about economic development, mergers and acquisitions in an area of the world not often covered by games. The game is quite long, though with experience i am sure it could be shortened. I felt that an early poor choice (not understanding the entire flow yet) left me out to dry, but in truth, switching strategies brought me much of the way back. A good sign in a longer game. Game took a little over 4 hours.

First Play: Needs one play to really understand, however do refer to Boardgames with Scott for an excellent 30 min explanation and overview. 

The structure and mechanism is 1st rate, the opportunities seem very wide and player interaction full on with lots of screwage potential.

Downsides, the art work for the board although very arty and attractive, is very unclear and indistinct in many place. The glare of artificial lights can white out borders and boundaries. On 2 occassions I tried to make a move incorrectly, having not seen a faint boundary line. On top of that, the land areas are tiny and prone to be fiddly when placing tiles and pieces. Whereas the oceans which only ever need a tiny boat or two are huge. Screw geographical accuracy, lets try to be a bit topographical for game expediency in future. If I were to buy this game, I think I'd have to produce a new board, which is a chunky reason not to buy, which is a shame.

But hey, I bought it.

Brian and I had a 2 player learning game of this Sunday night. He won, but it was super close, within about $100. First things first, I would NEVER play this with more than 3 as I think the AP would be too problematic. Our game took just over 4 hours and neither of us really have AP too bad. About the 2nd edition component issue, yes the wooden pieces are too big. But, that really doesn't affect game play. We just stood them up in their provinces and we never had a problem. The whole placing of cities, companies, and goods is absolutely crucial to success in this game. I love games where there is a spatial element mixed into other mechanisms (much like FCM, actually) and this one has it in spades. Also, when to Merger is soooo important. If you do it too early, you will lose money as you can't restock your newly merged company until it is completely cleared out. Merge too late and you can have another player delivering goods to cities you were hoping to because they researched Turn Order while you were doing other stuff. The Splotter games are quickly becoming some of my favorite games ever. TGZ is next on the Splotter to play list. I really, REALLY need to find Antiquity and Greed Incorporated for sale or trade at some point. Anybody interested?

rated after one play, five player. Despite comments to the contrary the game zipped by - (3 hours, including rules explanation, child-bedding and pizza munching (although I think it is one of those rare games where the game is faster with more players). Enjoyable and challenging and I did not feel that there was much downtime. It is fiddly, however, and the board is difficult to read. Would play it again although I suspect four would be better, just to allow a few more longer-term strategies to develop.

One playing with three.  An interesting game with fairly constant tension and calculation throughout.  The last round doubling is a somewhat jarring end to the game.  Definitely on the "would like to play this again" list, not quite as strong IMO as Antiquity or Roads & Boats.

I don't care for this game, though some members of my group love it.  I found it dull, unengaging, with a highly uninteresting theme.  Production values are average, though the board is pretty ugly.  The business simulation, area control, and techology upgrade aspects of this game were well done, but in the end I just couldn't get excited about rice farming and microwave meal production in Indonesia.

Very cool game.  The last turn or three can get bogged down (and take > 1/2 hour each), but aside from this the flow of the game is very smooth and enjoyable.  The slower turns are worth it, and, I suspect, indicative of lack of knowledge of optimal playing choices.

I really enjoy Indonesia, but it just takes so long and gets so bogged down at the end.  I think I'll probably try to play through phase B for a few games until the game is more familiar territory, and slightly faster.  Once every 6 months doesn't really cut it for accomplishing this.

9-4-09

Got in a 3-player tonight.  It's been a while, and while the game takes longer and everyone has more to individually take care of, the development is still wonderful.  It's a pity this game hits the table so rarely - I also think that more 18xx play has helped make those calculations more familiar, and faster as a result of practice.

RATING: 9
A brilliant economical, business and financial design where most money at the end wins. The rules overhead is not intimidating, but the complexity comes in your decisions as to when and what to merge, which companies to acquire and what tech to attain in the R&D track. 

Although there is little luck, unexpected things may occur due to player interaction and gameplay. The status quo is ever changing and it takes the understanding of the opaque to succeed.

Ironically, the game seems to play faster at higher player counts. Three or four seems to be the better player count. At five, you might not see the fruits of your labors since the ending can come abruptly. 

This is a must try for heavier gamers who want depth and difficult decisions in their games or for those interested in economical style games.

Only 5 plays of this game so far, I can tell that it is a keeper though.  I find the research and development aspect very interesting, however i have yet to play the game enough times to be able to say that I appreciate all of the potential choices it presents.  

The game map also presents many options for varied games to emerge, especially as most of my plays have been with 3 players, meaning each game has developed differently.

These two facts combined mean that this game is one that is highly replayable, not only due to the potential different ways each game can develop but also due to the fact that you want to return to the game to try a different strategy.

I came to play this game after experience of playing power grid and Agricola.

RATING: 8
Very interesting game and I'm glad I finally had the chance to try it.  The developments over the course of the game seem like they can be quite the roller coaster, especially with mergers.  It took a while, but was good fun.  The only part I didn't like was the amount of money that was split between the shippers and how the shippers had little input on that.  However, that may have been largely my fault with where I put my ships.  Had I avoided direct competition, it probably would have forced shipping over different lines.  Good game.

Second play was good and different than the first.  My rating for this game has the potential to go up, but I only feel like I kind of get it so far.  Second play finished with everyone within $150 of one another... I finished third and once again mishandled my shipping company.

In my third play, I finally saw Siap Faji come out strong early in era B and that player ran away with it (they had a merged rubber company too).  I felt like I had a good position heading into era B and fumbled it away.  I guess I should have advanced on the merger track to ensure one player didn't have that all to himself and when I had the most money, but I'm still not convinced that it would have stopped him with his Siap Faji.  Once again, I mishandled my shipping company and that was costly.  I finished last (and deserved it).

Fourth play was errorful on my part.  Other players started giving me money in shipping because I seemed so far behind.  That moved me into a second place that was totally undeserved.  I still like this game and I get it as it unfolds.  I just feel like I need to play it a few times in a week or two to really get a better feel for how it really works.  In this game, the Siap Faji player won again.

Interminably long.  If you are in the game, it will be enjoyable.  If not, however, it's insufferable.  Like most Splotters, this is not newbie friendly.  

My first experience was a 45 minute rules explanation that did not really cover how to play, followed by 1 hour of game, followed by 3.5 hours of wasting my time since I was no longer in the game.

I'm sure with repeated plays among a similar group, it'd be fun.  But I'm unlikely to bother.  Too many games these days.

FCM is an excellent distillation of this that plays in half the time.

Wow, very awesome. The shipping mechanic is easy to understand, and the merging mechanic is brilliant. I want to play more. One thing that puts this econ game over the top for me, is that all companies are owned by one person at a time. They can move around, but you are paid for them. This appeals to me sooo much more than share mechanics, where my opponent owns part of my company.

An economic game in part of the world you normally only hear about with Tsunamis and strife.  The R&D track adds a nice mechanic to the game, and isn't talked about very much.  While companies are free to start, the cost of the right R&D action can be very high.  

Fantastic game, if you don't mind a bit of fiddle, and enjoy a natural look at feel more than hexes.

First impressions: There are definitely components issues in the 2nd edition of this game. The provided wooden pieces are about 10x too big, the cardboard player ships are too dark in many cases to discern ship types and are oversized for the board. I have upgraded my copy by purchasing additional components (see below).

This game is very unique and feels highly opaque and "open". The major challenge is that players are constantly asked to value things that are difficult to value without significant experience. It has a great combination of spatial logistics to deliver goods, valuation with company auctions, and a ramping of complexity. It is vital that players strike the correct balance of keeping free cash handy, but also holding onto valuable companies. Couple this with the interesting variety from the R&D track and you have a fascinating game. I have a hard time rating this one because in many ways it seems brilliant, and in other ways it is unapproachable with component issues. 

Upgraded my copy with: 25 pink ships, 15 brown ships, 10 red ships, 10 yellow ships, 10 blue ships, 10 purple ships, 55 green 8mm cubes, 55 black 8mm cubes, 55 white 8mm cubes, 55 gray 8mm cubes, and 55 natural 8mm cubes. All from spielmaterial.de

It's a must have game for me since i found out that this complex game consists of variety kind of strategies, not in killing your oponnents like in wargames but more like building companies empire of your own. You have to build up an economy within Indonesian islands. Basic agricultural economy especially in Java island and most western part of Indonesia develops into early phase of this game while at the end you can catch up by acquiring oil company in the east, shipping companies could also be good strategy in earning money because your opponents have to transport goods into cities, and by merging companies at the right time and price you will gain more money. Yap!! that's right, it's all about money at the end, how to acquire money depend on your startegy in doing bussiness.

I dislike the turn order bidding, but love everything else!  I finally got to see Microwave Meals work out excellently in a game! I loved Even merging a company on the final round of the game worked out for me due to the double income and low shipping costs.  Even though a merger may be a great deal for you to acquire, it might leave you cash poor to defend ANOTHER merger right away.  Oh, it is a great game!  I absolutely hate the fiddly-ness of the map and the chits and calculating cash and all that, but it is a GREAT game!  It would be very nice sitting around an iPad playing (letting the computer do all the calculations!)

RATING: 8.5
A delightfully competitive multiplayer economic strategy game for three to five players. Players own and operate commodity companies or shipping companies throughout the Indonesian island chain. Companies produce and deliver commodities (rice, spices, rubber, TV dinners(?), and oil) yielding revenue to the owners of the companies and to owners of the shipping lines which must be used to transport goods to the cities which spring up through the game. The game consists of three epochs/eras each of which consist of several phases (bidding for turn order, proposing mergers, acquisition of new companies, R&D, and company operation) each of which may consist of several rounds. Expect games to last anywhere from three to five hours depending on the number of players and their level of experience.

The hook is the R&D track which permits players to expand the number of company deeds they can hold, the size of their ships, the speed at which their companies can expand, the value of their turn order bids, and the number of company deeds that can be a part of a proposed "merger." These mergers, how they are proposed, formed and who can bid for their ownership, form the heart of the game as the outcome of the merger activity will have a large impact in determining the eventual winner.

As with many great games, the rules are deceptively simple - many games will be required to reveal the depth this game offers. Warning: some may find the "calculations" needed to play this game quite fiddly - reminiscent of an 18XX game, as is the absence of any randomness save the determination of the intial player turn order. But these could also be features that will attract you to it, as it did me...

RATING: 9
A good game that has some production/graphic design problems that lets it down a little bit for me.

1. Sea areas - not at all clear on the map, especially for new players or in poor light

2. Marker supply - boats, there isn't really enough boat markers forcing you to use multiple colours/shapes after a merger, not ideal and particularly annoying given the cost of the game

2a. Boat colour - totally kills the nice look of the game, the boats are bright colours unlike the player markers, board etc.

3. Cities - yes the glass beads look nice but they're not exactly useful in play :( Better IMHO to have a city with a flat surface to keep the production markers on to show which city has taken a delivery of a particular goods. Currently you have to put the markers next to the city, which isn't so great if you have cities close to each other. I guess you could stack them underneath, but then you'd only see the top one.

4. Math intensive bidding system - I can't think up an alternative though. Perhaps a play aid is needed? Anyway having to bid up in multiples of numbers is a problem for some players - as is working out the final division of the merger (4/9 - 5/9 etc)

But despite the negatives, it's an economic game that I enjoy playing.

*** Update - played this some more and the rating has improved. Actually works as a 2 player, I had my doubts, although it's certainly different from multiplayer, turn order is even more critical, especially if you're both into the same commodities (gotta ship first). Bidding is still a bit of a pain for those with poor mental arithmetic (use a calculator), marking the deliveries doesn't seem so bad now - but the boat mix is still the biggest downside (and that's a very minor complaint).

A game of economics with shades of T&E and Acquire as big empires can come and bully the smaller ones. Potentially vicious and nasty. Excellent player interaction. Long (4-5 hours) but gripping every minute of the game.

Fantastic!

PS The English rules are not detailed enough. I found it difficult to prep the game from scratch using just the printed rules. Watch Scott's video for help.

Update, after 4 plays (3,4,5ers), the brilliance of the game is still there. The game plays differently every time because of city placement and company/shipping line growth. The verdict is out as to whether 3er is a good number as players tend to use their own shipping lines. The other interesting note is that Indonesia is one of the rare games where the 3 player game is longer to play than the 5 player game.

This game is now in my top 10.

Fantastically deep and creative economics game. You leave each game with a head full of ideas for the next. Would be a 10 if not for two things:
1) The playtime is easily 3-4 hours, even with experienced players.
2) The game is fiddly in the extreme. Both physically in terms of the bits and mentally in terms of the mergers.

The first issue you just have to be willing to put up with, the second you can mitigate by printing out some merger tables and using crafty methods for tracking shipping.

Still, a fantastic, deep game and one which any economic style game fan should own.

9/6/06 - things to pay attention to :

- during mergers, if a company has been involved in a merger it cannot be involved in another merger until the next merger phase.

- during the operations phase, when a production company has completed its shipping of goods and has collected its income it can only expand for free if it has shipped everything it has produced. If it has left over goods then it can only expand by paying, per region, the cost of its income. The expansion is limited of course by the rate of expansion indicated by the research and development track.

Another meaty Splotter game.  The strategy of the game is OK, but the design is fiddly: lots of counting out distances and trying to figure out which areas are adjacent, etc.  The shipping lanes got difficult to track later in the game.  Didn't grab me.

RATING: 3
A 3 feels harsh, but that's the level at which I "would not play again", so there you go. This is a game with a lot of stuff going on, none of which seems to quite work. It's also rather overwrought. The whole tactical game of building shipping lines and plantations and moving goods to market is detailed and very fiddly for little purpose; it could have been done abstractly and simply with no loss. But then it would be apperent how little game there is here.

Indonesia is not as bad as this makes it sound. Like Roads & Boats, there is an enjoyment factor here in just pushing around the pieces and interacting with the game. But you could say this about a lot of games.

Great game of expanding/merging businesses right up until the last few turns, where the game bogs down incredibly and downtime gets a little out of hand.  Other than than, lots of cool things going on!  I especially like the advancement track, which is where players choose their strategy for the game.  Depending on which track each player advances, players can really take different strategies toward winning.

Pros:
Challenging and fascinating sway of market dynamics , the mergers that manage to benefit all players in some way, and tough R&D decisions 
Players can win with a variety of strategies: focusing on mostly shipping, or mostly production

Cons:
Board and component issues
The accounting can be a bit cumbersome

First of all, you have to be focused to get this game done in 4 hours.  A 4 player game took my group 6 hours.  Secondly, the board is not good for the components, which also should be better.  Why not 6 different color ships for that many different businesses so as to not be confused?  The provinces are too small, so you spend a large portion of your time figuring out where things belong.  It makes A&A look like a great game for space management.  With that said, 90% of the mechanics are fantastic.  It reminds me of Acquire and Power Grid.  Very good economic game.  The only thing that doesn't work is the turn order bidding.  The Price is Right auction is downright painful, and something better could have been used in its place.  I will never play this one again because it takes way too damn long, but I reward it for its ingenuity.

A long game and rather fiddly with difficult to read region lines on the map and confusion when working out how to ship goods via ships with more than 1 hull space. The auctions were quite awkward, too, with increments in various times tables. This must be one of the few games I know that really does require a calculator or at least a good grasp of arithmetic. I did like the mergers though valuing companies can be really hard and the Research & Development phase which offers some really tough choices. The inclusion of 'microwave meals' as a commodity made the exotic theme vanish for me.

This is a good game, BUT it is fiddly, fiddly, fiddly to play.  The board and the company deeds are impossible to read at any distance, and the game is full of pieces that don't fit on the spaces they need to go on.  Our group of 5 thought it added about an hour to the game to flip little chits.  The board spaces are poorly marked.  It really decreased our enjoyment.  I understand that the underlying game is good, though, like other Splotter games, if you get hosed on the first turn, you are already at a significant disadvantage.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Rating based on a 5-player experience, and could possibly go up if played with 3 or 4 players.  With 5, the downtime is killer during the operations phase. It felt like stuff was just happening, which in turn makes the decisions not feel all that meaningful, instead, just a way to randomized the game. I mean, I have no idea if Slots-3 or Mergers-3 is my best move at that time, so I just pick one and see what happens and go from there.  The only really meaty decisions are just evaluating future worth of companies, but that is very hard to do with 5 players all interacting with the board.  
Also, this has got to be one of the fiddliest games I've ever played.  Top 5 in terms of Fiddly if not Number 1.

RATING: 7
Mechanics aren't very complicated, although it's best to be taught the game rather than try to learn by reading the rules.  The strategy, however, is quite deep, an there is a lot of potential for analysis-paralysis when trying to figure out just what a merger is worth.

RATING: 8
This is a very heavy economic game. It is fiddly like the other Splotter games that I have played but I don't mind that as the play length is reasonable at 3 hours. The assessing the value of companies on the fly makes for interesting games. You have to estimate how much a company can make you and how many turns remain in the game to make money. The merging of companies is done so well. 

It is rough on players who fall behind though. Not sure it would hit the table enough to warrant buying it but it is tempting as I can't think of a more challenging economic game.

RATING: 8
The interaction of multiple players working together for unevenly shared revenue is facniating. As are the mergers and aquisitions. However ultimately I found the math made my head hurt and not in a good way. It was like taking a calculus test. Still, it is a rich game, with heaps of character and for the right person this game should be a prize jewel in the collection.

A contender for the highest density of acheingly difficlt decisions.  Utterly unlike and yet remarkably similar to 18XX games (perhaps not surprising given that it is a perfect and compleat information finance game).  

Unfortunately games with experienced players seem to grow increasingly long, and not by a small factor.  The last three rounds in particular take almost a third of the game time and deliver miniscule game-value.

I'm finding I'm a sucker for these sorts of economic planning games.  This one is very strong and I enjoy it a great deal.  There is plenty to think about and it blends strategy and tactics very well.  It's long, but it's more manageable for a game night than something like Roads & Boats, and I think it scales better for different numbers of players than that game as well.  This game is very different from the other Splotter faire, having more in common with perhaps Imperial and Age of Steam than any of those.  The stock and route elements are different than 18xx, although I could see fans of 18xx liking this one.

RATING: 9
[UPDATE 2/16]: I think I ended up underestimating this game. I think you get a rough idea of who's winning after ten or so bites of the apple. (The game is still pretty friggin' opaque, but still.) I'm still not crazy about the endgame grind of math, but overall it's pretty amazing.

:tobacco: :( :) :D :D :D Like Chicago Express, Indonesia is a game won or lost in the auctions, with the play on the board being ... well, not window dressing per se, but definitely of ancillary importance. Does a nice job of introducing a "coop-etition" aspect a la Brass. And it's viciously brutally directly confrontational in a way that few games are, including games about shooting your opponents in the face. There are enough enjoyable and elegant mechanisms in Indonesia's toolbox that the places where the game falls down on the job are just damned disappointing.

And yet they're there: the late operating rounds' revenue calculations are even more of a pain in the butt than 18xx games, the graphic design leaves a lot to be desired (both in terms of function and aesthetics), and the general physical presentation of the game, while it wouldn't be a deal breaker in your run of the mill title, is distractingly mediocre in a game that costs upwards of 80 bones. I'm aware of the argument that a niche publisher producing niche titles for a niche audience in small batches shouldn't be held to the same standards. I just think this argument is bunk. Indonesia is no more obscure or esoteric, rules-wise, than Age of Steam, Chicago Express, Brass, or plenty of titles from GMT, all of which look and feel more substantial and cost significantly less. Grumble ^ 3.

All of this makes me sound like I'm slamming a game I actually like quite a bit. Let me make amends: this really is a very good game. But the hype (and truth be told, the price tag, even after I bought it second hand) led me to expect The Ultimate Multi-Player Zero-Luck Economic Game, and it's not. It's damn clever, it's highly playable, and I suspect it will be quite some time before I even feel like I have a substantive grasp on its subtleties. But when you expect the Holy Grail and end up with high-end stemware, a bit of remorse is to be expected, rational or otherwise.

The party line on this game is that it's an 18xx and not an 18xx, and I see where everyone's coming from.  Mechanically this game does not have too much in common with the 18xx series, but it scratches a similar itch.

The heart of Indonesia is in its Mergers phase, just as the real interest of 18xx titles lies in its stock rounds.  Mergers are when we see hostile takeovers, deliberate draining of pponents' bank accounts just so the 'real' target can be grabbed up on the cheap, the occasional conglomerate forming out of two of a person's own companies just so he can surprise everyone with room to bid on that next company Lauren thought she had in the bag, and so on.  Very different things going on, but what I just described should sound familiar on a gut level to anyone who's played an 18xx.

The ORs are about as interesting in Indonesia as in an 18xx--kinda.  They're fun, and it's great when you get to run a route you thought impossible, or when you can completely shut out an opponent from delivering anything on his next OR.  Sometimes you will have a great choice between making more money and screwing nobody, or making less money, giving some to somebody else, and devestating somebody else's next play.

The value of being at various points in the turn order is wonderfully fluid, and each turn's bidding for order is a great abstraction of 18xx's stock price and priority card manipulations.

Everyone's right about the boats, they're terrible.

This is a relatively short game multiplayer and a long game two-player.  Based on the physical limitations of each player's company holdings and the game-ending condition that all companies need to be sold to end the game, we're looking at two things in the two-player version: lots of huge mergers and lots of turns.  The bigger the company, the longer it takes to calculate a route.  By the last turn or two of our game, when it was one company's turn to operate, it was the other player's turn to go smoke a cigarette.  I am not exaggerating.  However, we loved it, and it's possible our experience was atypical.

Multiplayer requires either the participation of the Rain Man or an Excel spreadsheet which tells players involved in mergers how to bid and what the payouts will look like to all interested parties.  It speeds things up and removes 90% of the tedium from the game.

With the spreadsheet and savvy, nasty opponents, Indonesia is a great way to scratch the 18xx itch in much less time.

Indonesia is a wonderful game.  Returning to it after an extended foray into the work of 18xx, the arithmetic and number crunching no longer bothered me, and it was much easier to appreciate the game's accomplishments.  The merger mechanism is a stroke of brilliance that is used to  stunning effect.

RATING: 9
I shied away from this game a bit because my other experience with Splotter, Roads & Boats, was fun, but in a sort of frustrating way because of the sheer fiddly factor of the bits and the way the end game could end up dragging because of it. I will say it up front: Indonesia has hardly any fiddle in comparison to R&B, and the payoff is much, much better. The only truly fiddly aspect is keeping track of boat use when the board starts to get cluttered, and I find that simply having a system and running with it helps here. I have found the "nickel on the boat as you use it" technique is the best way to go, it's simple, straight forward, and speeds the only truly fiddly aspect of the game.

This is a meat grinder economic / pick up and deliver / logistics game, and I haven't played anything else that it really reminds me of. Players represent independent interests who invest in either production or shipping companies. They then ship goods each round, earn money by either selling goods or shipping them, and then expand their empires. The companies on the table are initially established via draft, but in another phase existing companies can be merged together, and ownership can change completely. A final, extremely good twist, is the R&D track, which allows different players to have very powerful abilities which vastly change the way they can approach the game.

I was worried that this would be another 5 hour Splotter title, normal games seem to run around 3 hours, and it is possible for them to run as short as 2. I have found though, that it is hard to determine when the game will run longer or shorter. In theory, smaller player counts should take longer to play, but they can also end up being quite quick, depending on how the players go about the game. The thing that can make the game last longer is when the last era lasts an extra round or two, because all of the chit fiddling and delivery can take a while. How the boat lines are set up, where and how many cities there are, and if the cities have advanced, and, probably most importantly, the group's tendency to up their expansion speed on the R&D track will all influence how long the game runs. Anyway, despite having a lot of interesting and tough decisions, the game seems to have a very good pace, and it only slows down noticeably on the last turn or two because of the size of the companies.

Some people have mentioned the math factor, and the bidding is a little strange, but it didn't seem to be much of an issue for even me, and my math skills are, to say the least, not impressive. Divvying up the cash after the auction can be irksome because of the weird fractions, but I have downloaded the Indonesia merger calculator to my laptop, and it has not proved to be an issue as a result. 

I might also add, while shipping seemed a bit weak in this game at first blush, I think it is a potentially crushing side ability if one can have one of the big boat companies, and then combine it with another goods empire of some sort. While the cuts that you get from the other players only trickle in, the real benefit of owning lines can be in not having to pay out all of those nickels over the course of several rounds, and THAT can really add up and make certain companies viable. Goods production is still the heart of your money making in this game though, and monopolies, like in real life, tend to be the best way to insure profitability. 

The only real downside of this game to me is the fact that it is horribly overpriced given what you get inside the box, and by 2007 I fully expect this to be nigh impossible to find for under 150$. If you have the cash, and you like big games like this it is highly, highly recommended though. This is one of the best gamer's titles that I've run across in recent years.

Very nice. Some interesting things going on. Not sure it's worth the length though (and I'm not totally against long games). I kinda don't like the thing where you have to use someone's boat and you simply choose who to give money to. (Also don't like that in On The Underground). My one game had an end result of something like 1636 to 1635. So the arbitrary decisions of others decides the outcome. Still, I enjoyed my play and would be happy to play again. Next time I wouldn't ship so many goods over someone else's damn shipping line!

Players are extremely depended on the choices of other players. (Typical for the Splotter games.) Which feels silly to me, to say it mildly. There are no other publishers who would make such games, but Splotter found a market for that.
Theme/mechanics combo is silly too.
60% of the playing time is spent to fiddly things: very unclear board and unhandy game pieces. You must like doing meaningless things to accept that.
Normally I don't judge other authors/publishers, but one of these authors gives all my games a 5. ;)

Indonesia has been on my radar as a vague blip ever since my partner and I chanced upon the lovely box artwork in a forgotten corner at a Spiel long since gone. But with all Splotter games, playtesting to see if the game is something for me and the missus is hard. The games are serious business, last a long time, and require dedicated gamers. Indonesia is no exception... But eventually I managed to find someone willing to bring it to the table.

Indonesia at first struck me as a simple game of pick up and deliver with a vastly overstated playing time, but then the mergers started kicking in and playing time skyrocketed. The various R&D-fields started to hint at their importance too. We struggled with determining the proper worth of bidding for starting player as well as for the various companies. We learned the hard way that a company with short shipping lanes and lots of market delivery potential in expensive goods is exceedingly valuable for the obvious reason that money made by delivering the goods is not shared with the transporting company. All of the above can be briefly summarised thus: Indonesia is without doubt a game that rewards repeat plays until at least the moment that players have a good grasp of the value of the various situations on the board. After that I'm not sure what happens to the game's replay potential.

There are some nits to pick, though. For such a simple concept, the game takes surprisingly long to play to completion. This is not a title you play two to three times in a row after which you pull out the [i]real[/i] games. Indonesia [i]is[/i] the real game, so to speak. This is a double-edged sword as far as I am concerned. I would love to play Indonesia more, but finding the time to get this beast onto the table regularly is difficult. But the time investment is, I think, worth it. Next: The map can become crowded and unclear, which is a dang shame. Geographically it is quite correct, and devoid of game parts it looks gorgeous, but once small provinces around Java start to be filled up with production chits then it becomes cramped and messy. And finally the odd bidding rules necessitate a certain mental agility with numbers. Therefore bidding is not as fluid as could be. And finally I do not like the fact that Indonesia is so darned expensive to purchase. I am really tempted to create my own copy to play until I can find a good copy on the cheap. It has the added advantage of working out some kinks in the original.

But all in all I'm a bit surprised to realise how much I appreciated this Splotter design. I'm definitely thinking about how the game 'ticks', and am also curious after the effect of various other approaches players can take.

Complex and meaty game - just the way I like it. Although I played it for the first time, I felt like I was understanding the rules after a couple of turns. I will play it again and try to come up with better early-mid-late game strategies. It ssems like there are different ways to be successful in this game.
Some downsides:
*The Board and game components. I know that some people might like the board, but I find it outright ugly. Everything on the board is colored in a brownish-grayish hodgepodge that makes it really difficult to distinguish certain map features (like area borders). I strongly feel that a revised map (as seen on BGG) might speed up this game and make it easier to spot trade routes and other connections.
*Too fiddly. Especially later in the game (with 10+ resources), trade routing becomes a time consuming and finnicky aspect.
*Too mathematic. We actually had to use a small program on a computer to figure out the bidding increases and merger splits. 

Overall: Spice + rice = Microwave

Well, to tell the truth, it's not about the country. But the game mechanism is really good. As economic as 18XX games, but with very different mechanisms. A lot of planning, tactical and strategy, a little bit diplomacy and nastiness to other player, make this game very delicious.

Involves a lot of math! Also need poker chips, paper money (though sturdier than most paper money) stinks.

Really though an excellent game that I want to play more to solidify my thinking on it (is it a good game or a great game?). It is interesting how the maps change each game depending on where cities are placed and where players decide to place transport. If only one or two players own all the transport they can lead how the map looks - but may not be able to get the money needed for production mergers.

Now my head hurts.

12/14/16.

Exceedingly poor production values (none of the chits or glass blobs fit on several of the map spaces, map shockingly poor in either letting players know what actually connects to what and allowing chits to be placed in any way that allows one to know that it is there and still have any idea of what is going on underneath it. (small section of the rulebook addresses one of the more tortured spots. This is excacerbated by the fact that as per all Splotter games-this one is quite fiddly-so you are putting little chits next to the glass blobs to try and keep track of whether a city can take any more production or not-but there is no place to put them-so it just quickly becomes a mess.

Flimsy/cheap cardboard on both the cards that tell you where a new city may be placed (also quite small-about the size of a regular Band-Aid yet with tiny detail on which island spaces are allowed) as well as the 'company' cards-super muted color scheme throughout makes it rather dreary. Minimalistic style rulebook (i.e. you will find yourself going back to the forums often for clarification).

And, of course, the world famous outrageous prices for said game.

This is the type of game that is not likely to hit a regular gaming group table but perhaps once a year.

After 2 games, I'm annoyed with this game.  The auctions require a calculator and in the end game, figuring out shipping really bogs down the game.  One player with AP can turn the game into an ordeal.  It's hard to see on the map where the territories are.  Plus I'm not pleased with the quality of the city cards (a minor quibble).

A tight, lengthy, and complex game with zero luck and a good variety of different strategies that can lead to success. I admire its design but I can't say that I love to play it. It's basically pure economics and that's not really fun to me. Also, the game is long but never really changes as it progresses, which makes the last hour or so of gameplay feel like it really drags.

This satisfies an gaming itch that I have not been able to scratch for a long time. A full blown economic/logistical game with multiple paths to victory. Sure it is a little fiddly compared to those 90 minute Euros, but the fiddliness has a purpose. I have extreme restrictions on my gaming time these days, but time playing indonesia is still time extremely well spent... (time passes)
After another 4 or 5 games, my opinion has if anything, strengthened. This is probably my favorite game, which I (at this time) can never imagine refusing to play (given available time).  I have now played it two player, with an evenly matched opponent (not a training game), and had one of the best two player experiences of my life. I can see how a blowout, or slow squeeze to extinction could happen in 2 player (unlike multiplayer, where there are multiple levers at work -with good players). I think the secret to the awesome 2 player experience is to play fairly quickly, without the absolute data crunch. This is also true -to a lesser extent with multiplayer. Doing this will result in errors, but these errors allow for dramatic swings in the game where the end result is not clear... even if you are losing, it is far more fun to shake things up a bit, than die a slow death from shipping constraints (for example).  Too bad this game is so obscure and expensive, it is one of the greats
Ok, another play has shown that with 2 players it can be a bit fragile. It was still very good, and wouldn't prevent me from playing again. We came to an agreement, instead of "going to war" on the turn order technology and delaying the game by 1 hour, we just agreed that we would advance to the last track and continue. I suspect that "going to war" on turn order could happen on multi-player games, but it would be much more likely in 2 player. Still great.
Further addition, with 5 players, the pacing of the game seems a little off, with the game ending before the interesting developments really get in to gear. Strange game that takes less time with 5 players than it does with 3!

Un juego económico muy bonito sobre la mesa. Creas compañías, las haces crecer, después hay fusiones entre ellas, nunca sabes en manos de quien acabarán, a veces interesa hacerlas crecer y "venderlas", otras interesa pujar por ellas. Es un juego rápido (jugando 6 en 2 horas está resuelto), lleno de decisiones inresantes y con intensidad al final de la partida, me gusta !!

RATING: 8
Will take a few plays to really appreciate what this game has to offer, but I sense that it is a great game.  I hate the map--the font is terrible and the boundaries are confusing in some areas.  Paper money is a negative as well as the fiddliness of shipping products during the operations phase.  There is a significant amount of calculation going on as well, particularly during the Merger phase.  

Once you get past all that, I think the game can be enjoyable.  I look forward to multiple plays, but I think it can be less fun of an experience with slow, AP-prone (or perfectionist) players. Better with other players who mostly play from the gut. I also think it is better with 4 than with 5. Similar to Dominant Species, there's just too much going on and too much for players to track (for those players who like to track EVERYTHING) with 5 players. That extra player just adds too much for me. Haven't yet played with 3.

My experiences with Indonesia vary, depending on the players. Some games have been a snooze-fest with players going slow and over-analyzing things. Other games have been exciting and moved along at a good pace.

I was blown away by this game.  Figuring out how to maximize shipped good was an interesting puzzle, and the merger phase is always fun, with huge swings of fortune available to shrewd players.  The box was not as big as I thought it would be.

RATING: 9
Amazing game, somewhat similar to 18xx games, but much better in my own opinion. The heart of the game is in the mergers of companies, but with a mini tech tree, placement of shipping lines, and the ability to plan ahead based on limited knowledge of where new cities will arise, the kinds of skill required are many and varied. Another Splotter masterpiece that defies all categories.

Un economico duro de cojones

La explicacion quedó meridiana, y pese a todo me costó cogerle el punto cerca de un par de horas...si no mas.

Muy muy profundo, con muchas decisiones y mucha diversidad de estrategias.

Y ahora lo malo. Es precioso, pero es mas impracticable que Heidi Klum. En el tablero las regiones estan divididas por lineas delgadisimas y suelen llevar varios tokens con lo que acaban por apenas verse, demas la forma de diferenciar de quien es cada empresa es bastante contraintuitiva teniendo que mirar a cada rato el display de cada jugador para ver cual es el tipo de empresa que tiene y donde. Al menos tuvieron el detalle de utilizar sobre el mapa una cuadricula coordenada... La tipografia preciosa, pero tambien jodidisima de leer sobre el tablero.

Me quedo con ganas de repetir, pero en un tiempo...

This rating system breaks down with long games.  I will RARELY be willing to play this game and I doubt I'll suggest it very often.  I don't often have 3 - 4 hours to dedicate to one game.  On the other hand, I think this game is a fantastic design.  It is very elegant and the mechanics are intertwined in such a manner that it is difficult to understand the ramifications of your moves.  I have only played once (for 6 hours) and I let everyone know that I would probably want to stop after 2 hours or so.  When that time came, I was hoping that everyone would want to continue playing.  I was totally engrossed in the game.  The last turn was too fiddly though.  Way too many options to think through so none of us even tried (which made the winner a bit random).  It should have ended a round earlier at least for that game.  Overall, a great game.

Pretty good game.  A game best played by experienced gamers due to it's fiddiliness.  I'm not sure I'd suggest it, but usually would be willing to play.  I liked the different research tracks. The corporation mergers really seemed to mix it up.   But there were several things about the game that left me feeling a little ambivalent about it. First, I'm not sure how much replayability it will have since the corporations (and cities for the most part) always start out in the same regions.  Second is the horrible board.  The regions inside provinces (and adjacent sea regions) are not at all clearly delineated.  The city "beads" are too big to fit in some of the regions.  Third is that it is very difficult to place a value on a merger.  To truly figure it out, you have to weigh what it costs you to win the merger bid + what you give up from selling it against what you can make off of the merged tiles assuming you keep them for ?however? long.  So you can just wing it and bid w/your gut (what I do) or spend about 15 minutes doing the math...then guessing the rest because you don't know what else could happen in terms of mergers.  Lastly, it is just very fiddly in terms of where your goods are located and how they are transported.  It's possible to move a good across the (land) province to be put on a ship so they can arrive back in the same province for a delivery.

RATING: 8
This is probably my favorite game that I just can't seem to win. I do pretty well regularly: I came in second every game I haven't won, except for the first. I just can't seem to get over the final hump that is required to let me pull out a win. 

Regardless of this, I think Indonesia is a fantastic financial game, with a feel not quite like any other I have ever played. It is always entertaining to see which companies succeed and which fail, and how the smallest of difference in decisions from game to game can have the biggest impact on the game itself. The only truly random factor in the game is which of the random city placement cards are available. This, and the decisions people make in placing the cities can have a dramatic impact on which companies are successful and which ones end up floundering.

The combination of different techs you can R&D also has a dramatic impact on the game, allowing you to pursue different strategies, and having other impacts, both subtle and dramatic, in play.

Add to this both board play, and the impact of mergers, and you end up with an amazing, heavy game that seems to stretch and shudder under the sheer possibilities available in each individual play. 

Unfortunately, the length and sheer annoyanced of the last few turns of the game have started to wear on me. I still intend to play it and get it to the table regularly, but this is enough to prevent it from being the favorite it once was. I prefer Imperial (2030) and 18XX these days.

RATING: 7
Players are company owners, producing goods in the region of Indonesia, and shipping them off to nearby cities for profit.  Players take turns auctioning off player order, acquiring shipping and goods companies, gaining special powers, proposing company mergers, and operating these companies to try and turn a profit.  Goods companies produce stuff, shipping companies move it to market, and each skims some profit to the company owners.  Anybody (within reason) can propose a merger of any two companies on the board, irrespective of ownership, and a bidding war begins.  A luck free, brutal business game for the players who like that sort of thing (18xx players, I guess).  There is nothing particularly difficult about the rules, however the concepts and decisions you're faced with are mind numbing.  Experienced players will destroy the newbies.  Excellent game, with a caveat - you must like business games (and maths).

RATING: 4
A fine game for its genre (comparable to Caylus and Age of Steam), but just too involved (and long) for my tastes, and too much hinges on planning far ahead, i.e. a seemingly meaningless choice turns out to have a huge impact several moves later (in particular, the auction for turn order, choosing a city placement at the start of an era, and deciding which companies to merge all were incredibly non-obvious to me).  Also, I was expecting it to be more like Roads & Boats or Logistico, but it's closer to Bus (competing for delivery to shared destinations); I like Bus, but this just piles on too many additional layers.  Anyway, all that would make it a low 6 or high 5 rating, but the map is very confusing, and the lack of player-colored control markers on the map made it much harder to comprehend the game state.  So I give it a 4.

I'm more sensitive to length and length-to-decision ratio than most. Indonesia seems to be too long and too tedious for what is essentially a train-style production and delivery system. Mergers proved to be an interesting mechanic, but for that interesting mechanic you are investing hours. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Interesting mix of companies and deliveries that need to be made.  The 18xx feel comes from optimizing the routes of the deliveries; the company merger aspect is interesting due to the fact that you can merge any two similar (or spice/rice) companies; even if you have no stake in the transaction or interest in the outcome.  Having a monetary advantage during the merger segment can be of great help as you can merge your companies together, bid all your cash and 'open' a slot for another investment.  Will definitely play again with experienced 18xx gamers.  I feel this game will get more play than R&B; at first blush I enjoy this more as well.

Sigh. Indonesia was a grail game for me but it just doesn't light my fire for the overhead required in terms of game time and fiddliness. Sure, you can compute the shipments and payments painlessly but I find the ratio of time spent doing administration vs planning my moves to be too heavy on the former. I'm constantly disengaging from my strategy to count things rather than lose myself like I do in, say, Through the Ages or Brass. If I spent more time sitting back thinking about strategy I'd love the game. As it is, I do not.

Interesting variation on pick up and deliver, with water routes between multiple ports, expanding production, mergers between production and shipping.  The strategy seems quite varied.  Marred by awkward components (on a nice map), and possible the special rule that last turn income is doubled.  That one round makes the win.  Keeping track of when things happen again is also confusing (phases, turns, eras).

The play is strong, strategy great, and the cut throat level high which makes the game fun.

However, by the time Hull capacity gets to 4 & 5, the game becomes cumbersome with keeping track of how many goods shipped & on whose ship how many times.  All the small cardboard pieces are difficult to work with.  The board becomes very messy, very cluttered.  I do not mind games with lots of pieces, but this one is just fiddly flipping lots of thin little tiles over & over again.  Also the very beautiful script is difficult to read and the map design creates some confusion.

Very interesting game.  I'd like to play again.  Similar weight to Steam Over Holland but with different things going on.  I would rate it higher but I'm not convinced that I would turn down an 18xx game of similar length to play this instead.

I need to play it again to see if the overall length shortens.  It wasn't a problem the first game but it would be for subsequent plays.  Calculations seem just as intense as an 18xx game, however predicting income is more difficult because of the delivery dynamics. In my opinion this will potentially make AP worse than since outcomes won't be as easily predictable.  I may very well be wrong when comparing heavier 18xx games with more possible stock manipulations.

Simple mechanics, yet complex interactions.  Really a joy to play and see how your companies grow. The game is almost entirely in the mergers.  Not that you should always develop your merger capability, but you must always have a good idea of not only who could merge a company away from you at any time, but the consequences of winning and losing that merger since you will either be much better or worse able to defend your remaining holdings.  Often someone will sacrifice one of their smaller holdings in order to catch the really big fish.  If you can pull off this balance you're on the road to victory.  Misstep once and you could put yourself out of the game.

This game scratches a similar itch to 18XX games but it takes only half the time. The mergers mechanic is so unique. The research and development tree is so interesting. Transport companies versus production companies and the tight interdependencies among them is very compelling. The positioning of the ships, companies and cities and how products flow in the operation rounds is truly engrossing. Knowing when to propose a merger and when to invest on them is the crux of the game. I love every aspect of it. It stands as my current second favorite game.

RATING: 9
A game of many colours.  My first playing appeared to make Indonesia an intense deeply strategic affair with tons of long term planning.  My second outing turned coat and Indonesia felt highly tactical (which in a way upset the initial impression of the game) and made the early choices detrimental and the game became a processional exercise.  That said, I believe Indonesia is a brilliant design it just depends on having a lot more knowledge of the game's arc to make it work.  There is a nice balance here to the tactical and strategic approaches, but I believe now the former must be considered predominantly in the early game.  With cities popping up in unknown areas early attempts to monopolize certain regions can destroy any attempts to be competitive.  There is an interesting meta-game going on in Indonesia, as all players are forced to be partners in industry, and at the same time making sure such symbiotic relationships are personally profitable.  Referencing back to having knowledge of the game's arc, if players can not adhere to the flow of the engine, Indonesia can easily become a rich get richer game - which can leave a bad taste in new comers.  The R&D track is very cool, and the mergers mechanic is definitely interesting.  There is a lot to like here. All in all I believe when my understanding of all things Indonesia begins to gel this could be a classic.   

There are some issues with the production.  In attempts to make the board a beautiful old-world style representation it in turn lost functionality.  Some crucial boundaries are difficult to determine, and then additions like the equatorial line can confuse matters.  

Some may find the game too fiddly.  There are a lot of chits, that get shuffled about that can lead to very visual clutter.  But if given a chance this really becomes manageable, even if a little annoying.

"Pure" economic game with a heavy dose of tactics.  Pretty steep price, but a good gamer's game if you can shell out the equivalent 2-3 games worth for it.  It's not nearly as heavy as it's rated.  I think the publisher's reputation for heavy games has biased the weight upwards.

My initial thoughts after my first play is that this game does an excellent job of simulating the value of fixed assets and liquid capital as well as capturing the value and power of each. A lot of really good stuff going on here. The mergers are a fantastic mechanism. The R&D chart is also very fun to use and I think will make each game different. Small complaints are the board could have been more clear and by the end of the game the fiddly factor is up there, but we used a program on a laptop to simplify the calculations. Great game, looking forward to playing again!

An excellent shipping and finance game from Splotter. It's somewhat less chit-happy than Roads & Boats or Antiquity, but quite a bit more mathy. Do yourself a favor and bring both poker chips and a merger value chart to the table.

RATING: 8
Played this a few times now.  Wow, we completely missed the value of mergers the first time, since that's often the cornerstone of the whole game.  Really interesting game.  My main quibble with the game is that the board design should have been a little more focused on playability over look.  The script on the board, and the sometimes confusing territory delineations make for a more difficult than  necessary experience.  I also wonder if there is a way to make the bits management somewhat less fiddly.

Much fun, though.  We'll continue to play this one for a while.

Components: standard for a Splotter game, the board is hard to read and the chits are not very functional
Complex: easy rules, hard to master
Weight: heavy
Players: 4-5
Length: 3-4 hours
Opinion: just one word...amazing!!! I love this game, the rules are quite easy but it is really hard to master the game. The board is like a nightmare on the first games, but after that you manage well. 
Regarding the mechanics, they are lovely.. one research you make each turn without paying, cities that are not from anyone and how you have to deal with your companies and the transport of your products to the cities (using anyone transport company and paying for that). The idea that you must deliver products if you can goes to a tense play of where to deliver and where to expand your ships. The merge phase is really funny and you have to learn how to master it well, a new player can ruin your game, as well as a crazy player (this could be the only negative point, all players have to be experienced).
In a nutshell, the game is tense until the end, beware of the mergers, expand your company to the best places and take care of all those transports

Indonesia is the best business game I’ve played since Age of Steam. Players take the role of wheeler-dealers trying to get rich by developing production and shipping companies throughout the islands of Indonesia. Players begin by seeding the board with a handful of small cities. Small companies will emerge on the various islands producing rice, spices, rubber, and eventually oil. These companies will grow or stagnate depending on whether their goods are able to reach market. Cities will grow when supplied with goods, and larger cities will demand even more goods. But none of this can happen without developing the proper shipping routes – and the shipping companies themselves are owned by the players.

Players will soon be able to announce mergers among the various companies, and these mergers can cripple companies as easily as they can enrich them. Merged companies are auctioned publicly, and vast fortunes can change hands in the blink of an eye. Some companies will be developed with an eye toward long-term profitability. Others will be acquired for the sole purpose of re-selling them almost immediately. Players will soon discover that Indonesia is a freewheeling and unstable climate for doing business. But they will be able to invest in business infrastructure that cannot be taken away, bonuses and specialties that function like “technology” in other games.

Indonesia plays in 2 to 3 hours and appears to scale well from 3 to 5 players. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys meaty, unforgiving buisiness games like Age of Steam, Power Grid, and 18xx.

This is an economic game without stock manipulation, which is a big plus in my book. It is not a hard game to learn, but only during one go of the game there seemed to be a lot of strategies to explore. It seemed to revolve much around how and when you make a merger, but there certainly seemed to be other parts of the game too. I would love to play this game much more, but sadly I don’t think I will have opportunities too often to do it.

Indonesia is, well, a Splotter - I have yet to encounter one whose uniqueness, idiosyncrasy, and ground-up design  hasn't tickled my curiousity! Indonesia is an economic game of production and shipping with emergent valuation which largely centers around, like with other Splotters, timing and spatial logistics. Similarly to TGZ, I found that the very limited actions made every choice hurt in a good way. I also love the typical (to Splotter) turn-order auctions here as well which provide a great deal of turn-order shenanigans -- the nice touch here is that every dollar spent towards the auction counts towards your final score (even if it is taken out of circulation and is no longer liquid). My only complaint is that the map has a few too many difficult to ascertain cases (and that the logistics phase requires a conceptual mastery of what it is meant to represent). The game itself is quite beautiful as well.

Lovely? Yes. Fiddly? Yes. Longish? Yes. Worth it despite high price tag & involved economic game? Yes. Indonesia is the 1st Splotter I have managed to get to the table.

It's a smart Euro, with a nice look, and interesting & somewhat different economic engine, and a lot of timing niceties, as well as application of bid strategies involved in winning.

On a 1st solo 4-player game I gave this a 7.25.  Three of the 4 players were very close in overall value; the 4th won it, and of course they were the shipping magnate.

But other than figuring out how to defend your Shipping companies from hostile mergers, and how to minimize your shipping costs/maximize your personal profits, when to let go of Production companies and when to grab them up (or when to start a cat fight for a desireable merged company) I thought it an enjoyable and different economic game.

Seems not undeserving of high esteem and BGG geek-cred; this one is a lot of game, and I look forward to opening and playing more Splotters as time permits.

In depth economics game selling various commodities along shipping lanes. Acquisitions and mergers of the various companies are the key to this game.  Somewhat confusing game mechanics, but after several turns is easy to pick up. Has a Civilization and Seafarers of Catan feel to it. Requires more thinking than I care to for this kind of game, and very little luck.

Update (05/30/12): After playing Antiquity and seeing a few other Spiel Splotten designs, I can appreciate the relative cleanness of this design, which has comparatively fewer bits. As I contemplate my one experience, I recall it was a cerebral, dry experience. Do I want to get this? No. Is there a sense of urgency to play this? No. Would I play this again? Maybe. Rating down from '7' to '6'.

Update (05/31/2014) (Ironic that I would make a comment update two years and one day later.) In the six years after my only play of this, I now enjoy medium-to-heavy weight games. After playing The Great Zimbabwe tonight, and having finally appreciating Antiquity, I think I may be ready to revisit this. What is all the fuss about? I'm intrigued.

I was hoping I'd like this but I didn't - it was just too fiddly & not very exciting.

An interesting game but with terrible components. An accurate looking map is not very playable as some of the places are much smaller than the pieces. The choice of colours for pieces makes it very difficult to see who owns what. Glass pebbles are pretty but not useful as city markers, they should be large enough to hold the goods. We didn't have the original goods pieces and substitutes were less than perfect.

RATING: 8
A very clever economic game, perhaps a bit too clever. The merger mechanism is unique and the thing that drives the game, but deciding which companies (if any) to merge can be a tough call. A bit less fiddle than most Splotter games, but the later Operating rounds can be pretty tedious and leave you wishing the process could be computerised. Container is easier to appreciate and plays in about one third of the time.

Its a very pretty game, but some of that prettiness affects gameplay in that theres some very unclear areas of the board.  

It also seems like the "era" cards that denote where cities can be please could be a bit clearer, a mistake on my part due to it being a new game really made the game difficult as we were missing a city in a major part of the map that ended up hurting a couple players pretty badly. 

I did enjoy the game greatly however, it took me a few turns to understand the game, and I shot myself in the foot early in the game and there was no real recovery, but I think next time I may have more of an idea as to strategy, looking forward to a second play.

A good game.  A very good game, in fact.  It reminds me of 18xx to a surprising extent - they're both no-luck route-building economic games with generous doses of vicious capitalist shenanigans (though in this respect Indonesia is almost like inside-out 18xx - you can't dump companies on other people, but you can steal companies or simply mess with other players via hostile mergers). In fact, I think Indonesia is a better short 18xx game than "real" short 18xx games like Poseidon.  You really do get the same intensity packed into a few hours playing time.  The merger auctions can be delightfully mind-bending affairs since valuation is often quite opaque - the fact that the proceeds are split proportionally among the sellers only adds to the fun and opens up some really interesting maneuvering.  Unfortunately, another Indonesia/18xx similarity is the grueling late-game operations phases that really sap the momentum of play.  That is the main strike against it and is what keeps me from rating it higher.  If it weren't so expensive and hard to find I would probably buy it - fortunately thanks to SlothNinja you can play it online for free (and have the computer do all the pesky operations for you!).

I played Indonesia for about 30 minutes or so. The remaining 3.5 hours of the game were spent watching the other players try to figure out the mass of chits and wood on the board while I made the most obvious moves I could come up with. The drab board is nigh impossible to decipher, and the bookkeeping would be much better done by a computer. I will defend a lot of games that are a bit too fiddly, but this was way too much. Repeated plays might make it a little easier to figure out, but I think the bits would still slow this game down way too much for me.

Also, they don't have anywhere near as many boats in the game as necessary.

Area control resource game.  Takes a simple area control element, combines it with a pick-up and deliver, then throws in an auction mechanic that forcibly merges your resource company (or delivery company) and hands it to the highest bidder (but victory is completely dependant on $$, so you want to get bought out).  Surprisingly deep with distinct press your luck element and player interaction that isn't always negative.

May09:  Good game, don't ever need to do that again. Way too many little bits.

Operating rounds? Fricking hell. 40 minutes of ZERO interesting decisions? Sure, I'll operate my rice first to cut him out of some cities... but that's going to add up to like $20-30 bucks in the long run.

The game was won or lost in the mergers. And only about half the players were even eligible for most of the mergers. Okay, more than half, but there were definitely turns where someone just starred on for 20-30 minutes while people tried to bid in increments of 7.

You might think I was bitter because I lost, but I actually won by about $300.

You put all the little chits next to the cities. And then you take them all back.

Then you stare at the map for 2-3 minutes trying to decide if you can reach a city in 2 hops instead of 3 hops.

Yea, I'll go back to Acquire. I've never had anyone confuse what was adjacent there.

Heck, I'll go back to Brass. Rules are more complicated, but the play is about 10x smoother.


Having ranted, I think the mathematics of Indonesia is very interesting. In early mergers, you had to estimate what impact losing your liquid cash would have on you. Also, you had to calculate the ROI on a Marginal basis since you could almost always just pick up another company for free to fill that slot.

Lots of interesting decisions, but actually not as many as are in a 30 minute game of RftG to me. Heck, I'd drop it to more like 15-20 decisions the whole dang game actually:

5x R&D
5-6x Company PickUps
4-5x Big Mergers
1x Operating... MAYBE

So yea, glad to have played it with a great group of gamers, but I'm done.

Truly a gamer's game.  You have to play it a handful of times to get the grip on it and play really consciously (when and what to acquire, when and what to merge, when and what to defend before takeover, when to be first in turn order and *WHY*, which R&D tracks to develop and in which order (precise planning is required)...).

Fabulous game.  I admire the complexity of play coming from relatively simple rules and how the decision tree expands from a humble and simple beginning.

No doubt in my mind - this and Roads&Boats are the best Splotters.

Indonesia is the _only_ game where the omnipresent need for calculating and crunching numbers doesn't bother me at all.

EDIT: The 3-player mode seems the best one.  With 4 players there is less control and fewer turns (the game races too much).
I will never try 5-player game.

Fascinating economic game, very realistic in most things.  Has the merging company element of Acquire but there is WAY more going on in this game.  Lots of analysis and domino effects, no luck, mostly tactical but some conniving plans can be hatched.  

Very intriguing and interesting watching how things develop and very dynamic with things changing on the fly, don’t want to be in the shipping business anymore? Sell off your company and get into a production company instead with the money you earned!  Some good variety in game play comes in with the research track as you might try different things from game to game.

A fantastic, viciously subtle game. Would be an 8 except for the beautiful but less-functional components (map, boats, etc) and the fiddliness of the operations rounds.

The map is gorgeously different and only mildly dysfunctional. The streamlined economic system offers, if not [i]new[/i] then at least refreshing gameplay. Both the map and the economy give this real theme--espcially for a Euro. 

Nothing here feels bolted on; no actions feel like they're there for the pure sake of game balance. Yet Indonesia [i]is[/i] balanced. And not just from a "everyone has an equal chance" perspective, but a perfect balance of constraint (which makes a game playable) and openness (which makes a game enjoyable.)

Indonesia meets one of my prime criteria for a great game-early turns matter, but comebacks are possible (and not through means of an artificial game device, but because of the delicate nature of the game world.)

I like the R&D chart, how and where cities grow, how companies begin and merge, and the eras. I like how the game builds.

I don't know if we had a fast group or what; but four of us learned the rules (we were all new) and finished a game in 2 1/2 hours. A testament to logical and cohesive rules. If Indonesia maintains this play time, it will become one of my favorites.

RATING: 6
First play: Wow, I like it a lot. In a way, very 18xx-like, in terms of being long, heavy, filled with difficult decisions, and requiring a lot of calculation. A very fulfilling game experience - despite me ending in last place in the game. :-)

The components have usability problems, the board in particular. The rules themselves are quite simple, but since the development of the game's progress is entirely in the hands of the players, there's a lot to think about. The game is very unforgiving, and it is easy to dig a hole for yourself that you can't get out of.

Game mechanisms are surprisingly streamlined, with only endgame shipping being on the fiddly side.

My biggest problem with the game, and a potential showstopper for my enjoyment of it, is the issue of when a player has a choice in what shipping companies to use to transport his goods. Using player A or player B's ships leads to an entirely arbitrary "I'll help one player at the expense of the other" situation, which in turn easily translates into involuntary (or deliberate!) kingmaking. My first game saw my competing shipping company owner whining about how bad his position was, to the degree that almost all shipping in the last turn was done using his company, at my expense. And of course, in the end, he wasn't so bad off after all (and he certainly ended up a lot better than me). Yuck. Hopefully, with experience, it will be easier to determine how well players are really doing, and arbitrary kingmaking will come to a stop. If not, too bad for an otherwise excellent game. :-( For now, I'll rate the game as if the problem doesn't exist. If it persists, expect me to cut my rating in half.

Initial Rating: 8.5 (May 2012)

What a surprise! When I played Indonesia I didn`t expect to find this jewel of a game. If you like economic games this is a must!

It is a little heavy but it is a game I want to play again. In particular the mergers require basic math that can push away some gamers but the game is meaty enough for me to bypass that. As with Antiquity, this game can be very unforgiving, if you do wrong choices at the beginning of the game you are, effectively, out of the game, which is a plus for me :D. 

It seems it has different viable paths to victory but I have to play more to verify this.

The game is marvelous, however for an expensive game like this I found the errors on the game board to be unforgivable (there are 3 print errors on the map as well as on some cards). The Indonesia map is pretty but it doesn’t help the gameplay in any way, also the rulebook is confusing at times (but the rules are relatively simple).

In conclusion, Indonesia is a great gamer´s game, fit for only hardcore gamers due to its heaviness and time factor. A must have for me.

With a second play I ratify this is a great game, the rating just went up to a 9 and perhaps it will go higher. Also I´m not so sure the game is as unforgiving as I thought, but I still feel it is unforgiving enough for me. It seems if you made bad decisions at the start is hard to recover but not impossible.

It’s been hard to get Indonesia to the table, but I managed to sneak another play :D. Nowadays I’m much more harsher with my ratings, but I still feel Indonesia is a good game.

I will buy it in the future and I´m usually willing to play it, so it is a 7.0 for me. I’m updating the rating.

A logistics game like Roads and Boats, but with the introduction of a profit motive on the shipping; no one will accuse this game of resembling multiplayer solitaire.  Played with 3-4 fast players this game is economic nirvana, if you're into that sort of thing.

The game does bog down in the operation phases, and a bad move in a merger can put one out of the game with a couple hours to go.  Because of those hurdles Indonesia takes a few plays to figure out and enjoy, which is a high barrier to entry for many.  It's worth it.  I don't feel like I've nearly played it out yet.

While it pained me to do so I traded it away.  The sheer length of the game means it would be played at best annually.  

The game board is terrible, and the game is fiddly but there's a lot going own in this game...and it's called goodness.  I would recommend strongly urging someone in your game group to pick this up...haha (can be trickey to find and demand a pretty penny).

An outstanding game that flows quite smoothly after just a few rounds - the map could use some work and I don't like the use of script for map names - and sometimes it was hard to differentiate the border lines between areas. But this game really works (and that sort of depresses me as now I need to raise the $100 to buy it) - 5 player took just over 4 hours and the time just flew by.

RATING: 6.5
First impression...

Too long.  Too fiddly.  Too inconsistent.  Terrible map and rules.

But, in the end... I kind of liked it.  (but I always have a soft spot for games that I win first time out...)

I'd have given the game a couple of more points if only the map wasn't so inappropriate.  And the fact that bidding for turns is 'once around' and then bidding for mergers is 'open' seemed to be contradictory to the tone of the game. (If I have my way... ALL bids would be sealed!)

NOT being able to ship goods over land seemed to be really strange, too.  I'm growing my spices right next to a city but I still have to ship by boat?  Ludicrous.

And the rule that says you have to ship everything you can on a turn... is just plain stupid and makes the game twice as long as it have to be.  Let's see... if I use this boat to ship I can only deliver 6 of my 7 goods... oh, but if you use the other player's boat I can ship 5, and then ship one more on the red boat and one of the blue... "thanks for pointing that out!"  Let me play my own game thank-you.  If I miss something, it's my loss not yours.

Even with the 4.5 hour play time, I had fun... and isn't that what its all about?  It's not going to be a game I request... but if it's available, I'll probably play again.

A re-designed map, proper rules with many full colour examples, and a couple of variant house rules would make this game a classic... as it is... just average.

Really nice game and possibly my favorite from Essen 2005. Deciding how you want to approach the game will determine how you want to move up the R&D track. Understanding mergers is critical since a poorly timed merger by a player can help out a player you really don't want to help. Good stuff.

RATING: 9
This game takes its core ideas from the 18xx series and streamlines the basic concepts in a very cool way. Even though this is clearly a money game, money is only used in-game for two things, bidding for turn order and executing mergers. Two primary decision points each turn surprisingly cost nothing to perform - acquiring new companies and advancing on the development track. So even though you earn money through operating your companies, the money is then primarily given to other players when you take one of their companies in a merger. A merged company theoretically earns more, but timing is key, as mergers late in the game or between two shipping companies who cover that same area may never pay off. It seems quite possible to win this game by acquiring and selling a series of smaller (single deed) companies rather than growing large (multi-deed) conglomerates.

Ah, there's just so much to consider, so much money being shuffled between players, so many possible paths. My only concern is that some of the development options feel underpowered, but they may not be with the right strategic use. I certainly plan to find out!

An extremely deep game of production, transportation and mergers diffusing over space and time, Indonesia is a vast and wonderful experience that's always familiar but never the same. I can think of no better game at 3-4 hours than Indonesia. 

Full of difficult decisions, players are constantly evaluating the worth of everything as companies and cities emerge throughout the board. While one can see where companies and cities are likely to emerge, it is the players who ultimately determine placement of individual cities and initiate company acquisitions, expansions, and mergers, thereby ensuring that no two games are alike.

Yes Indonesia is on the longer side, some feel the mergers are too mathy, and still some cringe at the fiddly operations phase as the game comes to a crescendo; however, I am so thoroughly engaged throughout that I barely notice such things. Those looking for a bold, deep economic experience look no further, Indonesia is here.

Rating based on only about 5-6 plays.  This is a game I like and want to play more, but the length and complexity make it hard to find opponents.  The steep price means others are unlikely to be familiar with the game, also a barrier to repeated play.  The variable length (based on how soon people research things like "slots" and "mergers") is an issue.  Still, it's an engrossing business game -- you really need to know how to evaluate companies, particularly given the double income rules for the final turn.

I got an expensive new hobby, Splotter games. Lucky they don't make too many. 

Only one game under my belt so far but very enjoyable. Each turn starts with my most hated game mechanic, turn order auction, then it get's better.

Won my first game with more luck than judgement. A crucial merger was kicked of by one of the other players who did not realise that I had more money than him. It was for the microwave thingy. I won it and maintained a monopoly all game as I also won a later merger for the same product.

[b]Updated Comment after 10 plays[/b]:Every game develops differently. Players determine how long the game will be, what the trade routes will be, to what extent cities will grow, etc. The mergers in the game give company ownership a dynamic, interactive quality that is simply missing from other economic games, even the hallowed 18xx series (which can't hope to compare to Indonesia, if you ask me). This is the most engrossing multiplayer title I've come across. It is fluid, challenging, and fathomless.

[b]Earlier Comment[/b]: Indonesia is a game about generating wealth. A turn is deceptively simple. You may acquire a fledgling company (if your firm is ready to diversify), merge existing companies, advance one of six avenues of R&D, and operate your companies (ship goods to meet demand). It's a sequence that produces deep, satisfying gameplay with particularly rich player interaction.

Let's talk about the mergers. In Indonesia, Mergers are not proposed, they are announced (although you must upgrade your ability to merge larger and larger companies). You can announce the merger of two companies owned by two separate opponents, as long as you can afford the minimum bid. If you're rich, you can go for the jugular and try to wrest control of the new company. If you succeed, you'll be cash-poor next round facing two cash-heavy opponents. Or, you can simply set the ball rolling and watch your competition fight over the new company. Of course you can announce a merger that includes a company you already own. If your company is superior to your opponent's, you can expect them to raise the share price as much as they are able before cashing out. Catch them when they're cash-poor and you'll score a major boon. Speaking of which, you've got to watch your own cash to protect booming companies. Someone may announce a merger between a tiny, irrelevant company and your own juggernaut - essentially a takeover bid for the juggernaut.

Each session of Indonesia also seems to develop its own unique character, based on the placement and growth of cities, the shipping routes, varying consolidation among companies, etc. I won't be tiring of it any time soon.

RATING: 6
This game provokes a heady mix of love and hate in me. I love the graphic design, although there are a few practical issues which were not handled well. I love the dynamic flow of company ownership and the organic evolution of the various shipping lanes and growing regions. The tech tree is extremely well implemented, and most notably the ability to propose mergers is a tech which is a very clever idea which adds a lot of interesting situations to the game.

What does bother me considerably is the amount of maths in that game. It detracts from the flow of the game and sifts attention away from stuff I'd rather be thinking about. It's also tedious to keep track of how much carrying capacity each ship has expended. A hefty portion of the playtime is devoted to these tedious and boring bookkeeping exercises. The fact that the game remains engaging despite that is a testament to how wonderful the underlying dynamics of the game are. 

What is a far more serious issue is that the game is one of perfect information which leads to unimaginable calculations if one wants to avoid helping a particular player too much. Everyone is obligated to avoid helping the leader which naturally lends itself to close scores. In the final round it can easily be the case that the players can arrange for one or another of them to win.

It's not clear yet to me if the good out weighs the bad in this game. Certainly if king making remains an issue in future plays I will give up on this game entirely.

Very open economic game of mergers & acquisitions. Games can be expected to play very differently and I'm keen to play this more to explore the possibilities. The rules are not that complicated. The difficulty is more in understanding the resulting game mechanisms and how to benefit from them as the game is opaque on first contact. There is no luck element in this game other than the other players actions. These can be detrimental if the consequences of an action are not fully understood. The only other critique is the fiddlyness of delivering products in the endgame. But the depth of play makes it worth it.

The game length of 3-4 hours may be a challenge for those of us who are impatient, particularly with slower players. The mechanics are very clever, from deciding how to "advance" your corporate abilities, to the choosing of city cites and city growth, and how turn order can affect deliveries. The merger dynamics are awesome. Shorter game time would put this in league with Age of Steam and garner a 10, but I'll dock it 1 point for game length and 1 more point for mediocre functionality of the components (they're pretty, but at times you struggle to interpret the board.)

I really like this, probably more than any other Splotter game. The map and components are gorgeous, the game doesn't drag (3 hours for a heavy economic game is pretty good), and it's obviously much more of a game of picking the right long-term strategies for the circumstances than tactical nickel and dime optimization.

The main complaint is that the most boring part of the game (the near-trivial task of operating the companies) takes the most time. It'd be interesting to figure out some way of making it less fiddly without changing the underlying economic engine (which is critical to feed information into the interesting parts of the game: mergers, acquisitions and research).

This game is the EURO of ALL EUROS!! A level of luck approaching zero and a remarkable variability in ways to win. Our group tends to play a different game every two or three weeks. We played this one for 3 months solid (and will still play at any time)! No two games were EVER alike. Simple rules - remarkably subtle strategy! Two complaints: (1) components could have been better for the price and (2) the price. Nevertheless, it IS worth the pricetag. This game is screaming for a North American publisher to reprint it with better components. Somebody, anybody listening...?

Provisional rating.  Very good business game.  I can see how complaints about the map (especially relative to the chit size) are valid - it can become a little confusing.

One of the most boring and long games I've ever played. If you're looking for a game that ties Java for analysis-paralysis, this is it. I found it more an exercise in book-keeping than a game.

I suppose at its very heart, the game is about bidding and mergers. The stupid odd increment system is a pain (try bidding in multiples of 7 - up to 300) and its just too much work for such a long game.

Indonesia is a game in which 2-5 players build up an economy. As the game unfolds, the basic agricultural economy develops into early industry - the players getting rich in the meantime by producing and transporting goods, and by acquiring and merging companies at the right time, and for the right price. The game takes three to four hours to complete.

Initially, I thought this was a great game.  I was fond of the ingenious ways that the city growth and how the economic system worked.  I rated it an 8.

However, I have become somewhat disenchanted with the game (after 8 plays).  The problem is that it is too long so it doesn't get onto the table often.

I'm not sure if there's anything revolutionary about Indonesia. It's a pick up and deliver game. What were you expecting? 

Except it does everything so well - and, functionality aside, it's so pretty to look at - that for its genre, it's utterly incomparable, and I'd rather play this than any 18xx, by a mile. 

The rules are relatively straightforward, and the game should only be intimidating to people who insist on really exhaustive minimaxing. I can't think of a decision here that should take longer than three or four minutes. The money equals veeps, and there's a lot of it floating around, meaning rather granular decisions about how to make your money; alongside a purely emergent market for turn order that will have some people scratching their heads, keep this game far, far away from your friends who suffer from severe AP. 

People complain about the map. Look, it's really not that hard. I wish it was bigger, sure, but this is a Splotter game, and while the production values are very high, their idiosyncratic style can mean pieces bigger than the spaces they're supposed to fit in, etc. It's really not a huge problem, just a minor inconvenience.

Overall, I feel really glad to have gotten my hands on my copy, and it was money very well spent. This will get played over and over. Once I've confirmed its replayability, it'll definitely go up to a 10.

------
After second play
------

This time, we tried a number of new (to us) strategies. I, for one, happily allowed my opponents to merge with my companies, as long as I knew I would have the opportunity to merge again later. Lesson: he who merges last merges loudest, most of the time.

One of my opponents tried something interesting, also: throwing out merger after merger in the final round. I'm not sure it worked out all that well for him, because I ended up in control of all shipping on the board, and made around $1,100 in one turn (!) due to the final-round doubling. I'm not sure this strategy isn't a winner, especially when you can get people to chase the merger a little too far. 

Altogether, I'm convinced. This is firmly lodged in my top three games. It's a real humdinger. Every game is surprisingly different. I can promise you that this'll be worth every penny you spend on it.

Indonesia is an interesting and engaging economic game which plays relatively quickly.  Acquiring or losing companies via mergers is a basic and essential part of gameplay.  It appears that each game could develop quite differently.

The game board is ridiculous and does not rate highly in functionality.  Clearly a certain aesthetic was desired but that look is not fitting thematically (late 20th Century industrial) nor is it at all practical from a playability standpoint.  The tiny land spaces are not nearly large enough for the chits that sit on top of them.  Furthermore the lines that delineate those spaces are very faint and hard to identify.  A pretty design but not appropriate.  The rules are straightforward and easy to understand.

I don't really understand the comments about it being mathy.  Certainly some math is involved but it's by no means daunting.  In fact, I feel that the method for valuing mergers and bid increments is simple and straightforward and makes the necessary calculations relatively easy.

Overall, I'm not a fan of the theme and certainly not the board design.  I recognize that this is a good and popular game and so I'd play this again if others wanted to but otherwise I'd prefer to play something else simply based on theme and board design.

Just one play.  The initial session was confusing and slow.  We never got it back on the table.  Too bad, I have remote friends who tell me this can be a swift interesting game.  I'd play again, but now it will have to be on someone else's copy.

Six years later... and I have again played this game.  I am still not finding the spark.  I see so many geek buddies heaping praises on this game.  I can see there is a lot of room in this game for trying stuff.  I will need another few games, much closer together to begin to see how to play well.  Just not sure I'm keen to do this.

The map... I suppose some feel it is pretty.  But I was dreaming of a better map as we played.  The faint lines, the longitudinal lines, the slashes between icons in regions... Drove me crazy, and then the counters are bigger than some of the territories.  Is there something wrong with color?

Paying for shipping felt very fiddly.  I learned pretty quickly that you don't want to leave your fate to other players transportation planning.

I really do see that one could study this game to become a better player.  I just wish I had more intuition about what I should be attempting to do.  This opacity combined with my nits above reduces my enthusiasm to a "only if requested" will I play.

A fantastic economy - well - simulation actually! 
I just see two flaws which prevent me from giving a clear 10:
First the fiddlyness with the shipping in the endgame - it´s sometimes hard to keep track which ship has already cargoed his full capacity (hulls).
Second is the income doubling in the last turn which gives the start player a huge advantage over the others.
But a great game, nevertheless!

The basic mechanism is simply pick-up-and-delivery, but the real meat of the game is in the acquisitions, mergers and R&D development choices. Games last some 4 hours which is very reasonable. Interaction between the players is high for a Splotter game. The player interaction also ensures replayability, despite the rather fixed starting positions for the companies. Early player decisions have quite some impact on how the game progresses (e.g. big cities with lots of production versus small cities and very little production). Only minor point are the constant calculations in the second and especially third era.

Splotter's best. The rules work really nice together and gameplay is very, very deep. Don't overanalyze, though. Play quicker and enjoy another play! It really grows on me and seems to get better with more plays. A must for fans of games of economy and transport (like, say 18xx).

Indonesia is a game in which 2-5 players build up an economy. As the game unfolds, the basic agricultural economy of rice and spices develops into early industry (rubber, microwave dinners :) and oil).
The players acquire income by producing and transporting goods, and by acquiring and merging companies at the right time, and for the right price.


So this is a game about timing but timing isn't as easy in other games.

This is because of the R&D track. You can upgrade your actions in the R&D phase of the game. There is a lot more to the game but the R&D track had me sweating. And while i think i played the rest Okay with the exception of an early merger my position on the R&D track hurted me a couple of times. So I tell you a little about that

The R&D track consists of a number of areas
Turn order bid multiplier (turn order can be important because you get to start each phase first; the only thing negative about that is that you don't know what someone else will upgrade and that you have to bid for turn order first
slots: the number of slots represents the number of companies you can hold. This is very important. I couldn't bid on a merger because I hadn't free slots.
Mergers: A player who moves up this track can call for mergers. The max number of company deeds involved in the merger indicated by the position on the track. You can only merge two companies (a company can consist of one,two, three and even four company deeds)Mergers are the key to victory. In order to win a merger you have to have enough money available and a free slot. In case one of the companies being merged is your own you don't need a free slot
Expansion when your company is able to sell every good produced it has too expand for free if possible. the number on this track show how many expansions. it has too is very important. Since you are obliged to sell the most you can it is possible that you will be selling at a loss because of huge shipping costs
Hull space at the start of the game a ship can only transport one good of a production company. the number on this track tells us how many goods of one company a ship can carry.

Since a game lasts approx 7 turns. You can only upgrade 7 times.

Slots: I had three (2 upgrades, my first two upgrades) but missed out on a merge because I didn't have a slot available
Hull space : I had three in the end (2 upgrades)
Turn order : I upgraded it once. Not sure if that was a good move
Expansion Upgraded once
Merger : upgraded once
I missed opportunities because of slots,mergers,expansions and hull space. Given the fact that turn order is pretty important too the decision on this gives you opportunities but also restricts you in other areas.
Just Brilliant.

 I was afraid of the number of counters being a splotter game but there is absolutely no need to. If you like economic games try it.

Absolutely fantastic game! Normally I'm not a big fan of games which takes this much time, but Indonesia just rocks. A lot of interactions so you'll have to plan your moves very carefully or you are in a big trouble. Components aren't the best ones available and there are some minor usability issues too, but you can live with them. Endgame takes some time too (a lot of shipping and moving goods), but hey, the end is near then already. There is always a chance to play the game in a way, where you don't have any more chances to win the game, but that's the way it goes if you play badly.

Just dont get my toughts wrong - those issues earlier are just little ones: Indonesia offers a superb experience (even when your effort isn't enough for victory (been there, done that).

A one-of-a-kind novel game with interesting and somewhat distinct mechanics, and a nice artistic style. It might take a little to explain on the first go around, but after that it flows well.

It has an incredible depth of interactivity, where almost all player actions ripple across to every other element of the game. In this respect it is 18xx-like.

It is a game of negotiation and deception, and of navigating your way through the turbulence of other players actions.

RATING: 9
Played once, 4p.  Right - my first 9.  This is simply a beautiful euro game, very thin theme, with a questionably useful board.  However, the gameplay is superb, emphasizing timing over and money management, as well as trying to come to terms with losing companies that "you" started.  A great way to spend 4 hours, if you can get through the very non-intuitive rules - however, I found that the rules were fairly simple to follow after a round.

RATING: 10
An extremely dynamic and highly interactive business (mergers & takeover acquisitions) game with lots of business board tactics, ploys and decisions to make.  There is much more skill to the game with very little randomness/luck and it does have a learning curve to it.  You had better bring your calculator b/c there could be loads of calculations during merger the bidding rounds.  Everything you do and all your choices have a cumulative effect going forward.  A good player could shift to different strategies but mostly early on.  It's not rocket science but it is very involved and it's a tension-mounting business game that escalates to the end (where the final round has double income for everything).  Things build up (acquired) quickly in 1st & early half of 2nd Era, where having most income is important.  Then, the game usually climaxes with a few major merger combos somewhere in the 2nd Era onwards and probably a couple more in the 3rd Era.  How much should you bid for that newly merged company?  Which companies should I initiate merger with?  Fortunes can be made or broken during the 'merger phases'.   Fascinating thing about Indonesia is that it has played differently every time I've played it so that speaks volumes to it's depth and replayability.  Top notch components.  If Indonesia is adminstered by an experienced player, this should play in about 3 hours (more with heavier analytical types).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Bring a calculator...this game involves a ton of math.  First couple turns move along relatively fast but the ending couple rounds get very fiddly and can take a while delivering all the goods.  It definitely seems very important to aquire a production company in the first round as opposed to the merchant ships unless perhaps you're the last player and can dictate some terms.

This is heavy economic Euro where you are building business in Indonesia.  You are trying to merge businesses and grow them and deliver goods via shipping companies to cities.

When I first saw it on BGG, [b]Indonesia[/b] didn't impress me. It looked and sounded fiddly and I had had enough of fiddly wargames in the '80s. Moreover, what could be more dull than an economic game on Indonesia - an economic game where "TV dinners" are a commodity. Are you kidding me?  But the more I read about it, the more intriguing it got so when I located a copy for under $100, I bought it. After playing a few times, I realised that it really wasn't as "fiddly" as I thought it would be. Yes, towards the end of the game, shipping gets a little confusing if there are a lot of cities and ships can ship multiple times from one company, and, yes, a calculator is nice to have when the bidding for mergers starts to climb. Over all, it's a great game and definitely in my top five now and probably for a long time to come.

This is a very interesting game with many tough decisions and interactions.  A lot of meat here and future evaluations that I have yet to get a good handle on.

---
With a third play this has declined from a 7 to a 6.  I would like to try it again but with 4.  5 just seems like too many. I also agree with the opinions that this game can really drag in the end game.  Also, watching a play sit and do nothing for a few hours because of a couple of early blunders is depressing.

I still think this is an interesting game, but I struggle figuring out how to evaluate the future value of a company well enough to play well.  In my 3rd game I ended up doing some clever mergers to monopolize the transport business, but in the process of manipulating the holdings of the other players I pretty much gave one guy the game, locking me in to a distant second place (although I was gaining on him by the end of the game, but only in small increments.  Again, interesting but probably not destined for my collection, given the current prices, and rarely headed for the table even if I had a copy due to the time requirements.

I just bought this and have only played it a few times, but what little I've seen makes me think great things.  Everyone affects everyone else with shipping, supplying cities, plantation growth, etc.  And for a game with no luck (well I guess there's a little luck with the city cards), there looks to be lots of replayability with different city positions causing different companies to be picked and grown.  I felt there were lots of in depth decisions without it ever feeling dry or prone to over-analysis.  I look forward to many more plays.

Indonesia es un juego para gamers, pero no es de mi personal gusto, porque el tablero se llena de piezas, haciendo que la fase de operaciones sea un trabajo más que un juego. Por otro lado, el tablero no ayuda en nada a facilitar la dinámica, porque los bordes son poco claros, las letras ilegibles. O sea, la forma, mala. El meollo, las operaciones de las empresas, enredado. Si uno es capaz de soportar todo eso, hay un juego bastante interesante detrás.

Indonesia is a gamer's game, but it is not of my personal taste, because the full board of pieces, becoming that the phase of operations is a work more than a game. On the other hand, the board aid in anything not to facilitate dynamics, because the edges are little clear, the illegible letters. That is, the form, bad. The marrow, the operations of the companies, romped and convulsed. If one is able to support all that, is a quite interesting game behind.

Other things irritates my eyes...

- wooden components (goods represents) are made for the 2 times big game board as there in the game...

Terrible - what should I think about publisher?

RATING: 5
03/27/10 Played a five-player game. 
The components - 
The good: 1. The player aid is adequate. 2. Overall there is a sufficient amount of money, though change had to be made with the bank quite often from mid-game on. They should have included some $20 bills instead of the $500's that really weren't needed. 

The not so good: 1. The components (cities & goods) are often too large for the spaces on the board. 2. The swirly font used for province names is impossible to read up upside down, especially since the words are obscure names in a country most Americans are unfamiliar with. 3. The board is the most drab I've ever gamed on. And it was often hard to see the demarcations between provinces. 4. Not enough wooden ships were included. Yet the number of goods markers seemed to be over twice as many as you'd ever use. 

I knew going in from watching the video review, that it wasn't going to be a type of game at which I excel; the pure economic game. For example; trying to figure out how much owning 9/13's of a $280 company is worth, or being forced to bid on a merger in increments of $7, is not something I find fun. Many on BGG called the game "mathy", and I agree, which is a turn off for me.  

All the mergers smacked of a stock market game. A game type I don't care for. I liked the "pick up and deliver" aspect more; trying to find the least costly route. But its still far from my favorite mechanism, as it reminded me of some train games I've played. 

I'd call Indonesia more of an "experience". One where you say, that was interesting. I'm glad I did it once. But I have no real desire to do it again. I do give it kudos for its original theme. There aren't too many games set in that part of the world, with the theme tied closely to the mechanisms. The length of the game didn't bother me. I'm used to playing long games. Though  playing a four hour game and never knowing how you're doing relative to your opponents is somewhat annoying.

Splotter's finest game.

PROS: 
* Excellent economic simulation.
* Good tension between players.
* Theme comes through fantastically.
* Amazing design.

CONS: 
* Runs a bit long for my usual preferences.  We haven't yet been able to finish a game in 3 hours.
* Bidding mergers is a little rough as you try to rightly valuate involved companies.  
* Board can be very busy.
* Lots of bits to manage.

This is one of those games that despite its issues I can't help but to love.  The game is exciting and the winner uncertain.

The game has excellent gameplay and doesn't feel like a long game while playing.  It does require a decent chunk of time, though.  The interesting mechanics are marred by usability issues for pieces.  Splotter is at fault for colour contrast and variety, hard-to-read text and impossible to see lines.  Some of the rest of the issues can't be reasonably solved without resorting to a computerized version of the game.  I played Clippers the same day, and Indonesia has many more and more serious production issues.  If it weren't a really good game, people wouldn't play it.  Much smaller than Roads & Boats.

An excellent pick-up-and deliver game where players control companies that either produce or deliver goods.  The companies can change hands during mergers.  It's an elegant design except for the crazy calculations needed for the bids (we played with a Javascript to perform the calculations, which I now see is a must).  I've only played once but I can imagine this game will have a long shelf-life as it's got a ton of depth and stategies available.  May end up as a "10" game with further plays.

I love this game. The tension in knowing that almost every move can cost you the game is just the best. Of course it's hard times when you sit through a session knowing you can't come back to win. But that is always to your own fault and that is what keeps you thinking about what to do better all week until the next game day.

My tolerance for economic / business games is minimal. This one goes on a bit too long, but it is not at all complex and easy to pick up. I even won, clearly the game is broken! I have no idea why this game is considered so heavy by the BGG crowd, it is very straight forward. Maybe they consider bidding in increments other than 1, 5 or 10 to be worth classifying a game as medium-heavy. Who knows.

If only the map wasn't so bad and the method for tracking which ships have been used was a bit better (maybe some extra tokens). The map barley fits some peices and the color is so dull. The game itself is amazing though and I'd play this anytime.
Splotter makes some real gamer games, but they are way to expesnive for what you get. It's really too bad that the community supports this crap. I won't be buying any more of their games until they realize that components matter for playability.

Some really exciting ideas particularly with the mergers marred by some component issues and some painful last rounds. I think I would be more interested in playing if I could find a group who played a game in the 3ish hour range. That's not been my experience to date.

RATING: 6
Fun economic game, though at times unclear as to how well everyone is doing and when the game will end exactly. A game can end abruptly in and rather anticlimactically in Age C after only 1 round.

Edit - UPDATE: very unbalanced game that can go totally awry at times. Hard to see what the worth is for many of the end-game transactions and in the beginning some players can get majorly screwed depending on seemingly innocuous decisions of other players - often beginning players with suboptimal moves themselves.

After 1 play: Interesting interaction between all the elements, minor things like city placement can really change the game.   I really enjoy the merging and city shipping limits.  I feel the end-game comes a little to fast.  However, it is a fantastic game all around and I hope to see more play.

RATING: 8
Very, very good, an interesting take on 18xx games. Mind-bending, but not so anxiety-inducing as Antiquity. It's also a lot more interactive. I really enjoyed the game, even though I lost my first game really badly.

Like other Splotter games, Indonesia has phases that require lots of careful chit-moving and will probably annoy some players - the shipping can get quite complicated and will take a lot of time when the game moves on. Patience and concentration is required.

On the downside, there are some usability issues with the map, figuring out the borders of the areas isn't always obvious. Probably not a big deal when you've played once or twice, but for beginners it can be tricky.

Suggest.

Very interesting game, but suffers from several issues:  lackluster board/art, some areas on board too small for pieces, some areas hard to distinguish (e.g., what areas are adjacent to others), so-so pieces, very high price for what you get.  A very complex game that bit off more than it can chew.  Puerto Rico does a much better job taking a relatively complex game play and making it accessible to players.  This game really makes you work.

Indonesia is Splotter's design philosophy at its finest. It feels like 18xx, feels like Age Of Steam, feels like Brass / Age Of Industry, etc... without being a damned thing like any of them. It's Splotter's take on financial swindles and economic / industrial development, and it's a doozy.

It might win the award for the worst map design ever and route-tracing seems considerably more difficult than even a late 18xx game run with a couple of 5 or 6 stop trains. It's positively rude, with players who have no interest whatsoever in "your" companies suddenly closing up "your" shop!

I felt like playing a prototype in its early version. This one is so expensive I expected to play a finished game. The concept of the game is good and the mechanics are OK (a mix between Acquire and Age of Steam), but I want to play a game not a concept! The board and bits are not functional. This game is just not worth of my time. I can have the same level of brain burning and fun with a lot of other german games without having to flip tons of product chits. I think that the authors could have reached a much cleaner design cutting the bureaucracy without sacrificing the level of interaction and strategy.

RATING: 8.5
Indonesia is one of the best Splotter games I have played. The board gradually builds during the game and the interactions between the players is tight and controlled.
Do not be afford to have someone merge your companies away from you....remember that the money they pay you is Victory Points!
I have only played the game with 5 players and at this number the game really comes alive with plenty of companies vying for trade around the board.
My only issue is the the factory ownership token should be coloured in the players colour so that you can easily identify them on the board.
RECOMMENDED.

I'm starting to think that the folks at Splotter are huge Brass fanboys that want to reinvent the wheel. This game isn't that bad, it's just a little derivative of other games in the same genre. Heck, I felt like this was the pre-cursor for some of their other games like Great Zimbabwe and Food Chain Magnate. I think I've come to the conclusion though that I'm no longer interested in Splotter games pre-FCM. FCM does pretty much exactly what all their other games do with a more appealing theme and cleaner rule set. As well-designed as Indonesia is, the math feels a little unnecessary, and the auctions feel very arbitrary. At the end of the day, I'd rather just play Acquire or Brass for this sort of experience.

Very nice shipping game with little randomness (yet it's amazing how much that little randomness can change the outlook of the entire game). This one takes at least one full play to understand thanks to some subtle rules and the overly mathy Merger phase. Only complaints are the fiddliness of shipping goods and the price tag ($120 MSRP. Ugh.)

Splotter game, 2-5 players


One of the most respected economic strategy games.

[i]
Judging by the smirk on the face of the Sultan of Solo, the businessman from North Sumatra has just made a mistake. And a costly one at that, too. He has paid way too much for merging his rubber company with the Sultan’s extensive rubber plantations: there are no ships in the area to transport the rubber to the booming cities of Java. And the Sultan is now dripping in cash — he can bribe city authorities so that his ships will gain preferential access to those ports where they are competing. Or he might invest in building an oil imperium. But wait — what’s that young fellow over there up to? Buying all the shipping lines? That might change the outlook … considerably, in fact … let’s see…

Indonesia is a game in which two to five players build up an economy, trying to acquire the most money. Players acquire production companies, which produce goods (rice, spices, microwaveable meals, rubber, and oil), and shipping companies, which deliver goods to cities. As cities receive goods, they grow, increasing their demands. Production companies earn money for each good delivered to a city, up to the city's capacity, but they must pay shipping companies for the distance traveled, even if they end up losing money. Players can research advantages, like greater shipping capacity or the ability to merge companies, possibly stealing ownership of lucrative plantations or shipping routes by buying out other players.

Players keep their money hidden, trying to accumulate the most by the end of the third era. When only one type of a company is left, an era ends. New eras bring new cities, companies, and types of goods. At the end of the third era, the player with the most money wins. However, money earned from the last round of operations (selling/shipping goods) counts double, so it can be important to control the timing.[/i]

I really liked this game.  The calculations can be a bit of a turn off for some players.  That really doesn't bother me that much, but I can see this being a problem for others.  I'm a tad worried about the replayability of it, as the companies are positioned the same from game to game, but I believe that there are enough options throughout the game to counter this, I'm hoping.  I would love another shot at this game.  Can hardly wait.

Gamer only title. Very nice system, tough tactical and strategic decisions - which company to acquire initially, what development to pick, when to merge companies, which companies to merge, where to expand, when to buy other players' companies, what companies worth defending, what the order of company operations should be. My only complaint is that the operations phase takes too long in the second half of the game due to increased deliveries and more complicated delivery routes and that slows the game down considerably, which takes away enjoyment per unit time. This almost kills the game for me. A computer version where players sit in front of a screen and the computer optimizes and marks the deliveries and calculates revenues would makes this game a two hour affair, but a face to face game takes 3 to 6 hours.

RATING: 9
Great combination of auctions, area control, and bidding. With several viable ways of winning, picking your strategy is important. A good shipping route can really give someone the game, but if you have well located fields, you can make serious money. Knowing when to merge companies is important, since you can grow a company then sell it off for a fair profit. The game really plays differently depending on the number of players. You really need to think about your approach each time you play.

I like that you are working against known quantities here. When merging, you can go overboard in trying to outfox other players, but there is usually an obvious point that people are going to drop at. A calculator helps with the bidding. Otherwise, everything is open. You know how many goods will be generated, and where they will need to go to. After turn order, you'll know whether you'll ship yours. Strategies are dependent on the number of players, and are not always the same, but are still good for any number. Randomness is minimal, only being where cities will be formed. otherwise all information is known.

Gioco della Splotter Spellen, probabilmente uno dei loro migliori. Il gioco non perdona per nulla e ho la sensazione che se uno prende il vantaggio difficilmente lo si riafferra a meno che tutti non si sia compatti nell'andarlo a riprendere o a meno che non si usino i mergers in maniera attenta e, a volte, devastante. Gioco di maggioranze, esplorazione e commercio dove i giocatori acquisteranno e espanderanno compagnie di trasporti e compagnie di produzione. Il gioco, che aumenta di durata con il diminuire del numero di giocatori, ha andamenti molto differenti a seconda delle azioni dei giocatori e delle scelte strategiche. Molto particolare l'ultimo turno che raddoppierà gli introiti incassati, questo aspetto da non sottovalutare determinerà probabilmente l'esito della partita. Gioco molto interessante che necessita di diverse partite per essere appreso al meglio.

Wow, what a game.  Only played twice now but can't wait to play again.  Manages to combine a few features of games I love.  Namely stocks, and being able to steal or lose a company you own based on bidding what your think the company is valued at thanks to the Merger R&D.

It combines this with selling and producing goods and shipping to different cities.  Making power plays on going first to be able to ship to places that are free, and keeping on your toes with competitors.

The game goes for 3+ hours but never drags, and easily feels like only 45 minutes.

Unfortunately the play time makes it hard to hit the table.  But I hope to play again soon.

Can't stop thinking, or wanting to play this game.  Plays pretty good with 3 people too.

Loses 1 point for the board design, which is a classic example of form over function.  The lines that separate sub-regions within the provinces are nearly impossible to see from across the table, and the fact that many of the areas are too small to properly contain the cities (glass stones) and prodution counters is also irritating.

But even with those graphical quirks, this is a fantastic game that melds a pick-up and deliver game with a very clever capitalistic financial model.  There are multiple paths to victory, and it will definitely take at least one game to start to see the subtleties required to properly execute any of them.  Long game that felt like it flew.  My only other issue is that the first era (there are 3 total) is over in a heartbeat and  feels a little different than the others.

This is the best of the Splotter games I've played. I thought Antiquity was too fiddly and Roads & Boats was good, but Indonesia manages to blend chaos and planning together into a spicy mix all its own.

RATING: 8
An interesting economic game. My only criticism is that the decisions in the operations phase are mostly automatic, yet take up most of the time, with players scrutinising the board to make sure they ship everything optimally. Especially the last 2 or 3 turns where the game can really bog down.

The bulk of the strategy is in the R+D phase, with the key tactical decisions coming in the merger phase. What you end up winning in the auctions feeds back to determine your strategy. 

Bidding for turn order is also a skill. Going first into a turn order auction is bad, and the last to bid is in the best position as you can bid most efficiently.

The two main strategies are shipping and production. The further apart the initial cities are, the better shipping will be, since if they are close together, ships won't earn much. In later eras, the big cities are likely to be the oldest ones.

Taking expansion is good for increasing the paper value of your companies early on, and later for saturating better industries (rubber, siap faji and oil) quickly. I think expansion 2 is mandatory for me (at some point). More than 2 is questionable, 5 seems absurb, though it might be a way to make money just by spitting out tiles for mergers. 

Turn order bidding is a function of production, since production defines competition. If you are the only player producing rubber, you don't care about turn order. If there are three of you, you want to be first. The bidding is strange since unlike most games you don't lose your bid entirely. My 1st game started out with conservative bids (c.20), but later over 100.

Money on hand is only needed for mergers and paying to expand. If you can't pay to keep your own companies, others will merge them away cheaply. This is bad. You get some money to compensate for your loss, but miss out on income. Note that the face value of a company is equal to it's income for one turn.

Early aquisitions will pay dividends, but all the money you bid will go to former owners (your opponents). Cash rich players have control of the auctions.

Merger 2 is also very powerful, but merger 3 does not seem that great as (in my experience) companies tend to pair up fast, and there are normally higher R&D priorities than getting to merger 4.

Fans of the business investment / merger / takeover genre will thoroughly enjoy the game, as I do. The third hour / third epoch introduces some brain-burning analysis and calculations to determine fair value of mergers though which is understandably a turnoff to non-fans. Still, this continues to get regular play for it's a gaming model different to other games in the genre.

Very heavy economic game but one that is mechanically very simple to play. The three hours listed to complete a game might be overly-optimistic. I don't think I've finished a game in under four hours and we play pretty quickly. This would be especially true with new players since it take awhile to explain the game. 

However, there is so much going on and interesting decisions to be made, I don't feel like it overstays its welcome and when we have completed a game, I've never felt bored or lost interest during the game. Sounds like an eight to me.

After first try: 

I own a few Splotter Spellen games, but this is actually the first time I have played any. 

I love the multitude of small pieces. The game works well and is fun to play. It seems a little unbalanced, whoever goes for shipping companies have an easier win. 

It's important to have a good idea about how much money each player have all the time. 

After losing shares in an auction you usually can get others for a bargain.

Indonesia is a stock-and-operation game that's unlike many stock games in that there can only be one investor in any given company.  However, this is offset by the game being full of mergers and hostile takeovers that cause companies to be handed from player to player many times within a game.  The game really forces players to evaluate the future value of companies at all times, which is roughly calculable given the number of rounds remaining.  However, those unwilling to crunch the numbers, or those without enough liquid capital to stay in the bidding will get trounced by those that do.  The operations phase is enjoyable in the beginning, but does tend to bog down once more and more factories show up on the board (and it's exacerbated by a runaway leader whose turns will take forever).  This is an interesting economic simulation that really feels unique in the gaming world.

Finally opened my copy of the game. Holy giant pieces batman. People weren't kidding :) While it sucks that those pieces are more or less unplayable, I've ordered a replacement set of wooden tokens. While not nearly as nice as the premade pieces, it'll have to do for the time being.

Fantastic economic game. Myriad decisions about how to make money here with a strong motive to screw other players by acquiring their companies through mergers. The components are lacking, and the board gets quite cluttered and confusing by midgame, but this is still a game of deep strategic gameplay with a lot of player interaction. I much prefer the deep gameplay and weak components here to some overproduced and pretty game with shallow gameplay.

Splotter always delivers and they've outdone themselves with Indonesia. I think this is the most interesting economics game I've ever played. 

Players take the role of investors with available capital and a strong desire to make a lot of money. The game starts with a virgin territory filled with opportunities: there are several suitable spots in the map where production companies of several different goods can be created which will need shipping companies to transport those goods to the cities where they will be consumed. Well supplied cities will grow and have bigger needs, making for new business opportunities.

As companies develop, they will merge with one another not only becoming bigger but also providing an opportunity for the other investors to purchase the newly formed company. This merger mechanic and the ability to take advantage of it is what will determine the winner but the whole game is packed with good ideas. 

The experience of playing a game of Indonesia is truly unique. It's engaging, there are a ton of tough decisions that can cause unexpected ripple effects hard to anticipate but no less challenging. There is no luck in the game and yet no two games are the same. 

I really like Antiquity but I think Indonesia might be my favorite Splotter game and one of my favorite games of all time.

I'm not generally a huge fan of economic games (ick, math) but Indonesia was still a great deal of fun. It had a familiar feel-- you are producing goods and shipping them to make money. The player with the most money wins! Plenty of decisions to make in the game and lots of strategy, so I liked it a lot. I can see where it would be bad for players prone to AP though.

The long playtime means this won't hit the table a lot. However, I'm very glad to have added this to my collection since I don't really have any other heavy economic games. As for other Splotter games, I liked Antiquity slightly more.... but Indonesia certainly has a better price tag!

The 2016 'revised' edition is worse than the original edition, in terms of production quality and component functionality, in almost every way.

(The gameplay remains fantastic, but it's disheartening that Splotter let its fans down on the production here).

I like the system of economic growth in this game, but I'm still wondering whether I like the game itself. It seems that the later rounds involve a lot of counting and administration, which doesn't really contribute to the fun. Also, I get the feeling that the bids for big companies are usually won by the person with the most cash available, which may lead to a runaway leader.

[floatleft][ImageID=311461][/floatleft]Indonesia is an economic engine building game that focuses on forcing company merges to benefit yourself at the detriment to others. In Indonesia players can pursue multiple avenues to victory but must remain versatile in case of hostile takeovers. The board art looks amazing but sacrifices some functionality in certain areas. I enjoy Indonesia for its heavy economics and cutthroat nature.

RATING: 7
Indonesia is a fascinating game where players establish production companies and shipping companies, and then send their goods around to cities on the islands. For each good sold, the player who made the good earns some money, but has to pay the shipping company they used. The game is rich with different strategies, and the most glorious stone in it's crown is the way you can declare a merger between any two companies to combine them into one, under single ownership. There's a lot of depth here and this is the sort of game that sticks in your brain long after playing it.

The fatal flaw is the downtime. During the shipping phase, a lot has to happen. Each good from each company has to be shipped. This just takes a lot of processing time, without any genuinely interesting things to think about or decisions to make.

This is a solid game. Very involved, you keep an eye on everything everyone else is doing all the time. Other players can really screw with your plans which makes it very fun.

There are only a few reasons I hesitate to give it a higher rating. One, it takes so long to play, our first 4 player game was 6+ hours. Two, its very exclusive since its expensive to buy and limited in copies. Three, while asthetically pleasing, its not functional in game play. The parts are on the cheaper side (cardboard chits easy to ruin/peel, and what is with the money!!??) the map is not precise and too many ambiguities remain. The choice of 3 colours and 2 ship types is puzzling. These are nagging little things that get under your skin. The rules are not well written. For the money, I think we should expect and deserve more. Now gameplay, is very nice which is what its about I suppose, thus still a high rating.

Board is far more attractive than functional. Text is hard to read, lattitude/longitude markings confuse reading the province area boundaries. Sea spaces and shorelines layout make determining adjacency difficult. City glass jewels look nice but aren't very functional once many resources start arriving at each (can't stack em on top).

Play mechanics are intersting but gets fiddly and bogs down in the last phase (c).

RATING: 8
One 5-player game where there was a lot to integrate but not really difficult to play. Game only lasted 5 round and was over quickly (easy 90 min. after the first playthrough). The board did not fill up and was cluttered during some segments of play. The map could well have been twice as big. The map gridlines, while not affecting the game, did affect play in making some of the area boundaries confusing. The so-called math issue is actually very simple. Need to explore less 'balanced' R&D strategies to investigate the potential paths to victory. Pure shipping will be difficult to have in sufficient numbers and hull spaces to win. Also need to look into ways to slow the leader. Beware of winning third era mergers that will never have the time to recoup the cost. Well worth additional playings but a personal copy comes with a price tag not warranted by the components themselves.

An excellent trade development game.

It has half the rules and half the game play time of 18xx games.  There is a vast range of ways to play and what to do each turn, so the game play is even meatier than 18xx.  And the replay value is very high.

A really excellent gamers game.

It's a solid economic game with a lot going on, incredible depth. The map of Indonesia is quite accurate and very thematically transforms into a land with plantations with ships ready to take them to cities.

I'm not sure if I'll play it enthusiastically as most of it is reduced to being good with numbers. But for economic game lovers, this is gold.

I really enjoy this and look forward to exploring more. You start with a few small companies with limited reach, then the world changes as companies expand; some companies may merge with others, and if you're clever you may control the resulting merger, or perhaps your cleverness will result in a cash payday as you unload one company to go after another; the cities where you deliver may grow their demand; new industries spring up, old industries may merge to something altogether new, and in the course of time the small areas you started with have expanded to empires across the map.

The upside:
-What a perfect storm of a game. It only took a play to be one of my favorites.
-So many things to appreciate: The art is amazing, the map gives so many options, there's several types of goods to produce and ship, you can create and merge companies, cities that grow and change demand, a tech-tree to make your strategy invincible and an hollywood-esque pacing throught all of it with a big ass explosion at the end.

The downside:
-The last turns can be painfull with all the waiting around for everyone to do their math.
-Some issues with the readability of the map.

Indonesia feels much lighter than I was expecting.  I think it is because the player aid actually helps guide the game and reminds you about the good prices.  

The mergers mechanic is very different from any other game I've ever played.  I like it because when you lose your company through a merger, you get a tidy sum of money which you can use to throw your weight around and get the company that you want merged.  Or you can keep the money.  It's also unusual that the companies themselves don't have a specific value, and that you don't have to pay for them when you first acquire them.

The turn order mechanic is really neat.  I think I will need a few more games to see what kind of impact it has. I doubt that it has as much impact in a three player game as in a five player game.

The only part that was unpleasant was remember how many ships had shipping capacity towards the end of the game.

RATING: 9
Could easily become a '9' if I can get more plays out of it.  Strange kind of economic game which my accountant friend 'got' instantly, so it clearly models some key real-life principles.  Definitely a brain-burner, and very fiddly when you get into later ages and are trying to figure out ways to maximise your profit while not paying more for shipping than you have to.  In all this, it's one of the best new games I've played in a while.

EDIT:  Update.  Yes, this is easily a '9'.  Great game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Played twice.  The first game players were a little shy to initiate mergers, so the game was pretty much decided on how profitable was each company was that players drew. The game was fairly static and the player (me) who controlled the best shipping company ran away with the victory.

The second game was anything but static.  One the first turn, I decided to try getting mergers going right off the bat in order to generate quick powerful companies.  My strategy backfired a bit because on the two mergers that I really wanted to control, I had less money than the other bidder.  I thought I was out of the game, but all the cash that I generated through selling my companies turned out to my benefit in the mid game by being able to start the first microwave dinner company.  This company quickly launched me into first place and gave me the victory.  

If Indonesia is played as company vs company, it is not a great game.  The interesting part of the game is in the mergers where profits can be created from nothing or super companies can develop.

Edit: This game keeps getting better and better!

PNP!

Beautiful game, design and play.  Its a company managed, investment game with emphasis on hostile take-overs and financial gain.

Make your money by running production and/or shipping companies, or by selling them.  All purchases are divided perfectly into ownership of shares.

Find yourself low on capital due to poor production, delivery or too much tucked away in the bank and you'll find yourself without a belt during the next crucial merger.

We use a calculator (silent bidding), particularly for bidding increments to keep the pace of the game up.  We set up the calculator so each time equals is depressed one bid increment is added and the calculator just gets passed around the turn order.

RATING: 8
This is a solid and satisfying game.  The first two thirds of the game are brilliant.  The last third becomes a little fiddly as shipping routes proliferate and lengthen; but more critically the exact value of everything can be calculated given enough time.  Logical with a lot to like in it: drama, tough decisions, growing empires etc. The decisions about R&D and mergers are the critical and interesting ones.  Playing time is relatively independent of the number of players and is about 3 hours.  I am not sure how to fix the endgame "problem" (it works, it just isn't to my taste) - you may just need a timer if you have slow players.  The 3 player games seems less stable than the four player - there are fewer cities out and it seems that this can make one company much more powerful than the others and put its first turn owner in a great position.

After ~4 plays.  Very clever system with many non-obvious relationships.  
Downsides: Far too few boats (for a game of this price, why couldn't they toss in another 3 or 4 boats of each size and shape) and map is very hard to use.  Fancy script font on map looks pretty but is very tough to read.
I hope publisher comes out with an easier to read map.
EDIT: I figured out a reason that I always lose this game.  You are rewarded for making _inefficient_ trading routes with your boats.  This is so alien to me it took a long time to wrap my head around it.  

When I learned this I lost some interest in the game.  Being deliberately inefficient rubs me the wrong way.  Also it mis-educates people about economics.

A gem of a business game. Unique and interesting game mechanics with high fun factor and tense game play which all comes together for a fufiling experience. The only thing is the heavy accounting and calculations needed could put some people off. 

One of  the best business board game systems with mergers and acquisitions well weaved into the game play. It's such a waste that this game system is not further developed upon or expanded with new maps and scenarios. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Overall a good game.  I would rate it higher, but it basically is just a game of waiting until someone merges some companies that you don't want, then you jump in and merge their company with your own so you can get it cheaper.  That and a bit of logistics with city placement and shipping lanes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very complex and heavy economic game. I really like the merger mechanism, which I have not encountered in any other game before. It can be used to make your own companies bigger, take over opponents' companies or even to concentrate supply such that it overexceeds demand (turning rice & spice into siap faji).

I also like that this is a pure economic game. By this I mean that the goal is to achieve the most money and not that money is just a ressource and the goal is to get VP.

Logistics and the map play an important role in Indonesia. The map is really beautiful and I had no problem reading it (there are only 3 critical spots). I share the criticism that the operations phase, in which there are in comparison easy decisions to be made, is very fiddly and time-consuming. Indonesia is in the following sense a real heavy-weight: As a beginner you cannot foresee the consequences of some actions, especially mergers. I think it is absolutely amazing that a game with this much freedom in gameplay is in not broken and does not go off the rails.

This game is quite regularly played at my local club, but I only played it for the first (and so far only) time myself in September 2014. It's not the kind of game I love, so I don't think I'd ever request it - but it was both interesting and fun nonetheless. In many respects it reminded me of the 18XX series (which that gaming group are also very into, but which I personally find very boring), but with many extra bits which made it more "gamey" and much more interesting - principally which technology (or whatever they are officially called) to advance on, which always seemed to be a tricky decision.

[u]The Positive:[/u]
(+) Dynamic player interaction: some players produce goods, some players transport goods. Production and transport firms need each other in order to make money, but can also have different agendas. Mergers between firms also create a fascinating opportunity for player interaction.

(+) The merger mechanic is original and really interesting. It is amazing what a right type of merger can do: it's not only about obtaining the right firm, it revolves around much more. Maybe you need cash to invest in some other sector? Maybe you want to influence which region of Indonesia will get developed further by obtaining a transport firm? Maybe you are willing to sacrifice one of your firms to protect another? Maybe you want an opponent to lose a firm to another opponent? Maybe you want to change the capacity of a transport line? ...The possibilities here are astonishing. The merger phase is a great opportunity to lay a trap for your opponents. Setting that up and ensaring one of your opponents in it feels so rewarding :)

(+) Indonesia offers a wide scope of possibilities to players: you can approach each game differently. Will you focus on producing expensive goods close to cities? Will you focus on developing transport routes? Will you try to balance between the two?  When things don't turn out the way you want, will you start some strategic mergers to get rid of your own firms and acquire others? ...


(+) Indonesia offers an excellent balance between strategic and tactical play. It is important to set out a strategic line for multiple rounds in the future: in which type of research do you have to invest? To which seas will your transport firm expand, allowing for future development of the board there? Which firms are interesting in the long run, which will become less interesting? However, the game rewards players who keep their eyes open for tactical opportunities which constantly arise and invite players to change their strategic line and become even more succesful.

(+) The game grows in an interesting and balanced way. The economy literally grows  with rising demand when cities get fully supplied and rising supply as succesful firms will expand and increase production. Later in game more profitable goods (rubber and oil) become available. The places on the board were production facilities and cities become available is in large part controlled by the designers in order to create interesting gameplay situations. This way, even when the game starts out small at first, players are immediately in the middle of the action to build up a growing economy.

(+) Compared to other Splotter titles, I get the impression Indonesia is less punishing to players who make an initial mistake. Overstretching yourself in a fierce bid can be a costly mistake from which it can be hard to recover and when you are not careful, a mean transport company can strangle a production firm with excessive transportation costs, but such excesses are rather rare. In Indonesia players never totally drop out because the game offers many interesting possibilities which are free of charge (starting a new company, doing research, expanding when you sold out, placing a new city (=demand for your products) at the start of each era, ...) and because clever mergers allow players to fall back to their feet. The game certainly rewards clever play, but at the same time I find it not too harsh on players who lag a little behind initially... (that being said, do keep in mind that this is a Splotter game with a less restricted scope than a typical euro game, meaning there are no catch up mechanisms: do not expect a friendly game towards players who fail to set up their stuff correctly).

[u]The Negative:[/u]
(-) This is a pretty fiddly game with some unclear map areas (even in the 2nd edition the game would have benefited from a more practical and stylised map), small cardboard tokens on even smaller map areas, ... Generally this game lacks some 'overview'. Also in some merger-bidding rounds, players will probably want a calculator to make the right bids and assess bids made by opponents.  There is no way around the fact that this great game will get on your nerves with its fiddliness at some point or another.

(-) Indonesia forces production firms to sell as many goods as possible. This is a great rule that forces players to be careful not to be forced to ship too many goods too far away, inducing impossible shipping fees: it keeps things exciting and is a corner stone mechanic which keeps the whole thing interesting. However, due to this, the operations phase involves some dull calculation to find optimal routes to cities. This is comparable with 18xx games, but in such games you can often use an app with a routing algorithm to do this dirty work for you. In Indonesia it is up to the players to track all routes keeping shipping capacity into account and calculate income and expenses which, especially in the 2nd half of the game becomes a time consuming chore.

(-) The 2nd edition suffers somewhat from production mistakes or poor decisions. For example: the wooden counters are too large and there is the unfortunate choice of symbols (why did they change the clear symbols for the different good types from the first edition?). However, the game is perfectly playable with these components and some improvements certainly have been made (the map is a little more clear with better borders around certain sea areas, the carboard ships allow players to put transport expenses on the used ships which becomes handy in the 2nd half of the game to see which ships have been used already). All in all, this is a minor complaint.

[u]Conculsion:[/u]
Similar to later Splotter games, Indonesia scores with a fascinating player-interaction: players often need each others infrastructure in order to make money, but at the same time the game offers a whole arsenal of opportunities to deal with your opponents. The game is characterized by the wide array of possibilities it offers players to approach this challenge, keeping things interesting: depening on which research paths you follow, you will have a different play experience. This wide scope of opportunities offers a less restricted game experience compared to classic euro-games, allowing players to write their own story each time they play. However, this comes at the cost of some annoying fiddliness not present in more restricted euro-style games and it puts a bigger responsability on individual players in order to build up a balanced economy. Players who fail to assess the correct value of a firm will have a hard time. In the end, that's what this game comes down to: seeing the right opportunities and assessing the value of firms in terms of perspectives and future profits, much like a stock picker would. Playing this game will require you to get over the pretty fiddly, dull and time consuming chore of calculating the optimal shipping routes for products and calculating the income of the the production firm and transportation firms involved. This is a key aspect of the game as it is important to assess the potential profit of a firm but with a bunch of tokens cluttering a not so clear map, this is a brain draining and somewhat wearisome job which will probably scare away many players. This is an aspect I dislike about this game, but there is such a wealth of gameplay elements to discover and play with here that I gladly overcome this issue. Despite its fiddliness, Indonesia probably is my favorite economic game for  3-4 players (with 5, I expect the game to take a little too long). 

[u]Tips, for those going in:[/u]
(*) Be rational during merger bids: if you bid, think about the perspective of this firm (How about current and future competition? How about shipping possibilities?) and the future profits you expect the firm to realize. Also note that it is not only about paying the right price, but also at the right [u]time[/u]. Being out of money or not having a company slot at the wrong time can be problematic.
(*) Try to be early in turn order and have free slot, especially in the first year of a new era when new possible acquisitions become available. The best firms are always snatched away early in an era.
(*) In the 3rd era no more transport firms come out. players controlling transport firms will decide which young firms will be able to ship and which won't.
(*) Rice producing forms run the highest risk of having their profits hurt by paying shipping fees (selling at only 20 rupees, you actually start working for the shipping company in stead of yourself if you need to deliver cities 2 or more ships away!). However, rice firms are generally positioned in the center of the map, closer to the cities. If you are a big rice producer: make sure cities close to your production fields get developped!
(*) Transport firms only earn 5 rupees per shipment and per ship, but keep in mind that ships are active in the operating phase of each and every production firm, meaning they can potentially generate income all the time. Production firms can only generate income during their own individual operation phase.
(*) Bold assertion to make, but as a rule of thumb you might say Indonesia will consist of about 10 game rounds (called 'years') in a 3-player game, fewer in a 4-player game. This will put a limit on your possibilities to do research and might help assess potential future profits for early production/transport firms.

this is a nice idea but too complex i think - it just takes too long and too much calculation to work out everything

it takes the interchangeable companies idea of 18xx and introduces turn order and shipping which just increases the complexity massively and i think unnecessarily

rating after 3plays (4pl) - 7+ - enjoyed it more this time - players played quicker and their was less conflict of companies and tf less calculation. which is typical i dont know but i think i wld only play this with certain ppl. oh but the operations round (as in 18xx) takes too much time with no decisions being made - this really annoys me

A nice business game with no hidden information.  (Some randomness in city placement, but since cities belong to all, not an issue.)

As others have mentioned - graphics are a non-issue as even in our first game we were fine after a turn or two.

--Jan2006-- Intriguing.  After one test-play with the 10 year old, I still don't know whether Chris Farrell or Mikko Saari will have the right of it in the long run.  For the moment, though, I'm eager to play again and learn more.
--Dec2017-- I've come to an accommodation with the cruftiness (it is pretty tedious to ship everything correctly; and particularly hard to do quickly) but really enjoy the game behind it all.   I'm happy each time it's got to the table.

I really like the idea of this game, but for me it falls into the category of being to large an undertaking for it's level of polish.  There are some really interesting mechanics here that work well together, and the amount of decisions that must be considered is, at times, mind-boggling.  The board is also a major mess.  By the time you have a full game in progress and are half way through...  it is very hard to see what is happening, and dolling out the deliveries and earnings can take longer than the actual player turns.  still this is a title I would like to play again, but will have to be in a very gracious mood to do so.

Another great game by Splotter. Really requires you to think about things in a different way. Mergers are intense and can change the game drastically. It can be quite difficult to know how to value a company. Still, there's a lot of freedom to try different things and there seems to be many strategies to discover here.

A challenging economic game where one must evaluate carefully the long-term value of different assets. Definitely advantageous to consolidate one's holdings and maximize what they pay off.

A heavy, rather long economic game with relatively simple rules. Tight money, considerable screwage in the form of forced company merger mechanics. Constant calculations of profits, expenses and required safety margin to avoid losing a company due to a merger makes for an intensive 4 hours. I am not a fan of bookkeeping contests like this, and I'm not likely to play again, but it is a very good game.

Puts the fiddle in fiddly. Although my rating is low there's some nice things going on and plenty of options on how to approach the game - mergers make things interesting. Unfortunately the poor board design really hinders play with the shear number of chits and boats that accumulate being confusing at times. At the end of the day it's hard to get past the hurdle that moving little cardboard bits around to this extent and for this long somewhat sucks the fun out of it. For the time investment I'd just rather play something else - quite a few other games in fact. (The same thing that put me off buying Antiquity.) It's certainly not bad, but nothing to rave about.

The beginning of this game is simply amazing. It packs an endless number of interesting decisions. If the game was somehow only played through the first 2 eras, it would be an amazing game. However, the end of the game really bogs down. Deliveries become complex in a tedious way.

I'm conflicted on this one. I generally like these heavy-ish games of juggling this to get that by way of this, while considering that. But after I was done (in only two hours, so don't be put off by the time), I felt that it was a perfectly fine game, but one where I'd experienced zero moments of FUN. It's somewhat fiddly, and has a nice looking map, with a moronic choice of font that chooses form over function. Would I play again? Yes. Will I ever suggest it? No. I'd much rather play Age of Steam or Amun-Re or Struggle of Empires.

RATING: 8.5
Is it a 'spreadsheet' game? Yes. There were a couple of spots where my friend and I were using the calculators on our phones to do some large number multiplication. Is it still fun? Yes. I played 2 player, so there was a lot more impact to the mergers and acquisitions than a 5 player game would have. In my play, a well-timed (and unexpected) acquisition stole the victory from my opponent and led me to a crushing last-round production x2 when I had been struggling all game long.

I mentally compare this against THE other Splotter game I've been able to play, Food Chain Magnate, and this is far more fluid and dynamic. By that, I mean that the accomplishments in FCM punish you if you are half a step behind an opponent and a single sub-optimal or poorly timed play can cost you the game in a cascading and unavoidable fashion. Not so with Indonesia. The R&D track is a great equalizer, allowing you to creep up from behind while holding your opponents back. You can adjust your strategy in Indonesia without inherently giving up the game by doing so. In fact, with the mergers & acquisition round, you HAVE to think on your feet and not squander your money on a single thing that may have some immediate benefits because you just gave up all of your possible defense against having your hard-built company bought out from underneath your feet. And that keeps things interesting, especially when the buyer has to pay YOU the appropriately valued portion of your previous ownership in the now-merged (or acquired) company.

It is also this payment between players that makes this a more forgiving game. In FCM, if somebody steals your revenue stream, it is an uphill battle for you to retake it. In Indonesia, you can get your original revenue stream back (eventually and at a cost), or move on to other revenue streams on which you are optimally placed or fortunately timed to pounce and claim as yours. This also ups the 'fun' factor when you can pull off an unexpected move and either win or still have a chance as opposed to knowing halfway through a game that you have no realistic shot at victory because your engine is suddenly without its pistons and will never fire again.

[1 play] This has cool ideas, interesting decisions, and good interaction between the players. The production value is excellent, although there are a few things like the map that need to be balanced more to function than form. It could get a higher rating from me if it was shorter and quicker, which could happen after the learning game.

Most recent play 7-26-08 with Michael, Donovan, Brian R, and Garrett.

Very deep, and lots going on, one of the best economic game I played.... loved my first try and looking forward to more play.. wish it was little faster and less fiddly with bits.

After second play, my appreciation is just growing, there is so much depth, and each little move that player makes changes the game so much.  I realised that I played few rules wrong.. So looking forward to try it again with the proper rule.

This is probably my favourite of long, heavy economic management game.

I'm not entirely sure whether me sucking at games like this is a consequence of or a reason for me not liking them. Seems like a chicken and egg problem.

In any case, I suck at them, and the problem is that there does exist something very close to player elimination. Fall behind at the start and there is just no way to catch up ever again.

And after that point it drags on for another three hours.

No, I just don't like it.

An awesome economic game with beautiful bits. A bit mathy, but I don't mind (some do). The merger mechanic is unique and I like that. There's a bit of pick up and deliver, too, which kind of reminds me of Giants (using other players pieces to move the moai).

There are two major issues with Indonesia. First, the mergers are rather tricky and hard to evaluate, especially in the first couple of games. Second, and more problematic, the shipping mechanic is extremely fiddly, even tedious. The game is also overpriced, but it might be worth a try if you enjoy heavy economic games and aren't afraid of math.

Nem sokon múlt, hogy elkerültük egymást, nagy kár lett volna! Ez a játék ütött, méghozzá nagyot. Már a szabálymagyarázat után éreztem, hogy itt valami nagyon komoly játékkal lesz dolgunk. Nem tűnt könnyűnek, de teljesen érthető a szabálya. Kemény gazdasági játék, azok közül pedig az egyik legjobb, ha nem a legjobb. Indonéziában kereskednek a játékosok. Termelőcégeket szereznek és azt egymás hajózási társaságain keresztül értékesítik a terményeiket egy-egy városban. Nagyon fontos a játékossorrend, mert egy-egy város csak adott számú terményt vesz meg. A játék csavarját az egyesítési rész adja meg. Bármely két vállalat egyesíthető, amiért bárki licitálhat, ha van újabb cég megvételére szabad helye. Nagyon jól kitalált a minden körben eggyel növelhető valamilyen tudásunk, amivel több céget tudunk birtokolni, többet tudunk terjeszkedni a meglevőkkel esetleg többeket tudunk egyesíteni, stb. Nagyon, nagyon jó játék az Indonesia, egyedül csak a kivitelezésbe lehet belekötni. A térkép néhol nehezen átlátható és lát az ember szebb játékokat is. De a kis kiadótól ez is szép teljesítmény, sajnos a játék ára sem baráti emiatt.

The game plays fine once you learn it but it looks so bad it is hard to get people to play it.  Played it once and I would rather play a game equally good that also looks nice on the table.  This game is expensive and the components look like they are from a $20 or less game.  Will not play again unless they do a release for it like Brass just did.  Game itself is about an 8 but the art and components are a 2 so I averaged out and bumped it based on the game being good.  If you don't mind ugly then you will probably enjoy.  A little to much math for my taste.

Who would have guessed such a lovely system would be packed in a box of chocolates.  This is another exquisitely meaty game that there just aren't enough of in our little gaming world.  Fans of the 18xx system should enjoy this extreme variation of the theme.  

The malleability of the game is pretty astounding.  Because of the differences in the placements of cities, and the variability of the R&D track, the game forms is such different ways. Every game I've played has felt very different.
 
The merging system is conceptually mind blowing.  I'm surprised at how successful they had pulled it off.  Even still, the calculations prevent this game from being accessible to anyone but the most devout gamer. 

The board is beautiful, but barely functional.  My only real complaint is regarding the boats.  I wish they hadn't picked primary colors, they could have picked the secondary colors they had for the players and it would have looked much more beautiful and the gorgeous board.  That and the mix can at times become functionally difficult.

The more people that you have the faster the game gets (perhaps too fast). I'm a fan of the game with three players as the game has a longer development arc, but with four it progresses at a steady rate.  Those not capable of putting in the hours should play this with four.  I have no desire to play this with five.

So much going on in this one.  My only major complaint with the game is that the components are a little wonky -- the game would work a little better with a better-drawn board where the commodities were a little more apparent.  Additionally, the chits are a little over-large for the space on the board.  When we played, we substituted the commodities with the small cubes from Wallenstein halfway through the game, which made for a bit cleaner play.

RATING: 9
A bit like an 18xx game, but fiddlier and much prettier to look at. The abstraction of city values is replaced with a complex pickup-and-deliver mechanic, while the whole stock value mechanic is streamlined. I hope I'm able to get this to the table often enough to really grasp everything that's going on--it is a bit long for some folks. While I agree with the many who have said that the map is difficult to make out at times, but I find that it's good-looking enough to be worth the extra trouble.

Indonesia is a beautiful, well designed game, but the operations phase is not fun. It's just tedious. Is it enough to ruin the game for me? Pretty much.

But the operations phase in Indonesia really bogs the game down. The activity takes away from the fun instead of adding to it.

A little disappointed after my first play. The final turns were long and subject to AP. The decisions one makes have Kingmaker implications. Mergers seemed not really worthwhile, except for the shipping companies. Many R&D choices seemed constrained to one or two options (although that changed) throughout the game. And the rules were a little unclear in places. I think the map is gorgeous, though.

Definitely my least favorite of the big Splotter titles. It may just be that I don't like economic games, or that they take multiple plays to become interesting, but it seems that there is an awful lot of "accounting" that goes on between the main decision points of executing mergers. I think that shipping your goods is far too much micromanagement and the game ultimately is too long for what it is without facilitating enough simultaneous gameplay. I'd like to play it another time or two before solidifying the rating, however.

Indonesia was my first foray into a Splotter.  It was somewhat disappointing. I'm glad I got to play, but the combination of an awful, unhelpful board and excessive length doom my interest in it. The economic system is neat and there are butterfly effects everywhere, but I think the 18xx series offers enough of what I like about Indonesia and less of what I don't in a comparable amount of playing time.

In my play I went with a shipping strategy (which is quite passive) and it didn't ramp up quickly enough. Had the game lasted another round, I would have fared better in the scoring, probably placing second rather than second last.  Unfortunately, I would not have made any more decisions.

This is a very good economic game! You get to run 2 types of companies (shipping or production), and have to determine their market values as you merge them together and auction off the result. You can invest in different types of research which all seem viable routes to victory: slots, to acquire lots of companies and run them all profitably; mergers, to combine companies together into stronger companies, control the pace of the game, force people to spend their money; hull, to improve your shipping companies and leach money from all those production companies; bidding, to stay ahead in turn order and ship your precious goods first. It has a hint of an 18xx feel, but is really quite different (except for the fact that you're operating multiple companies, one at a time).

But it's not all perfect. The map, while very pretty, is also kind of annoying: hard to read the text, some spaces are too small for the tokens, and some border markings are not very clear. The game is also quite fiddly -- but not as much as Antiquity! And there is a LOT of math! Calculating legal merger bids, and dividing the bid up appropriately, is kind of a pain ... good thing there are spreadsheets and player aids to help you!

After years of owning the game but not getting it to the table (beyond that first play or two), I'm very glad it is (soon) available for play-by-web play at slothninja.com! Now that I can play it more, I suspect my rating might go up a bit (and it was already a 9)!

Have played once and it was more of a learning game.  I didn't understand too much until it started clicking in about 2/3 of the way.  I would like to try it again before assigning a rating.  Update:  I find it boring, and when a boring game is 3-4 hours long, it's painful.  I usually don't care much about appearance, but here it is so drab and unappealing that it actually leads to some confusion and the rules are confusing enough by themselves.  Due to its length, it's one of the few games that I hope never hits the table.

This is an excelent game. It's kind of a shame that it isn't more playable. The thing is that the board is a mess, the components and its functionality are very poor. I like the stones for the cities and the wooden bits but they simply don't work at all. Plus, the way players have to read the game, deliveries and boats capacity just don't work. 

The game itself though has lots of difficult choices, it's very well balanced and also very original. I wish it was better made. It's one of those cases where I have to downsize its rating dispite the quality of the game and just because it doesn't work.

Indonesia is a clever "trading in the Mediterranean" game in which players are building their corporate empires by buying and merging companies, exploiting resources and selling them to maximize profits.

This is a first-impression review.  I know a game of this depth deserves more than one play before it is rated, but screw it, this is MY first-impression review!  So my first impression is:  UG.  LY.  I don't think I've ever seen a less attractive game.  And most of the bits, with the exception of the city and ship markers, are very poor quality.  Even worse, the board and the player aid sheets are probably the least functional of any game I have ever played.  I was going to go into specifics, but it would take me far too long to go over all the problems.  So let's move onto game play.  After the confusion of the first couple of turns, I settled in nicely and started to enjoy acquiring new companies and trading my goods over the next couple of turns.  Then the mergers started.  And I found myself thinking that the game could be a lot of fun if it weren't for those mergers and the wild swings of fortune that came along with them.  But the problem is, the mergers are the heart of the game, and certainly the most important part of its strategy.  So you can't exactly get rid of those.  And I can't exactly give this game a very high rating, despite it's apparent popularity on this web site (Edit: Apparently I gave this game the same rating I gave Monopoly!  Oooo, burn!).  And the kicker: I actually won my first game, despite not having much of an idea of what I was doing (which further lowers my rating, rather than increases it)!  Game design: 1.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 1.5/5  Total: 3/10

Ooooh, a hard one to rate. Unusual heavy economic game from Splotter with gorgeous graphic design (though, in practice, a triumph of form over function). 

Players acquire companies to produce different kinds of goods, which are delivered cities with limited demand. A city which is saturated by goods increases in size (i.e. increases demand); a company which delivers everything it produces expands. Delivery isn't free, however: the shipping companies charge 5 per good per space, so a rice producer forced to ship over 5 boats will end up paying more to the shipping company than they keep.

Company operations, then, can be painfully tense: if two competitors have access to the same market, whichever operates first will satisfy demand, and if the other can sell at all it may have to pay through the nose to do it.

Perhaps most interesting are the mergers. A player who has developed along the merger track can propose that two companies be merged, either to form a single larger shipping company or producer, or (in one special case) join a rice company and a spice company to produce a manufacturer of microwave meals. Profits from the sale are split between the original companies based on their respective sizes -- but anyone with space for another company can bid.

Merger bids are difficult because company valuations are extremely unstable depending on operating order (and, in the case of shipping, the hull capacity unthematically linked to the player rather than the company). Moreover, winning one merger can deplete your funds enough that someone else can merge one of your other companies away from you -- perhaps giving you capital and the capacity to arrange another merger... Proposing a merger you hope to lose as a revenue raising exercise is a common strategy.

In play it feels somewhere between a pick up and deliver game in the Steam family (turn order critical, track ownership, limited demand) and an 18XX (companies changing hands). 

My chief complaint is that managing the shipping is fiddly and tedious, especially in era C when several companies will have 10+ goods. It's like late 18XX operating rounds, except the wrinkles of demand mean you can never say "same money as last time; next". This is not a minor complaint: it is painful and unnecessarily drags out the game. 

tl;dr: great game with just a tad too much fiddly downtime hell.

[Splotter 1st 2005 edition] {Economic; bidding, variable-player-order, development, pick-up-delivery; optimal 4p} Indonesia is a thematic economic game.  One of the few games that winner is determined by who has the most money.  It is interactive and fun - it is usually enjoyable to acquire other companies.  It is a multifaceted game.  Players can choose different strategies and can adjust them flexibly during the game.  It is really good.  One key point is that maintaining good cash flow is quite important; otherwise, one will face hostile acquisition from other players.

Indonesia nevertheless has some problems.  AP may be a problem but a game turn is not really long.  It is quite fiddly (but already better than Roads & Boats).

The rule is lengthy and it takes a game to fully understand and clarify the rules.  However, it is still a well-organized rulebook.  Players need to pay attention to some details, which is not intuitive enough at first time. 

The components are quite good, similar to other Splotter games.  However, there are several problems.  The board is too busy to distinguish areas. And some areas are too small to hold goods / city markers.  It makes everything jammed together.  The R&D track is too narrow and it is very clumsy to move the markers along.  The city card is too small and thin.  Finally, I don't like the color tone.

Good but not great game.  It's frustrating for the first several turns, then turn chaotic, which would be fine if the game were 90 minutes long.  However, the few games I have played have been more of a test of endurance, lasting upwards of 4 hours.  Furthermore, the merger process doesn't seem to used properly.  Several time I have seen the people high on the merger track merging companies, just becasue they can.  Not because they should.  This to me highlights the worst part of the a game of this length,   lack of control. Lack of control is not a feature I'm looking for in a 3 hour game.  I know it could be me, perhaps I'm not a good Indonesia player,  but regardless it's the feeling I have.

This is an extraordinarily elegant design that offers many layers of strategy and decisions. Time just flies by when playing this game, it's calculating and fun. 

The mechanics are interwoven so well, especially the collateral effects of the Merger rule. There is a problem in that players who fall behind are pretty much just along for the ride - the game is quite punishing that way.

We were aware of a few production glitches and fiddly issues, which were easily overcome.

Weighty yet somehow minimalistic economic game. A few minor production / rules issues mar the first playing, but once you've moved beyond these, you're coasting. Much less fiddly than Antiquity. Superficially not a game you can pull out & introduce to newbies, yet I did just that to a couple of my 18yo son's non-gamer friends, and they loved it.

There's obviously depth here, but I didn't enjoy this game.  The board is very poorly designed, with different areas being hard to tell apart.  It was never quite clear where pieces should go.  Most of the length of the game seemed to be not in figuring out what action to take, or in taking many actions, but simply in performing all the calculation required to resolve an action.  Bidding in mergers needed a calculator; trying to figure out values that needed to be in certain increments, then divided by other values, when working with values like 184 with increments of 9 was just an incredible hassle.  As a first game, its very possible we missed some ways of streamlining play or played some parts incorrectly, but I'd be reluctant to give it another try.

Stand-out economic/transportation game. Players take ownership of companies that are either concerned with the production of goods (rice, rubber, oil etc) or with the transportation of goods via shipping. The board comprises of a map of Indonesia, which has a number of cities located across it. These cities, depending on size, have a demand for goods and if this demand is met the cities grow in size and players owning companies involved in the supply receive money. Where the game stands out from other similar efforts is with the ability to merge companies via an auction system, whereby players can grow their companies making them more powerful. Success in the game centres around having a combination of companies that are going to provide a lot of income via resource supply each turn with a shipping network that other players have to use and therefore pay for. The board and components are somewhat impractical making playing the game something of a fiddle but this is a minor criticism overall as the gameplay really makes this a worthwhile economic gaming experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Played 3+ times: The rules and mechanics are quite easy to get the hang of;  Probably of a similar rules complexity to Age of Steam.  The game is also quite engaging with lots of room for clever play. 

Indonesia is great! The bits are a bit fiddly, and the board could be better laid out (It's dieing for a redrawn map) but it's only 6-8 rounds and then it's over. And those are 6 awesome rounds.

Each round you
0) possibly start a new era (populating the board with new cities and companies) The game has 3 era's and each era is ~ 1-3 rounds.
1) bid for turn order,
2) Declare mergers (if willing and able)
3) acquire new companies (for free) if you have a free company slot
4) get a free upgrade (new company slot/bigger merger capability/bigger ship capacity/etc)
5) operate the companies (Shipping companies expand their reach/ Production companies ship goods to cities and expand their fields).
6) clean up and possibly make cities grow

The hard decisions come from what companies to open and when. Is turn order important and how important. Where to grow and how much to grow. Whether to merge two companies (you don't have to be the director of either!?) and how much that merger is worth to you based on how many turns are left and where you are in turn order and finally what free upgrade to take because you only get 1/turn and you really want about 3 per turn. 2010/06/03

This game is the perfect example of how a game designer should not create a game. The map is totally inadequate for the gaming experience of consultation with major flaws. The cost is not supported by its value.
The game has an high level of interaction between players which raise the risk behind the influence over other player actions.

Based on one playthrough.
This game has some very interesting mechanics, especially the merging of companies. Do not get to attached to one company, because when companies merge, the highest bidder gets it. A really fun game, which requires a lot of planning and cooperation between players in order to get to deliver your goods for a good price. 
Very nice technology mechanic, where you advance one step on one of the 5 different tracks each turn, but my first impression is that everything looks really good to advance, and each different tech offers a different bonus on the game which you can take advantage of.
Much player interaction with companies that merge, cities that can only take a certain amount of goods each, and you always have to use boats to deliver the goods (which usually is somebody elses boats).
Overall it left a very good first impression, and a game that might be played a lot in my competative gaming group.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.6
Pick up and Deliver games just aren't my thing. Having to ship everything, even if at a loss is a dumb gamey mechanic and kills the game for me.

If I had resources to ship and I'd lose money for shipping it, I'd dump it instead.

The amount of fun I derive versus the time it takes, means this just isn't for me.

RATING: 9.5
Splotter's, deepest, richest, most intelligent and most interactive game. Every single decision you make impacts every other decision on the board for every player. Nothing is obvious.

A brilliant tapestry of dynamism and jockeying for positional edges. Mergers create ground-shaking game state changes instantly.

There is no game like it, anywhere.

I thought this one was fun enough.  It didn't knock my socks off with its gameplay or anything.  But it was fine and I enjoyed my playing of it.  I'd play it again, but I think I like Antiquity and Roads & Boats much more if I'm spending that amount of time, as far as economics, I'd rather play a faster game of something like Age of Steam or Power Grid in the end.

It would be a train game without trains. But the merges make the difference. You must estimate the real price of a company. Sometimes you must bid higher than the value of a company, because you could win nothing, but lose very much. 

Some problem with the game is the artwork. In the first game you don`t know where are the boarders between the regions.

Other problems: The R&D choices where similar. The chips are too big (or the place on the board too small). Usually after the biding we have a revers turne order (compare to the last round). Merges biding is sometimes not so easy (like when you can bid only multiple of 7).Would every game be different (the companys and cities comes on the board in similar places)?

[Edit] After second play raise the rating to 8, after third play to 9

From a mechanics POV, 'Indonesia' is probably the smoothest of all of the Splotter games.  Of course it's lovely spread out on the table, but what you expect?--It's Splotter.  Logistics, logistics, logistics with a healthy dose of buy/sell...  'Indonesia' features very deep strategic space to explore, and therefore rewards repeated plays in much the same vein as 18XX, though with important differences, too.

Can be a lot of fun, but there's a lot of downtime as people crunch numbers and figure out how they can work magic out of the boat system to deliver things to the cities they want. Then we seemed to constantly be changing 10s back with the bank since we were getting paid for large quantities in a bunch of little amounts and kept running out of money at the bank. Also, everone needed to fully consider the results of their actions for each of the 5 phases of the game. It just all adds up to make a game with 1.5 hrs of gaming time 4 hours in playing time. This is true some other Splotter games I've played and it does get reduced with repeated play and experience. Oh and I really want a rule to relocate boats. Especially when someone merges with your shipping company and you're stuck with their poor placement of ships before the merge. The board wasn't designed for the pieces you are suppose to put on it. Between the chits and the glass beads, some locations are so packed that the bits tend to cover up some of the areas that are free.

Long complex economics game. Fundamentally, there aren't a load of mechanics and rules to figure out - you can sit down and explain the rules in short order. What makes this great is that the player interactions and choices really drive the game and your choices. Unlike say ,PR, this one's slightly random setup of cities and the way they grow different from the start, instead of being one that falls into the "sameness" trap. Great game if you aren't playing with someone who gets AP or who spends all night trying to calculate the real value of something (which is hard, yet possible). 

*Update. After 4 plays, I'm beginning to think there may be a runaway leader problem. The first person to get into rubber and do well, or the first person to Siap Faji has a serious advantage. It might be playing with inexperienced folks, but it really takes an effort to keep those folks from overwhelming the game. Still fun, but it can really drag towards the end when everyone can pretty clearly see who the winner will be.

I was pretty much blown away by this game.  The three hours flew by!  I enjoy how the board fills up as the eras go by, and the decisions are tough throughout.  The mergers, and who can win the auctions, are very important to the outcome of the game.  Everyone needs to control some shipping or they are done for.

One of the two best non-18xx game I own along with Magic Realm.  Well worth the price and significantly better (IMHO) then the much heralded Roads & Boats.  Has the intense player interaction that R&B lacks.  Best with 2, okay with 3, terrible with more.


Rating only for Indonesia as she is played by my group.  We permit players to move one (and only one) adjacent space within a plantation when shipping -- this makes the game akin to multiplayer Go.  The actual rule -- permitting movement anywhere within in a plantation -- turns the game into tofu (sorry Splotter but that's the consensus with my group).  I'd probably give Indonesia under the movement anywhere rule a 4.

This is an interesting pick-up-and-deliver game with some nifty company merger mechanics, but I didn't find it to be stellar. And, with a play time that can easily top three hours even with experienced players, this would have to be far more compelling than it is for me to play it again. Indonesia is a good game that just doesn't justify the time expenditure it requires. I enjoyed the research tracks and the fact that ownership of companies is very transitory. On the down side, this is one of the most fiddly games I've played in recent memory, and the components are subpar. The game board/map, especially, is both ugly and poorly designed in terms of functionality, with division in regions poorly deliniated. I think this game gets high ratings from folks who simply enjoy a long, involved game, which it certainly is. But it's not a great game, so for me the length is a major drawback.

What a mind melter.  The rules aren't too complex, but there is such a myriad of options with almost every decision, and the cascading effects on your long-term strategy can be hard to predict.  In other words, typical Splotter.  Thumbs up!

Fiddly as all hell, though.  Tokens, tokens, tokens.

I hesitate to rate a game at which I am undefeated in three playings, because you never really know how much you enjoy a game until you've invested three hours into a losing effort. And really, once you strip away the tricky mergers, a tactic that my group still hasn't quite Gordon Gekko'd yet, the game is simply a grow your economy/ship your goods game laden down with a tad too many cardboard chits (but a admittedly modest amount for a Splotter game). Still, growing economies and shipping goods are two of my favorite things to do in a game ( you'd think I would have grown up to be a trucker magnate), and Indonesia provides me with ample opportunites to do them, so thumbs up!

This game is definitely good and I'm usually willing to play, but it very much depends on the group. This is a game I find only appeals to a specific group of gamers. It's heavy with a lot of math and the merging can be confusing to new players. It takes playing a new games before the entire process is clear even though there are only 7 phases per round and the new era phase only happens three times per game.

One other knock on the game is the component quality. Splotter has never been great with components, but this game's components are terrible. For the price I expected better. Also, the choice of red and green colored glass for cities makes it [very] difficult for red/green colorblind people to distinguish between the two.

A fun a variable game to start. As the game progessed it seemed to break down under its own weight. We had to spend most of out time doing math to divide up the price of merged companies or figuring out what could be sent where over which shipping lines for how much. In the beginning this was not bad but as it progressed it became heavier and heavier.

My third Splotter game (having previously played Bus and Antiquity).  This was a very enjoyable game.  Extremely heavy and involving a lot of math, but not as confusing as the rules would make it seem.  It seems a bit chaotic and unpredictable with companies constantly being merged and changing hands as a result, but there are so many interesting and difficult  decisions to make that the 3 hours fly by.  The components leave a bit to be desired, given the unreadable curly font and the lack of any method to identify which chits on the board belong to which company, but we used cubes from Caylus that did the trick.  I'm definitely tempted to pick up Indonesia or Antiquity, but am unlikely to pick up either for the time being due to the price and the fact that I can't decide which one I prefer.

Tremendous depth and richness of strategy. Lots of analysis, which does not seem to translate into much down time.

Indonesia is a deep game that lies around knowing the value of everything in the game.  Build up a great company, but be prepared to have someone else propose a merger and force the company into an auction you can't win! 

Knowing the subtleties of this game is important... How to expand quickly to be better situated in mergers, when to propose mergers, whether to go shipping, production or hybrid, how to make cities grow, how to force people to ship inefficiently... The list goes on and on.  But above all you have to know what each company is worth or you're sunk.  Because of that the game can get a little matey, especially on the last turn or two.

Indonesia is a sprawling economic game. It's as good as everyone says it is. The mergers are a wonderful innovation and is the thing that makes this game so special.

It doesn't have as much bite as other economic games and losing your companies doesn't hurt as much since you get paid out accordingly. Mind you, this just makes it a lot harder to work out when you're getting screwed and when you're not. It's subtle and it's amazing.

 Indonesia is a phenomenal business game with relatively simple and intuitive rules, yet game play comes heavy on interaction and depth. Mergers are the centerpiece here as they create a brilliant twist on company evaluation. The more I play this game the more I become convinced it is a masterpiece- no two games of Indonesia have been the same because the board develops differently depending on how players run the companies and where the cities are placed at the beginning of each era. 

The endgame can be a bit of a drag, which is the only thing holding this back from perfection.

Holy crap, but this is a great game.  I feel like it's almost necessary to learn this game from a teacher, not from the rulebook, but if you have to hack it out that way, then do it.  This is an agonizingly tight game, with loads of turn angst coming at every moment in the game.  The incentives are shifting almost constantly, and in order to stay competitive, players have to work semi-competitively while also working for themselves.  It's a wild balance, but one that works very, very well in the game.  Folks who like economic games that squeeze you in a vise will likely adore this game.

The game is not without its issues, but those are mostly in how the board and the pieces were designed.  It's playable as-is, but there are a lot of custom-designed pieces for different parts of the games (like the cities), and during our play, we discussed different ways we could clean up some of the design in order to make it a little easier to read.  Still, those are issues with the parts, and not the game itself.  The game is worth playing, however you can do it.

A very good game with good mechanics and difficult decisions with just enough conflict with other players. The actual production of the game could be better. Bigger board with more defined area and better pieces. But I look forward to playing this one again.

This is a very good game hampered a bit because production choices were made to forsake functionality for curb appeal. After playing a few times, the "looks first" production fades into the background though, and what's revealed is an excellent game. Read the rules questions in the forums carefully; the rules have a few finer points which are important to get right.

Very good economic game. Some usability issues on the map and a bit high maintenance near the end of the game, but the excellent game play easily trumps over these.

A good economics company where you have to think a couple turns ahead to keep the economic engine turning. There is also an area control component to it as you expand your plantations as well as a transportation component. The tough part of it is figuring out how much everything is worth.

I found this game to be fun, but there are several annoying gaps in the English rules that impeded our play. Also, while the components are attractive in many ways they are not very functional. Provinces/sea zones are hard to distinguish, ownership of company tiles on the board can be hard to discern, and the 6 shipping companies really should be in 6 different colors. One or two problems like this I would blow off. But taken together--and considering the game's high price--these many small issues really detract from the game.

Indonesia was already on my radar for a while, and Scott Nicholson's great video review of "Indonesia" pushed over the buying line. You can find his review here: http://www.boardgameswithscott.com/?p=17

I've played the game twice. The first game was with 5 Players and was a learning experience for all us.

It was well received by all Players except one. So we agreed to play the game 2 weeks later again.

This time 4 Players; I gave a short overview of the rules and we started playing. With 4 Players it took us 3 and a half hours. Time well spend!

What a game! Very tense, not only during your own turns but during the turns of other Players we all stayed focused.

The game-end was close; 3 Players had about 1700, 1500, 1200 Rupia. I had 940... I buy the game, write an overview, do all the explanations etc. and I play miserable... But I like this game :)

What I learned:
- Having your own boats with access to your production zones can be very helpful!
- Being the only Player with a Siap Faji company spells "cash".
- Without enough cash you'll loose good companies... mergers are very important.

This game - despite a longer playing time than the average euro game - will be played again! Recommended!

After one play, this is a really interesting game, packed with tough decisions.  When something goes wrong, you can usually see exactly where you messed up, but at least in one play, it didn't make future decisions any easier.  One of the most interesting aspects, to me, was how well the huge exchanges of property and money worked in the game.  You would expect that these huge transactions would radically change the landscape of the game each turn (and sometimes they do), leading to overwhelming chaos.  But instead it always felt controlled, balanced, and strategic.

By far my biggest complaint is the graphic design of the board.  It looks nice, but is very nearly unusable.  An extremely stylistic cursive font is used for city names which makes it all but impossible to match company tiles to their respective starting zones.  The designers themselves must have been aware of this, since they included map coordinates to help you find them.  Combined with the much more minor issues of lines that are a little too light, icons that are a little too indistinct, and territories that are sometimes a little too small and ill-defined, the whole board becomes a usability nightmare.  It's bad enough to affect the game experience, in my opinion, which is really too bad.

[i]Rating for the Print&Play version.[/i]

The game was just unplayable out of the box - the components were way oversized and the board was totally illegible. I find it unnaceptable, especially for the price. Fortunately my friend managed to print out a custom map from BGG resources and buy some additional wooden components that would fit the map. And I'm really glad he did, because the gameplay of Indonesia is just fantastic. I find the merger mechanism to be truly fascinating, it's unlike anything else I've ever seen in a board game. I love games in which players build a shared economy, it always creates a very interesting dynamic. 

There's one major downside to this game though - it gets really fiddly and forces you to constantly calculate your money and re-evaluate the state of the board (which gets very busy, especially at the end of the game). Keeping track of your shipping capacity late game is a chore. This makes Indonesia seem much heavier than it should be - I was mentally exhausted after we finished our first game mainly because of the fiddliness of the operations phase. Still, I think that the experience was worth it. It's a very intriguing design.

I really enjoy this one.  Can get a little long if you are playing with slow players, but it is straight forward with tons of strategy and decisionmaking.  My favorite of the Splotter games.  Less fiddly and more interactive than R&B and Antiquities

RATING: 7
A fine game, but genuinely surprised at how cheap the quality of the 2nd edition is.  It's not just the ridiculous error with the wooden bits; the cardboard is substandard, and even the box itself cheap and barely able to contain all the bits.  Couldn't recommend this as a purchase, no matter how good the actual game is, especially at typical Splotter prices.

RATING: 6.8
It's a very good game in its mechanics and I truly liked it BUT in the current iteration it's soo poorly designed that it stinks from afar. It's bordering unplayability: microscopic regions on a map with hair thin lines as borders must be filled with cheats and wooden blocks several times bigger. Really??? you, publisher, have you ever tried this game with this material?? it really amazes me how such a good game can be made unplayable with such poor decisions.
Not only material is poor but also the fact that you really have to manage so many bits and so many calculations! we had to simplify our life with a calculator to know how much to bid (seriously??). 
As a game itself is an 8 but after 7 hours of game with so much time wasted I can't but give slightly less than a 7. On a PC it would surely be a 8.

Provisional rating after one play.  (In which I came in dead last.) A no-luck game, so I can only blame myself.  I would suspect that most new players severely underbid during the turn order phase.  Even with two first timers I think we played in about 3 hours.

Played once (with 4 players). This game would obviously deserve more plays before I could get a better idea about it, but my rating after only one play is not that good. As usual with Splotter games, it is fiddly - but here the map is also difficult to read and confusing. Some mechanisms are not obvious to understand, and I know I should play it again in order not to remain on a wrong so-so impression - however, I'm not really tempted to do so.

Beautiful game. You may have no idea what to do in your first game, possibly nor in your 5th... The major issue is the map readability when it is full of chips and ships and keeping track to where the companies has shiped... Well I'll try to play without drinking beer next time. So far only played in 2pl and 4 hours games.

RATING: 7
Very open, free-form economic game.  Seems very dependent on how you use the development track.  Kind of fiddly.

This game has become, like Through the Ages, one of my "grudging eights".  I'm not good at it, and I don't understand how to get better, but after I play it, I can't stop thinking about it.  It's another game that I think if I played more frequently, I might be able to improve.

10/2/10:  Played for the first time in quite a while.  The game doesn't seem to scale to 5 players very well.  In that configuration, the initial turn order auction is probably too important and the number of actions per player over the course of the game is probably too low.

I've only played Indonesia online as it is quite the collector's item and even if I did have a copy it seems fiddly as all get out.  Trying to grow companies to be profitable while trying to find the best merger opportunities is very unique and interesting.

Like a couple of Splotter's other releases (Greed, Roads and Boats) the gameplay is intriguing at first, but by the time you reach the end of the game it's just tedious.

Very interesting economic game.  The mergers and company "slots" concept collaborate provide an unusual dynamic.  The board is lovely, with a graceful font.  Unfortunately, it's the Splotter standard of too much stuff having to go into the board's spaces.  Thankfully, it doesn't wreck the game by any means - just makes it a little tougher to play.

After 2+ Plays: I really loved my first plays of this.  I'm a big fan of heavy economic games, but I'm not very interested in ones based on a stock market, which seriously narrows my options.  Dealing with all the chits is a bit fiddly, but I'm willing to overlook that because of how much fun the game is.

A good and challenging economic game. The game excels in giving you a lot of options and in creating meaningful player interaction. It's a bit of a brain-burner, but it's certainly one of my favorite economic games so far.

It's a cool, very quick game suitable for children.
My 2 daughters can play it together by themeselves, which is always nice.

A game can be played in less than 5 minutes.

Batik Kid: a fun game that my son will actually play.

It takes the stacking mechanic similar in other games and forces the pieces to land flush.  This gives an interesting visual similar to slowly building an aquarium of sea creatures.  Great fun to watch and satisfying to play.  Repeat plays are fast so you can play three or four times in quick succession.

Szerintem kisgyereknek készségfejlesztő játéknak jó.
És amúgy tényleg 5 perc:)
Mi próbálgattunk különféle házi variánsokat is: pl. közösen meg tudjuk-e oldani, hogy ne lógjon ki egyetlen elem sem (sikerült!!! tehát szerintem hibás a játék:)). Másik az volt, hogy legalább hány elem után lesz kilógó elem (3 vagy 4 volt a minimum nekünk, nem is emlékszem).

RATING: 6
Fun abstract to play with kids - sets up and plays very quickly.  I like the "match" rules where multiple rounds are played - the piece causing the loss of each round is removed from the game until a round is played where one player runs out of pieces and cannot continue.  That player is declared the loser of the match.  Good stuff.

RATING: 5
Super-quick, if a bit repetitive even so. There's not much tension on the early drops - OK, so a piece bounced unexpectedly, but is that good or bad for me? Similarly, there's not much decision - it seems like getting rid of the big boat-anchors quickly is always the way to go. A few moves towards the end have interesting tension, which isn't much to recommend a game... but it's just so fast to play that that could sometimes be enough.

(It definitely looks neat.)

This is a nice looking light dexterity game. Like most Gigamic games, it's more a coffee table accessory than a deep strategy game. Imagine Tetris with Tangram pieces. (In the interest of fair disclosure, I got it for a dollar at goodwill -- If I had paid full price for it, I wouldn't rate it so highly.)

My brother gave this to my 3-year-old. At first I thought that was a strange idea, but the game's simplicity has proven me wrong. We have a nice time together with it. Of course my son isn't 'playing' the game so much as 'playing with' the game, but it's fast, easy and pleasant. It also has him manipulating the different shapes and seeing how they fall and fit together, which is a bonus. It will be interesting to see how his gameplay evolves.

As an actual game, it's great for being engaging on the table and super-simple to teach. The gameplay feels strange and random but rewards superior play (spatial awareness and constant tactical reevaluation based on the pieces left to play). It's a light game that requires genuine thought to win consistently, but most people play a few quick rounds and then say, 'Huh. Interesting. What else is there?'

Update: My kids have pulled this out a bunch lately, and I was rereading the comments here on BGG. I feel like this game doesn't get a fair shake. I'm rating it a 6 – so I clearly am not claiming it's Kris Burm's finest, deepest design. But there's certainly more to it than all of the people rating it 4 or lower seem to think.

RATING: 7
Greatest 2 minute game EVER... and the "tournament" rules (playing multiple games to find a final winner - loser of each game throws away the piece that causes them to lose... first player who can't play loses the match) make for a fine 10 minute game.

I already had the "adult" version, but Batik Kid looked too cute to pass up.  The simple yet exciting gameplay is the same, but the differences between the shapes create noticeably different patterns of play.  The simple geometry in Batik makes it easier to see how pieces can wedge between each other or cleanly fill a gap.  The sea creatures require a lot more guesswork.  If I had to keep only one, the aquarium of Batik Kid would stay.

Dropping pieces in this free-form way is super fun, it just turns out there's no game here.

Maybe if the channel were slightly narrower, so that the pieces were under too much friction to settle? In the copy I played, dropped pieces had pretty much total freedom of movement, and so would never create gaps of the sort shown on the front cover.

Yeah, I bet that's how it's supposed to work. Oh well!

An interesting little abstract game.  It looks more like a toy (normal reaction - "Oh, is that like Connect Four?") and is not attractive enough to be a coffee table game like Mark Johnson has discussed.  The idea of the game is interesting, though, and educational, as players can try to anticipate how a dropped piece will affect those that are already in there.

An amusing super-quick game where each player gets a set of flat wooden shapes which they take turns dropping, one at a time, between two mounted pieces of vertical Plexiglas. The vertical space quickly fills and the goal is not to be the first player who drops a piece that doesn’t fit completely. 

Not a bad way to spend 5 minutes.

This does look great, and the short game length on top of that makes it particularly inviting. What little strategy may have existed disappears when the piece you drop bounces off in an unintended direction. So it&#039;s more of an action game, a la Cheapass&#039;s Diceland, than expected. An enjoyable change of pace.

With a Connect 4 style frame, each player is trying to drop geometric shaped pieces into the clear frame with the aim of forcing their opponent to place a piece so it sticks out the top. This results in a loss.

There is some skill or strategy in there but on the whole it is not compelling enough to ever warrant going out and buying it new. A thrift store purchase perhaps.

So simple. Alternate dropping pieces in until a player puts one that sticks out the top, not being able to fit it in, chuck it out of the game, re-set and repeat, losing pieces at about 1 a minute until someone has to play and can't because they have no pieces left, whereupon they lose. After one game I can't tell if there's more to it than meets the eye in terms of what to drop and where so as to set things up so it's your opponent who can't place and not you, but for us it was a quick-playing and fun romp with a few laughs. Not often you get that in an abstract. And the pieces are nice and enjoyable to play with. Easily play again.

You know, I picked this up at a garage sale for about $1 and tossed it on the shelf, not really thinking much about it at all except that it looked like a Tetris clone and why would I want that in a board game. Without even playing it, I put it on my trade list. A year later, while playing Quoridor with my son I was looking through the Gigamic catalog and saw this game listed, which made me think about it again, which led to pulling the game out as another option to play with my little buddy. Several games later we were both giggling and asking for "just one more time".

It's a nicely made game...no surprise from this company...and it's easily the quickest filler I own. We had a very good time eyeing the pieces and the remaining space to see if we could, maybe, just squeeze in that one last large piece without losing. I'm hoping to get some more of this in soon to see if it holds up.

Most telling note: I've taken it off my trade list. :)

A very fast game - easy to learn and fun to play for a few rounds.  It's good to have this one around for the kids - it's easy enough for everyone.

Very good game to play with a kid! Great buy for me. Also I can imagine playing this with some gamer who likes simple logical games. Nice one.

It's fast, quite original, and decently fun for the first couple of plays. After that, do yourself a favour and switch to one of the GIPF-project games by the same Kris Burm!

The plastic part is a little on the flimsy side (save the insert and store the pieces in it), but the game is great fun and easily understood by even younger children.

This game could not be any simpler or fun.  It's a game my wife and I can play for the sake of playing a game without having to worry about who wins or loses.

A cute, simple game.  Good for taking up some time with the kids on a family weekend.  Even my 5 year old gets the hang of it! 

Not, however, a game to enthrall the hard core gamer for hours upon hours.  Nor was it meant to be.

Alright as a game, better as an art piece.  Kids seem to love it, however, and I suspect the kid's version, while uglier, is actually the more challenging game.

Drop flat, wooden geometric shapes between two sheets of transparent acrylic held in a Connect 4 style frame. You lose if your piece extends above the top of the frame. (A picture really says a thousand words here.) Good fun and very, very fast. Not much strategy [i]or[/i] dexterity to it, but a great filler.

This game isn't too exciting, especially because it's dexterity based. But I can be a sucker for pretty-looking abstract games and this one does look beautiful set up.

Light and kind of fun. Drop tangram-like pieces into a frame until one player is forced to (or mistakenly) leave a piece sticking out the top. They lose.

I have to try out the match rules sometime.

An abstract-dexterity hybrid. Intriguing.

Gigamic do it again, a beautiful game that lacks substance.  The truth is, marking this as an adult game would leave the score wanting (it is a pleasant diversion at best).  But as a childs game, it is probably rather good.  It promotes forethought, probably spatial awareness, and won't intimidate them.  I can't help feeling that, in the UK at least, it is very expensive for a couple of pieces of perspex and wood.

Not sure how replayable it would be, but it was decent enough for something ultra quick.

Quick two-player game with a slight bit of strategy in terms of when to play which piece. All of your planning can be destroyed though, depending on the "bounciness" of the table you play on since the pieces will move in ways you never expected. Great for kids.

[b]DEXTERITY FILLER FUN.[/b]

This game went down a storm at a family gathering. My folks liked it so much that they bought their own copy! Even my nan liked it. That should be all the recommendation you need.
My strategy has been to play all my smaller pieces first. This goes against everyone else's idea of a good play! But, mysteriously enough, it works. Go figure.

Batik is an abstract filler, pure and simple, with gameplay understandable even by the lowest of monkeys. I cannot play for long without becoming bored. However, I have seen others play this game for hours in a winner-stays-on tourney - it takes all sorts.

After 1 Play: Almost too simple to work, but it does.  I imagine the replayability is going to be pretty low.

A very simple game, but quite nice nevertheless. Especially great with children.

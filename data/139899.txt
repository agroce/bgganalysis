I was initially somewhat happy with this game until the 'creator' started calling people names. I guess I am just a dick!

Expansions with NO rules, scorecards with no downloads to print more, and "living rules"

As I call them, LAZY rules. Nobody playtested them and because we live in the digital age, we pay more to print the rules ourselves.

I can at least be thankful that the rulebook for Vivajava was a larger full print guide instead of a small add-on.

RATING: N/A
Interesting game with temporary teams and a fair amount of negotiation, with tactics and strategy involved.  I think there's a few too many moving parts for the strategy to work out.  Research rewards research, but research doesn't win the game, and it's tough to find other people who want to research and get the beans you want in that team.

Would probably play again, but do not need to own.

One of Dice Hate Me games best titles, alongside Brew Crafters and The Great Heartland Hauling Co. Nice design where you're competing Blends with rolls and can acquire various Abilities as you move along your scoring tracks. The solo variant is also pretty funny as you play against some 'evil' coffee-spewing corporation. Also love how the coaster designs make the game thematic, as well as the coffee colored first player token and the token bag.

I'm a huge coffee lover, and even roast my own green beans sourced from fair trade, organic estates. I thought this game would be the next step in my obsession, but it let me down, I'm afraid. My wife played once and refused to play with me again due to boredom. I hung on to it a while longer for the solo game, but that didn't work out either. Coffee is supposed to perk you up, not put you to sleep! Granted, there's some interesting design elements in there, but the gameplay is lacklustre at best. I really did give this one a shot, but ended up trading it away without regret. Every collection needs at least one roll-and-write game, and for some, this may well be it. For me, it's La Granja: No Siesta.

Players roll dice and develop important coffee blends to attract customers (points) and invest in research to become better baristas.  Effectively leveraging your research abilities and dice rolls is key to winning this fast paced, push your luck dice roller.

Decent dice-rolling Yahtzee descendant, with an admirable dedication to replay value. Unfortunately, suffers from a structural problem where the best way to move closer to victory is often to sit on your hands and literally do nothing. Interesting in theory, but in practice, not a hell of a lot of fun. I'd be fine playing it with someone who loves it, but it's not a game I'd bring to the table myself.

I had convinced a mate to kickstart this game and thought to myself "Well, no point in me getting a copy too is there?"  
http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dicehateme/vivajava-the-coffee-game-the-dice-game

As soon as the kickstarter ended, I knew I made the wrong choice.  I played the PnP version and gave it an easy 7 or 8.  Luckily, my mate was able to get a 2nd copy for me through his pledge!  (I also convinced him to get the non-dice version of VivaJava) 

I also have the Game of the Year expansion:

All cards sleeved. Added the score tracker sheets that someone made here on BGG, printed on a thicker paper stock they look just like an original game component. Added colored cubes from my game design pieces in each of the four colors as well. Much better than using pen/pencil to keep track of PP/RP. Also bought a coffee mug and padded the inside with felt so it could be used for rolling the bean dice. It works really well thematically.

VivaJava is a fun, light dice game that can be played in 20-40 minutes depending on number of players. The dice are of good quality as are the coasters used for the various blends and ability trackers. The theme works well with the game, check it out if you can manage to grab a copy.

A great surprise! This is a fun dice game with tons of variability, something rare for a tiny filler like this. The research tracks and continual scoring mechanics also give this a much more strategic feel than other dice games, enabling you to go for easy points or shoot for long-term benefits. The choice to roll or hold your brew adds another push-your-luck element to the game that I like. I must say I hate the pen-and-paper scoring sheets, and wish they had a more traditional scoring track with physical markers (the paper tracks are good for travel, I suppose). Regardless, I love the exchangeable research tokens and look forward to trying them all out.

TRADED IT!

It is a perfectly workable "Yahtzee-esque" game with some decent tension, interesting choices, and fantastic flavor. The variety from the ability discs ought to add replayability, but in the end, the game felt largely the same and they only added setup time.

Worth picking up if you absolutely love the coffee theme and don't mind running out of the cool tear off sheets (50 will go quick if playing with several players each session), otherwise I would stick with Alien Frontiers or Roll through the Ages.

RATING: 6
Yahtzee with super powers. Players are faced with a light, but none-the-less satisfying choice throughout the game; snatch up a blend to rack up points or invest in the research tracks to make blend-snatching easier down the road. The hoard of possible research abilities provides more than enough variability for a dice game of this weight and will help it secure a long shelf life.

Bought this for the other half who is a coffee lover. We spent aaaages trying to learn the game from the rulebook and had to resort to video help. Embarrassing for a filler! I'm all for writing thematic rulebooks but geez! Everything seemed to be cloaked in theme and we couldn't figure out what to do. You are not trying to rise to the dizzying heights of coffee stardom. You are rolling dice, and collecting them in a Yahtzee style way, to use special powers, to rack up points and beat your opponents. That's it. It took a long time to get to the meat of the game but we really love to play. LOVE the coffee bean dice. That's the best part for me. There are some decent decisions to be made within the game so it is more than just a mind numbing dice chucking filler. I'd call it Filler+

VivaJava feels like a gamer’s alternative to Yahtzee.  There are a lot of ways to use dice and score points and a lot of possibilities in terms of strategy.

Unlike Yahtzee, you have to earn your re-rolls through Research, along with other ways to manipulate and other actions; I have to stress that VivaJava is spiritually similar to Yahtzee and in few other ways mechanically similar other than rolling dice and trying to get various outcomes.

The game comes with variations and special powers including a randomiser that can mix up the game for plenty of variability and replayability.

I do however have to make a gripe about the manual; it omits a lot of details it seems, so much so that a FAQ had to be released and there are a lot of questions on BGG's forums for a game with such simple mechanics.  The effort was clearly put in but it comes across as quite fragmented with a few gaps so be prepared for a few teething problems in the first play-through.

The rules are difficult to grasp, which is silly since the game is not really that complicated. Murky rules can be gotten over, though, if the game they describe is solid once you figure it out. Sadly, what this game does is commit the ultimate dice game sin - severely limit your rolling of dice! You roll a handful of dice 1 time each turn (you might even forego this if it's strategically sound to not roll dice!), and to me a dice game is about rolling as much dice as possible all the time. If I'm going to play a dice game, I'll probably choose any number of games over this, and the list of awesome dice games is very long.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Even though VivaJava Dice is a very simple game, the rulebook makes it pretty hard to find out. Once you've waded through it, what remains is another Yahtzee-like dice roller with a few development opportunities. While it works, the decisions are usually fairly obvious, and the available powers and special abilities make King of Tokyo a far more entertaining game in the same neighbourhood.

You can add a bit of longevity into the solo game by mixing up the research discs beyond what is suggested officially in the rules but even doing that, it starts to feel a bit samey after a while.

My biggest problem with the game: Why does it come with a pad of sheets for keeping track of your score/research instead of tokens on a track? I don't mind games in which you score on a pad at the end but not when you have to constantly update and monitor your score/research levels throughout.

I've bought some coloured cubes to keep track of my research levels and I just keep score on a separate piece of paper.

Unusual for being a dice game where rerolls aren't automatic. Not sure I've seen a game where you didn't have to jump on the chance to acquire them, though.

But then you get to play with timing and pacing in a way I haven't seen other dice games do either. Something feels hinky-- I don't know if it's the "positive interaction" that's mostly meaningless in 2p, or the awkward rulebook, or just the fact that I don't actually like coffee. Still, I'll put up with a lot of small minuses for something that feels new.

Initially trickier to get to grips with, mainly because I've found the rulebook to be not as helpful as it could have been in places. Despite the initial reaction I was enjoying the learning curve, which isn't really too difficult to get to grips with.

As many will associate it with Yahtzee, they really wouldn't be wrong with the comparison. As you play more your abilities should increase and make your chances of success increase.

I feel that the game is fine for the most part, it's mainly the rules and explanations of them that I'm not really happy with, otherwise it's a decent one.

Even after watching online instructional videos, I wasn't too sure about game flow. VivaJava: The Dice Game has some cool game design ideas that should be much more intuitive.

The game mechanics are what have drawn me towards this game, but the theme really doesn't interest me. The game isn't thematic at all anyways, so why slap on such a boring theme? The rules were simple for gamers to understand, too simple, but at the same time too complicated for non-gamers. So it fell in an awkward place in between both.

This game would probably get a 9, because it has such a coherent color scheme that relates directly to the theme. However, simplicity/readability isn't taken into account. Some of the cards are a bit hard to read, and the player colors involve too many shades of neutralish: brown, black, white, tan. It's often difficult to differentiate. And the bags are white, which is boring. 

This is a FUN game. If you get a group of people together to play this, they will have fun, and they will feel a sense of accomplishment. The beauty of this game is that it combines the cooperative with the competitive. Players may work together on individual rounds, but have to balance possible benefits to their adversaries. The game moves through different phases and goals, and it is very psychologically pleasing because you have so many tiny goals set up, and always feel like you're getting somewhere. And you get to pull tiny beans out of tiny bags!

This is an interesting, if not perfect, take on Yahtzee-style mechanics. The game's biggest selling point - researching new abilities - isn't quite the game changer I hoped it would be. It doesn't really make the affair extremely strategic as luck of the dice rolls is at least partially going to determine the winner, but it does give the game quite a bit of replayability as there are some combinations of abilities that might give one better odds of winning. The game is perhaps just slightly too long and involved for what it is, but it I admire the ideas it brings to the table just enough that I plan on keeping it for a while until I explore different game setups.

You roll dice with different types of coffee beans. These can be used to build up your experience with a type of bean. This research gives you special abilities such as allowing rerolls and being able to improve a die. There are also tiles that can be gained to give victory points until someone takes them from you. This is a light game, but fun enough as a filler.

[u]Comment:[/u]
So if you read my comments regularly you probably know I can be a sucker for dice games, and this one is no exception. I think T.C Petty has put a nice spin on the Yahtzee style dice game and come up with something that easy and fun to play. The mechanics won't be strange to anyone who plays dice games, roll dice select what to do with said dice that were rolled. The interesting thing the designer has done here has put the dice you do not use on your turn to work and have you select which research you want them to be used for which are used to grant special abilities and powers during subsequent turns. All in all its a pretty enjoyable game, want to get in a few more games to see if my rating will change. In my first game there was a runaway leader problem due to a player having a great first roll that no one could beat until it had degraded down to 2 dice. Getting such a good roll early on with your opponents having no research is difficult to overcome. We will see how often this happens in future plays, and that could be what makes me change my rating.

Wir erwürfeln uns Kaffeespezialitäten ála Kniffel zusammen und erhalten Punkte wenn wir sie 1 Runde lang vor uns ausliegen lassen haben ála "King of Tokyo", muss dann aber einen Würfel herunternehmen, was es künftig einfacher macht es mir weg zu nehmen...
Dabei ist es reine Glückssache ob mich meine Gegner übertreffen, weil Grundsätzlich ist nur ein Wurf erlaubt. Erst mit Fähigkeiten, die ich durchs Würfeln freischalte darf ich öfter würfeln, einen Würfelwert erhöhen, Spezialwürfel erhalte und und und.
Am Anfang dachte ich: wasn scheiss Spiel, aber ich spiels trotzdem... Dann hab ich die Mechanik verstanden und es hat Sinn ergeben und auch etwas Spaß gemacht. Am Ende war es dennoch ein fast pures Glücksspiel und da spiele ich dann doch lieber: Nimm einen W100 und wer die höhere Zahl erwürfelt gewinnt... das geht dann wenigstens schneller vorbei...!

VERY difficult to decipher rules. Both my girlfriend and I plodded through the rulebook and came up more confused than our first read-through. It's like trying to build a stretch of road.  You need to get from point A to B.  This game's rules try to do that, until they added 40 on-ramps and 30 exits so the road is so muddled in over-complication that you don't know which end is up.

Well another Dice Hate me Games Kickstater that I am unhappy with.  The rules are non existent (I mean the game didn't come with rules for the expansions and I am to print them out myself and for a few days there were none).  There are several misprints on the cards / boards and really there isn't much game there.  The game can go fast or drag out for MUCH longer than it is worth investing time into.

Overall I am putting this in the same category as Carnival Dice  In my Kickstarter Regret pile and moving on.  I just hope that Brew Crafters is better and I have not had a chance to play Viva Java even though I got the KS edition.  I am now scared to give it a try.

Solo play is ok, but pretty random, as is the 2-player when using the Lite coaster; As with King of Tokyo, an early lead by your opponent can be impossible to overcome. In 2-player, using the House coaster gives a much more interesting and balanced game.

Multiplayer is lots better and I love the way you upgrade to get different abilities. Production is good and it's pretty simple to teach. That said, the rule book is swiss cheese when it comes to how various abilities interact.

Including the Game of the Year Expansion

Highly re-playable, customizable, light dice roller with solo rules built in.  Players roll dice to either make a blend (5 unique die faces or sets of 2 or more of the same face) or research "power ups" like the ability to re-roll dice.  Games last fairly quickly (in a good way), so players must make the most of any accumulated research to focus on generating scoring opportunities as early as possible.

Először a pozitívum. A játék kinézete, a játék elemei mind-mind nagyon szépek és minőségiek. Egyedi és hangulatos a téma, amihez jól passzolnak az elemek (kávébabok a kockákon, barna színvilág a korongokon).

Viszont, ami nem tetszett: oké, hogy egy kockajátéknál a szerencsefaktor magas (még akkor is, ha ezt megpróbálják tompítani), de 2 játékból kétszer fordult elő, hogy ha az egyikünk az utolsó dobásoknál egyszer csak egy kockával erősebbet dob, akkor a végeredmény is teljesen másként alakult volna.

Emellett hiába van minden játék során 5 különféle speciális akció, mégsem éreztem, hogy megfelelő számú opcióm lenne ahhoz, hogy jól taktikázhassak. Ennek ellenére mindkétszer én nyertem (2 fős játékban), de valahogy elmaradt a katarzis érzés.

Persze, ez egy ilyen játék, kár is lenne heavy eurós kvalitásokat várni tőle, de party játéknak meg lehet, hogy már nem ezt választanám.

Az egyszer használatos (toll-ceruza igényes) jegyzetlapok miatt meg újabb 0.5 pontot levontam a végső pontszámból. Oké, hogy a kávéhoz jobban passzol egy firkálgatós papírfecni, mint egy komolyabb pontozótábla, de itt a praktikusság valószínűleg legyőzte volna a hangulatot is, ha normálisan megoldják a pontozást.

Ez a kávé most elsőre koffeinmentesre sikerült, de a komponensek és a téma miatt biztosan kap majd még esélyt.

Now that I actually have the rules down, this game isn't bad. It's not great either, but at least it's one I'll play now. I still think runaway leaders are a big problem, and the game is way too random to be taken seriously. That being said, the different technologies are interesting, and while not all are useful, it makes every game feel different. This game is ultimately okay for me. There are better dice games, but this has enough unique things going on to stand out from the crowd.

RATING: 7
One of the more complex in the Yahtzee genre, of which I've played more than a few lately (Bang the Dice Game, King of Tokyo, Pickomino), and maybe the best of the lot (well, other than Pickomino). Not my favorite genre though, as there's nothing much to do during the downtime that is such an unavoidable aspect of the genre. The interesting part about this one is the engine building -- you don't start with the ability to reroll, and must acquire it somehow.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great dice game - but a bit more complex than most. If you like dice games but find King of Tokyo or similar games a bit too simplistic and/or random, (e.g. a more serious 'gamer' group rather than casual family group), this might be a perfect quick dice game for your group. Lots of variety due to the different setup combinations for special abilities. However the complexity makes it a bit less accessible than simpler games like King of Tokyo.

I guess it's just not my "cup of tea". ;-)

The general concept sounded actually quiet appealing to me, sort of a Yahtzee-based engine-building, but in our plays the game fell always kind of flat. 
Due to the very limited options in the beginning there is not much chioces to be made or they seem rather obvious and once the game actually does start to give you more options and choices the game is just over too quickly to really get some interesting combos going.

Keeping up with the different powers also felt a little bit fiddly, I guess I would have preferred some sort of little player board (similar to Evolution or Progress) so you don't need a pen.

[b]VivaJava: The Dice Game[/b] was received in a trade (12/29/14) then sold via auction 10/15/16.. 

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]Viva Java Dice has become one of my favorite light, dice filler games. It works really well at all player counts and it's a game that everyone in my house likes. Combine that with the quick play time and it has hit the table a lot in my house. I love the variable set up in the beginning, we still haven't come close to using all the different research powers (although we do have some favorites, we tend to like the dice manipulation ones). I just got the expansion and I'm looking forward to trying some of the new coasters/research powers.

I would highly recommend this game for a quick filler, especially if you like dice games.[/i]

SOLO規則還算不錯
有壓迫感
不過基本上還是不斷擲骰的遊戲
能力的變化說實話不算很大
所以體驗體驗就好
規則:
*選擇一面研究杯墊，另外放風味特調跟彩虹杯墊
*每個人拿一計分紙跟幫助卡還有3個token，全部擲一白骰，骰面擲最高的起始，其他玩家在自己擲骰的該色研究軌畫一格
*遊戲進行多回合，直到有人到21分獲勝，每回合分成三個步驟
1.如果你面前有分數杯墊就計分，根據人數或杯墊不同分數不同，風味特調此事會少一顆骰，由你決定，之後可決定放棄該特調骰上面的骰子(剩一顆一定要選)或是維持該特調則直接換人行動
2.拿五顆骰擲(如果1階段有風味特調且放棄，則拿上面的骰數擲)，有黑骰一定要擲，骰完可決定
A.做特調(一定要5顆)，風味特調先跟別人面前的比同骰面的顆數(至少2)，平手在比骰值，如果超過就可以搶過來並把所有骰子方上去(沒人拿就直接拿)，黑骰全部換成白骰放，彩虹特調則是五顆都不同，杯墊拿過來後不用放上去，每有大小之分，拿到杯墊都先拿一分
*每個人面前最多一個特調杯墊，那另外一個就要還一個
B研究 根據骰面選擇一個顏色在對應研究軌有幾顆畫幾格，黑骰面讓你拿黑骰，到達1X就表示可使用研究杯墊該顏色能力一次，到達最後一格拿分數，但是不能再使用該能力
3.啟動能力 如果有能力研究完成，可在此時啟動，結束後就換人
*黑骰在別人丟骰時也可一起丟(顆數自選)，如果別人想要使用來做特調就放你的標記上去換成白骰放到杯墊上，馬上拿1分，如果輪到他計分，上面幾個你的標記幾分，所有黑骰使用完就還回去
*個人顏色標記通常回紀錄特殊能力，拿到時就拿該標記放到該軌尾吧，使用後就還回去
***變體研究***
*黃色重骰子控制能力抽一放，研究抽一放棕色，紅綠放特殊能力圓片
*實習生能力配合對應杯墊，獲得時放一個方塊在其中一格空格上，2X時則是該能力兩倍
**SOLO***
*同兩人規則，使用單人杯墊，根據難度放一token在綠/黃/紅指標區，AI分數需要另外紀錄
*每回合你結束幫AI動作，看誰先21分，AI不會做研究，當三顆一樣以上才會做風味特調，成功做特調則指標下降一格，如果做特調失敗，指標上升一格，拿彩虹特調只有在第一骰拿不到風味特調才會拿，AI沒有特調杯墊上限
*風味特調計分時幫他移掉最不需要的骰，只有在骰數剩兩顆時會放棄，並馬上拿五顆重骰
*OT 每次骰完根據指標數字可重骰對應次數，每次保留最高等級同色骰(除了第一骰就彩虹就拿彩虹杯墊以外，一直重骰到對應次數)，次數到還沒贏就指標上升一格
*SI 根據指標數字拿黑骰，丟骰時一起丟，如果沒辦法做特調則指標上升一格，然後丟一骰，根據結果你不能在該軌做研究或使用該能力

A good dice game that has some similarities with Roll Through the Ages and King of Tokyo, though I find VivaJava Dice to be better than those two games (I can't stand KoT). VivaJava Dice is more of an engine building euro with dice whereas KoT is more Ameritrash (more trash than Ameri) VivaJava gives players the choice on a given turn of investing in research/technology or creating a coffee blend.  The coffee blend is basically a king of the hill mechanic that produces points when blends survive.  The research tracks can be customized giving the game a decent amount of variety.  Even with this variety, however, I grew somewhat tired of the game.  I suppose there was often a lot of small steps that needed to be remembered especially when certain research tracks were in play.  Sometimes the game felt more fiddly than it should for such a simple dice game.  The rule book is not the best and certain abilities take some time to figure out and there are some combos that were not considered in playtesting and questions had to be answered online.  Overall it is a good filler but it ultimately got pushed aside for me.


UPDATE:  This game, unfortunately, seems to lose its luster fairly quickly.   Sold.

Not a bad game, but one that I disliked because it is a dice rolling game where a main way to win points is to not roll once you have placed a high enough roll for others to match. So, you could be on the lead for a while with only a couple roles, essentially passing on your turn to accumulate points. To me that defeats what makes dice games fun to play.

A nice shorter implementation of true VivaJava. If it supported more players this could really shine at my game table.

The rulebook and proofing makes me angry.  The rulebook and rule reminder card use different phase numbering.  The research card and rule cards use different names for some common research effects.  The rules are confusingly ordered and common events are obscurely buried amongst rambling.

However, once deciphered, the game is a functioning game.  It is pleasing and I think it would warrant a 6/10 if there weren't so much early game luck.  A lucky early roll can earn you so many points that nobody has a hope of catching up.  Also, most turns, the best move is obvious.

There are also unnecessarily fiddly components that make it hard to figure out what a special power does.  You have to look at two or three levels of indirection to figure out what each power means, and it could have been one-to-two with slightly better information representation.  That plus the rules just leave me irritated at the game, and unwilling to give it a pass on weaknesses in the game itself, however light it is intended to be.  A light random game can't be confusing and messy, but a complex game shouldn't be so random.

An opportunity was missed here for a very interesting game, but missed it was.

And the expansion.

Impression: after 2 plays, I like it quite a bit. Awesome filler with a lot ot modularity, plays great with 2 and solo play included. The dice are sexy and feel great, the tech tree is awesome, and the gameplay is fast. There's also quite a bit of interaction through special abilities. You can block actions for other players, or piggyback points through opponent's blends by usage of your flavor dice (which you also have to work for), lovely stuff. I just wished they would've released player boards to keep track of the research progression. I don't like the pencil and paper thing at all, but that's personal preference. I suspect with the expansion, I'll be busy for a while. Happy to own it. I am going to drink a mocha frap as I play it next time.


Components: Great dice, good cardboard, and first player token with erasing capabilities lol. Not a fan of the paper and pencil thing as mentioned above.

8 plays later: This game is amazing! My g/f is in love with so that's even better. Now we want to play it all the time. Boom boom boom, all done in filler time. 2p is good and 3p is even better.

該遊戲的版圖版堪稱是咖啡版《CO2》+《奧古斯都》，而骰子版卻變成了一個4人遊戲。遊戲中玩家扮演一個咖啡公司的研究人員，要嘗試製作最受歡迎的咖啡。每回合玩家可以做咖啡或研究，研究的話可以研發特殊能力；做咖啡可以得分，同時如果一輪後，玩家所做的咖啡依然是全場最受歡迎的咖啡，則可以獲得額外得分，但是做咖啡本身難度很高，如果沒有研究能力，則很難超過其他玩家的優質咖啡組合，算是一個有點策略的小遊戲吧

Played once with 4P. A fairly ordinary dice game with a name that is simultaneously tongue-in-cheek and grating to spell out. Players roll dice each turn and either play king-of-the-hill, or unlock abilities which – among other things – allow them to play Yahtzee with their future rolls. 

There is nothing to the gameplay to commend or complain about. The modular abilities are a nice addition to increase replay value, but the game lacks an engaging twist to keep players hooked. The graphics deserve praise though, as they capture the otherwise non-existent coffee theme. The only hiccup is that arranging the abilities on a wheel made them cumbersome to refer to.

Gamer's yahtzee. Players roll dice and use the results to research new abilities or vie for control of various "blends" that score points every turn.  There's probably some deeper strategy here, but this game excels as a lighter game to open or close out a game night.

This is another Yahtzee-style dice rolling game.  This one has a lot of similarities to King of Tokyo for me.  Players roll dice with different colored beans on them in order to brew coffee.  You can brew either the feature blend for sets of 2 or more of the same color bean or a rainbow blend of 5 different color beans.  When you do you take "control" of that blend and you score points for each round you maintain control of it as well as immediately upon taking control.  The game is a race to 21 points.

If you don't blend coffee you can research instead to earn the ability to re-roll, upgrade bean quality, block your opponents abilities, etc.  In the end though this is just another Yahtzee-style game and it doesn't really do enough unique for me to really set my heart aflutter.

It does fit in a smaller box, play in 20 minutes or less even at 3 or 4 players, and works fine for 2 so it is great filler material if you like the theme and are looking for this type of game.

Really fun dice-game: plays quick (just one roll per person), has extremely high replayability and is over quick enough to play another round, or to function as a pre-amble to a gaming night's main fare.

Gist of the game is the decision whether to 'cash in' your roll (make a blend) or to strengthen your roll-mechanics (research). Cashing in nets you the points to win, but if other players are also gunning for the points you might be better to wait it out. Or choose to research the flavor dice which actually makes it easier for other players to go for the points (and let you profit from that). This makes for a very interactive dice rolling game, where you constantly are assessing the other players' situation as well and meanwhile expending your own repertoire of tricks to get into scoring position. Add in some end-of game tension where you get quick bonus points for filling up tracks (damaging your trick potential in the process) and you have a clear winner.

Highly recommend this excellent little game.

I'm usually not a fan of anything that has "the Dice Game" in it's name, but I've heard good things and wanted to give this one a try. The coffee theme is pretty thin, but there is a research track that's pretty cool. As expected from a dice game, it feels very lucky. Amazingly our game finished up very closely. You need 21 points to win and the other 3 people had 20, 20, and 19 points. It's a decent filler dice game, but nothing I need to own, despite the fact that I live in Seattle where there are coffee shops everywhere.

Not a terrible game but it has the same problem I have with most dice games: it is almost entirely dependent on the luck of the dice. I like the abilities you gain and they can help you to mitigate the dice to some degree. But if someone gets lucky and rolls a really good featured blend, and they keep it for three rounds, then they're already 9 points toward the 21 point victory condition. All for just getting a lucky dice roll.

Also, the amount of rules ambiguities is crazy for what should be such a light game. There's a pretty lengthy FAQ online and you will have to refer to it multiple times each game.

Good fun! I was on a huge dice kick after King of Tokyo.  I picked up Roll Through the Ages afterwards, but with bored with the lack of interaction and rolling options. This is the game I wanted Roll Through the Ages to be.

You have research tracks, different choices to make every game.  It's a dice game but you can tailor it to your play style.  Lots of ways to interact with opponents that aren't too mean.  TONS of variability with all of the different research options and boards you can swap out.  It even has a decent solo player variant that's pretty fun.

Slight complaints: With how fast it moves, and the multiple sets of dice, I wish it went up to 5 players.  I might grab some discs from another game and see if it's unbalanced at all at that number.  The rulebook is cute, but not practical.  Fortunately the game is easy to teach, but it was harder than it needed to be to learn from the book.

I will preface this by saying I have a very low tolerance for light dice games. This one is at the edge of my threshold. It doesn't have enough meaningful decisions to suit my taste. The misprint on the LITE coaster also added to its poor first impression, because I played through my first game with no clue what "Extra Flavor" did. The only reasons I'm still keeping it (so far) are that it's portable and I think the theme will appeal to people in my gaming groups. I consider it slightly better than King of Tokyo (which I would rate a 4 if I bothered rating things I don't own) because it doesn't have player elimination.
Update August 2015: After several more plays, my impression didn't improve, so I found this game a new home.

Filler dice rolling coffee game or Java Dice.  Strategy decisions follow luck of the roll to allocate your coffee bean dice as set collection to make rainbow or special blend coffees for points, or build coffee tech tree for special abilities. Thematically, I like how the game is played on modular printed drink coasters with a large selection of different special abilities for game variety. I'm always a sucker for getting the cool looking flavor dice.

This is going to sound insane - because it is - but the theme alone is enough to drown my interest.

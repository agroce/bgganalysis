Awesome game. Reminds me a lot of the Soulsborne series. Excellent art and fun basic gameplay. Interesting story and characters in it, and the overall dark mood is just great. It's a breath of fresh air within gaming and it truly is an adventure in a dark world in it. Highly recommended!

RATING: 7.5
+ very immersive atmosphere
+ deep story telling
+ adventure feeling
+ simple but exciting combat system
+ stunning artwork
+ Arawn and the Dragon are brutal villians :)

- rulebook is kinda weak
- needs more world cards
- event card skill checks are very random (you cannot negate anything without some items like a lucky coin)

For people who like Defenders of the realm and Arkham Horror/Eldritch Horror, this game could be for you. I am very excited about the future of this game.

An interesting game with lots of moments where you reveal hidden information, which makes it exciting if you like surprises. There's stories, quests, power-ups, a bit of puzzlely aspect, and dice rolling, makes for a tense and fulfilling game. If you like Legends Of Andor, I recommend giving Of Dreams & Shadows a try. There are 3 main villains with a pile of stories/quests for each, so there's plenty of game in the box. Artwork is fantastic as well. It would play well as a solitaire game controlling multiple champions, there's not much to manage per champion. Looking forward to the expansion.

While featuring standard fantasy themes, we saw the artwork hands-on at Spiel and the artwork on the cards and characters is really cool and thematic, with interesting characters and atmospheric perspectives. The images in the gallery don't do justice to it. It really blew me away, how much of a positive effect this can have on the perception of a game. (Mage Knight *cough* *cough*)

RATING: 6.5
The art is excellent, the setting is promising, and the backbone of the game generally holds together. There are a few things that seem less than ideal, however, and I don't think this game has really cracked the nut when it comes to improving the typical flaws found in similar designs.

One pervasive issue is the greatly restricted ability to move around the map; with only 3 actions, one of which almost certainly needs to be used to eliminate a shadow token, characters are generally forced to stay in the same area of the map for much of the game. This is common in cooperative games with maps, and tends to pigeonhole players and eliminate meaningful choices ("Well who else could possibly get to that shadow token?"). My suggestion here would be to introduce ways to allow shadow tokens to be eliminated without requiring an action.

Another shortcoming is that there seems to be little one can do to either predict the attribute(s) needed for succeeding at scenarios (outside of Might for combat), or really much choice in improving attributes, since the only way to do that is by buying from a random card offer. In addition, since gold can only be acquired by killing monsters, and then only by the character that deals the killing blow, it's quite likely that characters will go without gold for much or all of the game, limiting access to the primary means of growing in power. Instead, scenarios could directly provide bonuses to attributes (with choice), give items that provide bonuses, or simply provide gold.

The underlying issue seems to be that games of this type are fairly straightforward to make function because they are quite resilient to mediocre or incomplete design choices. The result is that unless the designer is particularly skilled or opinionated about how to innovate and address systemic problems in this type of game, the resulting design will be workable but fall short of its potential. I hope that Gordon and team continue developing the design and think more about mechanisms that would provide more meaningful choices to players to match the well-executed narrative engine.

My comment is for quality of game components and a brief first turn solo play (which appears to work fine). The quality of the game is fantastic. The art is wonderful and illustrations are abundant throughout the game. The game board is beautiful and of outstanding quality. The thick components punched out cleanly and the art on them is terrific, in harmony with art on the cards. Everything is close to perfect as possible, though I'm not a fan of the bold type in the manual, which would have benefitted with more play examples. I am looking forward to writing a review after I have more time to play. If excellent art and quality of components are important to you, this game is a winner. Of course the game design is more critical, though my first attempt to learn and play the game reveals a very interesting theme with depth and replay potential.

RATING: 8
Rating based on a single play-through. Plays very similar to Eldritch Horror on a more compact game board - every player has an action/move phase, then has a combat phase, then has each player enacts a scenario (draws and has another player read aloud), then the group experiences an event (i.e. Mythos phase from Eldritch), and then you repeat.
However, unlike in Eldritch, where you are trying to prevent (and usually failing!) the Big Bad from arriving, in Of Dreams & Shadows the Big Bad will always show their face and you will always confront them. Of Dreams & Shadows plays as I described above for five turns over a first act, and then switches to a compressed Act 2 for five turns where you no longer complete scenarios or events.

I think I'll always prefer the theme in Eldritch to this game, but the art style and quality in Of Dreams & Shadows is absolutely great. The component quality is top-notch. The cards are all appropriately sized, with many of the cards being much bigger than you normally see - both a good thing (more fun story text for scenarios, easier reading) and a bad thing (much more table-space required).

Sometimes it can get a little fiddly trying to find the standees for monsters that spawn. Especially since there are 25+ different monsters and each are "owned" by one of the three main baddies - but you'll often spawn monsters belonging to one of the two bosses you are not playing against, so you'll always need to keep all components on-hand.

The rules are very thorough, but in a few circumstances I had to keep referring back just to make certain we were playing correctly (this was the first play for all five of us). One example of confusion: If a boss has seven monsters associated with them, they'll have seven cards, one for each monster. However, there are duplicate standees for every monster - meaning multiples of each monster can spawn. But damage is permanent and fights may end without a monster being defeated. So it becomes confusing on the intended method of tracking damage (answer: however you find convenient - to their credit I believe the game developer has already acknowledged this "issue" on BGG forums).

One particular spell seems *extremely* OP. Or rather, essential. Without it, spell-casters seem to be much weaker than their counterparts and fights in general are much more difficult. Considering a house-rule to making spells a "tap" card similar to the feats you can acquire in the game.

Definitely plan on playing again... but as a huge fan of Eldritch Horror there isn't enough that's different to keep me coming back to Of Dreams & Shadows if my friends suggest Eldritch.

I played a demo of this game at SPIEL 2016. I absolutely loved the artwork and the general setting of exploring a fantasy world together.

Hope it will be available for the European market soon!

The first true Rôle play cardboard game, even if some big game like gloomhaven and kingdom death have done à great work on the scenario, but oDaS is 100% scenario ^^. There is scenarized quest and event everywhere all the time. You get it on manifold, diversified, big, well written cards. Well, once the most important point was discussed, I put 10 stars to this cardboard game because of the exeptional quality of his written material, but the rule should more have 6 or 7 stars, so one advice: play to this game once then think about some home rules to keep the fun in the game for the two other scenarios.

That is a world of myths in a box. The art on the cards and the standees is amazing and highly immersive. The basic rules are fairly easy but in conjunction with the story and mechanics offered on those cards the game really shines. It is amazing how many wonderful things are evolving on the comparable little board! That is a keeper for sure!

This is an odd one for me.  We were absolutely stomped by this game, mangled and eaten for lunch.  Not even close to competing, and I'm not sure how being competitive will be possible.  Maybe more than two players helps?  The art is very nice.  The text is often trite and the characters are standard fantasy steroetypes.  But I really enjoyed the game and what it was trying to do.  There will be some replay value in it, and I think I can get into the story enough to overlook the plot flaws and standard fantasy accompanyments and just enjoy the ride.  Interetsed in my next play, for sure.

...Talisman SOLO + Massive graphics and story line...Two things to change...
- If you play with 3 characters [shadow tokens] every 2nd turn should be 1 not two
- Wound and Boon tokens could be I & II on the same token just like head I and tail II
overall game is fantastic :)

Upcoming (2016-09) pure co-op. Encounters are story-based, similar to but with more flavor than EH. Combat is more detailed, with attack/defend each round, and keep going until you win, lose, or retreat. $52 CAD on preorder. Self-published.

As far as storytelling goes, this game is almost perfect, the quests and world card events are very well written and even offer choice sometimes instead of just skill check (another player will read the card for the active player). The artwork is also very good. The combat mechanics and character development need some improvement but those dont devalue the game as they are now. It would be nice to enhance skills by choice with some +1 to skill tokens and not just with items that are available randomly. Replay value is somewhat limited it seems (just 3 villains), but since there are expansions planned, its a non issue.

Dice luck can be mitigated.

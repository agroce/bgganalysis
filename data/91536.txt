I would probably play this a whole lot more if I had never acquired the App version... Sadly, this one rarely makes it to the table anymore because of the ease of the app. Otherwise a pretty fun game, perhaps supplanted as well by the infinite draw of the Marvel (and other) Dice Building games.

RATING: 5.5
Interesting use of dice, but not all that fun gameplay. I get excited as my turn approaches, but the actual turns are dissapointing, as you don't usually roll as awesome as you are hoping for. The game is also very unforgiving, keeping players down who get off to a bad start, while letting players who score points ditch crappy dice so their dice pool gets even better. The dragon that is immune to level 1 and 2 monsters is rediculous and makes almost all other monsters useless, and portals just aren't very fun (a portal! let's see what's inside! *rolls* manna! Oh, I meant Quiddity!).

Also, WAY too many stupid Q words that really just shouldn't be there.

RATING: N/A
This has quickly become a favorite in our household.  Basically, it's Dominion with dice, so there's one more level of randomness on top of the draw.  I love dice, and slowly building a collection of a spectrum of dice over a game is great.

Fun dice building game with a ton of luck.  If you love dice, you'll love this.  Note, the game is improved by the advanced rules.  The base game has some pretty serious problems... basically, whoever buys a dragon first wins.  Too short and lucky to be strategic, which is irritating.  Needs the expansions with more variety.

My one play generated enough excitement for me to buy it - followed months later by zero occasions to play it followed by zero desire to play it. What happened? I just don't want to get it out and roll dice. It doesn't interest me after that first play. I'm pretty much burned on deck building games. Ah well. Maybe another time. Or I might just dump this on to the trade pile.

RATING: 5.5
The randomness of rolling the dice, added to the randomness of which dice are drawn from your bag, make this game simply too... random.  I don't find the dice included in the game particularly well-crafted. They're small and some symbols (particularly the numbers) are difficult to read, especially from across the table.  And there just isn't enough to this game to make it interesting.

+Unique twist on deck building games.

-Excessive randomness (random dice draw + dice rolling) makes for uneven play.
-Dice are small and difficult to read.
-Even thinner theme than Dominion.

Very fun game. It seems like it will need expansions as the creatures and spells get overplayed. I love the feeling the dice add to a deck building type game.

As an added bonus, it is very easy to teach and learn. I've taught a few people by setting the same up and then taking a turn. I think the only thing I had to explain later was the culling with scoring, but that's it. There is not much to it.

Update: hmmm. after the initial plays this hasn't come out too often, and other games seem to have taken it's place. rating lowered substantially (6.5) to reflect current feelings toward the game. 

Rated a 9 because it's fast and fun to play with my 8 year old son. 20 minutes is really all this takes and you get a a deck building lite experience in that time which has been a big hit here. Not for a serious gaming group perhaps.

RATING: 5
It was hard for me to jump into this, having to bend over the table to read what the dice were and how they worked. I guess if you play this enough to memorize without having to really rely on the cards that tell you what the dice mean I could see it being better. My husband and son have been playing this and had a good grasp on it before I played with them which definitely left me at a big disadvantage. Other games like Dominion and Ascension they also played first and I was able to jump in and their experience and explaining the game was helpful to me, but with this game their help didn't translate and I could not get a good grasp of how everything played together to build a good strategy for myself. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Almost like Dominion, but with dice. The only problem is the balance issues. Dominion is fairly balanced because there's less luck involved and your card powers are fixed. There's a lot more luck in Quarriors (since your monster could just give you Quiddity instead of being an actual monster) and a lot of the monsters are unbalanced (i.e. they are practically guaranteed to win just due to their defense). Still, those that like randomness would like this. At least it has a bit more theme than Dominion...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The base game system itself is terrible, and the "expert" rules fix some of its inherent flaws by jettisoning the idea of building a dice bag over time--which is the most fun part of this kind of game!  Strangely enough, though, I still kind of like Quarriors.  Even if the rules are bad, buying and rolling tons of cool-looking custom dice is just fun.  This is a good game to play with people who don't want something too think-y because they don't have to think and can have a reasonable chance of winning anyway.

RATING: 8
[2-4] Need to try with the advanced variant:
1) Base 2 die buys per turn instead of 1
2) Can't buy 2 of the same die on a turn 
3) No exhausted creature game end
-) You can only cull the creature you score and you have the option of keeping the creature, not scoring it, and culling another used die

RATING: 7
Hmm...It's like [b]Dominion[/b] in a couple of ways, but it adds a whole new dimension.  That dimension is an extra layer of randomness from the dice.  You may think you're buying a cool power, but it may only show up a fraction of the time.

The playing time is enjoyably short, but I think the randomness works against that: a couple of turns of bad rolls seems to really hinder you.

I think there's real potential here, but I have to play it more to adjust to the limitations of the game.

Update:  Just played with 2.0 rules.  It changes the dynamic of the game so it feels (and flows) different, but it just doesn't fix the game.  I still really want to like this.

RATING: 6
+ Tons of amazing-looking dice; Various different creatures with some cool abilities.
- There aren't any real combination or synergy between dice; Even more than other games, it is completely luck driven.


Why it's previously-owned:
It was super hot when it came out, but unlike Dominion, there really didn't seem to be too many interesting and inter-locking combinations to explore.  Instead, it just felt like an exercise in who could roll better. 
I traded this away with Code 777 for TAMSK.

Dice rolling Dominion style. My impression after one game was that there was not too much to decide in your turn is you play with the original rules. I found in BGG that I was not the only one left with this impression and that some house rules or expansions may change that. It is a pity that you have to wait for the expansion to get a set of rules that plays well.

What the heck?  WHY is this such a big buzz?

Culling is probably the worst rich-get-richer effect I've ever seen in a game.  A shame, you could have something interesting here...


OK, updated:  the culling is sort of dumb, but there's so much luck it isn't as awful as it would be in a balanced system like Dominion.  This is a pretty random and sometimes rather dull (due to lack of choices) game, but so quick and light it is on this side of "ok" anyway.

RATING: N/A
It was dominion with dice, but not as good in my opinion. Though the theme slightly more to my tastes. A bit too fiddly, you replace shuffling with bag-draw which I dislike even more. Still it did have some goodness in that everyone had a cull option (sometimes).

Beautiful cards and fantastic dice. The theme of the game is great, components are top notch.

Game play wise is average as there are nothing more that dice collection, rolling them and doing your best to get the most out of what the dice allows you to do. So in a sense, the dice plays you, you don't play the game......

After the 50th dice rolled.....boredom sets in. Not as bad as dominion.....controls so many minions.....but limited in use. Nothing to battle, besides just 'besting' the single enemy.....no dungeon crawl, no heavy conflicts, no epic battles. Just roll the dice, collect 'price' if surpass.....

I like dice games, but I also like control. Quarriors suffers from too much luck: luck of the draw + luck of the roll. There are very few ways to mitigate bad rolls (or bad draws) in this game, so basically, if you roll well at the beginning of a game, you should win. Runaway leader problems and too much randomness really damper the fun factor. However, there are optional "advanced" rules (from Quarmageddon) that help solve this problem. Quarriors scores points for the beauty of its bits and the originality of its packaging (and branding in general). While not a masterpiece, it is a light and fun game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Very light, very fast take on the deckbuilding game, but I'm becoming convinced that the correct play is virtually always to buy the biggest monster available, since these are simultaneously the most damaging, the hardest to remove, and score enough points to win the game if they survive only a few times in a 4-player game, making it just a game about racing to be the first one to play a dragon.

RATING: 6
Deckbuilding games and dice games both tend to get a cool reception from me.  So what chance a dice-building game?  Against the odds, I quite enjoyed Quarriors.  

Re-rolling is sensibly kept in check to deliver quick turns and a quick game overall.  There are, of course, different powered monsters and spells to pick up and try to combine; although in this I found Quarriors much less sophisticated than Dominion.  There is also player interaction, with monsters fighting and spells going off.  In short, I found it kind of fun, if not deep.

Quarriors is nicely packaged and those dice are colourful.  Problems came from reading the itty figures on them and from the need to read card text across the table.

Quarriors! is a dice building game similar to how Dominion is a deck building game (and so far I think Quarriors! is the better game).

It is easy to learn, fast to play, has good components and artwork, and has substantial variability for replay value.  Though it is a dice-fest there is strategic depth to the game.

Overall I think it fits in well as a lighter game or as 30 min filler game.

Basically a dice-version of Dominion.  With lots of luck.  In fact, it's almost all luck, with almost no strategic decisions to make.  You roll the dice, and either summon the only creature you have, or buy the only creature you can afford that is worth buying.  And there will be a runaway leader.  Would be improved if there were multiple paths to victory, so players could still compete even if they get a step behind the mad rush to buy the one creature that is any good in the match. This game would be great with kids.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The only deck (dice) building game other than Dominion where I devour every expansion like croissants.  I love the feel of the dice, I love the variety from game to game.  Where I believe this game fails a little is in the complexity actually.  Once the dice are pooled in the wilds before the game actually starts, there is a lot of card ability reading and creature stat comparing that slows down what should be a fun casual dice rolling game.  Then again, if it were simplified maybe it wouldn't have the staying power and draw that it does.

Looking forward to this one, I hope it'll be good!

9/27 the hype has died down for me since this has came out, I think I'll be passing on this one for right now. I'm sure something better will be out in the future.

There are a lot of them in this box. And it is always so much fun to roll them. Collecting monsters and fighting it out. We just wish this game had a bit more theme in it. We cannot quite put our fingers on what would help that out but we wish we could.

Juego ligero y "sencillote". Entretenido para pasar el rato cuando no te apetece pensar demasiado. Las partidas no son muy largas pero, por desgracia, requieren de una preparación inicial y tienen un desarrollo que lo hacen poco apetecible como "filler".

Si te gustan esas tardes en las que se juega a varios juegos distintos Quarriors! es une buena elección. No se hace pesado y se acaba en cosa de una hora.

A dice building game which is unsurprisingly entirely dependent on luck. The only way to stop a player running away with the victory is to hope they roll badly. It's possible to create the perfect pool and still come last through bad rolling.

Verdict: neat.  A "dice-building" game a la Dominion with tiny card-specific dice rather than cards or chips.  The dice have special symbols on them with meaning denoted on the cards, so there can be wildly different versions of dice simply by changing out a single card.  I really like that system.  As for the game, and the effects of the cards I played, it made me yearn for Dominion's relative simplicity and elegance.  Not a fan of the non-standard box, or the lack of turn order adjustments.  I think this game is on the right path in evolving the genre, and look forward to further variants on the theme.  I could easily see looking back on this as a missing link for builders (unlike, say, Ascension or Puzzle Strike).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun game.  I worry that some of the creatures are overpowered - it seemed unlikely that anything could take out the Quake Dragon in my one game.  I need more plays, but definitely a good time.

SECOND PLAY: I think the three-player game is better than the four-player game.  It doesn't seem as short.  I look forward to trying it with two.

THIRD PLAY: Nope.  Not working for me.  Most DBGs rely on randomness with the card draw, but this adds a die roll to that randomness.  The dice are really cool, but the gameplay is just too clunky and not very fun to me.

From my point of view, this is a dice version of Thunderstone, and ranks about the same, but as a quicker lighter variant.

The main advantage of Quarriors over Thunderstone is the quicker setup and cleanup.  The main disadvantage is the shallower story a game session tells.

Luck is in fact really no different.  The illusion is that Thunderstone is lower luck, but it is not.  They are equivalent.

Really fun game, as long as you don't mind the luck factor being quite strong. I've only played the base game once at this point, because the game pieces were extremely bad right out of the box and they need to be replaced.

The quality of the dice (both the inking and the molding) and of the cards in my particular set is horrendous.  The condition of the contents looked more like a game bought at a thrift store, rather than brand new in shrink wrap (and for $60, I might add). 

I also bought the expansion:  Quarriors: Rise of the Demons, which was in perfect condition except for missing paint/ink on one die.  So it's not as though the quality can't be achieved, just that inferior product is being made and shipped.

After multiple emails to the publisher I have yet to receive a response, and their replacement system only allows five replacements of dice or cards (and this is only one of each type, whereas I need a total of 21 dice and an entirely new deck of cards--every card in the set was badly creased). 

So for game play based on one play, I'd give it a solid 9.  However, for quality of product and customer support, I drop that to a 1.

This is a shame, as I really wanted to like this game, but every single time I take it down from the shelf I end up putting it back, because it irks me all over again that Wiz Kids has such poor regard for their customers.  Just looking at the condition of the cards will ruin any enjoyment I might have from playing the game. 

If I ever hear back from Wiz Kids, maybe I'll adjust my rating.

2/28/13: Adjusted rating to a 2, as I finally received a response from customer support.

3/13/13: Sticking with a 2, as Wiz Kids will not replace the damaged cards and will only replace 5 of the dice unless the rep can get "special permission".  I deem this too much trouble to go through to get what I paid for in the first place, so I'm chalking this one up as a loss of $60 for me, and a loss of a customer for them.

RATING: 5
A deck builder with dice.  I'd rather use cards - while I love rolling lots of dice, special dice don't excite me.

When building a 'deck', you get to put in lush pictures into your deck usually - here, you put in new dice with special symbols on them - just not as exciting to me.

Also, the random monsters chosen created a combo that, while not unbalancing, was degenerate, since it dragged on the game an extra 30% longer than was fun.

Not bad, but for a light (not deep thinking) game, it didn't excite me.

Love the idea, and this is a fun game, but the implementation feels a bit bland. The dice don't feel balanced (i.e. quake dragon and defender of the pale are ridiculously good) and decisions are minimal. Still, it's a whole load of dice and manages to be fun despite those problems. Much more luck based than I had hoped it would be.

It's a fun game and the mechanic is great, however I don't really enjoy it as much as I wanted to. It's proven again that I am a BAD dice roller.

Reasons for not buying it even for the overall fun of it:

1) The dice should be a little bit larger, as all those small print are not easy to read. Although I can refer to the card anytime, it's troublesome to do it from time to time.
2) The Artwork on the Card is great, the quality of craving on the dice is a totally different standard.

For a game that is costly at that price, the fun factor do not balance well with it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
The new take on deckbuilding is a huge commercial success, I hear. I suspect this is mainly due to the fact that, for a MSRP of 50 EUR, one gets 130 custom dice (along with many cards - more than one per type of die - and some other stuff). That is very impressive, even for non-geeks!
The game itself is a pretty decent filler, of course very luck driven, but funny enough to be enjoyed even by the eurogamer in me. The tactile sensation of putting a hand in a bag full of dice is not a thing that a true geek can dismiss so easily...
With more than two players the game gets slightly better. My rating is a 4 with two, and 5 with three or four players.

Update may 7th, 2012: I found a couple of variants on BGG forums (Advanced Capture Rule, The Totally Expert Rule of Culling), that will be officially released with the Quarmageddon expansion. Those variants definitely improve the game, mitigate luck and add some more strategy to the game. With them, the rating of Quarriors! raises to a full 5.5.

RATING: 10
Note: After first few plays, we have been playing with the 2 buy per turn variant.

Got the game this week, and have already played over thirty times. Although there is a good amount of randomness (the winner is not always the person who played the best) there is more meaningful strategy here than in Dominion. I usually feel that once you have reached a certain level of mastery of Dominion moves become fairly obvious, and there is no level of interaction. In this game there are meaningful decisions every turn, there is more interaction, and turns go by faster. I strongly dislike the three minute turns in dominion where one player is playing tons of random crap, drawing, and in the end buys a colony and then the next person does the same thing. This game gets rid of that. Games last roughly twenty minutes and all of it is interesting.

Without the two buy rule there is significantly less decision, but with two buys it is often unclear what the optimal play is. I find that this rule makes the game remain short yet have as much strategy and meaningful decisions per minute as game I have played.

Initial Impression: Deck building with dice? This game had almost no theme for me. Having to pull out the dice from a bag every turn and rolling them was just too fiddly for me. Also, by having to roll the dice at the beginning of your turn rather than at the end you cannot pre-plan your decisions.

2/17/2014: I lost to my 13-year-old...again. She is still undefeated. What's her strategy? She mimics me. Instead of reading the cards, she assumes that anything I buy will be a good choice. So she buys them too. Then she gets a better roll than me and it's all over too quickly. It's time to make her play with the advanced rules. With the simple rules, by the time you feel like you've built a fairly good deck of dice, it's already over. I still love this game and I am always wanting to play it. It's basically crack for a lover of dice games.

I am enough of a fan of this game that I even picked up two of the expansions after only playing it once.  It's a deck building game, but with dice.  The core game doesn't have a ton of depth to it and there is a lot of luck involved.  But that essentially makes it a good casual game where it could be anybody's victory at any time.  I like to keep a good selection of games where the experienced players and the new comers are just about on even ground.  This is an excellent example of that type of game.  In the midst of all the luck of the draw and the roll, there still is enough decision making to make it strategic as well.  Like with any good deck building style game, if you don't stack your deck with the good stuff and clean out the garbage, you won't have much of a chance.  I love this game.  I love the dice.  I love the character cards.  And I love that it pays fairly quickly (under an hour).

Very unique, first of its genre and probably not the last or the best, but a pioneer with a great deal of strategy coupled with the gambling instinct of rolling tons of beautiful custom dice.  Built-in player interaction in monsters attacking each-other for victory points and "culling" (trashing) die from your bag are both interesting strategies not present in mainstream deck-building games, which this strongly resembles (notably Dominion).  Dominion is the stronger game but I still heartily recommend Quarriors when your deck-builder loving group wants something a little different.

EDIT: So apparently in "May 2012" I just decided to transcribe Tom Vasel's opinions as my own on these reviews.  Bumping this one down a point, it isn't that great.

The game delivers exactly what it promises. Dicebuilding! It has the same selling points a game like Dominion has but in additions it has tons of dice. And dice are cool. I like the design where the dice are used for different varieties of monsters/spells. This keeps the components managable while preserving the most possible variety. As you can expect with a dice game there is some luck involved but mostly this will even out in the end. Mostly the player who recognizes the best possible combos in the dice pool will win against somebody just rolling well. The only complaints I have is that the dice are too small and the game is over too quickly. But the last issue can be solved by simply playing to a higher amount of points.

more complex dice game, has something from deckbuilding, but you build your own dice pool. 
Because of all the nice dices and ideas, we already have two expansions^^

One can play it very competitive or more friendly, as one like.

If you win its strategy; if you lose its the dice.  I love this game.  The randomness allows the game to just be fun without having to be serious.  It only works with a group that is willing to lose to luck.  The variety provided by the different cards for each set of dice allows for no two games being the same.

Dominion is still my only real experience with deck-building, so I'm not burned out. In fact I'm still in love with the mechanism. However I've been reluctant to venture into any of the other games with this mechanism because I usually hear that Dominion just does it better. However, when I heard "dice-building game," that seemed different enough to hook me. I've read a lot of opinions on this game, and most of them seem to be in the love-it or hate-it camp, but I guess I'm one of the rare cases because I'm just kind of indifferent towards the game. I want to love it because the mechanism is so enjoyable and I love dice-rolling games. In fact this game has provided plenty of smiles already as I see people get that great roll (or that horrendous roll.) Yet I find myself often frustrated with the execution. The smaller dice are annoying, and the bags are horrible, but my #1 complaint is simply the cards. I mean, I like the fact that they provide variety, but since key information that players need on almost every turn are on those cards it can be a real pain having them in the middle of the table being shared by all the players. Also, since there are multiple versions of each creature/spell, you can't easily memorize what one does because it may be different from the way it was the last game. My final complaint is that the endgame is somewhat anti-climactic. By the very nature of the point-scoring a player will just be sitting there for an entire round with enough points to win and it becomes a round of "is someone lucky enough to stop her?" Some of these issues may become less noticeable and frustrating with further plays, but for now I just can't get on the love-it train.

Beer and pretzels meet Dominion-ized Yahtzee. I think this helps Yahtzee's reputation and hurts Dominion's. I played it once and would play it again. I like that it is non-threatening and could easily work as an entry point for all sorts of people. Could also work as a family game with kids not otherwise interested in more complicated games.

Quarriors becomes redundant after a few plays and does not scratch any particular itch for me. Then again, I'm more of a Euro snoot.

Score: 6, based on original rules.  Score: 6, based on variant rules.  Maybe culling needs to be easier than assistants only?

Note to self: try variant where creatures return to the Wilds when scored (you do not have to cull them.)  Scoring still allows culling.  You may buy any number of creature dice per turn but only 1 spell die per turn (spells get buffed since they do not return to the Wilds.)  Allow re-roll of dice by expending 1 die.  Flip 9 creatures and 4 spells during set-up.  Depletion of 4 creature piles ends the game.  Start player gets -1 Quid, 2nd 0, 3rd +1, 4th +2.

Suffers a bit from down-time, since people have to draw and roll but maybe it was the group I was playing with.  The rules should have been designed so that you don't need to worry about your "discard" pile, so you can always be immediately ready to draw.

The summon creatures then buy doesn't work that well, since people need to know what they're going to do with the quiddity before they summon.

There is a lack of combos, since at least Nightfall you need to find what colors you want to combo.  (And Martial Law gives you a bunch of Kickers.)

4 plays.  First game, I was player 1 and I won.  Second game, player 2 won.  (I was player 4.)

3rd play: variant, 3rd player won.

4th play: original, 2nd player (me) won.

For the 4th play, people agreed the game might benefit from the designer's culling variant.

Game suffers from a bit of downtime.

Rolling poorly sucks, of course.  Multiple buys definitely makes the game better, IMO.  Definitely seems to be a runaway leader problem.

Declaring an attack value is easy and convenient.

I do like the idea of multiple buys, discarding a die to re-roll any number of dice (or just one), and Assistants being the only dice that cull when scoring.  Limiting creatures to killing only one creature may slow down the game, because then each die would have to declare what its attacking.  Perhaps big creatures should be limited to killing one creature, and you just "chump block" with assistants or some such.

Multiple buys may nerf big creatures, but is the cumulative +1 cost per additional die necessary?

Enjoyable, good components, but after my first play, I wonder if it becomes too luck-based in the final rounds.

UPDATE: There's a definite mix of strategy (collecting the right dice) and luck (pulling the right dice/rolling the right things). It gives the end game a little bit of an anticlimactic feel, but luck is also the nature of the game.

Very similar to Dominion in mechanics, but drags down a little as you don't do anything with your downtime (Dominion you examine your hand and plan), and the cards are all at the center of the table (too hard to read/see from far away, so you miss a lot of the flavor).  Fun dice rolling though.

Quarriors is a dice lover’s paradise: you collect buckets of dice and roll them, the more the better. Therefore, as usual when dice are involved, there’s no foolproof strategy a bad roll can’t spoil but who cares? The real fun here is rolling dice and see what happens.

Comparisions with Dominion are incorrect and correct at the same time: actually both games make for a deck/pool building customization (and here surely Quarriors owes much to Dominion), yet where Dominion enables to reduce randomness to an acceptable level anyhow, Quarriors’ strength is right in the unpredictability of every roll.

Undoubtedly Quarriors is far from perfect but as undoubtedly it makes for a great filler as well.

RATING: 7
So yeah, Quarriors. I'm a Eurogamer and I'm liable to look at any blatant Dominion clone as just that. Whether Thunderstone ("It's Dominion as a dungeon delve!"), Puzzle Strike ("It's Dominion with chips! And you can hurt people!") or Quarriors ("It's Dominion with dice! And you can hurt people!"), these are all clearly derivative, and not nearly as good, as the original. Not to say I dislike them, but I value simplicity and originality, and they simply don't measure up to Dominion (and I'm not even a huge Dominion fan).

Well, one can try to rate games based on how objectively "good" a game is, judging only the qualities one sees in a rulebook, or one can rate games based on the experiences playing it. I know people such as the former, who will play a game with me and laugh and have a rollicking good time with it, then go on BGG the next day and rate it 4/10. I don't quite get that, you had a great time and the game directly facilitated that. If I played a game and had fun, I'll give the game credit for that.

Based on the former "objective" rating (well, based on my subjective attempts to be objective), I'd probably rate Quarriors 6/10 on BGG. But it [i]is[/i] fun. The dice create tension -- can I roll well enough to destroy his creatures and keep him from winning? -- and moments of groans, though unfortunately not necessarily matching cheers.

Like Dominion, the variability helps the game shine. It is clever how the same dice can represent different creatures game to game, to add more variability to a game that only has a very limited number of differing dice. But even with many plays it is impossible to remember what, for example, the Questing Wizard does, because there's three different versions of the Wizard with one to three different special powers each. Which one is in this game? Read the wall of text on the card in the middle of the table, with no helpful icons or even bolded keywords like "When Scoring", "When Summoned" or "When Destroyed" to remind you when you need to care about those. This is a single point of frustration with the game, but it's a big one, and one that will likely keep me playing the iOS version more than face to face.

Well, the game IS fun. Maybe more outright, obvious fun than Dominion. I borrowed it to show my 8yo son, who quickly gets bored of any simple German-style game I put in front of him, and he quickly took to this and it is now probably his favourite game. The game works very well as a 2-player game, though 3p is likely ideal.

The game comes with two advanced variants. Normally this sort of thing I wouldn't even look twice at, but you should look at these. One grants an extra buy on your turn, which is such an obvious improvement without increasing complexity that it should be the standard way of playing for everyone. The other transforms the game from a quick "what the hell" game to a more drawn-out "work your way up" game; both work well and one should feel comfortable playing whichever sounds more suitable to their play styles.

The game is not polished. It has many rough edges, but it is from these rough edges that much of the fun emerges. When I try to look at this objectively, I must concede that Dominion is the better game, and the one I would probably be first to choose among it and its many descendants. But with my son I have played this many times and have not tired of it, so its rating shoots up in my book.

RATING: 10
Updated to a 10 because it is better than everything.  Tons of variability in game play, no two games are alike.

Quarriors is a deckbuilding game but with dice.  You start with a set of 12 basic terrible die and work to remove "bad" die in order to purchase a better overall set.  Dragons, wizards, and other awesome creature die do various attack and damage values and score you glory (points) as you go.  Throw some spells into your set in order to add other perks and upgrades.  

Very cool concept that produces balanced play, multiple paths to victory, and limitless replayability/variation.  The expansions open up the game even more and I purchased Quarmageddon after only 5 plays of the original.  It's that good.  I had to have more.  

Note: Quarmageddon comes with a very valuable tray to hold all of the dice.  Without the expansion they are stored in tiny baggies that will have you sneakily leaving the room when finished so your buddy has to clean up the game.

Con's - I docked one point for a few reasons.  Some of the die can be overpowering.  The scorecard is bad.  The container to store everything in the original game is pathetic.  Some of the effects of the creature cards can be confusing and/or overwhelming to where it slows gameplay.  Constantly refreshing what the various die capabilities are.

All in all -  AWESOME GAME which led to insta-addiction for me.

B&N.  Finally got it to the table after many months on the shelf.  Enjoyable game.  Very simple, and sort of a preamble to the dice masters.  The long box storage is very nice.  I am currently using the quartifacts box to store my D and D dice masters.

If you are choosing between this or dice masters, it's a tough call.  Quarriors is self contained and easy to teach.  Non-collectible, so no worries about hunting rare cards.  Quarriors come with decent draw bags, which dice masters does not.  My small hands can barely reach into those dice masters bags.  What Dice Masters gives that Quarriors does not, is deeper strategy.  Up front customization of your team and more complicated battle makes dice masters a lot more strategic and deep (relatively).

Have only played twice now but first thoughts are there is more strategy than it looks at first and that it's very equivalent in all respect to Dominion (just as light with just as many decisions and just as much player interaction). The dice are very cool and there's lots of variability in the set up each game. Promos are cool and looking forward to more expansions (which I hear are in the works already). The game plays fairly quickly even with 4 players at around 30 minutes, even less at times. Pretty fun little game and if you like deck building games it can hold it's own with any of them.

Edit after 2nd day of gaming and 6 more games under my belt. This game is absolutely wonderful! There is waaaay more depth and strategy than the game shows at first. My group has been having an absolute blast with this game. For example on the last roll or the last game tonight everyone was standing up, leaning over the table as I rolled my dice. When I pulled out the 3 Glory points for the win they all jumped up and laughed. Lots of pats on the back and "great job!" all around. Fun, fun, game. Very tense and just...well, fun. Don't see this one going away anytime soon. We're all hooked on it and we're finding lots of different strategies to win all the time.

Conceptually, this is a good/interesting game, but it often feels unbalanced.  There also send to be a rich-get-richer problem in that expensive monsters are hard to kill and worth lots of glory points.  I'm anxious to try a house rule where every monster is worth only 1 glory point (or maybe wimpy monsters are worth more than tough ones).

This is a VERY fun game!  Definitely reminds me of the excitement and fun when I first learned Dominion.  I really appreciate the luck factor in this game... certainly the more expensive dice are better, but they always have that 1 crappy side!  We had a ton of fun with this one!

The more I think about this game the more I LOVE it.  Dominion is an amazing game and I have friends that COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND it.  I would put those guys up against any players anywhere and they would win more often than not.  But, although playing Dominion with them is satisfying and awe inspiring, over time it lacks ... fun.

QUARRIORS IS FUN!

Nothing beats the feeling of pulling JUST THE RIGHT combination of dice and actually rolling what you need to crush your opponent's dream of winning HIS FIRST GAME.  (Brent just needed to score his ready Creatures to win, but I pulled a "win" spell and stole the victory just before his turn :-)

And just as much fun: Steve pulling 2 dragons and the rest of us smirking because Dragons hate steve and all steve rolls with them is 1 Quiddity :-)  Oh god, that was fun.

I MUST HAVE THIS GAME!

Well I prefer it to Dominion (although that's not saying much as I really don't like Dominion). 

It's too light and the dice icons are too tiny for my eyes, is that a '1' or a 2 etc (making the pictures bigger on the cards at least would have helped!)

I like the idea - and a bag of dice is so much more tactile and fun than 'shuffle' 'shuffle' shuffle'

Luck of the roll is obviously present - but that isn't my problem with the game, the fact you're limited to l die purchase a turn and have nothing else to do with the resource means there is little reason not to buy the most expensive die you can each turn.

Add the 'rich get richer' element of culling your used dice and the whole experience is a bit meh ... everything is rather obvious.

So in summary - nothing objectionable, but nothing grabs me to want to play again (or own a copy). Solid '5'

Simple fun.  Kind of like Lays Potato Chips..you can't just eat one.  With this game you can't just play one game.  And it's quick enough to allow multiple plays.  The chaos of the dice and the agony/ecstasy nature of either having your best laid plans go to waste with a disastrous roll or witnessing the same happen to your opponent and the laughs that ensue is the draw here.  The Expert Variant brings some more tactical options as well as game length.

I love all of the dice-rolling combined with the deck-building aspect of other games (only with DICE!) Even though it doesn't seem like there is much variation with the included spells and creatures, it really does have a lot of replayability and the chances of a game mirroring another is pretty slim. Can't wait for the expansion to come out lol!

The luck aspect of the game sometimes conflicts with the strategy which can be frustrating. Several plays and the strategic options sort of turn ambiguous.

A neat twist on the deck-building trope.  I like it.  While it seems often to be apparent who will win mid way through the game it is not always a foregone conclusion - and it plays extremely quickly - meaning that several games can be played back to back very easily.

Great value.

The better Dominion...with dice.
Quarriors is easy and fast played. Even the "same" card (name and artwork are the same) exists in different variants, so even playing with the "same" creature still is a new experience...
It's a good diversion for all the same deck building.

Still just deckbuilding, only slightly worse because I can't read the cards for the powers, I have to lean over the table...

Fun for what it is, but maybe it will be seen as a step back when all the bling starts to rust...

Revised down to a 5 - I am not really getting to memorize the cards with all the randomization. "Game of the Year" hardly - moreso than Dominion - this is just a fad.

Dominion meets Dragon Dice. And it works. Of course, luck plays a DOMINANT role in the games, so be warned. Strategies may be heavily compromised by a pair of "bad" rolls (actually, if you get just Quiddity with your dice you can't even score points, the very opposite of Dominion. Most probably some kind of "Spend X quiddity - get 1 Glory" basic card would have been useful, just like the Cultist in Ascension. Nice game, yet not the BIG game I expected. Curious to see how it develops.

This was a delightful surprise. I wasn't a big fan of Dominion, and after being on the fence for a few months I had finally decided I wasn't going to get this, but my husband surprised me with it (plus all expansions!) for my birthday. It's really a fun, light game with a much more attractive theme, much more interactive gameplay, and a much less fiddly mechanic than Dominion (no shuffling!).

I really like that you score your creatures and then remove them at the beginning of your turn: it makes you less attached to your dice so you (almost) never get upset when they get killed off during your opponents' attack. The spells and special creature abilities are very cool, and the dice look awesome, even if a little on the cheap side.

This reminds me of a cross between Dominion and MtG.  Be warned: it has dice!  Some people are complaining that there is too much luck in the game, so I thought I would point out the dice thing.  There is a fair amount of randomness in the game, but I still find it quite fun.

RATING: 9
The premise (deckbuilding with dice) works surprisingly well.  It is fun figuring out combinations that work together and there are some interesting tradeoffs between scoring potential and deck acceleration.  I like it, but don't get fooled: it is a dice-fest.  No amount of strategy will overcome the randomness of the dice.  Think Roll Through the Ages, not Dominion.

RATING: 8
I do like Quarriors quite a bit, but there are degenerate creature layouts. The Dragon can be a problem generally, especially the one that can't be attacked by anything less than level 3 given that means you are only vulnerable to other dragons. It's possible to get lucky and get one on your first turn, which can be nasty. Also, the Ghost that allows you to burn basic Quiddity dice to keep alive can be extremely powerful. I'm probably 10 games in and have seen a couple unsatisfying mixes, so it's not a huge problem - but it does come up. Like Thunderstone, you're going to want to keep an eye on the mix of creatures & spells once you get into the game and make sure they look reasonable. A few creatures may end up getting banned around here. In general, I'm not sure I'm totally comfortable with some variants of the Questing Wizard and Quake Dragon.

Also, this game is very fast. You're probably only buying 6-10 dice before you need to have everything important to your mix. Long-term basically does not exist. Which is fine, this is a game that needs to be short, but you need to be aware of it.

We played a couple 4-player games where we played to 15 instead of 12, and that seemed to work pretty well. The game seemed to play out more satisfactorily.
---
3 players seems to be the sweet spot for me out of the box; the 4-player game seems to be over to soon. Last time we played with four there was the suggestion that we should simply play to 15 points (the 3-player target) instead of 12 with 4 players, and to me that sounds right. We'll give that a try next time.
---
Quarriors has a lot going for it: fast, fun, lots of dice. As I play it more, I see a few patterns that some gamers are obviously not going to like: rolling well (getting a lot of Quiddity during your first time through your pool, mainly) can be a big deal. Getting early scores, when culling can help you a lot, can be similarly swingy. You can buy big creatures and then due to the luck of the dice they never show.

You know what, though? Dominion and Thunderstone have the exact same issues. Quarriors just makes them appear more significant because of the dice luck. You're going to see powerful cards in Dominion or Thunderstone. Often as not you may not be able to use them situationally, but at least you saw them.

Anyway, Quarriors is a dice game, and it has properties of dice games. You want to put yourself in the best position to succeed, knowing that the dice may not come through. You want to identify good risks. Like Dominion and Thunderstone, you need to identify powerful but simple and workable combinations, manage your ratio of creatures to Quiddity. Unlike Dominion and Thunderstone, Quarriors really does play in 20 minutes and gives you a lot of bang for your gaming buck in terms of interest, excitement, and engagement.

RATING: 6
Pretty darn cool idea!  You can't deny the absolute awesomeness of the product!  The dice are just plain sweet!

However, I didn't enjoy the gameplay quite as much as many deck-building games it was based on; I felt like there weren't as many opportunities for dice synergies as there are for synergistic decks in many deck-building games.  There also seem to be turn order issues and potential runaway leader problems.  Perhaps this will be improved through expansions.

Overall, I'd probably give the gameplay around a 5 or 6, but I'll stick with 6 due to the sheer impressiveness of the product!  One of those weird games where the components really make the game, despite the shortcomings of the game itself.

This was a another new-to-me game that is not strictly.  It is a classic snowball, rich get-richer game.  With dice!  Those who know me well know that dice games are not my strong suit, and though we played a longer session (playing to 15 points, I believe) I was still completely shut out at game end, due to some unfortunate die rolling.

[thing=91536][/thing] is not exactly a bad game; lots of modern Euro games are mindless snowballing points engines. And for those who enjoy the cartoonish art work and the lampooning of classic fantasy genres, it could be a pleasant and enjoyable experience. However, this is not a game for me. I enjoy quite a bit more thinking in my games. Although the [thing=36218]Dominion[/thing]-esque nature of the game was expected, the volatility of the game that accompanied the die rolling was not. I had hoped it would provide a little more player control to enable true competition.  I hesitate to even call the decision-space tactical, as the options seemed too few and too arbitrary from turn to turn.  Although the game was not unpleasant in any way, this is not a game I will need to try again.  [b][BGCOLOR=#ff66cc][COLOR=#ff66cc]_[/COLOR]4[COLOR=#ff66cc]_[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR][/b].

This isn't a bad choice if you want some mindless fun. But it is just that - mindless.

The creature system is an interesting way to try and provide conflict, but still doesn't end up feeling THAT interactive since once you get a dude out there's usually nothing you can do for him except hope. Maybe you can cast a spell.

This game compounds luck with yet more luck. Not only can you draw poorly, but you can roll poorly too. This sounds like the main problem with the game but unfortunately there are far more insidious problems at work here...

First, there really isn't much in the way of interesting decisions. The first game might seem fun but I assure you with each successive play and the more you explore the deck your interest will dwindle. The only real choice to make on any given turn is what to buy, and choices tend to be pretty obvious. Unlike most deck builders, this is not a combo building game. Cards effects just don't connect in interesting ways.

Second, the game has a runaway leader problem. First person to have a couple good creatures survive (getting good creatures and getting them out are both the result of luck) gets some VP and gets to cull some dice, making them more likely to get more creatures out to get more VP and make it harder for anyone else to get a creature out so that they can get some VP and cull some dice. And if you're playing in a game with a Dragon? Might as well call it game when someone buys one, they're just going to win anyway.

We tried playing a couple games to double VP to help with the runaway leader issue. It helped a little, but not enough.

Third, almost everything about the balance just feels off. The creatures that score their owners the most VP are also the hardest for anyone else to kill. I get the thinking behind it, but in practice it just doesn't work. Especially because how did they get that creature again? Oh right they got a lucky roll.

On the plus side, all the colored dice are very pretty.

I really didn't like this game. It didn't click with me or my group.  The instructions are terrible.  We had to watch a "how to" video just to figure out how to start the game because the instructions were so vague and confusing.  Once we figured out everything, it turned into just a random dice fest.  "Oh great, several rolls of nothing but quiddity... I'm now totally out of the game"

We'll try a couple of more games just to make sure we're not missing something, however, I'm betting this will end up as trade bait.

Edit:  Upgraded rating from 3.5 to 5.  Once you get used to capabilities of all creatures/spells it opens up more gameplay.  It still has issues regarding unlucky dice rolls at beginning dooming you for rest of game.

Meet Quarriors: Dominion’s dice cousin! The way to build your deck reminds me quite a lot of Dominion. However, it’s not quite the same, as you create monsters which can attack and will score VPs if they are alive when it’s your turn again. That’s a completely different mechanic than that of Dominion, and I like this aggressiveness.

I honestly didn’t think that I would like it as much as I did as I’m not a big fan of dice based games, but this was a pleasant surprise when you take it for what it is; you cannot win with a great strategy if you roll badly and vice versa, but it’s okay as it’s a very quick game. I would buy it if I could solve these two things: it would probably not be played as much because of the theme and the fact that Dominion is easier to introduce to nongamers, and then because of the awful box which doesn’t fit on my shelves at all...

Heavy dice game. The dice are also very small so it's hard to see what's on the dice.

I would play it again but I am not really interested in this one.

I am starting to like dice games more and more, as the dice themselves become the "decision making" tool (rather than another random item generator that contributes nothing more than a "spaces to move" or "I beat you in combat" mechanic that most dice are used for).  When dice rolling becomes the main mechanic, and the decisions are focused around that randomness, then it becomes a stronger game.  Quariors does that quite nicely.

I wasn't sure what I thought about this game initially, but I've decided it's quite enjoyable for what it is.  You really need to use the advanced/optional rules for culling what you score, and being able to buy one or two dice per turn.  This introduces more strategy than always buying the most expensive thing and always scoring it.  Without it, whoever rolls best early will usually run away with the game.  Great little dice, and a fun time.

I like games where rolling dice is a big mechanic and Quarriors is just that.  A dice building game where you purchase from a pool in the middle to try to outscore you opponents.

So I played this under less than ideal circumstances, so take this with a big grain of salt, but this seemed excessively fiddily (special rules, which are a pain to remember if I am to keep the game moving at a reasonable pace, for every creature) when I wanted elegance, and excessively simplistic (strategic decisions about e.g. what to buy seem less subtle and thinky than those in other deckbuilders) when I wanted interesting choices to make. Feels like Dominion for people for whom it's not a Real Game unless it has monsters and dice. Pass.

I love dice and deck building so naturally this one is a hit with me. The advanced rules are the way to go to add a little more strategy to the game. There was little reason not to buy the most expensive die you could afford every turn. The "double random" element created from the luck of the draw and the roll of the dice doesn't bother me and can create some great dramatic moments.

My biggest gripe is the unclear rules for some of the creature abilities and spells. They are a little to vague and some of the powers just flat out suck.

It seemed way to short.  When I see the high priced monsters out there and the available spells, I would think there would be time to power up a deck.  I was wrong.  Also, the scoring card can be frustrating since it is counter-intuitive.  I ended up moving backwards at least once when I should have scored.

I was excited when this came out. It really sounded like a fun idea - dice building instead of deck building.

however when it gets to the table, it really falls flat. it doesn't feel like you make choices and (while i guess this should have been obvious ), it's super random.

the game ends too quickly, the player that gets to an early lead, nearly always wins.

the game is best with 4 players and really bad with 2.

RATING: 4
Quarriors (no explanation point from me...maybe for Age of Steam(!) but never for a game like this) is a dice based resource management game that has some similarities to the deck building games that have been common recently.

Painting with broad strokes, players start out with dice that produce the basic resource for the game. Those dice are then used to buy more dice, which can have the ability to produce more resources, to give the players special powers, or which can be turned into beasties which score VPs if they live an entire round.

Beasties have a basic power and toughness stat, and any of them that are summoned during a player's turn immediately go on the rampage. Their power stat is summed, and then goes up against each other player's creatures clockwise around the table, with each player putting forward defenders one at a time (cue mental image of an army at the gates demanding a champion and some poor sap being hurriedly shoved out the door to get pounded with its companions hoping that the attackers get tired from beating on the poor sod so hard), if their defence is equal to or lower than the remaining power of the attacker, they die, go into the used pool and temporarily reduce the offensive power of the attacker, though attackers never suffer damage or death. Basically, the entire goal is to get creatures to come out, make the rounds killing off the potential point scoring pieces from the other players, and to then survive long enough to score for you. Most everything else is just fluff or extra special rules.

The end of all of this seems like it can anti-climatically come rather soon, and a good deal of the ability to score points seems to hinge on getting the right mix of monsters to resources into the bag, then pulling out the right mix of dice, and then getting the right stuff to roll so you can put out a decent-sized army, trash everyone elses' stuff, and then score a lot of points in the process. Probabilities can be used to make this more likely, but there are still a lot of random factors that go into it. Not really offensive, and easy to play after the initial game, but nothing that speaks to me in any particular way either. Not dissimilar to Roll Through the Ages for me, a not particularly good game that is saved from being outright terrible mostly by being short.

RATING: 7
Likes: A nice change to the deck-building genre. Rolling tons of dice is just physically stimulating.

Dislikes: It always seems like the first player to (usually luckily) roll enough quiddity to buy the available 8-cost creature is most likely to win. Mighty Defender of the Pale stacking is also very annoying.

Quarriors has left me with a very unique impression.  At first glance, I thought the game would be pretty bad.  But after playing it, I was pleasantly surprised and found the mechanics to be quite engaging.  The game feels much more interactive than your standard deck-builder because you're rolling and adding dice to your bag, and the dice add randomness.

The big problem I have with the game is that due to the low amount of Victory Points needed to win, it boils down to who gets the first big set of creatures to stick.  In that regard, the game is almost strictly luck-based, and it puts a damper on what could be a more strategic element.  The 15 point scoreboard is just too low.  Increasing it to 20 helps, but even then sometimes the person who would've gotten the 15 points, also qualifies for 20 since he'll get 8 victory points for his big group of creatures.  When someone reaches 15 or 20, the game feels like it's over prematurely and most of the time you don't get to use your cool combos yet.

I'd like to try this one at say, 40 victory points.  That would give all of the players time to catch up, and maybe see a few lead swings.  It would also allow a player's special combos to shine, such as the ones that destroy opponent creatures when entering play.

I like the game a lot, but the victory point total needs to be modified for me to justify playing it.

A nice novel take on the "deck-building" genre using dice instead of cards. Ultimately it is a pretty big luck-fest and the results of games can't be taken too seriously. What I love this game for is the smack-talk that it engenders in a group of people sitting around the table as your stupid dragon die coughs up a meagre 1 Quiddity instead of a chunk of creature smashing power. Don't play it expecting a strong feeling of strategic mastery.

RATING: 6
All around great! The concept of building a dice pool is really innovative. Not only do you get to roll dice, but you get to use similar strategies from Dominion or Thunderstone. Also, the components and custom dice are top notch. 

edit: Looses a point due to the lack of organized storage in the base set.

if you are unhappy with the culling rule, play that you can only cull the creature you score, and that you have the option of keeping the creature and not scoring it if you feel that is the strategic thing to do. If you score it though, it goes back into the wilds. If you are unhappy with the buy rule, play that you can buy up to 2 dice a turn instead of 1. This makes your buy choices much more diverse.

It was fun, but I felt that it lacked... something. Maybe 12 starting dice is too much. There is a lot of potential in the quarry dice, but the special abilities could have been more varied. It probably becomes more interesting with the expansions, but I'd still gladly play it again.

Not sure if I'd want to play face to face, but the iOS app is kinda fun. Although I can't figure out what it doesn't auto defend when there are no choices to be me made--which is most of the time. It's basically a deck building, but with dice instead of cards, and the dice get rolled giving you potentially different "versions" of the same card. But the new thing here is that most of the cards you buy are "creatures", which you can put into play, and score VP for you if they're still alive when your next turn comes around. And every time you put creatures into play, they attack all other creatures in play (creatures having both attack/defense values), so you don't really want to put creatures into play unless you can kill other creatures in play, or more commonly, expect them to survive coming back around to you.

SECOND EDITION RULES COMMENTS:

This is a great game for young teens.  It crosses both the fun of Dominion strategy with light combat with special powers.  There is a lot of luck in what dice come out when and what faces are available to be used, so it isn't real deep in strategy.  However, the game play is simple enough to get younger people involved.  

I've updated my rating to a 7 from a 4.

ORIGINAL FIRST EDITION RULES COMMENTS:

Comments based on 2 plays with 1st Edition rules.

This game is really not for me.  A bit too heavy on the luck spectrum and not enough options per turn.  Nice concepts, but the flow/purpose/options needs some work.

Have always loved dice in games ameritrashy as it may be. But that is an element every true gamer should be able to cope with. Your taking yourself too seriously if you feel that randomness in a game breaks it. In this game dice and deck building concepts blend perfectly. Quarriors broke my fascination with Dominion and is leading the race for my play time. My sons request this alot which is fine by me. Chaos Progenitus used to be my monster dice game of choice. Just hope they churn out some more expansions for variety.

I’ll admit it, I like rolling some dice.  I enjoy it in my RPGs and I enjoy it in a lot of my games.  I also highly enjoy card games.  They’ve mixed both fairly well into Quarriors!  It’s not a perfect game; you’ll bump into mechanics that’ll make you stumble.  Other players will help you move past them though, and sitting down to enjoy a light game, such as this, is never bad.  

It has a fast pace, more-so once you’ve learned the cards, and gives the feel of just a light-hearted time.  The games can take as fast as 10 minutes with the right dice on the field, and if you can get the players into the feel of the game they’ll be cheers and laughter.  I have a blast playing this game anytime of the day.

There's a visceral enjoyment in playing with colored dice, and the game itself is rather more fun than I would have guessed going into it: I'm not generally a fan of "see what happens" games, and there's an awful lot of "see what happens" here. (The two major decisions in the game are "which rolled monsters do I pay to summon?" and "what do I buy?", which seem to often have straightforward answers.) And the "no shuffling" isn't a selling point for me; I actually find the physical mechanisms of Dominion faster than those of Quarriors. 

But nonetheless: oddly fun, despite all the randomness.

[8/11: Another 3 plays and my interest in the game as published is waning fast. Adding a few house rules has helped keep it engaging, though.]

Surprisingly, I like this a little bit more than Dominion. Maybe because the dryness of Dominion, and the tense created when you roll the dice. The variable setup is quite nice too. Unfortunately, because the nature of the dice, it's also harder to form strategy here, making me cannot score it higher.

Components: Cool dice that need to be bigger. Cool artwork on cards that need to be bigger. Cool bags that need to be bigger. What, is this the travel edition? Everything is in miniature!

Experience: Fairly streamlined rules system, i.e. we had few rules questions.

Rolling dice is fun. If I roll one of my big bads, it's an obvious choice to summon. Otherwise, there are some interesting decisions about which dice to re-roll, and/or creatures/spells to capture.

Very luck-driven. I'd need to play more to see if strategy is favored; right now I think luck is favored (i.e. the luckiest player wins).

I really like this game, but I'm not sure it quite got the Dice Dominion thing right. The game seems too short to get your engine running and the luck factor can be a little annoying. There are ways to counteract bad rolls, but in such a short game, there's not much time to catch up.

Lots of variety in this tin, which comes chalk full of custom dice.  The dice alone make it worth the price.  I recommend using the 2 variants in the Quarmaggedon expansion rulebook, as it takes the game to another level.  The base rules are too light for my tastes, and one player can ride a lucky early roll to victory.  Much more strategy in the official variants, even though its still a dice game.  And who doesn't like rolling dice?!

Less fun than it looks like it should be with all those cool dice.  For a start, the dice are on the small side.  Second the 'dice deck building' mechanic feels a bit forced - it just doesn't feel the same as collecting/building a hand of cards, probably because the dice rolling means the 'hand' rarely performs as you hoped it would.  Much better is King of Tokyo if you are looking for Yahtzee with monsters.

Plays like a deckbuilding game (Dominion, Thunderstone) but instead of shuffling cards all day long they give you this tiny little bag that you try to pull your dice out of.  Unless you have very little hands this is nearly impossible.

Aside from that its a quality game that is fast and engaging.  With slower players, and a bad draw of cards, a game can take 40 minutes.  With a standard draw of cards the games usually take 20 minutes or so.

This is a gorgeous game with a TON of dice to roll, if that's your thing then you'll love this.

The quality of all the components is fantastic, I really like the metal tin that it all comes in (shaped and designed to look like one of the dice from the game).

It has some minor flaws, there's not that much room for a grand strategy in the base game, generally buying the most expensive choices you can afford each round (with some exceptions) will help you to victory, and by its nature there is a lot of randomness. If you don't mind that and want something very tactile that's fast and fun I highly recommend.

Dominion clone with dice instead of cards, No shuffling, more agressive than Dominion, the basic idea is to summon creature to attack other player. However less combos.

Average production quality.
Poor rules, with "humour" and many real life words changed to start with a 'Q..'. Though the game is simple to play the rules are a pain to read/
Fun to play, but maybe less variations and depth than Dominion. Quarriors is much quicker, so dice added to your pool may be used only twice ot thrice before the end.
You can also increase the target victory points for a longer game.

Even with the added randomness, this is better than Dominion simply because of the lack of having to shuffle cards.

The container (tin) it comes in is strange, and the "Q" terminology is just plain lame, but I can get over that in order to enjoy this game. And really, "uber" without the umlaut? ;)  The dice draw bags are small and more sized for childrens' hands.

The last criticism I have is the teeny-tiny numbers on many of the dice. I rarely have vision problems with boardgames, but even this one got me. 

Still, despite these production flaws, it's a pretty fun game if played quickly. Players taking forever to do their turn burns me out quick though. There's not much to think about in this game. 

Update: After a third play, my conclusion is the game is decent, but not something that I will ever desire to own or request again.

Picked this up after we played Dominion and read some reviews on BGG that this used 'deck building' but with dice.

Quarriors is a fun and short game utilizing a lot of dice. It plays like a deck building game, except instead of cards you manage dice. The only downside to the game is that I think it ends too soon. By the time you have a decent set of dice in your pouch the game is already in its last stages. This often means it comes down to lucky dice draws.

Entenc tots els comentaris i crítiques del joc. I entenc la proposta dels propis dissenyadors de que cadascú alteri el joc amb les seves home-rules.
Quarriors és una idea boníssima que van perfilar i perfeccionar molt amb el Dice Masters, però que al Quarriors li falten coses per polir. 
Com a resum: les partides són massa llargues pel nivell de frustració que "pots" acumular. A banda, algunes cartes tenen molt de text, que pots passar per alt...
 
És aviat per pronunciar-me, però potser faltaria algun mecanisme per forçar el canvi d'una cara. Això és degut a que pots comprar tropocentes criatures i que quan les tires no et surtin les seves cares. Si no et surt la cara de criatura, no pots puntuar ni "repartir" --> Frustració.

La advanced culling rule evita l'efecte bola de neu (runnaway leader) i s'agraeix la seva presència. Potser caldria incloure, a més, algun altre mecanisme de catch-up. P.ex. explicat aquí: https://boardgamegeek.com/article/21964525#21964525

Una "variant" sobre la advanced culling rule és que a la fase 1 (score), pots decidir NO puntuar un dau. Si no el puntues, va a Used i pots destruir (cull) un altre dau de la Used pile.

La advanced buying rule (2 compres enlloc d'1) és una molt bona implementació ja que ofereix una alternativa en l'estratègia de compra (un bitxo gros? o dos més petits?), però per contra fa que algun bitxo que donava 1 compra extra ara no sigui tant interessant. Es podria substituir aquesta compra extra d'aquests bitxos per +1 Buy/+1 Quiddity.

Se m'ocurreixen mil idees. Però no cal oblidar que és i ha de seguir sent un filler ràpid. 
1) Al DM quan tires els daus tens 1 re-roll de tots els daus que vulguis. Es podria aplicar, però ja ralentitzarà més. Hi ha qui aplica: "gasta 1 dau qualsevol (spent) per fer un re-roll dels daus que vulguis" (podent-se fer tants cops com vulguis mentre et quedin daus).
2) Lo important és poder treure algun bitxo en un determinat moment (per puntuar i per repartir estopa als altres). Per tant, lo de "provocar" un canvi de cara d'un dau de criatura és algo a estudiar (veure historial partides on hi ha comentaris):
2.1) Hi ha la variant Quarks: gasta 6 Quarks per forçar una cara (d'un dau en active pool). Quan has comprat 1 criatura, els Quiddity sobrants els converteixes en Quarks. Es necessiten fitxes (o un D20 per jugador). Per canviar la cara, cal haver anat "guardant" quarks.
2.2) I una meva: gasta 3 daus qualsevol (spent) per forçar la cara d'un dau en l'active pool. --> Es pot forçar en qualsevol torn.
PROBLEMA: pot haver-hi daus xungos, que al sortir ho petin. P.ex., hi ha un Spell que dóna 3 de Gloria. Si et dediques a "forçar-lo" a cada torn que et surt, pot destrossar la partida, amb lo que la meva alternativa (2.2) potser no és massa adequada.

Traded extra copy for Conflict of Heroes:Storm of Steel.  2nd copy given as going away gift to Eli.

So I don't mind this game face-to-face and rate it a 6 overall.  A little too much work and dice moving for my taste.  However I quite like the iOS app where it does everything for you, which I rate an 8, so my rating of a 6.5 overall as this site is mostly for board games.  I wouldn't suggest the board game version, but do recommend the app.

A fast playing deck/dice builder which actually looks very nice. At first glance there seems to be no reason for using dice (apart from looks) given there is already variability in dice draws. Then it becomes clear when you play. There's the visceral feel to throwing dice as well as the fun and despair of good or bad rolls. It's a dice game. Be prepared!  Has slightly more interactivity as opponent's creatures can be killed, but more importantly plays quickly and doesnt outstay it's dicefest fun.

RATING: 7
Roll cool looking dice that are relatively easy to read and interpret.  I liked how different cards could be assigned to the same dice set for variability.  Powers kinda interesting.  As downsides, there are practically no meaningful decisions until perhaps your last roll of the game.  Also, a little long for as light as it is.  Still, I had a pleasant time and the dice were neat.  Wouldn't mind playing again or trying some of the variants.  UPDATE.  Still enjoy Quarriors.  Last time played with 3 this time with 4 and I think there is a scaling problem.  With more players, you suffer more attacks and late game only the highest defense monsters survive.  Thus the game locked up until someone got lucky enough to roll their high defense monsters.  Felt wrong.

Deck building with dice. That concept alone is pretty cool and the game is fun. Balance is an issue in this game and the rules had some glaring holes that did end up getting fixed in Quarmegeddon. The main problem in the game are the fact dice go into the discard after using them which allows the same die to be used multiple times in the same turn if the player can combo. The other problem is there is almost no reason to buy cheap creatures ever however a variant in Quarmegeddon solves this problem.

I was excited enough about this game to buy all the expansions after playing my friend's copy once, but upon further plays, it has become frustrating, particularly due to the randomness of dice draw and then further randomness of rolling the dice. The base rules of the game suffer from the runaway leader problem, but the "advanced" rules take away the "dicebuilding" aspect of the game, removing the possibility for interesting synergies. I'm disappointed.

It's a fine idea, and when I heard about it I was really keen to try.  But in reality it doesn't work for me.  I hate dice, and they hate me.  We have this understanding.  So when you compound the worst parts of deck building - needing to get lucky to have your cards come up in the right combinations you intend - with dice rolling you get the worst of both worlds.  At least for me.

Quarriors takes the super-trendy deck-building mechanic and replaces the cards with dice. While in theory this could be an interesting sort of game, and I can appreciate the design on a general level, it is essentially just a reimplementation of the general “Lets Make a Game! About Dice!” idea that generally fails to work for me. 

Really though, this is probably just another game that was not designed for me. I am not a fan of fillers in general, and dice games in particular. The main reason I ended up trying it out was it was new, short, and hot enough that it seemed like it was worth trying a few times. It ultimately was, but I saw enough in those three games that I know this game is not for me.

RATING: 5
Players are Quarriors, warriors fighting for something beginning with "Q" ... couldn't get into the back story!  A fairly simple deck building game where players draw six dice from their bag and roll them.  The results are applied - you may roll Quiddity (money), which can be spent on a new die, and/or on generating creatures that sit in front of you and try to beat up your opponents creatures.  Any creature still in front of you on a future turn allows you to gain glory and cull useless dice from your collection.  First to a set Glory threshold wins.  Nothing outstanding here, certainly light, a lot of luck, but it's fast and fun in a way with the quirky die rolling mechanic.

Played this twice the other day. First of all, I love the card design and dice, and there's something about a cube box that holds a bunch of cubes that makes me happy. The gameplay itself seems decent, though in our 4 player games it seemed to end so fast that I never felt like any of our strategies were ramping up. And dragons are overpowered. And I'm not bitter :P

Anyways, want to play again. The dice have to roll in my favor eventually, right? Right?

RATING: 6.75
I like this game.  I do not love this game.  The art is fun and all of the abilities connected to the various cards definitely add to the replay value.  Unfortunately, without any way to mitigate your dice rolls this game can really be feast or famine, where one player just runs away with it from the beginning.  If this were just a bit shorter, I don't think that would be such a big deal.  As it is, a couple good rounds or a couple bad rounds can really suck the fun out of this one.

Interesting take on deck building games, but with some twists that are either cool or annoying. Games can be quite the blowout (my first game ended with one player with 15 points while i wasn't even on the board) mostly because of the double random nature of the game: you draw your dices from a bag and then roll them, which can mean that not only you might not get the needed die when you need it, but you might not even be able to roll a creature, which are needed to score points. You also need to roll the correct amount of points to put the creature into play. Mindless fun, but with loads of luck.

Roll dice, beat up everyone's creatures, buy a die. Wait. Wait. Wait. Roll dice, beat up everyone's creatures, buy a die. Wait. Wait. Wait.

Quarriors (what a name...) is a pale pale shadow of Dominion. It features dice and fighting so it's somehow "better, funner, cooler" for the typical gamer.
 
There's a lot of important things missing here. Real decisions are really scarce. You spend the game reacting to dice and rarely taking any initiative. A great example of "The Game Plays You" in action.

Combos occur very infrequently, since the die must come up at the right time and also then roll it on the right face. Unlike a card, you can't count a result by "waiting for the card" to come up. You can "stack the deck" all you want and buy lots of a given die, but who is to say it will roll as you wish?

Also I don't see the satisfaction in victory. So... I rolled great a few times! Where's the consequence? 

Not only is a session not memorable, it's not engrossing in tactical thinking like Dominion or Lost Cities. Even a light auction game like Ra or For Sale has delicious tension. Very blah. 

Overall a fad that should pass by autumn.

It's just fun, and becomes just strategic enough with the Expert Culling Variant (with the house rules that triggering all "Scoring" abilities whether or not you cull for points if the creature survives, and allowing the culling of a different used die if you chose not the cull the creature).

UPDATE May 2015: After getting the iPad app, I've recently played this a lot more than I ever did with the physical game, and I'm starting to wonder how much of my affection for the game is based on physically handling those dice. The game design itself is maybe not so interesting to me, and I find it troublesome to have to continually reference the cards to know what each die does. I do love. The bag full of dice idea in theory, but I don't so much enjoy the flow of the game.

I think that Puzzle Strike is a more strategic and less fiddly version of this deck building battle concept.

This game had a lot going for it and I look forward to exploring it more.

Does not capture that Dungeon crawl experience that I get with Thunderstone...maybe the next play will change my mind.

My son and I used to play this game a lot. The mechanics are simple enough that he could play at 6 years old. The strategy is somewhat limiting, since basically you are trying to purchase the most expensive monster. The game changes a lot when you play more than 2 players, though, and is much better with 4 players.

I never really liked the expansions. I liked having new monsters and dice, but the added mechanics seemed gimmicky and unnecessary. I quickly stopped purchasing expansions once we had a lot of options for creatures and spells.

Good times chucking dice.  Very simple and luck-heavy dice building game.... but really just more of a dice rolling game.   It may very well be broken too, since it is possible to gain the highest and most powerful creature on the very first roll.   Probably could use some refinement, but then again, it's really just about buying cool dice and rolling them.   Has an addictive quality.   Room for as much house-ruling and custom set-ups as you wish.  (The point tracker is pretty pathetic.)

My biggest beef with the game is also an asset in a way. The game plays itself to some degree. There isn't much in the way of choices to make...You buy the most expensive thing out there; You have to attack every turn; You have to score your creatures at the start of your turn. Now, once new players catch on they either roll with it and have fun not worrying about the choices the are (or more specifically aren't) making. Or it kills the game for them. With each new expansion and with optional variant rules that does change a bit, but more rules makes it harder to teach and more choices makes the game drag and it is one that shouldn't drag.

Quarriors had a strange arc with me. When I first picked it up, I was largely dissatisfied with how the game played out - the dice mechanic seemed interesting, but rounds were dull and repetitive.

Then Dice Masters came out and I was like "Oh, so this is how the game is supposed to be designed." I picked up a few sets, which I thoroughly enjoyed.

Maybe after having enjoyed Dice Masters, I could find some joy in Quarriors. I'll never know now, as I simply cannot find the wherewithal to break it out again.

Really underwhelmed with this one, and maybe takes the top spot for Most Disappointing game in my collection. I don't enjoy managing the dice in these imaginary zones in front of me (spent, active, used, whatever, etc). The theme is annoying and totally detached from the game play, imo. The dice are also much smaller than I imagined, and difficult to read in some cases. The "combat" aspect of it is boring also.

mildly amusing game - however not sure of the depth of play as the player choice appear to be pretty obvious... higher casting cost dice are better then lower and few opportunities exist to put combinations together.

that said play is quick and mostly harmless. likely good for pre-teen kids.

not a purchase for me - but would play again.

update - have purchased .... rate a 7 as a 2er and a 5 as a 4 player... the chaos/random gap is larger going from 2er to 3er then from 3er to 4er.... hence 3er and 4er play/feel about the same except 4er is slightly more chaotic and random.

Quarriors is an excellent deck-building type dice game, where your "deck" consists of a dice pool that you draw from a bag.  Players roll their basic starting dice to gain "quiddity", the game's main commodity, and use that to purchase creature or spell dice to add to their pool.  Creatures are then used to attack the creatures of other players with spells providing augmenting effects.  Your creatures that survive to the next round are then scored.  

Quarriors is a fairly light game, and, of course being a dice game, comes with a high amount of luck.  Not only is there the luck of the draw from your dice pool, but also the luck of the roll to see what results you get.  That being said, I find Quarriors very fun for what it is.  It is also highly replayable as there are many versions of creatures and spells that offer different special abilities.  The game is also customizeable with many variants out there to make it a shorter/longer game with different options for culling.  There are several expansions that add even more creatures and spells to create more replayability.  Our group loves this game, and I highly recommend it.

Alright, this game has been on my mind most of the summer.  My husband heard about it on BGG and placed an order through our FLGS.  We were the only ones to order it and did manage to get our copy before they became next to impossible to get up here in Canada.  Over the past two weeks, I've played multiple matches with every possible group dynamic (2p,3p,4p).  Here's what I've discovered:

This game looks super cool for the most part and everyone who sees it is eager to try it.  The monster and spell cards are really neat and the corresponding dice are really snazzy.  I like that there are monster and spell 'classes', so you have tons of replay, as the dice can match up to a varied number of cards.  

However, the path to glory track (or the scorecard) is absolute junk.  The dice bags and player pieces are also incredibly low quality and some of the colors are difficult to distinguish.  So if you're playing 4p, it's next to impossible to tell which cube is blue and which cube is black.  

Now for the gameplay:  I found the game to be absolutely dull 2p, kind of blah on 3p, and the most fun, but still not great with 4p.  The issue isn't the game is too short (which I've read many people mention).  The problem instead is what it sells itself as: a dice building game.  This is no such thing.  None of the dice 'work' together or create any sort of satisfying combo like a deck in Dominion or Thunderstone.  You are simply buying dice that you hope will posssibly be drawn together but you have no guarantee that when you do play the dice you will get the outcome you desire.  

So we've found, it's easiest to win the game by focusing on whatever dice is available that scores the most glory and costs the least amount of quiddity to purchace.  Ignore any spells, purchase 2 or so of those dice, hope they roll on the proper side and you win every time.  People that attempt to play the game like a 'deck building' game and get an engine going just get super frustrated that the game is over before they get a chance to roll their defense spell dice with their super powerful attacker.

This game is just a gimmick and once the novelty wears off, there is nothing left.  Save yourself the money and pass.

I love dice. I love deck building games. I suppose I do not like dice building games. This plays well as a casual game with absolutely no strategy involved, but falls flat otherwise. It's a blast to roll your dice and pray they survive the round, but once the dragons arrive, it's tough breaks for everyone else. Fun for awhile, but grows old fast. Also, I understand producing this many dice is tough, but many of them were missing numbers that are essential for play.

30-45m, 2-4 players. 5+ plays.

Unfortunately, there's very little decision making involved with this game.  I guess it could be used as a gateway to the deck building genre, but base Dominion is already pretty easy and more enjoyable than this.  All I can say is that I'm extremely disappointed by this game and am glad I didn't purchase it.

Holy over-hyped awful. This isn't fun for anyone. How is this fun? I get that it's supposed to be light. I'm not elitist. I love games with dice. Die Burgen von Burgund. Stone Age. Any "war game" or "trash game". This is game is pure smoke and mirrors. Where do I have to make one meaningful choice at all in the game? It's a toy, not a game.

After giving it another try it appears to be even worse then my first impression, lowered rating to 1 from 4.

After talking to about 20 people this weekend, the best comment I got from anyone is 'I would like to like the game', and ' I think there is a good game there, it just isn't in the rulebook'.

Basically the worst of the deck building types of games.  It has taken everything that is wrong with Dominion and doubled down on it.  The basic problem is the game is way to short to really feel like you have accomplished much, or the dice you buy really matter.  It should be good for people who are generally clueless as to what a good game is.

RATING: 5
Seemed a bit random and lots of downtime with four players waiting for players to read cards and make purchases.  The small text on the cards and dice didn't help things.  The primary issue I had with the game was the way points were accumulated.  Dice are left in front of players and if they survive until the next turn comes around, you get VP's.  Ultimately, I found this core element uncompelling.  I haven't enjoyed any deck building games so far so take this rating with a grain of salt.

Quarriors probably deserves a higher rating, but the German translation is just SO AWFULL and HAZARDOUS that the game itself suffers!

Nevertheless the components are of overall good quality (just ignore the little colour-flaws here and there)

- high replayability
- nice dice
- easy and fast to learn
-> simply don't buy the German translation ;)

If this was made by Rio Grande, this would have been called Domion Dice. Do I really need to say more about the gameplay? In Dominion there's really two luck points: drawing your good cards, and drawing the synergies you were hoping to build. On top of that, you have now added the luck of the draw. I thought the game may have eneded a little too fast. The fact that the best creatures score the most points is a little confusing to me. Why not have the wimps score a lot of points and the brutes score just a few points? Part of me thought the game should have been a little longer, but the other half says "dice games should be short." It seems that the first person to score a monster is going to win the game. At least with the 12 points required in a four player game. 

Ultimately your enjoyment and preference of this game is going to be based on your outlook. If you're looking for the strategy of Dominion, you are most likely going to be underwhelmed. If you are looking for a quirky dice game, you are in the right place. 

7->8 I've made peace with the chaotic luck. You have to accept the best strategy is not a promise to win, you have to have a good (or the best) strategy and hope the dice go your way.

I don't know how I feel about Quarriors.  I love the idea of a dice building game, but I don't really like the combat. I love the components (SO MANY DICE) but the fact that they are dice brings a lot of limiting factors into the game.  For one, you have to constantly reference the card to see which version you are playing with. For two, the cost of custom dice molds really limit the amount of options you are given and the amount that can be introduced in later expansions. Also, you have to have a high tolerance for randomness to really enjoy the game.  Not a bad game, but not in my top list.

RATING: 6
The dice are really nice, but this game is a luck-fest.  Unlike Dominion, where you KNOW a card will eventually come up in the deck, here there's a good chance you'll buy some creatures, spells, etc., that you will NEVER see...especially if you play the game to the VPs as recommended.  I strongly encourage you to play to a higher VP count.  It's a fun filler, and a good game for introducing new gamers to (as they've got as good a chance at winning as everyone else), but there's not a lot of meat to it.

A deck-building game where each "card" has a variable effect based on a dice roll and victory points are scored by the number of played creature "cards" that survive from the end of one of your turns to the start of the next.

Fun, but certain cards are just plain bad. Other cards are overpowered (dragons). Could have been better - but there's no alternative... Luckily I've heard only good things about the expansions, so they might fix some of the problems.

Edit: There [i]is[/i] an alternative now - [thing=148575]Marvel Dice Masters[/thing]. However, while MDM is superior for 2 players, it will not be able to replace Quarriors. One because of the collectible aspect and two because it doesn't work with 3 players. With 4 players, you can play 2 vs 2, but I'd probably still enjoy Quarriors more.

I love this game.  It's a Dice building game (Think Dominion of Thunderstone, but with Dice instead of Cards).  Whenever I play this with people there are more strategies that I see people do, and varying levels of success with each strategy.

The weak points are that the Dragon and Wizard are undoubtedly the most powerful of creatures in the game, so you must get them if they're in play.  The other weak spot is that the deck being random as it is, you do run the chance of a lackluster match of cards, but this does not happen often despite having played the game so much.

RATING: 6.5
Rating based on 2 plays:

It's Dominion with dice instead of cards. Like most dice games, it's completely luck based, except for when you choose which dice to add to your bag which is only mostly luck based.

You know what though? I still find the game fun. It has a good amount of that built-in tension that comes with most dice games. The gorgeous components don't hurt much either.

What the game can really use is another way to cull dice, perhaps something similar to resting from Thunderstone.

Looking forward to any expansions, particularly those that would add new classes of dice in the mix.

UPDATE: After three plays, the most enjoyable game I had was without Dragons. Still needs improvement on the culling mechanism however. On further thought, you should be allowed to cull a die for its cost plus a premium.

UPDATE 3/4/14: Downgraded to 6.5. I still enjoy the game. And dice. So many custom dice. Allowing to purchase multiple dice on a turn improves things some as well. Haven't played tournament style yet (return scoring dice to the wilds). I'd love to see how that changes things.

I did like Quarriors as a decent idea, but never really played it, so it was one of the earliest games to leave my collection.
[b]previous comment:[/b]

The popular opinion on Board Game Geek is that Marvel Dice Masters is a better game than Quarriors.  I disagree.  Quarriors has an elegant system, with reasonably straightforward interactions between the cards.  It's a light, quick, silly fun game.

Marvel Dice Masters, on the other hand, has tons of ambiguities in the timing of the abilities, and is completely dominated gameplay-wise by a handful of cheap cards.  The meta-game is kinda lousy, because the game is so imbalanced.

As an idea of how much better I think Quarriors is, the only way I've found to enjoy MDM is to modify the rules to be more Quarriors-like - using a common pool from which both players purchase dice.

I am really enjoying quarriors at the moment as even with a finely tuned set of dice there are still so many possible results that each roll is very different.
 
That said there are some obviously powerful dice for example both the wizard,dragon and pale moon warriors that have a toughness of 8 are almost a guaranteed score as 8 damage is hard to achieve. The warrior that allows you to score it immediately if it kills something is also very powerful.

Played 6 times with 2&3 players for 3.25 hours.

I liked this more than I thought I would based on complaints I read on-line. Yes there is a lot of luck, but I felt like is was *not* obvious what to do every turn. There was scope for decisions on buying dice, culling dice, and even how to use the powers of the dice and which to keep to check the leader - again, decent amount of decisions for a light filler game. And the game looks fantastic.

So far 3 of my buddies are either lukewarm or cold to this game. This does not bode well. They didn't even get the initial novelty enjoyment that I did. I think the idea of the game is good, but the execution needs a bit of tweaking. After plays #5 and #6, I have to drop my rating to a 7. I want to like this game.

On the date, 7/20/11, I own and/or have played all of the deck building games available with the exception of one.  

The others have cards or pogs, this has dice.  I generally don't like dice games.  This is a little different because you are buying a specific die which you roll for the options on that die.  For instance, one of the various creature dice might have "buys" or "attacks" (both with varying strengths), and the roll of the die determines which action you get.

In all deck building games, an important strategy is to get rid of as much of your starting hand as possible because these are low-end starting cards that eventually bog down the hand.  A nice feature of this game is that when you score, you have the option of discarding dice, which often occurs as early as the second turn.

It is a quick game, 10-30 mins, so a good filler.  It comes in a compact metal box and will hold some sure-to-come expansions.

The important numbers on the dice are small and hard to read for those with poor sight.  Since I generally don't like dice games, and this is no exception, it doesn't score high with me.  Other players were also lukewarm, but one did like it.

Edit:  I have played 6 games, and in every game the person who went first, won.

Only a few games in, but had a lot of fun. Dice hate me, so this purchase raised eyebrows in my group, but it's more about the journey and the laughs than outright wins. I'd totally recommend this to fans of dice games, but if you don't like luck, steer clear (though I would assume that should be clear). There is the odd strategic decision to make, but a lot of your fate is trusted to the dice.

We suspect a problem with the culling mechanic that might need to be house-ruled, but for the most part it's a silly, fun dicefest. Impossible to like if you try to take it seriously (strategy takes a backseat to luck), but if you just kick back and let it happen, it can be quite fun.

Downgraded from 8 to 7 after a few more plays.

EDIT - I might have dropped this further, but the "advanced rules" really saved this one. Use them: when you would score, you can choose to cull or not. If you cull, you get the glory, if you don't, it just goes to your used pile and you get no glory. You now have 2 captures per turn instead of 1. Makes the game longer, but a lot better IMO.

This is my first true dice-centered game and so far I am enjoying the experience, though I have very few plays under my belt. The rating may go up or down in the next few months as I try it out with different groups of friends, but at this point I would not turn down a chance to give it a few rounds. 

My wife and I have played it together the most, and so far we have doubled the Glory Point goals just to have a longer experience. She has so far been underwhelmed by the endgame--you get your glory point goal and that's it, without any real feeling of accomplishment. Personally, given the randomness and luck factors, it's more of a pleasure to play as an aesthetic experience--colorful dice, colorful characters, fantasy element, and very light competition--there's not much you can really get aggressive about with other players. Still a fun experience for me, as I have enjoyed making the small decisions regarding capturing dice, summoning creatures, and comparing numbers. 

The only small caveat I have is that for how light the game is, it certainly seemed to take a while to grasp the mechanics. The cards are text-heavy, too, and each one throws a different element into reading the dice. Whether or not that's a drawback I suppose is up to individual players. For me, it adds to the social element of the game. Finding some play mats with the turn orders outlined has been a great help as well.

Despite it's many flaws, I like this game. There is something inherently fun to collecting dice and hoping they roll for you.

Már egy ideje kinéztem magamnak ezt a játékot. Általában kettesben játszunk, és vágytam valami könnyedebb játékra a sok komoly között, ami viszonylag gyors, és nem tekeredik meg az agyad a végére. Ígyhát megvásároltam a Quarriors-t!. :)
Maga a doboz elég kicsike, de gyönyörű a kivitelezése. Szép masszív fémdoboz, ami egy dobókockát formáz. A tartalom minőségére se lehet sok panasz. A kártyák extra vastagok és nagyon jó minőségüek, a rajzok szépek. A dobókockák színe, és formája nagyon jó, azonban a rajtuk lévő feliratok néhol nagyon aprók, és ezen felül néhol a festés se teljesen tökéletes. Emiatt nehezen olvashatók.
Néhol dobókockás dominionként emlegetik a játékot, de messze nem igényel annyi gondolkodást és kombinálást, mint a kártyás nagytestvére. Az egész inkább kicsit olyan munchkinos könnyed szorakozás, valamennyi agyalással vegyítve. Mi kicsit változtattunk a szabályokon, mert két játékossal 20 pontig nagyon hamar el lehet érni ezért általában 40-ig játszunk. Így jobban fel lehet építeni a paklit (vagy hogy hívják ezt kockák esetén? :)). Ezen felül plusz egy varázslatot szoktunk még betenni, mert a varázslatok növelik igazán a kombinációs lehetőségeket.
A játékot még csak kétjátékos üzemmódban próbáltuk ki, remélem hamarosan összehozunk egy nagyobb partit is. Állítólag négyesben már nagyon nehéz pontot szerezni benne.
Bátran ajánlom mindenkinek ezt a játékot, aki könnyed, gyors, kicsit agyalós játékra vágyik. Az ára kicsit húzós a dobozban található komponensekhez viszonyítva, de a tartozékok és a doboz minősége kiegyenlíti az eltérést. :)

The beauty in this game is the variety of different play setups. ive read alot of negative comments that say thigns like all you ahve to do iss buy the dragon or load up on knighs to win but i havent foun dany of that true. me and several of my friends have played more than 50 games and have seen personally several differnt winning scenarios. its a great game that pretty much everyone wants to play in my group and we usualy play 2 or 3 games back to back and then often talk abou tthe turning points and what happened. seriously LOTS of fun and i can only hope many expansions are to come -- currently being used as part of a trade negotiation

[i]August 2011, First Impressions:[/i] Excellent rules-light dice pool-building game. My eight year old son really liked the game and asked to play another game right after the first (which is uncommon).

There's a lot of hype surrounding this game, but time will tell if the game is enjoyable enough to hit the game table.

The rulebook was easy to read and understand. We rarely referred to the rulebook after the first game.

The components were pretty good. I've heard some people complained about the quality of the cards but I don't see this as an issue as the cards don't get shuffled or handled a lot. Some of the dice were hard to read but the cards proved to be an adequate reference.  It was difficult to tell the black scoring marker from the blue one. These are all minor nits.

A rating of "6" (+1 for kids).

RATING: 6
There's a runaway leader problem in this game.  The most important thing tends to be buy the super-expensive dice if ever you have the chance.  But the dragons and you'll win. The fix is to add a culling rule: you can only score glory (VP) for a die if you 'cull' it and put it back out on the board where someone else will have the chance to pick it up.  Otherwise you can continue to use it for its abilities, but not score from it.  This makes for a longer game but helps with the runaway leader problem. Of course, luck of purchasing high-valued dice aside, better players can make better decisions amongst what is left than a less experienced or thoughtful player.  I admit I played on my tablet for a while but my feelings about this game are pretty meh.

Me and my wife loved this game the first time we played it and we have played it a bunch since then. But then Dice Masters came out, and that has kind of replaced Quarriors for us, even though I still want to get back to it sometime.

Also own:
-Quarmageddon: This one mostly brings new cards and dice than anything else to the game.
-Quartifacts: In this expansion you can also choose to go questing with a chance to get powerful artifacts. Really cool addition to the game.

This was quite a bit better than I was thinking it was going to be. I was always on the fence about Quarriors when it came out, but I'm glad I finally got to try it. It is - just like most say - a deck-building game with dice. The rules are easy and the game flows. It is fun to build your army of dice and go through the motions. Still relies on a little too much luck for my supreme tastes (more than Dominion I believe) but for what it gives, it gives it really well.

Et deckbuilding-spil med terninger = En hurtigere og sjovere måde at spille deckbuilding-spil på! 

Mine erfaringer med spillet er endnu begrænsede, men min fornemmelse er, at ovenstående beskrivelse passer rigtig godt på [b]Quarriors![/b] Jeg har efterhånden prøvet rigtig mange forskellige deckbuilding-spil og det er efterhånden blevet en smule monotont. Den store undtagelse har indtil nu været [b]A Few Acres of Snow[/b], hvor der pludseligt dukkede et interessant spil med dybde, der anvendte deckbuilding-mekanikken. Og så dukker [b]Quarriors![/b] op som udskifter kortene med terningerne og dermed indfører den spænding som nogle elsker og andre snarere elsker at hade. Kombineret med masser af direkte interaktion mellem spillerne, er der tale om et spil, hvor man hele tiden sidder på stolekanten og hvor der aldrig er langt til højlydte udråb.

Light "deck building" game, much less decision making than in Dominion. Game can drag on quite a bit, at least with four players. Not very involving. Long set up for such a light game. I don't like that there are so few dice available in the wild, it seems like it punishes third and fourth player too much.

RATING: 5
Really enjoying this at the moment, but can tell that it will probably get a bit stale due to the lack of interesting choices during the buy phase. The double randomness of dice draw plus dice roll also could become a problem after a while, but so far has not been.

Edit: optional rules introduced in Quamageddon have helped with the problem of interesting choices in the buy phase. With expansions in play there is an issue of random card combinations often being such that some cards are often obviously inferior choices. For example, cards that play off of Corruption when there are no cards that can bring Corruption into play.

I LOVE this game. It has replaced Dominion for me. The game is easy to play and has less to keep track of, when it comes to combos unlike Dominion, where it can become very difficult to keep track of how many more cards you can play and such.

The dice look great, the powers are fun, the game plays quick and is easy to teach/learn and there's no constant shuffling of cards.

It's a great game, that I'd recommend to everyone, to at least try.

Owned 1st edition.  Sold it 2 years ago.  Rebought the 2nd edition after playing Marvel Dice Masters.  Really like it (and MDM as well).  Definitely want to get the expansion for variety.  We always play with the variant that you can buy two creatures from the wild, but not the variant that you have to cull the creatures you score.  I think it makes for a faster game that way.

Update: 7.26.14
Picked up expansion and the variety is nice.  This game is a solid 8, and I think I like it better than MDM because it's not as fiddly like having to figure out who is knocked out versus back to action pool, etc.  This just plays more streamlined.

Dominion with dice they cry.  And is a pretty good first description.  Several plays in, the extra randomness is going to take some getting used to, but as you start to get used to the cards - and don't have to keep trying to re-read the central cards - I think will improve.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Fun and short.  You make your major decisions when you eye the cards at the beginning of the game and decide what, say, 2-4 dice you're going to combo.  From there, as they say, the die is cast.  You can make some minor adjustments to respond to your opponents dice but overall you're mostly playing out those early decisions.  It's so short a game that I think it works.

Yellow dice are way too inexpensive, though, total no brainer.  It's not game breaking or anything but as far as I can see it should be pretty scripted into the game that the first players buy portals if they can afford them.

Our variant to improve the game is quite simple: allow each player to buy 2 quarry die base instead of 1, no 2 buys of the same die in a turn.  Also, eliminate the end game condition of running out of dice on 4 creatures or whatever.  It turns the game into a much better deck building game, speeds the game up a bit, and provides harder choices during the buy phase.  With this variant the game improves immensely, I strongly recommend trying.  I've only tried it with 2, though I don't know what would be stopping it from work with 3 or 4.

Update: Whaddya know, the original rule was 2 buys.  I still don't play with the alt culling rule yet but may do so eventually.  Own 3 expansions, the game is good filler and couples play.

Looks cute, and is fun to play a few times, until you realise there isn't really a game here. There are no real decisions to make. Roll your dice, play all the monsters you have, buy the best monster you can, repeat. Almost no strategy at all and the combat all happens on auto-pilot.

If you’re into deck building games and tired of dominion etc. this one is a good option. Even though there are people that dislike the addition of dice to the genre I really think it adds a lot to the game and gives it a unique feel.
With the additional (advanced) rule that allow you to buy 2 dice each turn and the (expert) rule that you have to cull the creature the turn you want to score it this game has now some meaningful decisions. Owning the Expansions adds a lot of variety to the game and makes it even better.

I can see why people might not like this, as there are two randomizers, dice and draw to prevent you from building the perfect engine, like in Dominion, but it is a fun lighthearted game as far as it goes.

It's like Dominion with dice. Dice bag building game instead of deck building. Not for dominion purists since it adds even more random then other dominion clones. For me, personally, I love it cause the random here adds a lot of fun without the shuffling. Still has plenty of skill.

RATING: 8
Played no iPad. Good game, I imagine how would be rolling these dice in physical board game, however regarding gameplay there are a couple of drawbacks. First, dice are pulled from bag and then rolled what makes result quite random and scoring-dice trashing mechanism could make run away leader problem. Second issue is that you almost always are buying one of most expensive creatures you can afford - no good reason to buy low cost dice. So like Dominion with dice instead of cards, but more random. However still decent game and quite entertaining.
I think, instead of re-roll icons, there should be default rule that you can re-roll any dice up to 2 times like in Yahtze. This would mitigate random - more rolls per game according to player choice means that random evens out without adding much to game length. And cheap creatures should provide something what expensive ones cannot, so that you should think, what to buy.

I enjoy playing Quarriors because of the fast pace and the visceral pleasure of drawing and throwing the colorful, attractive dice. And no shuffling! In terms of strategy, there is a tiny bit but not a lot. You might buy the perfect blend of creatures, but fail to roll the right faces on those dice. In Dominion, it's a question of [i]when[/i] your cards will come up. In Quarriors, it's a question of [i]if and when[/i] your monsters will appear.

The bottom line is that Quarriors is a silly game, and I'm okay with that. I feel like the game design could/should have been better, but that doesn't keep me from having fun with it. I suspect that my rating would fall precipitously if I overplayed this game.

There doesn't seem to be a combination of variants that saves this game for me. The dice are very, very cool. That is the advantage this has on Dominion. However, the trade-off is all of the decision making and strategy. I am not one to say that cool dice are worth it for a game with no decisions.

[thing=53953][/thing] with dice is a suitable description of the game. You roll dice, attack your opponents, buy some more dice and hopefully your dice will survive until the next turn so you can score. One common complaint has been that it is too random, but it is actually less so than [thing=53953][/thing] because you build your “deck” around what other players purchase. The thing about this game is that this is pure fun and it is short enough that I don’t bother about the length of the game.

After a little more than a dozen plays I think I am finished with the game – there are simply no surprises left in the game. It was a nice experience, but time to move on. Maybe an expansion will enliven the game.

The difference between deck-building and dice-building is that in deck-building you generally know what's going to happen when you draw the card. In dice-building, you have six sides with which to contend. This makes for a fairly frustrating game when someone wants to approach the game like Dominion. In Quarriors! you simply shrug and let the dice do their thing. My comment on Dominion is that an advanced player will undoubtedly defeat a newcomer with no way of balancing it. Quarriors! attempts to strike that balance, but it seems like it goes a bit too far in that while players have choices they are still just along for the ride. But the game is fun. I read somewhere that dice are popular for games because we like the tactile sensation and the minor use of motor skills...and it's true! And this is a great follow-up game for when people are frustrated by Dominion.

How many house rules and expansions did it take before this game had strategy in it? Caused me to actively distrust the publisher and designers.

Redeeming feature: The icon-filled dice with cards that change the meaning of the icons is a great way to create variable setup without having to print 60 different dice. Well done.

This is a fun little deck builder that I picked up before I realized I liked deck builders. I love dice, and this game has a LOAD of dice! Granted, the dice rolling aspect makes the game less strategic than it has the potential to be but if you take it for what it is (a light deck builder with some neat dice, fun art, and cool mechanics) you will have fun with it.

This is a very quick deck building game.  Like the deck builders, the choices seem to mostly be what to buy at least from my limited experience with them.  Occassionally you may also choose to reroll certain dice and whether to activate creatures or have more "quiddity" (resources) to buy with.

RATING: 6
Plays fast and fun, lots of dice rolling and all-out brawls. Some of the dice are hard to read at first glance, and players are always reading the small print on the cards to know what each of the 10 dice do. This slowed the game down a bit, picking up cards to read them and picking up dice to see if that's an 8 or a 3 that you rolled. It's a good, fun game, however, and will appeal to younger folk and to older or more experienced gamers looking for a filler game.

I need to play a few more games before I'll know how I feel about it. My first game I just bought the most expensive option every time.

Update: It's growing on me. Dominion with dice isn't an unfair comparison. I don't think that fiddling with the dice is any easier than shuffling cards, but I like using dice just for the change. I prefer the theme over Dominion. (I'm a sucker for fantasy themes.) I really want to buy it and I'm not sure why. The tin and the dice are just so nice to look at...

Update 2: Played in a tournament at TotalCon. I didn't roll monsters early on, and I lost badly. I'm coming to the conclusion that there just isn't much too this game. It's just meant to be a fun diversion. It really doesn't compare to Dominion in depth.

Awesome concept for a game, but I wonder about its long term appeal because of what seem to be balance and luck issues.  Never had trouble getting anyone to try it, but the game can be over very quickly (usually too quickly in my mind; I feel the same way about Nightfall).  Easy to learn and play.  Still enjoying it, but feel it could have been much more.  Look for someone to improve on the concept by learning from Quarriors mistakes.

A dice based 'deckbuilding' game, in which players purchase dice to add to their pool. Q plays similarly to other games like Dominion, except that every hand you have to roll the dice you've drawn for that turn, so you never know quite how well your spells/creatures will perform on any given turn.

An interesting twist on the usual deckbuilding idea, but it adds another element of luck which may not suit everyone. I also found it a little confusing having some information on the dice and other information on the card, unlike the card games where everything you need is on the cards you have in your hand.

Preliminary rating of "6" after 2 plays of the 2 player game.  Very pretty, fancy components (dice, cards, box) and quite innovative idea (drafting dice instead of cards). Gameplay was a little bit disappointing (say: dull),  For instance, a single game seems to be too short to allow interesting tactics and scoring swings.  Need to try again with more players and perhaps with a higher VP goal.

It is increasingly clear to me that what I want out of a deck-builder is out of step with what most want; I do not enjoy Dominion or Ascension, but love Thunderstone and like Quarriors. This is despite their rather pointed lack of balance and their difference from each other. 
Allow me to enumerate Quarriors' faults; its aforementioned lack of balance, it can be over too fast, it can be too swingy (dice game, after all), lack of good cost spreads (not enough expensive cards), lack of many meaningful choices on a turn (not as bad as Dominion, but not as good as Thunderstone)...
But I don't care. Chucking colorful, attractive dice is fun, and while it can be too fast Quarriors rarely wears out its welcome.

RATING: 6
Very similar to dominion with a lot of the same flaws, but several distinct advantages as well.  One issue is that it mostly plays itself once you know what you are doing.  There isn't much game there.  Most turns your actions are entirely dictated by your roll and for many creature/spell setups, every number of quiddity will just have you buy the most expensive creature (with a few obvious exceptions).  Not enough choices and easily optimized turns makes it feel a little like yahtzee.  Not that it is bad, the dice rolling is a lot better than the endless shuffling of dominion.  I do think it is fun and very quick.  The price point is understandable given the components which are excellent but I have trouble paying fifty bucks for a 30 minute game with little replayability.

It is a game i like and will play when others suggest it but not a game I am going to shell out the cash for.

Quarriors! is an excellent game that just missed my top 5 from this year. Dominion started a new genre of board game a few years back: deckbuilding. Quarriors! takes that concept and does it with dice instead of cards.

However, the differences it has from Dominion seem to be the things that sharply divide people. For example, Dominion is all about efficiency. You need to build an "engine" of cards that all support each other, get rid of the stuff in your deck that doesn't support it, and do so faster than anyone else. Quarriors!, by contrast, has less opportunity for getting rid of bad dice (and there are more bad dice to get rid of) and it is also much more about attacking other people. You are much more likely in this game to base your decisions around what other people are doing rather than trying to do the same thing better.

There are a few drawbacks, yes. I don't like the tin it comes in, the scoring track weaves around so that it is very easy to move to the wrong score if you aren't paying attention, and I wish it could support another player or two.

Even so, I see an incredible depth to the game, not to mention the sheer tactile fun of rolling all those dice. I think this game just gets better with more plays. You can do a successful swarm strategy, buying lots of guys that boost attack and defense of other units. You can go for a fast build-up of quiddity (the money you buy things with) to buy that huge dragon as soon as possible or even the die that scores you points directly. How many spells should you add? They are super-powerful, but creatures are so important both for culling (getting rid of dice) and attacking other players. I've seen builds with almost nothing but quick-scoring death dealers, I've seen builds with tons of tiny guys and portals to draw a ton of dice, I've seen builds with Witching Hags that keep recurring other Witching Hags and just won't die. This game has all the paths to victory, combos, and variety of Dominion (in its initial 25-card set) without all the boring min/maxing.

But, is it actually better than Dominion? I don't think so. It's just as fun, but there are times when it seems like a good roll or two early can decide the whole game. They are different enough to want to own both, but if I could only have one, I'd take... Rune Age.

I like the concept, but the in game execution is iffy as you are rolling dice after all...

Attacking everyone simultaneously takes care of the bash the leader issue the game could have, but at the same time prevents weaker players from catching up.

I've seen 3-player games were we'd like to stop the leader, but roll nothing useful to attack with, and the game ends with scores of 2-2-15, which gives the impression there is a runaway leader issue.

After several additional plays, I have increased my rating to 5.5, but the runaway leader issue is flagrant, especially when someone gets one of the more expensive die at the start (such as the dragon).

Would like to try one or two of the expansions to see if it resolves any of the above issues, else I don't see the rating going any higher.

My first impression of Quarriors was pretty harsh, but it has definitely grown on me. I was annoyed at the luck of the dice piled on top of the luck of the draw, and concerned with the balance, or lack thereof. But to focus on those issues is to lose sight of the game's many charms. Deck building is fun, multicolored dice piles are fun, monster battles are fun. It's short, easy to understand, and quick moving. It's over before you could possibly get tired of it.

Yeah, it's lucky, and maybe the balance isn't quite right (still haven't decided on that one for sure), but it's clever, engaging, and fun. Quarriors offers something different, and it has earned a niche in my collection.

There are parts of this game I thought I would like a lot.  I figured the dice aspect would be maybe a more "fun" version of Dominion, something light-hearted and easy to learn.  What I found was pretty much nothing but bad game here though, riding on hype.

To start with what I ended up liking by the end of the game, the artwork and different dice are nifty.  That's pretty much about it.

Ripping off Dominion almost to a T, a random seed of cards is placed out on the board.  Unlike Dominion, where cards are typically pretty easy to understand, there are strange iconography to learn on each card, and different effects that you have to learn as you go along.  Similarly to Ascension (which I also disliked), you are at a strong disadvantage playing your first time.  Unless you're going to study the cards for minutes, it's difficult to formulate a strategy.  Compare to Dominion where many cards are pretty simple, and those that aren't are easily understood by taking a few seconds to read it over.

Leading on to the notion of strategy though, is the extreme randomness.  The dice bag is similar to the draw deck of Dominion, and that's an interesting mechanic.  However, the dice being random means there really is just an illusion of strategy.  One of our players who isn't necessarily a "strategic thinker" picked dice by how pretty they looked rather than reading what they did.  The player sitting next to her just explained what her options were when she rolled her new dice.  Yet, she was one turn from winning.  This isn't evidence per-se, but it does point to what I feel - the dice can only be fair over the long-term.  Considering how short this game is (why you only play to 12 in a four player game, I don't know - more on this later), a hot streak of a couple turns can pretty much decide the game.

If you do take the time to read the cards and their effects, you might at least try to follow a plan.  But since you can only buy one die per turn, if you don't manage to roll a good side of the die when it comes up, your purchase is useless.  In Dominion, it may be random as to when you get your card, but when you get your card, you at least get the choice to use it!  Here though, all you want are creatures with high defense, like the Wizard.  The wizard dominated our game - no attacks (other than the extraordinarily expensive Dragon) were able to kill a wizard.  This was guaranteed scoring if you rolled the creature side of the die.  In Dominion, I've not yet seen a card other than perhaps the Chapel that will trump the entire set of cards.

Even if you get a great set of dice though, by the time  you're actually seeing it payoff, the game ends.  Twelve points is very short, and there is very little more than engine building.  This was a blessing for me, as I had no chance of winning after not choosing a Wizard (my mistake for not sitting to evaluate every card, and also for not rolling 7 money soon enough).  The game ended quickly, but felt ultimately pointless.  It's not light enough to feel fun like Killer Bunnies with the randomness that game has. The combat is there to piss each other off, and the game isn't deep enough to appeal to me either.

I would rather play just about any other dice game, and if Dominion was available, I would never, ever choose Quarriors over Dominion.  A shallow, over-hyped ripoff at best.

This boring game is really just a gimmicky twist on standard deck-builders, and aside from its dice -- which is poorly manufactured, and suffers from some odd colour choices.

There aren't many strategic choices, and there aren't many ways to mitigate the luck, and -- depending on how the cards come out at the beginning -- you may find the start to be excruciatingly slow. Oh, and the end often just happens, prompting even the winner's confusion. That end doesn't come quickly, either... Quarriors absolutely overstays its welcome.


Finally, the rulebook is awful.

I played 4 games at Dollar Con and Quarriors simply did not do it for me. I may be stuck playing it anyway as my two boys (15 and 8) liked it and may put Quarriors on their Christmas wish list.

Edit: I played "Marvel Dice Masters: Uncanny X-Men" last weekend and liked that one much better (6.5) and its theme will likely please my stepson.

Dominion without the cards, but without the extensive playtesting and development either. There's a very good idea here, but the limit of 5 copies of most dice means that you cannot specialise enough for really competing strategies to develop. Instead you simply buy a few of each dice and then hope to score faster than your opponents. Perhaps expansions will fulfill the initial promise, but as it stands Dominion is comfortably better.

Very short and very light; in fact, it's so short that buying a die is a little chancy as you may not ever get to use it. Some of them are much stronger than others.  The idea of a dice building game is moderately clever, and the game will appeal to people who have short attention spans and love dice. Me, I'm not really in that demographic. I'll still end up playing it fairly often as it's so short that it's likely to come out when people have it. (5+ plays)

Deceptively simple, but there's a lot more to it than just dice chucking, so if you want to really get into it, take your time and read EVERYTHING (rules, monsters effects, spell, etc). You can learn playing it in minutes, but it takes way more to master it. A lot of the complaints probably come from ppl that either hate dice based games, or maybe they jump into it before properly digesting all available information. Yes, there will be times when a player will be able to score big and run with it, but more often than not, you can keep up the pace if you understand the best ways to pull out dice fast and how to constantly score. So you can play it at a very basic level, call it an "all luck dice chucking fest" and be done with it, or spend more time to learn all its tricks and then you may understand why people love this game so much. Very, very underrated gem!

The novelty of course has to be tried!

As published, it just didn't work for me.  Multiplayer in particular was absolutely no fun.  2-player is bearable.

With the following house rules it was more fun for us:

1. When rolling you may move 1 active die to your used pile to re-roll another active die.

2. You may cull a die when one of your creatures is killed in combat; not when you kill a creature in combat.

July12:

Even with the second expansion, this game just couldn't make it.  It was fun for a bit, but the horrible balance of abilities just ruined it.  I like my games with variety *and* balance.  It requires more playtesting, but that's okay with me.

Update - This game's rating has been sinking with repeat plays.  It has a lot of unfulfilled promise.  I don't think rules tweaks and variants are enough to fix it.

First thoughts - It does not have the depth of Dominion or Ascension, and there is an additional layer of luck due to the dice rolling (but what do you expect it is a dice game).  However, it is easy to teach and play and makes a very nice filler.

Best way to describe this game is ; 
Dominion with dice.
Great game, altho for fast setup you need a good system, same goes for Dominion. When playing with expansions you have tons of options,

Else fun guaranteed (and yes it's dice so frustration also)

The idea of a "dice-building" game sounds amazing! But then you start playing and begin to realise the randomness of rolling multitudes of dice will always overwhelm any potential for strategy.

Not only is your success based on your ability to effectively roll a handful of dice, but you're also hoping to randomly choose good combinations of dice from your bag. I can see exactly why others have called this  game 'randomness squared'! No matter what you do, the game will be won by the player who had the best dice rolls.

The game would probably benefit from being longer to help mitigate some luck and differentiate between players' different purchases. Also, it would help if there was some sort of alternate win condition so you can make more productive use of 'bad rolls'.

I can see myself playing this game from time to time if I'm in the mood for something super-light with dice and powers. Even then I'd probably rather play King of Tokyo...

(note, have only played 4 player)

I don't usually rate games after one play, but in Quarrior's case I'll make an exception. Knowing going in that the game was going to be light for my tastes, I wanted to like it regardless. The concept was novel and portions of it are well-executed. But, the player who won our game literally made no tough decisions. He rolled well enough that he bought dragons on his first two turns, and he spent the rest of the game using them to win. It was very unsatisfying, both for him, and for the rest of us.

I have no doubt that it's possible to have fun games of Quarriors, but if experiences like mine are also possible, then the game is unfortunately flawed.

Imagine playing Dominion without the guarantee that cards purchased will actually provide their described action when added to one's hand. That's the core problem of Quarriors. There is probably a better way to inject the luck of dice-rolling into the deck-building formula, but this is not it.

Was a pretty good (if random) game that became obsolete for me when I put a Marvel Dice Masters collection together. Dice Masters is only 2 players where this is up to 4, but Dice Masters is such a better game it made me not want to play this, even with 3 or 4.

I like 2 player plays but I do believe that there seems to be an issue with 4 player games. The downtime is huge and there is not really much control of what happens. Just buy Dragons or Wizards and skip the rest of the dice...

The dice add even more randomness to the deck-building concept because not only are they selected randomly, but their abilities each time you draw them change randomly.  Still, it was kind of fun.  I'm not sure all the dice are well balanced, but with only two plays under my belt as I type this, I don't have sufficient experience to judge fairly.  Update: after a couple more plays, the two degrees of randomness (what you draw + what you roll) is proving to be more of a concern than the dice balance.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A really lame Dominion like variant using dice instead of cards.  Even worse is that the numbers on the dice you need to see are really hard to read (by everyone I was playing with).  Expandability is also going to be an issue.

If you want to try a Dominion like variant that doesn't use cards try Puzzle Strike instead, there you are using round thick cardboard chits that you also put into a bag.  I didn't really care for it much either but it's more playable than Quarriors imho

Disturbingly, I like this less every time I play it. A game tends to be decided by a swingy late roll where you either just hit the perfect balance of quiddity/creatures or miss completely and just roll quiddity or dudes. Similarly, if someone just gets lucky and rolls a 8 or something early to get a dragon or wizards, they're almost certainly going to win.

A decent introduction to '* builder' games, with the dice rolling keeping things random and the randomized supply piles keep things fresh.

I've played it 10 or 12 times.  I'm not sure that it has the same kind of legs that Dominion has.  The cards feel too similar to each other and the spells are either worthless or auto-buys (like the Victory Incantation) with little wiggle room.

The mechanics are cool, so it could pick up with a well-designed expansion that experiments a bit more.

I like Quarriors! a lot. As long as you play with the two advanced rules (cull the dice that you score, buy two dice), the gameplay is very fun.

We really enjoy this game, especially when we are looking for something quick.  It sets up quick and you can play a full 2 player game in about 15 or 20 minutes.  However, a lot of times the game can be Too short such that you don't have time to really develop any kind of strategy.  (We increase the amount of "glory" points needed to win to try and fix that.)  Overall fun game and a good addition to our other "building" games.

Initial Rating: 7.0

At first glance this is a fine game, but there is something that bothers me about it. I love Dominion-like games and it is really nice that I don’t have to shuffle in Quarriors, however I don´t enjoy the game very much, it has more luck than I feel comfortable with for this kind of game, in Dominion you will always (almost always) have access to the powerful cards you have bought, in Quarriors you will draw the powerful creatures but you are never sure if you can trigger them or not. Almost no interesting decisions to make, either your roll was good or not.

At least it is fast, and that’s the only reason I will play it again, but it is also what bugs me the most, the game ending feels so abrupt I don´t like it at all, and like the game it is pure luck.

A game I will play again but not a game for me.

I played the game again and I won by a huge lead. However that just makes me like the game less. I won because I had very good luck, not because I carefully planned my moves. There is not anything interesting to do in my turn. This game is losing ground each time I play it. The new rating is 5.0

I will play it very sporadically because most of my game group likes it.

After more plays (thanks to the iPad) I like Quarriors less and less. You can cull as many dice as creatures earned glory this turn? This is just ridiculously  unbalanced, if you scored, it means you are getting ahead, and in reward they let you cull the trash from your “deck” making it much more likely to score again while your opponents draw the trash they still have.  I think an expansion changed the rule, but as this is from the base game, the rating needs to go down. This is an absurd rule.

Definitively, I won’t play Quarriors EVER again face to face, it is just an unbalanced luck fest. On the other hand, I think I can play it from time to time on the iPad as the game is much more quickly. The art and the dice are gorgeous, but this is the only thing the game has for it.

It's a decent light weight game, but there really is no strategy in it at all for me. I want to like this more than I do, and I do enjoy playing it as a filler, but I really feel like the rules need some fix. There is almost no catch up, no way to make your guys survive, and I've seen to many early leaders win out.

It's OK. Just that. 

Kevin Wilson suggested a fix for it that sounded like it may work. I wish to God, I could recall more than the first part of his tweak.

This may be saved by the next expansion, but for now, there's not much here and that makes me sad. I do have fun teaching people it, but it is not lighting me up...I like the dice though. I think that's cool...and the potential for 6 variations on a card.

Two plays only, but I'm liking this.

'Dominion-dice' seems a popular label, but I find this a lot more fun. Weed your deck, buy strong, hope the right dice come out at the right time - and roll lucky! There's more interaction, 'though - you attack the others and must anticipate them attacking you, and your tactical decisions are in part based on the others' scores and what dice they have in play.

Only gripe: playability would really have benefitted from the text being bigger on both the cards and the dice. 'What's the benefit of that spell again? I can't read the card from here'.

Overall, a lot of fun.

Rate this one slightly above average the only real decisions come from which dice to buy which is usually the most expensive you can afford.  After that there arn't many difficult choices to make.  After a few more plays generaally the person who can nab the more powerful monsters will run away with the game and this will unfortunately be down to luck of the draw/roll.  It would balance better if some of the more powerful monsters cost more to summon or gained negative glory at the start of your turn.  I want to like this game unfortunately despite a promising start it leaves a bit of a sour taste in my gaming gut.

Really feels like it needs a Quarriors Quest game where you can actually take your dice off on a quest.

RATING: 7.5
Nice light random game.  Randomness in this game is, in my opinion, a good thing because just because someone gets a potential powerful die doesn't mean that it's powerful effects will happen everytime it is drawn from the bag.  Love the replay value as well.  Not for the hardcore strategic gamer for the randomess of the dice reason.  But this is a light hearted game that lasts 20mins per session which makes it an awesome filler that will take awhile to wear out its welcome.

For a game that's main selling point is the dice you'd think they'd be better quality. Small with numerous printing defects, they take the shine from what could ultimately be a fairly fun game.

Oh, that and the fact that there seems to be very few decisions to make. Come on, where are the strategic combos?! Maybe expansions will save this game but I'm not holding out any hope...

I really wanted to like this game. I like deck building, I like dice. It just didn't click with me, though.

Update: I've played this a few more times and I definitely like it better than I thought I did (upped my rating from a 5 to a 6). I still wouldn't buy it, though, because I just don't think there's enough variety in the box. Even with an expansion added in, there's just not enough going on.

Certainly not a Dominion. More of a King of Tokyo. That taken, it's certainly a fun game! Why it's not higher: More plays, amount of luck... Okay I replayed this with the advanced rules (at the back of the book) and it's waaay better... so much so that I'm started to be tempted by the expansions. Note: Quartefacts is apparently the best expansion

RATING: 3
Simple little dice rolling game where you purchase dice to add to your bag. Once you have them then you just hope that when rolled they can be used for what you bought them for. 

Not a lot of decisions to make nor any real tension in the game make this something that I have no desire to play again.

The cards are pretty and the new edition of dice are easier to read but I'm not seeing the game part.

RATING: 9
Who doesn't love to throw a handful of dice? A strong luck factor exists for sure, but there is enough strategy in building one's hand that it keeps it thoughtful. We ignore the victory track's "stop" mechanism (depending on the amount of players) and simply play until the first person gets all the way to the end of the victory track. Otherwise, 2 and 3 player games would be too brief.

Truly Terrible! Why would you want a game with painfully obvious choices that either bear fruit or don't based upon (at least) two random factors?!

PROS: 

The dice are cool.

CONS: 

Choices are obvious.
Choices are meaningless, when compared to luck factor.
You don't truly feel like you've won or lost when the game is over.  It's complete milk-toast. 

What a worthless game.  You might as well just roll a die and choose your winner by highest roll.

I have gone from lukewarm on this game to a raging fan. Every time I play it, I like it more. This was, by far, the game of GenCon 2011 for me and it looked like I was far from alone. My initial impressions of limited replayability have been completely assuaged (even though my fears of a runaway leader problem have not). The variety that presents itself after a few plays is fantastic.

Some people compared this to Dominion with dice. I can see that, but cards have more space for artwork that adds to the feel of the game. Also the dice rolling adds a significant random element which I don't enjoy.

RATING: 6
The game is too complex for what it does. As a simple luck based dice game, I do not like the vast amount of text on the cards, and some creature cards can be very overwhelming. A game this light should be able to be presented to new players, including all cards read and understood by all players and played within 30 minutes, max.  

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Quick and fun. Definitely only for people who can deal with a good deal of randomness in their strategy games. Getting more plays than most games I've purchased!

All the text on the cards is not as daunting as it at first seems either.

RATING: 7
After playing this a half dozen times I can safely say I like this game and that it has a rightful place in my collection.  The game-play itself provides deeper and more satisfying choices than other deck building games I've player, however the scoring mechanism is left completely up to luck/chance; even more so than Thunderstone.  This dynamic creates and odd dichotomy that makes people either love or hate this game.  Where the game truly shines is it's fast game play (quicker than Dominion ... usually and much  quicker than Thunderstone), the novelty of dice-building, and it's simple rules.  In short, this game is easier to get to the table than a lot of other games I own. 

I know my rating will go up from 7.5

Boreirrors get it? BORE erriors as in it's boring. Right? Anyone?

Super stupid game for dummies. Seriously, you make like two decisions the entire game! Yeah rolling dice is fun, I agree but besides that this game is an empty shell of an idea.

I wonder what the age on the box says because I feel that a 2 year old would have a pretty good chance of winning.

It does get some points for neat and colorful custom dice but since I don't get distracted by colorful or shiny objects, I saw right through the bling to the lack of gameplay and decisions.

3/5. Quick, fun dice roller. Girlfriend loves it and it's great for non-gamers. Would easily go up if it just had a TOUCH more strategy. Always felt I wanted a little more control.

First Impression - interesting cross between deck building & dice.

A little disappointed that the stronger critters are worth more VP.  Might be more interesting if creatures with fewer HP were worth more points.  As it stands, feels a little 'rich-get-richer'.

Very interested in how expansions work.

RATING: 7
Not a deep strategy game at all - very dependent on the luck of the dice. And that's not a bad thing. Makes the perfect night cap for those game nights where you've finished the meatier part of the meal, but just aren't quite ready to part ways yet. Has a problem where a runaway leader is nearly impossible to stop; but considering that games take about 15 minutes to complete, that's not too much of an issue either. Fun game to just lose yourself in, enjoy the combos of your dice, and have a larf.

This might not be bad as a light 'fluff' game of dice rolling, but it strongly lacks a strategic aspect. There are few choices to be made, and even fewer meaningful ones. The double-randomness of drawing dice and then rolling them completely negates any strategic aspect of 'deck' building.

So much better than it is given credit for. They remade quarriors into dice masters which gets a lot of love for good reason. The biggest problem with the game was the horrible decision in the original rules to only allow one purchase per turn and not culling on scoring. If you don't play with the advanced rules, you aren't playing it right. Game would score a 5 with the basic rules and is why this has been held back by the community (reviewers like the dice tower, etc still really like it). Expansions add something to the mix, but the base set is a great family game. It is much easier to teach than you would expect. It really is a family game.

I like the idea of the game - all the different dice are cool and the mechanics of the game are interesting. The main drawback of the game is all the special text on the cards explaining the powers.

For beginners though, the reading at the beginning of the game sucks some of the fun out of the game.

Having played many deckbuilding games inspired by Dominion, I think I can say that this really is just dice dominion. There really isn't anything groundbreaking or special about this game unless you really really like weird dice.

My biggest problem with the game is that the card text is horrible to read (font and size) and you need to constantly refer to them in-game. This game could be done as a card game and would be a world better, making the dice aspect seem like just a gimmicky marketing ploy.

Essentially a deck builder except you get to chuck dice.  I have had a ton of fun playing this game, but admittedly some games can drag on if people are not rolling well or everyone is rolling well.  The dice are beautiful. I decided not to get my own copy until the Marvel version was released, now that I own the Marvel version I will probably never play this again. 

Now that I have Dice Masters I don't know when I'll play this again, I could see the rating falling.

Similar to deck building games, but instead of cards players use unique dice (representing fantasy warriors and monsters). The components are very nice and the game has a unique feel.

Very good dice building game. I still need to check it with more than two players. I played it only few times and I need to ensure if it's really good.

2014-02-16 - I played it yesterday with three players and it's better than with two! That can lead me to buy some expansions!

2014-04-02 - I think it deserves a 9. I purchased an expansion (Quartifacts) and it seems to make this game even better.

2014-05-04 I didn't change rating, but in some card sets game is not as good. It loses pace. But it is a thing with all deck builders, I think.

2014-05-17 - Back to strong 8.5 rating, because some sets of cards make the game less fun.

2014-09-03 - I changed the rating again. 8.5->7.5. Maybe it's about my lost of interest in deckbuilding?

2014-09-16 - OK. This is the most changed rating of one game in my profile. This game has to be played with so called advanced rules - you can buy two dice and if you score you have to cull the die you score and that is the only way you can cull dice. With basic rules you just purchase most expensive creatures and who will luckily roll a lot of Quiddity first, will probably win by buing Dragon or Wizard.

2015-10-15 - 8->7 - How about another change of rating of Quarriors? Well we don't play this one very often and not always want to, so 7 is more appropriate, I think. Still a good game.

The game is fun, premise is unique! I kind of don't like deck building games because of fiddling around with a lot of cards, the dice make it way easier on me. Dragons are overpowered. The spell die to make you gain free victory points are dumb and it's a house rule to take them out. We always go to 20 regardless of how many people are playing. Hope if I ever get the expansion dragons get nerfed a bit to allow options for other strategies.

I don't care for all the shuffling in deck builders so putting dice in a bag definitely seems better but card games are already stripping out the game board and other physical components such that theme can be impacted.  In a purely dice game even more is lost such that it just feels like I am going through the motions.  Completely unthematic just endless dice rolling.  Have to refer back to the cards to try to get that sense of theme or just understand what your dice do.  It just isn't for me.

This game will make a good gateway game and is good for introducing deck building concepts in a fun and exciting way.

Like Dominion, if the cards had a random effect each time you got into your hand.  In other words, if you think that Dominion has too much luck, then you *really* should not play Quarriors.

Also, "liquidity" or "quiddity" or whatever that magic energy stuff is called is a dumb name.  It amuses me that almost everyone I have played with calls it mana.

A nice combination bag-builder and dice-chucker. It offers enough random to draw casuals but the experts will know the dice array better to compete. Abilities hit the sweet spot of not overly complex for veteran gamers. Plays fast (a little too fast for some engine-building fans apparently), but seems about right to me.

very intrigue by the dice building, I thought that Quarriors will be the game to play.
But quarriors (at least without his expension) his very luck based and, if you take the more expensive dice all the time you got more chance to win than trying to find a good combination.

Not awful, but I wouldn't really call it great fun either.

Luck ultimately determines the winner, and there's little strategy beyond "buy the biggest monster dice first, get lucky enough to draw it, then get lucky enough for it to roll your way." There's no build up and no strategy building like with real deckbuilders. 

Luckily the game is short enough and casual enough to be entertaining over a beer, but it's not the "Uber-Strategic" experience the tin sells you, and for that, I rate it below average. A box has to deliver on its tagline, at the very least.

In Quarriors, each player plays as a Quarrior competing for Glory in the eyes of Quiana, the Empress of Quaridia. Each player starts with an identical set of 12 dice in their dice bag. At the start of the game, Creature and Spell dice (Quarry) are dealt at random to form "the Wilds" in the center of the table. As play progresses, players roll their dice to attempt to summon Creatures, cast Spells, and harness the magical power of Quiddity (the in-game resource) to capture Quarry from the Wilds to add to their repertoire and into their dice bag. Players draw and roll 6 dice a turn from their bag, making that controlling bag composition is key to victory.Quarriors is a fast-paced game where players must strategically balance their choices each turn. Do I use my Quiddity to summon Creatures in the hopes of scoring Glory or should I spend it all to capture more powerful Quarry from the Wilds? Players must outmaneuver their opponent's through strategic Spell use, the acquisition of powerful Quarry, and ultimately, by striking down opponent's Creature in combat. If your Creatures survive until your next turn, you will score Glory points and move closer to victory!

Played three times, 2p, 3p.  Way better than I expected.  I dislike dice, and I mistrust the deck-builder genera.  But I liked this game more than I would've thought, for some reason.  I can't explain it well, but I will say, it never seemed like a game hinged on one roll, since you were rolling so many dice at a time.  I think if the games lasted as long as Dominion, I would've liked it much less.

RATING: 4
The idea behind this game is very interesting, but the implementation is not that good. It's basically a deck building game with dice. Each dice is represented by a card to know the rules of the die. The cycling of the dice is exactly the same as a deck building game.

The only good idea I wound in this game is how targeting and scoring is done. You summon creatures that are going to attack all players at the same time, but on your next turn, you discard these monsters and get victory points for them. So you only temporarily build up your army.

The problem with this game is that there is almost no decision. You don't have a choice to re-roll dice like it is the case in dune express and to court the king. You also have the problem of double randomness since the dice are also draw randomly. So it ends in a pure random fest. I would suggest to add a bit more strategy that the players could select the dice they want to roll from their bags.

Second, I think the game ends really short. You have little time to build your deck (dice pool). Spells are also not that interesting to buy because you actually need creatures to be supported by spells. So spells alone are useless. But the worst is that you cannot split you buying power on 2 dice, like buy a weak creature and a spell, you can only buy 1 die at a time. So the progress is just really slow and the game ends before you know it.

This is essentially a dice-building game of the deck-building genre (think of it like "Dominion meets fantasy slugfest").  Instead of cards used to build decks, it is dice used to build "decks" (or pools of chance).  Players duel each other with the warriors and spells that they buy and roll.  A warrior die, half the time, rolled usually generates a ranked warrior type (maybe with special features), or the other half rolled, usually generates money.  Money is used to activate a warrior rolled or pooled to purchase another die.  Quick, light fun dice-generating game.

There is a lot of validity in the negative reviews and comments posted about this game.  However, I am having a blast playing this with my two children so it has been a good purchase for me.

Edit -- I have dropped my initial rating of an 8 down to a 6 as it just doesn't hit the table much anymore as there are better games out there. I guess the randomness keeps it from being as fun as it should be.

LIKES:

* I like rolling dice so I enjoyed that aspect.
* Easy to play right out of the box.

DISLIKES:

* I would have preferred more variability with the percentages or perhaps even used different types of dice.  Just imagine the fun and probability factors that could be added to the game with dice with more sides or even dice with less sides.  
* I'm not certain there is much planning in this one considering the game can be over very quickly.  See who gets the luckiest rolls.

I have played this game a few times, maybe fifteen or so games, two plays a sitting, and I love this game. At first I was disappointed by the sheer amount of dice and cards and various things to figure out but once that I over this game is fun. What makes Quarriors so interesting is the use of dice instead of cards and the use of community cards. Every person has the same availability as everyone else, it's just a matter of rolling the required amounts at the right time to get them. Far too many people call this "luck" but it really isn't. If I have the opportunity to grab a creature but opt not to it isn't luck when I don't get that creature. If I need more resources (quiddity) I can get a portal to try to get more, cull a dice to better my chances of drawing quiddity, re-roll creatures for their quiddity sides, or look for spells that offer a combination of those choices. Selection is important. Yes, i have rolled hands of pure quiddity when I should have rolled creatures, and I have rolled more creatures than I had quiddity. Perfect hands, not so perfect outcomes. That's just the game, isn't it? It is exhilarating when an opponent doesn't get their creatures, and it hurts when you don't get yours, but it all evens out. Over games the person with the best hand, strategy, and luck wins. Take chances, get creatures, try to beat their best creatures with killing spells. The best part about Quarriors is the cards. Every dice has three, sometimes four cards, all with VARIANTS of the same theme, so the game is always different, the choices different. This is a must-have game. I played with two, three, and four players, but three seems to be just about perfect. With two if you have a creature it will probably score, with three it might, with four it won't. My problem with the base game is that the highest cost creatures (dragons and wizards) usually win the game, and the dice get beat up, chipping the paint. Otherwise this game is perfect.

RATING: 6
Sure there's a lot of luck in the dice and quite a bit of downtime to start as you read what all the dice do, but the former is also true with a lot of newer deck builders and those also often have a lot of downtime reading as new cards come out in their fluctuating buy row. Also, newer deck builders often have a rich get richer syndrome, where in Quarriors you have to lose your dice when you score. Factor in the short playing time and decent amount of interaction and I found this quite enjoyable.

I also like this more than its supposed successor Dice Masters, as I didn't find Dice Masters' combat system to make thematic sense, and I prefer a new puzzle of which dice are optimal each game, rather than making the majority of my dicebuilding decisions beforehand and then going through the motions again in the actual game.

At its best it's really satisfying to collect colorful dice and build a strong strategy. At its worst, a winner is apparent in the first 15 minutes and it drags on for a miserably long time, or somebody with a solid dice bag gets completely screwed by their rolls *in addition to* their draw RNG. In general a solid purchase if you like colorful dice, or have players who like them. :)

The player mats not being included was surprising and annoying. The fan-made ones I found on BGG were easier to understand and more attractive than the mat in the rule book.

The rule book is also not very good. It is one of those where nothing makes sense until you have read and memorized every single statement and reorganized them all into a more logical order in your head. It completely fails to explain the basic overall concepts and "shape" of the game, so that there is no reference point from which to understand all the details it immediately whacks you with. You can also find yourself in slightly fuzzy situations that you have to read the rules closely to resolve (if at all). It is trivial to explain the rules to new players much more simply.

Most of the confusion results from the exact timings of when dice are moved between areas, when they can be used, or whether they can be saved for later, but no overall "rule" or chart is provided to help understand the timings clearly.

Diceominion.  Would you rather shuffle or roll dice?  Generally, I'd rather Roll Through the Ages or vie for King of Tokyo.

So far, this has not been a hit for me.  It's too short to dislike, but it feels like you have less ability to manage your luck than other dice games.  I'm hoping further play and maybe variants or expansions may improve my opinion.

Seems to play a little better with 2 than 4.  3 might be the best number to balance downtime versus opportunity for player interaction.

The advanced culling rules do help a bit.  So does the fact that this is one of my son's favorites.

Interesting dice game but being a dice game it carries the annoyances you find with such things. Basically it's Dominion except you don't shuffle you just pull things from a bag instead.

Fun, quick-playing complement to other deck-building games.  Lack of strategy puts it more in the Ascension than Dominion camp.  Need to play with the 1-die-max-culled-per-turn variant to prevent runaway victories.  Some balance questions, particularly for the dragon dice.  Regardless, easy to setup and play.  Main mechanic of dice rolling makes the game highly replayable for anyone interested in a high-luck rollfest.  Frequency of expansions will likely determine the staying power of the game.  Plays well with 2, although folks interested in a more chaotic and longer game want to play with 4.

My first foray into the deckbuilding genre, albeit in this hybrid form, and I LOVE dice as much as the next gamer.  This game definitely introduced me to a whole new, wonderful world of games, and I bought the expansion almost immediately.

Problem is, I've now played it so much that I've become bored of it, and would rather play my other games always.  I like introducing this to new players, since the idea of a pure dice game is cool, but for people new to this genre of gaming entirely, it's always better to teach them using the PA deckbuilding game anyways.

So, I don't regret all the fun I've had with it, but it's gone in a trade with Fluxx for RftG and expansion.

Based on two plays. A lot of luck involved, but that's simply the nature of the game.

Excellent Game! the best deckbuilder game i´ve played, it has a fast game flow and lots of fun (and many laughts about jokes about the situations). I recommend to take a try with this innovative game mecanic, is not a Dragon Dice or dice wars game is very based on Building your Dice Pool and administration. I was expecting Ameritrash but found a deep euro-style game with dices. Since I have no deckbuilding game i guess i would buy it.

Thought this was going to be good
Save your money
The dice are interesting but what's the point
They are small and the special things about them is only on one card so yo have to stop every player turn and read the special rules to see what your dice does
Lets get real
The dice are cool, very cool......and that's it 
Dominion like card games are good filler games. 
Stick with the cards

Quarriors is a fresh take on the typical deck-building formula. Using bags of dice instead of cards makes shuffling your "deck" much less of a hassle, and the characters and spells are very charming. The game is really exiting to play and there's a special drama to dice rolling that makes the game very tense, but my group has come to find that whoever is winning within the first 10 minutes ends up taking the whole game. I don't think we've had a single play-through where this wan't the case. Also, I have the version that comes in the tin. While is a very nice little collector's item, it's not very practical as a storage device. The cards won't fit in their slot once sleeved, and you're pretty much forced to use those teeny tiny awful zip-lock bags. You're better off coming up with your own storage solution.

RATING: 6.5
A fun filler game. You can usually play a game in half an hour or so. 

Early game decisions are important, but sometimes you just don't roll enough Quiddity to be able to make those decisions and you are screwed. 

It's so short though, no one really cares and everyone has fun rolling the dice.

Very good idea but in the end it is just luck. I wish that dice building element added anything to the game but it is not like that. Which means that you can just throw 6d6 and whoever has best result wins. Which is even more fun and shorter then Quarriors. And much, much cheaper.

Quarriors has the frenetic excitement of a dice battle game, with an added ‘deckbuilding’ twist: players customize their dice pools during the game using resources generated by their rolls.
Quarriors takes the best of deckbuilding games without the tedium of shuffling. Take a typical deckbuilding game, add the speed and fun of dice and in 60 minutes you’re on your second or third game trying unique strategies against your opponents.

It's fun,  but short on decision making. Loads of colorful dice and cool card art. Needs to be played with 3 or 4, I think. 2 player is lackluster.

EDIT: After more plays, I've raised the rating to 7. It's fun! Better with a few house rules (see the Quarriors! geek page for the designer's alternate rules.)
Definitely only play it with 3 or 4.

Now this was a pleasant surprise! I was wondering how Eric Lang, one of my favorite designers, could have gone and produced something as shallow and unbalanced as many critiques of Quarriors implied, but after a couple of rounds found that I needn’t have worried: this is not only a nice idea in expensive clothing - garish, also - but a fully functioning and funny game with quite a bit of strategy crammed into the 20-30 minutes a normal round should last. Do I buy creatures or spells? Do I aim for a steady increase of victory points or start with building up my quiddity reservoir in the hopes of catching up with big creatures later?

Of course, there is a healthy dose of luck involved, but if you are capable of being disappointed by unexpected randomness in a game that clearly involves random rolls you perform with a random set of dice, then I can’t help you. A less inane line of criticism is targeted at the very big creatures and the unfair advantages they give to a player who manages to capture one of them early in the game. These biggies, especially the dragon, are pretty impressive, but in the four or fives games I’ve played, they did not turn out to lead to guaranteed wins.

The only thing that kept me from instantly going out and buying this after my first few games is the attempted cheek-in-tongue tone of the rules and the cartoonish graphics. While this can be pulled of, especially if you’re Vlaada Chvátil, it can also come across as rather juvenile. Nevertheless, the sheer fun of Quarriors is probably enticing enough to make me buy this, garish graphics be damned.

It is sort of fun to roll the dice, but the decisions to be made afterwords aren't very interesting. The cards have nice art, but the rest of the components are sub-par (especially the dice which is the core of the game).

This is a fun game, and it brings out the inner kid in me: Dice! Glee! It's not to be taken too seriously, and in that mode it certainly doesn't outstay its welcome.

The dice look great (a bit hard to read, but I understand the cost/size tradeoff), and they're fun to roll. I like that the different versions of each creature are substantially, game-changing-ly different, not just cosmetically so. There's enough strategy to hold my interest, but not so much that I feel like I should play Dominion instead -- it fills its own niche.

As cool as the giant cube tin is, I fucking hate storing this thing.

Hard to rate still.  About 10 plays, I like and hate it.  Part of me wants to give it a 6 - tooooo random.  But that's silly, after all it is a dice game (DUH!)

Dominion is a 'better' deck-builder.  Quarriors has a very different feel - don't take it too seriously.  You roll crummy, oh well.  Play it again and see how it goes.  This is a 'light' game, one that is meant to be played with laughter and conversation.  This is not an optimization game like so many.

A bit love/hate with this one. I like it with the advanced rules, but it feels like the cards are a little wonky, with some being too expensive for what they score.

RATING: 7
Another game that could be stellar if not for the random factor. I jumped out to a fast lead in the first game, and I think I had a decent plan in how to win, but got stuck in points after other players got going. Game two and I was off and running in no time. I was able to weed out three of the crappy dice early on and later took out two more and thus the size of my dice pool was small enough I kept getting good stuff. I won running away. I don't mind some random factor or dice but at some point there becomes enough randomness that it over takes the game. It does here as well. Kind of frustrating because to a point I was really liking the game.

Rating Potential: 6-7. I can't imagine it going to an 8.

Wanted badly to like it but there's just nothing going on. The tiny, poorly rendered, hard to read dice don't bring out the scary monster theme. I mean, come on, a chess pawn icon for a monster?!

It's an interesting concept on the deck-building genre but there's just not much fun, even with hundreds of dice.

All the interesting mechanics of Dominion with all the wrong variants.  Many of the dice (cards) suffer from what seems to be a lack of balance and playtesting.  Also the dice nature of the game makes it very swingy.  Still worth playing but definitely not buying as it's not a cheap game either.

Played 2 2-player games, 2 3-player games, 1 4-player game

The game is very easy to teach especially if the players have had experience with Dominion or Magic: The Gathering.

I introduced it to a buyer for a local hobby store last night and he hadn't stocked it yet because he didn't see it selling.  After one play he is now going to stock it.

So far, I like the game.  It's plays fast, has tension, and it has a lot of fun/funny moments like when you pull exactly what you need from your bag but roll all the wrong combinations or when you are rooting for another player so he can stop someone else from winning.

That said, it also has it's downside.  It's dice so the randomness rules, but you are able to mitigate it by the dice pool you create.  As far as design is concerned, a few of the creatures are not balanced well and some of the spells can have effects that are useless depending on the cards you draw to play with.

This is not a hardcore strategy game.  Its for those who like a fun light-hearted game with friends that doesn't last all night.

When your son says he rates it up as high as Heroscape, then you need to give it at least an 8.  I also think it is a great game, but I think the dice could have been made much better.  Take half a point off for that as I am worried the durabilty of the game.  It is a roll and build game.
But we love it! Light strategy,and rolling heaps of dice, (well about 6 at a time), but awesome.  I hope WizKids does not get bored of it like Heroscape.

Don't expect cathartic endgames or mindblowing strategic combos from this one, but it's a decent excuse to blow money on a ton of dice and have fun with them for an hour, without feeling completely stupid for doing so. Quarriors won't change the way you look at dice games, but it's a solid distraction which keeps up its charm for a long time.

RATING: 5.5
The first game of Quarriors grabs you by the throat and beats you against all the facets of “enjoyment” until you bleed every possible good feeling you can have about a game.  But at some point it feels a bit empty, and when you step back you realize the game out of the box is a bit empty and overly simple.  Add a tweak, add an expansion and your back into the fun for a game or 2, but again that original fun is hard to maintain especially as more and more games are using the dicey version of deck building to great benefit.  In many ways it is like other notable “firsts” regarding mechanics.  We all know them, we all played, we all loved them for a while, and now we all just leave them on the shelf.

To a certain extent Dominion with dice where dice are bought instead of cards, except for that (1) the dice bought can be "scored" and are returned to the bank, and (2) active dice can cancel out the opponents' active dice. In all, Quarriors! address all Dominion's shortcomings: the more direct interaction reduces Dominion's MP-solitaire nature; using dice in a baf alleviates the tedium of Dominion's incessant shuffle-fest; and the lack of theme cohesion Dominion suffers is avoided by the very form of the game. Recommanded for fans of fast deck-building games.

RATING: 5
ARGH!  This game is the epitome of the difference between a great IDEA and a great GAME.  When I first heard about Quarriors, I thought it was brilliant: capitalize on the deck-building fad by building dice, rather than cards.  And the potential for an incredible game is hidden somewhere, but I certainly couldn't find it anywhere in this box.  I feel that in a good deck-building game, you start with a few meager resources and you begin by trying to acquire more with more frequency.  You get progressively stronger with each phase of the game, and you eventually transition from a resource engine to a victory point engine.  In Quarriors, that sequence doesn't exist.  The best dice are the best in every way: strength, defense, victory points, extra powers.  Their only downside is their cost, but you can purchase every die available at the very beginning of the game.  In fact, you can never gain more buying power than the dice you have in your opening hand!  I'm so disappointed with how great this game could have been versus how mediocre it turned out to be.  My rating is far more harsh than this game really deserves, but every time I play, I can't get over how much better I wish it was.

RATING: 5.5
Game in a Nutshell: "Deck-building" game of dice where you're trying to roll monsters with better then your neighbors. If your monsters survive a trip around the table, they score points.

Played as: 4 player

Pros: Has it's own unique spin on a "deck-building" game. It's a lot easier to pull dice out of a bag, then constantly shuffling cards. Any game with this many pretty dice has pizazz and is going to draw attention from any passers by. Has that satisfying feeling of throwing a handful of heavy plastic.

Cons: It's not as accessible of a game as you would expect for something as light as it is. I didn't like how the abilities of your dice are listed in small text on a card that's central to everyone. Leaning and squinting over text is not at all relaxing. Somehow lacks that tension/excitement that dice usually bring to whatever game they are part of. Expensive, and unfortunately you're paying up for the bunch of custom, sparkly dice rather than a particularly stellar design with lots of mileage.

Other: My overall impression of it was it's ok, but not as good of a "deck-building" game as Dominion and not as good as a dice game as Roll Through the Ages. The biggest killer is you could buy both those games combined for about the same price as just Quarriors. That alone makes it a tough game to justice my recommendation.

Best Use: Probably not bad for a casual time after players get a couple games under their belts.

I feel you have pretty no control over what happens in this game.  You could be making all of the right decisions and still get absolutely crushed.  Maybe this is what luck SHOULD do in a game, but only to an extent.  Too random and chaotic for me.  Mildly fun though.

Deck building with dice.  And that pretty much sums it up.  If you think dice a wicked cool, you'd probably dig this.  If you hate the random factor of the dice or if you are convinced that the dice are trying to kill you, you might want to pass.  Personally, I think its a good game.  The more I play it the more I start to really get into it.  My game group is OK with it as well so it can make it to the table fairly easily

I feel that the rating may change a bit with more plays.  Right now, I feel like the game is a bit all over the place.  I just wish there was a 2.0 ruleset that locks down the game somewhat.  As it stands, it feels like more of a playset than a truly defined game.

However, the gameplay is a lot of fun.  It lends itself to some strategic thinking while acceptance that anything can happen is always present.  I seems to strike a weird balance in me of trying hard to win, and yet not caring what happens.  That is certainly some form of success.

The Quests definitely add a lot.  I'm still undecided about the Expert Culling rule, but feel it's basically necessary even though it definitely hampers the feeling of engine-building strategy.

As it stands, there is a LOT of game with all the expansions, in a pretty small box, so I think I'll have this one for a long time.

I like this a lot more than Dominion, and the way they use the cards to change the characteristics of the creatures is rather clever.  Like the dice rolling and the way you can cycle the dice out, and a fair variety of creatures/spells to choose from.  Nice dice and presentation.

I love the concept, the dice, the cards, but I can't get passed two issues. First, I hate buying things and then not getting to use them. If I invest in a dragon, I want to use that bad-a$$. But I might only get to use him once in a game. Secondly, combat is very anticlimatic. I want more. It also suffers from the same problem I have with all deck-building games, which is you generally have very few decisions on a turn. You get what you get in your hand, and that's pretty much it. In Quarriors, if you roll a creature, you pretty much put him into play every time. No decision needed. So the game can probably use some more depth. Nice concept though, and I'd be happy to play this to finish out a night.

RATING: 7
A nice dice deck-builder. Fun and simple to learn and play.

I don't really like the combat/scoring mechanism. It's a bit too luck-based to have your dice survive the round or not and it can get quite slow. This is mitigated slightly by the Quartifacts-expansion.

Still a great game with tons of variety. I really like how they keep the same dice, and just change the card that tells you how the faces work.

With the added expansions you end up with a ridiculous amount of cards that will provide so much replay value it's ridiculous. The more you get the better!

They took the silliness and fun of a game like [thing=1860][/thing], streamlined it so it's not just a chuck-and-hand-full-of-dice skirmish and combined it with the purchasing and drawing of [thing=36218][/thing]. Good fun, with plenty of variation. Just understand that it's not a highly strategic game and go with it.

Better than I expected - yes, obviously, there's randomness. But, randomness only bothers me when I actually give a shit. And I can play this without. However, the dice do not make the game any faster - you spend more time craning your neck to try to read the text on the cards, taking your glasses on or off, than you ever would shuffling. I'll still probably buy the LotR version when that comes out.

Interesting game. A little difficulty to comprehend at the beginning (attributed to the inadequacy of the game rulebook) but when the game got going, it is pretty straight-forward and fun. 

Basic set on its own doesn't stand well - will definitely require the Quarriors! Rise of the Demons to complement it. This adds more between the players interaction and influencing of how the game progresses.

Giving it 7 instead unless combined with (both) the expansions of which the score will increase to 8.

RATING: 7
Spectacular fun once you figure everything out and the game runs smoothly. The addition of dice to the deckbuilding concept adds some wonderful drama to each turn, since dice rolls can be very lucky or very unlucky, and yet there still is a combo effect that makes it all about choosing the right dice to add to your pool.

However, as with all dice/deckbuilders, after you've played it enough, you realize just how shallow the waters are, and the only thing that renews them is expansions. Thus it falls into the CCG trap of demanding constant $ investment to be fun/playable. A really unfortunate aspect.

It is frustrating that no matter how good of monster dice you get, there is a still a 50/50 chance that you will not roll a monster.  It also seems silly that it can be so difficult to trash dice, buy more than 1 dice a turn, or roll more than 6 dice a turn.

Although I enjoy a good bit of randomness in games, and I also enjoy dice games, I just don't find Quarriors all that interesting. It's fiddly and inelegant. I commend the designers for the idea, and I see how expansions might improve the game. In my view, it's not quite there yet.

It's fun enough, but it has way too quick of a "ramping up" period. You can effectively buy the best "card" in the game on your very first turn if your roll even marginally well. There's no real feeling of "deck" development or progression. Costs of "summoning" the units are also way too low, which means you don't really have to give up a lot to get your army going.

The game clearly isn't designed to present players with difficult decisions, but rather to just let them have some fun rolling dice and beating each other over the head with fantasy creatures with cool super-powers. I bought the super-awesomest unit in the game on my first roll and pretty much sailed on to victory [no other unit in the game could kill him!].

Furthermore, the game would be a lot more fun if the dice were bigger and/or you had a card in front of you summarizing the dice you had bought. Yes, it [i]works[/i], but in a game where "neat looking dice" is one of the chief appeals [possibly the only appeal] to have them so small and have so little stuff on the table is less than impressive.

It's Dominion using dice instead of cards.  Although I am not excited about this game, I'd like to try it out some more to see if it becomes more enjoyable after more games.  The added randomness of rolling the dice makes it a bit chaotic for my liking, and there's a steep learning curve because when you buy a dice you are buying six different things, and after a game you will be less certain about the power of the dice you bought, since you may have just rolled well or poorly with it.  Also, the Q thing doesn't make the game more enjoyable, imho.

This game doesn't really work very well with 2 players. Once a person establishes a victory point lead it is incredibly difficult to catch up to or even surpass them. Additionally, culling is a bad mechanic. All it does is allow the person who is already winning fine tune their dice bag even more. The two player game needs to be house ruled to be competetive. The standard game plays fine with 3 or more.

Amalgame bien le hasard de la pige au hasard de la valeur de ce qui est pigé. Du hasard au carré!

Pas vraiment de choix: on acquiert généralement ce qui vaut le plus cher en fonction des "manas" disponibles. De plus, la grande majorité des créatures offrent 50% de chance d'attaquer, et 50% de produire du "mana". Il manque le côté "gambling/conservateur" qu'offriraient par exemple certaines créatures qui le sont réellement sur cinq, voire les six faces du dé, versus une créature très puissante, mais sur une seule face.

Pas vraiment de stratégie: on semble pouvoir prendre les meilleures décisions et perdre malgré tout. On brasse et rebrasse, on fait un peu n'importe quoi, et puis ça marche ou pas et finalement hop, quelqu'un a gagné et c'est fini.

Le concept pouvait sembler prometteur. Mais dans l'application, je ne vois ni fun, ni intérêt à ce jeu.

NOTE: La règle semble mal écrite et manquer d'explications supplémataires concernant chaque créatures. Les "mats" à découper, pas l'idée du siècle non plus pour un jeu de ce prix.

I don't know what it is exactly but I really like this game! Maybe it is all the really cool dice or the fun of trying to work with what you roll. There is a little bit of strategy, but this game is mostly luck. Many people will not like this game if they come into thinking it they can setup combos and synergy like in other deckbulders. I will never play this game without the additoinal capture from the wilds. Two captures from the wilds really makes this game fun and exciting as the decisions are much more involved. The game is simply fun! I do recommend trying before you buy though as this game is not for everyone.

I LOVE dice. Love 'em.

Quarriors is a game that heavily requires a lot of luck to win at. You can choose which creatures to invest in, but all-in-all, if you don't roll them to be summoned, they're useless to you. 

You're forced to attack as soon as you summon a creature and it'd be interesting to allow players to keep them out on the board to attack as they wish before scoring them along the Glory Track. That would require an overhaul of the game, which will not happen.

A few expansions exist and they don't seem to add too much by way of game-changing experience as they're typically just more creatures and a few new spells. 

It's a fun game, just not terribly deep or strategic, which can kill its replay value. If you love the luck of the roll, give this one a shot.

Really like all of the dice, cards, and the related game equipment.  My kids enjoy playing it.  I find it very random.  The good thing about that is that I can try my hardest and still lose when playing them.  The bad thing about that is that the randomness makes it seem like less of an accomplishment when winning.

I read reviews saying I shouldn't judge this game by what it is NOT (not a deckbuilder, not very deep - even though it claims to be "uber strategic" and "a deck builder without the shuffeling" in bold letters on the front of the box), but by what it IS. But what it IS, is a mindless, dice chucking luck fest, and I am judging it as such.
I wanted to like this game, I just really don't.
I ended up giving it away to a friend that doesn't mind the huge luck factor.

A deck building game with a very big twist. You're all building the same deck and the luck of the roll plays a vital but non-critical role. If you roll your die right, you'll have a big advantage, but building up the deck properly requires a fair amount of thought. Once everyone gets a hang of the rules, it's a very quick game that can take on wide range of forms, and it can also be a ton of fun even if you only have two people.

Quarriors is a "dice building" game very similar to Dominion in that you are progressively building a collection of dice.  The scoring mechanic is the biggest difference.  Rather than rolling scoring dice, creature dice are rolled which, if they survive the round, then score victory points.  After several games I've found that I like Quarriors just fine, but it isn't one of my top favorites.  I'm glad to have it on hand as it is easy to explain and a great gateway game.  So much luck is involved, however, that I can't say that I will often recommend this to my hardcore group.

Quarriors! takes the resource pool and starting deck ideas from deckbuilding games like Dominion and converts them to dice which sextuples the possibilities of what each draw and purchase can become beyond just the order of how the player's 'deck' is 'shuffled'. The shuffling that would occur in a regular deck-builder is streamlined here as well; you just gather up and roll the dice. Easy!

The negative side of reducing most of the gaming components to dice is the table is literally empty. There is no eye candy and combat is reduced to numbers with nothing to prime players' imaginations.

After a few plays we have discovered that some of the dice suck, no matter which version of description card gets pulled.

A fun 'deck' building dice game.  Just like in Dominion you are acquiring cards that beef up your deck so that when you are drawing cards you hope you are drawing cards that will help you win the game...but 'cards' are actually dice in this game!

There does not seem to be too many decisions to make and sometimes it can get drawn out, but so far I am still enjoying it sparingly.

At first, I was going to complain that this game is too random. Then I remembered that I'm playing a game based around rolling tons of dice, and came to my senses. It's a fun game, but the lightness of it is offset a bit too much by the complication in the cards. Having to constantly refer to the cards in the middle of the table is a bit inconvenient. It would have been nice if there were multiple copies of the cards so that players could reference them while playing more easily. I guess my only complaint is that I didn't really feel like I was in control of what was going on with my game, so while I wouldn't refuse to play again I wouldn't go out of my play to play.

RATING: 6.5
It has many virtues: fun, fast, fresh, easy to teach... 

But it has one big problem: it's not balanced. Some creatures are almost worthless (even the expensive ones) and some others are great (great defense that allow to score them easily + other creatures you get in the same roll, etc.). That limits very much the winning strategies and it's the diference between the good game it is and the great, great game it would be if balanced.

Depending on the number of players, there are always some dice that are better than others. By far, the most balanced games are 1vs1. The game works very well on those games.

A minor problem (solved with expert culling rules): most games finish too fast, so:
· long term strategies not worthy
· at midgame, you limit the number of dice you can buy even more: you can only take the ones that provide short term benefits

Anyways, luck is heavily involved and these issues do not kill the game. When played fast, the game is still fun to play.

The dice quality is questionable.

There are a couple of house rules that really improve the game:
- You can buy 2 dice per turn, not just one.
- You have to cull the creature dice you score with.

These house rules increase the value of minor dice and spells, and contributes to see much more varied strategies. After almost 150 games, I see these house rules make a huge difference.

Also, the Quartifacts expansion adds a the missions mechanic that really add a new level of depth to the game it didn't have before. I don't want to play Quartifacts without the expansion anymore, except, maybe 2 player games. I still have to try the expert culling house rules with it.

After several games I rate this a 7 - maybe a 6 if it didn't have cool dice. Having loads of cool dice is great but it adds to the luck factor. We have had a couple of run away leader games, and one come from behind (come from no wher victory) but win or loose its fun. It doesn't take long either which is probably spot on given the luck factor. I thinks its best with 2 or 3 but time will tell.

Fait partie du top 5 de mes jeux préférés.
Une très bonne découverte avec ce jeu de dés où l'on manipule la chance comme on peut pour poutrer les autres :-)
Son seul défaut à ma connaissance serait qu'il y a des créatures chéatées comme le dragon dans toutes ses versions dérivées. Pour y remédier c'est simple, je l'enlève de la pioche en début de partie pour que le jeu ne tourne pas uniquement autour de lui.
Un autre reproche un peu moins lié au jeu en lui-même mais plus à l'édition serait que l'édition française est de moins bonne qualité que l'édition anglaise/internationale : rien pour ranger les dés et les dés ne sont pas toujours bien lisibles. C'est pareil pour les extensions, il faut faire attention à ne pas se faire avoir : Quarmageddon en VO est fournit avec une boite de rangement de dés très pratique alors que la VF pour le même prix se passe de cette boîte...

My opinion has dropped a bit.  I still enjoy the dice, the art, and the feel of the game.  However, not rolling creatures hurts just way too much that it affects the game more in my opionion than strategy or tactical choices.

Update:  I played a few games with the advanced rules and I like it a lot more.  When you remove dice when scoring then it adds another layer of choices and makes it so that one player getting a big dice early doesn't lead to a rout.

Played 3 games in a row and was sufficiently stumped as to why some cards are so overpowered than others. Cards like the strong primordial ooze and the strong quake dragon makes the game really unbalanced towards those owning multiple copies of them. The variant rule where you'll have to cull your creature after scoring them made the game end with a closer finish albeit longer playing time. It will be one that we will be playing with more often now. Need more plays of this to justify keeping it.

A lot of dice! Dominion on dice! This is an addictive game. You begin the game with a base set of dice and a bag. And like Dominion there will be descriptive cards out for you to purchase...wait...not purchase cards...but purchase dice off from the cards. So you go to the Quarry (or village in Dominion) and purchase the dice you will need. Similar to Dominion (when you build your deck with the cards you purchase)you will be collecting dice to build your bag of dice. So simple. 

The game is quick to play maybe a bit faster than Dominion. The dice battle your opponents dice with their unique special powers all notated on the dice. Fun and strategic game! The rulebook however, is a little convoluted with annoying Q's.

My only beef is that it doesn't seem like you get to do much chaining of abilities.  That may be due to only playing 2-player.  The game seemed over too soon, didn't get to capture enough creatures from the wild.

Quarriors is like Dominion but not as good. I only played 2 games so didn't see everything, but Dominion has quite a few game changer cards that are very different to the vanilla "+1X +2Y's" style cards and turn the game upside down and inside out. Chapel, Gardens, Witch spring to mind.

Quarrior dice felt like lots of flavours of vanilla - the expensive dice were mostly scaled up versions of the cheaper dice. Dice! Yes you roll them, so it's like a card with 6 possible states, though typically a dice will either give you:
A. money (called 'Quiddity' which I rather like) or
B. it's power (thematically one of your minions or a spell you are casting). Some of the dice have a third kind of side that will be 'A/B' or allow a re-roll of another dice.
So sometimes you'd rather have A but roll B and vice versa. Yes, sometimes you can re-roll them, depending on which dice you buy, but then you have to roll the re-roll, and the re-roll dice itself is taking up one space of your hand size, so I am pretty confident there is more luck in Quarriors.

The way you score VPs is different to Dominion, imagine instead of buying a Duchy and that Duchy being a dead card, you play a Duchy from your hand and then if it gets back round to you with your Duchy still there, you score 3 VPs and discard the Duchy. When you play your Duchy it immediately attacks all other peoples VP cards - that's how you might not score. Again this will come down to luck - if you have a big scoring monster out you either will or will not score for it, depending on whether your opponents managed to roll their monster or if they rolled money. Rolling money is bad in the late game, because you can't directly buy VPs in a can. Dominions scoring with 'dead cards' was better IMO, ingenious even. I guess the gimmick, the main appeal of Quarriors (dice rolling) is it's main flaw. Perhaps it is silly to play a game made of dice and complain about the luck.

Not a particularly deep game, actually quite shallow.  However, collecting and throwing colored dice is fun!  I liked this game alright with two players, I think it could be more strategic with four players when it is harder to get points.  The decisions are mostly easy, and the roll ultimately determines your fate.  Yet, drawing the dragon as your sixth die and dropping a level three still feels cool.  This was an interesting take on the deck building genre, and while I do not think it leads anywhere (even with future attempts in different games) it was worth a try.

An interesting take on the deck-building genre, using dice instead of cards, but they've made something so devoid of decision making and so luck bound that, although it was an ok pastime, it didn't engage me at all. Your starting dice have gold on them, you roll them, see how much gold you've earned, and buy a new dice from the 10 different types of dice on offer. Add it to your discard pile. When eventually you get through your dice, add your discard pile back into your bag, draw 6 more and so on - same as a deck. When eventually you get to roll your newly bought dice, it could come up with more gold (frustrating) but hopefully will roll up a creature or spell. Creatures have an attack number and a defense number, so the total value of the creatures you deploy on your turn attacks each other player in turn, killing off creatures with lower defense. If your creatures can survive until your next turn, then you score VPs. The problem is you can study all the creature and spell powers, buy good combinations, buy the best you can, and then never have the dice you want in the same roll together, or the creature dice don't actually roll on the creature side so you can't earn VPs. And after the initial accumulation moves, it just takes a few good rolls by one player to end the game quite quickly before you get a chance to really use and re-use stuff. There's little or no dice manipulation, so the decisions to make on your turn are what to re-roll if you get a re-roll (trivial), and then what to buy with your money, which might seem interesting at first blush, but turns out to be rather less consequential than you'd hope given you'll only see each dice a few times and on half of those nothing will happen. Btw downtime is pure ... there's nothing to do on other player's turns except study what you might want to buy next turn. All up, less than it might have been.

What I liked:
- Rolling dice is generally fun
- Shaking dice in a bag is more fun than shuffling cards
- Despite complaints that there are no decisions in the game, I found there were some
- All the cards probably give the game replayability

What I didn't like:
- Our 4p game took almost 2 hours, and we weren't going slow
- The dice are hard to read (fine print, poor colors)
- The cards are hard to read (fine print, center of table) and/or memorize
- Some leader-bashing (via spells)
- I don't like games with direct attacking, although I appreciate that most of the attacks in this game are not directed at individuals (but see spells above)

Overall, not a game I would want to play again. I might be interested in a Dominion-like dice-based deck-building game (not based on attacks), but the reliance on those cards in the center of the table is a real negative for me. I did cull dice, but didn't have the same deck-building feel that I get with Dominion.

If the game really lasted 15-30 minutes, it would be far more appealing. Maybe we just got a *really* bad set of cards in the quarry, but it didn't seem like a bad mix, with cards of various values, and with both attacks and defenses.

The weight of 1.9 seems about right, with the sometimes-complex special abilities of the different creatures and spells.

A nice option to deck-building games. The massive amount of creatures to pick from to start a game makes each play different. I like it better than games like Nightfall as when you get a creature(s) out they attack everyone instead of one selected player. 

The dice quality could've been a little better but still good for the price.

Clever game idea - build a "deck" of dice and try to keep your creatures alive long enough to score points with them.  Relatively easy to learn, though the rules could have used a sample turn or two to illustrate things a tad more clearly than just a read through.  Engaging and interesting.  Very strong components and concept.

Fun with lots of dice and i mean LOTS! It is Dominion with less strategy, more tactics and using dice instead of cards!

My score is based on Quarriors played with the variant found in the Quarmageddon rules (up to 2 buys and culling the dice you score with).

RATING: 5
nice deck building game - much like dominion - the difference for me is not the shuffling of the cards, but that dice can show a different symbol each time you draw them, as opposed to cards: more uncertainty/luck. You may like this or not. It makes a clear strategy impossible and hence is a filler game, that plays fast. 
It gets minus one point for bad quality of the dice: poor printing and too small text.
And don't get me talking about the quality of the translation into german :soblue:

RATING: 5
Basically a dice version of Dominion. However, since you use dice, there is a lot of luck in it. You buy dice to add to your hand and then when you roll them you get money or monsters. However each dies action depends on the roll. Some sides are weak and others are strong. So if you have good dice but bad rolls, you are out of luck. Also turn order is very important since the first player will get his monsters out first and the monsters defense is not always well balanced with the attacks. Not really for me, but may be fun for some.

As advertised, this is a deck-building game with dice instead of cards, and it feels very much like a deck-builder.  A lot of people complain that adding dice on top of a random draw makes for too much randomness, but it didn't really feel that way to me.  My main complain with the game is that everything felt too samey--the various dice you could buy were not very different from one another, and I felt like I was doing the same thing turn after turn.

Playtime: ~20-40 minutes.

Comment: This game is really almost all luck and has very few decisions to make. I get what it's trying to be, but it doesn't work at all in my opinion. You almost always want to buy the most expensive thing and depending on what you roll, your turn is pretty much laid out for you. You can do everything right and still lose horribly. Also, winning this game feels so empty. You won, but who cares? You don't feel as if you earned it, just that you rolled better than all the other players. Pass on this game.

Optimal Player Count: 3 > 2 > 4

Extras: Mayday premium sleeves on cards.

Note: The advanced rules almost need to be played with to make this remotely fun. Buy 2 dice instead of one and possibly the Score and Cull the creature or return it to the used dice pile rule. It's just too boring without those and fairly imbalanced in my opinion. Also, this still doesn't solve the "meh" factor in my opinion. It became only slightly more strategic but still is very lackluster.

Includes Quaxos promo cards.

Great idea, but a little underdeveloped. I would give this game a 9 as the rating only if there weren´t some design flaws. I love games where you realize how genious the design is and could not really think of how it could be better. Unfortunately Quarriors is not one of those. This game instantly makes you think about many possible things that could be done differently in the design. I predict there will be other dicebag building games coming out with better design some day. But so far this game has to suffice.. =)

I like Dominion/Thunderstone and dice, however this game was a little bit of a letdown.  I liked attacking everyone and how the actions had some risk/luck involved.  I think its rule on culling dice is broken and causes a runaway leader effect.

It's fun to roll dice, and this game has that in spades, and it's good to have a game where my wife and I win in equal measures, but this game just doesn't have enough meat on its bones, and too many of the cards are piles of junk that will never be useful. There needs to be some tweaks in the system to make this into a truly enjoyable pastime. Hopefully an upcoming expansion can fix that.

It is sort of dominion with dice, but only in the dice drafting mechanic, but that is where the similarities end.

There's a lot of bad random mechanics which make it straight up worse than other "deck" building games. Not only are your "cards" random, but their effect is random as well. There is some strategy, which generally is choosing econ vs. attack, but more often than not it will come down to luck.

It's not great as a party game because of the setup time. I honestly don't know who is supposed to love this game. Buy it if you love rolling dice.

7/15/12 - I remember when this was the hottest game in town and everyone wanted it so badly. I waited anxiously for it to release and when it did the reviews on it were mixed so I held off on buying it for a long time. I was able to play it once with a game group and it turned out to be really fun. I don't like the fact that it's 4 player max and the purchase choices can become repetitious but the game is a fun dicefest. I really would like to see how Quarmageddon changes the base game. It could possibly bump up my score.

11/04/12 - Bumping the score up .5 to 7. Quarriors is a little better. The dice quality sucks. Some of the images are rubbing off and some are just blurry. Still sem-fun.

11/07/12 - Ok, I'm dumping this game. It's not very fun anymore. I'm bumping it down to 6 and trading it

"Randomness on randomness". I like the idea of dice building over deck building because you don't have to shuffle. Sadly you have to draw your dice.

Only 2 plays so far (which is very little), but I'm failing to see the balance problems people are babbling about.

It is a simples game and it does seem a little raw still. However, it's got an amazing production value and plays bolt fast.

I have read about the variants* the designers suggested and they seem to add a lot to the game. I'm planning on testing them soon.

*Variants:
- Instead of scoring the creature and moving it to the used pile, keep it and do not score.
- You may capture up to 2 dice from the wilds on your turn (as long as you can pay for both, obviously).
- Dragon grants only 3 glory points (this one is a most in my opinion).

Veredict: not a great game, but a very pleasant one. I'll hardly refuse to play it. I was very concerned about this one, but it delivered more than I expected (yet less than I ideally think it ought to).

There is so much fun to be had in such a short period of time.  I'm delighted with this game, even if it does occasionally play out very lop-sided.  The best part is that I feel like the amount of time for a game is just right, so that you just start another one up right away.

It is just so much fun to watch the dice roll out and see whether or not you or your opponents got what you wanted.  I can't tell you the number of times loud groans and/or cheers have been heard around the table after a particular roll.

This is essentially Dominion in a dice format; much less shuffling but equivalent die rolling. Although probably about the same it feels like luck is more pronounced. The Dominion cards are simpler, this game has cards that need study beforehand. And this game has a very strong 'rich get richer' aspect that may often decide the game 1/2 way through. I only rate it higher than Dominion because it is MUCH shorter.

RATING: 6
Quarriors delivers a highly imperfect experiential version of its promised concept.  

The concept: drafted armies magically summoned and fighting one another, accruing victory points for surviving a full round of onslaught.

The mechanic: drafted dice that when rolled either give energy to summon or represent the monster to be summoned.

The flaw: You must do the following 1)Roll dice and hope for high energy to purchase good dice 2) hope to pull a good collection of dice randomly from your bag 3) roll the dice you've purchased and hope that they actually deliver on their highest potential.

If anything goes wrong in the above chain, the game almost instantly creates a massive disparity in success with momentum spiking insurmountably high after only 3-4 turns. Doesn't happen every time, but many games end in such a way.  

Thus the game is hard to recommend as anything other than a light bit of randomness, meant to not be taken seriously.  As such it can be fun.

RATING: 7
Really like this game. It's much easier to learn if you're familiar with Dominion since they follow a similar principle. My complaints are that the terminology is a little confusing and could be done better and that the dice are so small that you lose some important detail (like small asterisks on only one or two sides are hard to see, or small numbers.) Biggest thing to watch out for is remembering to check which side of the die your monster has landed on and to check it's card because it's easy to forget nuances to the monsters. Might also be nice if there were 5 cards per monster, one to leave in the middle, one for each player as they purchase a die so that you don't have 4 people straining to read all the cards in the middle constantly.
Overall, great fun.

Brilliant game, focusing and what's board gaming is about - having fun with something you can touch and feel. Refreshing approach to deckbuilding. Nothing beats that nice feeling when you shake your bag with dice before drawing. If you like dice, you should get this game, it's an absolute blast. It takes no more than hour, works great with 2 as well as with 4.

Ignore all those comments about "total randomness". It's as much random as dice can be, but there's quite a lot of decisions to be made. I don't know if people realize that there's huge chunk of math and probability being involved here and that you in fact have good amount of control over the content of your bag and thus the overall chance of coming out with desired outcome. If you pack lots of monsters, the chance you will roll more monsters increases. If you load your bag with quiddity, you will definitely buy some good dice soon, etc, etc. Of course, you can get a perfect set of dice, yet still be unfortunate with your roll, but a) it can STILL be mitigated by dice that allow you to re-roll! b) it just sometimes happens. That's the charm of board game, random weird situations happen, it would be a boringfest if you would just win all the time. But it's rarely a total screwage that will prevent you from winning the game. There's lot of suspense and tension, first when drawing your dice, second, when the actual roll happens. 

Depending on what spells and monsters are on the table, you can go different ways - build your strategy around lots of dice, attached spells, offensive spells, defensive creature abilities, side-effect creature abilities, lots of cheap creatures, one-two expensive creatures... geez, it's really a lot. One of the best games I've played.

Serious drawback is the dice quality, though. It's less than stellar. You'll find at least few of your dice to be borked in a certain way. You can replace some of them, but even then it's not the end of the world, as all the dice faces are repeated on cards, or you can usually just take another dice from table. Still, I don't like it. If you spend your $$$ on game, it should be perfect.

Not as shitty as I expected considering that I don't like Dominion or any deck building games.

One reason for liking this game is that it's very tactile: lots of different dice in a variety of colours. It's way more fun drawing dice than shuffling cards.

What, to me, makes this appealing is that I can play this game with as little thought and thinking as possible.

For a game as brainless as this, it's the perfect length! Too bad setup is a bit of a bitch.

Initially I was very taken with Quarriors.  It was different to all the usual deck-building games, promised lots of variety and felt fresh.  But the more I played it, the more I fell out of love with it. 

For one thing, it started to feel more and more like a beta release; the rules were significantly altered with one of the early expansions when the designers realised that the game wasn't working properly.  This was confirmed as more  expansions were released and the system trotted out for other, similar games.

More significantly perhaps was my growing realisation that the game offered very few interesting decision points.  Buying dice during your turn?  Get the best you can.  Putting dice into play?  Obvious.  Attacking and blocking?  The same.

I'd stopped playing it before Marvel Dice Masters was released, but almost straight away it was clear to me that MDM was by far the better game, with many, many more meaningful decisions to be made.  Shame it's not multiplayer.

I like this game my two major complains are the writing on the dice can be hard to follow.  Also it is very easy to win.  Even my youngest figured out by the highest fighting dice.  Perhaps one the expansions fixes this but I have not gotten any more in a bit since Quarmageddon.  I also have not played this game in a bit, so I am going to have to break it out again and get some of the expansions to see how they alter gameplay if any.

It's true that this game is both fun and light.  I had a somewhat rocky start with how I felt about this one, but as I'm getting multiple plays in, it is definitely growing on me.

This game was a big surprise. I'm not a fan of deck-building games, but it turns out i'm mostly just not a fan of shuffling decks. The dice streamline the game so much and it doesn't hurt that both the dice and cards are nice to look at.

My biggest complaint about the game is there isn't enough variety with the cards and the creatures aren't all that balanced.

It's starting to feel like more of an activity than a game. Two player is horrible and I have yet to have a satisfying two player experience.

Very interesting pool-building type game that uses dice as your pool to draw from and cards that are essentially used for  reference.  This is a great quick experience and just fun if you don't take it totally serious.  Although, it seems the better player will win or at least be competitive, this is a dice rolling game and sometimes the dice just don't cooperate.  Luckily this can be play in 30 minutes or less so the frustration is limited.   Tons and tons of replay-ability with this one as there are a lot of character dice and multiple characters of each set of dice that all have different powers. Only real draw back is it is a bit tedious to set up.

A big disappointment for me - the premise of the game (deck-building with dice!) seemed exciting, but it turns out to be a fairly tedious dice-chucker which, while not totally devoid of strategy, depends far more on luck than on skill and which isn't even all that much fun to play.

Love, love, love this game.  More importantly, my boys (10 & 8) love it as well.  There is enough luck that keeps them interested and able to win, and the game is done in half an hour.  Seriously, how could you not love a game that has 130 custom dice!

I still favor Dominion because of the strategy, but you can't beat this game for the amount of fun had in a short amount of time.  Looking forward to the expansions!

The current emperor's new clothes.
There really isn't much strategy available, mainly due to the fact that you do nothing unless the dice allow.

It's Yahtzee with cutesy symbols.

Let's face it, people love to roll dice, even for meaningless purposes.
And this one is relatively purposeless.

It gets a 4 simply for the fun of rolling odd symbol dice.

Downgraded to a one for a couple reasons.

1. You should NEVER be able to buy the highest priced item on the first roll. Ever.

2. Every game I've played has had a huge gap between the winner and EVERYONE else.
This rarely happens with good games and never with great games.

Tristen's game 

It plays like Dominion with dice. I like the concept, but play seems uneven, the numbers on the original dice are too small, and I hate referring to the cards to know what my dice does. I hear the new promotion may fix the uneveness of play, and the first expansion already fixed the small number problem. We'll probably buy Quarmagedon because I want to give this game a chance.

RATING: 5
Clever idea that doesn't work.

Three basic problems:
-  Draw randomly from a bag and then roll dice and hope you get lucky you rolled a lot of 2's to buy the best card or a large creature worth a lot of points that can hold off the inevitable attacks.
-  Those decisions are basically obvious--buy the most expensive die you can.  If you have a re-roll, use it to re-roll the best die that became money.  Attack the strongest opposing die you can--with special emphasis to the player on the left.  Etc.
-  Aren't these two problems enough?

RATING: 5
the dice have too much variance; could have been great but wasn't.  At least you roll a lot of cool dice.  A few interesting choices, but too many of my games stalled out due to the set of cards dealt out initially.  There need to be free rerolls or something like that to reduce variance and introduce more choices, and probably a complete overhall of the individual cards.  But the core structure is great.

RATING: 7
Not sure if the game has much strategy in it. The game looks to finish so fast, there is no time to fix bad luck with the quiddich being low on the first few turns to buy good dice, specially if there is any kind of imbalance on the strong creatures without too much counters.

RATING: N/A
Seems very promising! A "deck-building" game with dice instead of cards.

Seems like there may be very little strategy in what to buy each turn. It's a shame that designers may have missed so badly on a core idea during playtesting, assuming of course, that it's true.

After a couple of games of this, not sure what to make of it. Is it Dominoin? Is it Magic the Gathering? I don't know. Some games are just better than others.

Thoughts after first play:

Pros:
- Super fast set up
- Easy to learn and teach
- Compact box.

Cons:
- Seems like players can have an awful string of luck and not be able to do much about it.  As a result it can feel overly luck based even though there is strategy involved.  

General Notes:
- Having player mats seems necessary as it is hard to tell what's what in front of a player without them.

Personally I'm really enjoying this game.  It scratches a similar itch as Dice Masters without some of the added complexity and we can play with more players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Fun to try out, but I don't see any improvements over Dominion.  I understand the expansions are supposed to introduced more combos/synergy that the base game seems to be lacking, but as I've already invested in several Dominion expansions, I don't see myself investing in Quarriors+expansions.  Quarriors lacks the critical Dominion mechanic where as you buy victory points, you reduce your ability to buy more in the future; in Quarriors, buying big monsters is always good - they increase your purchasing power (usually have 2 or more faces with $2), have strong attacks to stop opponents from scoring points, and have strong defense and the highest victory point values. And of course, since you're rolling dice, you can get screwed by chance if you just fail to roll monster faces on your monster dice to summon them, which means you ar both unable to stop your opponents from scoring points and cannot score points yourself.  Lastly, in theory it should be more fun to shake dice in a bag and randomly draw them than to constantly shuffle cards, in practice constantly having to take exactly 6 dice out of the bag, or taking the last 2 and then putting the rest in the bag to shake and take 4, is more fiddly.  This is compounded by having dice that trigger off what dice opponents have in their used area, meaning players have to wait until their turn before refilling their bag, unlike Dominion where players can shuffle their discard pile during opponents' turns.

Two Player Value = Good, but more competitive with more players.

Three Player Value = Good. 


Quarriors could be the ultimate dice game.  By that I mean it uses more dice then any other game ever.

Quarriors is a competitive deck pooling game that uses activated abilities of a die when rolled.  I think it is reasonable to say that most people will understand when I say it uses the Dominion deck pooling mechanic.  The difference here is that it uses dice, not cards, which is rather ingenious.  A six-sided die allows for six possible outcomes which means more variability in the game.  This is a fun idea.

Each turn the player draws and rolls six dice.  Since each side of each die may be different the player will have access to different activated abilities with each role.  This will further change with using different dice on each role for huge variation possibilities.

The deck pooling is handled nicely by using bags to contain the dice and draw dice from.

Quarriors is easy to learn and play making it a good choice for beginners or people new to gaming.

The interaction between the players is minimal as the players only affect each other during a single phase each turn.  This phase is used to attack the other player to prevent him from scoring.

The components of the game need to be noted.  Since the game is 98% dice I think good dice are important.  This is where Quarriors comes up short.  Many of the dice are not printed well.  The dice have poor moldings or the paint is missing in parts.  This makes those dice hard to read.  It is not done well and that is a shame.

The theme is really not integral to the game at all.  In fact, the game could work using just about any other theme imaginable.  However, I do not think that is a problem unique to this game, but rather a problem with the deck pooling mechanic in general.


Pros - 
- Tons of custom dice
- Fun to play
- easy to learn and good to beginners

Cons-
- Many poor quality dice

Here I will discuss the Quarriors expansion [thing=115098][/thing].

Overall I like this expansion and the additions it brings to the game.  

It does not change the base in any way other then adding new creatures and spells plus their associated dice.  But for this game I think that is a good thing.  The new dice help ramp up the variation and breath new life into the game.

One of the largest additions you gain with this expansion is the box.  The box for this expansion is large enough to hold this expansion, the base game and the Demons expansion.  It also has a very useful insert and cover that holds all the dice in place.  I truly loath most box inserts, but find this one to be fantastic in every way and is a big plus.

I will rate this expansion the same as the base game as it does not change the base game.  Therefore this expansion will carry the same rating as the base game.


[b]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[/b]


Here I will discuss the expansion [thing=106895][/thing].

For a small expansion Rise of the Demons does a fair amount to alter the base game.  I like the way it adds to the base.

This expansion brings a new type of dice into the game which is cursed and bad for the player to own.  This is a fun new mechanic and works to choke the players draw bag.  Players will need to find a way to deal with cursed dice.

These cursed dice are given to players by their opponents by using new cursed versions of each character from the base game.  These new cursed characters are accompanied by a new character Demon Lord character which is extremely powerful.

Playing with a few of these cards is great way to mix-up the game.

With this expansion I will rate the base game one tenth higher.  I think this makes the strategy of the game that little bit better.  This will bring the game to - 

Overall Playability = 7.3


[b]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[/b]


Here I will discuss the expansion [thing=103610][/thing].

Thes expansion does very little to add to the game.

This is simply three overpowered versions of base game characters.  They are fun to play with, but do little else.

This does not change the rating of the game.


[b]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[/b]


Here I will discuss the Quarriors expansion [thing=128709][/thing].

At this point in the expansion history of Quarriors, the expansions feel fairly set, excepting the two smaller ones.  Each contains the same number of creatures, spells and dice. 

These six new creatures bring one small addition to the game, the ability to lock a die.  While this is neither a new mechanic, nor greatly used in this expansion, it does add just enough to change the game in a positive way.

This small positive chance is mostly due to the fact that each lockable die has a beneficial lock ability and a detrimental lock ability.  This makes for more strategic decision when choosing dice.

Also of note is the fact that the quality and appearance of the dice have improved.  The dice are much better in this expansion.

While I do like this small change and the expansion, it would only alter my overall rating of the game by one tenth most due to the better quality dice.


Overall Playability = 7.4


[b]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[/b]


Here I will discuss the Quarriors expansion [thing=137496][/thing].

This is where I think the game begins to take an odd turn as the designers try to add to expansion formula.

In this expansion the normal formula is kept by adding the same number of creatures and spells as prior.  In addition a new mechanic is added; the ability to go on quests to possibly find powerful artifacts.

While I understand the desire to add new mechanics to the game so to expand  what actions the players have available to them, I find the new questing mechanic clunky and odd.  

The game is played normally.  However, now when players roll creatures they have the option of sending them to the quest card instead of just attacking their opponent.  Creatures at the quest card battle in the normal way.  Instead of scoring creatures at the beginning of the turn, those creatures now complete the quest.  Completed quests yield bonuses for the player.

I like the idea of the quests, but in practice they are rather useless.

I do like the new creatures and the quality of the dice is still very good.

GenCon 2011 purchase.  Ten minutes into the demo, my friend and I both knew we were buying it1  Three plays so far, and it's slightly different each time.  Can't wait for the expansions!  

I feel this game should have a higher win condition.  It would allow for a fuller strategy to be developed and implemented.

Un juego de construir el mazo... pero sin cartas, no puede ser muy malo con esta premisa.
Juego con más chicha de la que parece, con menor factor suerte del que la gente piensa (aunque son dados y no niego que exista ese factor) y con partidas muy rápidas que te dejan con ganas de más. Perfecto para picajosos.

I didn't feel like my decisions had much impact on the outcome of this game. "Quake Dragon advantage" seemed to be everything in this game, because in the one setup we played, they literally could not be attacked by any other card. I won because I rolled the face that could not be Death Spelled, either. The only reason I found to like this game was the Candyland factor of doing something random and then carrying it out, which can honestly be relaxing.

After one game: Interesting, but I think it would work much better and be more balanced if each surviving creature gives only one point. In later rounds someone can get several 2 or 3 point creatures to play - and score almost the target score in one go - the previous points by other players then play no role. 
Big creatures have a better chance of surviving - I think that compensates not getting more points. (Or you could have a point limit that you can get in one round..)

Look, I know it's just meant to be a light dice game without a lot of stuff going on. I'm alright with that. But dice are used to promote tension and excitement, and Quarriors has neither of those. Fantastic presentation, and fine for others, but I don't ever need to play this one again.

A doubly-random (drawing compounded by rolling) "dice-building" game (imagine my disappointment when dice manufacturing wasn't actually what we were doing) with an aloof, boring combat system and no clear sense of accomplishment.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I love the colourful dice and their easy to understand symbols. Dice building adds a fun tangible experience to a deck building game with a larger luck element. Using the suggested victory point totals for winning leads to a faster game, but you rarely get tonuse the higher lvl dice. I'd recommend increasing winning totals by 5-10 points regardless of how many people you play with.

The major down side is repetitive gameplay. Even with a variety of monsters and spells that you can play with, there is little room to try different strategies.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Currently I have my doubts about this game. It has dice, lots of dice.Purchase  cards with your dice and hope they survive to score victory points. It seems as though the best strategy is to just buy the cards that will sore you the most VP's. There seems to be no reason's or special abilities on the lower value cards to justify purchase.

Maybe more plays will change my mind.

I bought Quarriors because I was searching for a light game that plays quickly. I hit the mother lode. I love this game. This game is the newest game in my collection and I have played it about 30 times in a two week period. I loved it so much that I went out and bought the two expansions that are currently out. 
What do I like?
I like dice rolling. 
I like the feeling of shopping for monsters and adding them to my collection. 
I like many of the spell and creature power combinations. 
I like everything about this game. 
IF you don't like luck then don't play this game.

RATING: 7
I'll admit it...I don't really like deckbuilders.  Between this being lighter and the excitement of dice rolling, I was willing to enjoy this.

Most importantly, I like that you can shift strategies mid game by culling certain types of dice and then buying up others.  This feels much more tactical as a result.

12/10/11 First play.  Better than I expected.  I had heard bad things and I generally dislike layered chance such as having to draw the right dice and then roll the right number but having played it I did not see it as an issue.  There are no bad dice and the rolls can be significant but with all the rolling it will even out.

Having to check the text on the card makes it not quite as clean as the typical deck building game but the dice are a very nice twist.

RATING: 9
Quarriors! is a game of rolling dice in order to ready creatures for glory, smiting your fellow player's creatures, and recruiting more creatures into your fold.  Taking inspiration from the deck building genre, each player starts the game with an identical bag of 12 dice.  On his turn a player will score glory for any creature he still has in play from his previous turn, then he will randomly draw 6 dice from his bag and roll them.  Each die belongs to a set of dice, easily identified by color, and each set of dice has a corresponding card in the play area describing what each face of the die means.  A die is either a spell, a creature, or currency.  After rolling the dice players have to decide which creatures they rolled they will ready; they can only ready creatures they can pay for out of the currency rolled.  All creatures the player readied will now attack every other player; each player will defend the attack with their readied creatures; some will perish defending their player, and thus will not score.  Finally, the player may recruit one die from the common area with any remaining currency.  Play continues until one player accumulates the necessary glory to win the game!

Quarriors! has a higher luck quotient than its deck building cousins, and the game's combat mechanics are straightforwardly ruthless: you cannot play favorites, nor can you be merciful, you will attack everyone.  The greatest conscious tension in the game is deciding what to do with your rolled dice, as readying a creature will diminish your ability to recruit another creature.  Some creatures are cheap to ready, won't survive most attacks, and score few points, while other creatures cost a premium but will score a handful of points.  The strategy of the game lies in curating the dice in your bag as well as making the best of every situation.

Each game only sees a few sets of dice brought out to play with, the others saved for a future game.  Additionally, each set of dice has more than one card describing its abilities, so future games with the same dice will not always grant the same power, offering a wide array of replay options.  The game plays fast, with little in the way of down time and setup time.  It is heavier on luck than deck building games: you know what dice you will roll, so you know your chances, but you don't know what you will roll.  You may, or may not, get that creature you were hoping for.  This can be both a good and a bad thing, for it levels the playing field allowing a less skilled player to still have a chance to win the game, but a highly skilled player can still lose with a few bad throws of the dice.  Because of this the game should be played in accordance with the theme: have fun, take it lightly, enjoy yourself, and play for the social interaction.

RATING: 7
It takes, once again, the concept of deckbuilding games, but with a sense of originality, exchanging them, in part, with dice. The game is fun, quick and simple. Nevertheless, most decisions seem obvious. Most of the time it feels actually like the game is playing you, and you are just a spectator, but still there is room for picking ad assigning dice with a sense of "strategy" between different choices. As it is as for what it is, it gives a very pleasant time and, with some games under the belt, some "strategies" show up. In the four player format, the game ends not when it is in its climax, but when it hasn't even heated yet. I probably never play it again to less than 20 points this way.

So...yeah, it's really, really random. And it's very similar to Dominion. 

But nearly everyone in my game group owns Dominion, and I'm never going to get my family to play it. "You buy Villages...and Cellars!"

But I can see myself playing LOTS of Quarriors with my sons, and having a blast doing it. Family fun can trump randomness...

(I do think the Dragons are overpowered. WAY overpowered in the case of the Strong one...)

Quarriors is like playing Dominion with a very watered down deck. Like whenever you gain a Kingdom card, you actually gain 3 copies of it, 2 Copper, and a Silver.

The fact that the only real decision you make, which die to add to your 'deck', is undermined by the fact that every time you actually draw that die it's only a 50% chance it'll do it's job is regrettable.

Dominion was ingenious and innovative, but still wasn't a very deep game. Quarriors is less deep and less interesting than Dominion without being any easier to teach, set up, or play.

The most unfortunate thing about Quarriors is because of the nice packaging (and despite the shoddy dice who's info rubs off almost immediately) and the pretty dice, and the fact that it's the first kid on the block to put a new twist on Deck building... it's going to sell a ton and be very popular. Any actual game using the "dice building' mechanism, no matter how much better than Quarriors, will suffer [i]precisely because[/i] it's not as simple or quick as Quarriors.

Game-ending condition is as maligned as it was for Roll Through the Ages. Fun and zany, and what I want in a dice game. Good excuse to roll pretty dice.

Might have been more interesting to get more buys/captures. I've only encountered 1 creature that does that, and it's a late-game one.

[thread=690766]Posted a review.[/thread]

I don't like "sandbox/toolbox" games, as the designers are happy to admit. That usually speaks of weak, non-unique game design.

A little turned off by "first (to buy and draw and roll) dragon wins!"

This one is just as good as I expected.  Adds the fun of dice with the deck-building mechanic.  It's fun to roll the dice and see what could have been and what you ended up with.  I'm a big fan of games that force you to adapt your strategy on the fly.  Another big plus of this one is the speed.  I'd say it's over too quickly in the 4p game.  Three players definitely seems to be the sweet spot.  I can see the gripes about the writing on the dice being too small or the bags being too tight, but those are minor issues for this super-fun game.  My only personal issue is that with 4 the game seems too short.

After sitting back and thinking about this, I'd have to say that the idea of this game is sound, but the implementation might not come off in a way that gamers will like.  I like randomness in games when it causes you to adapt your plan to overcome it.  This game seems like sheer randomness is all you get.  Downgraded to a 7 and on the For Trade list.

Must be played with 2 rules from the expansion. 

Fluffy to the point of being more of a novelty than a game, the expansion rules make it a bit more gamerish, but still not above a curiosity you don't have to play more than once. The main idea is that this is sort of deck building with dice. Main problem is that pure luck has more influence on the game than any decisions. I mean the idea is cute, but there are better deck builders with this theme (Thunderstone, even Nightfall) and there are better dice games with attacking out there (King of Tokyo). Might be a neat game for geeky children? 

Rating down to 1.0 because: fluffy but gamey. Just make fluffy games that are actually fun [loud].

I played a 4P game with the Rise of the Demons expansion and was a little underwhelmed by it without really knowing why. That game featured a few cards that couldn't be used to their full effect and so there weren't many cards that could be bought. 

A year and a half later, I revisited the base game in two 3P games and felt even more underwhelmed by it. In most deckbuilders, you can get nerfed by a bad draw. In Quarriors!, you can get nerfed by a bad draw [i]and[/i] a bad roll, which makes the game too random for me to appreciate. You don't get a lot of options either - you roll your dice, and then you decide what you can do with your roll. Those choices are often limited, because you'd just want to summon any creatures rolled and buy something with any leftover money. The combination of the lack of decision space, coupled with the continuous drawing and rolling of dice gets repetitive quickly, even within the first game.

The components look lovely (good luck squinting at the dice though) and the mechanism of dice replacing cards in a deckbuilder is clever. It's a shame that the rest of the game doesn't live up to the premise.

Inventive game. Associates dice of different colors with different cards. So based on rolling a bunch of dice, you can use variable powers based on the cards they are associated with. Too many dice though!

Deck Building, Dice. I enjoyed this one - the play wasn't complicated, it's always fun rolling dice (or collecting them for that matter). I like how the use of cards + dice makes it easy to expand/change the dice available. Not 100% sold on the victory condition -- in my only play, it felt like a race to get a dragon out for scoring, and the rest of the dice you bought really didn't matter too much.

I'd like to play more, but don't see myself ever owning this.

Update: played this twice more and it felt a lot better, so maybe my first play was a little flat with the dragon and promos in it. It was pretty fun and I could see myself owning this eventually.

UPDATE: heh, 40 plays and 2 expansions later, I'm still digging this. Good lunch game, too, the guys all like it. We did make up our own set of variants and printed them on cards, similar to what some other people have done. We draw 2 random rule changes at the start of each game.

Didn't like this at first, but I'm warming to it a bit. It's like Dominion would be if your good cards often turned into pretty much worthless copper when you draw them - pretty frustrating.

I've had games where I've bought loads of good dice, trashed my crappy ones as much as I could and proceeded to just roll Quiddity THE WHOLE TIME.

And that's another thing - the whole Q thing is annoying, and makes the game more difficult to learn. Why not call it "mana" or something that makes sense? Better terminology would make everything much more intuitive.

But the dice are cool, and when they aren't dicking you over it's fun to play.

Örülök, hogy kipróbálhattam a kockás Dominiont. Igazából mindig 6 kockát dobunk a körünkben és gyűjtjük a jobbnál jobbakat, közben pedig szörnyeket idézünk, akiknek a következő körünkig életben kell maradniuk, a többiek támadásait kivédve. Nagyon egyszerű, nagyon változatos és picit sem akar komolynak látszani. 4-en talán kicsit lehet lassú, bár szerintem nem vészes, de igazi partyjáték. Egyértelműen tetszett, bármikor kategória.

RATING: 5
Heard and read a lot of negative things about this game from trusted gamers and geekbuddies, so I never sought out to try it. Plus most deck builders I've played are not exactly the most sublime design, so there were some biases going in.

What I found on first play was more strategy and tactics than I had heard there would be. But the game was kinda boring with 4 players. And adding an extra layer of luck onto deck builders is not something the genre needed, I think.

Perhaps consider it as a dice game, and not a deck-building game, fine. But it fails there because there is no excitement. The literal purpose of dice is to create excitement, and this game does not really do that. There's some small tension in hoping your opponents don't roll what they need to kill your monster, but it does not justify the hundreds of dice or whatever that this game comes with.

As a gamer's game, in the long-run, I think Puzzle Strike mops the floor with this when it's evaluated as a deck building game, and King of Tokyo devours it as a quick dice filler game.

Despite the lightness I wouldn't feel comfortable playing it with non-gamers or anything either because the dice can be hard to read, etc.

The game was more fun than I'd heard, though.

RATING: 2
When described, this game sounds perfect.  I love the idea of how the dice are used for different monster cards.  I love the special powers.  I love the use of the bag rather than shuffling cards.  The idea of direct interaction is refreshing. 

But man, this was miserable. The big selling factor in the game is that it is supposed to be a quick filler.  But after playing an hour and 45 minute three player game, where no one could make any traction to finish the damn thing, I got to see how there aren't really any real choices to be had.  It was awesome to finish with zero points and the other players saying how nothing I could have done would have made any difference.

When you get behind the curve, your bag is filled with crap dice, this means that you aren't likely to get a couple monsters out to have one or two of them able to soak up hits.  Instead, you can just throw your monster to the wolves and repeat this over and over again.

All the decision with what to do with your dice are pretty straight forward, so the majority of your "decision making" is to roll well.  If you keep rolling ones, you just aren't as good at this game as those that are able to roll a couple monsters and high money.

My initial impression after a single play was that I really am not interested in playing this again.  My buddies seem to like it and will probably try to convince me to give it another try & i probably will ... 

Despite the fact that I enjoy dice-rolling and I enjoy some randomness in my games, this game felt very simplistic and very boring ... I am a fan of the deck-building genre for the most part and while this is certainly not card driven, the mechanic is clearly that of a "deck building" game only it falls far short of anything novel or interesting (except it uses dice) for me ...

I tried it again last night with some expansions apparently.  We played 3 games - and I actually enjoyed the first 2 games which were fast and light.  In the 3rd game it dragged and it felt like it would never end - the "lock" mechanism did not grab me at all and felt more a gimmick than something that developed the game ni a meaningful way.  

I cannot place my finger yet on why this game does not work for me but I will give it another try - if only to figure out why i dislike it !

Fall 2013

After purchasing this game and playing dozens of times with my son and my nephew (who absolutely loves this game) i have come to appreciate it more.  If played as a short game of light fun then it begins to shine and in fact now I will start to look for more of the expansions ...

Way, way too random to be a good deckbuilding-type game, and a bit too dry to be a great filler dice game.

I really want to like Quarriors, but there's just something lacking from the game.  I like the concept of dice-building, but the game is so random (you randomly select dice, and then you have to roll them) that there's little strategy.  Seems like it just boils down to "buy the most powerful creature, and then hope you get to summon it."  

My friends seem to like it, so we'll try out different variants/expansions to see if that adds anything.  As it is, I'd rather just play Dominion or King of Tokyo.

A dicefest with just enough strategy to be interesting. It effectively has the "deckbuilding" element, as you are working toward increasing the number of dice that you get to use and cycling through them. I appreciate that it plays quickly, as it would likely drag on otherwise.

UPDATE: I'd like to play this again, but the set of creatures that we had, once someone had a lead, they were pretty much impossible to beat.

UPDATE #2: I actually think that with the correct rules, this is a pretty entertaining game.

A refreshing addition to the deck-building genre. There is a large element of luck and randomness involved, but this is to be expected with so many dice involved. I approached this game as if it were a light, slightly brain-dead, entertaining filler and it did not disappoint. 

I recommend the variant: Players may buy up to 2 dice per buy phase (instead of 1). This gives players more of a choice.

I seem to fall into the realm of how almost everybody else on BGG feels about this game.  I bought it because it seemed like a fun concept; "Dominion with dice?   I love Dominion and I love rolling dice!"  But once I played it, it was just a little too simple and on-rails for me.  What everyone else says about it is exactly right.  The first player to buy the biggest creature wins the game.  The one thing that it does have going for it is that it is a quick game that people can play in about 20 minutes while waiting for others to show up.

I've always sucked at games that were mostly luck based, for some reason the RNGesus hates me and does not like it when I roll the things I want to roll.  I don't think 3-4 games can possibly give me an idea of how random this game is but for right now I'm not doing so well.  Part of this could have been horrible strategy on my part but the other part was rolling exactly what I dont want like all money and no creatures to drop to help cull my deck and score points.  

I'm definitely up for a few more games to see how much the luck aspect plays into the game but I don't think I'll buy it for my wife and I to play.

I honestly don't know what to think of this one. There are some truly brilliant ideas going on within the game, and the production value is absolutely top notch. That said, I'm not sure whether the game is just a chase to catch up with the leader at this point... I would like to play it multiplayer before I form a firm opinion on the subject (we played three two player games).

Upon further reflection, I think that the main issue with the game is timing. The powers are simply too powerful for the brief period of time played if using the "automatic victory point" levels. For example, in a three player game, reaching fifteen points could very well take ten minutes or less if the right players get the right dice in combination.

I love the game, but don't expect deep or complicated game play.  This is light, (relatively) quick and straightforward game play.

This is a lot of fun!  It's not deep or strategic, or even all that tactical, but the cards and dice are cute, you can get some interesting combos if your luck holds out, and it's over too quickly to outstay its welcome.  Best of all, Ren likes it!

Pretty quick game, and pretty fun.  I though the dragon is vastly overpowered and/or undervalued.  Should be nerfed or at least make it cost 10 or something.
Also thought the game could be a tick longer so luck had a little more chance to even out.  

Pretty fun, I want to see WAY more variations in the creature cards, though, and maybe a few more dice as well.  But more cards with varying powers and stats for the current dice for sure.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nice variation on the deck-building theme, and sufficiently solves the problem endemic to deck-builders--when equally skilled players play, the luckiest shuffle wins (there is zero skill involved, literally).  There is additional luck inserted into the system at the dice roll part--with the expert rules from the expansion--this luck inserts tactical decisions into the system.  Yes, it is possible to have repeated sub-optimal rolls, but a game-long string of them is highly unlikely.

Good theme play.  Easy to learn and play, good gateway game.  New twist to the deck building type games. Game isn't too deep, and luck is a large part of the game.

Game time is too short at about 30 minutes because your 'deck' just gets rolling and the game ends.

RATING: 5
I see the similarities with deckbuilding card games and appreciate an attempt to shake up that model. However, this game just doesn't seem to work. Way too easy for a lucky roll or two to make one player untouchable and give him/her a runaway victory.

True example of a 4-player game: Player 1 has a dragon out. Player 2 rolls his dice. Player 1 declares: "Player 2, your dragon came up as a tear drop (money), so you can't touch my dragon. Player 3, your dragon's in the discard pile and you have dice in your bag so you can't roll it on your turn. Player 4, you don't have anything that can beat my dragon. So I win!" Phooey. That wouldn't be so bad if it didn't happen on like turn 6, where we had barely played anything.

Still, many people seem to love it because it's fast and hey, lots of dice! To each their own. I'd play it in the right situation, mostly to be polite and sociable, but I'm not going to suggest it.

Really like the concept, but execution is a bit lacking. Game feels a bit flat and too luck driven.

I had fun playing Quarriors - 4 games.  This "Dominion with Dice" plays fast and presents high quality and attractive bits (cards and dice) that combine to present the illusion of strategy and fairly limited tactical choices.  It's too light, too repetitive, and a bit too derivative.  But I'd play it again.  Seems like 2011 is the year of the Dominion clone.   

Dragons may be overpowered, which, if true, gives it a little more strategy at least.

My son really likes this game.  The game has a cool vibe, but it is too random for me.  When I buy one of the strong die and it comes up only as quidity three times in a row it's annoying.

So...I have decided to approach this game the same way I do when I play Candy Land with my younger daughter. Put a smile on my face and enjoy spending time with my kids and stop thinking about the mechanics.

Update
My son has not asked to play in a long time, but our just turned 6 year old daughter was interested a month ago.  Just like with Carcassonne (a game I didn't really like until I started playing with her) I have really started to like playing this game.  There isn't much depth to it and we play with some of the advanced rules, but it's fun to role dice and my daughter likes the different creatures.

It's all dice, so randomness rules the game. I've had a few play throughs that go way too quickly with people getting lucky, but when the game goes deep, it can get really exciting. The dice are beautiful. A few of mine seemed to have difficulty in printing and you have to squint to see what you just rolled, but that's not a game breaker at all. The cards are very well laid out with fun art. The game has a limit to spells and monsters per game, which makes it easy to create a plan and see where your opponents may be going. Ultimately; tons and tons of fun if you can get down with the random.

RATING: 6
Fun and addictive, despite being almost mindless. Combat is very well done. Dice are lovely, and the creature variety is nice. Game is over a bit too fast. Die balance seems "off". There's little incentive to buy cheap dice; currently feels like pricing based on Dominion without understanding the differences in this gameplay.

House Rules:

First, what a great idea! Second, I love dice games.  This is a dice bag builder (not a deck builder).  No tedious shuffling.  Fast because it's dice.

Now, it's complicated at first.  Once you have the mechanics down it is much easier and faster to play.  I found a player "mat" online that I printed out and it was perfect for us beginners.  Note, when your dice bag is empty, add all the used dice back into the bag and finish drawing up to 6 dice during the draw phase.  All 10 pages in the instructions and it's in one little spot that I missed, (FYI).

Dominion invented the genre of deckbuilding and many others have taken the idea and twisted it.  I've played almost all of them, but none of them are as much fun as Quarriors.  This game is pure fun.  There's not a lot of meaningful decisions, but there are lots of decisions.  It seems like a lot of the dice are about the same power level which means that they'll all be generally useful.  This avoids one of my big problems with Dominion.

I'm really looking forward to more plays of Quarriors.  I've started my rating at 7, but I think this will go up a lot.  I'm trying to be cautious with this one because I love the fun factor.  I don't want to set myself up for failure with this one.

I love dominion, but quarriors didn't wow me.  I disliked the additional layer of luck.  Ie. after you drew a good hand you could still roll badly.  I can say at least it was quick.  The dice/card combo mechanics are really neat and I think the game is really clever.

Verdict.  Will play but won't shell out cash for it. 2011/09/11

Played this at Essen 2012. Quite a boring game. Roll, buy a dice, roll more, hope you roll a big creature, hit. Yay!

See absolutely no reason to get this.

I bought it in the original tin when it was being discontinued, so bought the last one at a FLGS for discount.

I do love this game.  I also downloaded cards on here by a BGG'er that plays Harry Potter.  Lots of fun and easier to play with new people, as they can understand the characters and spells better.

You have to really love rolling dice to get into this. For me it is too long with not enough choices to make me want to play this again. also the swinginess of the dice might be OK if their were alot of die rolls to minimize this, but early luck can be a real game breaker in this; also the fact you dont really get all that many turns in a game, maybe what 7?

I actually like the theme on Quarriors best for this style of game. I feel there is a real disconnect in theme no matter how hard they try for Dice masters. You get no rotation of art its only effects. So having the Qwirky nonsensical theme of Quarriors for a game that has a tough time with theme shining through the mechanics just feels more fun... If that makes sense...

RATING: 7.5
Quarriors at face value is a very fun game.  It is super simple and super quick...perhaps too much so.  I found there to be little dice "building" in this dice building game.  You just grab what you can and roll.  Unlike other deck building games, where you are working towards creating a finely tuned deck.  Quarriors is over before things get started.

This doesn't mean it isn't fun.  Rolling the dice is fun!  I just think it needs some house rules to be better :)  And house ruling this game should be super easy.

Update 9/18/2011: After playing a couple games with additional rules, I think this game earned it's rating I've giving.  It could be a potential 8 with the changes I played with.  Two rules we used are: Play to 20 points and play with 1 of each spell and creature.  We also used a modified "assistant" variant rule found on this forum which I enjoyed a lot.

Entertaining.  I probably won't pick it up, as it feels a little redundant with the deck building games I have.  But I'd likely play it if someone else wanted to.

Kockás dominion, ahol "laphúzás" után még meg is kell dobni azt, amit szeretnél használni. Ráadásul a pontszerzésre a köröd végén kint hagyott kocka-kártyádat minden ellenfeled megtámadja egyszer a saját körében és csak akkor kapsz érte pontot, ha életben marad.

A többiek szemmel láthatóan élvezték a játékot, de nekem a szürnyes-trollos téma miatt kimondottan taszító volt. Ráadásul ezt a Gosus-franciás grafikát kimondottan utálom.

Van benne mana, ami nem ugyanaz mint a bibliai manna. A kocka-kártyákat nem kijátszod, hanem megidézed. És ehhez a számommra taszító témához jön még a rengeteg kockadobálás.

Szóval nagyon nem tetszett a játék, mert minden olyan dolog benne van, amit én nem kedvelek egy játékban. És hiába a Dominion-os alap, a Thunderstone-al ellentétben ez már nekem túl van az ingerküszöbömön.

While somewhat hyped as Dominion with dice, I thought Q missed the mark in several respects. First, the game concept is not the simple, "Take an action and buy something," while the game doesn't have the depth of "engine" construction of Dominion. (For example, in a Dominion game just after Q, I used doubled King's Courts to activate Envoys to draw nearly my entire deck, not only letting me access additional actions, buys and treasures, but also powering Horn of Plenty.) Q is just set the warriors up and see if they survive, with complexity but not depth. The dice make the warriors unreliable, sometimes just turning into money. The explanation cards for the different dice can be hard to see (as are some dice faces), and they're far more complex than Dominion cards, even though they end up providing a rather simplistic experience.

Quarriors is interesting for its bag-building mechanic, but I think that a game with this much direct player interaction ought to have more determinism. It also seems that regardless of the spread of available dice, only a few types ever get purchased. (This is exacerbated by the rather low supply of dice of each type; if your opponent is buying anything remotely good you better get in on it before all five? of them are gone!)

I think Quarriors probably got stronger when it got reimplemented as Marvel/D&D Dice Masters, but those incarnations have their own problems of being collect-em-alls on top of the fact that the game mechanics here just aren't that interesting to me.

Rating after 5 plays. The dice and cards are completely unbalanced, there's very little room for varying strategies (if "be first player" can be considered a strategy), and the element of random chance is huge. Nevertheless, I love this Dominion-meets-Yahtzee game! Maybe it's the rolling handfuls of cool dice. Maybe its.... well, no, it's the rolling handfuls of cool dice. And I completely disagree with people who want the game to be longer; any longer and my rating would drop. It's the perfect length for what it does.

Comments on just the base game:
Deck builder with dice that is MUCH faster to setup, play and tear down. Its almost a meaty filler. Of course, its a dice game, so there is luck involved - more so than normal deck builders. Still, good quick fun. 

Couple minor quibbles: Like a lot of games, not all the options are interesting, but it seems like there is much more of that here. A lot of the cards are just not balanced properly for cost making it such that you'd never buy them. Others are must buys and low costs and disappear immediately. This doesn't make it un-fun, but it does make a good portion of the options a waste.

I don't mind dice rolling as a mechanic, but there just doesn't feel like there's a lot of meat on the bone of this game. There didn't seem to be a ton of strategy for me here; just buy the best die you can afford and pray you roll as many creatures as possible. Shame, because I love all the custom dice. Was ready to trade after just one play though.

Quarriors has received some very mixed reviews, but I have to give the designers credit ... a deck-building game with dice is a very cool idea. Admittedly, though, I am a sucker for anything with specialty dice. As for the game itself, I want to like it more than I do. The decisions aren't really challenging - buy what you can afford - and there are definitely balance issues, including the much-debated start player/culling advantage. I have at least some home that future expansions will bring more options and balance to the game. For now, though, it's a pleasant way to while away the time - I definitely like rolling dice better than shuffling cards!

What a delightful because lighthearted adaption of Dominion. Great optics, cute and at the same time cool artwork. When all set up, the dice on the table lead one to believe to just have entered a candy shop (not in the 50 Cent kind of way) The game can be a bit swingy, but as it moves very fast, it's not too bad, if you're being smoked once or twice. We got in 4 sessions in two hours including rules explanation. Don't agree with the statement there are only obvious choices and no decisions to be made.

I'd say it's not quite a 7, but not as low as a 6 (using the BGG scale).  There really is not much to this game, much less so than any other deck building game I have played.  I like it quite a bit though.  It really could go as a slightly meatier filler if the setup was not so long.

UPDATE:  Well, after a few more plays, a few more thoughts materialized.  It is really a very vanilla game, with not much at all going on.  There is a slight bit of strategy there, but the real joy of the game is pulling a handful of dice out of the bag and rolling them.  That is really all there is to it.  I like it quite a bit, though.

Quarriors is a fun take on the deckbuilder, but the original Quarriors is poorly balanced and usually leaves us feeling unsatisfied. In Dominion, you can pick a strategy and combine cards in interesting ways. In Quarriors, due to all the random dice rolls, the short game length, and the mechanics that frankly just needed more playtesting, it's just really unlikely to ever get interesting combos. In practice you just always purchase the biggest monster you can, and hope to roll it. Runaway victories are common.

Official variants and house rules try to add more depth to the game, but these all have downsides since the game wasn't balanced around them, and at some point you have to realize the fundamentals just aren't there.

Also, the dice are small and hard to read.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
See the "advanced rules" in the variants section. 

http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/711697/dr-houserule-or-how-i-made-some-minor-changes-to

It changes Quarriors from a light, quick, filler, with heavy amounts of luck, random set up, and fun dice chuckin to a light, quick, filler, with heavy amounts of luck, random set up, fun dice chucking AND more meaningful decisions.  Truth be told, if you didn't like Quarriors this variant won't change it, but if you thought it was okay with potential this may fix it for you.

My rating and my games played from my 5th play on reflect it in that fashion.

From game 9 on, we have played to 25 for 2 player games.  Again, its an easy recommend, as it help creates the dice building feeling that is somewhat lost with the score = cull variant I prefer.

The game as published is a 6 or 7.

My expectations were too high for Quarriors. Handling the dice did not turn out to be any easier than handling the cards in a deckbuilding game, mainly because the dice are a bit more difficult to count and remove from the too-small bag. This almost negates their advantage of not having to be shuffled. Also, the overall play seemed a bit too simple/shallow. That being said, it is enjoyable to play, so I likely won't turn down opportunities to do so.

Nice dice! Unfortunately, the rules make 3 and 4 player games last way too long. I think monsters attacking should use up attack hits as they go around the table, making it harder to kill off opponent's monsters further around the table. It is a really great 2 player game (you have to have a monster stronger than the other player to survive each round.) It's way too hard to score with more than 2 players. Eventually somebody wins, but by that time you just want to play something else. Rules should be changed to make it harder to kill off other players monsters too easily. It is a cool game, nice dice, but needs some rules tweaking.

Quarriors! is a very fun game and is quite similar in game play to Dominion and Nightfall.  

You roll your dice and use the result to either put out creatures or buy another die.  The choices you make are not arbitrary, and every bit as interesting as they are in Dominion, except for the fact that Quarriors does not have the combo synergy yet that Dominion has.

I like having the creatures in play and the special abilities that come up if you roll stars on the die.  I like the fact that your creatures automatically attack each player when they come into play.  No one feels "picked on" like you do when you play Nightfall.  The downside is that there are fewer attacking choices with creatures.  But you can single out a player's creatures for individual smack down by using the spell dice.  Some of them,like the purple one, let you kill any one creature in play if certain conditions are met.

People who whine about this game "playing itself" or being too luck oriented probably just like to whine, or hate dice games.  If you hate dice games as a genre don't review this game.

RATING: 5
It's pleasant, but doesn't seem to have much to it. There are probably interesting combinations that can be set up, but there clearly aren't nearly as many as in Dominion, since we had none in our selection of dice. (Not to mention that even if you draw the combination dice at the same time, you might not roll the correct faces.) This, combined with the fact that you can only buy one die a turn, means that there is generally no reason not to buy the biggest thing you can afford. I like to have a FEW interesting decisions in a game.

RATING: 5
Rating after two plays with three and four players. The cards and dice are beautiful to behold, but the first time it took longer to read and understand the cards than it took to play the game. After throwing the dice maybe four or five times we already had a winner! A little dissatisfying somehow. Our second play was better, but the randomness of it all still left a bitter taste in my mouth. Not a bad game, but not one that I would like to play again. I generally like deckbuilding games better.

Too many dice! I don't mind tossing a lot of dice during a game (e.g. X-Wing), but building a bag of dice just doesn't provide a rich enough experience for me. Prefer dice masters if playing a dice builder.

RATING: 6
Very interesting, but ultimately pretty light. I really dig the whole "Dominion but with Dice" aesthetic, but the extra layer of randomness due to the dice roll really does make it a complete crap shoot at times. As long as one doesn't mind the occasional swingy game, it's not a bad little diversion.

Quite easy and casual dice version of Dominion typish game. The game felt very random, actually even so that probably most of the strategy and nyances get really buried under the random nature of the game. But dice rolling is always fun, it is easy and fast to play and the custom dice are simply cool, so I have to give some points for those :)

Obviously not a tenth of the strategy or replayability of Dominion, but fun all the same.

One concern: I worry that the way they handled the "culling" mechanic unnecessarily introduces a rich-get-richer dynamic to the game.  I wonder if it'd be better if everyone got to just cull one die each time they reshuffled instead.

It's a hyped deck-builder, but really, I'd rather just play Dominion with poker chips. I think the main mechanic that's annoying is that your "creatures"-- or how you win-- don't pop up when you need them to, meaning that the game boils down to not only drawing the perfect dice (a la any deckbuilder), but also hoping that you roll them at least reasonably well. The extra layer of luck makes it less satisfactory.

I was on the fence the first time through, but I like this game more the more I play it. Added a house rule to allow players to purchase up to 1 creature and 1 spell (if they can afford it) at a time, and usually increase the points goal to prolong playtime, since part of the issue we found was that the game was ending right around the time you get a feel for your deck.

Edit: I've upped my rating from an 8 to a 9.  The expert rules along with the variety of dice the expansions bring have made this a better game over time.

RATING: 6
I really want to like this game more than I do.  I love dice and the idea of a dice building just makes me happy on the inside, but this games one major drawback is there is so little player interaction.

I love buying dice, I love playing dice, and I love drawing dice, but once your turn is over you're basically sitting there waiting for your turn again.  Things do happen to you but there's so little that you can actually do about it.

The game also has the problem with having a really slow start and then finishing before you even realize it.  The slow start comes from every player having the same 12 starting dice so they pretty much have the same first 2 turns.  Nothing really interesting happens, people just buy dice and then pass.  There are many house rules to fix this problem, my group usually gives so many points that so that players can buy dice before the game starts.

Just when the game starts to get interesting, the game ends (unless you're playing 4 players).  If you're playing with less than 4 players, the game ends at a really low number of points and we usually just play to 20 as if we were playing a 4 player game.

Despite the complaints, I like this game.  It's not something I want to bring out all the time but just the idea of picking and rolling dice is fun, even if waiting for your turn isn't fun.  It's not something I would recommend to everybody or even tell someone to rush out to buy, but it's a fun game.

RATING: 6.3
A fun little game. Has some gameplay issues - most noticeable is a slippery slope with the cull mechanic where once you score, your dice get more efficient and you end up getting quite a significant advantage. However, the dice rolls can be so random that this is kind of overshadowed. There's strategy here, but it's coated in a thick layer of randomization, so be warned: don't take this one too seriously!

Some cards are pretty overpowered and while it's nice that this makes some layouts have a certain strategy to them, it also kind of makes it obvious and boring (most noticeable are the Mighty Defender of the Pale and some Quake Dragon/Growth combos). Spells aside from Growth in general seem underwhelming and bland and are rarely bought.

Dice quality is rather bad (the numbers are near unreadable on some die), but I guess this is fixed in expansions, and will also be fixed in a new version of the base set to come, so that's great!

Pro-tip for dice storage: don't use the little baggies they come in, just toss them in one big bag. It may make less sense at the time but it ends up being so much faster and easier to set this game up than fiddling with lots of baggies.

RATING: 5.5
Neat enough at first blush, and feels like a fairly good implementation of dice as the core component in a deck-building game.  However, there's a huge amount of swingyness in the luck of the draw PLUS the luck of the rolls, especially with the rather small scores you play to (but of course, higher scores would make the game last far too long).

This is a bit of a copy cat of dominion. Except instead of deck building, you are dice building. In my opinion that definitely makes it better. It's a simple to learn game with great components and you can come out with different sets of monsters each time to add replayability. I can't wait to play this more, especially with some of the expansions.

It's a great concept, and luck seems to average out, however I didn't really feel like I was doing much dice-building. During the 2 games I played I only ended up buying 5 dice at end game. I didn't feel like I had really built much of a strategy since 12/17 dice were the starting set.

Maybe extending the game would have fixed this, but there didn't seem to be much more to the game to merit extending the game anyway.

Fun game for what it is. Building your "deck" of dice and rolling and making decisions about what to summon and what to play is fun.

I'd somewhat worry that the only real decisions that are made in the game is what to buy. However, that's the case with dominion as well....

Extra randomness of what dice you pull and how you roll them makes the game quite, well... random.

I'm pretty spoiled by deck-building games at this point.  They've been coming out so frequently that it's absurd.  Quarriors definitely had something that caught my eye, which is to say, it had dice.  That was neat enough that I definitely wanted to try it out.  Sadly, there's just not enough strategy or length here to make it worthwhile.  The game seems to end just as it gets going.  The three- and four-player game end ridiculously early.  There's not really any non-obvious choices.  If you can summon a creature, you almost always want to do so, because it thins your deck AND gets you VPs AND hurts the other players.  Rarely is keeping the money worth it, as it's just a wasted die otherwise.

Game has some good ideas in but really lacks of long term strategy as it's all about good luck with dices... even if you play for more points (with 4 players you almost have no time to use your choices) game still doesn't manage to let you "plan" your strategy.

PERMANENT PLACE IN COLLECTION

UPDATED: With Quartifacts and the advanced culling rules, Quarriors is now a proper strategic deck builder with opportunities for re-rolling, attack, defense, boosts, etc. It's obviously still luck-based and has the possibility for unlucky rolls and mega-turns, but I don't mind that. It's genuinely very very fun with two.

UPDATED: Rating keeps creeping up. Quarriors ain't Dominion. It's more like King of Tokyo or Zombie Dice. It's random and very very silly. However, it's become our 'to-go' daft dice game and gets played a lot despite being objectively not very good. The McDonalds of games, perhaps. 

UPDATE: Upgraded from 6.5 to 8 with the new Quarmageddon rules. A quick light game with oodles of custom dice and cartoon monsters. What's there not to like... 

Fun filler with dice. Gets better with the Demons expansion and I'm looking forward to more expansions. 

A bit samey with the base game alone, but it's quite fun.

Deck-building meets dice?  Sign me up!  It's about what you would expect from something described that way (you get an additional vector of randomness due to the roll of the dice you draw), but the same principles that apply to other deck-building games -- streamlining, building up currency before turning to points, having dice that interact well with each other -- apply here, and so long as folks enjoy playing with dice, I don't think they'll have a problem with the game.  I can see some potential issues, but they're not enough to turn me away from the novelty of the game.

UPDATE: I'm only two plays in, but so far, I'm not sure that this game has a lasting appeal.  The attrition rate of the game seems very slow for a deck-builder, partly because you don't ever have a guarantee of getting the ride side of the die you buy.  It's bad enough that you only see certain dice a few times through a "deck," but when you don't even get to use it for why you bought it, it's frustrating, and guaranteed to ensure a loss.  I'm not quite ready to give up on it, but it's starting to lose some of its shine, even at such a small number of plays.

In Quarriors, each player plays as a Quarrior competing for Glory in the eyes of Quiana, the Empress of Quaridia. Each player starts with an identical set of 12 dice in their dice bag. At the start of the game, Creature and Spell dice (Quarry) are dealt at random to form "the Wilds" in the center of the table. As play progresses, players roll their dice to attempt to summon Creatures, cast Spells, and harness the magical power of Quiddity (the in-game resource) to capture Quarry from the Wilds to add to their repertoire and into their dice bag. Players draw and roll 6 dice a turn from their bag, making that controlling bag composition is key to victory.
\13\\13\
Quarriors is a fast-paced game where players must strategically balance their choices each turn. Do I use my Quiddity to summon Creatures in the hopes of scoring Glory or should I spend it all to capture more powerful Quarry from the Wilds? Players must outmaneuver their opponent's through strategic Spell use, the acquisition of powerful Quarry, and ultimately, by striking down opponent's Creature in combat. If your Creatures survive until your next turn, you will score Glory points and move closer to victory!

It's a fantastic idea to take the concept of a deckbuilding game and switch out the cards by a shitload of custom dice. Only for this the game should be applauded already. So it is even more appealing since the game itself is really fun and plays very fluently. a quick 2 player game can play out in less than 15 minutes, making it an excellent filler game.
Besides, I can't stress enough how cool it is to roll so many different dice every turn.

Quarriors! has completely ambushed me. I demoed it at Gen Con and came away mostly ambivalent about it. I enjoyed my game, but I didn't feel like it had enough to offer as a strategy game. Fast forward a few months later. I found an abandoned pre-order copy at the local FLGS being offered for less than even online pricing. I went ahead and picked it up on a whim, thinking that I didn't hate my one play at Gen Con and that the kids might like it...and do they ever! The game has been a hit, even with the kids that aren't really into gaming. The X-factor here seems to be the combat system, which generally speaking, doesn't allow one player to pick on another. The whole table has to take the hit from every creature that's played. That this even matters might seem silly, but trust me, that little design decision makes for an incredibly peaceful family game session.

As you've probably read a hundred times by now, there is a ton of luck and a runaway leader problem. (Probably due to that non-targeted aggression.) The game plays so fast though, that it doesn't really make sitting through a bad game all that painful. There are a few variants from the designer floating around to address some of the complaints, but I'm not really sold on them. Culling only the dice that score makes the dice bag feel stagnant and removes the feel of "deck building". While buying multiple dice per turn makes the game end too quickly via the four empty pile rule. I think maybe the best fix is to just raise the Glory Point target. That would give everyone's dice bag time to develop and maybe some of these problems might take care of themselves...

I rate this a 5 with the rules as written. But using the "designer's house rules", the game is much better. It is really annoying, however, to discuss at the beginning of each game how these house rules apply to characters whose abilities relate to culling.

The dice quality of the expansions is better than in the base game. I stopped after two expansions since they weren't really adding any new depth to the game.

My dad really likes Quarriors and I'm always happy to play it with him when we're together. But overall, I think the game is a disappointment. I love dice games and fell in love with the concept from the very first picture on BGG (I was the game's first comment!). But the whole thing just feels kind of sloppy.

Quarriors! is a surprisingly entertaining dice game that almost reminds me of Magic: the Gathering in some ways. Like Magic, I think Quarriors! is at its best and most strategic with 2 players and more than that just tends to devolve the experience into chaotic tug-of-war.

I like the variety of spells and creatures, which means games will often be different based on the combination of dice available for purchase. It is a DICE game, so complaining about an element of randomness is a bit silly. Again, the game feels like it manages this randomness best in a 2-player game, where watching your opponent's choices and developing a counter-strategy is crucial and will win you games. With 3 to 4 players, I can agree that the chaos will tend to take over.

I enjoyed Quarriors! quite a bit and certainly recommend it to people who aren't afraid of rolling dice. The production quality is great and the gameplay is good fun.

The first "dice building game" this one comes across as a little fiddly at first but once you get the hang of it the game flows pretty well.

Unsure on the replay-ability on this one but I'm sure printing some new cards would yield plenty of room for expansions.

RATING: 6
this game was magical for the first couple sessions.
the idea of a deck builder that you don't have to shuffle is marvelous.

unfortunately, the top end dice are just too strong, and affect too much of the game.

getting an early dragon is just game over for the other players.

perhaps the expansions fix this, because the game mechanics are pretty good.
it is a surprisingly hard game to teach for how simple it is, because the rules have these little fiddly bits in them.

I've played this game 20+ times on iOS alone and now once on iOS with a co-worker. When the game was first released I had pre-ordered it, but backed out when the pre-release talk said it wasn't that great of a game. Having played it on iOS now, I'd say it was probably unwarranted—there is some strategy here and it is [i]somewhat[/i] interesting, however the setup of the game (placing out the dice and the cards, reading over the cards, getting the base setup of dice) would probably turn me off from buying the game.

I'm happy to play it on iOS from time to time, but it won't be a game that I'll buy the physical version of.

This game leaves me wanting for something a little more in the rules. It feels like they are on to something really awesome, but it isn't quite right. I've found the 2 rule changes helps a lot, but I find it rare that I ever want to purchase 3 out of the draw and the cheap creatures and spells are only so good. The game never lasts that long where you can build that much. I enjoy it for filler.

I quite like Quarriors. It is fast, interesting, and despite the 'randomness' of throwing the dice, I feel like I can direct the flow of fortune with the decisions I make none the less.

I like deckbuilding games, so this 'dice-building' game has that appeal instantly. But along with that, I enjoy the variety of spells and dice-types that I have to choose from, the characters are fantasy oriented in a cute and sometimes funny way, and either the game moves relatively quickly, or it just feels that way. 

I look forward to playing the later expansions to Quarriors. It is a simple, colorful, whimsicle game to play against a willing opponent.

It's like trying to go to bed at 4 o'clock in the afternoon.  Not much happens, and you wonder why you aren't doing something else.

You may also wonder why you're covered in pudding, but that's a different story altogether.

[i]Update:[/i]

After further plays, the attack mechanics and dice-building/dice-chucking systems have grown on me. What's not to like, at least occasionally.

We always use the variant of being able to purchase two dice (both different) instead of just one, since this greatly improves the game.  We also increase the number of empty monster cards needed to end the game, otherwise the game finishes too quickly.

It is a nice attempt at a new deck building game but it does not work as written. With only 1 buy/round, you should buy the most expensive thing you can. The other option is to take the best defensive creature. Whether your creature lives is based on luck of the other players. Also, there is no sure thing that any creature bought will ever show up. The various creatures of the same color are to similar. Random, random, random...

Good alternative to any deck building games. Must like dice...

Plays quick, very random, major dice screwage but fun. Noticed a few ways to deal with early dragons in our first plays. Had a tougher time with bad rolls than early/runaway leaders, the first 2/3 games have had come-from-behind wins. One buy limits you and forces tough choices and there is a little room for combos.

That said, this game doesn't really revolutionize anything but the filler genre. Hopefully gets fleshed out with meaningful expansions instead of smothered.

Quick brainless fun.

Advanced rules really help this game.
- Capture 2
- Cull the die to score
- Finish "round" when someone hits winning score

I love the dice, and enjoy the quirky art and humor of Quarriors! The whole package appeals to me and it just looks amazing from tin, to insert, to components (apart from the at first very crinkly dice bags - they get worn in quickly).

My initial impression of the gameplay was rather weak. It felt like a letdown of such a great premise, but having played the game some more and readjusted my expectations, I've come to really enjoy it as a great filler.

The original rules work only as a quick, random, and barely enjoyable dice-fest, but feel very lacking, not even up to filler status. However, with [b]the Advanced Capture, and Expert Culling Rules[/b] it turns into a much more tactical dice-fest that can be fully enjoyed even by gamers.

I quite like Quarriors! and it becomes much better still when combined with Quarriors! Quarmageddon. Its excellent box insert allows for super fast setup and tear down of the game, making it the true filler it should be. This will now be a steady closer on our game nights.


[b]Here are the rules we play by now:[/b]
* Advanced Capture Rule
* The Totally Expert Rule of Culling
* 3 Spells in the Wilds (normal rules, but we experimented with 4 Spells for a while)
* 7 Creatures in the Wilds (we used 8 for 15+ games, to make the Wilds be 4 rows of 4 cards with the 1 extra Spell and the Corrupted Quiddity Resource Cards). :p
* Portals are a regular Basic Resource in the Wilds (we experimented with having each player start with one instead of a Basic Quiddity and having no Portals in the Wild)
* 2-Player games are played to 20 Glory, 3 to 15 Glory, and 4 to 12 Glory as per the normal rules (we played every game to 20 Glory for 15+ games)

In short, we're back to the rules as written plus the [b]Optional Rules for Truly Epic Quarriors[/b]. :)


[i]However, we are tempted to try the house rule where an Assistant doesn't get Culled when Scoring, and instead allow you to Cull any other 1 die in its place.[/i]

Not a heavyweight by any means, but it's perfect for a time when you don't want to burn too many brain cells on your gaming! No huge rulebook to constantly refer to. I REALLY like this one! Will be interested to see how expansions are handled, but there's plenty in the base game to keep me happy for a good long while!

There are still a lot of aspects of Quarriors that I really enjoy. I love the dice building element, as deck building is probably my favorite genre, and I love the variety of monsters and effects, as well as the spells. The aesthetic is really appealing to me, as the art is very colorful and stylized, and I think that's how I prefer my games. Plus, the game play is still pretty good. I played it recently and remembered why I enjoyed it so much from the beginning, though the lack of real player interaction was always a bit of a disappointment to me. I also wish there was more of a structure, instead of just hitting up the one way to score victory points. I would love more of a "board" style for this game, but overall, it was a generally appealing product.

RATING: 8
I love that the replay value is increased by providing various cards for each type of die, so while a Death Incarnation is always a Death Incarnation, its exact efficacy can vary from game to game.  There are very interesting choices to make in this game.  The biggest downside is that players can dither with the dice on their turn, trying to min/max, but if you play with people who are willing to take chances (It [b]is[/b] a bloody dice game, after all!) just to see how it will work out, you should be just fine.  Also, gaining familiarity with the cards and game in general should help.  Otherwise, it plays nice and fast, and more importantly, I keep itching to play it again.

Don't let the MSRP scare you too badly:  You get 130 custom dice (5 of each special die, with a few extra basic [custom] dice), and several variations of each associated Power Card, as well as a nice dice bag for each player, and scoring cubes that actually match the bags' colors.  The cards are the cheap part, but they lend so, so much more replayability to the game — as if the unpredictable dice themselves didn't.

LOTS of dice! What's not to love about it? If you like dice in your games, by all means, get this game. The "deck building" aspect of the game makes this a really different experience from others. Obviously, this game relies somewhat in luck, but you can mitigate the luck factor with good choices throughout the game. Games are relatively quick and you can't beat the satisfaction of pulling out a cool combo from the available dice.

There is too much randomness in this game to recommend it to anyone but those that enjoy light games with lots of luck.

You have the first random element of "which dice am I going to draw this round" combined with the second random element of "what side are my dice going to land on?". On top of that, the dice design means that the individual dice mechanics can't be made to complex, because everything is represented through symbols. These two elements combine to make your game dull and uncontrollable, as you'll often just end up with mana rolls on all your monsters, preventing you from even attempting to get points.

Might be a tad too random to make it a winner in the deckbuilding category.

Otherwise very fun: the variation in dice using different cards is a neat idea, and it has quite a bit of interaction, which this genre of game tends to lack.

I have a great idea for a game:  You give me all of your money.  If you give me more than everybody else, you win!

That's collectable card games in a sentence.  Please sir, may I have another?  Arrrgh.  What do people see in these things?

I love Babylon 5.  This is the greatest TV show ever.  It will never be surpassed.  EVER.  Nothing has even come CLOSE.  And if you are one of those poor Star Trek suckers, go back to playing your Knizia Euro.  DS9 is B5 if you take all the good parts out.  Why don't you try to figure out why Spock threw Kirk on to a frozen planet instead of a Brig.  Doesn't the Enterprise have a brig?  Oh yeah, it does -- they threw Khan in it in the next movie.  Dude, your show is so lame, you actually think Jar Jar Abrahms writes great stories!  Game.  Set.  Match.

I'm sorry, where was I?  Oh yeah, Babylon 5.

So I get this game.  I buy a starter set for each of the major races.  I read the directions.  I call over a couple of friends who watch B5.  I teach them how to play the game and we start playing it.

We get ... NOWHERE.  We were stuck in hyperspace and we were way off the beacon.  Why?  Because we only had 4 starter decks.  SUPPOSEDLY that is enough to play the game.  In the same way, if you remove all of the atmosphere from Babylon 5, it's still a functioning space station: but everybody on it is dead (assuming the Vorlon ambassador is away).

We gave up.  I would have better luck playing 20 questions with Kosh.

If I had went out and spent tons of money, I'm sure I could have customized some really cool decks, but you know what?  Homey don't play that.  Give me a game and charge me a price.  If it's $100, so be it.  Those Star Trek fans are willing to pay it for crappy plastic ships and cardboard pieces that are thinner than the hair on my head.  Use your wonderful "expansions" and whatever money grubbing idea you can come up with, but when I buy a game, I'd better be able to play it.

If this "game" -- nay, set of collector cards -- were any worse, it would be [thing=483][/thing], which is why this game scores a 1.1, instead of the dreaded "1".

One of the better CCGs IMO. However, still has the main flaw of buying tons of cards just to get a workable game. Stopped buying cards years before the game stopped production.

RATING: 10
As far as I'm concerned, this game does everything right. It puts players in a situation where they HAVE to deal with the other players at the table, making and breaking deals, offering help and preparing for treachery.  It's exactly what I want from a multiplayer card game.  Shame it's dead!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A heck of a game - the rules are a pain in the ass to learn however once you get over them and start playing, it really gets amazingly good and intricate! It totally captures the feel of the series and is probably the best conversion of a fictional universe to the CCG format. Love it. Being a huge B5 fan also helps. :)

I constructed some beginner/moderate player decks in order to justify keeping this game.  I got a couple more boxes of boosters, but will hold onto this all for a while as I decide whether it's worth it or not.  Probably after a B5 viewing I'll flip over into "it's worth it".

RATING: 6
Good multi-player card game, which can be difficult to pull off. The collectible nature really hurt it, though, since there were so many axes of victory to follow you needed a large collection to build a coherent deck. Didn't play much beyond the first set, although I have picked up some later cards on clearance since.

RATING: 3
Multiplayer, this game is probably pretty sweet. As a two-player game it's no good. But if you're looking for a sweet multiplayer diplomacy game, there are so many to choose from that this is almost certainly not worth your money.

Lots of promise with this one, but it never panned out - issues in the basic set were exacerbated in expansions, and new problems were added. Precedence simply didn't have the skill to handle this one properly, and as a consequence they've now lost their license. A shame, as it was innovative at the time and showed a lot of promise, but the devil is in the details and they simply couldn't follow through (when some 6 people get design credits, this is never a good sign - I've become leery of games which have only 2 credited designers!).

RATING: 3
way too complex. Two decks of the same type may not play against each other.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
It's not a 10 because the game is without flaws, it's a 10 because it is extraordinarily good at what it is intended to do.  I'm puzzled why the average rating for this game is so low, having played it quite a bit.  The only conclusion that I can come to is that it is being compared to CCGs when it ought to be compared to games like Twilight Imperium.  This is intended to be an extremely involved, long, multiplayer game.  As a duel between two players, the game breaks down due to balance-destroying design flaws common in CCGs - since the player with the most brawn can do anything he or she wants.  When the game is played with 3-5 players, the player with the most brawn cannot do anything without diplomacy or trickery/opportunism.  I'm still hoping that this game will be rereleased as a boxed set, since while the CCG-ness of it allowed for a lot of flexibility in deck design the game is complex enough without the need to sift through a thousand different cards to put together a deck.

This game is really great when you play it for the first year.  I would have given it a 9 at first.  But as more expansion sets came out, the game weakened because the shadows become too overpowering.  Overall the game engine is great. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I really liked this at university and it's still  one of the few CCGs designed to be played multi-player rather than 1 v 1.  The fact that it's long dead is both a good and a bad thing; you can get boxes of boosters for dirt cheap now but, equally, they're not that easy to find any more.  1 or 2 AP players will kill it though.

RATING: 7
Nice group diplomacy game.  Works well in a group of four for the most part.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
There was simply too much "struggle" going on in this game. When I played, I felt like there was a 5-10 minute "early game build-up" period, followed by an hour or two of hopelessly stalemated back-and-forth. Then finally, the dam would break, and the "endgame" would take 5 minutes.

A two-hour game where only the last 10 minutes make any difference? No thanks, even if it is based on one of my favorite TV shows.

RATING: 6
The original set + first couple expansions capture the flavor of the show very well.  I'll have to try it with the later expansions if I can find other players!

Played a couple of times and it was fun but calling this a CCG kind of gives people the wrong Idea.The games we played were long.Its not MTG .Its a very political game with space combat and you have to be a big fan of Babylon 5 to truly enjoy this.

I have a few hundred of these that were traded to me--all look to be from the first set or two.  Have yet to really go through them and figure out what they are or how to play the game.


I had a starter set years ago and we played it for a bit but I was rather underwhelmed.  Seemed like an OK game, but I think you had to be a fan  of the show to go gaga over this.  Otherwise, if I want multi-player politics with a healthy dose of combat, I'll just play Vampire/Jyhad.

Captures the mood of the tv-series nicely and offers interesting and long sessions spiced with a bit of role-playing. But as with many other CCGs, it tends to be too long to be really rewarding. Conflict-system is nice though.

I got into this just as I was getting out of M:TG, which was just before discovering eurogames. I liked the theme and the specific tactics of the decks/races, but now would always prefer a good board game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Personally, I think this is one of the greatest CCGs ever made. I stopped collecting when the Crusade expansion came out, so it may have turned worse then.
Game is pretty good fro 2 players but really shines with more, lot&#039;s of wheeling and dealing to get people to support your conflicts and not attack you.

28.10.2009: [i]Babylon 5[/i] is probably my favorite TV show of all time, so I have a decent amount of cards for this good CCG. I haven't played it in a while though. I'm thinking about putting together four decks to be able to play this as a regular boardgame. I'll use the four base starters and tweak those.

RATING: 6
TCG based on the show, in which the players chose one of the four main races (a fifth, the walk-ons, was added in expansions) hoping to build victory points based on diplomacy, intrigue and/or combat — with Shadows and Vorlons getting into the mix. This was one game that kept getting better with each expansion.

BIG PLUS: each faction had balanced options
BIG MINUS: support collapsed with the end of the series and the game quickly left shelves soon after

The best of the few CCGs I invested in.  Requires more than two players to be at its best (which is a drawback for me, since it's usually just my wife and I).

Ah, Babylon 5 CCG. I feel the game captures the setting of the show relying on heavy political machinations backed up by giant space fleets. Very long at 3 hours and not very good with 2 players but if you can get a group together, space opera all the way. With malicious backstabbing.

While better than the Dr. Who CCG, this game (based on my third favorite show), was lacking.

RATING: 7
Superb CCG - especially in its ability to facilitate a massive level of Diplomacy between the players. Playing with carefully balanced pre-constructed decks left a lot of the frustration inherent in most CCG's out, which allowed us all to focus on the metagame. Suffers a bit from a long game length (4.5 hours!) but that is my only complaint.

-------------

03/12 - Just gets better on the second play. The decks had been refined a bit, and there seemed to be an intense cooperative struggle as factions formed and were dissolved over the course of play. Ratings bump to 9. This is the only CCG better than VTES.


--------------

Have been giving this one some thought (and playing both VTES and Netrunner again lately) and I think the flaws in this one are becoming more clear: game length is stupidly long for what it offers, and an attempt to, mechanically, bite off more than it can chew for the sake of theme--B5 is trying to do combat, politics, negotiation, stealth, tricks, etc etc all at once, without doing any of them very well. I will definitely play this again, but I don't think this is the greatest of the great the way I once felt.

Deep and clever gameplay with a strong focus on interaction between the different players. Don't expect a fast-paced game, this is for the ones that prefer a good build, almost like a 4x card game.

Spent a lot of money on this game. But I also got a lot of hours of enjoyment from it. Don't know if it was just our group but the conflicts were so hard fought that often games would take 5 hours to play. Later expansions unbalanced the game - esp Wheel of Fire and Crusade. (8.5)

RATING: 8
Perhaps my favorite CCG . Incredibly interactive game with a ton of strategy involved. With the amount of negotiation, you can almost think Diplomacy in card format. And to boot, there's a high faithfulness to the B5 universe and its dozens of storylines. Makes storytelling so utterly easy.  The biggest plus in my book, however, is that every card type is important in deck building. In many CCGs, only the 'interrupt' cards or 'character' cards have a strong effect on how strong a deck is. With B5CCG, every card type can be influential.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A fairly good game - plays well with 2-4 players and some great game mechanics (each race working to its own agenda - the balance of diplomacy against military action).

I misplaced it when we moved - hoping to find it again soon so I can get some more games in.

RATING: 6
Good game. I didn't have time or money to build better decks. Large learning curve, for me. Babylon 5!!

In order to play well, this is one of those games that it helps to know most of the cards. Also games are not quick, like Magic or Jyhad.

Purchased dual Human/Minbari & Narn/Centauri starter sets on clearance based more on love of show rather than interest in CCG. Purchased additional expansion cards sporadically, usually when found on clearance.No local player base-never played. Let it go in gaming purge of '10.

My favourite CCG, I have THOUSANDS of cards for this. Shame it died out. Still play it about every 1-2 months. Hard to get cards nowadays, but still in my opinion the no 1 ccg.

RATING: 10
Best CCG ever for 4 players, with very similar mechanics to the Game of Thrones CCG.  Gameplay has a real narrative to it, making it feel like alternative timelines from the actual TV show.  If you love gaming and Babylon 5, you simply can't go wrong with this game.

Babylon 5 Collectable Card Game (Precedence Publishing): I have 1400+ cards, including the 4 different starter decks (Earth Alliance, Minbari, Narn, Centauri), plus the Non-Aligned Worlds starter deck and Opposition Factions starter deck, and cards from many of the expansions, including Psi Corps, Severed Dreams, and Wheel of Fire. Played it with my friends when it first came out, with bad Centauri accents, but so much competes with my "free time", and I haven't played this in years. I also have some promo cards from the Zeta Squadron.

A very nice game system beneath some ugly stills from the series. I dissaprove of many of the later sets, but the core game was nice and deserved to be released in a non-collectible format.

Se tem um jogo que permite inúmeras estratégias... B5 CCG é um forte candidato !
Gosto particularmente da raça Centaury; os melhores jogos tem pelo menos um deck de cada raça superior: Centauri, Humano, Mimbari e Narn !

RATING: 7
a CCG designed for more than 2 players (best with 4).  Good rules, good theme integration.  Requires you to pre-build balanced decks and not abuse the two dominant deck construction strategies (shadows and vorlons).

If you like the theme, the game is loads of fun.  If not, it's still solid.

I haven't played this in long enough that I can't even rate it. I remember it being good, but it was in the midst of the glut of CCGs in the mid-90s so I couldn't get enough people to play it regularly. At some point, I should gather up all my cards and try to sell them.

RATING: 5
A lot of potential for a good game, but fell victim to two of the most common CCG mistakes: 1) far, far too many useless and badly designed cards; 2) the successive narrowing of deck designs meant that the metagame space eventually came down to whose big-ass combo hit first.
I have dreams of resurrecting this as a much more compact One Big Deck game.

I played this game throughout university and would go so far as to claim it may be the best thematic multiplayer card game ever made. Of course, you need to be a fan of the series to really enjoy it, but if you are, track this one down!

Very complicated and nonintuitive CCG. Nice setting and good graphics, but uses up a lot of time for learning and preparing the gameplay. Tends to use up a waste amount of cards too.

A great game of politics and intrigue helped along hugely by being a fan of the series, needs a few players to really get going though - even three feels a bit small

EXCELLENT game dealing with politics in the B5 universe, heavily encourages interaction and storytelling.  Some balance issues, tho, and the game seemed to not really know what to do with PSI.  Like B5 Wars, suffered the end of the series, but fans still hang on and play the game.  And they should, for it is a good game indeed.

A solid CCG envolves a good bit of thinking about what you are doing not just draw a card play a card. Also you only really need the four or six basic starter packs which you can find on e-bay for a reasonable price so not a cash sink like quite a few other CCGs I could mention. Oh should also mention no longer in print.

Sadly never really gets played as I have no opponents at the moment.

1) Campaign set #1 (Narn vs Centauri), cards like new 
2) Campaign set #2 (Mimbar vs Earth), cards still in original wrapping
3) Two opened booster packs (8 cards each, like new)

all items are in the campaign set #1 box, which is in very good condition. I did not keep the Campaign set #2 box

Looks like it could be cool. Tried to play with some starter decks and realized an hour in there was no way anyone could win the game with the cards included. I've bought two boxes of boosters to help with that, but haven't built anything yet.

One of my favorite multi-player CCGs. Lots of room for player interaction. Unfortunately, there are some strategies that seem to be overpowering. Also, the final set was never produced, leaving some ideas introduced but unexplored.

When I rated this a [b][bgcolor=#33cc99]&nbsp;9&nbsp;[/bgcolor][/b], I said:  Excellent game, but set aside a chunk of time for a good game of it.  :^)

Now I say:  This game does a splendid job of mimicking the intricacies of the show, and can be fascinating to play.  It is very difficult to make effective decks, however, since you can be pulled every which way during the game, and people are rarely willing to risk conflicts they don't expect to win.  While giving an accurate sense of the environment, it can make the game drag on for ages.  There are so many things I like about this game, but I've lost the will to play it, unless heavily coerced.

I went a little crazy and built six decks for my game group to play with, and we only played twice.  So far, I've had more fun building the decks than playing the game, but I hope to get it back on the table one day.

This is one of the best CCG's (like others here, I have played a lot) especially for multi-player. Lots of choices in deckbuilding and play, not too many broken cards (that weren't fixed by erata) and a very good representation of the charachters/races in the TV series universe.

The holy grail for murder mystery fans. An enjoyably different gaming experience - grab some wine and nibbles and settle in for an evening of laid-back puzzling. The time on the box is a downright lie. Allow 2-4 hours depending on how leisurely the pace you want to take is. And with 10 cases in the box, I'd recommend savouring them.

I've only played the first two cases so far, and both were enjoyable. Well written, challenging, but with logical solutions that were realistic to solve. I played both cases with my wife cooperatively, and that worked really well.

EDIT: We have now played most of the cases, and consider them of very varying quality.

Wow did we suck! I like the concept, the newspapers, the map, the directory, etc. It just doesn't work well with a large group, all talking and weighing in. Peer pressure will drive to a bad conclusion. It works better (IMO) with a smaller, more intimate group that are willing to really dig into each clue rather than just rolling semi-randomly from encounter to encounter.

Not as good as Gumshoe but very, very close. Streamlined the game mechanics a bit but the setting is charming and appealing. In any case I love it and would probalby buy every single expansion they came up with (sadly and surprisingly they are not yet thinking about translating them to english)

Wish this concept became more popular and games like thin one started to flow. Try it out, you won´t regret it.

One of a kind. Wonderfully written. I've thought about how it could be improved, but mechanically - there is nothing. There is nothing superfluous here, no fat - ffg this isn't. Really, the only possible improvement would be even better writing / case design but that would take a very significant talent indeed. ...or more cases - but that is not to say that there is not enough content here: we are admittedly slow players but it took us 6 hours to crack the first case. The second case only took 2 but we also spent two on the third without really getting to the crux of the matter... and those were some fun hours indeed.

RATING: 10
SHCD combines my love of literature with my enjoyment when solving mysteries/puzzles, and was just a ton of fun for me.  I played all 10 cases solo because I enjoyed it so much after playing the first case that I couldn't wait to keep playing.

Creating this game must have been a labour of love.  I can't imagine how difficult it is to come up with even one of these cases, let alone ten + expansions.  I'm in awe of what the authors have accomplished with this game.

With that said, it does have some flaws.  Typos, unsatisfying solutions that make you want to punch Sherlock, and (perhaps inevitably) some weaker cases.  Despite its flaws, one of my favourite games of all time and I will buy all of the reprinted expansions as soon as they come out.

Note : It is best played as an activity and not a game.  Don't try to compete with Sherlock, just enjoy each case and try to visit as many locations as you can to get as much of the texture of each scenario as possible.  Don't worry about your score, just be happy if you are able to solve the case.  Some of the cases I found really challenging.

Los clásicos juegos de "elige tu propia aventura" rediseñados al máximo: Busca las pistas del crimen e intenta igualar al famoso Sherlock! (Que si te acercas, dedícate a ello! jeje). Un juego atípico y muy original, que es algo distinto totalmente de un juego de mesa o un juego de rol.

A very nice choose your own adventure co-op. It is fun trying to figure out the small but important clues from the text. The storylines are interesting and twist in the plot not so obvious. However, I am afraid that after a few games you might start seeing patterns repeat themselves, i.e., it is not what you are being told but what is left unsaid that is important. This is also a game that I could truly imagine playing myself when you have all the time in the world to read over the text and you do not have vote for every decision, although haste and negotiation is part of the fun as well.

RATING: 9.5
Excellent deduction game from '81! This is not a boardgame in the common sense (cards or dice or moves or boards) but a collection of 10 cases that the player(s) must solve by gathering clues, visiting people, searching the newspapers for hints, etc. For fans of deduction games, this is so far the best game I found on the topic. What's more important, during the 2-3 hours that you will spend on the case, you will actually feel that you're visiting people, interviewing, questioning, findings hints etc.

Immersive experience.  Scenarios are difficult (at least at first).  Need patience and time to properly make a game of it.  First scenario was fantastic.  Second was pretty difficult, and we got stuck - even with help from Sherlock.  Hoping 3rd is more like the 1st.

I would love to give this game a "10" but translation issues and some of the more obtuse mysteries get in the way sometimes.  It's an excellent gateway game for people who don't generally like board games.  Highly recommended despite some niggling issues.

I am not a fan of deduction games, but this one is one glorious exception! My rating would be a 10, except for the fact that there will come an inevitable point when the limit of replayability is reached. And that is a gaming tragedy.


COMMENTS ON THE ENGLISH YSTARI EDITION: It's all quite wonderful; yet the font is, at times, challenging to decipher in both the directory and the cases. The most annoying problem, though, is the very poor proofreading job that was done (or not done?) on the text; there are many, many instances of misspellings, and (even worse) situations where isolated French words have never even been translated! This is annoying, but it still does not mar one of the best games ever made.

Fun game for me solo.  Not sure that is would work well with group unless they are really into theme and willing to sit around and read a lot of stuff.  Of course I think some of the paths to Sherlock's solutions are unrealistic, but I still enjoy following the leads and seeing how much I can pick up.

I am having to ration myself with this one due to the limited number of cases that come in the game. I have played three cases so far in a group of 4 people and enjoyed them immensely (well, maybe not number 3 so much). I would not want to play it with more than 4 though as there could be the issue of too many brains complicating things. 

I just wish Ystari would hurry up and see about publishing the other cases in English!!!

Consulting Detective is the more cerebral cousin of those turn to page 234 adventure books; more cerebral in that you have to figure out which page to turn to next for yourself.  The adventures in this package are pretty short and snappy, with Holmes frequently solving them in just a handful of clues.  I tend to take a longer, winding route.  This suggests to me that the level of difficulty is pitched pretty well.  

The Holmesian theming is very well done, from the scene setting introduction to each case to the copies of the Times that may contain useful information among reports from the Empire and adverts for snake oil. This was clearly a labour of love by enthusiasts for Conan Doyle's great creation.

Πολύ ενδιαφέρον παιχνίδι στο οποίο οι παίκτες σε ρόλο ντετέκτιβ προσπαθούν να λύσουν διάφορες υποθέσεις. Το κουτί περιλαμβάνει 10 σενάρια, έναν χάρτη του Λονδίνου και ένα χρυσό οδηγό με διευθύνσεις όλων των κατοίκων και των επιχειρήσεων. Επίσης περιλαμβάνονται και 10 εφημερίδες των Times μια δηλαδή για κάθε υπόθεση. :meeple:

Οπότε διαλέγουμε σενάριο, διαβάζουμε το εισαγωγικό κείμενο που αναφέρει συνήθως γενικά το τι έγινε, πότε, που και μετά είμαστε ελεύθεροι να κινηθούμε όπως θέλουμε. Μπορεί για παράδειγμα να θέλουμε να μιλήσουμε με κάποιον αυτόπτη μαρτυρα, βρίσκουμε την διευθυνσή του στο χρυσό οδηγό και μετά διαβάζουμε το αντίστοιχο κείμενο στο βιβλίο της υπόθεσης. Πολλές φορές βρίσκουμε στοιχεία και στην εφημερίδα της τότε ημέρας. ;)

Συνεχίζουμε με αυτό τον τρόπο μέχρι να πιστέψουμε ότι λύσαμε το μυστήριο και μετά απαντάμε σε κάποιες ερωτήσεις και βγάζουμε μια βαθμολογία ανάλογα με το αν απαντήσαμε σωστά αλλά και πόσες επισκέψεις χρησιμοποιήσαμε σε σχέση με τον Χολμς που λύνει και αυτός την υπόθεση παράλληλα με εμάς. Φυσικά υπάρχει και η αιτιολόγηση από τον Χολμς για το πως έλυσε την υπόθεση σε χρόνο dt. :cool:
 
Ουσιαστικά δεν πρόκειτε για επιτραπέζιο αφού δεν έχει καθόλου πιόνια, ταμπλό, κάρτες ή ζάρια, παρά μόνο κείμενο. Μαζευόμαστε με την παρέα, βάζουμε ανάλογη μουσική (προτείνω ambient μουσική από βικτωριανή αγγλία, άμαξες να περνάνε) αράζουμε στο καναπέ με κάνα μπουκάλι κρασί, κρατάμε σημειώσεις και αρχίζουμε τις θεωρίες. Περισσότερο σε γκρουπ activity φέρνει. Δεν μπορέσαμε ποτέ να κερδίσουμε τον Χολμς αλλά έχουμε και άλλα 5 σενάρια να δοκιμάσουμε. Who knows?  :p
  
Το παιχνίδι προσφέρει λοιπόν μια διαφορετικού τύπου εμπειρία πράγμα πολύτιμο σε ένα χόμπυ που λόγω υπερβολικής και συνεχής παραγωγής νέων παιχνιδιών καταλήγεις να βρίσκεις σχεδόν όλα τα παιχνίδια όμοια μεταξύ τους αφού δεν υπάρχει ο χρόνος και ο χώρος για να ξεχωρίσει κάποιο παιχνίδι.  

Συστήνεται ανεπιφύλακτα σε λάτρεις αστυνομικών υποθέσεων. Σε βάζει για τα καλά στο κλίμα της εποχής ενώ και ο τρόπος γραφής είναι πολύ κοντά στο πρωτότυπο. Προσοχή μόνο στην υπόθεση 3 που έχει λάθη. Εκτυπώστε τις διορθώσεις προτού την δοκιμάσετε. Δοκιμάστε επίσης και μερικά fan made σενάρια γατί το expansion αργεί ακόμα. :p

This is a fascinating deduction/story game. It sucks you into the story and you really become part of a murder mystery. I was worried that the answers would be too obscure and impossible to find but it actually seems reasonable. During the first case I was never sure how many "leads" I was supposed to have at the end...and it takes a little bit to get a feel for the game since you have to judge whether your line of thought is too simplistic or too complex. Great game!

I have only tried the first case solo so far.

It was a really cool experience. It really immerses you in the Conan Doyle's books atmosphere, and it is for sure a challenging deduction exercise.

However, I just felt close to impossible to figure out the solution following a number of clues that is close to the Sherlock benchmark. Maybe it will become easier if I play it cooperatively with a couple of friends.

Or maybe just forget about the benchmark and play the game competitively.

But it sure needs a playing group that is willing to engage with the format of this unique experience. And willing to read a lot too.

Libro-juego con cierto parecido a los antiguos libros de "Elige tu propia aventura" de mi niñez.

Bueno para un par de personas o un grupo no muy numeroso. Funciona mejor haciendo todos el caso de forma cooperativa. El modo competitivo es menos ágil.

Existe bastante diferencia entre unos casos y otros. Los dos primeros me parecieron aceptables, con un hilo argumental interesante y un flujo de pistas más o menos bien pensado. A partir de ahí los casos han ido decayendo cada vez más. Pocos caminos útiles a seguir, mucha idea feliz y flecos sin aclarar suficientemente. En general son casos poco pulidos y mucho más dependientes de la suerte. Además con alguna errata aquí y allá que puede fastidiar la experiencia.

Veo el juego algo desfasado en cuanto a mecánica y francamente mejorable en cuanto a su acabado. El método de puntuación es absolútamente ridículo. Puntuar más implica jugar menos ya que las pistas desveladas penalizan.

Tras 5 casos se agotó la paciencia y... patada a seguir.

The game is brilliant, with attention to detail and it really gets you into the theme. My only complaint is the scoring system, it is based more in luck than judgement ability.

I rate this a 10 because I love what it is striving to achieve and because I want to play it more often than I do. I'd play it more frequently, in fact, if it were not for the limited number of cases. It does have some flaws though that I've had to overlook: the conclusion of some of the cases appears impossible to arrive at for the players.

A very different game than what I usually play, it's got a free form feel to it as you research clues for your case in order to score high on a Quiz. Play it solo, play it co-op, it's thick with the theme and should thrill players of all ages who have ever found themselves immersed in the world of the famous detective. 'Kind of' a board game, since there is a map component, but it's more like a puzzle which you answer by poring over the case manuals, newspapers, and London Directory. Sweet.

Initial rating, based on playing once (the 1st scenario). Found the game rather unclear with what level of knowledge was expected of us. We understood main points pretty early on, but kept following leads because we thought we'd need to be able to name other parties to the plot. There's also not really enough material to keep a reasonably-sized group occupied. 2 or 3 players would be the sweet spot for this game. Reading all the text out loud takes a long time (not helped at all by the badly chosen font and many typos), and ultimately the game feels nearly pointless.

The game is brilliant but probably too difficult. I've played it once alone and the game exhausted me enormously. This is a great activity for 3-5 hours for 3-6 cooperating players and even then it is very difficult, but when you solve the case and answer all question the satisfaction is awesome, even though you score e.g. 90 pts, which is less than Sherlock.

I absolutely love this game.

It's simply, easy to learn, and consists of pure deduction and mystery-solving fun! You play one of the "Baker Street Irregulars", aka you solve the cases Sherlock doesn't have time for.

The replay-ability is limited because once you know the answers to the cases, it's hard/near-impossible to replay them. Also the translation from French to English left behind a few errors, that are more annoying that actually detrimental to gameplay. Normally, these cons might lower my rating, but the good things about the games outshine these minor problems. So other than that, this game is solid and a MUST for any game collection.

Régen voltam ilyen gondban játékértékeléskor. Nagyon különleges játékról beszélünk.

Kezdjük azzal, hogy teljesen egyedülálló szerintem, hogy egy olyan játékot, ami a 80-as években (gondolom) sikeres volt, aztán 20 évig nem adták ki, feledésbe merült, majd 2010 után előkaparták, és újra népszerű legyen. Itt ez történt. Az Ystari előszedte, leporolta és kiadta, majd pár éven belül a top100-ba ért. A merész az volt a dologban, hogy szerintem 2010-ig a BGG userek 1%-a ha hallott róla, tehát nem egy bejáratott névről volt szó. Szerencsére az Ystarinál valaki bízott benne, felkereste a szerzőket, stb.

A másik, ami miatt egyedülálló a játék, az a fizikai tartalma. Gyakorlatilag a térképen kívül csak füzetecskéket kapunk: egy névjegyzéket, egy szabálykönyvet, 10 újságot (=2 oldalas A3-asok), és 10 sztorifüzetet. Összesen 2-300 oldalnyi tömény szöveget, semmi mást. Nincs dobókocka. Nincs token. Nincs kis kocka, nincs figura, nincs semmi. Nyilván fakkos dobozbelső sem:) Egy doboz és benne egy könyvre való szöveg.

Ebből következőn messze a legnyelvfüggőbb játék, amit valaha próbáltam. Megjegyzem, direkt azzal a céllal vettem, hogy jó lesz nyelvgyakorlásra, úgyis azt mondják, kezdésként jók a detektívkönyvek, mert viszonylag rövidek, és hamar kiderül hogy értjük-e. Itt elérkeztünk az egyik problémához: némi szótárazgatással ment ugyan a dolog, de a folyamatos fordítás rányomta a bélyeget a játékélményemre. Vagyis az angolja nekem nehéz kicsit (ráadásul a nyomtatásnál használt betűtípus sem a legjobb). Hogy viszonyítani lehessen: Nehezebb, mint a játékszabályok, azokhoz már nem nagyon használok szótárat. Ehhez kellett. És nagyon nagy mennyiség. Az ügy felvázolása kb. 2 oldal volt, és némelyik helyszín szintén volt vagy 1 oldal, és mi jártunk vagy 15 helyszínen. És akkor még ott volt az újság is. És mivel itt minden szónak jelentősége van, alaposnak kellett lenni. És azért játék közben szótárazgatni órákon át nem túl vicces. Tanulság: legközelebb úgy ülök le, hogy legyen egy profi angolos a csapatban. Egyébként azt olvastam, hogy könnyű a nyomozós része, de nekünk szerintem részben a nyelvi kínlódás miatt nem volt könnyű, erre elment minden figyelmem, nem nagyon tudtam magára az ügyre koncentrálni. Ezzel együtt nem jártunk annyira messze... (gondolom ebből kiderült, hogy a csapatban, ami 2 főt jelentett, én tudtam legjobban angolul)

Másik amit problémának lehet nevezni az értékelésnél, hogy ez szerintem nem is annyira a klasszikus értelemben vett társasjáték, inkább színtiszta rejtvény, vagy rejtély megfejtés. Ez nem baj, mert szeretek ilyeneken agyalni, de szerintem teljesen más a célcsoportja mint mondjuk a legtöbb közismert társasnak. Ha ezt lefordítanák és kitennék a tescoba, simán vinnék olyanok is, akik életükben nem társasoztak, és ettől nem is feltétlen jönne meg a kedvük úgy általában a társasokhoz, de lehet hogy tökre bejönne nekik mint rejtélymegoldó játék. Tehát ez egy teljesen külön kategória, lehet hogy ezzel is magyarázható a sikere. Még csak hasonlót se láttam a piacon.

Összességében nagyon tematikus és letisztult. Aki szereti úgy általában a krimit, a nyomozgatós filmeket-könyveket, az szeretni fogja. A kelléktár egyszerű. Van egy sztori, és a névjegyzéket meg a térképet meg az újságokat használhatjuk, és a helyszínekről kapunk infót az ügyhöz tartozó kis füzetből. Jegyzetelhetünk és a végén kérdésekre kell válaszolni. Még megoldókulcs is van, Sherlock levezeti, hogy kellett volna megoldani. Szerintem nagyon elegáns, hogy mondjuk az 5. ügynél az összes korábbi újság is használható, bár még ott nem járok, de feltételezem hogy van is értelme, ha kitér rá a szabály, tehát akadnak a régebbi újságokban is információmorzsák a későbbiekre vonatkozóan.

Felmerülhet az újrajátszhatóság. Jogosan. Összesen 10 ügy van. De egyrészt vannak kiegek (igaz eddig főleg csak franciául), másrészt 1-1 ügy megoldása nem két perc. És valahogy ez nem az a játék, amit mondjuk hetente elő akarnék venni, tehát engem nem zavar hogy csak 10 ügy van. Évente tartunk néhány nyomozást, és mire a végére érünk már lehet hogy nem emlékszünk a régebbi ügyek csattanójára. Megjegyzem, a névjegyzék pl. már némelyik kieghez szükséges adatokat is tartalmazza.

A játék nagy pozizívuma, hogy szinte tetszőleges létszámmal játszható, és lehet egymás ellen és coop módban is.

Nyomozni szeretőknek mindenképp ajánlom, de ismerjék jól az idegen nyelvet:)

Eszembe jutott a játék egy nagy hibája: reprodukálható sima fénymásolással...

---
Az első 3 sztorin vagyunk túl. A durva nyelvfüggőség miatt eladtam, de nem zárom ki, hogy még játszom majd valaha vele. Negatívum, hogy volt olyan sztori, amit nem éreztünk elég egzaktnak (a 3.-at). Elég érdekes egyébként, hogy mekkora szórás van a sztorik terjedelmében. A helyszínek szövegei van ahol csak 6 oldalt tesznek ki, máshol 20+ oldalt. Amit fontosnak tartok, hogy kis kockákat tehettek volna a játékba, mi házilag szedtünk elő párat, mert jó a bejárt és/vagy szóbajövő helyszíneket más-más színnel jelölgetni.

3 parti alapján a játék legnagyobb erősségének a hangulatát tartom.

I found this to be a slow and frustrating experience. I normally like analytical puzzles, and this game comes with lovely high quality maps, booklets and newspaper clippings, but for some reason this one did not connect with me. It just feels like an old fashioned choose your own adventure book and some of the clues are a bit tenuous. Ultimately I didn't feel that this game was worth the effort required to play it.

RATING: 9.7
Very alternative way of thinking. Got to have the right group to play. This game is a genre itself, an excellent addition to boardgames.

After some plays, I have to say, the game plays A LOT better if you master your first case. It should have a walkthrough and a sample story I think.

Also, some stories, e.g. story 7 (Banker's Quietus) seem almost impossible to solve completely and there is no explanation of how Holmes walked through some of the deductive steps. This is the only fault of the game.

This is a unique game. And I really mean unique: nothing else is even close to Sherlock Holmes!

It is a kind of free form (there's no rules!) coop game book, reeking Victorian atmosphere, with exactly ten plays available. Then, you must find other cases (official expansions or fan-made) otherwise is game over... But what great 10 plays! The cases are well thought out, very "Holmesian", and make for a fantastic and unique (did I just use again this word?), almost RPG-esque gameplay experience!

I love reading, and at most I love detective stories. This game seems made for me!

It's an atypical board game. Good fun for when we do not want the hassle of setting up a board, or for when we want a more conversant game experience.

Edit April 2017: We've only managed to play 2 cases in the base box. While we did enjoy each case, we've played other games instead of pulling this back out. It's unique enough to stay in the collection until we get through the cases, but I don't know how long it will be until we finish them. I'm glad I paid the $25 or so dollars for my version; the newest version (est. OLGS price of $42) is priced too high, in my opinion.

A lot of reading in this game. It is almost a "Choose your own adventure" of Sherlock Holmes.

Very clever concept and it flows ok. You do have to be in the correct thinky frame of mind to play this.

Haven't touched this one in a long time. My impression was that the game was a little bit too much like a book and too little game. I also remember the ridiculous scoring method where you compared the number of leads it took you to solve the crime and compared it with SH himself. Much more fun to solve the crime thoroughly and completely, and forget about the score.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The game is fun, but the scoring system is kind of strange. Every case has a secondary case that Holmes never investigates that reward points, which makes it confusing if you should go after that, because if you don't you are missing out on the game, but if you do, you have no chance of beating Holmes.

Also, case 3 has some errors that should be read into before frustratingly going through the case.

This game reminds me of one of those old choose your own adventure books, except it's completely open ended (well, almost). I have fond memories of my mother and I sitting at our old dining room table on Sundays and playing this for hours. I recently acquired it again and although it's lost a little bit of its luster for me (not much replayability, no interaction if playing competitively), it's still quite an experience to play. And it's great solo as well, a plus for me!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
You'd think that getting to crack just 10 murder mystery scenarios without any replay value is the sort of Baker Street dozen that will make you feel short changed, but then you'd have missed the vital clue: it is a Baker St one. This is one of the most atmospheric games I have ever played, and the makers have gone to extraordinary lengths to evoke the spirit of the Times.

You will never get closer to donning the mantle of Sherlock, and if you indeed manage to close cases with the bare minimum of clues you are certainly worthy of it. Boy these babies are well written. They are perfect solo material, but it's a waste to do them on your own. It's the sort of game that makes you want to boast about your cleverness afterwards. Well, celebrating that one moment of genius anyway, rather than being reminded of the long clue-hunt around town, figuring out that what was bleeding obvious to someone who had studied the play aids with a bit more imaginative attention. Yes, some cases can be cracked with just 2 clues, but only if you have the Sherlock genes. It won't stop most of us getting lost in the London fog for quite a bit longer than that, but the thrill of unravelling the intertwined plot-lines that wee bit slower doesn't make it less enjoyable for the slow puzzlers amongst us. There are several roads to solve a case, with a generous sprinkling of red herrings to keep you on your toes, spread across 50-odd locations per case. Sometimes the slow solvers are the only ones to encounter all aspects of a case, and can actually beat the score of the "perfect sleuths" by knowing more of the background story. It's a wonderful mechanic.

This one oozes atmosphere. It is the little period details that are slipped in, about late 19th century events and developments that do a wonderful job at keeping up the illusion. I know few games that drag you into the setting as effortlessly as this gem, it is all you could want it to be. It is an experience so entirely immersing that at the end you do wish you had your own little pocket Watson to write up the newspaper column detailing your private roadmap to the grand unveiling.

This isn't Cluedo or any of the other usual suspects, where it has to be one of a limited amount of abstract permutations. No Mrs White, in the Library, with the Rope. The cases are well written, as colourful as any of the Conan Doyle plots, and it will take some mental agility to find the quickest way to crack a case. The initial scene is presented with a small introduction of a few paragraphs, but it's up to you to spot the clues, study the map of London, race around town using the phonebook to pin down the less obvious locations, and put the newspaper clippings to good use. And use your petite grey cells, mon ami. It reminds me of my childhood days with Jumbo's Orient Express, which also had genuine cases to solve, but they are no match for the quality, complexity, and impressive Victorian period detail on offer here (with only the occasional annoying Americanism, in writing that ought to be solid Queen's English). What they do have in common is the pressure to make "that tricky call". You know that you can hang around for a couple more turns to obtain clues that will confirm (or waylay) your suspicions, but you know it's a race against time, and the real challenge is to call it as early as possible. When you play it competitively it is great to hear others present their solutions to the case. That's usually the point when doubt about your own version of events starts to creep in, no matter how sure you were when you jotted it down.

Fact: it is put together with great eye for detail, fairly unique in its approach, feels more like interactive fiction than a conventional game, and equally enjoyable as a solo, competitive, or co-operative game. Fact: it is a labour of love, the setting research and ambiance is on a par with the best Call of Cthulhu RPG scenarios, compiled with the same fanatical attention for detail. Fact: ten cases isn't nearly enough, but thankfully there are expansions. If there was an endless amount of cases to solve, it's elementary, it would score a solid 10 my dear Watson.

have you always harbored a secret desire to be watson or lestrade and get constantly mocked and patronized by the drug-addicted high-functioning sociopath who lives at 221B baker street? do you get excited by the idea of being many steps behind the greatest detective of all time? do you have a weird fantasy involving sherlock and humiliation? im not saying i do, but if you did, you'd love this game.

game setup is easy. you get a map of london and some newspapers. i recommend you get a notebook to keep track of shit. unless you have a mind palace liek sherlock. i once tried going to my mind palace. it was a dumpster. there was a raccoon named fred. he told me 'everyone's laughing at you. you have to make them stop. make them stop."
anyways, i wouldn't recommend using a mind palace. small children may find the game too complex and the mysteries too convoluted.

RATING: 9
Less a typical board game and more of an elaborate pick-a-path book that puts you in the shoes of Holmes's proteges and tasks you with solving a unique Baker St mystery. Each of the ten cases included in the box is a one-off puzzle to be solved, and they are really well written and tough to work out. There is no hand-holding, and players will have to use all their powers of logic and investigation to figure out whodunnit. Technically you're competing as a team against Holmes, but that bastard always figures it out in about four turns, so really it's just a joy to work together to nut out the whos, hows and whys and then find out [i]you were right[/i]. Perfect game for couples.

I'm quite torn on this game. On the one hand I absolutely loved the way it made me feel while we were playing. It was like reading an actual murder mystery novel and trying to come up with the solution before the detective does it for you. It led to lots of interesting discussions amongst the group, and we came up with a ton of intriguing theories. Yet after all this fun deduction and debate, we read the solution and I felt there was not a chance for us to come up with those answers. I even reexamined clues that we never read, and saw no conceivable way they could have led us to that solution. I'm fine with them sowing lots of red herrings into the game and making it tough on the detectives, but it should at least be possible when the right path is taken. I also fear the replayability is just a bit too low to be worth the cost. I understand that this is inevitable because of the amount of detail they put into each mystery, but since the solutions are so memorable, I don't think you could ever replay the same mystery. In the end I think it's a good game, because I can't deny the pure enjoyment I experienced while playing, I just wish it was executed slightly different.

A very different "game."  It's more of a choose-your-own-adventure mystery story.  Having played one round... "The Munitions Magnate", we struggled quite a bit and had loads of fun with the game.  I very much look forward to more of this game!  I've learned a lot about how to approach future cases.

Consulting Detective is so thematical that playing it really feels like a Sherlock Holmes story, if only slightly apocryphal: as such, it stands in the twilight zone between proper boardgames and diceless RPGs but doesn’t belong to either, as on the one side its rules are both too loose for a boardgame and dangerously close to an RPG’s whilst on the other they don’t provide players with as much free hand as any RPG would.

Anyhow, playing Consulting Detective is a great fun: sadly, it lacks in anything random, which makes replaying a scenario impossible as soon as you know what the plot was, where the relevant testimonies are and, even more so, how Sherlock Holmes’ preternatural deduction skills got the case solved.

This makes for its major - and likely only - downside as well.

Only the lack of re-playability keeps this from a higher rating. At its best with teams to spread the reading load and keep up the pace. Then having taken 13 turns to get half-way to the answer you can groan as Sherlock knocks it off in four :-)

Did the first 2 cases. Wow! If you want to play a real dedective game, don't look further.  I'm so into it when i try to solve the case and try to beat Sherlock.  Even if you don't try to beat sherlock at all cause and you play for fun, it is a real well construct game with great narrative and great mystery.  I solve the first one but visit many location (score 20), and the second I try to beat Sherlock by visiting few location but i fail (score -20).

Best detective game, I played with my girlfriend and i can wait until the next case to solve together.

RATING: 8
A game truly unlike any other. Each mission could take anywhere between 1-3 hours depending on how thorough and how perceptive your team is. Mission 3 is horrible in the latest production run due to translation issues, and there are other occasional typos that prevent this game from being a solid 10, but it's still entirely worthwhile.

After having finished it in its entirety, the scoring in general seems wildly unfair. How on earth are we to have determined some motivation withkut any clues? If you ignore the scoring and play the game for its own self, you'll have a better time.

I have the Sleuth Publications original Consulting Detective and the first expansion, The Mansion Murders. I remember distinctly playing with one of the authors at a game convention in Chicago in 1982 or '83. On the strength of that one tough play, I bought the game and the first expansion—but could never convince anyone at home to play. Slaying goblins in D&D or sinking third-rates in WS&IM was the order of the day with my group most of the time.

I've been eyeing the Ystari/Asmodee reprint for some time and have finally secured a copy in English. I look forward to giving this unique game a second chance with a new cotorie of players. I'm sure, with games like Tales of the Arabian Nights and Star Trek: the Adventure Game already having traction, I can find someone else to give it a spin. I would play solo, but that just doesn't seem like much fun to me. But I will certainly do that with the new game, if necessary.

The production in this new edition is top-notch, though the syntax for the English edition could have stood another pass with a native speaker. The one clear advantage of the original game over the new: the original made lavish use of the old Sydney Paget Strand magazine illustrations and I quite miss them in the new game, though a new generation of gamers is really not missing anything. Just a touch that gave the original some welcome period feeling. I'll be happy to report on this one again when I have some cases under my belt.

Update 12.07.2012: Played my first full game with three other players in cooperative. We managed to solve the case of the munitions magnate in 23 leads and answering all questions at the end correctly. Holmes finished the case in 4 leads and the case granted us 4 "gimmes" for places visited. Our final score was 65.

Our table was pleased, for its first try. We might have had a score of 75, but we visited Holmes and the Yard, which were unneccessary based on the amount of evidence already gathered.

It was a great time!

Great game for couples. Mysteries very difficult. Definitely set aside at least 2 hrs, probably closer to 3, in order to get the necessary clues to solve the crimes. Level of difficulty is very high. The wife and I took until the 4th mystery until we were able to answer all of the questions correctly.

I've only played this solo so I can't speak to the multiplayer experience. The idea of the game and the feel of the game as it's played are like nothing else. It really feels like you're on a mission; I put a lot of pressure on myself to try to unpack the solution against the measure of the game. Asa fan I will offer one warning: one problem is that sometimes the solution and the solitaire measure of success - Holmes' course through the mystery - aren't entirely fair as they are presented. Red herrings abound and often times leaps of association are expected, most often in Holmes' solutions, and of a type that would go unrewarded nine times out of ten. One scores points in this game by solving the mystery in the fewest possible steps - which means that while you're playing it, a major goal is actually to experience LESS of what the game has provided you. Tightening up of some of the cases and the text of the clues would solve this, I think. Still, if it sounds like I'm being too critical, understand that this criticism comes from the occasional frustration with a game I love to play. That criticism only is really relevant for solitaire play, too, as more than one player would be dealing with the same obstacles. I am sorely hoping for English language expansions; I would purchase them immediately.

I bought this game after watching Shut Up & Sit Down's entertaining review of the game (thank you Quinn!). After the first play though, the play group did exceptionally well and really had a hard time figuring it out. We didn't crack the case until the very end. It truly was a mystery and we really did figure it out. WAY more fun than I expected.

It also is a relaxing way to spend an evening and it gives lessons in memory and thorough not taking and picking up on detail.

5x5 2017. Sort of an expanded choose your own adventure game and so it's not that much of a board game to me.  There are 10 cases which is a lot of content, so even though you can't really replay the cases, it's a good value.  Pretty impressive how its all written and put together.  This is a good case study for me in how the group really makes the game.

I would love to give this game a 10.  It's truly unique, exciting in a group or simply enthralling in solo play.  Average play time per mission for me has been about 4 or 5 hours of intense contemplation of evidence and facts, reading news papers, and trying to read my gut feelings.  After all of this I truly feel like a detective, and if this sounds like fun to you, you're probably right.  
  This being said, there are some problems with the game.  There are numerous typos.  Much of the language in the books is antiquated, meaning you're probably going to consult google at least a couple times to find the meaning of a word.  Sometimes you're going to then realize that the word you're looking up doesn't exist and then try to figure out what they meant to right there.  As particularly potent example, in one of the cases the editor did a find and replace to change all instanced of "die" to "the"  And it took a while to figure out why so many people had "thed" until we found out about a certain professors "stuthes."  There are some solutions which are accurate for older versions of the game, but were not updated to reflect changes to the story in the newer edition.  They're pretty easy to spot and figure out exactly what was changed though.  Also be warned, most of the cases are great, but case 3 is complete rubbish.
  If you are willing to accept these flaws, you're in for some of the hardest game play out there, but with enough work, instinct, and attention to detail they are all solvable, although sometimes - just barely.  You'll probably fail a few, and slap your forehead saying "Oh, it was right there the whole time!  But it was so easy to assume it wasn't"  When you do get the solution right though it feels amazing, because you know exactly how the game was stacking the odds against you.
  Good luck sleuths!

Es un juego dificil de clasificar. Desde luego no es un juego de mesa al uso. Contiene 10 historias/misterios que hay que resolver, compitiendo con Sherlock holmes. Sherlock será capaz de resolverlo con un númeo de pistas. Cuando el misterio es resuelto, el/los investigadores tienen que responder una serie de preguntas y obtienen una puntuación según las respuestas y ver cuantas pistas fueron necesarias.

Es más parecido a un libro-aventura que a un juego de mesa. Tiene más valor como experiencia que como otra cosa. Se disfruta según la predisposición de los partipantes.

En todo caso, no es mi tipo de juego. Está bien probarlo, pero no me muero por jguarlo.

I don't even know how to categorize this game. It is so much fun and was one of the best gaming experiences I've had.

After playing once, here's what I will do next time to make it even better:
- Photocopy the newspaper and opening case story for everyone
- Forget trying to beat Sherlock and just have fun
- Not play with more than 4 or 5 people tops

Playing with 7 and trying to beat Sherlock's score led to some agonizing debates and caused a few people to feel totally left out because there were only so many thing we could pass around.

That being said, it was STILL one of the best gaming experience I've had!

Love the concept. Simple deduction, well executed. The map and newspaper are great sources of entertainment and clues.

One of the strongest themes I've ever encountered in a game.  If you're into gaslight London, find this.  Now.  That said... there are some baffling leaps of logic.  Some cases can be quite frustrating, and you just have to roll with it.  And good luck beating Sherlock's path, you'll need clairvoyance.  Best with 2 teams of players, so you can kibitz together.  Works fine that way with an odd number of players.  Also works surprisingly well solo.  A flawed gem of a game.

This is a brilliant deduction game: You can look for clues at any point on the map, so you can actively search for clues and come up with ideas on where to look next. This sets this game apart from other deduction games, which usually are either just logic puzzle, or storytelling games without any real opportunities for deduction.

The components are great and provide a nice atmosphere. The stories are interesting and well thought out.

A very creative, fun, and engaging game. Probably the closest game that comes to an RPG that I own anymore. We stopped trying to get a good score about three cases in, and our enjoyment increased threefold, if only because we now read most of the clues, so we don't miss anything anymore!

Some of the solutions are really weird ("What? We were supposed to guess THAT?!?"), and the typos are abundant and unfortunate. But despite its flaws, the game is one of a kind. It's also nice that you don't need a table to play. (which is why this is now our go-to game for road trips!)

This is a very unique game that is a bit of a gem amongst the modern scene.  It's a paragraph driven game whose sole mechanic relies on you following clues to various locations (a suspect's address, the scene of the crime, the coroner's office for more information, etc.).  You have a number of tools at your disposal to further refine your lead selection and formulate your hypothesis on who the murderer was and what of his/her motivation.

It's so different from anything else you will play that I urge anyone with even an inkling of interest in deduction games to check it out.  It's pure, engaging, and addictive.

This is the most thematic game I have played yet. There are so many elements built into each story that are simply there to fill up the world. Oscar Wilde said for art to be art, it must serve no purpose. If that is the case, then the theme in this game is nothing short of art. And the fact that you can lay down on the couch with a glass of wine and play is great. My only gripe is that in some cases, Sherlock's solution isn't convincing enough to give you closure. Also, you will never beat him... Ever!

RATING: 10
UPDATE, 1/7: Consulting Detective is a hard game. It is hard enough just solve the case, let alone beat it faster, or with more points, than Sherlock. The key is to remember that you aren't simply deducing the solution from known facts that you uncover as you move around London, but that you are actually trying to imaginatively find a hypothesis that fits those facts. Many cases require intuition and vision, or maybe even psychic powers, to solve completely. In other words, you have to find the solution the same way Holmes does: through creative work, careful (and by that I mean CAREFUL) attention to detail, and rigorous sleuthing. Making the assumption that you can solve the mysteries by going from lead to lead until the truth reveals itself in facts that follow coherently from one to another will probably lead to frustration. Finding the connections between clues and reconstructing the crime scene require a writerly imagination as much as a logical mind.

New plan of attack: Five cases in, I think I'm going to quit worrying about even trying to beat Sherlock and just spend as much time as possible in this Victorian London world tracking down leads and enjoying the writing and world-building of this brilliantly-imagined game. My impatience to solve the cases as fast as possible has lead to my missing important clues.

UPDATE, 12/30: The new Asmodee is great, if a little too glossy for my tastes. My original rating (see below) was based on solitaire play. Having played it cooperatively now, I absolutely adore this game. Consulting Detective is a thematic and fun as any other game I own. Like my other recent favorites ASL and High Frontier, SHCD is immersive in exactly the way I love: you actually 'feel' your way into the Holmes' Victorian world. 

Unlike TotAn or CYOA, which I find limiting in ways that aren't as quite as satisfying, in SH you feel more free to move about its world because the nature of mystery storytelling encourages you to limit your choices (by racing against Holmes) and stay "on script" (by only following up on viable leads). The lovely writing, despite the occasional typos and mistranslations, paints in the edges of the canvas in a way that encourages a deeper narrative-immersion than ToTAN (which I still love). What a disappointment to see a game as engrossing and original as Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective sit in the 300's on BGG with all the cookie-cutter dreck between it and the top 10.

I have very little interest in playing Consluting Detective competitively; the game is hard enough with a team of detectives and a good part of the fun is reading outloud with the other players and discussing the next best step. As with all co-ops, beware the bossy-pants alpha-male gamer!

Caution: Consulting Detective is not like any other game I've played. It combines (light) literature and gaming into a hybrid art that works wonderfully as gaming-lit. It requires literacy, patience, and the ability to allow oneself to be teleported to and immersed in another world through the cooperative use of imagination. The mysteries are difficult and occasionally frustrating, requiring leaps in logic that involve imaginative reconstruction rather than simple deduction from known facts. This can give the impression that the cases are either flawed or just too damn hard, but close attention to the solutions and Holmes's thinking usually reveals each case's inner coherence. 

Potential downsides: 1. The solutions can sometimes be really obscure. 2. It might be impossible to beat the case in fewer leads than Sherlock, though I think outscoring him is possible thanks to the tangential mysteries that each case contains. 3. The strange and old-fashioned nature of the gameplay (reading outloud, etc.) may turn off gamers who have limited imagination, who lack of patience, or who are uninterested in the theme. The lack of replayibility, while sad, makes each case sweeter in the same way that meditating on the fact that you're only allotted so many sunrises ought to make each day a little sweeter. Limits make things beautiful and help you appreciate them. Plus, unlike life, there is the potential for expansions. 

ORIGINAL COMMENTS: I guess I'm not a big fan of Sherlock Holmes.  I found this slightly boring.  There are better paragraph based boardgames out there.  Strictly for Holmes fans in my opinion.

RATING: 7
Neat! Really feels like solving a mystery. Interactive fiction. The flavor is great.

Personally, I'm not a fan of being penalized for following leads. To me, the fun is in experiencing the whole "story" rather than just being as efficient as possible. I'm happy to play and ignore points and just see if I can solve the mystery, frankly.

We played the recent Ystari edition and the script the booklets are written in is irritating. It can be hard to read. In this case, I would have preferred function over flavor.

The game also feels a little long for just being a puzzle. Some of the flavor text sections are a bit too long. If these were trimmed, it'd probably move a bit faster. But even so completing this in an hour seems unlikely.

All in all though, cool unique game. I'd say if you grew up liking Choose Your Own Adventure books you'd probably like this too!

Have only played one case so far, but I loved it. The concept is great, and I was amazed they were able to pull it off. The writing is insanely good considering how much there is and the fact that you will only ever read about 20% max of the material. The case files, newspapers, map etc. are all well produced and really evoke the era. The first case we were onto the murderer pretty quickly, but there were enough red herrings that we were in doubt the whole time. Absolutely nothing else like it. Perfect for couples.

"The game is afoot!" This will get the little grey cells working. Okay, wrong detective but something a bit different. Hardly qualifies as a game; more of a fiendishly difficult puzzle. I've done six of these now and only come close a couple of times. Some of the clues can be rather unsatisfying - there's not always enough evidence to allow you to deduce the solution that Holmes comes to.

I think this is a really cool idea/execution for a game. The cases are legitimately complex, and it takes some hard thinking to suss out the mystery. I'd say the only downside is that while it does provide you with 10 cases to play/solve, that's about it for replayability. Still, very cool for a themed night with friends!

This game is phenomenal. I've never had as much fun with a game before: we've notebooks full of case notes and commentary from this game and its expansions.
We played each case to uncover the story, not to race sherlock. These are well written (other than all the typos, the poorly done changes to a particular case...)—the amount of atmosphere it incredible.

I cannot recommend this highly enough. SHCD and its expansions supplied us with most of a year's worth of date nights.

I played this with my dad and brother on thanksgiving.  I loved the feeling it gave, of actually trying to solve the murder.  How do you follow up the information you have been given?  Is there a clue in that sentence that was read?  This gentleman's name is in the newspaper, does that even change anything?  We ended up giving up after we followed a red herring too far, but I can not wait to take another crack at that case.  Do note that this is not a casual game.  You will want to bring a pencil and paper and take notes.

Amazing game, simple mechanics but it delivers a great experience if you’re into deduction games. It really tests your logical and deduction skills as well as your imagination when you hit a dead-end.

Played the first three cases so far with my gf and we have noticed that it’s better to play it when you have enough time ahead of you so you don’t rush deductions. Follow leads, take detailed notes, build timelines, study the map carefully, and take your time analyzing your data. Taking breaks or playing over multiple sessions (not too spread though) also helps, as it gives you a chance to clear your head and come back with new ideas.

Trying to beat Sherlock is not really worth it. It will most likely lead to missing large part of the story or wrong deductions. We’ve found that it’s better if you first try to get the full picture of what happened, and then worry about how many leads you’ve used. If you care about final score and how you fare against Sherlock, then think very carefully when deciding which lead to follow.

I think the best player count is 2 as it  allows you to exchange ideas while the game remains easy to follow. With many people and some of them having less patience than others might spoil the fun.

Case #1: 95 points
Case #2: 30 points (missed important leads and rushed it)
Case #3: 80 points
Case #5: 105 points

Played the corrected version (2016-2).

2015-12-20: Very fun and thinky game, though I am not sure that *even if* I solved the case in as few steps as Holmes that there would have been enough points for me to "win".  But a fun exercise - reminds me of a detective version of the old "Choose Your Own Adventure" games and especially of the "White Wolf" series of fantasy games.  Fun, challenging, and lots of sifting through the debris to find the answers.  I enjoyed it.

RATING: 10
In this game, you are a member of the Baker Street Irregulars that try to solve the mystery along with or before Sherlock. It was created in the 80's and was translated from French to English (for some reason they don't go back and fix mistranslations)

Out of the gate i'm going to go ahead and say that you and your husband will love this game. I would highly recommend it for a couple's game only. You can play with really as many people as you want but I LOVE the time and adventure that my wife and I have during the game.

It is not a typical board game as you only have a Case booklet, Map of Sherlock's London, a London Directory (corresponds with locations on the map) and newspapers.

To start a game you read the beginning of the Case booklet where you learn the details of the case in 221B Baker Street with Sherlock and Holmes. At the end of the beginning details, you are off (without Sherlock or Holmes) to decide where in London you need to go and learn more about the case.

As you visit places on the map, let's say you want to visit the brother of the deceased. You look up the brother in the directory, 54NW, and look that location up in the Case booklet and read the paragraph(s) with it to learn more information.

My wife and I and I played it our first game and we took meticulous notes and played over the course of 12 hours. I KNOW THAT'S A LONG TIME but it was so much fun. You can realistically play it as long or as short as you want OR you can play it over the stretch of several days.

We just so happen to have been able to have the kiddos at the grandparents the days that we played the 1st and 2nd case. We went a LOT faster on the 2nd case as we kind of knew what we needed to do. We even took it with us to dinner and talked about the case there and read stuff in the car.

I will warn you that it is only 10 cases and there is little to no replay-ability. BUT would you rather love and to never love again that to have never watched the show Firefly? TOTALLY worth it.

I've only played this once, but what a fantastic experience it was. You really do feel like a detective slowly piecing together a case. The thing that caught me off guard (and the thing I love about this the most, honestly) is that there wasn't a clue or sequence of events you'll find that spells out what happened. Nobody said "Okay, you got me, I did this." It's all shrouded in ambiguity and you have to make judgement calls - just like in real life.

Oh, and Sherlock's solution at the end will make you feel like an absolute idiot.

I can't wait to play this again.

Edit: I PLAYED THIS AGAIN. I really did not like the second case nearly as much as the first. Without spoilers, I feel that it was not constructed as well. I'm still very excited to try the rest of the cases.

Not a game the way most think of a game.  Still a great way to exercise your deduction skills.  This is more an experience than a game, and not as geeky as most RPGs out there due to the theme.  

I don't worry about the number of clues and the score at the end of the game.  These seem like a crazy tacked on portion of the game to try to make it a "game".  When we pull this our, we are more interested in having a fun experience.. scored be damned.

This is the only game (barring RPGs) during which I felt as if I was living the narrative. The directory, the newspapers, and the map all play a major part in bringing Holmes's London to life.

Tough to decide if I love it or hate it. The mysteries do not give you enough clues to be certain of much even if you check all the clues - which you don't because each one costs points. It feels like there is little deduction but many massive leaps of creative filling in of gaps to solve the crimes. I would like it better if it actually involved more logic probably.

When you take three types of games that I already love and mix them together, you just know I'm going to give it a good rating.  SHCD mixes deduction skills with a cooperative format, while leading you on a "Choose Your Own Adventure" goose chase.  Can you solve the mystery?  And how quickly?

Players are given a thorough background on the case at hand, and then as a group decide what leads to follow - and those choices are many.  Each lead corresponds to a numbered entry to read (think Tales of the Arabian Nights) and you keep track of how many leads are used.  When the group feels ready, you tackle some questions about the case, each giving a set number of points for a correct answer.  Deduct points for taking too many leads and see how you did!  If you beat 100, you outfoxed Holmes himself!

Delightful and atmospheric, this game's only real drawback is a limited number of these complex cases.  It's just begging to have more researched or translated.  Speaking of which - the English translation can be very rough - you've been warned.

Really fun, and very alternative experience compared to most 'board games'.
The stories are really fun, and very exciting. However, some of the answers or solutions require some silly, illogical jumps of logic, whereas others make you think 'aha' in the most awesome way.

Pros:
Cool mysteries, with very exciting solution paths
Get some chills sometimes when the clues all start to pan out
Nicely made newspapers, cases and directory

Cons:
Some silly solutions
Quite a few typos
Silly stuff like needing to find a street name on the map, which is bloody difficult
Limited play (understandably)

Awesome game, would always play it if others are up for it!

Offers 10 very challenging mysteries, of which I completed only 5. During all these cases my group would frequently get stuck and wonder if we had everything figured out, or if we'd missed something (usually it was the latter). I found most of the cases I played to be difficult and frustrating, and we often got nowhere near the answer. I found it hard to judge when we knew enough about a case to go to the questions; the decision to finally face the questions was normally accompanied by a feeling of exhaustion or resignation, even if we were (usually mistakenly) pretty confident we had a good handle on the case.

There is a pressure to use as few leads as possible, but the questions could be about all sorts of tangential aspects of a case that one might not have encountered despite establishing the big picture. Perhaps having some questions in advance to guide the investigation might make the experience less frustrating, but as it is, looking at the given questions ahead of time would spoil the case.

I can see what the positive reviewers see in the game. There are those who report that they figured out every case and had a great time doing it, so I won't claim that it's broken or too difficult. It just hasn't worked for the the eight or nine people who've played it with me.

Best enjoyed if you fully immerse yourself in this game and forget about trying to get a better score than Sherlock.  You may as well play in this way because once you know "whodunnit" in each of the 10 cases, then there's no replayability.

I agree with Shutupandsitdown's assessment of this game as being the best solitaire game around.  It's funny how bad I am at this game/solving mysteries and still have a blast with it.  It really makes me feel like a detective.

A British mystery fan so this is wonderful. Had the original blue-box version decades ago but that's long out of my collection. Thrilled it's been reprinted. Admittedly, no replayability (hence a 7 rating instead of 8), but it's an absolute classic of this genre of games.

Paragraph-based deduction in which players use limited resources to try and track down the perpetrator of a crime.

I was glad to see this was reprinted after watching the SUSD review. This was a great way to spend a cold Sunday afternoon solving Case 1. We were very pleased with our score of 70. The way the story unfolded as we travelled around various locations in London was very clever. Whilst you are pitting yourself against the detective skills of Holmes this is more of an experience than a game. We will wait for the right moment to savour Case 2.
Case 2 did it on my own failed miserably but in my defence I did rush to finish it before work!!

Definitely not as good as it's made out to be.
The game asks leaps of logic out of you that makes no sense.

As in, for example (with no spoilers) i should think there's a link between a random street performer juggling balls mentionned in a newspaper and a construction worker that's been murdered because they are both french?
If i don't follow that ridiculous far fetched "lead", i will never have the info i need to solve he case...

RATING: 8
This is more of an atmospheric puzzle than a game. It's also a game I remember playing as a teenager and has been out of print until recently. There are no real rules to speak of other than the mechanics of visiting a place/person and looking up the corresponding section in the case file, and it's entirely up to you how long you want to play for - you might finish a case in an hour or play over a couple of nights.

When we play it we're absorbed in the whodunnit, taking notes, drawning connections between suspects on post-its on the wall, reading and re-reading the newspapers for clues (yes, the game has newspapers), trying to decide who did what. If you're a reader, and especially if you like the detective/crime genre, it's well worth a look.

Initial experience of the first case was ok. My wife and I gave it a couple of hours and then sort of wrapped it up. Turned out we had fallen for all the traps that had been set and were completely wrong. It's a game that requires people with a lot of patience and probably 2-4 hours of spare time to commit to each case. Not sure whether to keep or sell.

Decided to sell as my wife and I don't have the time at the moment to spend on each case.  The first play didn't hook us in enough unfortunately.

Sherlock Holmes Consulting detective is an extremely story centered game which will put you against the master of deduction itself. 10 cases to resolve full of intrigue and Victorian age environment immersion. It will make you feel like being right in the spot, living the London aura testing your mind and deduction power.
I personally had high hopes for the game; unfortunately.. they were shattered soon after i started to play the game.
Being exclusively based on story, its language level reflect the age it represents (if you can't understand any single word of this review, by any means don't get the game). The connections between the clues are somehow circumstantial and made me feel not satisfied even with Holmes resolution (i felt there never was a final definitive proof).
In addition this game supports 8 players and, even if it could handle more as there's no real meaning to limit it to 8, it has to be clear that the game is the ONLY reason why you're all sitting at the table and the only interaction you're going to have with the other players is because you're discussing the clues. Any other break, interruption, phone call, etc will only interrupt either the story flow (making you read multiple times the same line) or your line of thoughts forgetting clues or possible leads.
In conclusion this definitely not a bad game and the price is not prohibitive either but you have to know in advance what you're throwing yourself into.

RATING: N/A
Sehr interessantes und weitgehend unbekanntes Spiel des Jahres 1985 das seiner Zeit weit voraus war. Das ist eigentlich gar kein Brettspiel, sondern ein Krimi-Rätsel-Spiel. Es gibt kaum Brettspiel-artige Mechanismen, man muss den Fall wirklich durch Überlegen, einem Stadtplan und einem Adressbuch lösen, indem man verschiedene Orte besucht und nachliest was für Informationen man dort findet. Das Spiel nimmt die Spieler nicht an die Hand, sondern man muss wirklich selbst draufkommen was passiert ist. Das ist sehr ungewöhnlich, aber auch ziemlich herausfordernd, sprich schwer. Wenn man die richtigen Leute am Tisch hat, kann das Knobeln an einem Fall sehr spaßig sein.

Yea, I know it's basically a Choose Your Own Adventure[tm] game, but I just love it. Everything about flipping the binder, tracing a route across  the map, looking at the phone book--I find it all just tremendously entertaining. It also holds a soft spot as this is the game my mom bought for me when I had the chicken pox and was housebound for close to 2 weeks 25-odd years ago.

Players are the Sherlock Holmes street gang, helping the great detective solve ten mysterious cases.  Cooperative story game, where a crime is described, and you go out and "interact" with London by visiting various people and reading out their statements.  Gradually, the plot will be revealed, the clues collated, and several questions asked at the end of the game.  Points are tallied against correct answers to determine a winner.  You are also graded against the great man, who solves the cases with astonishing ease.  Fun game, but not for everyone.  The Ystari reprint is very nice, but with some "interesting" type/font choices.

This game is so enjoyable that even my wife likes to play it.  The only downside is the lack of replayability once you have gone through each of the 10 cases.  But that's still 10 wonderful evenings of fun.  Can't wait to pick up the new "expansion".

Two cases down, and it's been a lot of fun. My wife really enjoys this game. It gives her the thrill of poking around in people's business. For me, I know it's a good game because of the amount of time I spend thinking about each case (and discussing with my wife) after the game is over.

The only negatives for me are: (1) the font. There is a lot of reading in this game, and the font sacrifices clarity for style, and (2) because every word is scrutinized in this game, even a few small editing errors can really cause a lot of frustration.

Played Case 4. Reading back through previous case newspapers is a bit of a drag.

The stories are quite engaging. It is perfect for solo play or for two small groups. I would very much prefer this over a 'murder mystery' party event, hands down... preferably with tea and scones at the ready. Or lots of gin.

Only 1 case in.  I tend to agree with most comments - solving the case can be incredibly fun, but some of the clues seemed to be a pretty big stretch in order to make the association.

An "experience" game that was more fun than I expected.   I wouldn't want to play it very frequently, but it appears capable of hitting that sweet spot when in the mood for a narrative deduction game.   The scoring rewards taking some early risks and penalizes you for being thorough, although the game is designed to support both approaches.    I will be curious to see if subsequent scenarios add to the fun, or if they are just more of the same.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
This is, in my opinion, the quintessential couples game. I love waking up on Saturday/Sunday mornings and sitting down for a coffee and case of Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective. This game makes you think, go at your own pace, do what YOU want to do... and then crushes your confidence as Sherlock states how obvious the crime was. Very much enjoy this game if I have 2-3 hours to sit down and solve!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Not so much a game as it is a Choose Your Own Adventure novel, but much, much better and nuanced. I have only played the first two stories, but both of them I had a little notebook by my side to take notes, I poured over the information from the map and newspapers. It is an experience. The downside is that with that experience and only one right answer once you have the experience it can't be replicated. A year after playing I still have some key bits of info tucked in my brain. So I really hope the expansions get rolling on this (in English) sooner rather than later.

I can't believe this game completely failed to hit my radar on it's first reprinting a few years ago. I've got the latest edition (with reduced typos apparently) and adore it. It's so refreshing to be able to enjoy a murder mystery that you are actually expected to solve without clues.

That said, as you can tell from our scores, we're not going great. In both cases, we completely missed the purpose of the main crime, but managed to get back our points in the secondary questions by nailing them. It's so much fun to have Sherlock point out all the things you've missed, every time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Really one of the best co-operative games I can ever think of playing. Perfect for couples. The cases are interesting and you genuinely feel like Sherlock Holmes as you have little eureka moments together which push you forward. 
    I'm not a fan of having to include all the previously used newspapers for each new case - it just feels like work. Cases are so difficult that reading all the papers thoroughly is a must unless you miss something essential to you being successful. 
    Deciding when to end the game is odd too, you never feel like you've gathered enough intel to be able to answer whatever sherlock is going to ask you in his final confrontation. Go too soon and the questions make you feel like you haven't gotten your moneys worth out of the case (that you will never play again). Go too late and its highly unlikely that your going to beat Sherlock. 
It is still rewarding if you can answer just a few of Sherlock's questions though. 
    Ticks a unique box in my collection and I always enjoy playing.

This was a surprise, this game is AMAZING. There's no board, no cards and no tokens, just a map of London, the 1888 London Directory and a booklet for each one of the ten CASES included. Add pen and paper and you're ready. 

You're gonna investigate clues trying to figure out what happened in S.H.'s style. 
Choose who to speak to and where to go with a high degree of freedom ("uhmm, maybe we should talk with Mr.Ragland's tailor"). Very challenging, well written and rewarding when you are able to connect the dots, and even when you are not. 

If you like the theme and the play style it's an absolute MUST. THE best game for couples. A lot of text, buy it in you own language.

After 1 Play: Immersive gameplay, but some leaps of logic are very frustrating. We're finding it difficult to keep going with this game, but still worth it. Most likely will not get the expansion.

After 5 Plays: Pending

After 10 Plays: Pending

edit: we found out we have the version riddled with mistakes. This explains why some of the case have been so frustrating. We don't know if we want to just power through our copy, buy another, or ditch the game altogether. Concept has been great, but execution has left us with a sour taste more often than not. Downgraded to a 7 until further plays, or a new copy is obtained.

RATING: 6.79
Great great deduction abduction game where you and, ideally, your friends jump right into Victorian era Baker Street, London and act as helpers of Sherlock Holmes in solving 10 mysterious crime cases. The case stories and newspapers are well written and each is different than the other and it gets better and better as you go on. The best part is when you are ready to solve the case and turn to the last page, answer Sherlock's questions one by one and realize how stupid you were! Sometimes it takes us few days to solve the crime, constantly thinking of it during work time, during shopping or in the middle of the TV show.
Worth every penny.

Possibly the best 'paragraph' game? It does have limited replay, although you could get around this by having someone else calculate your end game scores and not actually read you the scenario answers. There's only 10 scenarios but they are really well written. This is a game that really captures the essence of a Holmes story. The game gives you some case information, a news paper, and a map of london with places to visit and people to interview and lets you loose. You will have to make an educated guess to get to the final answer as it isn't handed to you on a plate. The game heavily rewards attention to detail.

An interactive choose-your-own-adventure... which, by their definition, are interactive anyway, but you shut your face!  It's a shame this only lasts so long; once you've solved a case or at least know its outcome, you can't really play it again unless you are somehow able to wipe your memory at will.  The only thing you should know is that it's never lupus.

RATING: 9
Extremely well themed mystery game (despite a slight American smack to the dialogue), with intuitive game play and a skeletal framework of simple rules where the players really can explore and sleuth as they wish within the confines of the games casebook. The casebooks which are stand alone or playable as a series of crimes to solve are progressively more and more tricky and devious. It is NOT easy to win a case even if you draw mostly the right conclusions. Though the built in lack of replay-ability is an obvious flaw its not as bad as it seems. So tricky and detailed are many of the cases after a few years its nigh on impossible to remember them and they can be re-attempted without them being too spoiled.  A very good co-op game even for nongamers.

By now it is certainly cliché to say that you experience this game, more than you play it, but there it is. 

What I love:
-co-op OR competitive!
-thematic - even though the contents of this box are spartan, you do begin to feel like you're in London in the late 19th century.
-challenging - you're going to burn some gray matter with these cases.
-genuinely engaging / immersive - when you're in the middle of a case, it consumes you!
-pride - when you're reading the various statements of the people you meet with as you try to solve the case, opportunity is there to cheat, and to read other little bits, only, that would rob you of your accomplishment!

What I find annoying:
-Obviously there are typos, everyone knows this.
-This was an expensive game ($70 here in Australia), and while the experience has definitely been worth it (so far), it seems hard to justify the cost of a 36 year old game comprised entirely of printed materials of average quality. For that price, I should like to see nicer paper, more artwork, finer construction, larger fonts (more on that next), a bigger map, and is it too much to ask that you include a notebook, since it's absolutely indispensable to game play??? Jesus.
-the font size, and design is just asinine. Reading the directory requires an electron microscope for instance, and that is no exaggeration. Okay, maybe a little. They've had almost 4 (FOUR!) decades to remedy these issues... Lift ya game, mates!
-Sherlock Holmes is a dick. I have never liked how absurd and contrived his powers of deduction are meant to be, give me a break! 

This game's pretty great.

I've played the first three scenarios so far. I like the game, but the third scenario was so messed up with our printing that it became pretty much impossible to get the right answers.

I feel like playing for a score and trying to beat Sherlock is pretty dumb, but it's a good deduction game.

RATING: 10
This game is the first modern tabletop game I bought and after buying and playing ~70 other games, this still stays at the top of my list of Best Games.

I love everything about it:
• map!
• story
• having to think like a detective
• interaction with other players, testing theories with each other, seeing how other people’s different strengths come out in how they solve problems
• simple set up and easy to get started
• leaves you thinking about the cases long after: What could we have done differently?

Minor quibbles include:
• double translation errors in Ystari edition and some mucking about with original cases that don’t necessarily make them more coherent — I’ll blame the translation, which ought to be fixed in the Space Cowboys edition
• Wiggins (who we are supposed to be in the story) doesn’t always ask about things we want to ask about, like clues in the room we’re in, for example

Beating Sherlock is not easy, nor should it be. For me, this game requires a satisfying amount of deduction, induction, and abduction.

This game will not be as enjoyable for:
• people who are unaccustomed to thinking logically and highly rationally
• people who insist on realism
• people who become too fixated with a theory and can’t amend when presented with contradictory information
• people who aren’t in the mood to take in a great deal of information and sift through it all for key clues
• people who don’t enjoy puzzles

Outstanding, very impressive. Minimal rules overhead, well written (the occasional typo excepted) and a wealth of period detail provided. The newspapers in particular are superb; they have obviously been researched very well.

As for gameplay, our first case (The Munitions Magnate) was satisfyingly complex, with plenty of red herrings and blind alleys. The game works very well with two players and with an eye to exploring the case and generating a credible, convincing theory as opposed to racing to out-perform Holmes.

A word on the Ystari case rewrites: we've played a couple of these and in each instance have 'solved' the cases in accordance with the Ystari rewrites. So, thumbs up to Ystari.

I love, love, love:
- solving mysteries!
- getting to study a map and newspaper and interview people around London like Holmes

I dislike:
- ALL. THE. TYPOS. WOW.
- that some of Sherlock's conclusions make no sense in how they're reached
- that the game kind of encourages you to go to extra places that have nothing to do with the mystery so you can answer the questions for points, but the more you move around, the less points you get...

Final verdict: Enjoyable game, but it has no replayability, really, unless you can totally forget the stories and go back maybe after a couple of years to replay them. Glad it was a gift, as this game could easily have been just as good as a free print-and-play.

RATING: 5
Not so much a game in the traditional sense as a co-operative puzzle.

Trying to beat Holmes is really really difficult. The best our group can manage is to actually reach the same conclusions that Holmes did. You must really put yourself in the mindset of the time period and leap to some pretty wild conclusions occassionally, other wise you can find yourself going round in circles. 

I think it would be better if the questions you are trying to answer were presented at the start of the scenario so you know what you are working towards

Really concerned about replayability as I doubt we will ever play the first scenario again without knowing exactly whodunit.

I have only every played this solo, and I'm told it's much better with two because of the discussion and debate that occurs. That's probably true, though already I think the process I go through to note clues and think through the possible scenarios is deeply engaging. It is time-consuming, at least as I play it, and that's meant I've only found time to work through two stories so far. (It bears pointing out that Holmes is a ridiculously loose investigator. I go about it like a prosecutor... He goes about it like a literary character.)

Played the first scenario. Both my wife and I loved it. Though I must admit that I didn't understand the bit about the transcribed telegrams. My lack of understanding of 19th century communication is poor, but this didn't make sense to me. Still, looking forward to the next scenario!

Played the 2nd scenario, enjoyed it even more!

Hopefully the expansions are going to come out soon. At the moment we're going through the cases at the rate of one a week, so in 2 months we'll have to try something else unless Ystari print English editions of the extra cases, here's hoping.

We took our time acquiring this, then finally getting it to the table, and now I wish hadn't waited so long!

It's not a strategy game in the strictest sense; instead, it's a choose-your-own-investigation story where your answer to the case is essentially scored.

Very well done. Very easy to learn. Easy to set down and come back to if you don't want to rush through/play for a long time.

RATING: 6
Even though I only got above 0 pts once, these were somewhat enjoyable to go through.  I liked a little bit of puzzle solving, and seeing Holmes leaps of logic were fun, although sometimes annoying in that Homles always knows when people will be at home instead of at work.  

If you like hard deduction games, and don't treat it like you have to beat Holmes, you'll probably like this.  Treat Case 1 as a tutorial on how to actually play the game.  Your first lead should just about always be to visit the scene of the crime.  I would advise playing this not as a solo like i did, but with 2 so that you can bounce ideas off each other.

If I couldn't make more progress I just skipped to the questions and didn't care about my score.

A couple of things I didn't care for: 
- red herrings or dead ends were fleshed out quite a bit so either you are on the right track, or you are on the wrong track and won't know it until you visit another 4 or 5 leads.
- you'll rarely, if ever, find actual proof for any of the people that did it.  You'll have to make some assumptions that seem to fit the evidence and, boom, that's the answer.  Now, after the fact, Scotland Yard would have to go and visit all of the leads I actually visited to actually build a case to prosecute.
- The standard people that help are a real hit or miss, even when you think they should have something.


Case 1: -5 pts.  I visited 12 more spots than Holmes.  I didn't get why he would visit one of the spots, which, when reviewing after the fact, didn't really give me much more info than I already had.  Other than that, I got the case wrong, but it was a good learning game to understand how tight Holmes works.

Case 2: -10 pts.  I went down the red herring trails of missing jewel and the nephew of one of the Tontine people.  I didn't even think of heading to the theatre.  This case was a little better than the first one with regards to actually working through things in a more step by step manner.

Case 3: skipped as I heard there were some changes that didn't make sense and they changed the killer but didn't update everything so you could reach a different conclusion.

Case 4: -45 pts.  I didn't review the old papers enough to know that the guys were brothers.  Holmes mentions some things that were lost in translation about a park, and he gets info from a telegram that we got by using a lead.

Case 5: -10 pts.  I didn't get the boarding house from backtracking, but the hotel, so I missed out on half the plot.  The date being so important didn't make sense that 5 was the key when the month was different as well, so it could have been 2, because 2 months off.

Case 6: -25 pts.  I guessed at the beginning that 2 of the murders were done by the last guy but then changed it as went along.  I don't like that you waste leads if you don't do things in the right order.  Why would I assume that the captain/first mate are at their homes and not at work at the Shipping company (3 leads).  Without going somewhere else you don't realize that you can just go to the First mate.  Also, there is no reason to assume that the last killer could not have done the first 2 killings.

Case 7: -60 pts.  This was an interesting case but man, was it tough to put the clues together. You are supposed to assume that the a guy whose partner died had a cell mate with the same name as someone that left a personal ad with just first names and then connect his girlfriend to it by finding another story that has the same first name.  Obviously, those two women have to be the same :)

Case 8: 15 pts.  The most interesting case so far, and the one where i actually solved just about all of it.  I didn't gather that the securities were being stolen along the way, and wound up using 14 more leads to get a more solid case.  Holmes conclusions, while I agree with them seemed a bit circumstantial whereas my leads gave me more hard proof.  There was a timing issue with Moran in that it said he was in 2 places around the same time.  I think it was a misprint as it wasn't brought up again.

Case 9: 0 pts.  
Nitpicks about this case:
- Holmes decides he wants to visit 2 out of the 3 staff, which are the only ones that provide info.  How does he know that the 3rd won't know anything?  
- Without visiting 1 person at the beginning I missed out on names that would have clued me in on what the list of sales were.  
- They made a big point of saying there was nothing in the guys stomach but yet a bite was missing from the biscuit.  I thought this meant he hadn't taken a bit at all which through me off.
- Holmes mentions that Jasper should know more about something at the beginning and then he doesn't even use him.

Case 10: -25 pts
I guessed early that there was a Thomas Crowne Affair thing going on and Norris let someone in.  I picked up that Cole was involved, although Holmes conclusions aren't supported by any facts other than Norris/Cole had met (which Holmes doesn't know since he didn't go to the bar).  He assumes it's all fakes because there was some non-old paint which didn't discount that the other paintings could have been real.  This case, while interesting, seemed to have a lot more assumptions on Holmes part.

Muy buen juego de deducción, con una ambientación y producción espectaculares. Los casos son bastante complejos y casi siempre esconden datos que se nos escapan, lo que le da una profundidad tremenda que permite jugarlo de manera más sosegada aún. Cada caso tarda en resolverse entre 3 y 4 horas, y siempre queda la sensación de que aún podrían dedicársele un par de horas más para atar cabos sueltos. Muy recomendable.

Even though some of the cases are a little frustrating, this game offers an experience like no other.  This game feels almost like Myst, you're left to your own deductive devices to solve the crime, the game itself will offer you no assistance whatsoever.  

At the beginning of a case, you're given some details of a crime, and then you're thrown out on the streets and told to go explore London and solve it.  The game only moves forward when you actively make a decision to go somewhere and talk to someone.  You can take as long as you want to ponder what you've learned and hypothesize.  The case only ends when you think you have enough information to deduce what happened.  

While solving a case and getting a high score feels great, even getting a case completely wrong and earning an abysmally low score can still be fun.  Once, we got so lost during a case that it became a disastrously bad experience we couldn't wait to be over, but then we wanted to go right into the next case and keep going.

RATING: 7
I went into the first scenario thinking we'd need to build a waterproof case, especially after Holmes' admonishment to stick to the facts in the introduction. Of course, that meant we visited far too many places and talked to too many people and still didn't have a smoking gun at the end. Because the game doesn't have any. It's not so much about collecting solid evidence as it is about building a house of cards with just a few tidbits of information.

Obviously, we adapted accordingly on later cases. Some of them require huge leaps of faith, some solutions seem a little far-fetched, and at least for the first few cases we never got anywhere near Holmes' scores but the game was always greatly entertaining regardless. And that's kind of the point.

The only downside is the limited replayability. It's pretty much one and done.

I don't now what to think about it. The game was fun - BUT we played it a while and somwhere we thought we had some good ideas what the solution could be but had no idea how to get sure about it. And we still had some strange facts we had no clue how to explain them. 
After some time we gave up and read the 'mastersolution'. The result was: We had every piece of information the game would offer us and we supposed the right solution - but we wasn't sure because there was some other possible explanation what happened. The 'mastersolution' ignored any other possible solution and didn't even mentioned some strange facts we couldn't explain.  
So in the end we were somewhat disappointed because we had to many open questions...

I think I will play it again in the hope the other adventures/cases will be better - but if not I will rate down this game to a '3' (or even less)

RATING: 8
I originally awarded the game a 9. I had to drop it to 8 because of the mess the authors made of case 3. Case 3 is not solvable in the form it is delivered with the game. Most of the case points to a different culprit, and leave the intended culprit without motive and with an alibi for part of the crime. It was shown that this is the result of the authors changing the guilty party from the original release, but forgetting to make all necessary updates to the English case book (while they did make the correct updates to other languages). And the worst is: they did not even bother to fix this for the second edition! Shame. Such a marvelous game, and it is partly ruined by bad editing.

Of course, this is not so much a "board game" as an interactive story.  There is a scoring system, but it's a terrible idea to follow it too much to the letter as it encourages you solve the case quickly and try to do as well as Sherlock Homes (who always scores 100 points).  This means that you miss a lot of the flavour (and this whole game is flavour) if you try to solve the case too quickly without visiting interesting (if not possibly vital) areas.  As long as you play in role and don't try to "game" the game by visiting every single bloody location, then you should be fine.  It was a fun experience!  Some of the narrative is a bit heavy-handed, but enough fake-twiddling of one's fake-moustache and bad accents can get you through even the most over-wrought phrases.

This "game" is more an activity than a game.  It involves keeping detailed notes of the scenario you read out of several sources and then trying to think like Sherlock Holmes.  Don't try to use logic to solve the case - think like Sherlock to solve the case.  There's no board game here, there's no board, no components and no game.

Interestng game, but solving a case is suspicious.  The non player characters seem to be available to information you are not, and the game guides itself.  Some conclusions seem outlandish, and Holmes is unbeatable.  Limited replay due to having only a limited number of cases.

Amazing game that my wife and I like playing collaboratively. We don't even try to beat Sherlock and just knock at each and every door we can think of.
The only downside I can think of is that it is not really using the map, or very little. Also, some cases left us thinking.. 'Mmmmmh, not sure I completely buy into that one..'
Finally, it would have been great to have some kind of Legacy aspect between the cases, each case having an impact on the next one. Or at least having a growing story in the background which I thought they were trying to do with Moriaty at some point..

I've only played through a couple cases, and if they are any indication of the rest, they are ingenious (meaning it took me many, many interviews to find the clues, and I often was wrong anyway).  However, there is little replayability.  Maybe if I get a bunch of whodunnit lovers over, we'll give it another try, but I don't want to waste them on myself.

RATING: 6.5
Sherlock Holmes choose-your-own-adventure style story-based murder/mystery.  10 mysteries included that take place in the iconic 1880s London, plus many player inspired mysteries here on BGG and more official mysteries are in the works.  Sometimes tricky, and sometimes just leaves you scratching your head.  Yasari version is riddled with typos and unclear information connections (not sure if the later is intensional, but annoying nonethless).  Can be played solo, but IMO for more deduction problem solving fun it's best with multiple players.

I know that one day I'll solve all the cases and the game will become a cardboard paperweight.
But for now it is a unique and challenging play experience. There really is nothing like it, and every case has thrown at least one of the people playing it off on a hunt for red herrings.
Try it out if you can find a cheap sale on Ebay or a trade. Then give it to your friends so the fun can live on in another generation.

UPDATE - I took a break for over a year, and went back to some of the cases.  I sort of remember many details, but it's still fun to figure out again.  And I can act as the reader for another player while they figure it out, which is more of a blast than it sounds like it should be.

Almost more of a book game than a board game, SHCD is a wide-open investigation of words. Study physical clues, interrogate people, and consider circumstance as you formulate your theory on whodunnit to best Sherlock, who always seems to need fewer clues. If you don't mind a game with a 10-case expiration date and a heavy reliance on Western and historical knowledge, you should enjoy this. An excellent co-op for 2.

A superb game that plays unlike almost any other game you've played. The most significant negative is that the misprints can severely impact your ability to actually complete the cases.

Bought September 2014. Rating based on two plays.

Played through case 1 of [thing=2511][/thing] with six friends sitting around an open fire, which I think is probably the perfect atmosphere, and was thoroughly satisfying. Solved the case (cooperatively) and scored 75 points versus Sherlock's 100 (or 85 with less strict scoring).

Case 2: oh dear, -5 points (15 with less strict scoring) versus Sherlock's 100. This one was a bit more opaque. We had the right general idea, but couldn't work out where to go to get more detailed information.

It's more of a sandboxy Choose Your Own Adventure story than a game. The cleverly layered narrative gives it an edge for me over other storytelling games I've tried (I'm looking at you, [thing=34119][/thing]).

I'm the biggest Sherlock Holmes fan I've ever met.  It took all of my effort to not buy this for myself as it was an ideal Christmas gift and no one ever knows what to give me.  My brother and I have been combining wits and are working through the cases together.  The scoring system is busted in that you're scored for your ability to answer questions in Part Two, but Holmes doesn't bother with those.  You lose points for taking extra turns, but you can't answer Part Two questions without taking extra turns.  Without paying attention to the scores, the game is perfect.  I love it.  It's amazing.  The more thought you put into the case the more enjoyable it is.

UPDATE:  Case #3 is total bullsh!t. There isn't enough evidence for a reliable deduction.

SUMMARY: It has a few flaws, but overall it's a winner.  Just loses some points for not being replayable.

UPDATE: I believe this to be the most thematic game in the entire BGG database.  It's the most exciting and memorable gaming experience I've had in a long time.  Fantastic game!

Get over it. 
You're not as smart as you think you are. 
I know you. You're the one who watches CSI shows while shouting advice at the screen. You think your Rick freakin' Castle, or Dr.Gregory "get bent" House. 
You think you know everything.
Well, you don't. 
Because Sherlock Holmes knows everything, and if you want to take a lesson in humility, just sit down next to him and talk your way through the solution you came up with for one of the mysteries in this game.
ME: "So, I began to think the deceased was wrought with overwhelming guilt, and in a final act of contrition, killed himself with one of his military collectibles."
SHERLOCK: "That's remarkable.  Remarkably wrong! Aside from being a mouth-breathing moron, you've also managed to twist the evidence in this case into a tale of sheer fantasy. Shall I have a carriage come round for you? I honestly wonder how you find your way home at night."

Yeah, it's like that.

This is the BEST story-telling game you will play. All others will fall short and leave you wondering why you bothered picking them up in the first place.
You can teach someone to play this game in 2 minutes. "Read the initial mystery, now follow a lead either by looking at the map of London, or checking the included directory of persons and places and obtain a code. Look that code up and read the next clue. Then keep going till you think you've solved the mystery."
That's it. 
As simple as it is, you feel like a REAL detective. You don't play this game so much as you run an actual investigation. You decide with whom you will speak, when to visit the crime scene (if at all), and when to involve other professionals like the medical examiner, or Scotland Yard. It's all up to you, but things are left wonderfully vague enough for you to make leaps in logic that actually pay off, or send you down the wrong trail.
That's another brilliant part of this game: wrong trails are equally supported with information. So if you think the murder suspect killed himself, you'll find information to support that- even though it's wrong, but it's your fault for not paying attention to the real clues. 
There is an included lecture in the instruction booklet from Sherlock Holmes who warns you to not let theories twist facts, and he's right. If nothing else, this game could be presented as a course in information management, or discernment in logical thinking.

As you follow each lead, you realize that getting to the truth isn't easy, especially if you want to beat Holmes at solving the case, which you can do.
Maybe.
If you're good. I mean VERY good.
If you keep your logic sound, and let the facts speak for themselves, occasionally, you'll get lucky. When you follow the right path of leads, the solution presents itself in a neat little package, but there are other ancillary mysteries going on, and when you get to the questions at the end of the mystery you realized that you missed something. Yes, you did, but now it's too late. And Sherlock is sitting in the parlor, ready to discuss his solution and compare it with yours. And you know he's going to make you feel like a third grader.

I love this game, and can't wait to play it with a group. Oh, didn't I tell you?
You can play this game solo.
That's right, just you and the case book and a few resources. It's the best solo experience I've had in gaming. 
Not into the lone-wolf thing? How about a game to play with your spouse or partner?  Here it is.
Get this game before it's gone, because I don't think it will make another release. 
Yes, this game is actually a re-release of the original game that came out in the 80's. There was also a very badly executed "Full motion Video" version of it for computer systems back in the day. I never played it, but I did see a demo version. It looked bad.

On the negative side: There are glaring TYPOS in the rulebook and throughout the mystery books. It's horrible how this oversight makes the game look like a quickly-printed mess that didn't get even a basic proof read. 
VERY LAZY. Holmes wouldn't have put up with that, and certainly not Watson. Shame on you game publisher. This game deserves nothing but a stellar package, and you blew it.

A great way to make yourself feel stupid.  The game simply provides you with a murder, some clues and a directory to follow them up with.  After much wandering, debating and head scratching you land upon a solution and turn to the back of the case book to see ho you've done.  This is when it's revealed that you not only got the murderer wrong, missed a number of glaringly obvious clues and failed to follow up on any side cases, but also that Sherlock Holmes solved the whole thing in 5 minutes.

Fantastic. Players are given the starting scenario for a mystery and then allowed to explore freely in any number of directions-- visit the crime scene, interview a suspect, check the paper for relevant stories. After you believe you've solved the crime, you answer questions and are scored on not only your accuracy, but the number of clues it required.

The writing is excellent and perfectly matches the style of the original Holmes stories. The game play is reminiscent of the old "Choose Your Own Adventure" books, but with much more free-form choices.

Very thematic and engrossing. I would rate it a 10 except for the lack of replayability. There are 10 scenarios. And you get 10 plays. Well worth it anyway. And an expansion is coming out. It doesn't hit the table as often as it might. Partly because of the replay issue, but also because it needs a long time NAD your wits about you. Not a game to play before bed. Thoguh we have tried.

My favorite case is probably #2, but each makes for a very different kind of adventure.

I have played 8 cases and I am done. Love Sherlock Holmes, hate this game. Why? Two of the cases are completely broken. The solution references evidence that simply does not exist, and yet is necessary to draw the correct conclusion. If I never have a chance to draw the correct conclusion why am I even playing? It is not like I can house rule or fix the game in some way. Once its done its done. I have the first Ystari printing if you are wondering. I don't want to post spoilers about it here, if you do want details about the broken cases PM me.

This is very, very sloppy. How did someone at Ystari not catch this? The only way is if the game wasn't playtested at all after translation. A shame really because the game does have potential.

Solved the first case, although with an almost negative score. Very well put together and a lot of fun. First case took us around 3.5h, expect subsequent cases to take a little less as we lost some time figuring out how to best tackle the problem at hand in this first run.

RATING: 7
It's a bit like these adventure games books, except that you access the snieppets to be read from a map.  The absence of time is a bit unsettling in the stories, but then you have a greater sensation of freedom than in an adventure book.
Of course it's a game for those able to immerse themselves in a story, because the game system in itself is nearly nonexistent.

RATING: 8
Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective is like being on the case in the presence of the greatest detective ever, Sherlocke Holmes. You have as many opportunities to collect evidence, make meaning and connections, and build a water-tight case: who, when, where, and why. After all is said and done, Sherlocke solves it faster, more efficiently, and without fault - making it seem as though you might as well have been eating paste the whole time.

Brilliant experience game that sucks you right in -- a great opportunity to sit with a sifter of brandy by dim light, whether alone or in the company of friends and loved ones, sleuthing. 

The aesthetics of the reprint are quite lovely as well.

I like this one but it is much more like reading a book than playing a game with friends.  I consider it a one person game (which you can do) and not a group effort.  Sort of a reading man's 221 Baker Street.

RATING: 6
Played the first case.  It was difficult but now knowing how it works I am very looking forward to trying other cases.  Very simple system that works well other than the fiddliness of looking up where everything is located.

Tried the first case, spent four hours lovingly exploring every detail. Got the killer wrong, loved every minute. Even the spelling mistakes & mis-translations can't detract from it...

RATING: 7
This game is theme through & through.. if you care for that you'll love it, if you love crunchy mechanics not so much.
Me being an ex-role-player i really enjoy these cases, especially the victorian tongue-in-cheek flavour texts.

The winning condition is a bit weird. If you're really going for the high-score you try to follow the least amount of leads.. wich results in you seeing only a small portion of the whole case.

Other than that, great production.

(oh and apparently they didn't fix any of the sometimes case-breaking typos from the first edition, that's just negligent.)

This is an excellent game.  I don't always want to  play it, so I'm kind of hampered in by the BGG rank guidelines.  I will say this however.  If you can guarantee that all of your cases will be done/completed/solved with the same crowd, you will have a blast with this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A hard but really fun game. The cases are tough to solve and it's very difficult to crack them in limited time. I like to play this co op with my wife and we take a good time to go through the clues before we go about to the ending.

The only drawback is the limited number of crimes to solve!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
1 - 8 players

This is a deduction game where you are trying to solve the mystery in as few as steps as Sherlock was able to.  There are newspaper entries to peruse, a city map, a directory, and a book telling you what happens when you go talk to various people.  Sort of a "choose your own adventure" in a way but you can always solve the mystery eventually even though it might take you many more steps than Sherlock.  Not something I would like to play often but I enjoy it for something different.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This rating is based on one play, and one particular variety of experience... This game stays with you when you leave the table. My SO and I took a break in the middle of the first case for about a day or two, and we both would consistently chat about the case, its details, the questions we still had. Fantastic game. Really gives a strong sense of an open world structure and player agency unlike anything else Ive ever played.

An adult's version of a "Choose your own adventure" book. Very enjoyable if you enjoy mysteries/Sherlock Holmes, and very challenging.

Edit: After several cases, raising to a 9. Have gotten the wife and in-laws to play and have had a great time, despite not having a lot of success. I would expect it is a solid solo game as well.

Edit: Played through them all. Still a great game, but some cases were better than others. I think a few mistakes or translation issues slipped through.

Once I got past the rules and the initial case description and first couple leads, the story began playing in my head and I felt like I was inside one of my favorite mystery novels. It was honestly a bit of an adrenaline rush as I pieced it together and went to the Solutions page (mostly) confident in my answers. Scored 45 pts in Case 1 (4/2b), so not too shabby in my opinion. 

It felt like a cross between reading an excellent mystery novel with a Choose Your Own Adventure story. Really really really excellent game. I wish I could rate it an 11.

Pretty much THE game to play if you like Sherlock Holmes, it sets you in competition with the mighty detective to solve the 10 mysteries in the box. Pretty abstract, and not really a 'game' so much as a narrative puzzle, it is an immensely satisfying experience.

RATING: 6
This game does a great job in making you feel like a detective, trawling through the paper for clues then chasing up leads in an old school London. I think it misses the mark a bit in that it is very difficult and often seems to withhold information unnecessarily. However it's hard not to enjoy playing it as you get swept up in the case. Sadly the catharsis of a satisfying end has rarely come along after a case, often you are just left frustrated. Perhaps a Sherlock Holmes Junior consulting detective would be more my speed...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This game is amazing. It bridges the gap between theme and real life to form a game in which you really are solving a mystery, not just playing a game in which you solve a mystery. (Granted, the mystery isn't real.) The other joy of this game is that it's incredibly challenging, which for me means that it can grow an incredible amount as you further your understanding of how to go about the game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is my rating after the first three cases based upon averaging out the score for each:

- First case: 9. Really fun, well written, interesting clues to follow that definitely all have their own twists and turns but with the true crime becoming evident very organically and in a way that gives you that "a ha!" feeling.

- Second case: 7. Fun, but with some rather confusing/misleading clues that I wonder were written poorly due to translation issues. Still an interesting plot to uncover that definitely made sense as more evidence was uncovered, albeit in not quite as interesting a way as the first case. 

- Third case: 1. Awful. Horribly misleading clues, nonsensical plot, not fun to play at all. At various times felt like every single lead was being followed, and nothing was becoming more clear. Had the "true" plot figured out early based on a hunch, but after following leads to confirm, it didn't seem like anything but the hunch corroborated the theory, only to find out it indeed was the correct conclusion. I would practically say this case was broken, except for that it CAN be figured out...so long as you ignore a lot of evidence to the contrary for no good reason, and only focus on the snippets that the writers apparently wanted you to focus on? One of the more frustrating experiences I can think of. And due to the nature of some of the clues and case conclusions in previous cases, there was no way of knowing if something was being missed, or if something just wasn't there. 

I have since read that case 3 is infamous in this collection, but am pretty disappointed to learn that the most recent version (which is what I have) was supposed to "fix" problems like those that were encountered. It's disappointing to think that at least 1/10th of the game is just a complete waste of time.

Hopefully the rest of the cases trend more towards the first two, but even so, it's still disappointing to have wasted so much time and effort on something that was designer error/publishing negligence.

At the time of this writing, I have only played the first case for this game, but wow!  A deduction game where you are in the world of Sherlock Holmes.  Technically I think you play the part of one of Holmes men and not Holmes himself.

The open-endedness of the game is its strength.  You are given a paragraph of what happens at a site and that is it.  Based upon what you read and what you currently know you need to decide which location to visit.  You can become easily stuck if you do not see a location in your directories or do not think a location is mentioned and thus do not look for it.

Notes are mandatory for the game as are the occasional leaps of logical faith.

-----
Editted: Having now played half a dozen times, I have increased my ranking to a 9.  This is a perfect game for a group of friends to gather to solve the crime.  I found it is best not to worry about the scoring in it and enjoy the adventure in front of you...and to realize how very much you are unlike the famous detective.

Definitely a sometimes game, something I really have to be in the mood for to play. Though when I'm in the mood for it it's pretty great. Definitely a bit wonky though; anyplace you go to follow a lead has a static set of information you learn. As a result if you go to a particular place with the intention of learning one thing it might just not get brought up if it's not something the game considered and instead you learn some other stuff that maybe you weren't on the trail of. If and when this happens it really takes you out of the game. I think in general there are a few things like this that are inherent limitations of trying to do something like this with a static finite amount of information available, but overall it's an ambitious idea and it mostly works.

I have a 1st. Edition (3-Ring Binder Version). The game is probably the best attempt to have players solve real misteries.

Unfortunately this gem can be played just once, the game has absolutely zero replay value.

With the right group, this is a blast!  It's basically a choose-your-adventure coop game where the group is presented with a mystery and then you get to try to solve it.  You've got a map of London with many many places numbered (and a directory of who lives where) plus a list of special informants.  You decide what location to go to and then look it up in the mystery book and read what happens.  There is no chance element.  You are trying to figure it out in the least number of visits.  When you think you have it, you go to the Master Detective and he asks a series of questions.  If you can answer them, you win!  If he asks you questions about people you've never heard about, then you get a sinking feeling.  :)  If you get stuck you can also visit him for clues.  The mysteries are a good level of difficulty and with interesting twists.  Very atmospheric and fun!

RATING: 4
Pretty fun, and a completely unique experience. The font and translation are bad-but-functional and there are a lot of typos. Some of the solutions are kind of dumb (I'm looking at you case #3). Make sure you get the errata. 

I suggest playing against each other rather than cooperatively, as cooperatively can be frustrating when you don't agree on how to proceed. This could have been a 9 or better with better writing and a few tweaks.

Edit: after playing more, this game is ruined for us by the pervasive errors and bad design of the cases. We're no longer willing to sit and agonize over a case for hours, not knowing whether we're just missing something, or if the solution is something stupid that no human would think of, or if some vital typo/error is throwing us off. Ugh, this game should be a 10. Instead it is a 4.

A fascinating hybrid between a boardgame, a tabletop RPG and a "choose your own adventure" book. At its best, it is a perfect experience. However, the list of things that could make it go wrong is pretty long: too big of a group, impatient or bossy players, cheaters, a noisy setting or other distractions, and so on.

***UPDATE***
My rating is more indicative of the game concept and experience in general, some scenarios are deserving of less praise.

RATING: 7
Theme: Sherlock Holmes
Gameplay: Engrossing choose-you-own-adventure presentation of solving Victorian mysteries.
Components: EXCELLENT but for some errors that utterly destroy a few of the cases in YSTARI edition.
Replayability: None, once you have completed all 10 cases you'd have to wipe your memory to play again.
Rulebook: Good.

I have spent many evenings playing this delightful game. Usually of course, I have a general idea of the solution to a given case after having visited a couple *dozen* locations. Then looking at the solution, not only does my theory turn out to be wrong, but Holmes demonstrates how the case could have been solved decisively in three moves. Arghh!

The new Ystari version looks nice. The font used in the directory is almost unbearably small and hard to read, though, and the use of a faux-handwriting font for the case book is ill-chosen also.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (May 2013)

Good game experience. This is not a game for everybody but it certainly appeals to me. The game can be short or long depending on how well do you play it, the game components are great! The old newspapers are great to read :D, the atmosphere is very well done. Very novel mechanics (or at leasrt very different from what I’m accustomed to).

On the bad side, the language barrier is great for some players (if only one or two players know English they have to carefully read and convey the clues to the others), also I think the game is best played as a 2 or 3 player game, with more I feel the game begins to bog down as everyone discuss. I don’t like that we are supposed to solve the mystery with only 4 or 5 clues (as Sherlock would have done it),  I feel most of the game is wasted if we play this way, I would like to explore the world at heart because it is very detailed (I shudder at the effort required to do this and it is a shame to waste it), that is, I don’t want to optimize the result for this game (winning it in 3 steps), I want the experience. As the game only comes with 10 cases I don’t think I will buy it, the game replayability is practically zero. 

For now I’m rating it a 6.0 because I feel the game has potential, but I didn’t fully enjoy my only play. 

I remember I had a PC game with this title, perhaps the cases are the same? I was too young to play it correctly and I don’t remember, however I want to buy it for the iPad so I can play it solo (and I don’t want to play solo games ever, still Sherlock Holmes calls to me).

Bottom line, I want to play this game again (I even requested a second play after the first one but I was shot down), I think the rating will go up with more plays, but only If I’m allowed to really explore the game. This is the only game I had have urges to play solo.

This is pretty much what I want in a murder mystery game. Give me the details, let me follow leads in whatever order I wish, when I think I know the answer, I'll tell you. Of course, in a game like this you can only play a case once, so replayability is shit, but with 10 cases this will do nicely. We've only played once, and did okay on the questions (only missed one 10 pointer), but lost a ton of points by following like 20 leads. Look forward to trying to improve on that with the next case.

Fantastic game.  The writing of the mysteries is great (and convincingly written in Conan Doyle's style) and this is a great game to bring out with a small group of your closest friends in a cabin in the mountains; a fire going and a whisky in hand.  The mysteries are challenging without feeling impossible and, whilst you hate Sherlock Holmes when he explains how he solved the mystery, it in no way feels like he had an unfair advantage over you.

Collect clues through reading and solve crimes in as few turns as possible. You can work together to solve or compete to solve it more quickly than the others. Each turn you can look up a person or location mentioned in an earlier clue and hope to get something useful. The game is about deduction, so you will find scant hard evidence here. 

Very well-written. Amazingly thought out and put together. A game unlike any other. Replayability is low and occassionally passages will assume you've learned something you haven't, but these are minor quibbles. If it sounds like a fun idea to you, then you won't be disappointed.

Very unique, clever idea, and the recent reprint is of high quality. It's an excellent family or party game (assuming everyone is an adult though; likely too taxing for kids), and many people who loathe to play board games love to give this one a go.

I would rate it higher, but unfortunately there are a lot of typos in the new reprint, and some of the cases are "broken" in that they require ridiculous leaps of deduction. If five bright adults (including a medical doctor, a pharmaceutical chemist, a classical composer, and a programming language developer) spend nearly 6 hours on a single case and only get one minor question right at the end, I think something is a bit off.

But still, it's the journey that matters the most. Even though the endings are rather anticlimactic and sometimes blatantly unfair, the process is still great fun.

RATING: 8
This is a difficult game to rank, because there really isn't a lot of game in it. There is a great experience in playing the game, but scoring is really not necessary and collecting the information necessary to score just gets in the way of the experience. After a few plays, I have decided to not worry about scoring and just follow the leads in the case and enjoy the story that unfolds.
It is also difficult to rank this game due to the absolutely miserable production quality of this game. The concept is great, the potential endless, but the game falls short. As it is, I have ranked this game too high for its quality because it is rare in concept and I want it to be so good.
The material quality is OK, but the graphic design is horrible and the editing of all textual materials is even worse. This would be bad enough in a game that is only dependent on these materials for conveying the rules, but in this case, the text is the game. Fortunately, several BGG users have uploaded fixes to some of the errors in the cases (which, in the instance of Case 3 would otherwise make the case completely unsolvable). However, beyond the material errors in the text, there are so many typos and the text so unreadable (light script on a mottled, brown background) that the narrative is destroyed. The map of London is similarly difficult to read, so any time that a case requires searching for street names, we often end up skipping that part of the investigation. 
It is a shame that the publisher, knowing that this was a highly anticipated reprint, spent so little effort in its production. Honestly, shame on Ystari. I am not one to accuse a publisher of a "money grab," but seriously, this game has the worst quality control of any game that I own. It was obviously just thrown into the market because there was a demand for it.

Some games are suttle in the way they draw you in.  Consulting Detective has that quality.  The rules are simple, solve the crime using any means possible.  The nice thing about this game is it's open endedness to solve the crime.  There is no right or wrong way, but you better use some brainpower to put all the facts together.  Your way to weigh winning or losing is comparing your turns it took to solve the crime compared to Shelock's.  I have loved this game since I purchased it back in 83'.  If you can find a copy, its worth a try.  I think 2 expansions plus a huge case that was used for a competition was produced for the game!

When I first read about this game I thought I wouldn't enjoy it at all. I play a lot of euro games and this game is nothing of the sort. When my FLGS got a demo copy I decided to give the game a proper try and was surprised by how fun the experience was. I played the first mystery solo and attempted the second one with my partner. We both enjoyed the game and found working together to be a lot of fun. However, I wouldn't want to play this with more than two.

The game content is extremely well conceived. The work that went into making each mystery is staggering. Clues and story weaved together and carefully portioned out along with red herrings and secondary lines of investigation. When you take a step back after the mystery is solved it's hard not to be impressed with the quality of it all. 

My one nit-pick at this point is the font used. The hand writing script is hard to read and likely the cause of several typos found in the text. It does make it harder to accidentally read clues you aren't entitled to, but I would have preferred a more mundane typeface.

It's taking us a couple of nights per mystery now since the holidays are over.  But this prolonging of the game gives you a day to trouble over the details, your decisions and any new approaches come nightfall and the map is placed back on the table.  The first mystery was tough, second we rocked, we're lost in the middle of the third...

I was very excited for this one. This looked like the type of game where my group could just hang out on a couple of couches and discuss what was going on in the case (while accurately following the rules) and eventually come up with a solution. By the end of the game, we realized we should have spent much more time and discussion with each individual case chapter before moving on to the next turn. Next time we play, we'll sit around a table and I'll make copies of the main case introduction and possibly the whole case book to hand out to all participants.

The amount of detail that went into development of this murder mystery is outstanding. The only game that I can compare it with in this respect is [gameid=788]. It's astonishing that there even are different ways to solve a case. It's not without edges, e.g. locations where investigators ask questions you don't know anything about because you missed an important location before. Nonetheless, with the right group this is highly entertaining and at least the Franckh German version which went on to win the Spiel des Jahres 1985 has a gorgeous retro design to add to the pleasure.

It's almost hard to even look at this as a "game". As a big fan of Holmes, being able to dive into a myriad of stories (that feel like they could have been penned by Arthur Conan Doyle himself) with a group of friends and experience them together in a choose your own adventure style was a dream.  I love how this game encourages out of the box thinking (just like Holmes' stories) and sometimes the answer to a complex riddle is right in front of your face the whole time. But the immersion the components bring (like the newspapers, for instance) can easily send you down a hundred different rabbit holes, which is absolutely brilliant.  Eventually we stopped playing with the objective of beating Holmes (though we've come pretty close).  Wonderful game that could really have some fantastic longevity with more expansions.

Know what to expect going into this. It is deduction but is not always black and white. You can never be 100% certain like you can in Clue or Sleuth. Requires thinking outside the box and coming to a "best guess" with as few leads as possible. Yes, Sherlock is a cheater and never follows a bad lead, but he's Sherlock and known for this anyway. Prioritize solving the case and enjoying the story over your score. Even if you can beat him once that is a tremendous success! Played with gf and seems to be a perfect couples game. I would not want to play this with more than 2 or 3 folks, however. Overall, I'm blown away by this game! Also - buy the Space Cowboys version and save yourself lots of trouble.

This is a great game for people who like investigating and solving mysteries. It's a little lacking in production value, though. The story and clues and newspapers are all well-written. 

However, the clue lookup mechanic is a drawback as it's difficult NOT to see clues other than what you mean to look up.  Owners may wish to print out some sort of individual clue cards, perhaps using a business card printing app or something like that.  Thus, when you visit a location you can see just that clue.

Very impressive RPG-style Sherlock Holmes game. A lot of detail went into each scenario, and the map, newspapers and directory fit very well in making one feel as though they are exploring London in the 1800s. The option of visiting locations completely unrelated to the case (like the Diogenes Club for Mycroft's advice) are a welcome treat to those who are familiar with Holmes' world.

The game is quite heavy though, and requires players to be in the mood to read and think. Not recommended for light play.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Of the things you might expect from a paragraph-based Sherlock Holmes game, Consulting Detective does at least one thing pretty well: the writing and characterization is colourful, varied, occasionally amusing, and just about the right length. When it comes to deduction, however, the logical path you're expected to take through these cases is anything but rigorous. If not sooner, this will become obvious when you're reading Holmes's exposés, which largely account for the facts of each case, and don't overtly contradict them, yet don't actually prove much, depend on assumptions, extrapolations and conjecture, and blatantly rely on information not covered in the selection of paragraphs Holmes is said to have used. Consequently, the initially appealing prospect of solving a case "just like Holmes" is a red herring, and truly shooting for such a feat means depriving yourself of reading and puzzling over the majority of clues before arbitrarily deciding on a hypothesis - which is likely to be incomplete anyway, given that you don't know beforehand exactly what you're expected to account for, adding to the impossibility of a solution that is both rapid and conclusive. So what we have here is a nice piece of creative writing, even a decent brain teaser, but don't expect a well-defined board game where the proper use of logic is rewarded, and don't be surprised if the end of each case leaves you feeling you want to punch Holmes in the gut.

We've only played one case so far and it was ok.  My wife and I will also read Dr Quicksolve type mystery books on road trips so we thought it would be cool to have a board game with a similar idea, but more in depth.  I guess I expected a little more to it, maybe more board game like, opposed to just reading.  Oh well, perhaps things will become more interesting and I'll re-evaluate it then.

My only other criticism is that you have to solve the mystery in the same or less steps than Sherlock.  That makes the solving a little more challenging, but at the same time I kind of like taking some extra steps to hear more of the story.

Among the first games I ever owned, I gave it away when I downsized and moved house. I'd played a few games but it never really sparked. I found that the solutions offered by "Holmes" consistently made unjustified leaps in logic or excluded alternative interpretations of facts without explanation - and that annoyed me. So I gave it away without regret.

But then when it came back into print, I bought another copy. Why? Nostalgia? Who knows?

An old classic with a new face.  This printing is tops.  A cooperative (or solo) game where you try to beat Sherlock Holmes at solving several cases by using clues from the casebook, newspapers, a register of London's people and businesses, and a map.  One to make you scratch your head and try to figure out the cases.  I love this style and wish more games were like it.  The weakness is obviously that once you play through the cases, you know the outcome, so it is pretty much a play it once and toss it type of game.  There is no replayability.  That doesn't stop me from loving it, though.  I just want more like this.  :-)

シャーロックホームズ　１０の怪事件
これこそ、推理ゲーム。昨今流行りの脱出ゲームなんかとは比較にならない。
地図と新聞は推理には必須。アマゾン等で欠けたものが販売されているがやめた方がいい。ボードゲームのジャンルかどうかは関係なく、とにかく良い。消去法で解決する他の推理物のボードゲームよりもはるかにいい。ソロでじっくりと自分のペースで解きたい人にはぴったり。
日本語版は4部作だが、4作目は未入手。

Unique game.  Not really a game, more of a set of complex riddles. Don't take these murder who-dunnit cases lightly.  Get out a pad of paper. Take notes.  Draw up a timeline. Build logic diagrams. Study the map. Each case takes a few hours of study. Even then, you will smack your head when you read the solution and see all the clues that you missed!

A very impressive little system, particularly the fact that the book-of-paragraphs doesn't have a single "if you have learnt X, turn to page Y" redirect, they all just play out as written and rely on the scoring to discourage entirely speculative visits. Some mild non sequiturs and awkwardly presented clues, but no worse than a watchable TV detective series - forming your own theories is always the fun thing there, even if you're wrong because of a red herring, and it's great to have a game that lets you actively explore that.

I wish there were more games likes this. You will need lots of scratch paper for this  co-op mystery solving game. There may be little replay value but you definitely get enough bang for your buck with the amount of scenarios. Take your time with this one and enjoy the experience. Loved this much more than T.i.m.e Stories.

1982 English binder edition.

Spoilers possible below!

Case 1: We were close but we made stupid mistake. As we could not find factory in London directory we assumed there is no clue connected with this place. Therefore we missed a huge chunk of information.

Case 2: For me Sherlock's solution misses a good motive for the killer. We solved all side cases though. How could Sherlock possibly guess a story about gun not being to a gunsmith? Clearly competing with Holmes is a fun killer; it is far better to explore all clues to the very end, even if it means visits to a few dozen of places.

An amazing game. It's well written. It requires lots of (dubious) inference, some deduction, and teamwork.  

It's also frustrating -- sometimes the conclusions are not entirely satisfying from a puzzle-solving point of view.  But they've, so far, been entirely in line with Doyle's original stories.

In Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective, you are presented with a mystery to solve, and it is then up to you to trace the threads of evidence through the byways and mansions of nineteenth century London. You will interview suspects, search the newspapers for clues, and put together the facts to reach a solution.

Why were two lions murdered in Hyde Park? Who is responsible for the missing paintings from the National Gallery? Who murdered Oswald Mason and why? These are just a few of the cases that will challenge your ingenuity and deductive abilities.

This is not a board game: No dice, no luck, but a challenge to your mental ability. The game has been thoroughly researched for Holmesian and Victorian accuracy so as to capture a feeling of that bygone era.

Very interesting, highly thematic sleuthing game.  Playing this has some of the feel of participating in an RPG but the race aspect gives it some more focus and tension.  I love the setting and the period details.  A welcome antidote to a recent slew of relatively themeless, charmless but mechanically sound Euros.  Some clue points can sound bizarre if you arrived by an unexpected route but that is a small flaw in a very interesting and unique game.

Have so much fun with this game, one of my husband's favorites. Love the stories so far. Played the first and second cases so far. We don't really try to beat Sherlock we just try to answer as many questions as we can but will still continue to explore after to get the most out of each scenario. There are a couple connections that Sherlock makes that are a bit far fetched.

Mr. Holmes is my childhood idol till now.  There is a new Spanish edition - but only just the Spanish.  I can't read Spanish.  There is an upcoming French edition - but I can't read French too.  So I really hope that there will be another edition of this well-acclaimed game in English soon!  (and the dream come true. Yastari releases a 2012 edition in December!) A big plus is that the game is perfectly solo-friendly!

I presume, by acquiring knowledge hidden to the players before the game even starts, this "Sherlock Holmes, consulting detective" guy gets a bit of an edge that is hard to beat. Plays well as solo, and in groups. More of a storytelling thing than a game. Good way to spend cold nights (inside, warm and cosy, drinking tea, of course).

Sans aucun doute LE meilleur jeu d'enquête... Si vous voulez mener l'enquête, laissez tomber le Cluedo et les Mystères de Pékin... prenez un petit calepin et un stylo... Et lancez-vous dans Détective Conseil (titre du jeu en français)... Par contre, pour expliquer rapidement la note que j'ai mise: en terme de jeu d'enquête, ce jeu mérite un bon 9 (et frôle le 10 !)... Mais en terme de jeu, d'un point de vue général... parce que ce n'est pas un jeu toujours très accessible (le plus jeunes risquent de s'y perdre), parce qu'il n'est pas toujours évident de trouver des joueurs (même si on peut jouer tout seul... c'est quand même plus sympa à plusieurs !)...... je n'attribue "qu'un" 7... mais ne vous y trompez pas...: au risque de me répéter, c'est vraiment, de mon point de vue, le meilleur jeu d'enquête.

Everybody needs to experience solving at least one case of Sherlock.  It's great fun chasing down leads, noticing details, and connecting the dots.  I'd rate it higher, but I can't play it at night.

I really thought I'd be in to this game, but it's got enough reading that it's either really awkward having someone read aloud and then everyone else try to pay the requisite attention, or you'll have to photocopy everything and then wait 20-30 minutes for everyone to read the case before you can start discussion.

It's a neat idea, but it just fell really flat for me.  If I can find people interested in playing this, I'd rather play Hanabi with them instead.

While we are exceedingly bad at this game, this is certainly a classic and does all the things an actual deduction game should do. In fact, this is likely the first actual deduction game I've ever played; all others were really inductive reasoning.

I was looking so much to playing this game. However after hours and hours of reading I was at utter despair. This is more like revising for an exam then playing a game of enjoyment.
When you finally get to the point of making your logical deductions, you are asked questions on the case that no normal person would ever had expected. Fails in every department to motivate and reward. I was frustrated to the point of anger.
Both me and my friends cannot remember playing a game we disliked so much.
I am so disappointed and cannot understand the rave reviews I have read for this game in the past. 
I have been so traumatised by the experience I cannot face attempting another case and wasting another day of my life.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A unique game where you begin with a scenario and then choose a location where you interact with a suspect or a location.  The information enables you to move to another location to get more information.  If you are able to solve the cases with the least amount of information, your score goes up.  

The early scenarios have problems where you can solve the major case, but the leaps in logic that Holmes makes defy believability.  The third or fourth case may be broken but after that I have read the cases improve.  If you have a chance to play I recommend the game for its uniqueness.

Super neat puzzle game, bought off of Amazon when found it for not-incredibly-expensive to play with Abigail. We've....had fun with it? Sorta? We probably have played a single case a year, needing a lot of time to ourselves to settle down with it. That amount of time is rare nowadays, and if we were still playing other games it'd be worth it to have the change, but as it's looking we don't often play games anymore in the first place, is it worth pulling this out when we could play a couple others we miss playing?

I actually love this game, as it simulates poring over clues on the map, the newspaper, and the flavor text to find leads. It's just difficult to find the time to play it precisely because it is so involved and best played solo or as a couple.

This is a really unique game.  I really love playing it.  It has more of the feel of solving a puzzle or mystery rather than a traditional competition. The game is great as either solitaire or even as a group effort.  The game rewards and requires players to use true deductive and inductive reasoning and general logic.  A remarkable accomplishment for a game.  There are no dice, card draws or other luck factors.  This adds to the feeling of accomplishment.  There are 10 scenarios in the game.  It takes time to complete them so the game does have value for the price, but may have limited replay-ability.  Maybe new scenarios will be available in the future.  Still a great and unique game.

This just didn't click for me. I rather enjoy following the clues and reading the interviews, but the leaps in logic required to come to the correct conclusion are nuts. The map, newspapers and prose are all very thematic and do a great job of placing you in Holmes' London. The journey was fun enough and I may be tempted to play some of the unplayed cases with another gumshoe, but I don't think this genre is in my wheelhouse.

It is a fun and good game. However, the final questions are not always precise enough to be answered properly. Some of the main clues (that you read at the end) are not as conclusive as intended to be. Many times your final answers are based on guessing and not in evidence. Sometime key characters are not in home,so you have to look for them somewhere else. Each extra visit (when compared to Holmes) is 5 points less for you. This is one of the games that you should not keep track of the scoring. Anyway I like it.

Edit: My opinion of the game went worse with every mission. Initial score 7.5 - Final score 6 after five missions. Sold.

I love everything Sherlock Holmes. Basil Rathbone was always the one for me in the films and bookwise I always resort to the 3 volume New Annotated Sherlock Holmes put together by Leslie S Klinger. So when I got this last Christmas I dove straight into it.

I loved it. Then liked it. Then after completing all ten cases was umming and ahhing about my feelings for it. Sherlock your a cunning example of the human mind. Your leaps of deduction are far beyond my means of human thought or logic. I found this dispiriting and in a few cases could just not see how he could make the leaps of deduction he made to solve cases with the information he would have had at hand if he had followed the leads stated in the solutions. Dare I say it ... Holmes came across by the end of the game as a slightly sneaky cheat ... and one that rubbed my face in it!

I enjoyed the game and it gave me some great gaming moments. I remember losing myself down the consulting detective rabbit hole accompanied by a bottle of very nice red on a 7 hour train journey. Who did what during that investigation I cannot remember.

And I never will as I sold it after I completed all 10 cases. As much as I have hesitancy in my praise for the game in this mini review, If I could I would crack it all open again fresh faced hoping in some way to match Sherlock Holmes powers of deduction .... just to let him laugh at me all over again. It is that good .. and then that frustrating.

(4/16) 6. Really enjoyed my first play though I had the sense that some of the answers to the first case were almost abstractions of what we'd learned in the game?  Though perhaps that's the point.  Anyway, I'm looking forward to playing this again and feel like it's the type of game that improves as you continue to play it.

I just finished my first solo play of scenario 1. I got the case totally wrong (I don't even dare mention my score). However, after 4 hours of lingering on the case, including 5 glasses of scotch (GlenDronach mostatel finish  15 years, Macallan 12 years, BenRiach 15 years, and Bowmore 15 years darkest), it has been a total blast! I have not been immersed in a story like that with any other board game.

If you have enjoyed Sherlock Holmes, Consulting Detective, be sure to investigate the wonderful world of Interactive Fiction. This is the most similar experience to Sherlock Holmes you're likely to get.

It's now 2h32 AM: a drunk version of myself is now tuning out and turning in.

EDIT: Three games later with my girlfriend, this has become a favourite. We are scared of when we will be running out of scenarios!

This is a game wholly unlike anything else I've played to date, and I love it. Yes, it can only be played 10 times unless you wait a looooong time between replays, but based on my first play those 10 times are going to be a lot of fun. I like deduction games in general, and this one puts a pure and thematic spin on that genre.

Our first game was as a group of six playing as one team, and while we did horribly score-wise (a whopping 10 points...) we had a blast getting there. I'm not sure I'd enjoy it playing as individuals, but as a team game it's a hoot. Holmes makes for a very challenging opponent, and what he learns and how he learns it is instructive in terms of how the game thinks (and thinks you should think).

The components are fantastic, and do a great job of conveying the atmosphere of Holmes' London. The only area where they fall down is typos: We ran into quite a few in just one game, presumably an artifact of the translation process coupled with sloppy proofreading. (And the game does have a shitload of text.)

Not at all like a typical game, more like a freeform puzzle. Mr Holmes presents you ('you' being the Baker Street irregulars) with some basic information regarding a case. As a group you decide which locations to visit. If you get it right you can piece together more of the story and eventually (using your deductive powers, and info picked up from the newspapers) you should be able to answer a series of questions. A pleasant way to spend an evening.

RATING: 7
Definitely a niche game, unlike any other i've played. It's not eye catching or exciting to look at per-say. The fun comes from the story and its theme. Despite being a text based game that relies almost totally on mentally generated excitement rather than visual elements, it's quite immersive in gameplay. It's a total sandbox game where you can go from clue to clue or from person to person as you please, solving the crime on your own time. It's exciting to figure it out on your own, without being led by the hand. You could possibly not even solve the case correctly; and you sure won't ever beat sherlock's score. i don't know if you can even call this a game, it's more like a mental exercise using some text and your imagination. Hardly what i'm used to playing. But that being said, it was a very unique and enjoyable experience.

This was supposed to be a great game! It involves deduction, which I find interesting. The pieces look really nice. Its open ended, allowing you to travel around London and question who you want about the cases. You even get to interact with Sherlock Holmes himself! Fascinating stuff!

Then I played it. The more people you talk to about the case the more questions and doubt arise in your mind. Everywhere you go leads you down seemingly endless paths of vague possibility. People you think may be key characters to question have little to say, people who you’d never think have anything of use to offer wind up being incredibly important. I’d spend two hours pouring over the fine details of a case only to have no better idea of “who done it” than when I first opened the case file.

It’s impossible to get any kind of decent score, forget win a case (which involves getting a better score than Sherlock himself). This makes the game frustrating at first, then boring, then pointless.

It's questionable whether this is actually a game or rather a social activity, regardless it's a lot of fun to play especially in smaller numbers. It feels like a classic choose-your-own adventure book taken to a much higher level, there is so much detail and content here that it will keep you busy for a while, which is good because once you know the solution some of the value is gone. Oh and it's guaranteed to make you feel a bit stupid.

Fun game, though I've only played it solo.  It's like a more interactive version of an old Encyclopedia Brown/Ten-Minute Mystery case.  As noted, you really get your dressing down at the end because the cases are extremely well written and as such Holmes can quite logically figure out everything in three locations while you visit half of London trying to get a clue (har har).  Great game and very steeped in Victoriana, for you history buffs.

First play and we were on the completely wrong track. Because I read the scoring example that said something like "if Sherlock followed 5 leads..." I thought that our 7 leads were too many and I pushed the group to make a guess. Ugh. I'm excited to play this again, but am also a little nervous to do so because of my poor performance last time.

Finally, after owning it for years I got to try out a case with my girlfriend.  

After exhausting every lead possible we arranged our accusation and got it right.  I am sure Sherlock would have had the answer in 5 turns or less...

An amazingly immersive game which can be played competitively or co-operatively.

I love deduction games although I usually make critical errors when it comes to Code 7 or Black Vienna.

It was nice to see us get the murder right for a change!  Many people say Pandemic was the first co-operative game with merit.  I dis-agree with that assessment now.  It was SH: Consulting Detective.

I find it really interesting that this game won the SdJ.  I think this would be difficult to play with pre-teen children.  This game just seems so different than any other picks (either before or after).  

With the expansions I could see this easily become addicting for a long, long time.

The physical side of the game is just right.  Sifting through papers and maps feels right for the period.  Put it on a computer screen and it would fall flat.

Two cases in and so far I think the system is simple and neat. The game is more like an experience as you unfold the story through the eyes of the investigators. As the content of the case is critical to the experience, I think it is worth rating the cases individually.

CASE 1: 9/10 - A great case to get your feet wet. The story was interesting and funny, and at times, the book seemed to read your mind.

CASE 2: 6/10 - Didn't care too much for this one. We would have never solved it.

[u]30-May-2016[/u]:  To put it briefly, this "game" puts you right in the heart of a Sherlock Holmes mystery, allowing you to make the decisions of where the story goes, what clues are important, and finding the answer to the mystery at hand. I put the word game in quotes, because I think this is more of an interactive story than a typical hobby game we normally play. The rules offer you a way to tally points at the end and compare your results to Sherlock himself as a win condition. But if you play that way, I would guess your experience will be frustrating and disappointing. Rather, Consulting Detective is more an immersive experience than a game you are trying to win.

This might be the most thematic game in my collection. You really are the one trying to solve the mystery. The designer and publisher have done an impressive job, overall, putting this together. It's all text on paper. There are no fancy cardboard bits to move around. No minis. No cards, even. It's a box full of papers. And lots and lots of words. There are ten case books, ten "newspapers," a map of London, and a directory of names and places to visit. You'll need to provide some paper and a good pencil, because you need to take notes, probably the more the better. Each casebook opens with the setup of the mystery written just like a "real" Sherlock Holmes story. This person was killed here, with this type of weapon. He worked over there. Is/was married to this person. And this other person maybe witnessed part of the crime. Now, go!

The difficulty, of course, is putting all of the pieces together. There is most certainly a high level of deduction involved when trying to come to a conclusion about the crime and its perpetrators. Some places you visit and people you speak to will give you several pieces of information. Other times, it will be an extremely brief encounter without any help offered to your case. You'll need to track this information, decide which pieces fit into the puzzle you are putting together, and then make a resolution based on your deduction skills.

There are some component issues as well. The font in the case books is awful, in my opinion. It's all italicized and "fancy." The line width is too thin to stand out on the parchment paper stylized background. Some of the letters were unintelligible to me, and I had difficulty reading the story, let alone take notes and make deductions based on what I had read. I got used to it, over the three cases, but it could be much, much better.  And the typos, oh my! They are all over the place. At first, I didn't notice many. But once I did, I couldn't help but see them again and again. As elaborately intertwined the as the story is, you would think the editing would have been equally impressive. Perhaps it was mainly due to translation from one language to another, but it detracts from what is a creative puzzle of disjointed paragraphs.

But to wrap up...Wow! What a highly thematic, immersive experience Consulting Detective provides. Not only are you involved with the story as it progresses, you are in it, making the decisions as to what is important to note and what direction to head next. It's quite impressive how this thing is all put together, with the basic setup of a story, the long and winding puzzle of the narrative, and the intertwining of the newpapers and map of London with the case being solved. Yes, there are both moments of frustration and success when it comes to your own mastery of deduction. But the good thing is, you can go back and look for those juicy tidbits of information that you missed the first time, and see just how it all comes together in the end.

RATING: 5
A dinner party game where players will really need to perform some in depth detective work.  There's a ton of reading involved and in today's day and age I think many players could get bored after awhile.  I love the map, the newspapers and the depth but was put off by some of the wordiness of the script and the overall length of the experience.  If I could go back in time to the seventies and play this in front of a warm fire in the carpeted family room I would love it.

Very fun game that engages the brain in a great way, makes you pay attention to the little things and deduct the solution. Only drawback is that it only has 10 cases and it's tough to be able to play more than once.

Played the first four (german) cases so far. The first One (shot armour manufacturer(?)) was quite good and logical, but the following three (inszenierter Mord, Tote Löwen im Hyde Park und Code bei der Leiche) were so far fetched at some Point that even with knowledge of all hints and evidences you still can not deduce the solution. It‘s really rediculous how the pieces shall stick together in my opinion.
Giving it one or two more chances before putting it in the lötest shelf of the cupboard.

RATING: 9.5
Fantastic game. It's almost more a sort of roleplaying game than an actual board game, but great nonetheless. 

If you`re a fan of either Sherlock Holmes or detective stories, this one is a must; and even if you are not, unless you're positive you don't like those, you should at least try it. The only downside if that it has 0 replayability, for once you're done with the 10 cases... that's it.
Because of that same thing, you don't want to be hasty: take your time, think every clue throughly, both to do well and to get the most out of the experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great idea - Inventive, exciting and rather rewarding.

The big issue is that not enough care is taken with the clues - Sherlock jumps to conclusions that the evidence isn't strong enough to support... In my humble onion.

One of the best games that I own, though it comes with a disclaimer: Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective is not a board game.  Rather it is more akin to role-playing a finely-written mystery novel.


Judging this against a game such as 'Salmon Run' or 'Invasion From Outer Space' is entirely unfair.

... Of course that will not stop me from doing so.

Probably the most evocative game I've played. The beautifully written narratives clouded my demanding gamers mind and tapped straight in my  love for Sherlock. Eventually the clouds parted and I saw it for what it is. The first case and it's conclusion left me cold. I sifted through mounds of information, making notes and discussing threads with my fellow sleuth to find some logical answers to the case at hand. It was all in vain as the answer had barely anything to do with the goose hunt we had been sent on. I wanted to find irrefutable proof but the game offers highly subjective logic and after two hard weeks snooping I felt somewhat cheated. A great atmosphere but very little in the way of game.

What fun! We were misled in our first case, but this souped up combination of Choose Your Own Adventure and Encyclopedia Brown was still an entertaining experience. We like all the parts of the game--the map, newspaper clippings, directory--and the gameplay is really quite different from anything else we've tried. We'll definitely be playing this one again soon.

UPDATE: Not. Yes, a couple plays were entertaining and different, but the sense that the cases are nigh impossible to solve has kept us from playing again.

This game is fantastic, but what really pushes it over the edge is the wonderful social interaction you have amongst a group of friends trying to cleverly deduce the solution to a crime.

Read the case intro and start investigating!  A directory, map, and newspapers provide the clues. Follow a lead, then go to the appropriate paragraph in the casebook. Take notes.  When you think you solved the case, go to the end of the casebook, read the closing story, and answer the questions for scoring.  Compare your score against Sherlock Holmes' score of 100. Win or lose, it's good fun.

Having played Mythos Tales before this one, I was left a little underwhelmed in comparison. Not to say that this isn't a quality product, but it will really humble your deduction skills. I prefer Mythos Tales for both the theme and ease of entry, as Consulting Detective throws you into the deep end from the get-go. Not that this is bad. I still enjoy the experience of the journey. I would just say Mythos Tales is probably a better game to start with at this point.

I'm normally not a fan of cooperative games but my non-gaming wife is at least a fan of Sherlock Holmes so I bought this game, hoping that we'd both like this narrative activity

But is Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective a game or an activity? There are no playing pieces, no board you move around on, and no cards to draw and play. There is a booklet for each of the ten adventures, telling you what happens at certain London locations, but is this really different from the old (and pretty boring) choose your own adventure books?

As a matter of fact, yes. Instead of a few limited choices, you have a London map at your disposal and are free to go anywhere for clues. Additional clues, as well as a sense of authenticity, is provided by newspapers, one per case. The clues themselves are cleverly written, telling several intervowen intrigues, that may or may not be related to the main case. The actual "game" is about revealing the murderer and motif, using as few clues as possible, but the game experience come from participating in a detective story that feels like it was written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle himself.

Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective may not be a game for everybody and even then it will only last for ten sessions. However, it does offer a pleasant experience and is one of few games that my wife appreciates.

The best solo/couple and deduction game in existence.  Shut Up and Sit Down called it the best game for couples and listed it the #5 board game of all time.  Since their video review, the game (1981 release originally, mind you) has shot up from barely in the top 200 to now in the top 70, and that is despite it being out of print for half a year or so.

I have only played the first 2 missions, and I have heard there is a big flaw with the 3rd one, but honestly, I have gotten more than $27 or the $40 it might be going for out of it.  It's that good.  It's so clever, makes you feel stupid, yet makes you want to keep trying to beat Sherlock.

At the same time, I know there are only 10 missions (still wondering if the expansions that came out in the 80s will see a re-release now), so I am hesitant to continue playing with my gf because it's like a great book: once you start a mission you can't stop but you are very sad when it's over.  Brilliant.  It's as intelligent as the BBC Sherlock (disclaimer: I have only seen the first 3) and really a game every single gamer should try.

Just buy it.

[b]Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective[/b]

Case #1
Enjoyed our first case (2 players)! Your gray cells are put to the challenge, though at least for the first case, I can say it was solved without too much of a problem. 

The greatest problem (and enjoyment!) is in that you are faced with so many possible avenues to explore. You must pick and choose, prioritize to be most efficient and solve the mystery in the least amount of steps, trying to outdo Sherlock Holmes.

The map, the public directory, and daily newspaper are excellent tools, and all three must be used. There is a fair amount of reading, thinking, re-reading, discussing, and sometimes arguing with your team mate(s), ie. the impatient and gut-instincted are pitted against the more patient and analytical.

Currently wondering how this is played in teams? 2v2v2v2? Are all the indices shared publicly?

Shutup and Sitdown review:
[video=51150][/video]


Case #2 (May 1, 2016)
5 players (my gf invited her girl friends, the original idea was to play my new AEG edition of Junta with 6, but one friend had to leave after dinner, so we went with Sherlock). Decided it was best not to split into teams, maybe some other time. The three were new to the game, so they first played Case #1, and enjoyed the game so much we continued with #2. This mystery was more difficult: we thought we had it solved, but were very surprised to learn we had gotten only 50% correct. Hmmm! The game worked very well. No alpha leader problems. Everyone had a very fun time.

I heard this is a one-and-done kind of game, and I'm not sure how I feel about sinking money into a temporary solo "story game". If it was like Danganronpa or Phoenix Wright, perhaps, but we'll see. Having read some Sherlock Holmes texts recently, I never thought Arthur Conan Doyle did a great job with the character either, so I'm not sure how much I like the detective anymore, though the movies were great.

Play after the expansion ish: Okay ish. IMO this game series feels more like a book than a board game, which is fine but its very much a different experience. Not bad but not a game much in my eyes. There's so much reading and tracking clues and such, which is cool I suppose, but its not much of a boardgame and its one of the few things I think doesnt fully belong on BGG.

I think I'd rather play a logical deduction game like Black Vienna or Salem, which are more replayable and more raw logic. Some clues in this seem chance-y whether you could optimize to beat Holmes too. Plus I don't care as much for Conan Doyle's work/world since I prefer Agatha Christie's writings.

Paragraph system benefits from being well written. Holmes's solutions are ludicrously fast. Plays nicely as a cooperative game, in fact it's mechanically easier than passing the book around and trying to out-do the other players. Several expansions, including one set within a large house, and one set in Paris. More replayable than some have suggested, as long as you leave several months (or years) before retrying a case.

Gumshoe was the hardboiled Chandleresque version, also recommended.

This game is a class of it's own!
Never played anything like this one before.
I love how you get the information in the case file like a detective and what you actually do is detect the culprit of a case.
It has 10 cases,one harder than the other.
A really good mind game, with deduction.
Get a notebook a pencil and start cracking those cases.

This provided good solo entertainment, and I wouldn’t mind playing another case if it was placed before me. 
I wouldn’t rush out to buy more scenario’s though. Good but not great.
I don’t see any replayability without buying additional stories. Sure, I could keep this for years, and maybe at some point I will have forgotten them, but I didn’t enjoy them enough such that it’s worth it to me to hang on to them for a long while plus the most interesting bits tend to stay in memory for a very long time. I’ll try to trade it for something I can play right away instead.

Owned the original Sleuth boxed edition as a kid, and while the nostalgia factor does come into play, this is still a wonderful, thematic game that's unlike anything else in my collection.

Seems pointless to try to beat Holmes - and I've never used the scoring system.  The joy of the game comes from immersing oneself in the experience and taking one's time in working through the cases.  Not something to be rushed...in fact, with only ten cases, and no real replayability beyond waiting 20 years for the details of the cases to be forgotten, it's an experience to be savored.

Some translation issues from the French and font/hand-written notes can be difficult to read.

It's like a package of 10 murder mystery dinner kits where all the parts have textual stand ins. So no dress-up required.

But: 1) is this your sort of thing? 2) is it a board game or a murder mystery dinner? (the rating I've given is for SHCD as a board game, but as a murder mystery dinner I'd rate it a 10)

The game is almost unlosable, adjudged from the point of view of correctly solving the provided questions. All you have to do is follow enough leads. (Contrast this to Witness, which features 64 delightful mysteries in one, but is very much losable due to having an actual game mechanic) There is a rubric that subtracts points for not being efficient, which helpfully encourages the obsessives and perfectionists to pore and re-pore over provided data, engage in long, drawn-out discussions over which lead to visit next, and in general does what it can to revere the god of irony.

I want to love this, and at times, I do. The first case we did pretty badly but felt it was our own stupidity and having learned our lesson, strove to do better! Case 2, we had a good score. 65 I believe. Got all the main questions right, went to far more leads than Holmes of course and didn't do great on bonus questions. We worked out some pretty tricky stuff perfectly. Case 3 left a bit of a bad taste with its logic which we wrote off. Case 4 was a disgrace in design though. We could not work it out. We went to every location and found everything we needed and still could not put the pieces together. Holmes went to very few leads and those leads alone can not possibly tell you ANYTHING, let alone all the answers. It was ridiculous! This game has exhilarating highs but also has pitiful, laughable lows.

A game about detectives can't get truer to life than this -the only hint of structure being that each player gets one clue at a time from the book. Apart from that, the full wealth of materials available (directory, newspaper extracts, map, case book) can be used at any time to solve the pending case. There's the obvious tension of working against the clock -two hours pass by very quickly. 

Of course the players will never get the solution as quickly as Sherlock Holmes, but if you skip the complete answers the first time a couple of replays per case can still be available for the player's entertainment. Unfortunately this can't be repeated over and over again -the only real problem in an otherwise impeccable game.

RATING: 7
Gioco molto interessante per la sua originalità. Si tratta quasi di un gioco di ruolo dove i giocatori, collaborando, dovranno risolvere un caso cercando di far meglio dello stesso Holems, o per lo meno avvicinarsi a lui, cercando di risolvere il caso senza perdere troppo tempo in piste false. La bellezza del gioco sta nella libertà assoluta di azioni dei giocatori che a loro discrezione potranno seguire le piste che riterranno opportuno, far visita a sospettati o esperti in varie materie e trarre informazioni utili anche dai quotidiani. Per risolvere il caso spesso serve intuito, attenzione, fortuna e una buona analisi. La riuscita delle partite per il divertimento di tutti riesce tanto più il gruppo si conosce ed è compatto. Il gioco ha il difetto di non essere rigiocabile, ovvero una volta fatte le 10 avventure il tutto è finito, salvo trovare nuove avventure che immagini spesso sarà possibile scaricare. Personalmente penso che il gioco poteva essere integrato con un cd con le tracce di tutte le letture.

A deduction game quite unlike any other - almost an RPG or an extended piece of interactive literature. It's deeply thematic, quirky, beautifully written, rich with possibilities and historical touches, and I absolutely love it. But then, I'm the sort of odd person whose favourite bit of any spy thriller is the endless poking about in dusty libraries looking for clues.

It's virtually a given that you need the right crowd for this - invariably a group of Holmes buffs who will dress up and act their way throughout the thing. And it's peculiarly interesting how collaboration arises from the mechanics and storytelling themselves, even if you start off with purely selfish intentions.

I love this. Being a fan of the old Sherlock Holmes and Agatha Cristie Stories this is exactly my "cup of tea". This has a lot of what I wanted from Time Stories but only got to a small extent from that game so far. I would love it though if parts of the Time Stories mechanic could be implemented in future cases (as there seem to be new cases coming now) and that is specifically the idea of tokens that mark what knowledge you already have and that might unlock new options at certain locations. 

So far played: 
Case 1: astonishing 90 or 65 points (1 of the main questions we completly guessed, but did so surprisingly correct, so we are not sure how much we deserve those extra 25 points)

Case 2: we were sure we solved the main case at some point but then wanted to follow up some more stuff so we calculated scores for both (that turned out to be not too different): we solved the main case with 85 points and after several more leads with some extra things figured out we had 80 points)

Case 3: a bit of an odd (and weaker) one for us. Officially we scored 40, but we basically had all the information we "used" at the end, already 7 completly useless leads earlier as we were almost desperatly trying to find a more concrete hint for something we asumed but couldn't really confirm. Turned out (looking back through the case book after the solution) that that proof in some form never really existed, so it just felt like a bit of a leap for us.

Case 4: 70 points and in contrast to the last we felt pretty confident on this one, we did spend quiet some time with the "sidequest" though (and it even felt like we solved another murder that noone ever asked us about :( )

Case 5: First time we officially beat Holmes with 110 points. Liked this case a lot, the crypted message and also one of the other notes were an interesting puzzle and overall the pieces came together nicely in this one.

Had to lower my initial vote, because some cases seem to require sheer luck, more than pure deductive logic. There can be one and only one place where you absolutely must go to be able to understand who is the real culprit, and if you don't go there... or go there too late... you won't have a chance at winning.
You might get everything else right, but be wrong about the culprit, and never even hear his/her name once in all your travelling around in London.

Still, the game is more about an enjoyable experience with your friends, than it is about actually beating Sherlock Holmes. I find it funny and enjoyable nonetheless, with the only real drawback of being an one-time-only experience.

A ton of reading in this game. But boy do I love it. Even if it is like Murder She Wrote in that how the "master" comes to their solution makes you angry, and confused you still have fun. It's like a choose your own adventure in a way. Obviously flaw of this game is that you only get 10 cases. Though considering their fullness and complexity this is totally reasonable from a manufacturing and design standpoint. I am sure there is probably fan-created content out there too. 

On a side note I and my friend John and maybe Ashley were the only ones that seemed engaged in the game. John wanted to get through all the fluffy exposition to the meat of the details and my voice started going as I was reading the content. So I may just enjoy this most as a solo endeavor.

This is one of my favorite games.  I love the fact that you can play alone, with one other person, or with a group.  The components are of good quality and include a map of London, newspaper archives (printed in book form, but still nice), a directory of London residents and businesses, and introductory materials that set the scene (in case you're not a Holmes' fan) and establish how you are to proceed in order to solve each case.  The cases themselves are plausible and the clues are reasonable.  It's possible to draw this game out for hours if your group is given to debate, or to wrap things up relatively quickly if all players are in agreement as to how best to proceed, and on the interpretation of the clues collected.  

As much as I love this game, it has its faults. For instance, part of the scoring for each case is based on a quiz requiring knowledge of Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories.  This puts those not in the know at a disadvantage. Furthermore, being penalized for having needed to visit more locations than Holmes supposedly did in search of clues is annoying. My group found that in almost every case, if we had only visited the places Holmes did, we would not have had sufficient information to solve the case. And then there are the typos--no excuse for that.    (5+5) solo plays: 2

I have a more recent printing of this game, can't be as old as 1981. My main complaint is the translation to English being absolutely abysmal, and considering the bulk of the game is reading, you're gonna be laughing at a lot of spelling mistakes.

Otherwise, my other complaint should be an obvious one, lack of re-playability. Once you've solved a case, the likelihood of replaying it is minimal unless you play it with an all new group. Even then you'll still remember it.

This isn't a normal game.  The basic set has 10 cases and once you've done them that's it, you cant do them again, but it is one of the best games ever. I have run this game at various clubs with teams of people competing against each other to get the most points in the quiz at the end of the case.  The cases are well thought out, and the atmosphere of Holmes' Victorian London is captured very well.

RATING: 8.5
If you're tired of victory tracks and farming, this is a fantastic experience for any number of people. While we can quibble about the exact classification of Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective as a game, that won't distract from how immersive, atmospheric and beautiful the game really is. I would suggest treating the game as a standard RPG campaign with your friends. Thematically, the flow of game is simple: find clues, chase down suspects, and put it altogether for the next step in the case. But be forewarned: Do NOT try and beat Sherlock. His strategy is the fewest leads, giving you only half the story. If you want the full immersive experience, go for the red herrings and obvious false leads of the case. The most successful strategies I've seen have been to focus on characters and locations that will give you the MOST information.  The game will throw red herrings and a slew of unnecessary information, slyly tempting you to chase down every lead and fit every clue within the giant puzzle of the case but that will take you further from Sherlock's path! The game doesn't want you to exhaust every resource, but to be efficient and use the knowledge you already have to the best of your ability. The cooperative experience was amazing and filled with invigorating debate and discussion (like Mysterium). Powers of reasoning and observation, everything that Sherlock Holmes is the standing epitome of, it's all here in this fantastic game. And there's expansion cases coming later in the year!

This is more for solitaire or group co-operative play if you're into that kind of thing. Pick the most likely spot for the most revealing clues, read the text associated with the spot, then pick the next most likely spot, and so on. So it's more like reading a novel than it is playing a game. If you want to score as well as "Sherlock" does in the answer section, simply hope that you prioritised the same spots as he and picked up all the same nuances. For competitive play, you run into the problem of having to pass the clue book around, and some of the text is lengthy, therefore a lot of downtime between turns.

"Excellent mystery-solving co-op. Rich and thematic, but not in an overwhelming way. However, the first case was more fun than the next three. Hopefully they'll get better again."

What I like (based on 1 case so far):
- Thematic and logical cases with lots of flavor
- Each case can be completed in 60-90 minutes
- Avoids the bloat and confusion of Gumshoe (a later game by the same folks)

What I don't like:
- The number of clues needed by Holmes are silly (low)
- "Only" 10 cases in the box (obviously more would be nice)
- The first case was great. The second was OK. The third and fourth were disappointing. Hopefully they'll get better again. 

This is an excellent mystery-solving game. It's very pure, where you read the introduction to the case, and then choose where to go or who to talk to in order to gain clues. The clues make thematic sense (unlike some games which rely on logic puzzles).

I would put the weight around 2.0, much lower than BGG voters. I guess I don't count the immersive depth as "weight".

I was sceptical about this one, because I read some bad reviews from people I respect.

I bought it because my wife likes mystery literature and because she is pregnant and it's difficult for her to lean over the table, to play typical board games.

Worked like a charm. Like a good book. Like a great movie. Plus we have all the time we wan't to chat with each other about the outcome. Really felt we were solving the cases ourselves.

Last week we went to a concert, and took a case with us to solve while we were waiting for the show to start. You can practicaly play it anywhere and without the need for every one to be round the table. I strongly believe this game shines as a co-op. You shouldn't play seperatly. 

Just go with the flow. I make notes on the clues I get. I make family trees. I colour the places I visited on a copy of the map. Real detectives!

Great, Great, Great!!!

I agree that there is no replayability. In that sense I don't consider it a board game, but a beautiful experience that worths every penny spent!

Just don't rush. Take your time to study the clues you got and put them together after every clue. It's more rewarding to solve a case witn less clues, than reading your way through the case.

(Wife's Point of View: She plays witn me EVERY time I ask her. With usual board games she plays with me 2 times, if I ask her ten times. Do the maths and purchase)

A fun game and definitely something different. Nicely produced overall BUT there are typos that spoil the effect and we ran into a glitch, whereby characters started telling us about events we should not have known about yet. Also, we missed a clue that proved vital, but we reckon even Sherlock himself would not have thought to search where the answer was! So we didn't feel silly, just vaguely cheated. Hope the second scenario works better :) 

Yep the Tin Soldier was a lot better but still a few typos.

The new version as pictured, not the 1981 original.

Have been meaning to get this to the table for months, but wanted to be able to do it justice as I've been relishing it.

OK, I played the first of the ten cases... The Munitions Magnate.

I don't want to spoil the case for anyone because there is unlikely to be any replayability in the cases, but you know that when you buy it.

Woohoo... I correctly deduced the perpetrator and the motive, but didn't get all the nuances of the case, so I scored 85 out of the possible 140 points.

Sadly I then had to deduct 5 points for every non-'free' lead I followed in excess of Sherlock.

It was my first case and I was trying to be meticulous and followed 15 scorable leads compared to Sherlock's miserly 4 !

That meant I had to deduct 55 points, leaving a final total of only 30.

But still a moral victory :D

:thumbsup:  Uber thematic

:thumbsup: Beautifully produced. High quality documents and love the Newspaper sheets for each case.

In Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective, players attempt to solve a mystery by visiting various witnesses and other people connected to the case and listening for clues in the stories they tell.  Each turn, a player decides who to visit, including a number of always-available people like the coroner or Lestrade at Scotland Yard, or they can visit someone who's specifically connected to this case (including people learned about over the course of the investigation).  Players are encourages to compete with Holmes by trying to solve the case visiting as few witnesses as Holmes does, but that's more of an aspirational goal.  When the players are ready to make an accusation, they must answer a series of questions related to the case and can then compare their answers to Holmes.  This game involves a lot of frantic unstructured note-taking, as you never know which details might be important later, and you can't really review the text of old visits.  I didn't hate it, but I thought it was more work than it was worth.

I'm unsure of how to rate this. I've only played the first scenario and now I have a much better understanding of the game flow and process. It's almost like a choose your own adventure in a box. I strongly doubt this game is replayable unless you let it sit around for a few years and gradually forget the clues.

I do think it would be a great game to pass around to other people since nothing is written on and it would make a great one time gift kind of a thing.

One last thing, but I'm not really into deduction style games. Sleuth and this one have really only been the ones to keep my attention.

Great game for those who like mysteries and are looking for a total immersion experience in late-Victorian London.  Very well done mysteries.  No board, but you use several reference materials (replica 1890 London address book, city map, London Times newspaper, etc.).  Good solo game, or with a partner trying to solve the mystery in as few clues as possible.  Great atmosphere if you have imagination.

Cooperative sleuthing. Players are presented with a case, and attempt to solve it by gathering clues from the days newspaper, reading descriptions of the crime scene or interviews with suspects/bystanders, consulting the London Directory, and a large dash of Holmsian deduction. The cases are well-written and seem quite difficult. I think the game achieves its purpose perfectly, so if it sounds fun, you'll probably like it. The only major flaw is that I can't imagine there's much replay value. Expansions to the rescue!

Was much higher for me but seems to be completely outmoded by more recent story based offering such as T.I.M.E. stories and pandemic legacy, I imagine this will start slipping for others as well as this design space if explored further and further.

The real problems boils down to the fiddliness of the components and the complete reliance on text, almost no visual elements prevent immersion on the level of time stories and its ilk

As a kid I read all of the Encyclopedia Brown books and this game felt like I was immersed in one of them. Lots of fun!

I had a lot of fun poring through the directory, newspapers and clues to solve the case. So far, I've found the cases pretty easy to solve... not sure if they will get harder as I get further into the game or if I have been lucky.

Too bad the game isn't replayable after you solve the 10 mysteries. That said, I liked it enough that I'll seek out the expansions at some point.

I've only played 1 mission and I'm roughly 25% through the second with my SO.  And so far it's an awesome game.  My ONLY issue with this game is that Sherlock figures out the mystery in the dumbest way.  Based off of the first mission he basically guessed who the killer was from the moves he did, he did not have any concrete evidence.  If Sherlock was a detective living in this day and age he would've gotten fired his rookie year.

This isn't a game, it's an experience. I bought this in the hope my son (in his 20's) would enjoy it when he stayed over for a few days. It was amazing!! We played 5 cases over the weekend and spent hours discussing it, figuring them out, chasing leads.  He loved it that much he made me promise not to play until I see him again . So now I've got a 2 month wait on my hands!!  
There are definitely some cases better than others but my advice is just enjoy the whole experience without even caring to try and beat Holmes. He solves cases in minimal leads so if you managed to beat him then you would have more than likely made a few good guesses, and if you're wrong then you'll just feel disappointed and you won't be able to go back because you now know the solution,  and yes you might get there quickly but you'll just miss out on the pleasure of really figuring it out and following it through completely.  The sense of satisfaction at the conclusion is something to savour. It's a great feeling when you get stuck, to brainstorm , and have a breakthrough. And trust me, that will happen. Remember to use newspapers from previous cases, not just the one from the same date.   
My games of choice are usually takes like Mangrovia, Helios, Catan, Marco Polo Splendor, Pandemic , Sushi Go, Love Letter,  but this  blew me away completely.  It's worth every penny and it will hopefully bring you the same joy. Once me and my son finally complete this then I think I might actually grieve!

One of them readin' games. Read the case background, then the newspaper, then the clues. And be sure to take notes. Not for everyone. I've only played solo. With more it might be more fun, but how to handle all that reading? 

The cases are tough. Are they fair? The scoring probably isn't. Holmes himself uses the fewest clues possible, but for us, there is usually no clear next best step (more like 2-3 equally good ideas). So I don't think you should take seriously slight differences in scores. In fact, maybe you shouldn't worry about your score at all. The game wouldn't be worth it if you solved every case in five clues.

A true challenge, this one. Love the map of Victorian England. There is a great deal of information to be gathered and the clues can be devilishly subtle. For atmosphere, there are few games that can truly compare if you've got the right complement of players. Works quite well as a solo game also. I have the notebook version and have kept if for 20+ years. Very nice game.

There are sometimes plot holes in the stories. During the scoring claims like "Sherlock solved this with 4 clues" are absolutely stupid, solving one of the tasks with a handfull of clues is not solving: It's an arbituary guess, nothing more.

I've been 'addicted' to this hobby/pastime for nearly 20 years, due to making the decision (after rolling for a character sheet in a RPG intro) to fill the rest of the evening playing board/card games in the next room. My heart was set to learn RPG as I like the imaginative stimulation, but I wasn't confident that I had the mental resources to pull off an entertaining narrative. So into the foreign world of Siedler and Entwicklung I went, admittedly confused, without the need to be embarrassed within a prepared fantasy world. But 6Nimmt was the highlight for the evening and one of the first games I introduced to the family I married into when I migrated to Australia. The fun we had made me look into more games using Sumo/Games Cabinet for information leading to the next 'hit'. 

Spiel des Jahres was becoming part of my vocab, hence my interest in Sherlock to replace the burnout with Cluedo. But I was too interested now in the mechanism heavy designs of the Eurogame and donated my Sleuth copy to my overseas mum, without putting pen to paper.

Fast forward 15 years or so, worn out by mechanisms, resource conversion etc, marvelling at how my boys develop, especially in the acquisition of language (I've tried to learn Deutsch), I've taken a stronger interest in narrative. In summary I'm no longer fascinated by what goes on under the hood of the eurogame engine, how to squeeze as much potential and forward movement on the score track by doing the maths of input vs output; I just want to simply get in, go for a drive, see what scenery I will encounter as this makes for far more interesting, emotional memories than relating tales of drag race meets. I was now ready for the first Ystari edition of Sherlock. I didn't anticipate it would become the best game I've played so far, knocking Siedler from its 10 rating.

RATING: 8
A simply amazing game. A collection of paragraphs, newspapers, maps, and clues that give you an interesting story to try and solve. 

Decide who you want to talk to and look him to find out what he knows. Figure it all out and compare your score to Sherlock's.

The only problem with this game is that the replayability can suffer once you know whodunnit. I've found that "GMing" the game for others can be a great way to experience the same story again. If more people buy this, we may see expansions as well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
It's not a game. But it's one of the most enchanting experiences I had with friends who play boardgames.

You know, my biggest problem with board gaming in general is that sometimes you meet old friends and decide to play a boardgame, but for the duration of the game, they stop being people and become simply "players", so after hours of gaming you still haven't talked to them about how they are doing and what they're up to, because, frankly, you are playing a game and only talking and acting within its boundaries.

This is different, because you control the pace, there is no "turn" or "phase" you have to follow. Suddenly, it's not a distraction, but part of the game to leave the table in order to make coffee or go for a walk together (or seperately). And inbetween (at least for us), we naturally started talking about ourselves and caught up on things without anybody going "guys, can we please focus on the game?? It's your turn, what do you do?". 

In short, it's unique, go and play it, it will enrich your life.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Been a long time since I've played this but I've always enjoyed it.  It might even be so long that I can play it all again and not remember the solutions. 

Although It's always good to see if you can match Holmes' rating, in reality it's virtually impossible as there are so many locations to visit and what seems the logical line of inquiry was circumvented by Holmes' super sense that enables him to solve the case in the barest minimum of clues. In any case, you'll often want to visit 'just one more location' to flesh out your case and perhaps give you a fighting chance to answer some of the peripheral questions at the denouement. 

A slight annoyance, as far as I can remember, is that in a murder case you would expect that a visit to the coroner or police surgeon would always yield results. But, presumably to add a bit of variety to the cases, this isn't always as rewarding as you would hope.

I have also played the Mansion House and Queen's Park modules. The QP module is in fact one huge case; a familiarity with storyline of 'The Maltese Falcon' may be a help here (or even a hindrance).

I was really skeptical about this game, but boy did we enjoy it. The idea is this, you are Sherlock's minions. You are presented with a mystery. You are given a scenario book that contains all the dialogue of everyone you can talk to about the case in the city. You also get a map of London and essentially a yellow pages for the map. The goal is to solve the mystery in as few interviews as possible. Players choose when to end the game, and when they do, Holmes as of course already solved the mystery and you are scored based on your ability to answer 6 questions about the mystery correctly. Then you lose points for each person you interviewed in excess of who Holmes's process through the case. We really had a ball, and I'm only lamenting that there aren't an infinite number of mysteries in the box. With only 9 more mysteries to go, I won't run out soon, but knowing there's an end brings me some lamentation.

I will say, the new printing of the game we have does have several glaring and frustrating translation errors. The player aid on the back of the book uses German(?) style direction abbreviations in place of NW, NE, SW, SE and we found a "die" in place of "the", and one or two other little errors that threw us off a little.

I've been wanting to try this for years and it didn't disappoint. It's not so much a board game, more a piece of interactive fiction. I read out the clues and kept track of all the names while Sarah did most of the actual detective work! We managed to solve the first case, albeit with a pitiful score. I don't think score is really the point of this one though; the better you score, the less of the game you get to experience.

It has the feel of those adventure books where you must visit page XX and then decide if you want to go to XY, XXY or XXZ. And then on and on.

Best if you have someone else to play with you, as you can talk with each other about what's going on.

I feel I'll have this game for quite a long time though, as I don't expect to play it more than twice a year.

EDIT: I lied to myself. I'm already facing the seventh case. The game is that good! I'm increasing its rating.

I wouldn't call SHCD a board game, but an activity, which makes it really hard to rate. Ultimately, when I want to play a board game, this type of experience is not what I'm after. Even as an activity, I found it frustrating that we wanted to go places (which turned out to be vitally important) that we couldn't find on the miniscule map. While reading the solution, none of us could figure out how Sherlock cracked the case with the provided information—he seemed to make huge logical leaps rather than relying on solid evidence. I was also annoyed that the culprit turned out to be one of the most likely suspects, who we had ruled out as too absurdly obvious. In the end, I'd rather read a good mystery novel which would take less time and effort for a greater payoff.

A very interesting 'game' concept to which the word game can only be applied on a very loose basis. It is more of a collaborative narrative whodunnit experience with lots of clues and deducing. I think it is the most fun if played cooperatively and pondering about who the culprit might be. Sometimes the clue matrix does not really work and there are no clues where there should be clues (in my opinion) and i would not have minded a few more red herrings for good measure, just to make the city of London feel more dynamic and alive with people bustling all over the place. Anyway, interesting game and one of the rare occasions where the theme is perfectly captured in a game.

RATING: 8
An immersive deduction game where you are working with Sherlock Holmes and are presented with a case that needs solving. The game is very thematic and captures the atmosphere of the era well. There is no hand holding as you are given a short story of how the case came to your (or Holmes') attention along with a directory and map of London with the day's newspaper. That is it, now venture forth and solve the case by visiting locations in London and interviewing persons of interest.

If played competitively, the player who solves the case with the least amount of visits/interviews wins. But I have found it more fun for everyone to play cooperatively as we all just sit around the table spitballing ideas about what our next move should be. Once you know the solution, there is no point in playing again which limits the replayability. There are ten cases included with the base game so it will last a decent amount of time before needing more cases. More of a role playing game, this crime mystery game excels at storytelling and is always thoroughly enjoyed.

Three cases done so far. I don't really think of it as a board game, but it's certainly an experience like no other. I love that the game primarily takes place in your head.

The cases themselves vary in quality; it's unfortunate that there are so many typos (and some mistakes that are more significant in the gameplay) that could have been caught with some additional editorial attention. I feel I should mark it down for that, but I'm so enamored with the totally unique gameplay.

You should DEFINITELY look up the fan-made corrections for certain cases, though--BGG user mpascall has a good one for Case 3.

This is more of an activity than a game.  It is very story driven, and you spend most of your time reading.

I would like to point out that there isn't really any deduction in the game.  It's all inference - just like all the movies/tv adaptations of Sherlock Holmes.

You will not spend your time making deductions.  You spend your time trying to gather as much information to build a theory for motive and opportunity - no deduction involved.

My wife and I very much disliked this game.  It's so boring.  We weren't engaged in the stories.  We didn't like the confusing nature of the language (era).  The print is hard to read.  It's just a bad experience.

This game is very reading comprehensive and if you don't like that then you will not enjoy this game.   For me, I'm in the middle with this.  As it is, the game takes a really long time if you want to be thorough. Not only do you have to find who did if but why and other various clues that are case specific to get game points.  Pencil and paper are a must to write notes unless you are really good at memory.  As it is its a good activity and gives a okay story but as a game there are other things I think I'd like to spend 4-5 hours doing because for me it feels at little more like work than fun.

Would recommend this to be played co-operatively.  
Have only tried to solve the first case, which we did abysmally at.  Would recommend that someone else score your progress, so that you can have another crack at a case without knowing too much about how Holmes solves it.
Great social game.

I loved this game when I was a kid, or a teen, can&#039;t quite remember.  I think I&#039;ve been through all published cases, thus limiting replay value.  You have to make brilliant guesses as to which sites to visit to solve the cases as fast as Holmes.

I started a solo game of this and instantly decided it would be so much more fun with others. I had only followed one clue, so I paused it and waited for my wife, Emily, and her dad (whom really likes detective stories). We had a lot of fun talking through the scenario and following clues/leads. We did really well with the answers and could have gotten most of those answers earlier in the investigation. We just didn't know when to stop and how much information would be "enough". The thematic aspects really make you feel like a detective! This was also an introduction to know how it all works and will make future cases easier. I can't wait to do another one.

When this game goes right, it is so incredible, and truly one of the best experiences in gaming. However, when it goes wrong, you feel disappointed and somewhat cheated that you lost 10% of what the game has to offer. The way the points are allocated makes you want to solve the mystery as quickly as possible, but at the same time you want to go everywhere and experience everything the game has to offer. I love playing it, but the fact it only has 10 total plays works against it at times.

I love this game! It is nothing like aything else, I've tried, and it gives a real sense and frustration of detectives work. The use of map, newspaper and directory gives you a real sense of freedom in your investegation, that you don't get from other crime solving games, and I love the fact, that actual crime stories has been written for the game instead of a themeles deduction engine. Have played half the cases and number four and partially number three is below par, but it doesn't ruin the overall impression of an unique gaming experience, everyone should have.

Now I know the argument is that you can't replay this game, so why buy it if you only get 10 scenarios. My only answer is because they are THAT good. I cannot overstate how much I love this game. The only reason it doesn't get a 10 is because I'm yet to hear word on official expansions.

Having said that if you've played this before - act as Game Master for people who haven't. Read the text to them, don't let them see inside the scenario book. They can have notes and the newspaper. Watch as they explore the world and visit places and leads you didn't consider. It's fantastic.

This game was amazing!  So much fun to take on the role of one of Sherlock Holmes' helpers and solve the cases on our own.  We don't normally like games with a lot of story telling, but we love deduction games, and this one was great!  We just wish there were more cases!  But 10 cases (that each lasted 2-3 hours) was more than worth the cost for this game.  The only reason it doesn't get a 10 is because there were definitely some cases that were somewhat broken.  A little more play testing and proofreading could have improved them quite a bit.  Once we played through all the cases, we traded this away for TIME Stories.

We consistently have issues with the flow of the game. At times, it becomes very unclear what you are supposed to do next.

Also, even after you reveal certain information, it is still unclear who did what.

Dead. Solid. Perfect.

For the first time since joining BGG six years ago, I tried to give a game a 10.5! BGG wouldn't allow me to do this, and I understand that it would skew the ratings...but the game deserves it!

This is so much fun as a cooperative game. My family called an intermission, intending to continue the next day, but twenty minutes later my daughter sat down next to me and initiated a conversation sorting through all the possibilities that went on until we all decided to take our chances against Holmes. 

The game plays absolutely fair, but it IS tricky! 

Highly recommended for all who-dunnit fans. The game puts the gamer INTO the mystery!

Great game, but Case 3 and no PDF knock down the rating a bit. A PDF would be useful to print out the newspapers for players before reading the case, the frequently consulted locations, and the map. I find it *very* useful to take notes on the map and case book, rather than a "can't touch the original copy" case book.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
+ This game does a lot with a little: maps, newspapers, directories, and a case booklet combine for an immersive experience of Victorian London. 
+ Fun to see how hypotheses about the crime, and impressions of the characters, develop over time. It does feel like you're creating your own story as you go. 

- This is so far only a comment about case 1, but there's a piece of ill-conceived artwork that we mistook for a clue and spent a lot of time trying to make sense of. I'm fine with red herrings, but this was just a thoughtless mistake on the part of the artists and/or writers. 
- There are also quite a few typos but they so far haven't impeded the playability. 
- Holmes's solution is ridiculous but I get the feeling it's supposed to be that way... 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The only game I know of which doesn't merely have a detective theme but actually has you being a detective. It's very text-heavy, so the reading aloud can become a bit of a chore, but the meat of the game is in the discussion between players. Analysing clues, trying to work out which lead is best to pursue next - it's a game which actually does the detective thing right. Highly recommended, though set aside a long, free afternoon in a private place (it doesn't lend itself to pub play).

Best 2 players coop game experience so far !

It's difficult, we have to discuss and search a lot : we take some notes, we develop a theory, we read and re-read, we think, we are completely lost, we stop and sleep on it... we wake up having a new great idea, check it, see one or two other places and get the extra piece we missed and...
You get it, it's intense, it's immersive and you have a lot of fun (if you love like us detective stories obviously).

We are not so interested in beating Sherlock Holmes which is nearly impossible but we always manage to solve the main case which is a great reward !

This game outclasses everything I played before ... because of its uniqueness! Played it several times with my girlfriend and we enjoyed it very much. We called us Holmes and Watson all the game through, although you actually represent Holmes' little helpers. Equipped with a citymap of London, an address book and a newspaper you dive into the atmosphere of late 19th century. Furthermore the cases are challenging and suspenseful! In the best Sherlock manner!

10. Outstanding. I'll always enjoy playing this game-- as long as the content is new!

That said, this has a surprising amount of content in the box. I hesitated over the cost, because of the perceived lack of replayability. After playing half the content, I have 0 regrets about picking it up and I'd love to have expansions.

I'd initially planned on gifting it or reselling it when I was done, but I'm holding out for more content now.
It's not a flawless game. Some of the case content has issues, mistakes that make cases harder to solve than they should be. Still, there's so much fun to be had trying!

It's a nice, quiet, contemplative group activity.

Picked up the new Ripper standalone and am consequently ready to part with this version.

The Ystari/Asmodee edition has its flaws, but the concept still works, saving the game from its shoddy production. Overwrought fonts, glossy paper (perfect for not reading in times of lamplit evening gameplay), ridiculous typos clearly from lack of editing beyond spellcheck, etc. mar the game. People, for example, go for "carnage rides," an error that can't be explained by keyboard error. "Who might have wanted to kilt him," is asked of an obviously most unfortunate victim. 

The map of London is pretty good, although the numbering system seems screwy, and makes finding places take unneeded time. The writing and names of some of the incidental characters can produce guffaws, but the whole thing maintains a goofy charm while retaining enough of the feel of Holmes and Watson to make for an enjoyable evening.

Upon reflection, it's more fun playing the game in non-scoring mode, with everyone pitching in to soak up as much of the knowledge and atmosphere as possible, rather than rush to conclusions in order to try to beat Holmes.

While this game is fine solo, it's much better with at least one more person. I would give it a higher score, except the third case is ridiculously convoluted. However, for the price and what you get out of it, it's very good.

RATING: 7
I had this one as a kid. I thunk, and I thunk as hard as a I could, but I don't remember solving a single case. But to be fair, I was a kid. The whole idea and presentation was very cool, though. Extremely immersive game. Any fan of Sherlock Holmes should certainly try this game if they can get their hands on it.

UPDATE Aug-6-2009:
My parents apparently discarded this game from their basement, so when an opportunity came to reacquire it through trade I took it.

This is a paragraph-driven game, but unlike other paragraph-based games, this has zero replayability. Once you solve a case if you're lucky you'll forget all about it, because that's the only way you'll play that case again. Other games at least have a roleplaying aspect, and a larger number of paragraphs to reference. So -- it is what it is. Still, the prose is very well done, in the style of Sir Doyle. Your characters don't always ask the questions you're looking for, but that in itself is a clue you can use to solve the case. The cases are genuinely interesting.

This game is perfect for long car trips with a group of friends. Just kick back and bask in the frustration of trying and probably failing to solve a difficult puzzle.

My only complaint with Sherlock is that there are only 10 cases to solve, and obviously, once you've seen them all, the game becomes unplayable. But if you take your time with the cases, you're still going to get a solid 40 or 50 hours of quality play time out of this game. Also, expansions are coming~

#58 on my Top 100 Games of All Time (2015)

I view this one as more of an activity than a game, but it does include a scoring mechanism where you see how well you did in solving the case as compared to Sherlock. This is a co-op, but a much different experience than others as you are reading through a casebook to try and figure out what is going on. You can visit different locations on the map of London that will give you more information, but the more places you travel, the lower your score will be. I would make for a horrible detective, but it's fun to try!

This game is brutal. While I appreciate the mystery solving process, I feel like Sherlock Holmes does so at an unrealistic pace. I also feel like the goal of the game is to explore as little of it as possible to ensure a better score. Why would a designer spend SO much time writing flavor text and sprinkling clues just to reveal to the players that the killer was the doorman at the beginning of the story and then punish you with less points because you wandered around town reading for 2 hours while Sherlock Holmes found him in his first 3 moves. That is not a spoiler, just saying... we are 2 campaigns in and I'm not sure if I'm going to have the patience to see the rest of the campaigns through.

Sherlock might be our favorite game of all time. For me it is a toss up, but I would strongly consider this for my top spot. It is a ludicrously enjoyable activity for two people to spend the evening working through together, and though we rarely come close to beating Sherlock, solving the cases ourselves is always an incredibly rewarding process. The game is unique in play style, and the production quality on it is fantastic. We will happily keep purchasing and playing Consulting Detective games as long as they keep publishing them.

Egy London térkép, egy helyi újság és egy rövid történet így indul a nyomozás a Sherlock Holmes társasban. A játékosok Londonban próbálják együttesen vagy egymás ellen vetélkedve megfejteni az adott rejtélyt, jó esetben a nagy nevű detektívnél kevesebb utánajárással. A játékot úgy kell elképzelni, mint a régi Kaland Játék Kockázat könyveket. Minden lényeges helyszínhez tartozik egy rövid történetrész, amiből a fontos dolgokat leszűrve lehet közelebb jutni az ügy megoldásához. A KJK-val ellentétben itt nincs harc és kiesni sem lehet. Amikor a játékos úgy érzi mindent tud és megfejtette a rejtélyt, akkor a kaland végén található kérdésekre válaszolva pontozhatja a teljesítményét. A SHCD nem igazán társasjáték abban a tekintetben, hogy a játék szinte csak olvasásból áll. Akik szeretik a XIX. század Angliáját és történelmét, szeretik a dedukciót azok biztosan jól fognak szórakozni az alapjátékhoz tartozó 10 kaland során. A játék csak erős angoltudással játszható. Egy-egy kaland csak egyszer játszható. A játéknak a pechje esetemben, hogy a TIME Stories után próbáltam, így nekem annál kisebb élményt adott a puritánsága és behatárolt történelmi része miatt.

The case I've played (first one) worked well enough; I solved it and it was satisfying and clever.

However, while I prefer board games to computer and video games, I typically feel that way because of the [i]strengths[/i] of the format -- and all this game does is highlight the weaknesses.

It's essentially a single player game that would work 1000% better as a computer game. Except in that medium, it'd have way more competition and be below mediocre.

The books etc and presentation of the "game" is really cool though.

RATING: 8
Complexity: Medium
Players:  1-8 (probably best with 1-3)
Games Played: 10/10

I don't really know how to classify this game.  It's essentially ten Sherlock Holmes stories written in a choose-your-own-adventure format.  It's also really freaking hard.  Even without trying to beat Sherlock, you have to read carefully and piece the clues together.  If I have one complaint, it's that the game discourages exploration by penalizing you for taking too many steps, and as a consequence, it can be difficult to know when to stop exploring.  It is a terribly exhausting mental exercise but at the end of the day, it is quite a lot of fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
We played our first game, and it was quite a bit of fun, although we did have some difficulties finding some of the people/locations in the directory. the back and forth discussion between the players as we narrow down the clues is quite fun.

RATING: 7.5
Fun. Occasionally frustrating because you have to read through old newspapers to find clues and I find this slows it down to suit OCD types more than regular players. Also frustrating because some cases are just plain silly. Also frustrating (!) because while you may have a good reason for something unless it's specifically in the game it's not valid. I know this is part of the game but we soemtimes had good ideas that were so far off the mark because of some silly clue we would never have spotted was missed.

Great map and graphic style throughout helps immersion.

All in all I'm so glad this game exists and I wish more like this did.

This certainly stretches the boundary of a game, and really almost more into an activity, but nonetheless, it's a well-crafted mystery you're trying to solve. I love how open-ended things are, and that you can travel all over London looking for various clues, and the theme just really comes through. Definitely fun to play with a couple of other people so you can put your minds together.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I really really enjoyed this one. Our score was abysmal, however. We had this idea that the clues were trying to trick us, so we kept getting more and more evidence to ensure we weren't being duped. As it turns out, there was no trickery. We'll know better going forward. 

I will say, though, that it kind of takes the fun out of it to try to use as few clues as possible.... doing the interviews and gathering the clues is all the fun!

different.... I was quite surprised when I realized, that you are not moving over the map, it just helps you. It takes too long, but it is not bad!

RATING: 7
Commenting on this game after one or two plays is like commenting on a compilation of short stories after reading one.  It's more like a series of interactive stories than a game.  It's less a game to analyze than an activity to enjoy together.

We played our first case with another couple who owned the game.  Our hosts were on the third case, so we went with that one. We didn't actually solve the case, but I later discovered that it wasn't our fault. We were playing what is reputed to be the only "broken" case of the 10. In a way, it was a good one to play. My girlfriend and I hadn't played before, but she enjoyed the game very much. When I told her it was supposed to be the worst of the lot, her enthusiasm only increased. It was a very satisfying evening and prompted us to get a copy for ourselves.

My main complaint about the game is that there are a lot of typos and translation errors.  Many of them are so obvious that it's hard to imagine how they could have slipped through even a passing read somewhere in the editing process.  For such a text-heavy game, it's disappointing to realize that evidently no editing was done for both the initial reprint and the second printing.  Worse yet, some of the errors affect the solutions.  There's no excuse for that.  It's a significant drawback that merits mention, though it only moderately dampens my enthusiasm.

More serious than the typos, as annoying as they are, are the errors in the cases themselves.  Case #3 and #6 are broken in that the solutions don't make sense of the clues.  Players who might find this frustrating would do well to consult the forums on BGG before playing.  We avoided them out of fear of spoiling the cases.  In retrospect, we shouldn't have.  In particular, I highly recommend the excellent Irregular Handbook thread.

RATING: 6
You have to be very focused for a long time in this game.
You can't verify all the details, so you have to suggest, make hypothesis for the final solution. And even in the final solution, there will be some points unresolved (like in the real world). 
So, play with this on mind: don't try to resolve all the details, just focus on the essential things, and don't take too much time to stop and suggest a solution, or you will explore all the tracks and lose all the points to Sherlock Holmes, only to become frustrated in the end because not all the details have been resolved.

Other point: every case is "one shot", so you also are torn in half between exploring all the tracks or explore only the main paths but missing some clues...

Wanted this for soooo long and when I finally bought it and played the first game, it turned out to be an overall, above average experience. Maybe I am not British enough for this game, or the requirement for attention to detail (in terms of words and reading in between the lines) is too much for me.

Still, a lovely exercise in deduction.

RATING: 9.5
'Game' that tells you exiting stories of murder and mystery in sherlocks london. 

It's so engaging that if you don't end the case in the evening, it keeps haunting you the whole evening. 
Other cases keep you in amazement while you ponder over the evidence and testimonies that you gather as you go along. Even after the case has ended, you still keep thinking about it for a couple of days.

One thing we learned was to forget about focusing on beating Sherlock's score with minimum leads. It messes the game experience up. 

For one, you  would want to jump to early to the conclusion and therefore more chance to have the wrong answer. You blew the case and the case is still lost, since you now know the perpetrator. 

Secondly, you miss out on the interesting moments, and the additional story lines within the case. So take your time and enjoy it.

Played through the first case with my wife. We where pretty crappy detectives… :D

We had a lot of fun though, and we definitely want to play this more. We just need to take the time to do it…

UPDATE 2017-07-05: The main reason this is an 8 and not a 9 is that it's so heavy to play. I really like the game, but it's so hard, and requires so much mental focus for such a long time, that we often choose another game to play, simply because we don't feel up to the task. And while set-up and tear-down is virtually non-existent, you can't really leave the game mid-scenario, because you'll have forgotten most of the ever-important details when you come back to it…
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Clever concept, well crafted. The designers love for the Holmes tradition is manifest. The only drawback in execution is that it is sometimes difficult to look up clues without accidentally seeing things from other clues that you're not yet entitled to see.

The only remedy for that would have been to make large cards for each clue, rather than put them together in the binder, but I'm sure that would have been prohibitive from a production costs standpoint.

It's a choose your own adventure book where you can go to whatever chapter you choose, but each chapter your read cost you points.
It's great idea and it's great fun if you have the time and deduction power.

This is a fantastic... heck, I almost don't want to call it a game. It was immediately embraced by my SO and her grown, nongamer kids. We have finished four (or five?) cases now and have little mannerisms and quotes that we keep tossing at each other that came from those sessions. Brilliant!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Consulting Detective is like no game I've ever played. I'm not sure it's fair to call it a game at all. In many ways it's more like a "choose your own adventure" book; and if it succeeds, it's because it avoids the fatal flaw of most gamebooks -- that by practical necessity each node usually has no more than four edges.

In a choose your own adventure, if someone mentions a Mr. Smith, it'll tell you, "to speak to Mr. Smith, turn to page 5". In Consulting Detective, the paragraphs are entirely divorced from the navigation. You can find Mr. Smith, of course, but you'll have to look him up in the phone book. This is where it becomes more of a game and less of a book: if there are five Smiths and you choose wrong, you waste a unit of game-time, which allows your opponent(s) to get ahead -- the fastest to solve the crime wins.

There are also some clues in the day's newspaper or discoverable by examining the map.

I don't enjoy it as a competitive exercise, though, as it fails both mechanically (everyone has to share the paragraphs, everyone has to read the newspaper) or socially (everyone is silently reading the paragraphs, newspaper). As a cooperative or solo exercise, it's a lot of fun -- like being in a mystery novel. If you don't read closely and take notes, it's entirely possible to never solve the crime, and even if you do you sometimes have to backtrack after chasing a red herring.

Solving it [i]with[/i] someone, though -- maybe taking turns reading out paragraphs -- is just as enjoyable, and a fine way to spend a rainy afternoon.

This isn't a board game. It is something that has me lying in bed at night wondering where I missed a clue, what I didn't see in the paper, what details I missed when questioning someone.

RATING: 6
Extremely open and easy to get into, quite an interesting game though it can feel like an exercise at times (especially when you're chasing your tail).

Poor English copy editing, which is really important in this design, from Ystari Games. How they managed to screw-up a few cases (mixing and matching only portions of updated solutions from the original 80's text, so Case #3 is effectively broken, for example) is beyond me. Even the map and Allies location codes are wrong. 

Great concept for a game and a unique experience to be sure, but structurally flawed in a few places - inexcusable for a release first published in 1981.

Works OK as a solitaire experience (just don't expect to beat Holmes).

The game is immensely fun when you solve the mysteries. But this being Sherlock Holmes, the inferences you need to make to solve the mysteries can sometimes approach silliness - if your group begins to think about a particular mystery the wrong way, you're going to fail. In that sense, the game can be really frustrating.

This feels much more linear and confined than Gumshoe does. Everything is simplified, even the map and locations. As a result, it doesn't feel as immersive.

Oddly, in order to win the game (against Sherlock) you have to make massive assumptions and not chase down leads. I suppose that's vaguely thematic, but feels incomplete.

Don't get me wrong, I still like SH:CD, but it doesn't compare to Gumshoe.

This game is like nothing I have ever played before.  It reminds me of the logic puzzles that I used to do a lot.  My wife and I both enjoyed it immensely.  The hard part is to remember certain differences between Sherlock's time and our own, and example is that now cigarette can be bought anywhere compared to the use of tobacconists in Sherlock's time.  Great game, highly recommend.

I've only played one case, but wow, it was a really really neat and interesting experience.  

Not really so much a board game, as you can play it sitting on the couch or whatever.  If this was a fully re-playable game, it would be way way up there, but also probably wouldn't give you the same experience.

For 10 cases, I believe this is a great great experience, then you can pass it on to the next person, or hope that expansions or fan cases get made.

RATING: 4
After playing 2 cases, we decided that this game is too much reading and too predetermined for us (Sherlock is too OP). We don't find the excitement to solve the case as we weren't any where close, in fact, we find it boring. You can beat around the bushes for a long time without having any break through. The writings make a good story but never lead us to anywhere useful, we were mostly clueless of where to check next and even when we came up with a reasonable suspect, it would take us to another dead end the 10th time with a paragraph almost as long as the opening story: and then we lost interest. It mostly felt like a whole night wasted and achieved nothing at the end of the game.

It might be a good game for the right mind but not for my group.

A game where you solve "real" mysteries. By real, I mean that you find clues, "interview" witnesses, and try to figure out what happened. Limited to a fixed number of scenarios which cannot be replayed, similar to choose your own adventure or "programmed learning" books. The mystery writing is excellent, with a number of side mysteries you can solve for bonus points. Play is probably best at about four, but it is a cooperative game with no real player limit.

It's really more of a choose-your-own-adventure novel than it is a board game, but it's very well done and a lot of fun.  The biggest downside is that there is zero replayability after you've done all the cases.  But, it's a very good ~20 hours of enjoyment, then you can pass the game onto someone else to enjoy.

Update:  This game is really hard, to the point where I feel like I have no chance sometimes.  Knocking it down from an 8 to a 7 because I have left the last two cases feeling hopeless and unsatisfied.

The following contains NO SPOILERS.

CASE 1: Got tricked. I was on the right track but then I found an alternative motive which somehow convinced me and I made a wrong bet. So close. Now I know to check all the leads before making any assumptions.
CASE 2: So, I was stupid. I got the killer and understood much else, even some of the little things, but the motive escaped me. Now, of course the solution was logical and the clues were plain to see but I still didn't get it. Frustrating and exhilarating at the same time. Can't wait for the next one. I made the decision to investigate every case thoroughly and not to compete with Holmes. Two reasons: Holmes can't be beat and the cases are so well written that I want to enjoy them fully.
CASE 3: A bit easier case, although part of the case was spoiled by a case of The Mansion Murders but maybe not by that much, the solution was quite plain to see. Solved the case and knew almost everything about it. 
CASE 4: Solved it. Good case, a bit complicated at first sight but not really after that. Only bits of the coded message went unsolved.
CASE 5: Solved, quite easy especially when compared to some of the other cases. 
CASE 6:Solved. 
CASE 7: The Thames Murders was one of the best cases of the Consulting Detective. Nicely complicated case which made me really scrap my head until I understood and admitted that it really had happened what I thought had happened. Solved completely.
CASE 8:Good case again. Quite simple especially when comparing it to the case that preceded it, but interesting nonetheless. Mostly solved, a small detail escaped me.
CASE 9: At beginning this was quite easy and I realized some basic details very soon. Best part of the case was how it surprised me with bitter tenderness. Very good case.
CASE 10: Like the previous, some details, even major, were easily grasped at the beginning of the case - but the rest of the details were very nicely done and made the case truly excellent. I really liked the motive, which, I must admit, espaced me.

Consulting Detective is definately one of the very best and without a doubt the most original game I have ever have an honour to play. Although all the cases weren't that deep or hard as one could wish, they were very immersive and very well written. I was glued to the game from the moment I started a new case and was thinking about clues even when I wasn't playing. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It seems odd that this is considered a board game. The only mechanics are reading, discussing and note-taking. It is much more of a literary activity than a board game. 

In my first game I was a bit bored during the first hour or so (whilst being read aloud to with less than gripping material), but it got more enjoyable once we had a few leads and started putting clues together. In the end we got the right answers to all 8 questions, which was very gratifying. We only visited 4 more locations than Sherlock, so we got a decent score too.

I've played it a handful of times now and while it makes for a somewhat interesting activity, I don't come away feeling like I've played a board game, so it's a little unsatisfactory as a way to spend game night in that regard. I have to be in a certain mood to play this, would probably never suggest it myself, and have to accept that I just need to sit through the boring part to get to the good part. My primary gaming partner/opponent loves it though, so we're gradually working our way through the scenarios.

We finally "won" (not besting Sherlock, but at least figuring most details out) on our fourth case.  This has been a great purchase already, and we're not 50% of the way through yet. UPDATE: After the sixth case, this is getting more frustrating.  We've not every gotten remotely close to solving a case completely. The "proper" way to solve the most recent one seemed total BS to us. Changing rating from 8 to 7. Will somewhat glad to finish this and trade it off after a very promising start.

An extremely cool and totally unique game.  Some of the scenarios would play much better solo than co-op.  (Really?  I've got to sit here while you solve a cipher?  Really?!)  Then again, most of the fun is brainstorming the clues together and reading out the encounters in bad accents, so I'd want it to shine best as a co-op.

RATING: 9
This is a unique game.  As a Homicide Detective (in real life), I find that it deviates from reality in that real detectives follow-up on multiple paths of investigation while Sherlock Holmes does not. He'll have a hunch and follow only one path, avoiding divergent evidence paths and getting right to the point.Because you are racing against him, you are forced to do the same.  We have found that he occasionally presents findings that his case summary clue path (in reconstruction) never reveals.  With these snivellings aside, it's a rollicking trip through Victorian era London and the Holmes mythos.  I've enjoyed it a great deal and will regret when we inevitably run out of cases... there will be no replay value once all of the investigations have been conducted.

RATING: 9
An incredible mystery-solving platform that is one of the most engaging co-op game experiences you'll ever have, at least, on the good cases anyway.  Unfortunately, there are a few cases that don't hold up to scrutiny, which is a major problem when the goal of the game is analytic deduction.

Most of these are just so much fun to play. I love the conversations we have and the clues we individually latch on to and feel compelled to chase down. It's really satisfying when everything works just right.

....But so many of the cases are broken. Many follow illogical steps to reach their conclusion. Granted, the old Sherlock Holmes books were based on a lot of assumptions as well, but I crave something more scientifically sound and valid. The Mystified Murderess in particular was a huge letdown where it was more about the flavour of the writing than the motive or known abilities of the culprit that led to the murderer.

A great deduction game! Each story is unique, it grabs your attention from page #1, steps taken during the investigation makes you feel like being part of the team, splashing your feet in the rainy London streets.

Although this is NOT a re-playable game, it is really worth its value. Plus, more cases are printed (although currently only available in french).

9/10 due to the dreaded Case #3.

Good game if you like murder-mystery type games and/or collaborative games. I really like the art and feel--they do a good job of transporting the player to Victorian London.

Thankfully, BGG users have posted errata for these cases.

So totally unique compared to other games.  Its a lot of fun to sit on the couch and pontificate on these fictional cases and attempt to solve them.  It's a shame that after the 10 cases you are essentially done, but it seems like the expansions may be getting a translation as well.  Either way I'd say 2-3 hours a case or more if you really take your time, gives you about 25 hours of unique game.  I think everyone should give it a try.

I'm a big Sherlock Holmes fan and this game is the closest you'll get to a Holmesian gaming experience.  The only problem with it is that to achieve that level of experience it has zero replay value unless you have a really bad long-term memory.  I'm hoping to pick up some of the expansions (and especially the new Jack the Ripper adventures) for this soon to build up my case book.

Reading books is a wonderful but lonely business. Though you can discuss them with other readers, at the moment of their height, when the narrative fully engulfs you and mesmerises you, you are completely alone unable to share the feelings they create on you with anyone.

Enter Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective, and you now have 10 detective stories that you can literally live with your friends/gaming group.
That is a remarkable goal for a boardgame, and with strong stories like Tin Soldier, it becomes a remarkable achievement.

The game is simple at its premise, yet undeniably efficient at what it does. By giving you complete freedom, it detaches you from the "board game" aspect of it and allows you to be fully drawn to its story. Just by reading the rules you may wonder, can't I just point out at a random place on the map and solve the case with pure luck? Sure you can but you can also abandon your work to try to win the lottery - does this make your work meaningless?

The overflow of information really creates a world that is begging for deduction, and the players will find themselves digging into fully detailed and amazing newspapers trying to find relevant information on their case, reading half readable personal notes in the writing style of the era, going through flavorful dialogs and smart interrogations again and again trying to deduce their meaning, debating on how to proceed next and forming theories on the solution of the case.

Overall all players are constantly enganged, and unless you have some detective genious inside your group that somehow solves anything himself you'll find that everyone involved will contribute his bit as the story moves on.

The goal of the game is to solve the case (correctly) as fast as you can and thus it really is a mental challenge. It makes your every move debated and meaningful. Sure you can roam Londom, visit 50 locations and obviously you'll have solved the case but the thing is you'll really feel good if you do it faster. Being half as good as Sherlock himself is something that is hard earned in this game, and therefore worth it. (unlike say, Time Stories which is much less challenging and more "live the experience" in its focus. Sherlock btw and imo, is better even in the "live the experience" aspect.)

Overall I loved Sherlock Holmes. It successfully blends the world of boardgames with the world of books, and it does so with 10 apparently great detective stories. Definitely an experience I recommend. Really looking forward to play more.

[thing=2511][/thing] is, well, an unusual game.

First, the amount of rules: read the introduction of the case. Now, go wherever you want whenever you want (following the map by using the Directory, which contains the adresses of everyone of interest, and also the adress of several business locations) and talk (read) with the people there. Read the newspaper of the day, if pleases you. Also, you might want to talk with some fine folks that usually are aware of things (like Mycroft, journalists, go to the morgue or Scotland Yard, and such). Now, also whenever you want, you can return to present your fiddings regarding the case to Sherlock. The booklet will contain some questions, each will be worth an amount of points. Then, for every location you went above the number of those that Sherlock did, you will lose 5 points. Now, compare the amount you achieve with that of Holmes (he always gets 100 points). Then, you can feel good or bad, depending on how well you did. And that is it. Well, less than it, actually, since my last bit of feelings is more a thing I added. That is all the rules.

In every case you will have at your disposal: the booklet of the case (you can always consulte passages you read), the newspaper, the Directory (the adress of many things and persons in London) and the map of London, and this one, by the way, one of the players (we played in 4 people) thought it was utterly unnecessary, since how close one thing is to other, or the relation of one to another, wasn't playing any roll in the case. But then, in the end, the game hit us hard in the nutsack for not using it properly (you know, as a map). So great.

[thing=2511][/thing] is, probably, one of the most pure experiences of playing that one can have. There is no board (the map is not a board, you don't take action on it, you use it, as I pointed out, as a reference), no meeples, no pieces, no tokens, no money, no cards, no keeping rounds (though, you can see every new location as a new round), no gameplay time as we usually time it. What there are: reading and talking. After the reading of what happened in the case we started discussing: where to go? With whom to talk? What information we had? What means this or that? What about visiting the school for girls? And after we decided to go to a place, and the reading of what occurred there, we returned to the discussions. And now what? What we take it from this? Which lines/leads we now can follow? Usually quite a few, but it was worth our time to follow most of them? Which was more likely to actually advance our case? What was the place - or the person - with the best chances of providing clues? We compared notes, explored options, created scenarios - this because of this and this. Yes... but what about [i]this[/i]? Well, [i]this[/i] I can't explain properly right now. So, which place or person would shed light on this matter? I think this one. But wouldn't he just say what we already know? Then, we can take a chance here. Yes, it can work. And things went this way during the whole game. [thing=2511][/thing] is a game of pure deduction, taking notes, clashing options.

A play of [thing=2511][/thing] ends when the players want. You can visit 10 places, 50 or two. The decisions is yours, always. You know you are "running" against Holmes, but you did not know how many places/persons he went/talked to. I doubt that in any of the cases Sherlock needed to go to 50 places to solve the case, but the main question here is: which is worth more - beating Holmes or solving the case? For us it was solving the case, and only after we had a solid overall view of most of the things in the case, and a scenario that answered (for us) most of our own questions, that we went to see the end result. And this can't be taken lightly: once you read the solution of the case, you probably won't be able to ever playing it again since the challenge will be gone. There aren't any variations in the set up, nor event cards, nor different characters to take - the case will always be the same, the result will be the same, the clues will be in the same places.

So, yes, [thing=2511][/thing] has a "due date" - after the 10 cases, it is over. Except by reasons of really weak memory, disease and amnesia, even many years after playing you won't be able to fully enter a play of one of the cases (since, you might start not remembering things, but then something clicks, you remember, and now you basically can't participate). However, this is all that much important? There are lots of games I bought and probably won't clock 10 plays of them. But, more relevant, a game that gives you 10 memorable experiences? I can't, as up to right now, say that it will actually be 10 memorable experiences, but the first case was, and I doubt that the others will fall short.

The amount of work of the authors in the cases is awe inspiring - the newspaper and so many places with informations (most not relevant, but there, anyway). The only thing I wished it was present in the game was an internal clock - but I know this would make the game way more linear, so I'm fine without it. However, for those that want to enjoy something in the likes of this, you can download some of the Sherlock Holmes Solo Mysteries (a game book series) [url=http://www.abandonia.com/pt/gamebooks#Sherlock+Holmes+Solo+Mysteries]here[/url] - or go after the actual books (but they somewhat old).

It was a night of talks, exploring in our minds. We visited places, talked to people - and even going to only 9 different places, still the play lasted for almost four hours! The play reminded me of when, in college, we discussed books in the class of literary analysis - many views trying to reach an overall acceptance of the intent of the whole thing. 

Anyway, I'm totally excited to tackle the next mistery! Baker Street Irregulars to the work!

Have finished all 10 cases in the base game. This game is amazing.  There are some issues with mismatches between the clues and the solution that are frustrating, but it doesn't interfere with you solving the case, which is the real game.  Hands down the best co-op game, because it is so hard.  Also works well playing a half hour here and there for those with tight schedule.

Imersive and intelligent.

Unfortunately no more edited. And then limited in cases to solve...
A collector that each fan of sherlock and watson should have home.

An excellently done, well-themed, fun, cooperative deduction game with limited replay value (but several fine expansions).

Mostly an experience game, as Holmes (whom you are "competing" against) cheats! ;-)

You get 10 cases in the base set and you can really only play each of them once.

A unique and beautifully designed game.  I recommend playing in teams of 2, so you can discuss your theories aloud, yet still have the pressure of not wasting turns.  The game is wonderful when you are desparate to solve the case first--if you just go everywhere, it's kinda lame.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A great mystery deduction game flawed by the fact that some cases have lame solutions. Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective does not lend itself to replay. It serves the theme brilliantly and is well written. I recommend you play cooperatively and use your best British accent when reading the clues.

The game is great.  Great atmosphere, unique mechanics, suspense, and even though it is a little longer you can put it aside for a while and come back to the case you were working on.

Difficult to rate this beast...

I really would like to love this. It is overall well executed: has great atmosphere and unique game play. BUT I was super disapointed in the ending of our story in our scenario. There were 3 main motives/aspects how the murder could have happened - in the end only one of these was anyway relevant! No connection between these 3 things. This is unacceptable for me!! If you try to make sense of the story, it is VERY cheap to assume that the crazy unlikely hints are noway connected... DEUS EX MACHINA all over it :/

One of my favorite games now. It's a lot of fun and throws you right into the feeling of actually being a detective. The only issue I have is that you don't have control over what you find at the locations you go to. I don't think there's a way to resolve that, at least not in this system.

RATING: 7.5
SH Consulting Detective is an extremely hard game to rate. Each case has a certain flow of investigating, getting stuck, and rising excitement as you find the last piece of the puzzle.

But it all comes down to the ending. The game offers several leads that are always available, such as Scotland Yard, the criminology lab, or the morgue. But the list is comprised of some 15 leads, and it's almost never clear which one is going to have useful information. Sometimes the criminology lab has the deceased possessions, while other times Scotland Yard is holding them. Sometimes you'll need to consult with your criminal contact and he'll straight up give you the criminals name, while other times he'll have no clue about the criminal activities going on. In almost every case 1 or 2 of these contacts is essential to solving the case, while the other 13 or so are completely useless.

It's frustrating when Holmes jumps between these omnipresent leads, always knowing exactly which one will have the treasure trove of information needed to continue. Especially since, in general, none of the case specific leads will point you towards one of Holmes contacts. When you solve 75% of a case, but miss the final piece because you didn't bother talking to contact number 13, it feels unrewarding, like the game is cheating.

But some of the cases are really rewarding to play. The cases where the endings feel like a natural conclusion of the events of the case are the best, where if you solve the case it's because you used your deductive insight wisely, or if you lose it's because you missed an angle of the case, not because you missed a lead. If every case were like that this would score a 9 easily. Unfortunately, every case is written differently and not all of them are equal.

Very exciting and challenging. Feels like the game isn't herding you and you need to think outside of the box. Hard to rate, I enjoyed it a lot but felt it could maybe be even better. But as the game is unique and can best be compared to murder mystery dinner games, where it clearly outshines those I have played. Thus going with my feeling of it being a 9.

I like it and will play all the cases, but I don't see it quite like a "game"; it's closer to reading a book for me; maybe as a "coop", although I'm not sure I would enjoy it that way. I need to read, search the index/map to stay involved, so I think I'll keep it a solo experience.

[+] not-quite-a-game; need concentration & quiet time; an interesting experience.
[-] replayability limited to once per case; 

UP: I have now played all 10 cases, with a wide range of understanding (from -65pts to +65pts with all perfect anwsers). I've also played 5 or 6 "free" cases (from magazines or fans), not sure I will buy any more.

Sherlock somehow knows the solution after only talking to a few people.  There is no way to know for sure who the bad guy is, and in fact the more digging you do the more ambiguous all of the clues get.  You basically have to guess between a few suspects and hope you guessed right because Sherlock is magic and just knows.

Choose your own adventure for adults, with better writing.  It's corny and silly quite frequently, but it IS interesting to try to figure out the mystery, and the narrative unfolds in a very compelling way.  It's just the right amount of difficulty, too.  It's tough to figure out the case with a good score, but doable.  First case we dallied around and got the equivalent of a D- if we were keeping score based on letter grades.  And we thought we were doing well.  Grab up the new reprint, because this is absolutely one of the best narrative games out there.  Works best if you're willing to overlook some of the most egregiously Victorian moments of race, creed, and sex politics.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Solve the mystery game, where you read various paragraphs in a large book, decide who to talk to or where to visit next, which gives a new paragraph to read. So, you build up the story in this way, and eventually, if you're attentive enough, you piece together the various items you've read to solve the mystery.

Lots of reading of course, but the fun part is deciding what to do next. "Let's go talk to the office manager", or "What's the coroner have to say about that?"

The only drawback is that with just 10 cases in the game, you're pretty much going to have to track down the expansions once you run through them.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
To be quite frank, this game just isn't for me. For the first case, we included the murderer on our initial shortlist of suspects, but we then ruled that person out because that person seemed way too obvious. (The person's motive was admittedly different from what we originally suspected; however, that didn't particularly matter to me.) In addition, there were at least two places where our group wanted to follow leads, but we weren't able to do so simply because we couldn't find the locations on the asininely small map. I feel like by the time a group becomes more familiar with the map, they will have gone through all the cases and that knowledge will be pointless. At this stage, I'm looking for games that are both entertaining and long-lasting. This game offers neither, nor does it have anything unique enough that I would be willing to overlook its flaws.

One solo play to practice the game before trying with a group. Very promising game, more like an investigation than a game, really. Not easy by any means, and it is so well written, that you might be lured to just investigate more and more and not trying to solve quickly (the more you investigate, the less points you get).

There are 10 cases in the box, and you can play each case once, because they scripted - they are almost like novels, but you can choose the parts (clues) you are interested in most.

Second play with a group of 5, still the solution was a mystery us, but the it was fun. If I think as a game, this might not be very good, but as a mystery or riddle, this is great. Some hints are obvious, most are not.

Third play, solo this time. Now I got quite a good picture of the crime, but the final things were mysteries. Ended up investigating lots of unnecessary places in the end while looking for something useful. Best as a solo or with a small enthuastic group?

Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective it's great fun. I had a blast playing it solo and taking my time solving the cases. They just stay in your head. You get a feeling of solving real mysteries, with great components like newspapers and map of London. I would give it an 9 for gamplay and fun, but some printing mistakes and usage of different names in cases and the catalog with Adresses can be a little annoying. Stil, this is an uniqe experiance, everyone who like mysteries and Sherlock Holmes should try this.

A delightful mystery game with many different paths to coming to the correct facts about a case. This title is more about the experience of trying to solve the case than the actual "score" you get in doing so (for my group anyway). Provides a wonderful cooperative discussion piece for the evening with well thought out and translated (mostly) challenges.

Finished all 10 cases and passed the game along to another gamer to enjoy. Provided over 20 hours of unique entertainment for my wife and I to enjoy. Played a couple of cases with 4 players and it was equally enjoyable.

A detective game where you try to solve a mystery together.
The game consists of 10  cases, a map of london, and a dictionary. You take turns choosing which lead to follow. To follow a lead, you read the matching paragraph in the casebook which gives you clues to the solution. When you feel you have solved the case you compare your solution with the Sherlock Holmes solution.

This one is unique, and not for everyone.  It is kind of like work, but in a cool way.  My wife and I play it together occasionally.  There is a group of fun little mysteries to solve.  It definitely has a finite shelf life though… once you finish the cases included in the game, there isn't much replay-ability, although I hear there are some fan-created cases.   

Update as of 6/15/17: We took a long time off from this game and decided to give it another go. I think I may not be one of the people this game is for. The feeling of work outweighs the feeling of fun or satisfaction for me. I don't even think it feels like a game. If I never played this game again, I'd be ok with that.

Story telling, murder mystery deduction game. I would also add role playing because the game materials immerse you in theme and I challenge you not to feel like a murder investigator. I loved detective stories growing up and I enjoy story telling games so I knew this would be a joy... and it is. Ten very well concocted scenarios, daily newspapers are a brilliant touch, a map of London, and a directory of suspects. And with most story telling games, the game lasts for as long as you want it to.  Thank God that they give you Sherlock's break down of each crime so that you can see all the stuff you missed.

Aside from a scratch on the front of the box, this is in like-new condition. We've only played the first two scenarios, so many of the components haven't even been touched.

Disappointing, absurd conclusions despite the beautiful materials and storytelling. Sherlock just makes extreme jumps in logic and relies completely on circumstantial evidence.

While I do enjoy playing, I feel that it is virtually impossible to actually outwit Sherlock and I don't find the answers to be very logical.

The joy of working with your friends to tease out this puzzle can't easily be shared, but is thrilling. I like this so much, I don't even begrudge the few hiccups from translations.

Quote from one of our games: "Who would have thought spending Saturday night trying to solve a murder was going to be so much fun!"

Really fun game to play with my girlfriend. A case takes us an hour or two, and I especially like that the solution is given after that, giving a sense of closure which can lack in, for instance, T.I.M.E Stories.

Probably one of my favorite couples games.

There is no board, just a book of text and a paper map. You really have to get the juices flowing to have a shot and a decent score in this one. Highly recommend that everyone try it at least once for the experience.

- Can be a bit long if players dont agree what to do
- Each story is a 'one shot'
- Let's be honest guys... Sherlock uses cheats !

An old game, a great one. It really makes you feel like a detective. 
I would suggest no more than 4 players.

One of the most unique gaming experiences I've ever had.  It's basically an interactive crime/mystery novel, with you as the PI.  You decide who to investigate, you decide where to investigate, and you put the pieces together. I do wish the map was a bit more durable feeling, maybe printed on cardstock instead of poster paper, but quite honestly we haven't used it much anyway.  The quiz format is pretty open ended, which is good, because then you can't be right just by virtue of guessing the correct suspect from a list of multiple choice answers. This does lead to some ambiguity in the scoring, but we'll probably ignore the scoring going forward anyway. It's just not that important in the grand scheme of the awesome experience that is this game.

In a similar vein to TIME Stories the scoring rules incentivise the player not to explore the case to the fullest in favour of an Occam's Razor, Holmesian approach. Use the scoring rules if you have any interest in the competitive aspect or if you want some pressure to finish the game within a reasonable time frame. If you have all day or you are happy with splitting the case across multiple plays then ignore scoring and absorb the cases to their fullest. Given the "one-shot" nature of the cases you'll get more value for money ignoring the scoring.

No me parece un mal juego, ni pasa nada porque "sólo" tenga 10 misiones, pero soy muy flojo para leer, nunca sabes lo que va a durar una partida, no valgo para los juegos cooperativos, no tiene materiales para andar toqueteando (ni plástico ni cubos) durante la partida...

This is a great game when you either want to play, but have nobody go game with, or when a few friends want to solve a mystery together. I can definitely recommend it. The Swedish edition that came in a binder was fantastic! And since I no longer can find my copy, I'd love to trade for one.

We have the Sleuth Publications Boxed Edition and this will always be the best version "to have" in our opinion.

RATING: 7
Entirely logic-based. I enjoyed the game, but it required a substantial amount of reading. While I did feel as if I were part of the detective team, I felt a bit aimless at times. A friend and I spent three hours painstakingly collecting clues and taking notes, and we really overthought the answer. Two or three particular interviews would have been enough. We saw the correct answer almost immediately and thought it was too simple of an explanation.

RATING: 8
Solving the who and why of Sherlock Holmes mysteries with as few clues as possible is very fun if you are a fan of mystery games.  While not nearly as much of a choose your own adventure game as TIME Stories the puzzle solving felt similar and I found I didn't miss the dice or time jumps at all.  This should more than tide over my group between TIME Stories adventures being released.

A wonder of a game, but more of a mystery solving adventure than a game. However, I find that it's exceedingly difficult to get people to play it. Probably an excellent solo game however, and a rewarding experience. Would recommend to Sherlock fans, though watch out for the typos! They seem to pop up in quite a few places.

 The Ystari Games edition that I've got has changed a number of cases without proper editorial oversight. The bad translation from the French doesn't bother me, it's the unneeded changes that literally break the logic of the cases. Pointless.
 About the translation from French - It's not clear why the game was translated from French into English as the game was original published in English.
 I guess we need Holmes to solve the case of the Puzzled Publisher.

I so wanted to like this game but it just isn't that great. The solutions to the cases are really weird sometimes and can't be solved with logical deduction (it's not like you can exclude all options to come to the correct solutions). I am looking forward to the new edition but the old one didn't hold up to it's hype.

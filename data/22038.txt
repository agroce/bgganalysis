Nice board and bits.  Game play is way to long for what fun there seems to be in this game.  Glad I didn't buy it as it took two experienced gamers 75 minutes to go through all the rules and then we spent over an hour looking things up.  A pretty game, but very stale play.

This is a title I really want to like. It's not bad, but it's not great either. It drags... tough to be aggressive in this one, yet aggressive is necessary. The game appears to get in it's own way somehow.

More experience with this might change my views though.

Very strong title with an interesting card mechanic for turn activation and resolution.  A little more effort on the balance of the mechanic and it would move from "interesting" to "elegant"- could reasonably see an expansion based simply on the cards.

There's a lot of stuff going on in this game. While this gives you options, there's a lot of book-keeping too. Has an interesting card-based randomiser, which is also used in combat. The theme is there and has nice components, but there's a ton of them, extending game set-up. Game duration is lengthy and that's why it does not hit the table as often.

After the first game I'm still waiting  the second one... The game seemed to be too short, everything is over just when it gets interesting. The game is a bit like TI3 in medieval times and the board is beautiful and components are nicely made. I still like this one, but I haven't made my mind about it for final...

RATING: 4
This game is fun to play for the first few times, and it has a lot of potential, in many differnet aspects. That's its doom: it does hardly anything right. It's too short to make a comeback: if you start slow, you're done. You could easily bolster its length with house rules, but even in its vanilla form you'll often play in the excess of 3 hours. 
Most of the games we played ended up with two obvious contenders for the top spot after around half of the playtime, and the second one winning in the last turn because someone who had no chance to win the game decided to oppose the first guy; you can't even say you earned your victory.
Components are pretty bad, the plastic figures were shipped damaged, some of their stands looked like they were bent while the figure was hardening.
If it was only for this, i'd give it a 5, but then there's the price.
I believe it deserves its fame because it's a classic, but nowadays you can find much better things for the same price or lower.

RATING: 8
A very good game that requires a lot of strategic and tactical thinking. The rules might seem overwhelming at first, but when playing it simply boils down to doing something very simple each turn, then when different situations arise, the rulebook can be consulted if needed. WK is a very fun game, with no downtime. It involves maneuvering armies around, political negotiations, economic thinking etc. I definitely recommend it. My rating is based playing the game with the expansion.

Buena mezcla de guerra y diplomacia con sabor medieval.
Componentes impresionantes (como es normal en los juegos de FFG) y una experiencia temática muy buena. Tiene una duración de juego más corta y unas reglas considerablemente más sencillas que Twilight Imperium III, y muchas más opciones que Juego de Tronos, aunque le falta esa sensación de juego de civilizaciones que tienen otros como Conquest of The Empire.
Este juego está más orientado a la guerra, aunque aún así tienes diferentes caminos para la victoria: ya sea sin atacar directamente a otros jugadores (conquistando ciudades neutrales y defendiéndolas mientras despliegas tus habilidades diplomáticas) o haciendo alianzas y yendo a la guerra. Y mientras tanto tendrás un montón de cosas que hacer (tendrás que preocuparte de la política, la iglesia, mercenarios, ciudades rebeldes, o expediciones al extranjero).
--------------------------------------------------
Good mix of war and diplomacy with medieval flavour.
Fancy bits (as usual on FFG) for a great thematic experience. It has a shorter playing time and considerably easier rules than TI3, and a lot of more options than AGOT, though it lacks the civilization feeling of other games like CoTE.
This one is more focused on war, but you still have different paths to victory: either without directly attacking other players (conquering neutral cities and then defending them while using your doplomatic skills) or making alliances and going to war. And in the meantime you have a lot of things to do (you have to deal with politics, the church, mercenaries, rebel cities, or overseas expeditions).

 Juego para seis jugadores. Tiene muchas variantes y combina lo militar con el mercadeo y el faroleo. Probado una única vez un turno a seis. El juego promete si jugamos otra partida.
Tras jugar la segunda partida he de decir que me parece un juego demasiado complejo para el desarrollo que da (escasamente 10 turnos). Te requiere aprender muchas reglas y normas que no terminan muchas veces de ser necesarias (desde los descendientes de los nobles hasta las expediciones al exterior o las colonias de ultramar). Todo eso hace que uno se sienta frustrado tras cuatro horas de partida porque las cosas no dan para más.

I want to like this game a lot, but I can't.

There are too many sideshows, the card distribution (Fate cards) is poorly thought out, and the effects of the green, red, and blue Religious cards is wildly off-balance.

I'll still play the game (there doesn't seem to be a better -- or comparable -- title in the market), but I hope the expansion fixes some of the most egregious problems in the game.

I really really want to like this game, but it does have some flaws.  I like games with lots of violence and combat.  

The basic game of Warrior knights is in my humble opinion dull, short and pointless. You will quite probably get ZERO combat between players if you play the basic game to the rules.

Get the crown of glory expansion, AND add extra rules, we find it essential to play with the more combat orientated crown of glory expansion rules, AND start with 25 Gold each instead of 15 AND increase the amount of influence per player to at least 15 or more.

There is a really good game in here trying to get out, but it somehow seems to just not quite work as well as it should.

Of course it could be poor players....

Acquired 7/24/06

Finally played 3/24/07. Loved it! I thought the game had some great mechanics and was fairly well balanced. While it took over an hour to go through the rules, once we started playing the game moved along quickly with little down time between turns. The actual game play was not nearly as complex as we thought it would be. There were some nasty negative events - like the kill a noble card. Fortunately, the timing of the negative events didn't have a huge effect on our game but that might not be the case next time. I had been plodding along capturing cities, feeling like I was in the game but definitely not winning. Isaac was amasssing huge armies and was poised to begin a classic crushing when Jared gave me a card that compelled the recipient to purchase 1 victory point per round or pass the card. At the time, my position seemed benign (he could have given the card to anyone) but taxation happened twice afterwards and I received enough money from the cities I held to use the card for 2 rounds. In the end, Isaac's offensive would have won him the game but I won instead... by a single victory point.

RATING: 5
This seemed like a game I would like, but I was really disappointed.  The game felt overwhelmed with mechanics, process, and subsystems that complicated the game without adding much to it.  The game is long and involved and too large of a percentage of it was just not compelling.

On the surface the game offers promising subsystems like sending an army overseas to conquer a wealthy city, funding a trading expedition, or having an occasional council to vote on special laws that will affect the game.  In practice, these felt like a waste of time.

The game wasn't long enough (and it's already pretty long) to allow all but the most well planned overseas mission to pay off in time.  The trading expeditions had the same problem, except that you had a good chance of losing your ships at sea.  And most of the council resolutions didn't make any difference -- by the end of the game we felt just like skipping it all.

Underneath all that you had the most successful part of the game.  Moving armies around and taking neutral cities or attacking each other.  But even as I think of it now, it wasn't that great.  You try to get big armies and take people off guard.

A Game Of Thrones and Shogun are far better multi-player war games.  Stick with those.

This has potential, but it seemed to DRAAAAAG.  Also, it seems like you're never going to get too far ahead of anyone else in anything.  You could go for the papacy, but you have to lose your tokens to gain anything.  You can go for pull at the assembly, but you have to lose your tokens to affect anything.  Pretty much all over the game is things you have to sacrifice.  Where do you actually get ahead?  Who knows.

I'd give it another try, but for now it's not a big favorite o' mine.

RATING: 10
The right mix of luck, diplomacy and war. Time just slips by when playing this as once you have allocated action cards each round the game zips along at a comfortable pace with plenty to think about.

The action card mechanic in this game is just incredible. It allows for interesting timing of events and some amazing backstabs. I wish more games utilised this mechanic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Probably one of the best strategy game I've ever played. Not only the components are great (the map is beautiful), but also the mechanics behind it are keen and effective. During the first plays it might look "difficult" to understand because there are a lot of things going, but once you'll get the rules, it's really fun. Love the actions phase and the interactions between players. Of course it's not flawless, I have the feeling that the position players take at the beginning of the game can influence a lot the whole session. Recommended!

I'd like to play this more. The main problem is that it is a very cluttered game, so it's a pain to teach. Maybe there's a way to just start playing...

One thing that does help is having a different person shuffle each stack at the same time. And then have one person go through them and tell people what to do. Keeps the pace up.

A 5 is pretty harsh I know.  But this is a multiplayer wargame and I just don't like them.  These kinds of games I find inherently flawed because of ganging up; direct effect of losing people to others.  To sum it up, these kinds of games are very susceptible to "King Making."  This one is especially worse because there is no player elimination that lets you do something else if you are losing.

The game is a little outdated (with lots of redundancy in the many decks of cards), it has kingmaking problems and the huge amount of rules makes it a tough beast to explain and digest.
Nevertheless, the action sequence mechanic is quite interesting and the game is surprisingly engaging and enjoyable even while very long.
The multiple facets open different strategic approaches, and the multitude of laws to vote in the assembly make every play a diverse experience.
If it had a shorter playtime, I'd rate it higher and I'd play more often for sure!

Played once with 4 players.  Warrior Knights is a very random wargame with little actual war.  I was expecting more confrontation between Barons.  Instead it was more of a race between players to conquer the tiny neutral cities on the mainland.  My initial setup didn't help for I was basically out of the game very early due to several random elements that would have had less of an impact if I had not started 3 of my nobles on the same starting location.

This doesn't play as fluid as 'Twilight Imperium' or 'A Game of Thrones', which, in my book, are better choices for deep strategy games. You often find yourself unable to react or even act in an adequate way. The card driven mechanisms are a nice diversion but ultimately fiddly to handle.

Played a 5 player game of this Sunday night and finished Monday night. Total time was about 4 and a half hours. Very fun game with some nice components. The game feels like a collection of microgames combined to a larger game. There is the expedition board (great way to get money), the Assembly agendas, the Special Actions track (which the players trigger themselves after playing cards). The main shining gem for me in the game was how such a long game manages potential AP issues. It does this by randomly giving out the player actions along with some Neutral actions. The Event deck is another neat little game. The Head of the Church (whoever has the most Faith, one of the resources you can get) can pay a Faith to take the Event if it's good or pay a Faith to have another played handle it if it's bad. They are color coded on the back to signify good, bad or neutral events. The Battle system left a lot to be desires however, which would probably be my one major point against the game. It was very weirdly done and extremely random. Essentially, you draw a card from the Fate deck (lots of little stacks of cards in this game) for every 100 Troops you have in the battle. Fate cards will kill 100 Troops, save 100 Troops, let you redraw or give you a Victory. Once Troop deaths are done, whomever played the most Victories (if both are still alive) wins. The whole thing just bogged down the game and was really swingy. Your Noble could die very easily with a bad card draw. So, good game but not great. Our next play through will be with the expansion, which is supposed to make the game MUCH better. Time will tell...

We started playing this over a Feb 2011 weekend and got interrupted.  It looks rather intriguing; the play is kind of a cross between Twilight Imperium and Risk; For the TI portion, you use cards to select the actions you're going to take, and the Risk Portion is area-control.  Nice components and I think it would be pretty neat with a group of adults.  My 7yr old wasn't sitting very still while we tried to learn it. :-)

Great overall game.  Combat, politics, diplomacy, and a nice mechanism for determining orders.  Main problem is that if you play with the default rules, the game ends before it has a chance to begin.  I think this is a great game if you can play with a group that is willing to accept the fact that this was meant to be a long game and throw in a bunch of extra influence into the influence pool to allow the game to go longer.

After my first play I was left marvelling at both the intricate game system that combines politics, religion, exploration, war and diplomacy, and the severe anticlimax that was the game's end, where I suddenly found I had won with barely a sword raised in anger. People say you can just play to more victory points, but would you seriously want to make the game [i]longer[/i]? After a second play (with the expansion) I've decided that, though I like many of the game's mechanics, I think there's just too much unconnected stuff going on to make the game a compelling experience. Where are the awesome boardgaming moments that stick in the memory? Buried under a pile of faith tokens, mercenary cards and far-Eastern investment opportunities, basically.

A popular board game at my club. What seems to be the biggest seller for WK is the speed of the game once you know the rules. We can crank through an entire turn very quickly due to the clever card system, and it's cool how you shuffle the order in which they come out. This too is popular with the club players. No guarantees and dealing with wierd timing of player actions, making the most of things as they arise.

The political system is one of the most well-respected out there. There are many BGG'ers who are posting variants to a few games, such as Twilight Imperium 3, using the WK political system.

The prestige points pool almost assures that games will be over after 4 three-round turns.  And with each turn about 45 minutes long, that's still a bit of pull. Players could add more prestige points to extend the game, but that just eats time without making the game really any better, IMO. Better would have been to allow players to start with one army in a foreign land (at the point where they may assault or lay seige the chosen city) and one city on the table already under their influence. Were I a part of the design team, I would have collapsed the whole Assembly element into a card that players may play into the turn sequence that will allow them a pull at an Assembly deck. Still, holding and negotiating in Assemblies is a great bit of the thematic fun of the game and therefore difficult to imagine the game without it.

This happens to be my favorite board game. I love how political it is with the other players. I usally mod the rules just a bit to give influence to the chairman and church, and to make it even more political.

Looks like a pretty good game, it's on its way to me now.  I've read the rules and they appear to be a mis-mash of mechanics and a whole lot of fiddling around with cards and tokens.... I'm not really seeing the fun factor and I'm not even inspired to drop this on the table and try to figure it out.  As my collection grows I'm finding less time is used on experimentation with games.  At any rate, I hope to figure this game out one day but I don't foresee that day being soon.

RATING: 7.5
This game is reminiscent of King-maker, Game of Thrones and Wallenstein. While in essence a straightforward "king of the hill" type game, it has many, many bits of chrome around the chassis. There is a lot going on in this game but the flow is reasonably smooth after an initial period of adjustment to the way player actions are regulated. There are elements of empire expansion and management, with diplomacy, economics and medieval warfare mixed in.

Things develop slowly but, depending on the seeding of the influence pot, it can end abruptly. It can be a longish game with more than four players. Although the elements mesh together well, it has a definite "kitchen sink-ish" feel to it. One thing I give it is a "thumbs up" for is the use of cards to resolve combat - so much better than the Battle Cards of WtP or Hannibal.

Like the nobles who populate the game, Warrior Knights seems to suffer from too much inbreeding.  There is too much Euro nonsense and procedure bogging down the game. In a six player game, there are 42 actions in a single game round with the possibility of three more lengthy special phases!  Despite all this, there is little player versus player action and almost no tension.  I do like the card-based battle mechanics.  Too bad they are mostly used to combat neutral cities.  It is one of those games where you simply try to keep pace with everyone until the last turn and hope to have the last actions (actions order is random).  This game also gets the award for most extraneous sideshow mechanic ever - betting on expeditions.

It's tough to grasp at first, but once you do understand everything that is going on the game becomes a real gem.

I've only been able to play with 3 people so I'm really looking forward to playing with more. I imagine the game will shine even more with more players.

UPDATE: YOu know, I really, really want to like this game. I've given it 5 chances, but every time we play the game is spoiled by unclear rules that elad to bickering amongst the players and a bad experience for all involved. There's just a lot of rules weight that gets in the way of enjoying the game... much like Arkham horror.

Good theme and many enjoyable mechanics to the game. Our group's problem is that the game is over so quickly, we don't get a chance to 'play' many of the mechanics. We've decided next time we play this to use some house rules to hopefully give us more rounds in a game; if we can strike a good balance I may bump this to an 8 as there is lots to like about this one.

Update: Played many times and couldn't find a good mix of house rules to make it more enjoyable. Find some of the mechanics ill-fitting together. Bumped down to a 6.

The verdict is out. A little lengthy to teach (90 minutes!) then 3 hours to play. There seems to be better games for this type of genre (Small World, Bushido etc).

There really is not much conflict or war. It's a  race to grab neutral cities and then hold on to them to score VPs from round to round. Lots of randomness from the card draws. However, it has some innovative mechanisms, especially with the actions.

Great epic AT styled wargame. Has gone over very well with my gaming friends that like  direct-conflict, screw your neighbor type of game. Only real downside is that unless you play the "epic" length version, the game is only starting to get interesting by the time the VP pool has run out. Now when we play we allocate six hours or else pick something that plays shorter.

RATING: 3
This is a classic attempt to take an old-school wargame and meld it with euro-like mechanics which gravely misfires.

If you want to improve a game, the idea is not to just throw in some abstract euro-like mechanics that work elsewhere, but to worry about things like complexity, pacing, tension, and so on. Warrior Knights is killed by the pacing problem. Too little happens in too much time. You spend more time fiddling the mechanics of the game and maintaining state than you do making interesting decisions. Things proceed at a pace that can only be called glacial.

Plus, it should be noted that this game is just Diplomacy with a huge amount of overhead. This is a game about alliances and deal-making far more than about tactics or strategy. But the game doesn't give you enough to make the deal-making interesting, really - the agenda voting is too hit-and-miss, and you can't really trade resources. And the positions are not asymmetrical enough for there to be interesting diplomacy.

I never played the original, but the new version is pretty much a failure. Warrior Knights was clearly inspired by Avalon Hill's classic Kingmaker, but Kingmaker is the superior game. And when I can say that, that's not good.

Warrior Knights fails my new test for eurogame quality: is it as good as Risk or Monopoly? The answer here is clearly a resounding no.

RATING: 6
This game is a fun political game.  Don't be misled by the warrior in the title, cause combat really doesn't play out much.  Someone has to make a decision to be hyperaggressive from the start for this to actually play out like a wargame.  Otherwise, you get armies just big enough to take cities, and spend most of the game in assembly, voting on issues.

I'm sure there's a good game in there, but this one is so painfully slow moving and long that whatever goodness there was to the game was overshadowed by the boredom of it all.  There seems to be quite a conundrum here.  We played a short game (reduced the influence), and the game didn't take enough turns to be all that interesting.  However, to play a longer game would, well, take longer, and I'd never want to play this game for that long!  Overall, I have no desire to ever play this stinker again.

I highly recommend this game for fans of Wallenstien and other Euro-wargames.  I really enjoy the pre-programmed actions that are shuffled with event cards.  The gambling expeditions are vying for the gavel and scepter are also a lot of fun.  The combat is well done, especially in how the fate cards are implemented with the nobles and armies.  Boy, paying for the mercanies can be an economic struggle at times.  I only wish there was a way to move a noble without exhausting him, a Forced March card or something.  All in all, a very enjoyable game to play and I can see my rating go up with subsequent plays.

I got this game not too long ago as I was very impressed with the original 1985 game.

However, this game has been radically redesigned--it seems the designers wished to add  Euro style constraints to the game, which unfortunately do not work too well given that the original game is most definitely not a Euro.

It is OK to play, but just when the action gets going, the game is over.  I heard that the expansion addressed some of these questions, but too late.  Sorry.

I bought this due to remembering loving the old version (that and it was £10). Played once, it was decent and I enjoyed the game. The trouble is that I own at least ten better multiplayer wargames so it won't get played again. This game has the classic problem of fighting being so disadvantageous to those involved that you are better off turtling and never attacking. It was also a long, slow game. The voting part was cool though it exists in other similar games. 

I've lost one card from the game so I feel bad selling or trading it until I find the card again. I found it a while back but I didn't know which game it was from so I put it somewhere "safe".

Fun to play with a group of people that is dedicated to do everything as well as possible and can focus on the game for quite some time.
Involves both military actions and political actions.
Control of cities is what gets you influence points and the most influence at the end of the game wins unless you control at least half of all the cities on the map at the end of a round which gives you a instant win.

Played once with 6 players. Its possible the game would be more compelling and less painful with 4 players....but some of the basic elements would not change, so I doubt my rating would move significantly.

I actually kind of like the game engine of choosing card actions and seeding the 3 decks. But the actions themselves are fairly limited. For most of the game, I felt like the game was playing me.

Overall, it moved too slowly, there were not enough ways to get VPs, or at least to separate from the pack....the special missions were fairly chaotic. 

If I'm going to play a long fiddly game like this, I want more excitement, more theme, or more meaningful decisions.  At least one of the above.

Total 'chrome' but a neat game and great theme. Problem is the gameplay is very fiddly and there's not much action happening or scope for strategy.

Everything a solidly designed, modern hybrid Euro/American board game ought to be- thematically rich without needless abstraction, rules that are easy without sacrificing depth, and clean mechanics that don't get in the way of creative thinking and player interaction.  Warrior Knights is a real knockout, a tremendously exciting and fun medium-weight, multiplayer wargame that manages to capture the wild thrill of baroque, 1980s style gaming in a relatively short playtime that's sure to be full of blackhearted treachery, shocking shifts in alliance, and revelations of noble sterility.  There's at least 179 mechanics happening in a game of WK, and they all work pretty darn well together.  In particular, I found the combat system quite ingenious- yes, it's full of wonderful, blissful chaos but it also allows for some pretty exciting results including tremendous upsets, Pyrric victories, and complete massacres.   The subsystems, such as the trade routes and the Assembly phase, add lots of flavour and scope without complicating the game too much and contrary to what a bunch of folks have already said I think the level of luck is exactly right for this sort of game.  Indeed, if you dig Talisman as much as you dig A Game of Thrones, this should be your next purchase.  I think this is ultimately a better game than AGoT and along with the masterful reissue of Fury of Dracula it proves that all the games that everybody gave up rushing to play Elfenland back in 1995 should never have gone away.  Why play Caylus and try to impress King Dinkydonkey by building a church when you can run roughshod over a fictional European country with raging barons full of hate and bloodlust with names like Geoffery Lavender and Sir John Dudley Black?   Very close to a 10 indeed...it does work with 2, by the way, but be prepared to sort of fudge it a little on some of the Assembly cards.  I think the only thing that keeps it from a 10 for me is that I'm not entirely satisfied with the way the influence points work- every game I've played has ended with everyone agreeing to add more influence and just keep going.  I think it's a really artifical, superfluous way to shorten the play time that winds up ending the game at what seems like the beginning of the last third.   Regardless, it's easy enough to fix by adding more influence or by only using the "half the unrazed cities on the board" condition so bollocks to anyone who sees that as a game-breaker.

Pretty typical fantasy flight game, heavy on theme with great components. The difference with this one is there wasn't any dice despite this game having a combat element.

The game is a combination of area control and hand management, and the combat mechanism is implemented through random card draws. 

I put this on a similar level to Conquest of Nerath. It is worth playing, however it is fairly long for what it is, and while there is some depth there, this length of game should be more rewarding than it is.

June 22nd, 2008 -- I played this yesterday with a full six players, and while the game isn't bad, I think it's missing that crucial element of fun. The game is a little too long for what it offers, and there's little reason to go to war with your neighbours. More player interaction is necessary. I'm also not really keen on the way battles work. Hand management for battles? It's a little dull. 6/10

Again, I've only played a couple of times (yeah, I suck at logging my plays), but this one seems like a real winner. Beautiful components, rich theme, engaging gameplay, accessible rules, diplomacy, backstabbing... how much more fun could you ask for? And this game's chrome has definitely piqued the interest of more than one non-gamer. The rule book could be laid out better, however... and the sheer amount of rules and bookkeeping can be intimidating to the above-referenced non-gamers.

I enjoy the random card draw for actions in the turn. I would like the "special" phases to be resolved differently. They seem to break game continuity. As always, even with a reading of the rule hours before start time, the three of had to refer to the rules constantly. I enjoyed the game and will play when asked. 10 Influence Points per player seems to end the game too soon, I urge you to use at least 12 Influence Points per player, 15 would be better.

This game ends abruptly, just as it's starting to get fun. Even playing with additional influence in the pool only extends the game by 1 or 2 turns at most, which is still too early. It's possible that we are not playing aggressively enough, but it feels like FF tried to make this game into "Twilight Imperium Lite", whereas it would probably be better served with a game length on the order of TI3.

Not sure yet how this one will work out. It has a ton of elements that *should* be fun, but so far it's been iffy. It's definitely a fiddly game--managing all those little cards and chits becomes tiresome. I need to invent a mini-card shuffler that can handle three stacks at a time.

The production values for this game are excellent, my only minor complaint being that the soft plastic minis get bent out of shape rather too easily.

[b]Update(1):[/b] This game takes some time to appreciate. It's really balanced on a knife-edge and the tightness of the design is not apparent the first couple of plays. I also think it needs 5 or 6 players to really shine.  I still think the expeditions track is surplus to requirements, but it doesn't detract from the experience.  Must be played with Crown & Glory expansion

[b]Update(2):[/b] Have decided to trade this game away after playing [i]A Game of Thrones[/i].  AGoT has better pacing, better combat resolution and a more intense meta-game.

Wow, I want to play 5 more times.  A bit of a headache for the first hour but the mechanics are great. So many different interesting things occuring, that it almost marginalizes the map fighting.  Great game so far. 5 players is long-beware! I've heard 3 is much quicker.

Can I acknowledge the brillance of this game and at the same time acknowledge that it is so fiddly, long, and cumbersome that I'm not going to suggest it often.  There are some very nifty mechanics but the inability to really ramp up your VP engine is pretty frustrating.  The large board and slow movement is also a pain, Everything needs to speed up in this game. Oh and I love the exploration track, its just fun!

Looks like another FFG winner! The rules seem easy to grasp, and the components are first rate, as we have come to expect from FFG. I will rate upon a play or two.

Update: After two plays, this is a real winner! The flow of the game is smooth, and in general, it's an easier game to get into than Twilight Imperium 3rd edition, while still dripping with theme. Playing with 3 people the first time, 5 the second, both plays were equally fun!

Lots of interaction with the players in a game that just gets better the longer the game lasts. Players are rarely out of contention until the last turn. Fast, well-thought out combat system.

Rules are easy but there are a TON to go over. The game is interactive at all points and with the right group a lot happens in a relatively short period of time.

A 9 only because the game always feels like it ends too soon no matter how long we go.

RATING: 2
Dear god, awful. The game feels like a bunch of eurotrash mechanics bolted onto an ameritrash game. The game has excessively long playing time for what it is, owing in part to the constant stoppage required for combat card drawing, the assembly, and the card/action selection mechanics in general.

The gameplay itself is a yawner, as you move around your nobles and capture castles, mostly moving and attacking one area per turn. There's not much in the way of tactical maneuvering, and trying to capture the overseas areas will require several rounds.

To top it all off, the rulebook is absolutely horrid. To wit, there appears to be a lot of debate about just how exactly the assembly rules work. When the fan-submitted player aids start getting bloated, that's when you know there are serious issues.

What a fun game, if you don't mind spending around 3 hours (I think if everyone has played before and plays quickly, you can do it in around 2 or 2 1/2 hours), yet the time goes by pretty quickly.  The balance of luck/chaos and strategy/control seems just about right, there are a number of clever self-balancing mechanisms, the turns move along quickly (the slowest part is when everyone plans their action cards for the turn, but as the turns are played out, things move along pretty quickly.  The other thing that can take time is the voting when there is negotiation going on, but they don't occur that often, and usually are fairly quick).  Really, one of the best games of its type.

Players are barons, sending nobles romping around the board to conquer cities and gain influence (victory points).  Enjoyable, old fashioned conquest game where players get to beat up on other players, make and break pacts, and generally get medieval.  Mechanics have been upgraded to the "Euro" world, where players select six actions each from a deck of twelve, and feed them into different decks.  The decks are run through, with players taking their actions as they are revealed.  You can go for money, political / religious power, or military might - each of which will eventually trigger major events like taxation or parliament.  At the end of each turn each player earns points for cities held, which paints big targets on leaders, and off we go again.  Each action is quickly resolved, combat is quick and clean, and everybody stays interested.  Kukos to the developers for creating a conquest game with almost no downtime.  Good fun.

The mechanics are great. I love the stupid names of the nobles.
After having played it more often, I had to promote it from "8" to "9". As the mechanics become more intuitive, it really shines. I must admit, a great game group (like mine) is mandatory. You don´t want to play this with people who complain about backstabbing and whine about bad decissions they made hours ago.

Players take on the role of barons vying against each other.  You will have to both manage your income as well as recruit and lead an army in combat against the other players.

RATING: 7
rating based on one 3-player game. Great game, but by the time battle was about to start taking place between players, the game was over because all the influence tokens were taken. Instead of starting the game with 10 influence tokens per player, I think around 15 would be better. Plan on a 4-5 hour game with 15 tokens.

Really enjoy this game, especially the central mechanic of the action cards.  However the base game lacks a certain something (mostly a drive towards conflict) and I would advise playing with the Crown & Glory expansion which really takes this to a whole new level of fun and awesomeness.

RATING: 7
Interesting War/Political game that has several nifty mechanics.  The combat system, assemblies and army building phases all shine.  The only downside is the length of the game, which should improve with further plays.   This one has the potential to move up as we explore it further.  A word of caution, do not start out in the middle of the board.

With so many great mechanics I couldn't see this game going wrong.  However, I'm no fan of wargames, and should have thought about that before giving this a try.  It took forever, and I really didn't enjoy all those great mechanics shoved into one game.

Equal parts politics and warfare.  You can win with either approach, or a blend.  I also like how easy it is to scale the length of the game, and I have to say that the longer the better for this one.

RATING: 7
Well designed and interesting game. Excellent presentation. I might have rated it higher except for 2 things... 

1) It feels like there is a bit too much luck and chaos involved in the cards for such a long and deep strategy game. No amount of strategizing and careful planning will help you if you draw the wrong cards, or if your opponent draws the right ones. I don't normally mind this degree of chaos in a game, but given the complexity and length it just feels a little "off" to me. It will take more plays to find out. 

2) Another minor gripe is that the end game seems anti-climatic. The influence pool runs out, and the turn plays out, and the game just ends.

But neither of these problems are terribly serious, and there are dozens of things I like about the game. There is certainly a lot of depth here, and multiple paths to victory. I would gladly revisit the game in the future.

RATING: 8
I have never played the original. Based on 8-9 4 player games. It plays very well with that number and after getting used to the action (which speeds up the planning phase a lot) and combat mechanics, we clock at 3.5-4 hours which is very good for that kind of game. And we are a slow group by most standards. This is also based on 15 influence per player. At least with 4 players, I can't see us playing with less than that, otherwise the game ends too early. The fate deck mechanic is really good in that it brings "predictable" randomness to the game, especially combat. The rulebook is also very clear and well written with very few gray areas. All in all, great stuff.

Now I know why I played this excellent game about 60 times back in the 80's. Loved it then and the new FFG version is better in every way. Top notch production, everything exudes quality. Nice smooth play... smoother than the old version. Any complaints about the game ending when things get heated are easily dealt with by the suggestion in the rules to simply add extra influence to the pool. Duh. 

Figure about 30-45 minutes per player. Frankly, the flow is smooth and quick and only those stricken with terminal indecisiveness will bog this down. This is not a game to fret every move, this is a game to be aggressive and wreak havoc on your opponents. The gentle souls who sip their wine and contemplate the next move in Yinsh or the next friendly auction in Princes of Florence need to stay away from this game. This isn't a Euro, it isn't friendly and it isn't "elegant"... it's rough and tumble and it's just spectacular to look at and play. Tip of the hat to FFG and the redesign team.

The more I play this, the more I realize what a near-perfect game it is.  Strategy on so many parallel levels, never enough time to do everything you want, TONS of diplomacy and negotiation, and plenty of luck, that can generally be minimized with forethought (keeping faith tokens handy, having enough $$$, etc).  Not to mention how innovative and elegant the expeditions, the staggered action card selection, and the special phase implementation are.  I could play this game every day.

An older game I got at a ridiculous price (many people seem to be getting rid of it). The rulebook looks long and chaotic, but once you actually try to set up a test game by yourself and try to learn the game, you just realize that the rulebook cut be cut down to half. As for the game itself, I found it simply great: lots of stuff going on and you are always invested in what happens at all times, even if because you don't know when your actions to resolve might be drawn. The minigames that activate according to previous phases of the game are genius. I find this game severely underrated. Another Konieczka gem from the 00's.

From reading the description I thought this game would be right up my alley.  After having played it a few times I think it's decent but there are a number of things I don't like about the game such as the card driven combat.  Normally I love card driven combat but that's typically when players get to pick the cards from their own card pool.  In this game both players pick up cards from a common deck to find out the results which means it's more akin to rolling a 50 side dice a few times.  The design also left something to be desired such as:  It would have been nice to have a counter to accompany your barons on the board which would indicate how large the army of your opponents are without having to ask them since they're across the table.  There was another design flaw but I can't recall it right now.

There is a lot going on here. For me the game felt as if it exsisted to help players in a RPG visualize where their armies are in some fantasy world. Don't get me wrong, there is a game here... but it is just too much work to hack through if you looking for an Ameritrash experiance.

Having just recently gotten back into this extraordinary game and managing to come up with a (nearly finalized) solitaire variant which is proving to be fairly easy to utilize and quite satisfying, this game now truly rocks for me as a primarily solitaire player.

May be the very best game of its type -- wonderfully thematic, and rich with tactical/strategic options, multiple interacting factors, and meaningful choices every turn.  Great fun and marvelously immersive in its storytelling power.

I view Warrior Knights is a great game made even better with the expansion, which I think is a must, even for the first game.  I admit though that Warrior Knights is not for everybody.

The rules are daunting, fiddly and quite confusing, and there is a lot to keep track of in this game.  It took a couple of games before things really started to make sense.  The "special phases" mechanic is quite innovative and adds an important element to the strategy.  10 victory points per player should only be used for learning purposes as it triggers the end just as things are getting rolling.  Use 15 or even 20 if you are playing with four players or less, but be aware that this will then take 4 and maybe even 6 hours to complete.

Warrior Knights seems to have a pretty steep learning curve which, coupled with the play time, makes finding interested players the hardest part of this game.

One four player game.

What struck me almost immediately about this game was that it was trying so hard to be like Twilight Imperium 3. No, the mechanics really aren't all the same, but it gets really fiddly with a bunch of stacks of cards and too many paths that get diluted, and where even if you try to concentrate on one, the game's over before you get really good at it. I've seen comments about how the game is played with 10 VPs per person, and we seemed to have more than that (everyone finished between 12-16) but we still just got to the point where we were attacking each other in the last round. 

The placement of cards in a rough order of drawing works much better in Wallenstein.

I really have no interest to play this again, although chances are I'll be talked into it once or twice more. There just seem to be too many nagging points about it that want me to avoid it (same with TI3).

I'm sure FF will put out an expansion (or dozen) to prolong the agony - I just hope I'll never have to participate in it. Why remakes need to be made of *every* game that has a cult following is beyond me. 

[b]Play #2 (incomplete game)[/b] Still nothing really grabbed at me. It just seemed like there was a lot of buildup which is the majority of the game, and the mid-end game areas are much smaller. Seems like assaults on cities are pointless and that sieges are the only way to go. I don't know... three hours on buildup puts this game on the lines of Civilization, and that's a place I just don't want to go.

Since I did fall behind early on (due to unsuccessful assaults on the cities) I didn't really see a way to catch up. More plays may find solutions to this, but that ain't happening.

This game gets better the more I play it.  At first the rules seemed confusing and overwhelming.  But now, there is still some occasional rule clarification that comes up, but not often.  The game is a very enjoyable experience.  I love the wargame aspects and the political aspects.  My wife loves playing this game too.  The only downside is that it can take a long time to play.  I have tried the variation where you use less Influence Points per player but the game seems to be over just when it gets interesting.

Great game.

Follow-up.  Once we started playing this game we got to the point where we actually wanted it to last longer.  We  started adding more Influence Points to ensure the game gets more room to breathe.

I wrote up a review of this game and it has been well received here on the Geek.  I even got a note from the designer of the original version of the game, complimenting me on the review.

Dropped the game rating down to an 8 in December 2013.  As newer games come into my collection and as my time permits, I'm finding my tastes change a bit.

This is not your normal strategy/war game.  This felt a lot like you were really vying for power among many nobles who were both trying to run and rule a kingdom together.  In other words, this game is not just about the fighting.  You also have to work through laws, taxes, expeditions, voting, troop management, influence, and revolts.  It's a very immersive and fun experience.

Warrior Knights is, at its heart, a pretty standard "conquer the world" game. The knight who controls most cities in the kingdom wins and becomes the next king. This basic premise is spiced up with several interesting diversions and mechanics, though, the most important of which are politics and the action system.

At irregular intervals the council convenes to debate various issues, from laws to personal favours. These can have significant impact on the game so the council is more than just an unimportant side track.

With regard to actions, each knight has the same set of cards from which he can choose several to play during a turn. While he can decide which of his actions should happen early or late in the round the exact order (and whether the opponents will be able to act before or after) is unknown. This allows for quite a bit of tactical maneuvering. When a certain amount of cards has been played, this triggers extra actions such as a council convention or the hiring of new soldiers.

Overall a game with interesting mechanics (and a rulebook written for dimwits), but maybe a tad long.

This game appealed after the first outing, leaving me with things to think about and strategies to explore.  However, upon playing again the stratagies aren't many, the randomness really injures the playability to a point where it feels there is no control over battles.  the game is too long for what is going on.  there are many elements that squeeze into the game but none that feel offer any real decisions.  I will play at least one more time to see if it remains this way, but the steep drop in enjoyment seems more accurate than just a bad outing.

[b][i]Warrior Knights[/i][/b] is full of great ideas. Orders are chosen secretly by each player using order cards. Using cards to declare orders is not unique to WK by any stretch, but it is uncommon to then have the cards resolve in a semi-random order. This makes planning interesting and difficult, and it makes order resolution fun. Further, to then have the order cards placed under a track that will trigger different game events is great in that it's a clever way of making/influencing game events and it keeps you from using that order again until the event resolves (adding extra strategy to playing orders). The card-based armies that are part of a general's forces is something I would like to see in more games. The church and political roles are fun. Expeditions are interesting.

Warrior Knights has so much going on that (and now we're approaching the negative) the first several games are slow. I don't mind long, but I get concerned when a game feels slow. Fortunately, gameplay considerably speeds up with repeated plays. The game is best with 6 and severely declines if you have fewer than 4. But if you can get 6 experienced players to play Warrior Knights, you'll have a game session to remember.

Wanted to like this but appeared to have some rules issues.  Would need to give it more plays to get a better feel for it.  Wonderful bits, with some nice appeal to the look and feel.  Laughable how few fate cards there are.  Can't believe a good company like FFGs didn't see that.  They're offering an expansion to fix that though.

There is a lot going on in this game, but I think it all comes together quite cleanly once you've layed a game to see how it all interlinks.  To me, this feels like a mix between Twilight Imperium and Samurai Swords, but it plays faster than either.  I am not familiar with the original, so I'm not sure what was changed or added, but I really enjoy this version.

Your first game will probably go fairly long (>2 hrs) as you figure out what the several different action cards do.  However, you can lower the influence pool by 2 per player to shorten it up.  However, if you do that, make an effort to initiate combat with opponents to see how it works.  (With less influence on the line, turtling becomes advantageous, but you want this to be a learning game.)  After players have tried the game once, and can play reasonably quickly, I prefer more influence in the starting pool (12 per player) to allow greater need for conflict.

Solid multiplayer FF war game. I wish there was a little bit more early aggression, seems like there is too much incentive to expand and avoid conflict and it is a bit tough to get to an opponent early enough to prevent this. Play with expansion, improves game significantly.

An excellent game of war and politics in medieval theme. It has very original mechanics, which forces players to plan their actions in advance and campaign with deliberation rather than furiously attack opponents. Battle system is also very interesting - it is based on card draw and tactical selection. You achieve victory by military control of cities, but it is impossible to win without good political and economic strategy. It is fantastic game, but it needs an expansion "Crown And Glory", which fixes some important flaws of the core game. Without this "repair kit" the game is slower and a little limited.

There are some striking similarities to Twilight Imperium, with voting and role selection. There isn’t the same epic feel and variability that TI has. However, it has its own good things. First of all, the game is over in a much smaller time frame, which make it more probable to get to the table and I think the voting works better. My rating of 7 is a modest rating and I expect it to rise to an 8 with repeated plays.

I played the game with four players and I think it worked fine with that number and I can see it play good with anywhere from 3 to 6 players. The scalability is much better than e.g. Twilight Imperium seems to have. Personally, I think 5 is the golden number.

This game is a fun mixture of negotiation, aggression, and planning.  The number of event and assembly cards assure no two games will be alike.  Exciting random but flavorful things are sure to upset the eurogramers, but this game is not really for people that only like euros.  It’s a rehash of a classic smash mouth Games Workshop game, with some new elements added to update the design.  Only complaint was that all of us felt it ended abruptly, although this ending is needed to keep the game under 3-4 hours.

Kingmaker combat system. Too many subsystems which detract from the main objective which is taking control of cities.

I find those large hexagons both rigid and too few.

What an intriguing game! Great mechanisms and a good balance of luck and planning. Seems too short though when you play with the Influence pool - game's over just when it starts to get interesting. 
Needs more play time (probably a fixed amount of rounds - 6-8 seems good).

Played it twice now - second time seemed a bit tedious with several phases of individual AP. Still too short for all the possibilities involved. Maybe too complex for its own good?

Light, nonhistorical,  multiplayer medieval wargame.  Reminds me of the excellent computer game Lords of the Realm II: the king has died without an heir, and you and the other wannabes make political, economic, and military moves to strike for the crown.  Unfortunately, the overdone mechanics lead to lots of card shuffling and other overhead, while not permitting much to happen on the gameboard.  Even the optional 15-point long game seems to end before much of interest has transpired.  My overall impression is of an hour's worth of stuff crammed into a 2-4 hour package.  Also, the substandard gameboard warps worse than any other gameboard that I've ever seen.

Tried playing this by myself.  Complicated rules regarding combat variations & effects with a number of specialized rules to remember as game runs along.  Has a very nice play mechanic with programmed cards played over three phases of each turn (and this is VERY fast playing).  Problem is that this ends up being a very long game, easily 4 hours+, that tends to focus on a slow moving tit-for-tat combat against other players as you struggle for area control.  There are a lot of things to like about this game, but the combat bogs it down and it just takes too long to complete.  Includes Crown & Glory expansion with trade.  Previous owner tossed out the insert.

Seems to fall apart, despite the great visuals and updated parts and mechanics.  Combat, while now diceless, still relies too much on luck as there's not enough sorting you can do with your hand to create strategy.  The order system works on paper, but doesn't work in reality and you can't really plan because of the randomness and the board changes that can occur before your action is played.  Finally, the church is okay, but you might as will save your faith to counter evil events and ignore it.  In the end, quite a disappointment.

RATING: 7.4
Even with expansions it is a bad 4x experience. You may only gain points by controlling cities which causes in game mechanics (voting, events and expeditions) dull and pointless. You just had to be sure to gain enough coins to pay your armies' wages and go for conquering. Because only controlled cities gain points and all other stuffs are needless to follow mostly. Secret missions which can be done bu other players without their knowledge is making them worse and battle mechanics, event cards are too much random and delivering no strategy.

It may be a ok 4x game if there are much more better examples of it like Mare Nostrum and Twilight Imperium or Eclipse. By now you may get these games instead of Warrior Knights.

Il y des cartes dans l'agenda qui sont assez rough comme j'ai perdu 2 nobles pour la game avec un agenda que j'ai perdu.  Je pense que le pool d'influence à 8 pour chaque joueurs serait assez car en majorité du temps on en gagne 2 par tour.  L'argent au début ne semblait pas important mais quand tu pognes les wages et que tu dois payer tes mercenaires tu fais plus attention. à 5 ça doit commencer à être long. je pense qu'à 3 ou 4 c'est le bon max pour ne pas passer du temps.

RATING: 5
After 1 play.

It's very hard to judge such a complex title after just 1 game (and several observations), but so far I can't tell I like it.  It has GREAT great potential, which seems to be wasted to enormous degree (many nice rules and mechanisms, but the game is too short to use/explore them all; on the other hand lengthened game would take hooours of play - and it's not short even now).

Scoring is very very troubling - it prefers safe play and no risk, just fortifying in your castles.  The one who risks might even beat the current leader, but most probably won't win the game.  Only true alliances might help to solve this problem, but it is not guaranteed.

Of course, you can make several fixes to make this game (much) better, but the gaming is not about it, is it?

Rating based upon only one play, but I did enjoy this game.  I was aware of the "ends too soon" issue, but my play group wanted to play by the rules anyway.  Well...just as others have stated, I think it would play better with a larger influence pool.  (maybe 15 per player?)  The game ended and I still needed two cities for a military victory.  I did have the most influence also, but only by about 2-3 points.  I think the game could have used as least 3-4 more rounds.  The effects of the Assembly need more game time to be meaningful (and there needs to be more assemblys).  The rest of my game group didn't seem to like it as much as I did, but I think it had something to do with being unfamiliar with the rules and the "short" game time.

It bugs me quite a bit that the combat win condition is impractical.  The game is mechanically fine.  That being said, it has been a 4-5 hour game where I wasn't in competition after an hour or two.

Read the rules, looks pretty good. Hope it differs enough from the Game of Thrones game to be interesting enough to keep in my collection. UPDATE: Got the expansion before playing the base game, because based on the reviews out there, it is the best way to experience the game.
UPDATE: After reading the rules 3 times, I still couldn't grasp the game fully. It seems there are too many mechanisms intertwining, and it just seems fiddly. I got rid of it. This game would prevent me from playing A Game of Thrones, which is a game I love and already know.

This is a neat multi-player wargame free-for-all. Has the typical limitations: long play time, you have to embrace negotiations and politics, more players is better. Solid mechanics and a wide variety of things going on. You have to have a group that wants to make a full session out of this and is capable of playing up the flavor. Reminds me of the marathon session back in high school. It's a good game, but rates as a definitive 6 for me: "will play sporadically if in the right mood."

Epic game of kingdom management and commanding. 

Suffers from stagnancy where the Taxation phase only gets set off if all barons do Levy Taxes or some put Serve the Church into taxation. The fate deck is too small and constatnly requires reshuffling.

Although the game takes very long to play, it [b]tends to end prematurely and anti-climatically[/b] where battles are on the brink of occuring but the influence points expire. Becomes an initial landgrab game and sit on your bases until you win. Not enough incentive to attack other knights, since you are extremely outnumbered in most cases.

Otherwise, the command aspect of [b]battle is simple yet extremely effective[/b]. Certainly gives combatants a taste of struggling armies in a strategist's perspective.

I've only played once and we were likely missing a few of the rules.  I really like the idea of having separate knights with separate armies marching around causing havoc.  I really like the mechanic of random turn orders and random special events happening as the results of the cards played.  I also like how the event deck foreshadows good or bad events and allows a player to pay to do something evil to someone else or good to his/herself.  What I don't like is the length of the game.  If feels like the game ends just as it is getting interesting.  If you use the rules and end the game when the victory point supply ends that will be after just 4 or 5 rounds.  That is just when the armies are getting built up and ready to start attacking other strongholds and cities.  This is an easy fix: just extend the game and I'll likely try that on the next play.  I think the design on this game is very unique and enjoyable but I do question how often we'll play it.

RATING: 5
Nation building game with strategic warfare, technology advances and a bunch of other elements, some of which feel tacked-on (especially the expeditions) and/or never amounted to much. I enjoyed it, but would choose another game of TI3 over this, and if I intended to purchase a game of this sort I would definitely look around. The theme is an abstractified 15-century mishmash that someone somewhere will think is complete bullshit. Only played with the expansion (but not the king or mission variants), which contains the essential Forced March action.

An okay area control game. The order mechanic makes the game maybe a bit too random for some people, but I don't mind. It makes the war-element more realistic in my opinion.

This game would be spot on if the planning/action cards were better, and if the game moved faster. The time constraints is definitely a draw back too, because its nearly impossible to win militarily unless every opponent city you take over is their capital. I love the barons armies though, I just wish they could move more than once, and further. Players usually spend the game grabbing all the empty cities and staying alive until they win from just collecting the most influence. The political cards are weak too sometimes.

Well, after repeated plays I realized that the game is way to slow moving and uninteresting for my taste. The player interaction is good, but other games implement this way better (Fief). I think the game has its merits for the time, but the slow progression and clunky mechanisms are just a remnant of an old time that is just obsolete these days. If you would like to dwelve in nostalgia, you might enjoy this, though. Otherwise, modern games (and some good oldies) deliver more punch in the same playtime...

Warrior Knights is... Weird. It's an "ameritrash" upon traditional "euro" mechanism. It's a game which tries to be a 4X strategy game without being a 4X. It has diplomacy, it has conflict and it has empire building. Individually, each element has seen a better implementation somewhere else. As a whole, the way they are mixed in Warrior Knights gives birth to something deep, unique and satisfying.

I must warn you: the game is long. Even longer if you add more than ten victory points per player. By the way, that's something you should do. Maybe not during a learning session, but most definitely once all players are familiar with the game. With only ten victory points per player the game ends abruptly, never reaching its apex.

Creating a pool of fifteen points per player only increases the game's length by a third or so, and its so worth it. Because its the flow of that latter third what makes the game truly shine. You spend the rest of the game preparing for it. It's when kingdoms clash. When alliances form and shatter at a stupidly fast pace.

Warrior Knights is an odd beast. At fist it feels closer to euros like Agricola than to heavy conflict based games: all its mechanisms seem to constrict the player, with most interactions being indirect. And if you keep a pool of ten points per player, it's the only thing they do. With a small pool of victory points, Warrior Knights is a particularly decaffeinated and boring euro with flashy plastic bits. 

It's when you add more points when the game breaks the mould. The less points there are in the pool, the less restricted each player is by the game's mechanisms. At first all players struggle to break the chains the game imposes on them. One by one, players will break those chains. Once broken, players will think they are unstoppable. But they are not. A couple false steps and they will find themselves to be constricted by the mechanisms again. It's the possibility of being completely wrecked what makes the game so engaging and tense. What makes it shine.

So yes, Warrior Knights is odd. But odd in different and refreshing ways.

Excellent game. Each player takes the role of a noble with desires of being proclamed the new king of the realm. The mechanics of WK are clever and elegant, and work smoothly. 

When this game shines, in my opinion, is in giving players so much options to achieve victory. In essence, you can work in three different fields: politics, religion, and militar power. Being impossible to be the strongest player in all of them, you have to prioritise. Combine this with the need to control your treasury -not having enough currency at a critical moment can completely end with your hopes of kingship- and you will find a game in wich each decision is important. And in each turn you will be making at least 9 of them.

So much I like WK, I am far from considering it perfect. It has two problems. First of all, having a complete, fulfilling game takes no less than 3 hours and a half, and usually much more. In addition, WK also have an issue with the final turn of the game. At that point, it is usual that only 2 or 3 players are in a position of achieving victory, with the rest not having any real option. This could imply some frustration or boredom for these players. Taking into account that one turn takes no less than 20 minuts, I think that this is not a minor issue.

All this being said, I want to make clear that, for me, the strenghts of WK totaly compensate its weaknesses. This may be a difficult game to hit the table but, when it does, it has always provided a great playing experience for my group.

RATING: 5
After two plays, I have some mixed feelings about the game.  I certainly would play again, but prepare for a game that takes some time although the gameplay is rather straightforward.  I made two mistakes early in the game that cost me in the endgame as it took a long time to recover both financially and troopwise (I paid for recruits only to lose them immediately when I didn't have enough money to pay their wages when their wages came due in the same turn I recruited them...oops!  I would also recommend avoiding expeditions as they are primarily a money waster and/or tie up your money too long).  Also, be sure to go with the 15 influence per person in the victory point pool to start the game as the game ends way too quickly with only 10.  Be aware that this will likely only add 1 more turn and at most, two more turns to the game.  Focusing on the gameboard instead of the church and government would also seem to be of higher priority although both grant some nice bonuses or opportunities to pursue free troops, money, influence, etc.

Sold in the game purge in preparation for moving.

This game gets much, much better with more plays.  The first game for me fell flat.  But once I gained a firm grasp of the rules, it got fun really fast.  That took a second game.  Don't pass this up if you like war and diplomacy.  If you don't have the patience to learn the rules, however, you might want to skip it.  But I'm glad I took the time to learn them.

UPDATE:  I have played this more since the comments above and my appreciation grows.  This is gaming at its best.  In my opinion, Warrior Knights is the perfect blend of American-style theme and Euro mechanics.  This game offers players the opportunity for strategic and tactical choices, making it a deep game but not too heavy.  The more I play, the more I discover little things that I could do better for next time.

UPDATE:  Although I still love this game, I have actually traded it away.  The complexity of the rules makes it difficult to get on the table, especially with my game group.  The game offers a rich experience as long as you invest the time in learning the rules.

UPDATE:  Looking back at my comments from more than four years ago, I just have to laugh.  Back then I was a relatively new gamer and really fell for the shiny components of Fantasy Flight games.  Now I know better.  FF games, with a few exceptions, are the equivalent of the hot chick with a rotten personality.  At first you think you're the luckiest guy in the world to date her; that is, until you have to spend day after day with her.  At that point, no amount of beauty can keep you interested.

Warrior Knights, while not the worst offender by a long shot, pretty much fits into this category.  All of the beauty (i.e., chrome) bogs the game down to a point that you just can't enjoy its core, diplomacy.  When the core of a game is sacrificed to the mechanics and chrome, you realize the importance of a game developer.

Warrior Knights is a very complete experience.  There is the wargame aspect, the money aspect, the legislative aspect.  There's so much happening here, but the mechanics are elegant enough you never get bogged down by anything.  Of particular note, the Fate Deck is amazing; combining a dice deck with seven charts and having all of the results ready and waiting for you was a brilliant idea, and I'm kinda surprised that heavier wargames haven't picked up on a similar idea.  The standard game may run a little short, but overall, an exciting experience.

[Played twice]
It's chaotic and very long (if you use a proper amount of VPs; otherwise it ends way too soon to allow any real strategy); action is slow and battles random and bland (the combat cards don't do much).
It features a bit of everything: push your luck (expeditions), resource management (action cards), diplomacy (the assembly), direct confrontation (battles)... and thus comes out as a mess.
It also has a runaway leader problem (and it's especially bad to be a "trailer without hope" after just the first quarter of such a long game).
A wargame they tried to "eurogam-ize": mission failed.

Very nice pseudo-medieval war game (or rather a game about war), lots of stuff to do: you can focus on research (with the expansion), papal influence, politics,  brute strength in army size etc. Quite often the end-game sees a real pile-up-on-the-leader action, so subtlety is key to victory here. Takes the whole evening in the true FFG fashion.

In Warrior Knights, each player takes on the role of a Baron vying for control of the Kingdom. Each Baron commands four faithful Nobles who lead his armies into battle. Each Baron seeks to capture cities in order to gain Influence (victory points), which is used to measure his claim to the throne. Barons may also seek to gain advantage by increasing their income, gathering Votes to use at the Assembly, or by amassing Faith, which can be used to gain a measure of control over chance events. Only through cunning strategy and careful diplomacy can a Baron hope to attain victory.

I enjoy playing with 12 or even 15 Influence per player instead of the standard 10. This makes a long game even longer, but it makes room for some fun intraplayer warfare in the last rounds. The 10-Influence game is still great fun, though. Set aside enough time: We spent six hours on our first game (10 Influence), and another hour of rules explanation before that.

My group have set home rules about the game end. We agree to play 6 to 10 turns (it depends on the available time)  and at the end of the last game round we draw a fate card.If it is a "Revolt!" the game ends immediately, else we continue to play until we draw a "Revolt!" card at the end of a future round.

I honestly really enjoyed this one. There is a lot going on for sure, and depending on the length of the game, it feels like it ends before anyone did much in the way of battles with other players...but I really still liked it a lot.

I loved the action card mechanic in which you choose your 3 sets of actions, and then they all get shuffled in with everyone else's (per phase). Then as they come up they are committed to other action stacks that trigger effects when there are enough cards there.

Components are nice. I don't think I would play this without the expansion.

A rich narrative is created by this highly colourful game, where all decisions seem significant. You are going to be hit by the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, but you can take actions to mitigate the damage, and you do have plenty of leverage over what is going on. I think the action card mechanic is superbly entertaining.

I find the action card system in this brilliant but the game DOES feel too short whilst actually taking a really long time. And i dont mean that in a good way. Even with 15 influence per player when the 4 hours or so are over it feels as though you've only just gotten into things and the end game has just been arbitrarily imposed mid way. By this stage youve only been able to make a few attacks and youd be lucky to control more than six cities.I think you would really need to play this with 30  influence per player to get a full sense of completion however this would just take way too long. Somehow the game just needed to be streamlined, the expeditions would be the most obvious canditate for removal since they have almost no effect on the game. As it stands it feels like the designers had too many good ideas and didnt know which of them to cut.

After a single 3 player game - went much faster than advertized, about just over 2 hours after rules explanation. Really fun game, but needs some rules tweeks. Playing to 15 rather than 10 influence a must. Components are fantastic. 

Played five player last night and thought the game dragged a bit. Haven't tried it, but I have the feeling 4 players might be the sweet spot on this one. It's also become apparent that it's pretty hard to catch up in this game if you fall significantly behind.

Expansion improves this quite a bit, by making movement more dynamic.

I've only played this once so far with 5 players, so it definitely needs a replay.  Although initially all the bits and rules seemed a little heavy, once we'd played through a phase it was actually all quite straight forward.
Our game took 5 hours to play and we didn't actually finish by using up all the influence tokens (although if we'd had time to play one more phase we would have) or one player owning over half the cities.
Definitely gets the brain thinking, and there is potential to play in character here for some added atmosphere.
Looking forward to trying it again although I think it would need to be a weekend rather than an evening!

Played once with five players.  A deliciously meaty, complex game where players control up to four nobles, who wander the board with troops trying to control cities.  The game has a tremendous number of elements to it (controlling cities, attacking other players, maintaining armies, building armies, having enough faith, voting on resolutions, and more), including free wheeling and dealing.  It's also very long; our game took 3-4 hours.

My one concern is that, at least in my first game, two players beat each other up and were clearly out of the game by about 1-2 hours in.  They didn't seem to understand the game, so I'm not sure if it's really a black mark on the game, but being out of a 4-hour game that early in it is frustrating.  But I'll need more plays to solidify my opinion.

Found at a used bookstore for $10.00!!!

Having now played it I can say just how much I appreciate it. It has negotiation, voting, bidding/gambling, card-based combat, order placement, and just enough chance to keep things interesting. Sort of a "kitchen-sink" game, and I think I actually prefer it now to Game of Thrones.
--------------------------
Tragically, after the 2nd play I could see it's flaws--by trying to do everything, it actually does nothing very well, and by the time the game actually gets going it's over. Too long, too fiddly, too much for what it ultimately offers--and a similar, more elegant experience can be found elsewhere.

An excellent mix of warfare, economy, diplomacy and politics. Easily among the best in the genre, WK is incredibly rich in every aspect, and if you don't get lost among all those tiny little details and intricacies, then it'll reward you with the most satisfying experience ever possible in a medieval strategy game. Thus, if the level of complexity doesn't scare you off, then You'll see that Warrior Knights is like a giant clockwork with an incredibly diverse system of relations, where each and every game aspect has some kind of influence on all the others. So, in order to be on top of this, you just have to stay focused and plan your actions accordingly -otherwise everything will collapse with a huge crash! Either way, if you are strong enough to withstand the sheer weight of the system, then Warrior Knights will offer you hours of pure enjoyment!

RATING: 8
This game reminds me of the classic "Kingmaker" in several respects (and some "Twilight Imperium" as well).  Considering the slimmed down rules and ease of play in most games these days, this one appears a little too complex for its own good, but still has great game play, tense decisions, and an integrated theme, not to mention some little plastic bits.  Although, there is "a lot going on," the game settles down after a few turns and really is not "all" that complex.  Rest assured, it is not a euro-style game with simple rules and deep strategies, rather it is closer to its progeny--somewhat complex rules and challenging strategies.  All in all, a solid game and a must for those who want to experience a Middle Ages "Twilight Imperium."
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
The game is interesting, but it looks like a mish-mash of game mechanics present in other games like Twilight Imperium, Wallenstein, and others.  I can't say that was bad, but having played just after above mentionned games, it feels like the pizza you eat for lunch the day after you ordered it.

RATING: 5
UPDATE:  Busywork and fiddly Euroness do NOT a strategy game make, and this game is about as far from Ameritrah as a game can get without being an abstract.  I maintain that anyone who rates this game at all highly has never played an actual good strategy game before, or is an inveterate FFG apologist.  Ironic how both qualities usually reside in the same individual. Rating slashed.

Last night I looked over some of the low scores and comments for this game and I thought you all were a bunch of wimpy whiners.  Well, that was after I got shut out of a 4-player game today after what amounted to a series of egregious first turn mistakes.  After that, it was over, and I mean *over!*  Not like I didn't flop like a fish caught in a net the whole game, but the system is tremendously unforgiving.  You're punished for daring to bid and pay for powerful mercenaries, you're punished for overseas conquests, and did you just leave a city without a knight in it?  BLAMMO!  All that said, it's a near miss.  So many delicious things in this game but like most games from FFG, it looks way better than it is.  Hard to believe this was playtested and rejiggered by some of the giants of the industry.

Lowered from an 8 to 6.5 after another play with a full compliment of people. It can be a fun game, and I enjoy the negotiation and voting, but the many subsystems and lengthy setup and explanation time required means I won't bust this out very often.

My old gaming pet genre. All the numerous mechanics make thematic sense, so they felt easier to learn and teach, but in the end Warrior Knights, the streamlined reimagining of an 80es mammoth of the same name, is still begging for more streamlining and more action on the map.

Fantasy Flight games tend to fall into two categories: Epic games that succeed wonderfully (TI3, BSG, Game o' Thrones), and epic games that fail tremendously (Android, this 'un).

Maybe it was the number of players, or the lack of activity, or maybe it was the AP.  Whatever the case, this was the dullest afternoon of gaming I've had in a while.  It tries to be so much and, as a result, it fails on all levels.

Lento e statico. Questo giocone dal regolamento non semplice fa sentire tutti i suoi anni. Per quanto ambientazione e idea non siano male, il gioco soffre di lentezza e poco divertimento. Dopo una fase iniziale di espansione il gioco procede verso la conclusione e non è semplice sovvertire gli esiti degli avvenimenti. Difficili ribaltoni anche a causa di difficoltà a fare punti vittoria se non con la conquista delle città. Le partire con pochi giocatori potrebbero trasformarsi in solitari, mentre in 6 il gioco diventa ancora più lento. Data la complessità, la lunghezza e lo scarso divertimento non so se ci rigiocherò.

It's beyond me why this is rated as low as it is. A beautiful, sprawling game which requires a solid afternoon to play well (does ANYONE actually follow the game's recommended VP? Everyone I've spoken to throws at least double the amount in). Imaginatively and instantaneously customisable (thanks to the Diplomacy-style Assembly portion of the game), and offfering a veritable treasury of feel-right and strongly-themed game mechanics, this should be the jewel in everyone's collection.

I can feel the huge effort of game design on this game. However the ratio of feeling of achievement versus demand of involvement is too low for my friends and I. Moreover in the games we played, their end came when we just had the feeling to finish our initial setting.

Battle for the land, taking cities, using roads, rivers and mountains to out manouvre your foes armies. Then there's the overseas expeditions and raiding, the political sub-game, keeping the church happy, researching technology AND getting along well enough with the other players to vote on the rules changes that come up during the game and the promotions of individual army generals and player bonuses.

VERY COOL STUFF!

This game combines the best bits from Twilight Imperium and Kingmaker.  Once you've got the hang of the rules (which will take at least one full game I'd say), the game-play is fast and furious.  My only real critisism of it is that it seems to end  just as things are starting to get hot.

Fantastic Euro-style conquest-themed wargame. Lots of meaningful choices, lots of ways to win the game. Highly recommended after initial play. It may run a little long if you're short on time (expect a good game to take 4+ hours).

I just noticed the average rating of this game and I'm astonished. Am I the only player who thinks this thing is just pure genius?

EDIT: I've had a chance to break this old beauty out and play it some more, and it continues to hold up really nicely. This deserves to be an 8 or better and certainly in the top 10 for strategy games. Badly underrated. Highest recommendation.

A great game of medieval diplomacy! This game uses a complex system of action allowance that (under certain conditions) trigger special action phases that can dramatically affect game play. Players have a wide range of possibilities regarding the way they can act upon and interact with game play elements/opponents.
Set up takes above-average time as well as the game itself (estimate average time: 3hours - 4Ps).

- Read the rules carefully, although they are fairly well structured and provide many examples, they are extensive and require you to pay close attention, test play at least once so you get familiar with the game dynamics created due to the rules. Once mastered though, the game is easy to explain, only newcomers to boardgaming might feel overwhelmed by the many things that can be done.

Based on one play: You can see where the A Game of Thrones game got its inspiration. You play as different Barons who fight to gain control of the cities on the table. To do so you must pre-plan your actions which are then drawn at random. You plan six actions in total each turn, which are placed into three piles including two neutral actions. Once drawn you carry out your action thus others may or may not play before you, so you must be ready for unexpected actions by others. This mechanic works really well. You also have some special abilities that you can get, vote on laws and collect money while of course building armies to battle others. The battles and many other events are based on drawing cards that determine the outcomes, you have some control over what you draw and can control other events or have the odds tilted in your favor, another great mechanic. Would really like to play this again soon.

Quando giochi a un capolavoro, il tempo vola e tutto ciò che accade fuori dal tavolo non ha importanza. Warrior Knights fa questo effetto. Un gioco dove l'ambientazione (ben resa da componenti di primissima qualità, seppur di difficile percezione per un daltonico) ben si lega con un sistema di gioco corposo ma tutto sommato snello. La meccanica dei turni è originalissima, così come l'asincronicità degli eventi speciali (l'acquisto dei mercenari e l'assemblea). I poteri ecclesiastici e assembleari aiutano a bilanciare le eventuali egemonie militari di un giocatore. Inoltre, il fatto che i giocatori possano parlarsi, contrattare patti che non sono obbligati a rispettare e fregare gli pseudo-alleati mette un sacco di pepe al gioco. Un paio di difetti, che a mio parere non sminuiscono la qualità di questo gioco: primo, c'è praticamente un solo modo per fare punti vittoria, ed è difficile recuperare uno svantaggio a pochi turni dalla fine; secondo, quando i nobili iniziano a darsele di santa ragione, il gioco sta per finire (questa problematica è parzialmente attenuata con l'uscita dell'espansione Crown and Glory). La sua durata monumentale (una partita può durare alcune ore, e tra setup e ricollocazione dei pezzi nella scatola può volerci anche un'ora buona) rende difficile partite frequenti, ed è un peccato!

This game shines with six players! It´s far from being static if players involved are bloodthirsty enough. Lot of tension and tough decisions! I am acutally afraid it would become too chaotic and uncontrollable once forced march is included from the expansion. It was already so damn tense to keep onto some city - there was always someone who could take it in short time.

Rating based on 2-player learning game.  There's a lot going on here--one of those games where you have no idea what you should be doing for the first turn or two.  But after a learning game I have the gist of it, and I like what I see so far.  It didn't grab me as quickly as Game of Thrones, but there may be more depth here in the long run.  I look forward to playing a full game with more players to really try this out.

RATING: N/A
Enjoyed the first play, although the rules were a little overwhelming and we seem to have played a few things wrong. 

But this is an old school game. Conflict is central,and encouraged not only because losing a battle isn't a big deal, but also because influence, which is the game's name for VPs, can only be obtained through conquest. So, turtling won't get you anywhere. 

There are a lot of interwoven mechanics and a lot of buttons for the players to push. Our first game lasted a long time, but most of it was spent reading the rules and understanding them, so I'm pretty confident that we can play a full 4p game in less than 3 hours. I'm very eager to play this again.

Tentative rating after one aborted game:

I enjoyed this more than expected (I'm not the wargamey kind of guy). There is a lot of good stuff going in the game. I especially like the turn order mechanism (lifted from Targui, right Bruno? =)). 

I experience two problems with the game though: 

1. The economy is so tight and the recruitment is so slow that you never want to take any chances. This might be an early game situation (n.b. we only played half a game - due to time constraints and one player getting bored to pieces), but anyhow it contributes to... 

2. The game's pace is plodding: many subsystems, some AP (due to information overflow - what we now call Fog of Information in our group), some fidliness and so on. Not a single one of these factors is overwhelming but the synergy between them makes for an inefficient gaming experience where you spend a lot of time not achieving very much. 

A low efficiency factor is common with a lot of Fantasy Flight's big games (and generally most games of the popularly labeled "ameritrash" breed). What  can alleviate this is to what extent I as a player can and/or is willing buy in to the story being told throughout the game. 

When it comes to Warrior Knights it doesn't really do it for me, Arkham Horror works for me (even though it's on the fiddly side) and Descent is totally engrossing. I guess my inner life is more populated by eccentric professors and spell weaving mages than kings and generals. =)

Otra reedición por parte de Fantasy Flight Games de un juego ochentero de la Games Workshop. Este es de los que me gustan a mí: largo, SOBREPRODUCIDO A TOPE (unas miniaturas muy chulas, cientos de cartas y marcadores, un tablero duro y resistente) y un alto componente bélico durante el desarrollo del mismo. Dirige a tus nobles caballeros por el territorio y consigue más poder e influencia que los otros señores por medio de la conquista, la diplomacia, la exploración y el comercio. Gran juego, sin ninguna duda.

You can probably play this in 3 hours with either 6 people/10 influence per person, 5 people/12 influence per person, or 4 people/15 influence per person.  The more influence per person, the less abrupt and premature the ending is likely to feel.  (Using the Crown and Glory expansion rules will also make the ending more satisfying for most people.)

RATING: 9
Really great game. It suffers, like El Grande, from the possible runaway leader if the players are not very competitive. Despite that, the fact that you have so many fronts in which to work on makes this for a very entertaining experience even when you are not doing the greatest thing. This game begs to be played multiple times, and for the length, the rules are not too complex. It also keeps you engaged all the time, as you are rarely without something to track or do. I do somehow prefer this slightly over "Game of Thrones", and very likely over "Twilight Imperium" mainly because the theme, mechanics and length manage to convey the same feelings and strategy opportunities without the extra heavy-thinking/optimization requirements.

RATING: 7.5
I really like this game. But my group has not responded all that well to it, so it doesn't make it out very often. I find that the best parts of the game include the battle system, which separates victory and defeat from casualties in a very elegant system; simply going for victory seems like the way to go much of the time, but with experience it becomes evident that preventing and inflicting casualties is also crucial. The fate deck is also an interesting innovation that allows control of several randomized effects without requiring dice. The system for gaining victory points also allows for a great deal of flexibility in setting the game length. I'd really like to play this one more often.

The black horse of my collection.Initial interest in the game was... low. We did many three-player games which didn't last beyond the first round. It seemed that this game would see a lot of dust.

But everything changed when Jokke came in. For four players this game shines and has now grown to be one of the most popular games in my collection.

It's the assembly. And the free trading of gold. A lot of corruption happens between the barons as people are constantly bribed to take actions that favour one baron over the other. 
Don't care about the outcome of this assembly motion? Here's some gold and vote in my favour. Can't decide where to take your army? Here's some gold and take your troops to bear against my greatest competitor. The draft is coming and you're low on gold? You are the enemy of my enemy so I might as well sponsor you here.

Ofcourse the chance for backstab is always a constant. Votes may not be cast in your favour after all. Armies may suddenly move against you.  "Partners" may not always hold to their end of the bargain...

And we're loving it.

Not a bad game, but it never seems to be a good time to play it. A bit too much on the fiddly side, and for evocative games it does not particularly stand out. So when people is up for something complex usually something else is chosen.

The expansion adds to the game, certainly, I never play it without it.

Review after just one play with two players. A game with lots going on and lots to do, which I'm sure is much more exciting -- and confrontational -- with more players.

11/08/2007: I stumbled across Warrior Knights and its expansion while I was at the local gamestore. Went back home, did some research and promptly fell in love with both games. Gameplay experience with Warrior Knights confirms that this is a great purchase!

6/12/2007: Played a 2-player game today. Downtime was noticeably significant, due to the sequential execution of card actions. Rating dropped to 7.

21/01/2013: Dropped rating to 3, due to the significant downtime involved. Terribly detracts from the gameplay experience, especially with more players involved.

Was keen to play this because it sounds good on paper but there first play was really tough and did not click (so far). The rules are very unclear and vague in parts which makes it more of a grind to learn and play than necessary. The game end trigger is a bit rubbish. The 10 influence points per player is too short but playing with the Might is Right variant will just cause the game to go on forever, where was the playtesting ? Maybe it is just because we played the game with three players but there had not been a single PVP confrontation in the whole game, bit dull. Everyone just went for the weak neutrals and hoped for the best.

I still think there is potential here but I wish I would not be so hard to find.

There's a lot to like in this game: knights with varying abilities, a nice system for playing out actions, political jockeying, fortifications, etc. Too bad it chokes on too many sub-systems and fiddly procedures.

A clever game that combines religion, politics, economics, and warfare.  I enjoyed it quite a bit.  The 10 influence length game is perfect for a learning game.  I would definitely increase for a "real" game.  We didn't see much PvP warfare, but we'd probably see more in the next game.  I'm not sure that the FFG "million clever mechanics" actually add up to a better game than the old die-chuckers, but it is an entertaining games.

22-02-2015. Rated after 1 play. You own and conquer lands, get money. Each round in WK works by programming actions. I like the mechanism, although I found it a little downtime inducing. Because you program 6 movements in advance, you continuously have to make choices.. guestimating when you get new stuff and when you need that stuff (in which pile do you put the cards, as they are revealed sequentially..). In the meanwhile, random events happen.. and your opponents actions sometimes forcing your hand by attacking you, laying siege to your favorite city.

The game is NOT incredibly complicated, but the rules are written quite poorly. The game made me interested in the For the Crown expansion. I liked it quite a bit :).

RATING: 6
--Sept2007-- From my vantage point, having never experienced the 1985 version, this one looks like an inspired mishmash of features from other games:  the fate cards inspired by _Up Front_; the mercenary draft by a worker-placement game like _Caylus_; action card selection order from a cousin of _Wallenstein_; troop movement vaguely like _Twilight Imperium_; the assembly cards like the agendas of parliament in _Kingmaker_.  On the downside, the two meta-offices (those that accrue to the players with most votes and most faith) look superficially like the comparable tokens in _A Game of Thrones_, yet proved in practice to be significantly less potent in terms of game outcome.  Similarly, the Overseas Cities tempt one from the top of the board, but seem more a distraction than a viable alternative strategy:  this isn't a Wallace, where any of four or five distinctly different victory paths are available!  The peripheral systems appear to provide color, not strategic options.

Still, I rather enjoyed my first play.  And that despite coming dead last!

Only a handful of plays so far, but I'm liking it. It is a bit of a pain to teach (espeically when the teacher has played only a few times himself :p), but once everyone gets the turn flow down it goes smoothly.
"Might is Right" version is good for two players, not so great for 4+ players (game took forever and was eventually called). A larger influence pool (12+ per player) seems to be the way to go with 4+ players. I really like almost all of the mechanics in the game - only the combat mechanics are so-so. A simpler, more elegant system of combat is needed.

Warrior Knights falls into my favorite catagory of games, Euro-Wargames. Every player has 4 nobles that each have a plastic piece on the board and a stat card off the board. When you add more armies to a Noble, you put that armies card under whichever noble that you want commanding it. Your nobles move around the board and take over cities, which provide VP's and Money. Actions are dictaded by cardplay, but not in the sense of a CDG. I would say its a cross between AGoT and Wallenstein. Actions are things like; Move a noble and attack, Get two Votes, Get one Faith, Enter the Draft, etc. There is also a political deck that allows players to vote on laws or offices, sorta like TI3. Everything in the game is randomized by a Fate deck. Whenever you need to see which noble dies, or if a nobleless city revolts, or a Ship provides money or nothing, or even combat, you draw a card from the Fate deck. Pretty clever I think. Seems to even out in the long run. Also, there doesn't really seem to be that much "turtling", at least not in the games I have seen. Even armies, or sometimes a 2-1, or 2-3, will often clash. The combat from the Fate Deck seems to work better than dice, in you have a choice in what you keep (to an extent). As the game goes on, every choice is tense, and you just wish you could trust the people closest to you not to scew up. :laugh: Lots of strategy, decisions, and laughs, with a little bit of luck in your path, makes Warrior Knights a Winner in my vengeful little eyes.

17/7/2007: I played this game for the first time tonight with two other players. Chris had played the game quite a few times before, Jack (the game owner) and I hadn't. I had, however, read the rules thoroughly that morning as well as (and more importantly) Eric V.'s "Musings on Strategy and Tactics". I won the game 20 influence to Jack and Chris' 8. Now, I *quite* enjoyed the game. I think I've started to realise that I like card hand management games, which you have in Warrior Knights with choosing and ordering your turn actions, and how you attempt to win battles in the game. What I didn't like was that I really pulled away early on points early in the game, and it didn't seem like the other two could catch up easily besides teaming up and fully laying in to me (actually I haven't got much of a problem with that at all, they just didn't do it so I never really felt pressured in the game). The game seemed to end pretty quickly though. We had barely started to lay some spank down on each other and the overall map before we ran out of influence (we were playing 10 influence in the pool each). I think in the future I'll try increasing the starting influence to 12-15 per player, but I'm worried about dragging out the length of the game too much for what is really quite a strategy-light game. I think I'll have to play it a few more times to see if this is the fantasy version of Twilight Imperium 3 that I'm looking for. I think I'd like to buy this game, but I'm waiting to see whether Starcraft is any good first.

I think that the game plays best with 4 players and more influence in the pool. Just played a 6-player game and it was too much downtime and chaos, with very little drama or excitement.

A glorious attempt to almost simulate Medieval Ages without complexity going out of the roof. There are battles, city sieges, overseas rich cities and merchant expeditions, there is faith and a Head of Church, which affect many game elements, there's voting.

Unfortunately, the basic 'move your armies and fight' is almost lost in the chrome. Not only that, but the mobility of your nobles is very limited making capturing other players' cities difficult, it's much more profitable to capture one of the neutral cities if possible rather than fight with another player, and finally, moving your army out of your city risks a revolt and losing it - it's a huge penalty and incentive to turtle if possible.

The game has some other smaller flaws, but another big one is that if you play to the recommended 10 influence limit, the game ends rather prematurely, shortly after the claiming turf phase. If you increase the limit to 15 influence, the game can easily last 5 hours, and it is still possible to play safely with only occasional battles. For such a long game, I feel that not enough happens in it for my taste.

It's still a good game, with some unique mechanisms (giving votes, which are divided into three groups and shuffled), and if you like chrome and long games you can give it a try - if you do however, make sure to play with the For Crown and Glory expansion, which addresses some of the mentioned and unmentioned issues, either completely, or to an extent at least.

RATING: 7
An interesting game. To contrast with the original: biggest difference is that although assemblies are important, it is not even a clear case for them being more important than any one other element - certainly they are not the single most important aspect of the game. And this is kind of disappointing, if unavoidable, and a little strange as so much of the game is familiar. The way that luck is handled - can be mitigated, is dice-less - is interesting. There is still plenty of the uncertainty, but it is far less likely that a random card draw or dice roll will suddenly reverse or finish the game. Money is less important, which was unexpected (eg, there is not a true auction for mercenaries). 

Combat is remarkably similar, but definitely one aspect that is more interesting in how it is handled - the drawing of cards, rather than the mere rolling of dice and consulting a result chart.This effects being more manageable whilst yet less predictable. Fate tokens, and the assigning of good and bad cards by the bishop, are the feature that I find most unappealing, they seem to spoil the theme, but, dammit, gamwise they work pretty well. 

The action selection and planning are a whole new game, and the long and short is that they are a very good implementation of this type of mechanic.  

Verdict: I'd like to think that I would still prefer the original, although it may probably turn out that I actually enjoy this version more. I miss the rhythym of the original, and the fact that Warrior Knights 1.1 was all about the assembly - remember the drama of whether or not a Baron attended. But this was definitely engaging and enjoyable.

This is not a design on its own but a readaptation of the [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1143]older classic[/url].  Nevertheless, even when it can sound contradictory, I'd say that this is the best Faidutti's, although it isn't evidently his style.  This is aleo a  lenghty and heavy game.  Besides, the game may have a [i]rich get richer[/i] problem and some players may be left aside from the run for victory since the very beggining, spoiling in a way the game experience for them.  It certainly feels like [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/987][i]Kingmaker[/i][/url] revisited.

A game I very much admire but am forced to admit is flawed... 

The gameplay mechanics are immensely effective and beautifully evoke the theme of the game. Everything from voting in on issues in assemblies, drafting mercenaries for hire, abusing the power of the pope, financing expeditions to faraway lands, bribing and bargaining with fellow barons - every single aspect of the game makes you feel and breathe the medieval time period it has set before you...

...but where it stumbles is at the end-game scenario. Too often the game ends just when things are becoming more interesting. As soon as we are beginning to settle into this beautifully rendered world, someone attains the arbitrary number of influence points to end the game, robbing the players the chance to continue on towards the glories of battle. Indeed, there isn't much "war" in "Warrior Knights". Too often the game ends before moments of combat can even commence.

Luckily, there are some simple house rules one can add to fix these rather pesky issues - for instance, simply add the number of victory points needed to win, or look at the many other variants other gamers devised on the geek forums. 

It's rather a shame, however, that the game demands the players themselves to further fix these issues - this should have been done in playtesting before it was even published. Afterall, I spent $60 to play a game and not spend time fixing it.

All the being said, this is one of my favorite medieval boardgames I own.

Temporary rating after one 5-players game with 50 victory points.The game seemed very chaotic and some aspects of the game such as the Assembly and Expeditions seemed superfluous and not funny.The game is quite long but ends rather abruptly. Just like other players said, the game ends just when things get hot.That first game is a true disappointment.EDIT:After one more 5-players game with 60 victory points this time, the game is still an awful mess of failed strategies because of too much random in action phase and events. Expeditions and Head of Church are still dull and useless, except to annoy players. Oversea cities are not worth the effort of conquering them except in a 15pts/player game. Drafting is flawed as well : in the very first turns, the player on the last position can get screwed for the whole game if someone manage to buy two merc cards. If you cannot recruit and grab two cities in the first two turns, you can forget about victory and prepare for 4 very long hours.Overall, the game is flawed by too much random and superfluous features that don't only surcharge the game but breaks its precarious balance in some case (events).

There's some stuff I don't like, like that it takes longer than it should to play, and the short/snappy turns are so drawn out it seems like it's not worth moving accross the board... and as people say, it does end just when you get to the interplayer conflict part. But it's not a bad game, it's got some really cool things going for it. I like the fight mechanic, and the turn structure mechanic. It was fun enough after one play that I'd like to play it again. 

7/24/06: I've played a lot more Warrior Knights, and my opinion of it has risen substantially. I like this game a lot. There is plenty going on, and as long as you play with 12 or 15 Influence per player a good amount of stuff gets done. It does take a long time to play, but it's not as bad as I thought it would be in that respect. Probably about 2-3 hours once you know what you're doing, even with the 'extra' influence in the pool.

Esperé más de dos años para estrenar este juego, había oído mucho acerca de su duración y de su dureza. Lo probé en primera partida a 6 jugadores, y me sorprendió muy gratamente. La duración se quedó en 3h y media en una primera partida a 6 jugadores, y no las 5 ó 6 horas que había leído en las reseñas. La explicación y el juego en sí fue muy fluido y sin largas esperas entre acciones.

Es cierto que rezuma un regusto a mecánicas ya antiguas, pero bajo mi punto de vista es una muy digna opción en el nicho de juegos temáticos con amplio rango de jugadores, a terminar en una tarde.

En definitiva, un juego temático, de negociación y muy entretenido, con muchas cosas que hacer.

RATING: 7
At one point in time, this game was on my wishlist.  I'm not really sure why it came off.  Probably because a couple of local folks already have it, and they are the ones I would be playing with anyway.

There are a lot of interesting things going on in the game.  The action selection mechanism where you only have a general idea when actions will occur makes prior planning rather important.  That is, you cannot wait until you need to do something to do it because you might not get it done in time.  You really need to prepare a turn or two ahead of time.  Of course, this can add a significant layer of frustration to the game as well.

The is lots of room for negotiation.  The game I have played have not seen a whole lot of this, but there is certainly the potential depending on the group dynamics.  Interestingly, for a game called Warrior Knights, the games I have played in have not resulted in all that much fighting.  The games have seemed to end just as all out civil war starts.  I'm not convinced this a bad thing.  Because of the way this works it seems that most of the game is setting yourself up for the potential of winning in that very last round.  Interesting stuff.

I should also say, I really like the randomizer deck that literally randomizes everything in the game.  Granted, it's just dice in another form with an occasional lesser degree of randomness depending on what has already come up.  

Overall, a pleasant game that I am happy to play from time to time.  And were it not for other locals already owning the game, I would likely pick up a copy for myself, [05/23/2009]

I think adding additional influence to the overall pool is a definite must for this game. As many others have mentioned the game seems to end too quickly without bumping up the influence. I like this game and the combat doesnt seem to drag on like in other games such as Twilight Imperium. I think what I enjoy the most about this one is that there is enough choices within the game that make you feel as if combat isnt the only aspect behind the core of the game. However, on that note I feel the Crown & Glory expansion really makes this game shine. Minus the "King" variant of course.

RATING: 7
[1.5 plays] We got maybe 1/3 to 1/2 of the way through this when our 5th player showed up. Since we had made quite a few mistakes, slowly learned much about how to play, and were all willing - we aborted the newly declared "learning game" and immediately started over.

This time it went much smoother and a 5 player game took just under 4 hours. I expect it will go slightly faster in the future, but 45 to 60 minutes per player seems a realistic game length. That's a long game with a group of 3  players, and so I think this comparable with epic length games like Conquest of the Empire, A&A, and such.

Anyway, I really liked the atmosphere, the combat system, the various card engines of the game, the artwork and production, and the overall experience of the game. I hope to play it again -  and hopefully soon enough that we don't have to relearn too much stuff. More comments at that time - and I think a good chance of my rating going up a point.

On the negative side, this is very long and I wish there was more direct player conflict.

RATING: 5
Own the original. Am hesistant as to the quality of FFG's remake (FoD was a decent attempt with some rough edges, Arkham Horror was a mess) but time will tell.

Update: The game is a euro-ised version of the original. There is a distinct FFG development flavour over the game (using action cards to drive the gameplay, event cards to determine battles, random modifiers, etc). As such, gameplay is alot smoother and faster than the original. However, this isn't necessarily a good thing.

Alot of points made by the people who gave the game 4 and 5's are valid. 10 influence points is NOT enough as the game ends just as it starts to pick up momentum. Yet with 15 points, a player who locks into a good position and succesfully captures a few cities on his first 2-3 turns will gain enough of an edge to win the game handily.

It's hard to catch up with the leaders owing to the limited actions (a minus against the euro mechanics of the game) and the random events are needlessly abstracted and dull. The way battles are conducted are easy to play out but rather unsatisfying. FFG did a dis-service trying to compact the game so that it plays out in 2-3 hours, resulting in a game that feels like players only begin to scratch the surface when it ends.




=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A solid diplomacy and conflict game with a clever action resolution system, i.e. you choose action cards and then the order is randomized. Better than AGoT because there are more strategic options and less chance of getting marginalized with nothing to do. On the other hand, the game is prone to drag a bit, and it seems to take forever to get your troops into play. Finally, and very superficially, there is something about the "look" of the game that I don't like.

RATING: 6.5
This game is fun and engrossing.  Like many FF games it is very detailed and full of wonderful production value.  The main flaw I found is that, with all the amazing systems for different strategies in place there is still only one way to win.  YOU MUST CONQUEST.  The only way I saw to win influence is to capture cities.  The only way to win by force is to capture cities.  Dance around and play chairman and dominate the voting, be zealous and become the head of the church, invest heavily in trading expeditions.  This things will be interesting and fun, but really have little to no effect on the actual goals of the game.  If they had been intergrated into the victory conditions, say for every turn that you finish as chairman/pope you get some influence, or maybe you could buy influence with your piles of money, this game would have rated phenomenally with me.  As it is it seems to be filled with fun wastes of time in the scope of the game.  Kinda leaves a person feeling both entertained and disappointed at the same time.

On a second play I've decided I don't like it with 6 players.  It seems that with less there might be more control, strategy, and quickness.  With 6 it bogs down and you have less control over what happens.

Doesn't appear to be good on first play. Repeated plays reveal that this game is basically a race to earn most VPs while placing stumbling stones in your opponents' ways and calculating risks (where to attack?, which city to abandon?). It might also appear that the game ends too soon, but my impression is that players attack too late. You shouldn't build up your strength before attacking, but watch for  weaknesses in your opponents' defense (if they even have one).

Erre a játékra tipikusan igaz, hogy ha kevesebbet markoltak volna jobban jártak volna. Jól kitalált játék, amiben hadurak szerepébe bújunk és a legtöbb hódítás elérése a célunk. Jól kitalált a csata, még jobb a hadseregek felépítése és toborzása, illetve az egyéb előnyt nyújtó kártyák megszerzése. De kicsit túlzásba vitték a játékban a lehetőségeket. A felfedezés része és a két szerep szerintem nem biztos, hogy szükséges volt a játékba. Mindenképp érdemes kipróbálni, mert egy jól kitalált harci játék.

[2012-06-02]
Második partira két és fél év után került sor. A véleményem nem sokat változott. Talán az volt most zavaró, hogy mindössze 5 kör volt a játék, mégis 3,5 óra volt 4-en, tehát nem rövid, illetve, hogy egy körben egyet tud lépni egy nemes és máris kifárad, így nagy csatározásokra nem lehet játszani, mert nincs rá elég idő. A szerencsének is rendesen van a játékban szerepe, a bonyolultságához képest lehet kicsit több is, mint elvárható. A pontszámon azonban nem rontok, mert sok jó ötlet is van a játékban.

In some ways I think this game is very clever.  I like the design of the system, but I am just not a fan of how it operates.  The biggest problem for me was how impossible it felt to catch up.  In many ways this is a game of efficiency that relies heavily on the chaotic timing of other players with a little luck from the cards.  If you fall behind, while it is not improbable that you can get back in the game, it seems impossible to plan for it.  Often when you are behind the best option that you have is to camp out and hold what little you have.

Forward strategies are very difficult to plan as often the cards you would need to use to accomplish anything are caught up in the works.  As the game progresses you are often playing all (or near all) of the cards that you have every turn.  Therefore your choices are dictated by what was spit back out at you.  You make your decisions based on what order you MAY get the cards used.  Of course, unless you waste time trying to figure out what everyone else has, you can't really make any accurate predictions of what actions that others will take, other than board position (which does not equate to what people can actually do).

While it isn't a big payoff to go for the pope or the chairman, there are advantages.  If you use your cards to go for it, you have to wait for them to cycle through, which means that you can create a strategy around fighting for these positions.

Movement is difficult in the game, so getting around is frustrating especially when your cards are tied up for activation.  While you get two general purpose cards the move/attack is slowed down dramatically, encouraging camping for money.  

You especially want to camp unless you can take another city that round as you don't want to leave you cities defenseless nor do you want them to go into a revolt.  If you lose a city the rich get richer and you fall dramatically farther behind the curve. 

The combat system is kind of boring, unless you can draw enough cards to take out someone's entire army, all cards but the victory cards are useless.  I guess it is not worse than dice, but rolling for sixes isn't the cleverest system, you know?  Because there are different options on the cards, it gives a thinly veiled illusion that there is something more here, but really there isn't.

The exploration area while cute is just way too risky for the pay out.  It seems like tying up your money for an indefinite amount of time for the potential of a small return (if you don't just lose it outright) doesn't seem worth it.

Overall, I have to say I had a good time for the first half of the game and then I felt that all control was handed over to the system and the leaders (as the leaders can outbid for bonuses to put them farther in the lead).  After a while I felt like those in the back where there only to act as an AI against the leaders.

To make matters worse, the game is made easier for Leaders to attack the players who are doing poorly which lengthens the gap and chaotically determines the placement for the losers.  So, I didn't feel that you could even fairly fight for third to keep your interest.

I've played with the recommended 15 points and I think it just prolongs the helplessness of those that are behind.  Yet, clearly 10 is just too short.  Perhaps 1 VP should be awarded for taking a leader's or the second place player's city.  This would give people a plan for victory, a way to catch up, a reason to attack people earlier, a reason for the first place player to attack the second place player and vice verse instead of weaker players.

I'd love to hear how the bottom right isn't the best position on the board, because it sure seems like a clear winning spot.

RATING: 7
The turn order structured with cards is ingenious, it keeps every player engaged and limits AP which automatically makes it a beacon of light in the mulitplayer wargame world.  The other card uses are not special but work very well.

It suffers from an unvarying board (which could have easily been fixed, Settlers of Catan style) and a sense that the game is over just when it's becoming interesting (our group starts with all of the cities and we play for all of the victory points in the game).  Making defensive turtling less viable and daring attack with faster movement more rewarding would speed up the game.

After about five plays, I'm starting to like the game less and less. It just seems fairly repeditive, and can really start to drag after a while. So far I've only played with either twelve or fifteen influnce per player, maybe I'll like it better with only ten. Fighting especially feels like a drag, and never feels like it really matters. Movement is also irritating, either being so slow or too fast.
I wanted to like this, but I'm just not too excited by it. Still, it has some good mechanics, and can be fun at times, just not my favorite.

The game is sort of Game of Thrones meets Wallenstein. Players (Barons) control 4 nobles. They start with 6 armies that you can allocate amongst the nobles as you see fit; a noble without an army may not be on the board. Board shows 18 kingdom cities (fewer with <6 players) and 6 foreign cities. To win, control more than half the unrazed kingdom cities at any time, or have more influence when the game ends (when all influence in pool [size varies with player number] is gone). Each round there are 3 steps. Each player has 12 order cards that allow various actions (move/attack, gain votes, gain faith, get in line to buy mercenaries, etc.). Each chooses 2 for each step. 2 more neutral actions are added to each step. Then, all order cards are shuffled in each step, and resolved one at a time: when your card comes up, you may do that action (neutral cards affect everyone, or specify which player acts). These cards are mostly set aside into 1 of 3 areas (each order card is color-coded); when enough cards of a color are set aside (2 x number of players), an event occurs and the cards are returned to the players. The events are: bid for agenda items (blind bid using vote markers, similar to GoT bidding with influence markers; EVERYTHING bid is lost) that are generally quite good; earn income (based on value of cities you control); pay wages (for your mercenaries) .... You can also invest in ships to Ceylon/Spice Islands/China, and try to take the foreign cities (income value). ALL random results are determined by drawing from fate deck - each card has a random noble, region, revolt result, etc. After all steps are complete, players gain influence from the pool based on the cities they control. Some cities may revolt (if your army isn't there). If all influence is gone, game ends - person with most influence wins. Otherwise, repeat everything using whatever order cards are left in your hand.

Given that I like AGoT a lot (and Wallenstein some, too) I would expect to like this more than I did. It played well, and the fate deck workes quite nicely as a randomizer. I liked it enough to play again! But for some reason the second game seemed to drag a bit, and felt repetitive (the constant shuffling of cards, etc.). Only a 6/10 for now; prob won't go down, but could definitely go up.

A somewhat fiddly, fussy game which brings in a nice helping of different aspects of conquest in the Middle Ages. Lots of strategic options, but it really over-complicates combat, and its basic game, as others have noted, doesn't go on long enough to allow players enough time to really get into the full possibilities of movement, expansion and conflict. Think about using the variant in the rulebook which adds Influence to the starting pool or you may wonder why the game ended before it seemed to truly begin.

There are many elements in Warrior Knights that can be said to be typical Fantasy Flight Games Elements: Neat art work, huge piles of solid components, beautiful miniatures and complex rules. While this often has been a successful recipe for Fantasy Flight Games, Warrior Knights seems to have missed it's target. 

Playing the game actually feels more like playing a set of different mini games with questionable relations to each other. Also, the game is horrendously long, which combined with it's randomly determined player turn order, often results in extreme amounts of down time.

The cards will reveal all you need to know!  (I should warn you before I proceed any further that this is a first-impression rating and comments.)  So back to those cards.  Warrior Knights really feels more like a card game than a board game, which is one reason that I didn't enjoy it quite as much as I thought I would.  It is by no means a bad game mind you.  It certainly has some very unique and interesting mechanics regarding how action cards are utilized.  But there are a couple of things that don't quite work, such as the oft-mentioned and easily remedied problem of the game suddenly ending just as the final neutral cities are being grabbed and the more direct player conflict is about to begin.  And, like most games, it really takes one full game to figure out how everything works together and to develop a logical strategy with which to move forward.  In the end, it wasn't that I didn't enjoy the experience - rather, I just wasn't really "wow"ed by it.  Game design: 3.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 2.5/5  Total: 6/10

[FFG 06 edition] {War; variable-player-order, voting, trading, blind-action selection, no-winner; optimal 4-5p} {7.0 basic game; 7.5 for 15-influence game} Warrior Knights is an interesting war game with a strong theme. It's different from other war games because it uses "Fate" cards to determine the victory of a war, instead of dice.

The rule is quite long but it easy to read and understand because it's intuitive.  The FAQ should be read to handle some special situations.

The game components are nicely made. The illustration of the board and card are good and informative. The miniatures are pretty and sturdy. It is a little bit fiddly to track the number of cards in each special phase.

Similar to Wallenstein, WN requires good planning, instead of reactive, decisions. Players have to plan their actions wisely in the 3 phases - they have to guess how other players acts, when will the special phases occur, etc.  It's slightly random because of the 'Fate' cards - the largest army has a higher chance of winning with more 'Fate' cards, but it's not necessary. (I like this chance of winning.) There are many decisions and player interactions in WN, which brings many funs.  Besides, I like the negotiation element of WN, which enhances player interaction and fun.

WN is not a very deep game. Turns and actions are usually short. The longest party of the game would be the Assembly due to (heavy) negotiation.

In a 10-influence game, WN ends abruptly when every player completes the initial work and city siege and is ready for large battle.  WN is much meatier when 15 (or even more) influences are used, even though it takes a longer time to play (around 2.5-3 hours for 6 player). 10-influence can be used to let the players understand the game, but it'd be avoided for a complete game.

[Expansion] I am looking forward to playing the expansion.

This game hits a sweet spot with me: A lot more to it then to RISK, as an example, but still playing considerably fast due to the "one player, one action"-card system, which keeps you involved all the time. Like a lot of these games, it tends to have a "the rich get richer" issue, as, for example, players with the most cities also have the most money, the most influence in council AND the most victory points per turn.
It's fun, though.

Takes too long to be over too fast.

Lots of really interesting mechanics and ideas, including the action system and the variety of areas to the game; political, military and economic.  However, the game seems essentially flawed; it just doesn't run long enough (in turns) for much to happen, yet still manages to run too long in playtime.  Due to the extremely short game, any minor early advantage tends to decide the win.

I've seen the comment that it "takes too long to be over too fast"; a perfect description.

A warfare/role selection/area control/ strategy game with a political mini game tacked on, but it works fairly well.

I'd need to play this again as we had no conflict in a three player game and that may be because of a first play, but the board just doesn't seem condensed enough to force it. Perhaps that a good thing but I'd need to play it more to determine.

There's a lot going on here so it's a pig to learn, but it might just be worthwhile.

Excellent remake of the original (THE classic boardgame of my youth).  However, with the recommended influence points (10 per player) the game ends just as its getting exciting.  While the mechanics are terrific, the short playing time means that hardly any Important Events or Assembly agendas are discovered, a pity as they are both improved on the original.  I think the longer variations (15 influence per player or taking over half the cities) will make this game the classic it deserves to be.

RATING: 7
For the first game,took almost 2 hrs 2 explain the game and 4 hrs to play it! That is not counting the amt of time used on reading and familiarizing the rules, it almost sounds like work! First game play is foiled by uncertainty with certain rules (despite all the time spent reading it) and unfamiliarity which leads to several mistakes. Nonetheless, a game with potential because of its many interesting mechanics. Will try again and hopefully the experience will improve. Not likely to be played often though because of the length of play, and I shudder to explain it to a new set of players! :)

I will admit that conflict oriented games are not usually my cup of tea so my even having this one goes against the normal grain of my collection, however I do have friends that like this style of game and of the BULK of the ones I see out there that would satisfy the small bit of grognard in me this one seemed to be a good one.  I like the mechanic of placing cards into three different stacks and then allocating them to trigger different events, and the assembly with its votes is also very fun.  I have never seen money fly around to pay off bribes like I did in the game that I have played.  It is not one I will pull out a lot, but for those times I am in the mood for that style of game, this one is among the few I would choose.

Great game with alot of different actions to chose from to play.  There are numerous variants for victory conditions to suit your gaming group.  I have dropped my rating on this game after playing a 4  hour 5 player game where the game mechanics and base victory conditions left little chance for those behind by more than 1 pt to make any comeback.  It will probably be hard to bring this one back to the table although I think it has promise with more tactical game expertise which is hard to gain on a first playing.   EDIT: Adding the expansion really improves this game boost rating up to 8.0 with expansion.

RATING: 10
Great game.  Used to play original back in the day, this is much better. Love all the little mini games.  Even with expansion it doesn't have an unmanageable amount of bits, so set up and tear-down is quick for a game of this type.  It also fits, even with expansion, in a normal sized box!.  Some cool mechanisms in this game. The action card system is nice (and keeps rule explanations down) plus the triggering of taxation, Wages etc is to some extent under player control.  The games mechanisms has the players constantly bouncing off each other.  

3 player game took us 5.5 hours with 15vp per player, 4 hours using 10vp (King Module).  

Note: The expansion is necessary.

For me its up there with Runewars, TI3, Forbidden stars.  Warrior knights has the advantage of playing up to 6 with a easier/smoother ruleset but just as much variance, and diplomacy is probably done best in this game.  Brilliant epic game with remarkably streamlined rules.

A must have!

Better than most overly-chromed Fantasy Flight "war" games. The crowded board and race for victory points lends some nice tension to the game. The Church event cards are too random for my tastes, which can lead to arbitrary point swings late in the game. At least the player is offered a modicum of control by obtaining faith tokens (is that what they're called?). I consider this a vast improvement over such fare as Twilight Imperium. Nonetheless, for such a potentially lengthy game, I prefer a richer strategic experience.

I compare the game to my recent play of FF's Game of Thrones, another game that isn't to my taste. Both are long, multi-player affairs that cater to players interested in the [i]experience[/i] of play even if it comes at the expense of tight game-play where swings of fortune bring on the unexpected. I say this because there were times when I was playing WK that the excitement of the unexpected got to me, and I found myself caught up in the sweep of events hoping I'd come out on top. If the game could have sustained that feeling, I'd be rating it much higher. However, in the end, what I found is that those moments were too far apart. The downtime and frustration of bad luck was too much to bear.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a pretty good fairly freeform attacking game with tons of mechanisms thrown in.  There's bidding, building up armies, attacking, sieges, defending, random events, drafting, special powers, and economics in money, faith, and votes.  Oh, and a negotiating element.  Nevertheless, it doesn't feel complex.  I think players have to have a "roll with the punches" sort of attitude to enjoy this game.  Players can get attacked when they're down, lose cities to revolts randomly, etc.  I can imagine some players getting pretty annoyed at some of that.

I enjoy playing WK, but its flaws are more glaring than its strengths because it doesn't live up to its potential.

Essentially, it's inefficient, thematically-dry, and overly random.  They should have either: a) trimmed the fat and some of the luck for it to be a streamlined and shorter strategy game (like Vinci), or b) add to its epic scope by making the numerous sub-games actually have significant effects and by filling out the contours of the theme.

Really, it's a game that wants to be bigger than it really is.  I probably wouldn't find it so disappointing if I wasn't comparing it to other "big" FFG games done better.

UPDATE: the expansion is an improvement by adding elements that are actually significant.  I'll never play just the base game again.

RATING: 5
I read about how this game ends way too soon here on bgg, so I thought to place 12 instead of 10 influence points per player in the pool. Still, it ended too early. Up to that point everyone was still concerned with building up the own armies and capturing neutral cities. Maybe that whole influence thing should be left out and only winning condition is capturing equal to or more than half the cities on the board. Maybe that way there'd be more tension in this game.

The elements of this game that are enjoyable are bogged down in tedious rules that aren't really necessary. Every time it seemed like they'd gone too far, they added one more element. I think this game struck the wrong balance between fun and realism.

Warrior Knights, '06 Version, from FF is potentially a great game, but it just isn't long enough from a construct perspective. . .

The game calls for 10 influence a player, we tried it that way a couple of times and that didn't work, so we then tried 15 but it looks like 25 or play for city control might get the best out of the game. . .overall the blended mechanics really make this game feel different, which makes it enjoyable to play until the end. . .the end game is very anti-climatic and should have been tweaked a bit in my opinion. . .I am curious to see what the expansion will look like in 2007. . .

Nice clean mechanics and just the right amount of chaos for my personal taste.  We also (after three games) notice that it seemed to end as it was getting interesting - also that it was tough to catch early leaders.  I suspect the answer to both issues is that when you fall behind in city conquest, you must turn to cities controlled by the leader and spurn the easier neutrals.  It should be easy to find support for such moves.

I wanted to like it more than A game of thrones but it falls short. For the amount of pieces you have to fiddle with, you'd expect a deeper game.

RATING: 4.5
(Sigh)...I really, really wanted to like this game. And when I saw the box and its components I was really excited. Unfortunately, it turned out to be worse that the original Warrior Knights. WHY?
What I really dislike about the game is its static nature. It takes AGES for the Nobles to get anywhere on the board. Also, I dislike the action system, which does not give a player enough influence over the play order of a round. It is true that the original was in desperate need of streamlining, but FFG went overboard with that. I miss ye olde atmosphere :-(.
Bottomline, if I want to play a game like this, I would much rather play something like Wallenstein.
UPDATE: Played the game with the expansion (Crown And Glory), and that combination makes for a much, much better gaming experience! I love the elements that the expansion took from the original, and the 'refresh' cards make the nobles move much more quickly around the board. As such, I give the expansion a much better rating (the base game is still pretty bad without the expansion after all).

Medieval politics and warfare.  Strategy boardgame.

A superior game.  The components are excellent and the game has such a rich variety of possible player activity that the game is a real pleasure to play.

Having now got to play this game, I'd agree with the prevailing view that you need one game to properly get to grips with the mechanics and how the rules work. But once you've had that game, you're likely to be wanting more, as you can then see the beauty of it. It does take a while to play a game, but this can be shortened by reducing the amount of starting Influence tokens in the pool. However, as others have said, I feel this would impact negatively on the overall gameplay, as it would leave you with not enough turns to fully work out a strategy. Basically, I would say resign yourself to it being a fairly long game and organise your time for it accordingly, rather than artificially lop off the end-game. In the long run, I'm sure you'll find it makes for a more enjoyable game.

There are good ideas in here, but the game is too slow. Troops can only be recruited by a special phase which is triggered too rarely. Some events are far too powerful, like: "all swiss mercaneries are gone from the board" which can be devastating, especially with the expansion, which adds leaders so one is encouraged to hire mercaneries from only one land...

After it is okay, but way too lengthy for what I gives to me so I'm going to spend my time on some other games.

Abit too random to my likings. Run away leader and kingmaking problems. Plays too long for what it is, especially when its clear you cannot catch up with someone who came to an early lead.

One of the purest and best dudes-on-a-map games out there.  Make sure you play the long game (15 influence per player) for best results.  The game lets you do all the best parts of dudes on a map games -- the expansion, building your empire, and a bit of skirmishing, but then ends before the pull-down-the-leader aspect becomes exhausting.  Getting out to an early lead and trying to hang on is a viable strategy.

The icing on the cake is a wonderful action selection system, that gives you a lot of control, but less ability to time those actions.  Good play involves both short-term tactics and long-term strategy.  It's important to consider what the other players are likely to do, whether you will get your precious action cards back for the next planning phase, and whether your card will even be useful to you by the time it comes up.  If you're a fan of multiplayer negotiation or war games, you should definitely check this out.  For those of you familiar with the old Avalon Hill game [gameid=987], this is a much, MUCH better game using the same principles.

Approachable "war game" for this fan of the Euro style games.  After one play (6 players/5 newbies) now understand all of the elements and details.  Look forward to a future play with my own experience.   If someone takes control of the action decks, it will move at a good pace.

The game has a lot of nifty bits and pieces that promise a lot, but don't quite seem to come together. Too long for the fun it offers. Unlikely it will see our table again, although I would try again if asked.

RATING: N/A
It's chaotic and very long (if you use a proper amount of VPs; otherwise it ends way too soon to allow any real strategy); action is slow and battles random and bland (the combat cards don't do much).
It features a bit of everything: push your luck (expeditions), resource management (action cards), diplomacy (the assembly), direct confrontation (battles)... and thus comes out as a mess.
It also has a runaway leader problem (and it's especially bad to be a "trailer without hope" after just the first quarter of such a long game).
A wargame they tried to "eurogam-ize": mission failed.

Interesting update to the old GW classic. It plays very fluidly, but out of the box the game ends, before the real fun begins. Game length can easily be extended to create serious conflict on the board, but for that to occur real play time also increases dramatically. If play time vs. significant player conflict could be improved, it would be an even better game.

Приобрел в порядке эксперимента. И пока особо не распробовал.

Заранее смущает динамика партии - вроде после захвата 4-х городов высовываться куда-то еще опасно - это грозит восстаниями. Идея сражений интересна, но как в случае скажем с Ганнибалом - они не очень похожи на настоящие, что минус. Ну и управляемость битвами - под вопросом. Тоесть победа достигается подводом более многочисленной армии, немного удачей и как бы "покерным" выбором.

A Game of Strategy, Warfare, Negotiation and Bluffing.
\13\\13\
Players balance military force with economic investments and careful diplomacy, hoping to build the most powerful armies and wield the greatest influence. During the Assembly , players negotiate treaties and backroom deals, winning concessions, titles and appointments. Do you have the ruthless cunning and iron will to seize the throne?
\13\\13\
In Warrior Knights, each player takes on the role of a Baron vying for control of the Kingdom. Each Baron commands four faithful Nobles who lead his armies into battle. Each Baron seeks to capture cities in order to gain Influence, which is used to measure his claim to the throne. Barons may also seek to gain advantage by increasing their income, gathering Votes to use at the Assembly, or by amassing Faith, which can be used to gain a measure of control over chance events. Only through cunning strategy and careful diplomacy can a Baron hope to attain victory.

It took forever to learn all the rules and I'm sure there were details we missed, but I finally got to play this. The different systems worked surprisingly well together. I think my score could go up at least a little with more (and more streamlined) plays.

Own both versions and am happy to announce the new one feels as much fun as the original, after some initial comnfusion over when things actually happen, once we worked it out the game seemed to go pretty fast, its a socio-political wargame set in the middle ages, its fun and the new version is done with the usual FFG dash in the bits department. Well worth the shekels

RATING: 7.8
Another great update by FFG to a classic game.  The voting seems more clear in this game for some reason.  As usual, the bits and cards are great quality.  If you don't have the original, this one is worth the purchase.  Plus you're never really out of it in this game as a lost noble comes back as an heir.

Strong game.  Good systems that hang together seemlessly.  Suggest playing with 4 or more.  Great art, many choices.  Reminds me of a game that has the best parts of AH's Kingmaker and FFG's Game of Thrones.

RATING: 6.75
I have mixed feelings about this one.  It is a fun experience, but I don't think it is a particularly good game.  I don't see any way for players who start out badly (due to other people's attacks or random events) to catch up.  Similarly, other than a complete "bash the leader" or kingmaker solution, there isn't really any way to hold an early leader back.  There are lots of fun mechanics in the game, and it doesn't outstay its welcome, but it just didn't live up to its promise for me.  The assembly could have been a lot more interesting, but it seems relatively pointless.  The important events can be too devastating to one person.  I definitely think that you need to play the longer game (we played with 12 vp/person, and it was still too short by a turn or two).  I'll definitely play it again sometime, but I doubt my rating will change too much.  For a quasi war game, I'll probably pick Wallenstein or TI3 or something else over this one.  Played again with expansion - Assembly was more interesting, but other than that, my earlier comments were right on.

RATING: 6.5
Rating after two plays. Is pretty fun, but the card play being relatively random can really screw you over. 10 influence in the pool also isn't enough, (at least with 4 players). The biggest issue I have with the game is the difficulty in doing anything. Movement is so slow, and with a Baron only able to take one action per turn, it is very hard to get into position to even make the attacks you want. Seems like the game is mostly about playing the "engine" of the game the best, as the randomness of the cards and the turn order makes tactical planning very difficult.

I like this game, but movement is simply too slow -- even with the new action cards and advancements available in the Crown and Glory expansion.

Also, too much of the early game is spent on the establishment of initial control of cities.  A "quick start" set-up would help get things moving.

UPDATE:

We now routinely play with two variants: (1) base/road movement is 2/5 rather than 1/3, and (2) players receive immediate control of the first 100-strength city in which they place one of their nobles.  15-18 influence per player is also highly recommended.

Now the game is actually fun!

SECOND UPDATE:

Rating downgraded.  I've lost my enthusiasm for Warrior Knights because it's too easy/efficient for players to shoot for combat victories via "victory" counts rather than actual combat losses.  That's just silly - as well as unforgivable in a game that is supposed to be combat driven.

A real shame, as I like the assembly and other aspects of the game quite a bit.

Got it for my birthday. I love the idea!!! Finally after almost a year from getting it  I have managed to explain the rules to some friends and got it played. I really enjoyed it. So much to do. I love all the options and things you need to consider. It is great!!!

I like the fact that the game length can be easily adjusted by adding more or removing some of VP.

My only complaints are:
- Explaining the rules makes people go like: "This is way too complicated ..."
(After you play a little all comes naturally though)
- Games tends to end when it starts to get really hot. But maybe this is good as probably from this point on it would just drag and the winner would stay the same.

EDIT: I am afraid that difficulty in explaining this game could kill it!

A bit long, so I don't get to play it as much as I'd like to. With 8 influence per player and all the addon variants except the Kings Army it's playable in 2 hours and a half with 3 players. 

It's a good game, I just don't see all the strategies and I'm not sure if it's a GREAT game. To be determined!

Many comment that the game ends as things get interesting.  A few house rules have changed that for us.  We start with more armies per player, a bit more gold and a faith token for each.  Picked up a few other variant rules from the forums as well, such as adding more influence tokens.  This is one of the those games that takes variants well. The stock rules make the game progress too slowly in our opinion.

Overall a fun one, but still takes 4 hours realistically. I really love the theme, which come accross extremely thick (coolness). Feels more like Ameritrash than Game of Thrones, although both are really close in play.

Rating after two games with 3 players. Very mixed feelings. It seems that compared to time spent, you have very little to do. Ok you seemingly have many choices, but I don't know, not many good ones.. I'll get back after couple of games more, and hopefully with more people.

With 5 players this was a lot different experience. Tension was much higher and game was actually very enjoyable, but still the original mixed feelings stayed.

Just purchased this one as it caught my eye as being a kind of medieval Twilight Imperium.  Looking forward to playing it soon.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is like Twilight Imperium light. It looks like a war game with a lot of battles and fights but it's more of a build an army and threaten the other players with it, not necessarily using them. The fun lies in negotiating for votes, event cards, blessings, military acces and so on. 

Other good points : 
* no downtime - everyone selects all actions before a round begins. 
* no dice , but cards (they reduce randomness) 

Some minor negative points : 

* 10 influence per player as per setup gives to short games (there is a 'king' variant in the expansion with more influence)
* neutral cities reduces player conflict 
* hard to keep track of other players armies 
* complex rules for what it is !
* there isn't much action on the board for a game called warrior kings due to restrictive movement and rules like revolts, also turtling is more beneficial once you have captured the neutral cities that are neighbouring your capital. 
* church title is useless if the blue neutrals events are on top.

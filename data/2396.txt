Very risky using 1830 in the name and incorporating so many nods to that classic.  In fact, the game play is quite different, unique even.  Played and enjoyed three times.  My only concern is about replayability as the order in which kingdoms "float" is quite structured.

My issue is not with the game but with the publisher's policy. I do not like the destination that the policy leads to. It leads to a flooding of bad games and good games with substandard production reaching higher prices. As a consumer i object to that scenario hence the rating.

An interesting twist on 18XX.  Land ownership represents shares in the company that contains the land.  However, land value is independent of companies (and most companies have all land types) and at game end land value is what pays out no company value.  OTOH, company "routes" is what pays dividends each round, so both need to be managed.  It's a good game and I'd play it again but it's not one I'll suggest.

18XX are not my thing, but so far this is the game in that genre that I have enjoyed the least. Feeling out of contention before turn 1 (after the private auction) did not help either. Not for me.

Like the title suggests, this is 18XX BC, with canals instead of railways but some other twists and more innovative than that description suggests.  Interesting premise but the delivery doesn't quite match.

RATING: 5
Looked like it was a game that would improve with more play, but in fact it tailed off. The play is too constrained; all kinds of things you *could* do, but in reality the number of strategies that are at all reasonable is painfully limited. The game also really seems to need to go about one more turn. Disappointing, as it had a lot of good ideas and promise, but couldn't quite deliver.

RATING: 6
Hilariously bad train wreck of a game about real estate speculation and development in the cradle of civilization.  Strong candidate for 'so-bad-it's-good' status, but only for rail game fans.  Players seeking anything like a coherent game should stay far far away.

The major moving parts of this game connect at the strangest places imaginable and so the game moves along like one of those funny cartoon robots whose motion doesn't make any sense.  Ready?

Landowners get paid (personally) when land they own gets irrigated.  Irrigated land also generates money for the state that irrigated it (which is not necessarily the same state as the one in which the land is physically located).  The state can either keep that money in which case it has to dismantle some of its irrigation system (OK ...), or it can pay it out as dividends to its landowners.

Calculating dividends is a simple multi-step procedure where you take the amount of money raised, divide it by the number of pieces of land sold in that area and ignore the remainder.  Each shareholder then multiplies that number by the number of pices of land they own in the nation and collects that sum from the bank.  Then, add up the total dividend paid out, and subtract that number from the original amount raised.  Pay the resulting figure into the state's treasury (usually 3 or 4 dollars).

Now it's time to adjust land on the stock market!  States don't have stock values but land does.  Apparently the stock market is run by a somwehat easily-excitable cartel of real-estate representatives from all six states.  To determine how much a land type goes up, simply count how many 'regions' have geen irrigated of that type.  A 'region' is a landmass with a different definition than a land area or a state, and all types of land exist to some extent all over the bord.  This means that if you have invested in mountains in some garbage state with a lousy irrigation system and an unfriendly king, but over in Persia, mountains are getting irrigated like crazy, your land value goes up up up!  It pays to be a slumlord when you have a cartel doing all your price-fixing for you.

Similar nonsense ensues in the stock rounds where buying land that hasn't been bought before (basically, IPO shares) costs a fixed par value.  Again, forests in the ghetto cost the same $90 as forests in paradise.  The relationships between a state, its land, and its actions during operating rounds are so bizarre it makes my head spin.

It's not all bad, though.  For what it's worth, we had a lot of fun playing this one.  Drawing canals directly on the board is sort of a blast.  The way irrigation works is a great little logistical exercise: calculating how to get water from rivers, through reservoirs and pumps, and finally to land hexes can be delightfully tricky.  Awesome multi-function 'train' cards that can either function as diggers (which build track and go obsolete like trains) or waterworks on the board.

The train rush is pretty much instant.  Once it starts, the game will be over within two ORs either because of bankrupcy or because the technology will get good enough for everyone to develop the board really quickly and finish the game that way.  Stock rounds are quite volatile: because of the extremely permissive (but kind of weird) rules about buying and selling stock, you see mad rushes where hostile takeovers are attempted, both sides needing to fund their side of the war with income from selling off land elsewhere.  This will happen about once in each country.

I'll continue to suggest this game to fans of 18xx games, but really more for its novelty and bizarre dream-logic than anything else.

A novel and good idea that ultimately doesn't work very well.  There's a disjoint between the property values and the values of the shares of various companies, which makes the game not work very well.  I want to like this game more than I actually do.

RATING: 8.5
Components: standard as a Splotter game
Complex: hard to learn and to teach
Weight: heavy
Players: 4-5
Length: around 3 hours
Opinion: a nice twist on 18XX family, not only because you manage the terrain of ancient nations in UR, but because there are more connections between things to consider. Nations grows with terrain as shares, and build waterworks to increase their value, but this can be done in any place on the map, therefore, you have to consider 3 different things to win the game... the terrain value, the canals dig and the waterworks built... and the 3 of them can be done anywhere in the map.
The game also modify how the "trains" run as it is not done when the nation finish its turn, but think that all this stuff is done in a separate phase.
I really loved the game

There's nothing about an 18xx game that provides me any form of enjoyment, and so the prospect of spending another three hours(at minimum) per session at least half a dozen more times just to progress past the conscious incompetence stage is unappealing. The strategies and tactics of this genre will forever remain opaque to me.

After owning this for 2 years, I finally set it up and started exploring it.  Immediate concerns popped up:  my board is badly warped, and the counters while servicable are not very nice.

But is there a game here?  Yes.  It is rather confusing to sift throught the rules, but discernable.  The thing is, though, I have recently played Poseidon, and it seems to occupy the same space as this game, but do a better job.  (Nice components, imbued with that basic 18xx feel, but Poseidon actually plays comfortably in an evening.)

I am unconvinced that this game will work for us. By reports read, I think this is a longer (4-hour) game, making it not work for weeknight gaming, and if we are going to play a longer game of this sort, plenty of 18xx games will jump ahead of it in the queue.

Being a 18xx-fan, Ur1830 is for me the essence of all good 18xx-things. Played it again yesterday, and it struck me how well thought out the intertwining mechanisms are. Excellently themed, also. High praises to the Splotter team! :-)

Played once. Board felt too large with 4 players, i.e. players kept to themselves in their corner; with little or no interaction; and it took too long to get the regions activated/game started. Rules was unstructured and difficult to interpret. Advantages of some free-nations seemed too powerfull.  Rating might imporve with another play and better understanding of rules.  

Update: I've acquired "1830"; now "Ur: 1830 BC" seems just a poor spin-off!

Interesting and intriguing, but ultimately fiddly 18xx spinoff. I expect the mark to improve over time. I recommend using blue-painted matchsticks over marking the board as this is a lot easier to handle. There are production issues, particularly that the board is too small and/or the possession counters are too big. I also feel that the game would have been better if each player were given a smaller number of control markers.

Buy Eridu, run a southern country for a few turns, make it buy Eridu, then sack it, and never be a king again.  Simple market manipulations and clever investment across diverse mountain ranges will surely do well for you in the end....

I think we must have made some mistakes.  I enjoyed myself until like the last turn when things went haywire, where I sold my four mountains and had enough money to buy almost all the open spots on the board for huge profits and a landslide win.  That cannot be correct.  Anyway, really liked the water flow mechanism but how we had to approach the game, it took us a few rounds to figure out, and by th en some of us realized we made very bad errors.

Very heavy, extremely fiddly (can actually only be played decently with someone running a excel spread sheet for the different accounts) and a lot of rules to remember. Area pricing mechanism is rather unintuitive and area prices can easily be brought down (selling lowers the price, but buying land does not increase the price). For my taste, the emphasis on area treading is too strong in comparison to irrigation.

This game seems to have much depth as 1830, but you can draw the tracks on the board.. so you don't have to remember anything about the track counter mix.

--May2013-- A lovely weird take on the 18xx thing.  Everything is turned slightly on its ear - and, partly as a result, my fledgling 18xx intuitions steered me wrong as much as right.  It was still quite glorious fun; I'd be delighted to play again.

A good game but not quite great.  Play time can drag out to marathon levels.  The game also seems to revolve around whoever gets the progenitor at the right time and makes the move North at the right time.  The three player game seemed broken, as I easily cruised to victory by starting in the FAR NORTH, and cutting water to the southerners almost immediately.  Babylon was dried up in 3 or 4 turns.

I think it may be broken in the since that whoever gets the most mountains... No matter what happens in the erlay game wins.

Postion yourself to be the first buyer in about round three or four and then buy lots of mountain hexes.  The eraly hexes get over sold and never recover where the mountain hexes never get sold so stay more valuable longer.

RATING: N/A
Wow, that was intense.  Since the shares you buy have a physical position in space and the shares go up and down in price based on the type of terrain in the hex and not the company (ie, the 10, or 11 shares in a company may have 3 different prices) it's pretty tripy.  I liked that the "train" cards could be used for several different things, making the train buying quite lumpy.  However you definitely have to shift gears because despite having to own a "train" and being required to "help buy it" the trains are not tied to income directly (I ended up with an infinite train in a company that couldn't afford to lay the other money making pieces and therefore paid dividends of zero.  However the shares in that company still raised in value because they are not tied directly to that company.)

Verdict: Jury is out. definitely need to play again. preferably sooner rather than later, but may never play again. 2011/09/11

Interesting game concept. But after a few plays it seems like it is much too easy for players to build big reservoirs and pumps near the beginnings of the rivers, suck them dry early in the game, and win. The rules are also quite complicated what with the way there are different special conditions for all sorts of activities and the way owning land determines ownership of kingdoms but is also like owning stock in that terrain type. It's difficult to avoid mistakes in play or to develop coherent strategies.

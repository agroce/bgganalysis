This game lasts longer than we would like without any change in the decisions or actions you can take. 

It lacks real tension.

This is a well-themed dice rolling adventure game. There is no movement optimizing or puzzle solving here. This game is more what I expected out of Tales of the Arabian Nights (I find Tales to be a terrible game). Escape provides some clever story moments and, importantly, has a game behind the story points. The creatures you encounter are varied, and the adventure deck adds flavor and more unknown effects. The time castaways are the key to Escape's entertainment. (Uh oh, we better get Abraham Lincoln back through the paradox before future history is changed.) It should be noted that some play sessions provide more story than others, due to dice rolls. Additionally, some of the entertainment comes from meeting new castaways and finding out how they modeled the stats and abilities in view of the real-life counterpart, so some of the fun will disappear if you play the game a lot. 

The skill checks are functional and, with the exploding dice, both frustrating and fun (which is the point). I do wish they included two sets of different color dice. Some checks can have you initially rolling around 15 or so dice in total before including any additional dice for exploding 6s. It'd be nice to not have to worry about mixing up the dice for the opposing sides, especially since the game takes up so much table space. I have extra dice sets that I use when I play this game.

Additionally, the characters only lightly reflect the adventure they went through via the equipment they gain as the game progresses. Typically, having additional gear simply makes it easier to pass skill checks or safely drive off creatures. This results in the exploring of the board only becoming easier as the game progresses; it does not feel like your character becomes a skilled, but scarred, adventurer. This is the main omission as compared to Tales of the Arabian Nights. In Tales, the changes your character goes through, and how that changes what your character can or can't do, drives the entertainment (oh look, I'm a gender-reversed imprisoned donkey). Maybe this would have been improved if, in Escape, the adventure deck more commonly provided permanent or persistent effects. Though its possible, aside from quicksand, I haven't seen the ones that do. Some of this is somewhat fixed at higher play counts, as the equipment is better distributed over the larger number of characters. At one or two players, each character gets too much equipment. 

Final points of note. The game's play time doesn't increase much at increased play counts. You'll need a similar number of total turns in a 5 player game as a solo game. The length of the game is more due to the difficulty you are currently playing. Also, the rule book was clearly a terrible rush job. For example, it doesn't even describe creature/castaway movement correctly. 

At its best, Escape provides a fun story comprised of historical characters, sci-fi technology, dinosaur bites, a changing time line and heavy handfuls of dice. At its worst, Escape provides an overlong tile flipping exercise that never ramps up to tell a worthwhile story. From my plays, the better is more likely to be present in any particular session. For those highs, this gets a bump from a 6 or 6.5 to a 7.

RATING: 8
The perfect combination of genre elements for my family to enjoy! Dice chucking, whimsical pulpy adventure, co-operative but not grueling. 

I appreciate how quickly the AI turn resolves . The game feels pretty forgiving, but things can definitely spiral into danger with a bad stroke of luck, which helps keep some tension throughout.

It is entertaining for the first 2-3 games, but then begins to feel repetitive.  Increasing the difficulty doesn't really help because it just makes the randomness in the game feel all the more capricious.  It's fine, but I would rather play other co-op games than this one.

The positive
This coop adventure makes me feel like I am exploring and rescuing characters.   The equipment really fleshed out your persona.  Turns move quickly.  The enemy cards have a handful of fun tense mechanics, not so many that it overwhelms.  After a few rounds you will only need to look up the odd rule.  Fast combat with a few nice choices.

The negative
Seemed to start a little slow
Hunting for the tiles with the parts you need gets tedious.  This makes the game too long.  You have to explore almost every spot on the board
Graphic design is functional and so 1994
Map tile pieces are bland and same-y. (I like the actual art pices)

This is a family game that harkens back to some of the classics out there.  It is co-op and you are trying to uncovers ome time machine parts and transport them back to the time machine which is periously sitting atop the volcano rim.  All dinosaurs are scary, even the vegetarians.  And don't leave too much modern day stuff around because you might just cause the future to be crazy.  I enjoyed the "return the out-of time travelers" part of the game and it was cool to escort JFK back to his portal.  A fun theme, easy to learn, and challenging to win...all at the same time.

A fun and thematic cooperative game. The mechanisms in the game are all tried and true but what really makes it shine is the theme. Every action makes thematic sense and I love all the pop-culture references.

RATING: 5
I enjoy the stories that this game eventually tells, but it tells them behind a very bare-bones, aimless, decision-less, though satisfyingly dice heavy framework (I admittedly love exploding dice) presented with a hodgepodge of good art and drab "Adobe Illustrator for Dummies" graphic design that seems to be the signature funk of IDW Games (c.f. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles).

There are moments of drama that punctuate the boredom but this is an adventure package that is aimed at a very specific, Talisman-leaning audience that is down for 2+ hours of either laughing at luck driven events, or falling asleep waiting for your turn. Neither myself nor the rest of the people I play with seem to be in this target audience, so it's specific to the point of irrelevance for me.

Also, the graphic design really does no favors to this game. After slogging our way to victory, the map just looked like an abstract pile of prototype icons and... logs. Lots of logs. 

In the context of other adventure systems that I'm enjoying much more, albeit mostly solo, I see no reason to keep this one. Runebound does this better. Gloom of Kilforth does this better. And zany, eclectic characters from different historical periods just make me want to play Duel of Ages 2 instead (or watch Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure in roughly the same amount of time). Dinosaurs? Don't care. Maybe that's my problem, Barnes. I just don't care about the dinosaurs.

A really good thematic game with some witty references and a keen attention to detail. Though the board art is plain it is both clear and functional. The card art, which is varied and plentiful, is very well drawn and adds a lot of thematic spice to the game.

The mechanisms are involved and random enough to possibly provide a good amount of replayability, and there are always meaningful options to choose from round to round.

A hidden gem I was glad to dig up sooner rather than later.

Wow! This one came out of the blue. I have acquired a ton of new games (slight exaggeration) Sword and Sorcery, Mansions of Madness, Zombicide Black Plague, Runebound 3rd edition with Unbreakable Bonds, all excellent games but this is the one I'm always wanting to play.
If you're a sucker for dinosaurs, you'll love this game. If you like dice based combat, you'll love this game. If you love exploring the unknown, you'll love this game. If you like adventure, this is the game for you.
It is a cross between Avalon Hill's "Dinosaurs of the lost World" and "Dr. Who". The time traveling bit is interesting but the time paradox element is brilliant, I love that you never know who or what will come through a time portal, you have to catch them,  gain their trust and then get them back to their own time all the while, killing, repelling or just plain running from the biggest nastiest creatures that ever roamed the earth. If you kill a dinosaur, you have created a time paradox, leave people or equipment behind, time paradox. In one event I stepped a something squishy, time paradox.
Components are nothing to write home about, the cardboard is thick but mine is warping, even the board. Cards have a nice linen finish but are super thin and there are no dinosaur miniatures. The standees are all the same and "represent" whichever dinosaurs is on the board. The artwork on the cards is fantastic and help with the immersion but really it's the gameplay that does it. The simplicity helps make it fun for all ages and the theme is layered on with a trowel. 
If you have even the slightest active imagination, this game will transport you back in time, try not to stay to long or you may wipe out the earth.

What a bunch of fun! Love the time travel implementation, love fighting (or fleeing from) the dinosaurs, love the exploration. And love the dice chucking. It's just really fun.

When I told Matt the theme of this game (and that it was designed by Kevin Wilson) he pushed aside the 2p game he'd been reading rules for all day and said, "let's do it!"

This is a lot of weird, dumb, frustrating, and difficult fun. The theme -- you are trapped in the prehistoric era and must clean up as much temporal damage as you can -- is a lot of fun. The Time Castaways are a hoot. Running into dinosaurs is terrifying. There's just a lot of wild and entertaining things happening here.

We got stalled out and let Paradox go up too much, leading to a death spiral. In the end, we failed spectacularly. But we had a good time doing so!

This cooperative adventure game is fun. The theme is outstanding for starters. Easy to learn with moderate challenge. There is a fair amount of luck involved with dice chucking and the various encounters but the variation brought on by the decks and dynamic tiles makes each play different. I particularly enjoy the equipment deck and the "castaways". Historical figures that you have to bring back to their own time. 

It's a great addition to the collection. If you have a group of 2-4 and you're not quite sure what to play, it's an easy one to go back to that won't require digging through massive amounts of rules details to learn or relearn the game, or get everyone else up to speed. Great family game.

Very light adventure game. If you want immersive theme, enjoy throwing dice, total randomness, and don't want to think a lot, it's perfect. It's almost a complete throwback to an earlier, more innocent time in gaming. Definitely a gateway, beer and pretzels style game. Can't really see this being fun for more than a couple plays but I look at it like paying for a movie and enjoying the action. Not every game has to be Kanban (and I hated kanban. Who fantasizes about working in a car factory? Seriously, dude, what kind of dream life do you have? ) One of the only games I have bought on a whim, based on a box cover. Kudos to the designer for going against the trend of modern gaming, which is on a devolving curve of pointless Lacerda style complexity as opposed to actual FUN. My wife also likes it (she prefers games that don't involve an hour of teaching.)

Update after second play: first game we rolled badly, lost. Second game, rolled well, and won. Zero thinking involved. It was fun, but way too random.  As I thought, once we beat the game, all desire to play again vanished, especially as it took almost three hours.

Entertaining game, with decent replay value due to the variable map layout.

This is a fun game with some amusing pop culture references, but it suffers from sometimes being too easy (regardless of the difficulty level) because you can get ahead and stay ahead, then take your time finding what you need. It needs a mechanic to keep the pressure on to make this a great game. For what it is, it's a lot of fun to put your brain on the shelf, roll some dice, and have a small chortle at some of the cards.

I adore this game.   It's richly thematic.  Its gameplay is, while a bit fidgety, nuanced  in a manner that makes the game feel complex without being overly thinky.   In fact, while the rules can seem a little fidgety, it is a good kind of fidgety where everything focuses on the theme of the game.

The best part is that it is a cooperative game where you feel the fate of the future is in your hands. Each choice you make has an effect on the overall game play and is tied into a cohesive story.  We laugh as we play.  It's fun.

Escape from 100 Million B.C. is a game of exploration and adventure. If you are looking for a game where you can make careful plans and decisions, this is not the game for you. When I put this game on the table, I explain to my players that random things, both good and bad, will happen to them.

Fortunately for me, I love randomness in my games. Exploring the world that this game provides is dangerous and exciting. One turn, you will stumble across a new piece of equipment or a crucial time machine part, and you will feel like you can take on the world. The next turn, you will cross into a swamp and a t-rex will come take a chunk out of you. Meanwhile, you have a pack of raptors wandering dangerously close to a confused and disoriented Teddy Roosevelt who just wants to get back to his time so he can go back to building the Panama Canal or whatever.  It is absolutely bonkers.

So, if you like randomness and adventure in your games, pick this one up.

Succeeds at making me care about a cooperative game by not dwelling too much on the usual crap. There are decisions to be made, though they're a definite second fiddle to the process of adventuring. Meeting people, rolling dice, laughing at how badly things are going — these are the focuses of this excellent title by Kevin Wilson. Won't be for everyone, but it's for me.

A mechanically solid Ameritrash romp, if a little too transparently mechanical. Kevin Wilson absolutely understands what makes combat, exploration, and skill checks fun. Exploding dice are always a blast. I would have liked more story though, as what little there is is restricted to the castaway cards and the ending blurb. This game is perpetually on sale and it's definitely worth the prices I've seen it for.

A game abounding in silly cleverness, but the rulebook needs work (FAQ [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/157426/escape-100-million-bc-faq]here[/url]) and the adventure card font is almost unreadable.

Well worth the $20 clearance price.  Too bad it didn't sell better originally.

Tips:

- 100 Million is from the [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/10547/betrayal-house-hill]Betrayal[/url] school of design: Tiles are flipped, random stuff happens, and dice are rolled.  Sometimes multiple times in succession.  If you have a group of like-minded adults who appreciate that mode of gaming, you'll have a good time.

- The game works best with 3-4 players. Too much downtime with 5-6.

Thanks to the title ("Escape From...") and logo design, everyone [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1908720/psa-100-million-isnt-escape-realtimesoundtrack-ser]mistakenly assumes[/url] that 100 Million is the latest release in Queen's [i]Escape[/i] realtime/soundtrack series.

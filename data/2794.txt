A dexterity game. Not as 'pure' as crokinole, but good fun nonetheless.

Great game. tough to explain, plays well. Players quickly learn just the right level of control. Very satisfying when you score. First few games take forever as your skills develop.

Too much waiting on the other person. Never seemed like a good idea to take a blocker instead of the points. Blockers seem to have equal chance of helping and hurting you.

Fun dexterity game (if you like the genre), but the size of the game is unwieldy... and it's obviously expensive.  Much skill/practice is needed to get good at the game.  I'm content to play occasionally at conventions and to be mostly pathetic at spinballing.

Fun dexterity game with a really neat gimmick.  Not sure how well it would hold up over time, but since I'm not likely to ever own one, it's not a big problem.

Really interesting dex game.  Sadly out of print and super expensive.  I won't be buying this one, but will happily play it when given the chance.

To be honest I didn't care for this one much, as the learning curve is too steep. Most of these dexterity games, you can see play reasonably competantly out of the box and can yourself improving; for me anyway, this was just too hard to get to the point where you felt like you knew what you were doing.

Played on a homemade version.  I recommend taking on the task of reproducing your own version.  I am so glad I did.  I can see this game being a hit with my family for a very long time.

Tabletop game of spin versus momentum.  Very fun.

I&#039;m rating a &quot;7&quot; here in comments, but not officially in the ranking, since it&#039;s based on a home-made board. I&#039;ve never played on a real board, so it wouldn&#039;t be fair to officially rate it. Fun dexterity game.

RATING: 6
A strange and nifty dexterity game in which you must spin a ball in such a way that it goes past a barrier and then spins backwards into the goal. Pretty neat, but not something you would play often or for long.

RATING: 8
A fantastic dexterity game. Once you get the shots figured out, your opponent can forgo a point and add a cylinder to block your shot. I wish this one were available somehow.

I was so happy to be able to acquire a copy of this game that languished on my want list for years. This is such a unique game that is at heart very simple. The only thing holding it back is that it takes some effort to set up. This has the distinction of being the 1999th game I've rated here at BGG.

Excellent game.  Easily the best new 2-player manual dexterity game in ages.

Just spin-shoot the ping-pong ball into your opponent's half of the board, put enough spin on it to make it bump and roll into their hole/goal.  That's easier said than done.  What a hoot!  One of my all-time top dexterity games.

This game takes skillz.  The goal is basically to shoot the ball into a hole, behind a wall, using only backspin and without going off the opposite side of the board.  Its really too bad that the designer stopped making copies, I hope that it one day becomes available!  If not I'll have to break down and make a set...

Have plans drawn up, have wood, have power saws.  Just need a MN board buddy on a Saturday.  PM me and we can make two copies if you have worked a table saw (I have, I just want someone else who has used one before also and I don't have to train).

Object: get the ball into the whole on the other side of the table.   You'll need to hit the ball to the side of the divider that's in the middle of the table and then spin it back into the hole to score.  You hope to get the hang of it before your opponent scores and decides to place a blocker in lieu of taking a point.

I never grokked this until I played it at BGG.Con 2007. Enthralling and tricky.

Next time, perhaps I'll have rules... but it didn't stop Friedemann Friese from making some suggestions while observing a game at 7 AM Sunday morning. What fun!

It took about two shots for me to realize this was an awesome game.  While the novelty of it is counter to it's size and the difficulty of storing it, I still have plans to own it or make my own.  Someday, I will have my large basement game room with pool table, gaming table, shuffleboard table and this...   a custom made Spinball Table...   I picture mine with a faux painted wood flooring like a basketball court with graphics to match...  not only on the court, but on the sides and also the center divider...   can't wait!

Played at BGG.con '06. I like to see this kind of thing for the novelty factor, but I wouldn't actually play it much. It might make a nice substitute for Beer Pong.

Has to be played to be believed.  Lots of &quot;ooohs&quot;, &quot;aaahs&quot;, and &quot;no WAYS&quot; after some of the shots.  Replayability may be a factor, but not yet for me!

It's neat, certainly.  Amusing for a little while, but for the cost and room that it takes up it just doesn't justify the actual time I'd spend playing it.  Perfect to play fifteen minutes of once every year or so at a convention.

Are they all this ugly?

Damn, Spinball is neat.  I would love to get a set of plans to build my own.

The rules are pretty easy: alternate turns, each player using the rubber-eraser-doohickie to spin the ping pong ball from its launching device (on your edge of the table) across the midpoint of the table and into the target hole. If you make it, either score 1VP or place a piece of copper pipe somewhere on your side (a blocker). As long as the ball misses and spins back to you, you may shoot again -- up to a maximum of 5 tries. The first player to collect 5VP win!

It's a neat, tricky little game! I did OK, at least for a first play, but Chris won our game. Not a bad diversion, but not as much fun for me as other dexterity games (esp. Crokinole).

This is the best table-top skill game out there, bar none. What a shame that no game company ever decided to take a chance with this one.

Home-made game. Lots of fun, addicting sort of game. Definitely the players must be of equal playing ability or it will be a rout. There appears to be ways of handicapping though.

Spinball was the most frustrating dexterity game I tried at BGG.CON. It had looked like fun and was high on my list of games to try at the convention, but in practice it was extremely difficult. You try to spin a ping-pong ball around a barrier and into your opponent’s goal, but it requires an extremely high level of precision to be successful. Moreover, when your opponent succeeds, they get to place blockers on the board to make your task even more difficult. It’s hopeless after a while and even with countless repeated attempts, I just couldn’t get the hang of it. At least Piratenbillard and WeyKick were fun while being difficult, Spinball was not.

Great fun to watch.  Not as much fun to play, at least not for points.  I could enjoy it as much just spinning the ping pong balls.

I don't know how it would hold up to multiple plays, but after just one play it's more fun than it has any right to be.  The fun factor is multiplied by the cool physics needed to get the ball into the hole.  It's just fun to play.

This is a most unusual, but very cool, quick dexterity game.  You must perform a massé to get a ping pong ball into your hole on the other side of a wall.  This is actually quite simple, given the strange silicone brush/finger you use to - well - do a massé-style launch of the ball from your yoke.  I'm apparently a ridiculous natural at this, so I think my enjoyment would be higher against another natural; however, it's still singular and very cool.

After 1 Play: This was fun to play around with, but I like dexterity game to have more of a strategy element, and be less reliant on pure skill.

Pretty fun game, but it plays so quick it almost isn't worth setting up the board.  A lot of the game strategy is "just slow down your neighbors" as opposed to "try and win", which I don't care for.

An excellent mix of strategy and tactics: sometimes your strategy just can't be acted upon and you're forced to play tactically! It has that typical Brand characteristic: "Whatever I do this turn, it will somehow benefit someone else." I love that about Brand games. I also love how (in Guatemala Cafe) the scoring track acts as a timer: yet another element to keep one's eye on!

Criticisms about Guatemala Cafe? Two of them: the rulebook is quite unclear at times, and I think it's a translation problem. Secondly (and this is an odd one, since it's a pretty abstract game), I wish the game had a different theme, like tea plantations! I just have no interest in coffee.

I think it's now safe for me to say the Brands are my favourite designers: I have yet to play a Brand game I have not loved.

I'll throw it out there that I had a MONSTER headache during my only play of this game, but despite optimism based on the bright physical design the whole group with which I played found this one pretty flat.  Sort of a Goa board for actions and resources, and what I found to be a barely interesting shared play board.  There is development and corralling, but I actually find it more interesting in the few minutes it takes place in Fjords.  Our game was ended with a kingmake as another player was sufficiently tired of playing and understandably saw no way to improve their position.  Willing to revisit by request, but not out of interest.

RATING: 6.5
There are some elements of this game that are rather clunky - not fiddly, but definitely clunky.  The dual game boards for starters makes sense, but one is left thinking there must have been some alternative to the ship.  The end result of the game is that much of it feels impeding and omnipresent which clashes against the lighter nature of the game.  Is it a super filler?  Not likely.  Is it a heavy-weight? No, but it will look and perhaps try to act as such.

And while it has no bearing at all on the game play, you should really place a small bag (a ziplock will do) with real coffee beans in the game box.  Something about the game smelling like real coffee is just right.

Another nominee for worst rulebook ever. Well, that title goes to Neuland, but Guatemala Cafe would be a close runner up.
There's one board for the production, with a pseudo-rondel commonal to all players, and another board for plantation. The mechanics are quite interesting, even if they're definitely abstract, and almost exclusively tactical. The blockade mechanic is tricky: eliminates the scoring (except for small amounts) from the first part of the game, and could lead to kingmaking in the end game.
The inaugural cruise was not memorable (the reading of the terrible rules booklet together with the fiddly setup didn't help...): though I would like to retry it to find if the game has some merits, I don't know if I ever will...

Rated after 2 plays; I like the buyer mechanism (not having played Kupferkessel & Co.) and the ever-shortening scoretrack. The English rulebook is poor, though and unclear on a few points, e.g. road placement in the 2-player game (can you place on the edge of the board?)

With half-a-dozen plays under my belt, I like this game more and more. You have to balance building your plantations with restricting your opponents' and getting the pieces you need with denying your opponents the same. Nice production with loads of wooden bits; shame the ownership tiles and the pieces colours don't quite match.

Fun and lighter than it looks. This is one of those games that starts slowly then rushes to a finish. Hints of Carcassonne and perhaps of Masons. The key seems to be a mix of forcing the colours you are strong in and careful guarding of your coffee bags - allowing your opponents to score small but keeping them in reserve for the times when he may score big.

I like the game, though it is perhaps a little too light for my taste, but it doesn't hang around, the play time is under an hour, so it should see plenty of action.

An abstract game with many options on any given turn.  There are some tense moments on the production board because you can only move the buyer figure 1-3 spaces (4 if you pay) on a given turn.  It has a novel scoring mechanic whereby the total points needed to end the game drops by 1 (from 50) for every scoring round that the players initiate.

My rating is lower because I'm not a big fan of abstracts.

RATING: 6.5
Rating based on one 4-player game.  Outcome seemed to depend in large part on distribution of secret coffee bags at the beginning of the game -- those that got several of one color had a big advantage and could control scoring more effectively.  Not a terrible game, but I won without feeling like I had made many meaningful decisions.

A very unique game that is not comparable to anything else. Very nice components. The boards are attractive and lots of good wood. The brown sticker not matching colour was inexcusable. Some problems with turn order. The 4th player was at a disadvantage that was not compensated by scaling. Some king making at the end too. The endgame was ultimately a letdown of the whole buildup of the game. 

It is an okay game that I may want to play on the odd occasion.

RATING: 6
Eh. It's OK. It's another pretty abstract, clever-mechanism German game, but we've moved past the point where that impresses very much. Games with clever mechanics are now a dime a dozen, and this game fails to deliver the something extra to get it noticed in the mass of available game today - there is only minimal theme, and little elegance or artistry in the design. On the other hand, Guatemala Cafe works, which is good news for a game from Eggert-Spiele, as functionality is not something they've been able to reliably deliver in the past. I modestly enjoyed my one play, but the gameplay is probably too constrained to engage the mind, while the theme is far too weak to engage the heart. Replayability is therefore extremely suspect; 10 years ago, we might have liked this game, but this sort of thing has just been done so well so many times by now, time has left this behind. Definitely not a buy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Pretty decent game that's really unlike anything I've played before.  Very tactical in that you're fairly limited in your choices each turn, so you have to do the best with whatever your current game situation is.  But also fairly strategic in that you can pick what you want to focus on throughout the game and try to roll with it.  Only thing that nags me a bit is that sometimes there pretty much no good options on your turn, which is a little frustrating.

Buy stuff and build it on the plantation board then connect you coffee plants to the harbours to multiply your plants when they score. 1 Play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
At least as a two player game, it feels a bit repetitive. Build near the top because it's cheaper. Build in the colours where you have sac superiority. Try not to leave the buyer where the opponent wants it. Save your blocking sacs for the end game. Score your bad colours early. Especially if they are the colours the opponent is building in (one or two points won't make the difference). Block your opponent in if possible. Let your opponent do the heavy lifting for the roads. Nothing to do? Put a boat into the harbour, the neutral colours are better than leaving an empty slot for your opponent to fill with one of their boats. Fill the buyer board with your sac colours.

Some games can have this predefined strategy (like Go) and work due to the depth of possibilities of implementation. This is not one of those games.

RATING: 4
A friendly and nice game built around what I think is a good central idea (area control always creates good tension, I find), hampered by a horrible scoring ruleset. That is Guatemala Café.

The core game really is kinda cute. A pawn walks around a board containing lots of goodies you need to develop coffee plantations: a warehouse, workers, ships, and as the game develops, roads. You are allowed to pick up three items in the pawn's line of sight, and then have to build them on a plantation board according to a few simple rules which would be immediately recognisable if you've ever played Through the Desert or Reef Encounter. Their 'construction' is not for free, and the amount you pay depends on their proximity to the harbours. The closer you are to those, the more expensive it gets. You may also want to put down roads from your plantations leading up to the docks as this increases the point value of your plantation—in other words, it's a Good Thing™ to have them. Now we come to the scoring. Instead of picking up plantation utensils, you can also pick up a coffee sack. You get a fixed amount of cash straight up, and then points based on the size of the plantation and the amount of ships it is connected to. More ships is better. [i]But[/i]... other players are allowed to block you (or anyone else with a plantation in the matching colour, for that matter) from scoring by giving up one of their own sacks in that colour. Either way, the sack is put on the end of the scoring track, and play resumes. The game ends when a scoring marker reaches the (by then large) colletion of sacks put on the scoring track.

The general idea really is not that bad, and its execution in big boards and nicely shaped wooden pieces is charming. But that scoring... Yuck, yuck, yuck. If someone scores more than a handful of points, he'll be blocked by another player. And this petty blocking continues until the other players cannot block him anymore. The result: scoring is non-existent for the first 4/5ths of the game, and then it happens all the time until someone hits the finish line. A very unsatisfying way to play this game, in any case. I notice that there is something of an 'original variant' which would have sacks appear randomly on the board: I don't think this is particularly effective as this is too luck-ridden. Probably the most ideal way to play this game is to have every player given a random sample of sacks as is now the case, but to replace a taken sack with one of their own. This allows for some greater control over what you do, and might bring this game back from the levels of mediocrity. If it works the way I imagine it does, the rating would be improved by two full points or so.

Truly a shame that out of the box this game has such a shitty ruleset.

The placement mechanism reminds me a bit of New England and Oasis, and the movement of the overseer feels tactically similar to Pueblo.  More importantly, the scoring mechanism feels like several Colovini games, particularly Alexandros and Go West, where you choose when to score but all players are scored at the same time.  It's a matter of timing and implied alliances, which I enjoy, but like those other games it can have somewhat of a kingmaker ending.

5 shades of brown, with stickers that are another 5 shades of brown and don't match.   Way oversized boards.  And the gameplay isn't very good either.   It's kind of like Kupferkessel for selecting resources and then building roads down from mountains to the docks.  And it's about coffee.... which some people might get excited about, I guess, but to me that's just boring.

Played once.  Some innovative mechanics here -- I like the way pieces come into the game from the separate board, the fact that the only way to get more money is to initiate a scoring, and each player is forced to take an interest in multiple colors.  Lots of good wood here, too.  I've heard bad things about the "blocking rules", which I haven't played with yet -- we ignored them in our game.

Modestly fun and clever design. As for the theme, it is light but you can still make a good case for it. But bottom line, GC is a perfect information game with no randomness.

A poorly written rules set hides an interesting placement game. It is worth struggling with the rules and get this one on the table, it turns out surprisingly close and pushy. We had a run away winner, but that was more through poor decisions early on, which shows the game has some hidden depth. Recommended and quick when you finally work out what is actually happening.

RATING: 5.9
I was fearful this game was similar to Savannah Café (even though the publishers & designers are different) which I played for the first time yesterday, and in which I was greatly disappointed--it was unexpectedly a child's game and I was concerned this game would also be on a simplistic level. However, this is a completely different game with no similarities whatsoever. 

I enjoy area control and resource management which is what this game is. 

The many components are nice wood ones, and the two, two-sided boards are attractive. One side offers a 2-player variation and another board's side offers a game set-up with "less luck"--we played both these alternate sides. I am a little disappointed that the coffee sacks have stick on color labels instead of being painted, and the boards are tri-folds which do not lay completely flat. Still I think this game has a lot of value packed into it.

The "less luck" setup was fiddly--the random setup would be faster. The setup rules do not exactly match the contents: there was no sack, so we used the box. There are no coffee beans either, which we were instructed not to eat. (By the way, the game does not use coffee beans--I don't even know where they would be substituted.) The rules sadly lack graphic examples. 

Scoring is interesting and adds a lot to the game. When a player runs out of money the only way to get more is to initiate scoring which might benefit their opponent more than themselves. Furthermore scoring can be blocked by other players. 

The game can appear "broken" if the blockade is abused and stalls the game. To counteract this maybe a limit of blockades per player can be imposed. Also a problem can be run away leaders no one can possibly catch--so, there isn't really a fix--players must just try to interfere with another's plantation growth as much as building their own. 

Even though there is a special side for a two player game, I felt a lot of the scoring actions were predictable and that a 3-4 player game would be more strategic and challenging especially when scoring is initiated.

I am not interested in playing it again as a 2-player game, but do want this on the table soon with 3-4 players.

RATING: 5
The two separate boards, the permanent conflict between expanding and scoring, the rather brutal landgrabs on the plantation boards; the game has lots of likable elements.

In the end, however, the scoring, while certainly interesting, seems too much of a crapshoot, and the winner is determined by the group as a whole at least as much as by what you did. The simple most important factor is what coffee sacks you draw. They define what colours can be scored, and they tell you the scoring of which colours you can prevent. And when people are able to blockade "your" colours for longer than someone else's, you lose.

Good material: 2 doublesided boards (goods display: one fixed setup and one random. Map: one for two player and the other side for 3-4 players). This is exemplary. Intersting mix of mechanics but despite the coffee theme rather an abstract. It plays smoothly and creates turn angst. Even though there are no dice or cards you always feel that you had bad luck when it's your turn because you rarely ever get what you need (but this concerns all players). You really have to watch what your fellow players do for not offering them good opportunities. It's a bit sad this this game is such prone to kingmaking. Furthermore some colors are sometime (artificial light) not that easy to distinguish. Blocking rule causes end game problems and feels kinda flawed.(Rating after three  plays)

Once you get past the badly written/organized rules, there is a good game in there.  A paragraph laying out the Turn Sequence and options available would have helped.

There are labels to apply (35), but this is fairly fast, especially if you've done this for several hours with games such as [gameid=14015] and/or [gameid=87].

Play is fairly straightforward, and blocking other players is possible (on the Plantation board).  Apart from that, there is not much player interaction.  The player to your right may be able to limit your options depending on how he/she moves the "Buyer" piece (on the Production/Purchase board).

If using the blockading rules for scoring, the game may appear pointless as it is possible that no points get scored until three quarters of the game has been played.  Yet, blockading is not that bad of a rule once you've played the game a few times.

Maga a játék két táblán játszódik. A játéktáblára helyezzük fel az 5 fajta kávéhoz tartozó munkásokat, hajókat, raktárakat. Ennek két oldala van, az egyik oldalán előre meg van határozva, hogy hová tesszük ezeket a munkásokat, hajókat, raktárakat, a másikon nincs meghatározva, ott tetszőlegesen helyezhetjük le őket. A másik tábla az ültetvénytábla, ahol majd a játéktábláról megszerzett munkásokat, raktárokat, hajókat rakjuk le. 
A játék elején a játéktáblára felhelyezünk kávészsákokat, illetve a játékosoknak is kiosztunk több kávészsákot. Egy vevő figurát teszünk fel a játéktáblára, amellyel a soron következő játékos 1-3 lépést léphet ingyen, a tábla szélén körbe haladva, vagy 2 centavosért (guatemalai váltópénz) még egyet léphet. Ahol megáll, abban a sorban illetve oszlopban hajthat végre akciót:
1.	Elvehet az adott sorból vagy oszlopból 1-3 munkást, hajót, raktárt. Ezeket rögtön le is kell tenni az ültetvénytáblára. A lehelyezés ára attól függ, hogy a raktárak és a munkások milyen messze kerülnek a kikötőtől. 

Ha elveszünk egy figurát, akkor annak a helyét egy utat jelző fadarabbal kell feltölteni. Ha az adott sorban vagy oszlopban van ilyen út, akkor azokból is vehetünk el, de ezek száma is beletartozik a megengedett 1-3 darabba. Az utak lehelyezése ingyenes, céljuk pedig, hogy a raktárunkat összekössék a kikötővel, aminek a pontozásnál lesz jelentősége. 

2.	A másik lehetőség, hogy egy adott kávéfajtát kiértékelünk. Azt a kávét tudjuk kiértékelni, amelyikből van egy zsák az adott oszlopban vagy sorban. A kiértékelést indító játékos kap 8 centavost, majd az adott színből raktárral rendelkező játékosok annyi pontot kapnak, ahány munkás dolgozik a raktáruk mellett. Ha a raktár egy úttal össze van kötve a kikötővel és a kikötőben horgonyozik egy ugyanolyan színű hajó, akkor a pontok száma megduplázódik, két ilyen színű hajónál háromszorozódik, három ilyen színű hajónál megnégyszereződik a kapott pontok száma. Minden esetben a pontozás után egy ilyen színű hajó a kikötőből kikerül a játékból. 


A pontozással kapcsolatban van két érdekes dolog. Egyrészt a pontozáshoz szükséges zsákot fel kell helyezni a pontozó sávra az 50-es számtól kezdve visszafelé, és az értékelést kérő játékos helyez fel helyette egy zsákot a saját készletéből. Ennek az az értelme, hogy a játék addig tart, míg az egyik játékos bábuja el nem éri, vagy meg nem haladja az egyik ilyen lehelyezett kávészsákot. Ennek következtében mindig máskor lesz a játéknak vége, hiszen előfordulnak értékelések, amikor nem is kapunk pontot, csak az állandó pénzhiány leküzdése érdekében kezdeményezünk értékelést. Máskor meg előfordulhat, hogy többszörözött pontokat kapunk. 
Ez utóbbival kapcsolatban van a másik érdekesség, a blokád. Amikor értékelésre kerül a sor, a játékostársak megvétózhatják a pontozást. Ezt akkor érdemes megtenni, ha valaki sok pontot kapna. Az értékelést kérő megkapja a 8 cantevost, de pontozásra nem kerül sor, hanem helyette abból a sorból vagy oszlopból építkezhet. 
Amikor az ember kinyitja a dobozt, egyből szembetűnik, hogy mennyire telezsúfolták a dobozt fa alkatrészekkel, hatalmas kávészsákokkal, munkásfigurákkal. A raktárak és a hajók is teljesen kidolgozottak, még a körbe-körbe szaladgáló vevő figurája is hatalmas. A játéktáblák is nagyméretűek és ráadásul valódi kávészemeket is adtak a játékhoz, egy kicsit növelve a játék háttértörténetét jelentő kávétermelés illúzióját. 
A játékszabály elég rövid és érthető, bár a magyar fordítás számomra egy két helyen nehezen értelmezhető volt, de miután az eredeti szabály is nagyon rövid, így a játék értelmezésével igazi gond nem lehet. 
A játék kulcsa az értékelésekben rejlik. Gyakran pénzszűkében szenvedünk, és csak az értékelésnél tudunk pénzhez jutni, így néha akkor is értékelésre kényszerülünk, amikor nem is kapunk pontot. A pontozás megvétózása kicsit kilóg a harmonikus szabályok közül, hiszen célja a másik akadályozása. 
A Guatemala Cafe a nagy mennyiségű alkatrész ellenére sem bonyolult játék. Könnyű megtanulni, de mégis van mélysége. Figyelni kell a másik ültetvényeire, illetve arra, hogy a vevő melyik sort vagy oszlopot tudja elérni és ott milyen bábuk vannak még. A blokád számomra kicsit kilóg a játékból, nem ad pozitív hatást, hiszen a célja csak a másik akadályozása, így inkább csak a játékot lassítja. Összességében nem egy lenyűgöző alkotás, inkább egy korrektül összerakott darab, amely a komolyabb családi és a könnyebb stratégiai játékok határán van.

UPDATE: On a second play, it seems there is a problem with the game; if you lack the right colors for scoring, you can essentially be locked out from earning any more money and thus from doing anything in the game. Possibly this could be fixed by a simple change of strategy, or by the blockade rule, but it left a bad taste in my mouth.  It can also be really frustrating trying to get the buyer to where you need it to be.

Nifty!  My husband picked this up for free at Origins and we got around to trying it some weeks later.  It's sort of an economic game where players are rewarded financially for scoring and there is a constant balance between setup and reward.  Very short and things can change quickly with the huge scores that are available with ships.  Dynamic and interesting; I look forward to playing again. (3 plays)

After 1 play.

Strange game - during the gameplay everybody scores a few points after a few points.  And in one decisive moment one player jumps forward scoring a lot of points and wins a game.  It seems quite random who gets this favorable position to be able to win the game.  This is especially true when players are similarily experienced.
And you cannot say you work whole game to put yourself into that position - it's just not predictable in a long term.  In addition it's quite random (available pieces in hand) if players will be able to block this decisive scoring of their opponent.

So the winner is designated quite randomly.

After more plays my note might rise up a bit, because I see some potential in the gameplay, but I'm afraid final conclusion (random winner) will be unchanged.
[but anyway I don't feel like playing it even once more].

Oh boy, and I didn't even mentioned a problem of kingmaking...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
initial rating 1 play 4 players

A very unique game that didn't feel like anything else and a well themed one I thought too in which the theme was also well implemented and unique.  

Players are buying things from a market which has been simplified by a movement track. You can move the 'buyer' 1 to 3 spaces on the market board and pay to move one extra space as well. Where this buyer lands dictates what is up for possible sale for the person moving. Your goal is to build some coffee plantations, add workers of the same color to harvest the coffee, build a road down to the docks (which can be shared) where you can ship the coffee away if you have a boat. 

Game-end was a slightly unknown factor, you see as the game progress's the game is getting closer to finishing but it can be hard to pinpoint. Choices aren't too difficult and not a high strategy game but it wins extra points for a one hour play time and very nice bits with nice-looking double sided boards. No real depth but also no AP either on the flip-side.

There is a pretty good dose of luck here and it plays an even bigger role if you allow blocking. Blocking means playing a tile to stop someone from scoring, we played this way and while it adds to the game I think it also adds too much luck/randomness as well and even some kingmaking. I beleive the advanced game plays without blocking and while removing it might help the kingmaking I don't think it will diminish it completely, and though I usually like screwage I need to try the game again without this to see if it improves.

This one comes from Eggert-Spiele, which has had several recent successes (Imperial, Antike, Space Dealer, Neuland).

The rules it turns out are relatively simple, but the English rules it turns out are very hard to parse as all 3 of us had to read and re-read a couple of paragraphs just to figure out the setup (which it turns out is actually quite easy as well). The copy we played also appeared to have a missing bean bag token, but it turns out it didn't affect the play.

The game was interesting, but another play is needed. All three of us essentially played solitaire. We all placed storage sheds on separate paths, so no interference with each other's paths, ships or works. We also didn't compete much for the same type of plantation types, until near the end where it came down to a king maker position for the last place person who was out of money again and since the only way to get money is to also cause a scoring, she had to score one of two plantation types, either one which would have had one of the other two of us win the game.

First off, I need to say that the rules are horrendous.  Would it hurt to have more examples, or at least a full illustration of the board?  Maybe I'm just not that smart, but I had to read the rules several times to figure out how to play.  It seems like eggertspiele often does this - brevity can make it seemingly more easy to learn a game, but examples really help you understand.  Anyway, the game is remarkably abstract.  Half of the game reminds me of Kupferkessel in how the piece moves around the edge of the board, limiting your options.  The other board is more interesting in that it forces cooperation and a little risk-taking.  Ultimately it doesn't seem that there is that much depth to the game, especially for one that initially appears so complex, with two boards and a ton of pieces.  But I could be wrong and would happily try this again.

OK luckless perfect information game with interesting mechanisms. I like the selection of the goods on the trading board and the build-up on the plantation board. Nasty play is possible in the placement of the warehouses and worksters. Try to concentrate on two or three different colors and watch which colors other players are specialising in (opportunistic play to profit from the ships in the color of another player on the same road can be quite rewarding). I don't like the endgame which might result in a kingmaking situation via the blockade of a color.

It ain't easy to honestly judge a game where you got horribly thrashed, and with 3 points to 21, 22 and a winning score of 45, "horribly thrashed" might still be putting it mildly. In this case, it is even harder, because neither I nor the other players could say what, exactly, I had been doing wrong. I suspect it might have to do with my timing in scoring and blockading, but it is hard to say.

Thus, my tentative rating of 7 is a middle ground between the two possible scores that Guatemala Cafe might get with some more plays: either none of us got behind the subtle scoring rules, which would make it an original and deep 9, or similar thrashings continue to happen with no discernable rhyme or reason, which would make it an original and overly fragile 5. Either way, I'm quite eager to find out, and that's more than I can say about most games that are so unaccommodating in the trial run.

Guatemala Café has a shared rondel, nearly perfect information, scoring vs infrastructure tradeoffs, and competition that centers around leeching and pseudo-collusion. Why on earth does nobody but me like this game?

There are probably a few issues to work out with the blockade rules, and I think the monetary system could be improved, but it's perfectly serviceable as is and has a lot of interesting qualities. It's obtuse and opaque and lovely.

UPDATE: Was a 7.5; gets a 1 point boost to 8.5 from me for being [b]the only game[/b] in the entire[?] hobby that consists [b]of only female characters[/b] doing real-world non-gender-specific things [not being nuns, witches, or objects for men to acquire].

(Guatemala Antigua is probably the best coffee I've ever tasted, but I'm trying not to let that affect my rating. But it did help in selling the game to me.) 

I guess I'm a bit partial to these agricultural building games... Guatemala Cafe reminds me of a number of them, all of which I own and like (Hacienda, Dos Rios, Aquädukt), and while it at first felt like a collection of other games' features, it does have an identity all its own. The rules are simple, but there is actually quite a bit going on, and there seems to be a number of possible strategies to keep your opponents in check while simultaneously advancing your own position. A solid, interesting game and a pleasant surprise, marred only slightly by the shoddy quality of some of the wooden components.

Move around the board Kupferkessel Co. style, but on a much bigger scale, buying factories, workers, ships and roads (across 5 colours) from a single row/column and place them onto a second board, aiming to get factories and workers together, then connecting the factories by roads to ships. The crux of the game is how the scoring happens - if you don't buy anything, you can choose to score the colour that's in that row, and everyone scores that colour = # of workers next to factories * (1 + connected ships). Unless you're playing the blockade rules, which means the colour scores only if everyone says the colour can score. What-the-?!?. Turns are pretty fast - determine which row to buy from, move there, buy and place. If you're out of money, trigger a scoring. That nets you more money automatically, whether or not it actually scores, and so the game zips along. It's important therefore to get on colours that other people are getting on (less opposition to scoring), leach off other players's roads if you can ... and hope you're the beneficiary when the king-making scoring plays actually go through. It plays fine, just feels like strange results will happen each play, with or without the blockade rules, resulting in anti-climactic endings.

Interesting build-and-score game that's really all about timing.  You don't want to focus too much on building for the future, as the game might end before the future happens, but you also want to make sure you build enough to make scoring matter.  The game appears a lot more complicated than it really is, the setup time is too large for a game of its length, and the rulebook is horrendous.

An interesting competitive puzzle game that does not show all it has to offer on a first play. The two boards make for an interesting mixture of 'game modes'. Selecting the best possible move on the available resource matrix and then placing the factories/workers/roads is quite challenging. I found that the game has a tad too many options in the beginning and a and not enough things you can do towards the end of the game. 

I assume it was a first-play mishap but I won more or less through luck, that is, due to which specific bag of beans was still up for grabs to ship.

A second play could increase the rating.

RATING: 6.25
Fun game to play.  The objective is to build a plantation, with workers that connects with a road to a dock with a ship in port.  You score based on number of workers around plantation, more if a road is used and more if a ship the same color of the plantation is in port.  You build all of this by rotating around a resource board and purchasing resources or scoring to collect money.

Mmm! Smell that coffee .... and then play the game.
Interesting game where the scoring track comes back to meet the advancing score markers!
Set up plantations in any/as many of the 5 different colours & try to sell the most coffee, but all plantations of a scoring colour will earn their owners points.
Block scoring if another player is going to do too well from it.
Add a road to ships at the dock to double, treble or quadruple your score.
Great selection tool which ensures that it's not easy to get all the pieces you want in one go. 
Some good opportunities for blocking in this game.
Enjoying it very much so far. Seems to scale very well too.

Neste jogo, cada participante deve criar plantaçoes de 5 tipos de café buscando vende-los para adquirir pontos de vitória. Para tal, devem construir armazéns, colocar trabalhadoras na plantaçao e buscar ligar seus terrenos a navios do porto, através de estradas.
Um jogo com um conceito interessante mas que a aplicaçao da mecanica até o final pode ser frustrante. 
Talvez melhor se jogado em numero par de jogadores (2 ou 4).

--May2007-- It's an interesting design.  It looks like it's seen a good bit of tuning, and as a result it plays very cleanly.  I'd guess it'll play better with 3 than 4; but the 4p experience was good fun.  Hoping to play again soon.
--Jun2007-- Hmm; had a bit of trouble with a kingmaking endgame in second time out: worrying.
--Nov2011-- Tried with 2.  Much much better.  Interesting dynamics; well worth playing.  Amused daughter #1, too - so it's back in rotation.  Rating is specifically for 2:  I think it's less interesting with more.

Gets points for interesting and diverse play mechanics, loses points for shamelessly patterning (if not blatantly taking verbatim rules from) Puerto Rico.  Fun game, though it does seem something is a bit off.  Also gets a knock for the almost unforgivably unintelligible English rules translation.

RATING: 6
The two separate and different game boards is a nice twist that gives the game a certain level of novelty (though one can argue that the boards could easily have been combined into one larger game board). A fairly light game with easy rules, even for non-gamers, as long as you can work your way through a first reading of the horribly written rule book, while still maintaining your sanity.

This game totally failed the first time I played it.  I was convinced that we were playing the blockade rules wrong, and it turns out that they were indeed completely misplayed.  The second time through we really got to see how this system worked.  The rules are pretty abhorant, I wouldn't be surprised if most people aren't playing the blockade rules incorrectly.  Frankly, I think the blockade works well, when played correctly.  I've only played this on the balanced board and I was quite pleased at the result, I'd have to play this quite a bit before I'd give a shot to the other side.

As far as the game goes, I felt that most of this game was as in your face as a Euro gets without direct conflict. There are a number of aggressive moves that you can make on both boards.  I like the drafting board, I think it works well.  Kind of a cross between Kupferkessel and Hansa.  The game is short enough that you are usually given a number of tough decisions to make on this until the end.  I've read people complaining that there wasn't anything available to pull from the draft board, perhaps that comes down to the group dynamic of moving the game along slowly or just painting yourself into a corner.

The other board is all about elbowing your way into good land.  I like the jockeying for position.  Everything feels tight and tense.

Now that said there is a kingmaking issue to the game.  I honestly don't mind it so much as I personally like to play for place.  If I don't see my self making headway past my position, I'll gladly end a game at 2nd than waffle and come in last.  I think you have to accept that before you play this game.

At first glance, this game has great visual appeal and seems like there's going to be some cool economics going on.  Unfortunately, you find yourself trapped into usually just one or two types of coffee and all too often, the Buyer just does not present an interesting choice of what to do.  I felt that my hands were tied most of the game and I was just going through the motions.  Rating is tentative, but a second play will definitely change it (and most likely, for the worse).

I really didn't like the "Not yet you don't score" mechanism.  The importance of matching up your holdings with your scoring bags is essential, but I found this to not be possible because of how it played out.  It's easy to chop someone off, and if it matches your colors, there's not much you can do.

One of those that I want to try again before I forget what I was planning on doing next time.  I might end up liking it more.  There are definitely a lot of actions to consider each turn.  Even when you finally decide on a row  or column to choose from, you still have to decide what you want.  For some reason, it seemed a little dry to me, especially for an economic game, which I usually find intriguing.  Docked a point for colors that are too close to each other but add a point for one of the best box covers I've ever seen, perhaps my favorite cover art.

Pro: 
- The plantation board and mechanism
- The play board
- building and scoring
- Nice bits (big pieces, nicely done)
- There's actual coffee in the game.

Contra:
- The blockade rule kills the game. Without that, I'd give it a solid 7-8.
- The colors of the bits and stickers. Depending on lighting and angle it's hard to distinguish red and brow, resp. brown and black.

Actually rather simple, this one is nevertheless difficult to explain to new players. Even tougher for new players to grasp strategy at first; definitely one of those games where the lights start to go on about halfway through the game. The game itself works very well and does reward planning and stragety, but struck me as a somewhat dry, dull and repetitive affair largely lacking tension and flavor. And really, how hard would it be, even for a small publisher like Eggert-Spiele, to ensure that the colors on the scoring tiles actually conform to the color of the pieces to which they are supposed to correspond? I cut small publishers a lot of slack because they sometimes don't have great graphic design resources, but the mismatching of colors here is a completely unnecessary production flaw.

I lived in Guatemala for over 9 years and have traveled thjere manty times, so am very excited to get my hands on this game.  However, from what I have seen from the art work the authors have not done their homework.  First, they could have used the Guatemalan national currency, Quetzale(s)rather than the non-discript centavo(s).  Secondly and most grieviously the dress depicted on the supposed Guatemlan lady does not even come close to any of the over 25 Mayan trible sect's typical dresss.  Which, oh by the way, about 55% of Guatemalan women still wear today.  It would have taken about 30 minute of research to discover this and to make the artwork more authentic and the game name worthy. I hope the authors have done a better job on the actual game and not taken an easy shortcut as they have done on the artwork.

As I only played one game so far with the random board, take this rating with a grain of salt. I think with further play this is more than a 7.5. 

Here's what I found excellent about the game:
- 2 x 2 boards (double-sided), one variant putting the stress a little more on luck, while the other side of the board makes for a game which more or less eliminates the luck element as far as it goes. This goes to show how much effort and how many thoughts the developers spent on the production of this game.
- The included beans in the bag are a great idea to support the theme. It took me some while to figure out where the coffee smell came from. At first I thought I just imagined it, I smelled at the game material but then there they were in the cloth bag. Very nice!
- The twist to the scoring mechanic in which the longer the game lasts (the more people have activated scoring throughout the game) the less points you need to fulfill the victory condition

Here's what I liked about the game:
- The tense feeling of never having enough money
- The tense feeling of always wanting to do more than you can in one turn (ok, lots of games have that)
- The choice of either purchasing workers, ships, store houses or to score one kind of coffee for victory points and money
- All those parts - Eggert really is Quality gaming, don't nobody dare say something against wooden pieces (0.5 in the rating for components and the neat idea of the coffee beans)
- Mix between cooperation (unvoluntary) and screwing the co-players

Here's what I didn't like about the game:
- It's more strategic and not as light as I expected it to be.Even has some (not much) downtime due to analysis paralysis.
- It's not intuitive. In a first game you are bound to make mistake over mistake before you even realize you screwed up. So this game will rather grow on you, if it gets the chance to. 
- Blocking: While I think the mechanic of blocking your opponents when they want to score is a good idea overall, in this particular endgame it boiled down to who can block whom for how long. With one of your own coffee bags in the color that the active player wants to score, you can block that scoring. Too bad, if you don't have that colour on your hand and others have coffee bags in the colour you urge to score. But then again, I wouldn't know how to improve on that matter for now.

coffee planting and selling in Guatemala. The game uses two boards, representing plantations and markets. Players try to produce different kinds of coffee to ship to Europe. The market overseer decides where and if players can buy roads, huts, workers or ships or if scoring takes place. Category: Farming;  Mechanics: Trading, Commodity Speculation

Almost a gamer's game and better than a run-of-the-mill solid 7, this one allows for nice strategy when using the board with less luck.  Scales well with the 2-player side as well.  There's a lot of wood in the box and so far has my vote for the game with most wood for this year.  It also has the dubious honor of being the 1400th game I've added to my collection here at BGG.

A mechanic I didn't really understood during my first play.

While it is a really pretty game that I wanted to like, it just didn't quite grab me with the first play.  Maybe I didn't quite get the strategy or something.  

After the second play, I like it a lot less.  The game almost seems predetermined from the outset based at least partially on the random coffee distribution.  In our four player game, two players cooperated on black, two on another color.  We couldn't block black scoring, but the could block our scoring a couple of times.  Naturally, they were a distant 1-2.  The whole blocking mechanic seems random and stupid.

The rules for placing legal plantations/workers are similar to New England's placement rules, although there isn't much similarity between the two games beyond that.

It's very possible for a player to run away with the game early on, which means that one player will need to expand into a new color just to prevent the winning player from ending the game prematurely -- even though s/he will be at a disadvantage as a result.

Not bad, not great.  Truthfully, I'm glad that the game is rather short:  45-60 minutes, ideally.

Played once (with 4 players). This game has interesting ideas (I most notably like the way how the chaos on the first board turns into order on the second one), but in my single play so far, I thought it was a bit long and subject to possible king-making. Still, I would play it again to hopefully lift (or unfortunately confirm) these doubts.

RATING: 4.5
Very disappointing. Interesting mix of drafting board and placement board - trying to riff off of Goa - but the game ultimately falls apart halfway through. Fewer resources are available, leading to more "dead" turns with no meaningful decisions. Further, as you near the end, one of X people will be in a position to win the game based on what scores next - meaning several people simply delay the end by trying to not position the selection board where another person can claim victory. A worse end-game kingmaking position/situation than Dos Rios. Further, the components are inconsistent - the shades of brown used on the meeples, the tiles and the coffee bags are not consistent at all -- making it virtually impossible to distinguish some of the types of coffee from each other. Ugh.

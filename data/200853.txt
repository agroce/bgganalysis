Close to Carcassonne in feel, but original style and ideas.  Tile capture works well with limitation of not beimg able to move backwards.  The habitat requirements for the animals was clever and the combination habitats to meet requirements inspirational.  I enjoyed my first game immensely, but admittedly benefited from the other three players largely using the half of the board I wasn't in.  We missed the jump over rule if there are other player's tokens in the way, which I think will make the game flow freer and play even better.  Another Moorsel masterpiece to rank along side Factory Fun and Sun, Sea and Sand.

Vooral mooi spel waarbij je een wildpark bouwt en ervoor zorgt dat je dieren de juiste habitats rondom zich hebben liggen, en dat de toeristen te zien krijgen wat ze leuk vinden.
Redelijk wat geluk toch, functie van de tegels die rondom je komen te liggen en die de tegenstander al dan niet neemt.  Dit maakt het voor mij een spel dat zeer geschikt is voor kinderen, zelfs vanaf 8 jaar.
Enige minpunt (voor mij en mijn 8yo): puntentelling enkel op het einde, waardoor je tussentijds geen enkel idee hebt wie er aan de winnende hand is.

Valt wel tegen met 5 spelers, zeker als het kinderen zijn: te veel downtime, te weinig spanning.

Initial rating, I need to play this more
Easy to explain/play tile laying abstract - but it looks pretty. There's surprising depth here and you do need to look ahead both to what tiles you can take and where you put them (also factoring in the goals you want to score). Pleasantly surprised thought I'd hate it.

RATING: 7
A pretty cool mostly-solo puzzler, with the addition of a tile drafting mechanism that requires you to plan a little more and pay attention to what other players are doing. It adds a little bit of player interaction to what would otherwise be a solitaire exercise, but we found that most of the interaction was more of an accidental type of interaction, where you went after something that it turned out someone else wanted.

I really enjoy these types of puzzle games though, and this is a really nice one!

I probably would have even rated this even higher, but honestly, the lack of nice artwork and graphic design really did take away from the clarity of what's going on, and the overall enjoyment of the game. I wish it had been more professionally done in that regard, but I still think the the game is very nice.

RATING: 7
Beautiful, simple, elegant, and theme-oozing tile layer. I have only good things to say about Cornel's latest number. The walking tile selection mechanism is fun and leads to lookahead fun, and the tile placement spatial reasoning adjacency problem feels wonderfully relaxing and rewarding. There is a substantial luck of the draw element that does not feel foreign, and should not frustrate, since this is a very quick game both to setup and play, where the goal is to have fun shuffling fauna and flora. For experienced gamers, there is very limited depth after a couple of plays, but the game should still continue to be a fun filler for quite some time. 

Habitats is a family game par excellence, and one that should work well with any gaming group and at all player numbers. Recommended.

+ functioning mechanisms, albeit of limited innovation value
+ tile laying animals is just fun
+ easy to teach and play
+ beautiful theme, art and components
+ works with all player ages and counts

= not much strategy involved, this is mostly a tactical game 
= luck of the draw present

- I would have preferred cubes to signify scoring tiles, instead of flipping about
- I would have preferred many more scoring goals, in the form of a card deck

The interactivity of the collection area isn't as high as it first appeared, and when one is near an edge/corner of the collection area one's choices can be less interesting. I find myself wishing some of the tiles provided tokens (food?) which one could use to move an additional space when taking a tile. Also, 5p was too many - I'd have liked the game more with shorter playtime.

This is a tile-laying game where you put tiles in your nature park to score points. Animal tiles score points by being next to the correct types of terrain, special tiles score points by being around animal tiles, certain types of terrain, or just other tiles. Then there are bonus points you can score by making your park a certain shape or having a good mix of terrain.

Picking up tiles is not random but there's a limit to how much you can plan ahead due to opponents blocking you. Even so, there's not really a way to directly screw over other players. Player interaction is indirect. 

It's a fun puzzle-y type game that is pretty chill.  It's cool to look back on your creation and the ceramic animal markers are a nice touch. 

One "house rule": when you place an animal tile, you're supposed to place it upside-down, only rotating it right side up when you successfully complete its requirements. Well it can be hard to rotate a tile without disturbing other tiles around it. So I took a bunch of plastic cube markers I had lying around and used those to mark which animal tiles would score instead.

RATING: 7
A fun tile placement game that feels like the old "Theme Park" games, with a small amount of PvP interaction. Interesting mix of laying tiles to optimise your points, and planning your route around a seperate play area to collect the tiles you need (which is where you can block other players if you are paying attention to their parks). Once you have got your head around the scoring system, it is a fairly peaceful game where you are mainly trying to better yourself and your park design. Made better by the theme, which prevails throughout. Because of this, it works well with 2 players and I couldn't see it being much deeper with more. Would recommend for any couples who love animals and less aggressive board games.

Tile placement with a nice tile choosing mechanic. Each player chooses tiles by moving their animal figure on a grid of tiles. I like the game theme a lot - making a wildlife park without fences. All the animals have their own environmental requirements and it's interesting to try to fulfill them. Biotopes depicted in adjacent animal tiles are also used to fulfill the requirements.

Most of the game components look great, but there are some issues. While I understand that these illustrational choices are made because all tiles need to be distinct, I feel quite odd that a bee and a lion are the same size in illustrations. Also, big flowers look weird for the same reason and grey tiles (watchtowers etc) look just ugly.

In Habitats, each player builds a big wildlife park without cages or fences. The animals in your park need their natural habitats: grassland, bush, rocks or lakes. The zebra needs a big area of grass and some water adjacent, for example, while a bat needs rocks and bush and water, a hart needs bush and grass, and a crocodile needs mainly water. There is a snake, baboon, bee, elephant, otter, lizard, turtle, eagle, meerkat, scorpio, hog, catfish, rhino, etc., each with its own landscape requirements — 68 different animals in total.

Each player starts their individual park with an entrance tile, and they are each represented in the marketplace of animal tiles by a ceramic figure. On a turn, a player takes the tile to their left, right or front; moves their figure to the space just vacated; then draws a tile to place where their figure started the turn.

When adding an animal tile in your park, you add its main landscape — the base space for the animal — to your park, too. While placing this new animal, its own piece of landscape can help to fulfill the requirements of your other animals' requirements, e.g., the water on a hippo tile fulfilling the adjacent otter's need for water. Thus, fulfilling every animal's desire for land becomes a more and more difficult task with each tile you add.

Aside from expanding your park with different landscape types, flora and animals, you can improve its profitability by building extra entrance roads, trek spots, and watchtowers.

Habitats lasts three seasons, with each season giving each player 6-9 new tiles for their parks. Whoever has best met the goal of the season receives bonus points, with a smaller number of points for second and third place. At the end of the game, each player scores for each tile in their park based on whether that tile's requirements are satisfied. Whoever scores the most points wins!

Habitatis is a tile-laying puzzle game about building your own habitat and ensuring that each animal tile is adjacent to the landscape it requires. The rules are simple and scoring for each type of tile is intuitive. This nicely allows players to put all their focus on maximizing placement of tiles. All tiles have a landscape, and when you can place a tile that satisfies two animals in one play is very satisfying. Scoring is up front and builds upon your habitat each round, so players leading will likely remain in the lead. If the table is equally skilled, this is a great challenge game that plays quickly and is easy to learn.

Got a hold of the 2nd edition via kickstarter and I have to say that I really like this one, it takes a couple of goes to get a firm grasp of what is best to do but it's really not a hard game to understand.
There's lots of potential replay value and I can safely say this should be accessible for almost all players.
Much like Carcassonne there's, surprisingly, a tactical aspect especially when building your environments at the early stages of the game, I enjoy that aspect quite a lot.
The method of tile collection is partly down to luck and forward planning but it's really not difficult at all, in theory you should be able to build but you have to be careful with your choices, I've kicked myself a couple of times because of taking a tile at the wrong time or placing it in the wrong place a few turns earlier.

Overall a really good tile laying game, I have no complaints, only compliments.

RATING: 7
Good family game with a simple but efficient acquisition system. You must surround your animals with the terrain types that form their habitat to score them. There are also special tiles (maybe a bit too many) that score in other ways. And special scoring cards for each round, to make each game slightly different. Although not very exciting, the gameplay is fine, allowing a little planning and player interaction. Luck of the draw is a factor, but not too high for this type of game. I'm just not fond of the cutesy breakable animals, and I like it even less that they are random in every box.

Each player is building a tableau of tiles, trying to place tiles next to each other that need the demands of each other. Such as a bee tile might say "wants to be next to two flowers". That could be a flower touching each side of the tile or it could be a group of two flowers touching the tile. Another tile might say "wants to be next to 3 fields" [impala] or another that might say "wants to be next to 1 wasteland and 1 forest" [ant]. 

Picking up and acquiring tiles is very similar to Darjeeling. You have a pawn you move around a bunch of tiles and can only choose the tile directly in front of, or to the side of your pawn. Not behind. If someone is in your way, you pick the tile directly past them.

Happy animals at the end of the game score points, depicted on the tile. There are also a "whoever has best of XX" scorings between rounds. Feels mostly like a solitaire puzzle, though the milestone scoring does have you keeping tabs on other players to see what they are up to. Plays very quickly.

Corne van Moorsel designs very appealing and creative games that often play a bit rough. This means I usually want to like his games more than I do. His last game, Samara, felt disappointingly unfinished. However, Habitats is one of Corne's most polished titles. It still has that creative edge. It still feels, at moments, like the screws are a bit loose. But I suspect riding that edge is what feeds Corne as a designer and it certainly excites me to explore his games.

In Habitats you are laying tiles to build a nature park. There are animal habitats, flowers, tourists, watchtowers and access roads. Each tile scores differently at the game's end. Tourists will reward you for either having a large land area of a specific type, or many land areas. Watch towers reward you for having completed habitats or flowers in a designated configuration. Access roads restrict tile placement but also score points when integrated. Flowers score automatically and help habitats and watchtowers score. Animal habitats can be worth from 2-6 points, but only score if the required land types are adjacent to them by the end of the game. This creates a fantastic puzzle of placing tiles adjacent that can support each other, but it isn't always easy to do.

The other puzzle is the market, where tiles are drafted. Players use ceramic animals to wander through the market - a grid of tiles that varies depending on number of players. You can move your animal forward or to either side (never back, unless you are utterly blocked). This gives you 3 choices in most cases, but if you are on an edge or in a corner, you have less choice. Other player's animals can also block you. Even though you can be forced to take tiles you don't need, you can always choose where to place in your tableau, which mitigates the unexpected turns the market can take. You won't score every habitat, but those you don't score are usually supporting tiles that do (if you play it right!). There are also 3 scoring rounds that give points for achieving target configurations in your tableau. These are less points, but can make a difference in close scores.

Factory Fun (also by Corne) is one of my favorite thinky mid-length fillers, but is such a spacial challenge that is has a limited audience. Habitats, I think, will play a similar role, but be more accessible for more people and something I can enjoy two-player with my wife.

RATING: 6
There's a 4x6 grid of square tiles. Each tile shows a single terrain type and another feature, often an animal. Each turn you move your little playing piece within the 4x6 grid and take the tile you land on. You can only move one space, and you cannot move back to the space you moved from last turn. The tile you take enters your personal tableau.

To score points you need to supply what the animals want. The non-human animals want to be adjacent to certain terrains, the human animals (tourists of your growing nature preserve) want certain conditions to be fulfilled for end game points (for example have a large jungle region, or have a lot of small water regions). There are also some between round scoring condition cards that players are competing to score.

The game works well. The puzzle of building your tableau so that all the animals are satisfied is fun. It isn't a particularly deep or demanding game, but it's pleasant and does offer you some choices.

I found the constraints on tile selection to be too extreme. You often really want a particular type of terrain and there is nothing you can do about it. Even if one is on the board making your way over to it means traversing multiple tiles that you may have no interest in. To add to this other players are squished into this grid with you, so you don't even know what will be available on your next turn. On many turns you don't even have a choice of 3 tiles because you're on the edge of the grid. In short planning is very limited and the result feels rather random.

It's nice to see a tile game where you can put any tile next to any other tile. There's no matching this or that feature together. The tension in tile placement comes from the requirements to score points. An interesting, if sometimes frustrating, game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
In Habitats players have to move one step ahead, to the right or to the left and then take the tile they land on to incorporate it into their own park. Three variable intermediate scorings are followed by the final scoring where each single tile has the chance to score points when the neighbouring tiles fulfil certain requirements. These requirements can be slightly confusing which might be a difficulty for casual gamers. 

There's more to Habitats than meets the eye on first sight. Planning ahead two or three moves is decisive. Otherwise, tiles have to be taken that don't match anywhere and ruin point scoring opportunities. One of the best Cwali titles together with Powerboats and Factory Fun.

This may grow on me with a few more plays and I did enjoy my first play but it didn't wow me playing my brother's nice PnP edition. I'm looking forward to giving it another play with more people to see how it plays with more than 2. I suspect there would be more interaction with a larger player count even with the tile selection map being larger. The variable round end goals do mix things up from game to game as far as focus goes.

After reading through the rating comments, the only con I could possibly agree with is the way you might sometimes get 'trapped' at the edge of the market with only one possible choice. However while there is an element of randomness and luck of the draw in the tiles that come out, I would argue that it only encourages you to adapt and be flexible. While the tile you are forced to take might not be of much use to you in the moment, it could become useful later. Planning ahead is still possible - just don't get too attached to your plans. 
As someone else said, it's nice to be able to put your tiles down without placement restrictions. This is a good tile placement game, with lovely components. I would have preferred a deeper box with a better insert. Very much a keeper.

Habitats is surprisingly good. Why surprising? After my first play I thought it was just another tile placement game with minimal interaction. Was I ever wrong! Once you've played a few times you really have to think ahead by both by scanning the ever changing market and scoping your own territory. The great variety of tiles provides diverse landscapes and critters each game. So there's great appeal here. Habitats is thoughtful, engaging, charming, and even relaxing. It's just good fun to figure out what your park is going to look like. Also, the artwork is lovely and contributes to the fine feel of the game. Awesome to draw and place a swallow-tail kite! It's curious to suggest that a game with random tiles popping out each turn has hidden depths. But it does. With experience you have a better ability to read the two landscapes. Neat! I've played it about ten times as a two player contest. It takes about 40 minutes and is totally absorbing. I'm sure it's great with 3 or 4 if no one takes too much time to make a decision.

Very easy family style game. Plays well. My issues are that, even after a few games, I still mistake the forest icon with the grass one's tile due to the similar color.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]Habitats has been a huge surprise and will definitely be in my top 10 new to me games for 2017. I hadn't heard of this game till saw [user=punkin312]Steph[/user] write about it in one of her post Essen blogs. I decided to get a copy for my older daughter based mostly on the fact that she loves animals and the player pieces are porcelain animals. We also enjoy tile laying games so I was hopeful it'd turn out to be a fun game and it was. In fact Habitats is easily my favorite tile laying game because of the new twists introduced in the game.

In Habitats tile selection isn't a random draw, there is a grid of tiles set up and you have to move your animal player piece around the grid to select a tile. This sets up plenty of opportunity to try and plan out your path and the tiles you want; however your opponent(s) typically get in the way. That sets up a fair amount of player interaction since you can never be sure the tile you want will still be there by the time you can reach it.

The end game goals add just enough in game scoring to matter in the end game without being a necessity. Also they may guide you in a certain direction when building your park since the goals will not be completed just by playing the game, you have to deliberately plan how you build your refuge if you want to score them. Lastly the way animals will score is a fun puzzle to solve. Each animal is on one of four habitat types, but they need to be adjacent to other specific types before they will be scored. 

All the rules are very intuitive and become second nature after a few turns. Habitats has also proven to be very easy to teach, even to folks new to the hobby. Habitats would be a great gateway/family game, unfortunately the only thing holding it back is the limited print run [i](which was due to the limited number of porcelain figures designer/publisher Corné van Moorsel could get)[/i]. Hopefully this game gets wider exposure and maybe another publisher will be able to reprint the game and get it out to a wider audience.[/i]

Fun theme for this lighter tile laying game. The theme fits the mechanics well. Has some fresh mechanics for selecting tiles, placing tiles, and especially scoring the tiles. It's lighter, but still gives a fine amount of decisions. There's mid-game and end-game scoring. This is a fun one!

A deep puzzle game. Granted, the market restricts your choice considerably but it forces you to look a few steps ahead. All in all, this will hurt those who need lots of control (Rosenbergs look elsewhere). Brainburner.

This is a fun, easy-going game, but with enough depth and tactical options. The choosing mechanic is original, but I'm not sure if it's good or fits the game (I have the feeling there could have been another solution for this). Good game, not overly impressed.

本遊戲在教育性上我多加了0.5分，除了認識動物的英文名稱以外，教學遊戲時，可以說明是有足夠條件的棲息地，動物才會願意過來住這觀念。美術也是畫了很多美麗的動物賞心悅目，遊戲過程有兩階段的決策，首先是拿版塊，依據自己標誌物的位置與方向給與1/1到1/3的選項而且也決定未來可以拿板塊的走向，拿到的板塊要拼在何處又是一個決策的點，除了要盡力滿足動物棲地的需求外，每年的公共得分目標卡，自己園區裡的瞭望台、旅客分數都可能要顧慮到，真的需要動腦規劃一下，這點做得很棒!
缺點的部分，一版的動物造型標誌物模型粗糙不說，其實還蠻不實用造成顏色及方向判定上的困擾，園區門口版塊的顏色判定也不明顯不直觀，再來還有盒子大小與收納設計的不算方便，雖然這家出版社應該是有意讓自己公司出版的遊戲使用這種形狀size的盒子，但內盒還是可以設計再聰明一點啦!!公共得分卡的一些條件也比較難解釋......最後我覺得不討厭的點就是沒完成棲地條件的動物版塊要反著放這規則，造成操作和視覺上的麻煩，好險這在我自己用統一的小圓片來遮住沒完成的動物改善完成= =
雖然有這些小缺點，但此遊戲整體我還是給予高評價蠻推薦入手的。

Easy tile-laying abstract game. Can easily teach new gamers or even non gamers. Adorable ceramic figures. I want to collect them all! Or at least trade for the ones I really want! Great theme and all around love this game. Won't be leaving my collection at least for a very very long time. I can't help but love this one!

Tile placement, set collection scoring, mostly solo puzzle. Family friendly, light/filler game. Tile placement decisions center around meeting the requirements for the various animals, not on whether the edges of the tiles match, can still feel a bit restrictive. Unfortunately, nothing really grabbing me here.

Very pleasant game to play with older kids but REAL fun for veteran gamers as well. Great components (especially beautiful 1st edition ceramic animals...I'm very pleased I have backed almost every Cornel's game to date). Smoothly implemented 'non-aggresive ' educational factor quite strong and very welcomed. Every animal tile has DIFFERENT animal on it ! Very good for all player counts (2-5). Grea.

     This game is a blast and I love the artwork. It's an excellent puzzle and it plays great and fast with 2p like all of Corne's games. I am a big fan of his work. His games are quirky and they all have a signature feeling that you know you're playing a game of his. The guy is super underrated. Puts out really cool stuff. Now I Can't wait to  get my hands on Factory Funner.

Fantastic game. The tile placement has an interesting puzzling aspect. The tile selection is slightly interactive and allows for some advanced planning. Great length for the decisions available. The scoring is clear. The artwork is nice. Only graphic complaint: the player colours on the starting tiles could have been more obvious.

Nice little family game that does its best to do my head in. It can be a little tricky to supply those animals with their habitat requirements and the tourists with their road access and watchtower views. There's a good tile acquisition system as you block and race to the tiles you need. Then how you'll place them in you park you'll need to have planned ahead for. Tally up the points at the end (with three little target scorings on the way), and you have a winner.

Not bad. The two parts of the game work well together and require some serious thought at times. Never-the-less you can pick and place and the next player has already started their turn while you're checking your placement. So the game pace ticks along well. Happy to keep and explore further. Rules are quick to refresh and there's enough in the game to keep it coming back.

Lapkalerakós játék a jó fajtából. Szafarit épít minden játékos, amit állatokkal, virágokkal népesít be. Ezek fix pontot hoznak, illetve turistákat csalogat, megfigyelőtornyokat épít, ami különböző összefüggő területekért vagy adott irányban levő dolgokért ad pontokat. Az utakkal lezárjuk állatkertünk terjeszekedését, cserébe pontokat szerzünk. A játék érdekessége a lapkaszerzés. Mindenki egy mátrixban lépked és a vele szemben és két oldalt levő lapkából vehet el, a háta mögül nem. Ezt még szűkíti a mátrix széle és a többi játékos figurája. Egyszerű, de jól működő kiválasztás, ami szűkössége miatt nem is lassú, így valószínűleg 5 fővel sem lassú a játék. Gyorsan lejátszható, szép kivitelű, amihez hozzájárul az ötlet, hogy a játékos figurái festett nem műanyag állatok, amelyek minden dobozba véletlenszerűen kerülnek bele.
Abszolút tetszett.

Build a wild life park! :) 
You need to make sure that the animals all get the specific invironment (grass, forest, water or stone) they ask for, otherwise they wont score at the end of the game.  
It´s a tilelaying game whit a cool new idea. The tiles are put on the table to form a grid and the player meeples, who are these adorable little porcelain animals, have to move around and pick up the tiles. Which direction you can go is limited and the choices you make affect the future tiles you can reach.  

Really enjoy this game! 
It plays very smoothly, has nice components, is farely easy to teach and has a beautiful tablepresens when you see the different parks evolve and expand.

Pretty light, and the way you pick up tiles can make it difficult to find what you're looking for. Can be important to make sure opponents aren't cutting you off in a corner. Creating the park is enjoyable and there are enough options for placement and concerns for how to score that the puzzle is satisfying. Also the tiny ceramic animals are a fun component change from typical Euros.

Played at Spiel '17. A very streamlined game, which looks very good. Move your worker, pick a tile, place it. Turns are very quick, our 3-player game lasted less than 30 minutes. Very impressed, maybe I end up getting a copy.

Kickstarted. 2nd Edition

Habitats is a fantastic family level tile laying game. But make no mistake, there are lots of crunchy decisions to be made as you consider the placement of each new tile. Lots of forward planning is needed as you can see many turns ahead, and hoping you make it to that tile you need can create some very tense moments.

Very glad to have kickstarted this, Plays very quickly and scales really well, it's a great 2 player game. I'm enjoying it more and more with each play.

You fight for tiles in the shared pool that's replenished every time a player has picked from it. You then try to place it the best way possible in your own tableau. And that's hard. In many ways this is like Glen More but harder. And with ugly Chinese ceramic animals.

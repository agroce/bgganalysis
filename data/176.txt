Now this is really a strange and confusing game. I guess this is it's intention too. This game doesn't want to be taken seriously and if you play this game just for having some silly fun, then this is also what you get. But don't plan strategy or tactics.

RATING: 6
Great cards ("I can hear the ocean..."), and a good game.  The brain moves around a lot and more than once I was caught cursing under my breath due to the cards that were given me.

Does get old after repeated plays.
Almost every job requires one to "screw thy neighbor".  If you don't like that kind of game then this is not one for you.

RATING: 6.8
I would call this a good example of a pretty fun meaningless beer and pretzels game, unlike, say, the munchkin series, which is bereft of life. It can absolutely drag on and on, but tends to not do so. Not good for lots of play either.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

I have the original 'cheapass" Cheapass game version. Super fun theme, but the components are well "cheapass" and I think it lacks in replayability (w/o alcohol, that is)

More game here than I expected, but still not really worth playing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
Played once with 6 players. The game never ended, when someone was close to winning they alway got some new cards and the game went on. Not my type of game with much luck and random things going on.

The original Zombie Fluxx.  This is a fun, if slightly too long game.  There's not much strategy involved, but the gameplay is pretty entertaining.

RATING: 4
Too much different English text in cards to be Understanded by all players. Big die :)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A long-time favorite around our house, where we read the cards out loud with goofy zombie voices. A lot of fun.

Note: I have both the full-color deluxe edition and the original real-cheap version. Oh, and a button.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Warning: Hard to enjoy for those who don't get 'zombie humour'. I am not usually biased against randomness but with luck-of-the-draw and luck-of-the-die this game is borderline. So forget about strategy: no risk of analysis paralysis with this game. I sold my b&w 1st edition and got the expanded colour edition almost just for the art.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Great theme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Funny theme, entertaining artwork, and the names of some cards are genuinely worthy of laughing out loud. Unfortunately, the game itself doesn't match up. Essentially a game of random cards with success relying on the role of a single die, it's shallow and not a massive amount of fun. A shame, given the artwork. I had a big sponge brain to use with the game, and it ended up being more fun throwing this at each other when the brain got stolen than any fun that was garnered from the game itself.

RATING: 2
I have the original cheapo version with cardstock cards.  Took this one to work to try out during lunch.  We played about a dozen games (over a week or so) and I liked it less and less each time.  While the game does have a somewhat amusing theme and cards, the gameplay is terrible.  It is extremely chaotic - worse than Fluxx in my opinion.  I think the most irritating thing is having cards in your own hand that you have to play sometime or another that by all odds in the game will screw yourself over.  There are way too many of those and that is largely what ruins this game for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Finish your jobs to win - but if it's a job that requires the brain, you'll have to grab it first!  Quite a bit of luck, but it makes for a satisfying, quick, fun filler.

I have to be careful, because if I rated this game after my first hilarious night, it'd be a nine!  However, that quickly wears off, and it settles down to be a light little filler, with some giggles.

RATING: 6
Humorous card game (if Zombies is a theme you find funny!). Quite quick, a little chaotic (turns jump around, you might not get a turn for a while, especially with 8 ...), certainly fun to read the cards initally, not sure of it's staying power if you played it frequently.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Get rid of all your cards, so you can get off work. Except that you work at a fast food restaurant, and are a zombie. The theme is cute and well-implemented, but a lot comes down to luck of the draw.

this game takes a while and occasionally lapses into tedium, but I'm willing to get sucked into it once in a while.  On the whole the bidding aspect is fun, and the cards are typical cheap ass games, which I find funny.  The illustrations are halarious.

The fun theme makes this game of Zombies working in a fast food restaurant in hell. They fight over possession of the one brain needed to do more complex tasks. The names of the dishes are a blast.

It's good for a laugh. Continuing the empty your hand style games of the Zombie restaurant.

This is for the original version, the later versions tended to drag. It is amusing trying to rid your hand of cards in a game that mostly has you drawing cards.

The game is more fun if you zombie speak the reasons why you need the brain.

RATING: N/A
A silly, fun, random, ridiculous card game. Each player takes on the role of a Zombie working in a fast food restaurant in hell. We all have jobs to do before we can get off work but there is only one brain between all of us that we have to share to finish our work. I love this game as a filler between complicated long games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
The graphics and flavor text will convince many non-gamers to try this game at least once. Unfortunately, most of them quickly lose interest once they have seen all of the cards. However, the game itself is simple, light and quick - making it a good "filler" game.

Cheap Ass Games do seem to have the humour thing going with their offerings, and Give Me the Brain is no exception. Unfortunately, there isn't a lot of game hiding underneath the cute idea of beind an undead burger flipper of the damned and competing with the other players to maintain control of the singular brain in the establishment.

A classically light American style game with a lot of take that and chaos thrown in. Dice are used to determine a number of things, and the difficulty that one has is largely determined by how lucky one is drawing easier tasks off the top of the deck. Not a lot of decisions though, and the game largely seemed to be playing itself. Beyond the cute theme there really isn't much in the way of substance.

Combine Cheater and Uno, then add a bunch of zombies that have to perform tasks and you have a fun humorous game that plays quickly. As a zombie at a fast food restaurant, you have to be on your toes and perform a multitude of tasks to satisfy your boss and the patrons. Some of these tasks are a little bit more difficult then others and require a brain. Trouble is, there is only one brain between the bunch of you. A lot of this game involves trying to get the brain from the other players and it gets passed around a lot. I would give this game a 7 plus an extra point for the low cost. This may be the most fun per cost in the history of modern games. Thank you Cheapass and may you find that third hand.

So light, comical, and random that it's hard to rate it any higher.  But it was fun to play, and funny also.  It reminds me a little of Munchkin with the humor aspect, but the game is more like a zombie version of Uno.   Plus a little bidding and little dice rolling.

Mildly amusing card game, especially the bid cards indicating reasons why one should be given the brain, such as "The customer is wrong," "I have to count the meat," and "I can hear the ocean."  Zombies!  In some ways like a zombie-themed Fluxx, in that play can be tactical only, with long term strategy rendered impossible by chaotic randomness in card effects.

RATING: 3
Good for a laugh or two, mostly from talking about performing a One Hand Job or a Two Hand Job. Otherwise, a totally random game that can break. Give Me the Brain has a clunky turn order mechanism that allows players to be skipped. On a good draw, someone can win in a single turn (high bid cards and jobs with high targets). It might be workable with three or four players at the most, and the players play the whole thing as quickly as possible, but why bother when there are better fillers out there?

RATING: 2
Yet another entry in the supposedly fun, completely random card game filler category. Like many others, this one also has the problem that it can easily outstay its welcome, and with a bad hand just sitting out because you simply can't do anything isn't exactly a lot of fun. Shares the trait with Munchkin that the card art may be funny the first time around but quickly pales thereafter.

We love this one. It's basically a "take that" game but somehow the theme and brain mechanics make it a blast. It works well for even our 8yo though some of the artwork and text may be a little crass for some. "Give me the brain" has become a standard phrase in our house when someone has to do something they don't really want to do.

Lightweight, and shortlived interest wise. No where near worth $14.95, color version or not.

Unfortunately doesn't reinforce its own goal of emptying your hand, and players can start a lot of around the table 'take-that' actions and it will go on, and on, and on, and on....

I won't miss it if I never play it again actually.

This is an average little card game where the players try to get rid of all their cards. There is the possibility of screwing the other players but half the cards seem to screw yourself just as badly which can be a bit frustrating. Quite quick to teach and usually quick to play though.

RATING: 5
Lots of fun to be had in this crazeee card game. Sort of a fluxx-lite (i.e. less chaotic) with a brilliant theme of zombies in a fast-food restaurant.

Probably best with only a few players.. say 3 to 4... works very well in our lunchtime game group, although we have tired of it a little, in favour of Guillotine.

With pink squishy "Splatball" brain that I got for a buck at Walmart. Random silliness that is fun to play with the kids and their friends. Husband, who is a very quiet, dour man stood up, pointed, and said, "Look, a monkey!" Everyone turned to look before we realized he was just playing the card. And yes, he had swiped the brain before we turned back.

* Kickstarted with Stuff And Nonsense! *

Bid on control of the brain. Play job cards - some of which need you to control the brain. Drop the brain if you fail. That's all there is to it, but it's meant to be a small, quick game.

PLUS: easy to learn, speed of play
MINUS: easy to win

Really liked this game a few years ago. Got a chance to play it again.  It didn't quite hold up to memory.  Part of it was I was just tired, but  the novelty does tend to wear off and the game can last too long.  I'd suggest some sort of random timer mechanism or after a certain number of go around some sort of mechanism can stop the game and the person with the least cards win.

Takes the "empty your hand first" mechanism from "Uno" and gives it a twist.

Sure to be a huge hit with family and friends.

Give Me the Brain is a humorous and fast paced card game with a surprisingly well delivered theme. Unlike other silly confrontational card games, the abundant take-that mechanisms present don't make the game drag: an average session will be finished in ten to fifteen minutes, while a lengthy one can last up to twenty.

The premise is quite simple: a fast food restaurant from hell has hired a bunch of zombies. Players embody one of those zombies and their goal is to finish their work before everyone else. First one to finish and go home wins. Being a fast food restaurant, most tasks are done on autopilot and do not require much thought, but the more complex ones require an extra effort. The more complex ones requires zombies to think, to use their brains. But there is only one brain. One brain, multiple zombies who want it.

While not all cards are illustrated, which can be surprising considering its humorous tone, they capture the theme perfectly well. The texts, the descriptions, the actions... They are all hilarious and thematic. My favourite is, and will ever be, the mope: "Want to go home? Nope! Here's the mope! You aren't going anywhere until you finish mopping the floor!".

Work tasks take the form of cards: the first player who empties his hand has finished his work, thus winning the game. This is what prevents the game from dragging: the more the game goes on, the more likely is for someone to run out of cards. It only scales well up to five players though, preferably four, as with more it begins to drag.

While I wouldn't recommend anyone working at a hellish fast food chain, working at a fast food chain from hell is super fun! Great parody card game.

Whether you get the deluxe (color) edition that actually has a box, or the original game that came in a paper envelope, Give Me The Brain! is an amusing little romp through a silly fast-food restaurant operated by zombies.  It's not a serious game by any stretch of the imagination, but it's a great, lighthearted game that's suitable for young and old alike.  It's also a quick game to play once you know the rules (which are really easy to learn), and you can't beat the price of the original - how often will you find a game that retails at $5 American or less?  All in all, it's worth picking up for those days when you have a good handle on the ridiculous.

Increased my rating from a 5, not because it's the greatest game in the world, but because with the right crowd the theme works well and it is possible to overcome some of the legitimate concerns about randomness. Better than Fluxx in almost every imaginable way.

RATING: 4
Give Me the Brain has an incredibly cute theme, and for me it's emblematic of early Cheapass games as a whole: It makes the most of inexpensive components and simple rules, but starts off more fun than it winds up.

Before I sat down and rated my games played, I would have guessed that I liked Cheapass games more in general than turned out to be the case. But the more I think about them, the more of them follow this arc. I don't get anything out of GMtB that I can't get more of from other filler games.

Not a very good cheapass showing. There is a crazy amount of chance in the game and the downtime between turns can be really long. A bit better with a max of three players and used as killing time when waiting for more people to arrive.

This game has a fantastic theme, it's truely chaotic and can be quite fun.  I bought it for my brother and played it with my family and we all enjoyed it.  Not really my favourite type of game but give it a try if you're willing to trade strategy for laughs.  Game probably gets old quick but it's cheapass so who cares.  UPDATE: this does get old fairly quick.

Hillarious the first few times you play and a great start to any gaming night.  I've played Give Me the Brain probably twenty or more times now, and though I've lost interest at this point, I have a special place in my heart for it.  This was the title that got all my friends who had never gamed into the hobby, and those of us who hadn't games for years back into it.  The price, as with all Cheap Ass Games, is totally right.  Worth checking out, if only once.

3+ players, can get a little wonky with too many players. 30 minutesish. It's fast and easy to learn.  Almost everyone seems to love it.  I gave away my first copy, and lost my second copy when my bag was stolen, and decided to get Lord of the Fries, instead, which turned out to be a dud.  Then I bought a third copy. I miss the smaller box the older version came in.

RATING: 10
This game is one of the best games that Cheapass Games has produced in my opinion.  It's relatively fast and easy to learn and is loads of fun.  The various bid card art has great humorous pictures of zombies working in fast food jobs.  I picked up the first edition of this game (the one that came in the paper envelope) and like the game enough to immediately order the Special Edition when it came out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I picked up this game in 2000 and immediately liked it.  The game is fast, fun and easy to learn.  It plays best with a group of 3-4 and the games tend to be short enough to get in a 2-3 games over the course of the evening with friends.

I've givin this version a '9' rating only because I feel the game is worth buying the Special Edition of for the full-color art and better quality cardstock.  It still plays as a '10' though in my opinion!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Only played this game a couple times but it seems inappropriate for more than five players.  With six or more players too much depends on having a good hand of bid cards, which are more sparsely divided, and an unlucky hand can leave you without any chance to win without help from others.

A Cheapass classic! Not a full-course meal - it's more a side order of fries type of game.  Silly fun and a great filler.  Amusing artwork.  Works even better if players stay in zombie character.  Must have made an impression on me because I actually sculpted a small brain out of Milliput to use as a token (see the images for this game).  Adds a little bit of 3D fun.  I bought this new for myself after playing a friend's copy.  "Give me the braaaiin..."  Ended up selling it on eBay on 9 Dec 2007 for AU $9.95.

A highly-random, pretty cutthroat filler. At least the one game I played was short (15 minutes). Apparently it can run an hour ("Just shoot me now!").

I first played this game at Origins '97... it was around 10pm in the open gaming area when a guy named James Ernest comes walking in with a briefcase.  James was an unknown but I recognized him from his booth, one folding table in 1/4 stall with almost no decoration and a stand holding black and white printed envelopes.  It was directly across from the US Playing Card Company booth where I was working, teaching X-Files.  This guy, James, starts telling us all about his cheap cardstock games and whips out Give Me the Brain!  We stayed there until about 2am playing games with him.  He sold the entire contents of his briefcase that night and the following Sunday he was taking orders telling everyone he'd ship the game free when he got back to home-office.    Fast forward 5 years and, after a stint in the Marines I returned to Origins to find this James guy in a massive booth with tons of fans and about 100 game titles.  Amazing.  I love to play this game anytime and the memories of that long night with James is what makes open gaming so special to me.

(Original Printing) I played a lot of this in college but haven't really since. The 'two-hands' mechanic is my favorite part, with a close second being reading off the reasons WHY you need the brain in the bidding phase.
(Reprint Version) I would actually put this just a little lower than the original. Yeah, the cards are nicer, but the novelty 'brain' die is actually stupidly massive and the addition of some more convoluted items and effects makes the game move far slower than the original, which I think kind of goes against the concept. Still good though!

Well, here's one, at least, that I didn't come in filled up on hype on. When this got broken out on New Years, I was fully prepared from the name and box for a humor-based barely-a-game card game, and that's about what I got. It's nothing terrible, but I didn't really find much of value in it, either. I didn't really find most of the cards all that amusing--as opposed to, say, Munchkin or Chez Geek, where I at least found the cards worth a chuckle or two--and the gameplay itself felt like the less enjoyable parts of Fluxx, where you end up forced to play cards you don't want to due to your situation. That and the fact that you may go a long time between turns due to brain-dropping and various screw-your-neighbor cards, and I just don't see much of a point to playing this. I'd say it's okay for killing time, but, honestly, I'd rather play Fluxx or some other filler in that time.

RATING: 6
A very simple card game that's most fun if you get into the theme by reading the cards in zombie voices.  There's really no strategy and not much in the way of actual gameplay.  It's a very simple game that plays quick.  I'll probably suggest this as a very light starter or filler.

I don't really like games where you could twiddle your thumbs for several turns while other players do all sorts of things, and then when it gets to your turn you have to pass because you do not have any legal moves. You guys go ahead and play this so-called game, I'm going to have a staring contest with my cat.

This is the first Cheapass game I've purchased, and it's a blast!  I don't know how replayable it will prove to be, but as we've only run a couple of hands so far and not even made it through a quarter of the cards, I suspect we'll be enjoying it for a while yet.  Very quickly picked up, we played it cold in a Tim Horton's with a (formerly) cranky baby being passed around as the Brain.  He loved it when we'd explain "Must EAT baby's BRAIN ..!"  Many giggles.  Great game. Update: Still fun, but the blush is off.  Solid 7, though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Tough rating.  I've liked this game the few times I've brought it out.  For some reason, no one in my game group can figure it out.  The whole concept of having "two hands" for some reason doesn't click with anyone I play with, and because of that, all my plays have been uninteresting.  I don't get it, because all of my friends [i]also[/i] have two hands, yet can't grasp the concept of extending that to a game.  I look at it many weeks and think "Should I bring this to game night?  Nah, next time."  It's been many next times, and it hasn't returned.

Still willing to give it another shot though, and I hope that the rating will go up.

Love the Zombie theme, and I often find that I have to share my brain at work, so the theme fits. Doesn&#039;t replay a whole lot  though. Also, the theme of working at a fast food joint isn&#039;t the most exiting, as the closer it is to real, the less fun it *has* to be. Reminds me of the three days I spent working at McBurgers in Carbondale.

This game CAN be a LOT of fun - a total laugh riot - if someone can win in the first half hour or so... but if no one manages to, and the games starts to drag on because no one seems to be able to play that last card in their hand and ends up picking up another mitt-full... well... it's less fun.

This game isn't much of a strategy game because the cards dictate so much of the game play.
That said, this game is a laugh riot! We always read cards out loud when playing and use silly voices. It's so much fun to play with casual gamers because they really get into the style of the game and we can still have a conversation.
YAY BRAINS!

Working in fast-food is hell. All the employees are zombies, and you can't find a single brain amongst them. Except for the brain part - there is, in fact, one brain - that's the premise of Give Me the Brain, a card game in which players take on the roles of zombies in a fast-food restaurant in hell. They all have to complete a number of tasks before leaving work, and the work keeps piling on. Even worse, some of the tasks require basic intelligence and there's only one brain to go around.

This is the small box card game made for ME.  
I've played it 30+ times, which is wild for a small self contained card game deck.

Everything about it tickles me.  The theme, the mechanics, the flavor, but most of all the bidding!  In this game, when a player drops the one brain that everyone is sharing, each zombie gets to make their case for why they are most in need of a brain.  Each bid card has a completely ridiculous task, and is ranked by the severity of the need.  These reasons are also the most heavily illustrated cards, and the art is just fantastic.

I can't help but smile everytime I pull this out.

That said, I've had friends say they played this game without me, and found it to be boring.  Apparently my excitement and joy and laughter over this game is infectious, and makes other people excited about it.  

If the idea of a fastfood restaurant run by comically inept zombies, with the goal of just getting to leave your job makes you chuckle, pick up this game.

Fun only in the right setting. Imagine: 3 am, after 5 hours of poker and beer with your high school friends, everyone is brainfried and exhausted. Then imagine playing a game where you are all zombies in a fast food restaurant with only one brain to share among you. THAT'S the right way to play this game.
Oh, and yes: a little brain to pass around definitely enhances the experience.

I've got the new colour set, and this one definitely gets an "A" for visual appeal, but it reminds me a bit of Fluxx in the way the current state of the game is incessantly changing.  Too much luck for it to be anything but a light filler, but I can't argue with the fun factor of the theme.

Pretty simple game but all the better for it.  I like the slip-stream mechanism and the card redraw space.   Definitely better with 8 or more players.  Hard if you get far behind, so don't get behind!

Simple, elegant design.  Played and enjoyed many times.  The suspicion is that if I could only do the maths, I could entirely optimise my moves and this would be no fun at all.

Finally got in another play and I like it better than before - especially running multiple races.  But it&#039;s really quite dry, and the gameplay feels, well... dated.  Still haven&#039;t played with the full complement of eight yet.

RATING: 1
Dreadful "racing game" that has zero racing feel.  Sprint out to a lead and you'll lose because no one will (or can) help you; you'll just sit there while everyone else conspires and catches up. And they'll be telling each other what the "correct" plays are the whole time. An annoying exercise in mathematics.

A good multi-player game that I have played several times with 'non-gamers'. However the six rounds can be a lot for those with a short attention span. To spice the game up slightly we keep the yellow racer counter out and give it to the race leader after each round. It's amazing the effect fighting for the yellow jersey has.

RATING: 4
The first game was really interesting and I rated it a 7; that became a 6 after the second game; after the third I make any effort to avoid it; I don't think it has a lot of replayability value; nevertheless it may accomodate up to 8 players and if your group is so large and you don't want to split in 2 tables it may worth a try (but I'd suggest to drink some beers during the game so that you can forget that there are many better games in the world)

RATING: 7.5
A classic of German game design.  One of the first of those minimalist designs I played and was much impressed by.  It's still a sentimental favourite for that reason and ranks alongside 'Demarrage' and 'Leader 1' in my all time list of cycling games.

Another terribly overrated game, probably due to it's relative scarcity. Not bad, but certainly doesn't have anything on Breaking Away (Fiendish Games).

I played garygarrison's goose race retheme and thought it was quite a hoot. The peloton mechanism is quite neat, but ultimately breaks down into chaos. I'd be very interested to see this played as a team game as it would actually encourage the type of slingshotting that should really only happen in the regular game through the misplay of others.

Early race game which, in the days before there were so many games, was highly regarded.  It is a fun race game when played as a single race.  The rules expect multiple-races but then it gets a little tiresome.

I'm pretty picky about racing games, and this one didn't do it for me.  Too much control on the one hand, and too easy to hurt a specific opponent on the other.  I like Breaking Away a lot more if I want a game similar to this.

Only downside is the lenght for a full set of rounds with lots of players.

Played as a 3p game with only 1 rider each which was a mistake - the game works with several riders. But I enjoyed the mechanism a lot, it did feel like track cycling and I definitely will try this again with more players. My two colleagues were sceptical at first, but won over. *** Now played as a 5p game and it is much better, quite the purist's tactical game. Unless you're playing with a TOTALLY SELFISH PERSON, when you'll be made to cry.

Wonderful yet simple mechanism in this race game. There's always one rider who seems to get left behind, much to the amusement of the other players. An example of 1980's German games, no longer quite as good as we all thought at the time it came out.

RATING: 6
Still gets played because it's one of the rare games that is actually any good with 7-8 players.  I prefer the more tactical Breaking Away with 5-6 players (and Um Reifenbreite with 4), but the extremely fast-paced 6-Tage Rennen is the best choice for a group of 7 or 8.  Six races is quite a lot; four days is usually sufficient for me.  Any fewer and it may be impossible to recover from one bad day.  Also, my feeling is that one lap lost per four spaces behind the finish line might be too harsh a penalty.  Next time I play, I'd like to try it with a more relaxed rule to promote closer finishes and bring the point scoring into the spotlight.  Maybe one lap lost per six spaces? [Update] One lap lost per six spaces worked well.  Maybe the final race should revert to the usual rule to maintain tension?

RATING: 7
Despite it's flaws I've had great fun with this one over the years.  The excitement coming off the fouth bend into the final stretch is palpable...and less damaging than a pint of redbull.  It's a good one for casual gamers (as long as the 'move now or die' rule is in place).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
One of the earliest cycling games, but about as good as many more recent efforts. Everyone starts with the same cards, but tries to maximise the amount of free movement thay get by landing on occupied spaces. It's entirely tactical, your move can be dictated by what others do and when you can't catch up anymore because you don't have the right card then your game is over. I'm not really convinced by the 'pit stop' mechanism whereby you draw a fresh hand, it adds an element of luck and the new cards don't have higher values. In all, a bit of fun, you could card count, but that seems like overkill in such a light game. Of more recent games only Breaking Away is better, so this is a creditable game for its age.

An "oldie but goodie" -- a cycling game with very little luck (only the random draw if you stop to exchange cards).  Don't have the opportunity to play it much these days, and it's definitely best with a large field of 7 or 8, which makes it superior to other cycling games that are often limited to 4 - 6 players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I've usually played this with 6,7,8 players, never fewer - its easy to teach and fun, and really feels like a bike race!  I would give it a higher rating, but it is a little long for the full race schedule - we usually play one, two maybe three races max - there are just so many good games to play these days that that is enough, and we then want to move on to something else.

I recommend playing with 4 players or fewer.  That way each player can run 2 cycles, allowing for some coordinated teamwork.  As an 8-player game, this is a long game of moderate strategy.  With 4 players, and agreement to just run an evenings worth of races, it is fabulous.

What an excellent game, best played with at least 5 players, otherwise its easy to get left behind, at its best with 8 players. It was one of this years Christmas games and we had loads of fun, playing the full 3 races. Dave won in brilliant style. Movement is calculated by bouncing off of players who have already moved, a brilliant system which suits the theme well and which I have not seen repeated anywhere else.

RATING: 9
Very clever race game.  With little or nothing down to chance (unless you indulge in "Fahrenwechsel") it's surprising that there is no perfect plan.  There doesn't seem to be, however, and when you find yourself behind the pack with no way of catching up it is quite hard to put your finger on how you got into this predicament.

Although it can be played with as few as three players, it is much better with more (eight is best).

It was fun to play, racing around, bouncing off each other, very tactical in how you play your cards, make your dash for the sprint lines, watch what your opponents are up to etc. Only thing is, remember it's a race, so play fast & stop memorising how many & what cards your opponents have played!!!

Good fun and played it often in the few years after it came out. Play now with irregular game players
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Too repetitive for repeat play, but an enjoyable occasional outing of hand management, planning and temporary co-operation that simulates the pain of not being in the peloton quite well.

One-lap games are ok but playing multi-race is better, where the number of laps behind (or lack thereof) is the winning condition and points is the tie-breaker. Whilst the game already has a wonderful peloton feel to it, the extra strategic layer of determining who to work with in the latter races based on how many laps they're down ramped the game up another notch. The mathematical nature means it will still only come out maybe once or twice a year, but I know now how to get the best out of it.

I bought this game in the late 70's (I think) tried it a couple of times with different sets of people. No one could really get into it, perhaps it needs more perseverance to work out the tactics, but no one wanted to play it twice.
The components are not very inspiring!!

RATING: 6
Need at least 6 players to make player positions more interesting and the slipstreaming moves more dramatic; however the game pace decreases. Also if you don't stay with the pack, you fall behind which makes for a dull experience for a game of this length. If you're near the front, card counting and which card to play makes for a tense showdown for the finish line.

RATING: 6
An enjoyable game that shines when played over several races. The card play is simple, but is all about who you want to help boost along. These decisions become more interesting as the positions develop across multiple races.  I can't help feeling the start should be solvable based on player numbers, but haven't played enough to know for sure.

Rowdy cycling game when you've got a lot of gamers at the table. It's short and not nearly as chaotic as you might think with a bunch of players crowding the table. It's also a bit simple with the card based energy/speed, but good in the simple Um Reifenbreite style cycling game genre.

Single play. Race games aren't my favourite genre, but this one works really well. A series of card-driven single lap races, but the idea of doubling or tripling the card value if you land on an occupied space works astoundingly well, and drives players to work together to make a breakaway, especially since your cards alone aren't enough to get you around the track.

A surprisingly interesting, abstract, no luck racing game built around a very clever bicycle drafting mechanism.

The problem is that you really need to play a series of 6 races to properly reward overall skill over getting unlucky in your judgment of other players in a single race.

And, then, the game has overstayed its welcome by about 2-3 races... sigh.

leapfrogging racing game on a cycle theme. This is a quick playing, card management game. Work together when behind gives chance for the back markers, breakaway leader has work cut out for themselves and may have to fall back into the group to have a chance. Real game consists of 6 laps and we played 1 which is just about enough.

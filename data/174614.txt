GAME: Apotheca
RANK: 1976
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
*Rating based on one play with four players.

Apotheca is a very light puzzle game.  It is a very short game (at least with 4), too short in fact.  The game felt like we had barely gotten into the game and then it was over.  I think I had maybe 3-4 turns before it ended.  A fellow player who has more experience with the game mentioned that he had learned you need to play the game more defensively, rather than going straight after scoring opportunities, so maybe that would lengthen the game a bit and make it a more enjoyable experience.

That said, I'm not sure there's enough interesting about this game for me to want to come back to it.  It's a mostly abstract game with very little theme to it, and the gameplay is very simple and doesn't do anything novel.  It might make a decent gateway game for new gamers, but I think there are better games for that purpose.  The components are nice, except for the handful of mis-sized tiles, which do have a minor impact on gameplay.

Buy from one of the Malay friend from BG2G as he mentioned he need funding to cure his dad's illness. But sadly I still seeing him buy new games from other >.<

Anyway, this is a very nice short game that has very high replayability. Tic-tac-toe concept and support by the apothecary's skill (similar with Santorini). very fine printing game too.

It's just a bit much for my kids aged 8 & 10, but we still play it all the time.  Very easy to play, it's in our families top 3! 

I feel it's a bit like speed chess, but with pretty pictures and stories, and a nice simple mechanic you can play slow or fast.  Some of the movements were a bit hard for my kids to learn, but there's no reason you need to be 13+ to enjoy this.  Plays 3 very well!

Not a bad two player filler but the game feels under-developed and should be better. The game claims to have four main actions every turn but really there are only two because your apothecary and his special ability get utilized and therefore eliminated pretty quick meaning there may be 5-6 more turns before you can obtain another. Still, a decent game with quick set up/teardown and one that may benefit from a future expansion. The solo variant isn't very fun and not worth the effort.

i have a match 3 problem, i can't play candy crush because my brain grabs it and keeps mulling it over.  This game is really good and really enjoy the idea of special powers that you can use for a little bit.

Got this on Kickstarter, just broke it out last night.  The art makes it look like it's going to be way heavier that in is.  The apothecary is the backdrop, but 

It's a light-to-medium strategy game for 2 to 4.  Placing large colored potions and trying to get a 3-in-a-row.  When you earn three 3-in-a-rows you win.  Lots of other competing pieces, you don't want to set up other players,  extra powers on apothecaries, etc.

We played the standard 4 person version.  I am very interested in the 1 versus 3 variant.

Try to get potions of the same color up-down or left-right to gain points. Secretly place potions face down. Spending gems to get apothecaries to get bonuses that allow you to move tiles around in such a way to score them - which means the bonus then goes away. I'm surprised by the rating (7.8 - though likely because it's all the KS backers...) but doesn't do much for me.

RATING: 5
Surprisingly thinky, and in a bit of a bad way. It is possible to identify the best move, it just takes several brain iterations to identify, and this makes the otherwise simple game drag on. In my experience the game plays very slow and methodically. If I could learn to play this more casually, I think I'd enjoy it more, but I just can't seem to reign myself in.

Update: I have been experimenting with Fischer and Bronstein chess timers to help reduce AP lag, and its been fantastic. So far a 5min timer with a 30 second Bronstein delay seems to be the best.

2 player house rule. When playing 2 players we have a house rule that states you must always have 1 apothecary in play per person. This means you need 2 apothecaries in play before you are allowed to match 3 potions to complete a potion. This simple rule change adds a lot of strategy to a 2 player game, for you can rarely capitalize on 2 quick match 3s, resulting in more defensive plays. Give it a try, I'm certain you'll like it.

I preordered Apotheca when it was a Kickstarter project. I have since played it numerous times with family and friends for great amusement! The games are quick so even if you make a bad move you're not miserable for the rest of a long game, and it allows new players to fumble around the first go-through and start wielding the elaborate strategy the next game in.

The quality and polish of the game are top notch; the little moulded gems and weighty thickness of the potion cards really add to the professional feel of this game.

I love this game and I play it every time we have game night.

Maybe it's group-dependent. When I played this was a big empty board on which matches were snapped up as soon as possible, and luck of the draw with potion color determined most of the results.

There is, in any case, no way to intuitively approach what your opponents can do. You have to play the game for all players in your head, then try to make things hard for others now that you've analyzed exactly what moves they might make. I like interaction, but I also prefer to be able to summarize an opponent so I'm spending more time in my own head than in their heads.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
An abstract game reminiscent of "Bejeweled", albeit with a veneer of theme and very good artwork. The players use their actions to try to line up three tiles of the same color, and the first player to do it three times wins. The biggest twist here is that the potions only move around by the powers of special characters that may be hired during the game. Luck of the draw keeps it at family game level, although there can be quite a bit of thinking.

2016-04-02 - This is a pretty cool 2 player game. It's kind of a mix of Chess and maybe a little Connect Four thrown in? I know, that doesn't sound very good, but it's really a pretty clean design with very simple rules and a decent amount of depth. It's not really good for 3 or 4 players, though, so be skeptical of the player count on the box.

A very elegant tile laying game where players attempt to get sets of a color of potion(red, blue, yellow). First player/team to get 3 sets is the winner. Each player has a special helper that has an ability that alters movement of the board to help score tiles. Otherwise players have to take 2 of the 4 actions of buying a new helpers, using a helper, flipping an unflipped tile, or looking at and placing hidden tiles up to 3 total. The game features a 1v2 or 1v3 variant but I think I just prefer it as a 1v1 or 2v2 game. Plan to play this one a lot more and may up its ranking.

Beautiful art and presentation, and I like the match-3 mechanics, but it just didn't really grab me--I think the bluffing aspect of the game is lost on me, and it felt a bit too chaotic for the game's weight. The solo variant is a neat puzzle, but I'm not a fan of beat-your-highscore goals.

Pros: 

They did a great job of making a "match three" board game. The different apothecary powers give you a lot of flexibility and strategy.

Cons: 

Buying the right apothecary comes down to a lot of randomness since the cost of any given apothecary can be random from game to game, and the way you acquire the different colored gems is mostly random as well.

I have now played this game a number of times with different people and solo.  This game is a fast and fairly light abstract that offers enough depth with the different apothecary cards that more experienced gamers should probably feel satisfied after playing.  That being said, this game has always come down to the wire during plays and I have lost to people with do not typically play games so it remains fun and a challenge.  I like the tactical choices and fast gameplay.

The production is fantastic, maybe a bit exaggerated. 
It is simple tactical abstract that offers quite a few possibilities (AP danger), but I felt it needs something more because you keep doing the same from the start to the end; there’s almost no evolution. Fortunately,it doesn't last long :-)
The cooperative play is not very well developed and feels a bit impaired.

Glorified Tic-Tac-Toe :-) Production value is very high, but cards are not functional. Game is quick and easy and nice. Its OK to play occasionaly, but nothing you havent seen before.

RATING: 7
Excellent family game and game to play with younger players.  It hits that sweet spot of abstract game with just a hint of theme!  Everyone can relate to its tic-tac-toe nature.  You get two actions each turn, from a choice of four.  Once everyone knows the four actions, you're all set.  Then it's just understanding the way your apothecary cards work.  Definitely some good puzzley strategy in this one.  A keeper!

RATING: 8
Great game that can be taught in 5 minutes or less and has enough strategy to keep you on your toes.

Our only change to the standard rules is that instead of drawing a random starting Apothecary draw three and choose one of them. This makes it less likely to have a strong starting advantage.

This is a pretty simple abstract game. I played a couple times. If you play 4p you have to play in teams. I picked this up despite not having played it and then I played it in a 4p game the basic mode. There is an advanced master mode that I have been told is much better. As far as the basic game with 2p it went super fast like 15 minutes with a teach. Ron and I were unenthused with that version. It might actually be better with more players too- since there will be more happening with the board modifications. Ron called it Baby Tash- Kalar. Maybe still in the womb. :P A pretty game that means well. Ultimately probably not for my collection.

Fun, a little light, sadly doesn't build and is so short, that there is very little back and forth. Kickstarter printing on the board was dark, which caused some of the art detail to be lost.

I cant think of anything not to like here. Its an abstract with beautiful art and an actually pretty well implemented theme. It plays fast, is beautiful to look at and can really get your brain burning on trying to pull off some nice combos. Thanks to Kickstarter this game got a GREAT upgrade in production quality. Thick chunky tiles, custom gems and some spot gloss on the board. Really enjoying this one.

A local apothecary shopping for potions to supply their clients' needs. Apotheca or, magical chess as I call it, pits players against each other with variable hero powers to collect sets of potions. It's a wonderful game with superb components and very deep strategic game-play.

Simple and quick. Beautiful abstract tactical game. There's some nice variation in the character cards, which helps keep games fresh. I'd love to see an expansion for this one day to help set it further apart from similar games. I'm worried once Santorini gets released they will both scratch a similar itch.

Average puzzle game with chess-like movements.  There are situations where there might be no good moves yet you still have to make one.  That's not fun and makes the game unappealing.  The whole game just didn't feel very exciting.

Played at Gen Con and enjoyed so much we came back and played again the next day. This is going to be a great family game. Easy enough rule set for all, but definitely some deep thinking for gamers. Played prototype without Kickstarter exclusive potions. Visually stunning and fast paced quick gameplay. Even with my AP prone self and an AP opponent the game was under 40 minutes. Most seem to go under 30 minutes leaving plenty of time for another play!

Thanks so much for teaching and showing us your great game, Andrew! And congratulations on the very successful Kickstarter and partnership with Renegade. Coming hot after a very successful game like Lanterns has the potential to give Apotheca a lot of exposure and buzz. With Apotheca's easy entry with deeper strategy for gamers it could be Renegades big game at the cons next year! 

Kickstarter arrived 3/28/2016. Looks gorgeous!

I was in love with this game when I first got it. The solo variant is actually quite fun and puzzly. We are big fans of deduction games in my family and this game offers just enough of that for new and experienced gamers alike. If you have an alpha player, there's also a Master's variant where one player takes on multiple opponents in a race to complete a potion of each color before their opponents complete 3 potions of any color in total! Component quality on this game is great. Artwork is beautiful!

An interesting blend of "Tic-Tac-Toe" and "Concentration" with special powers thrown into the mix. Honestly, not enough plays to give it a fair rating, but I suspect it will fall between 5-6 for me unless I'm missing something.

Backed on Kickstarter.

My husband and I like the game play--puzzle-y with a chess-like quality combined with bluffing/push-your-luck element. Wow, that sounds like a lot and it does make you think, not for nights when you are tired.

Unfortunately, I hate the artwork. The box front is the ugliest in my collection, the details in the background lost in the dark leaving nothing but the big, ugly faces glaring out. The gloss touches on the board, a total waste of money.

The original game was a card game and I SO wish it had remained so. Instead it became tiles, which are hard to mix--a necessity in this game. Then they became thicker, then BIGGER, then even THICKER. Totally impossible to mix easily without a bushel basket. If the tiles were Carcassonne sized, it would have been much better but these are 4 times that big.

An absolutely gorgeous game. Abstract games tend to be a favorite of mine - but this one fell a bit flat for me. It's a perfectly adequate game, just not exciting or compelling enough to keep in the collection.

RATING: 7
Apotheca is a relatively straightforward abstract with beautiful artwork and 3 modes of play. The standard game is simple to teach and a fun experience. The "Master of the Market" variant is a one vs all with an interesting tweak in the mechanics that adds some complexity to the decision making -- and this mode also works well in 1v1 games. Finally, there is a solo mode, which works and is somewhat engaging (but I definitely wouldn't buy this game JUST as a solo experience). Overall, I find Apotheca an enjoyable and solid entry to the abstract genre and would recommend giving it a shot if it looks interesting to you.

Picked this up on a whim. The artwork is what grabbed my attention. After reading the box, I decided to buy it. Tried it single player first, and surprisingly enjoyed it. Finally played it with friends and the simple concept was enjoyable to all. It definitely seems intimidating at first, but it's a lot simpler than it seems.

We demoed this game at Gen con 2015 and LOVED IT so much that we ordered the late backer kickstarter.  We just recently received it and still love it.   It is a fun memory and strategy challenge that doesn't take forever to learn or to play.  Lots of replay-ability.

Played two 2-players games, might revise the vote later when I try the other modes. Easy to pick up and to explain. KS backer. I love match-3 games in general so this is really cool. Fantastic art direction. The board is somewhat problematic, I folded it twice and I already managed to damage it :( Also, quadrant colors are a bit unclear. Tile height was wrong for one set, but I received replacements so all good there.

Gamer connect 4 does about sum it up.  Although, you are also connecting 3 for most of the time.

The special power cards break normal rules, but I just don't see much here after a play or two for most people.   Might be a bit overproduced and perhaps I don't understand the bluffing aspect that one might use a strategy in placing the cards to the main board.

Abstract strategy tile placement to craft potions in a secret marketplace. Played on a 4x4 grid, hire apothecaries to allow special chess-like and other creative tile movements to arrange 3 orthogonal tiles of a single ingredient. Stock the market gives players hidden information and allows them to seed the market grid to their advantage. Bluff, double bluff and deduction play heavily on these decisions. As does timing and managing of scoring, buying apothecaries and gems, while involved in a mini chess game. I like the tradeoff consideration of collecting a row of ingredients  with losing a special movement. I like how this game plays and think it is a great gateway to introduce a variety of concepts to young gamers.

RATING: 7
Very light fun little game with some fantastic artwork.

Basically it's tic-tac-toe (though other variations are available) on a 4x4 grid, but each player will end up going through a number of special powers that let them move tiles around in fun ways.

Super fast, super fun!

-- Sold: 10/30/16 - Not really deep enough for 2 players, but way to chaotic at 4. Great components though.

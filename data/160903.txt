GAME: Target for Today
RANK: 4095

RATING: 10
I bought B-17 QOTS in 1990 and have played over 2500 times by now. Cannot get enough of the game. Then I found this site where other fans had added to it with their own ideas, tweaks  (New targets, new enemy fighters, repair timetable) etc.

This game takes those ideas and adds many other little details that makes it even better. Didn't think you could improve on B-17 QOTS without getting too buried in charts and rules, but this works well. Besides, I love charts and record keeping and this is the perfect game for that.

RATING: 10
This game and the narrative that it tells is unmatched so far by anything I have ever owned or played. The replayability value, as a result, is immense. 

For my first mission I was flying a B-17F with myself as the pilot. Our target was "industry" in occupied Paris. All of the way to the target the mission went pretty smooth-no mechanical failures or attacks from enemy fighters and our fighter escort was good. The weather was also decent. At the target space however, abandoned by our fighter escort, two crewman were wounded by flak but still, the mission was going as planned. Our bombs were dropped and on target. 

Upon turning for home, while still over Paris, our plane was attacked by a second flak barrage and then enemy fighters again. We were still flying without escorts and our position was in the "low cell" group so we were a little exposed in the bomber formation. During the first wave of fighters that came against my plane the right cheek, top turret and right waist gunners badly damaged and turned away an attacking Me-410. However, an ME-109 piloted by a Luftwaffe "ace" pilot hit us on his third attack (I had three of my plane's guns trained on this fighter and we just couldn't hit him!).

During the third attack by this Me-109, coming it from 1:30 high position, my plane's electrical system was damaged, forcing the entire crew to bail out over the enemy occupied Paris area. Three crew members died during this bail out and the rest were captured. The only crew member to be found and assisted by friendly resistance fighters and returned to England was yours truly, the pilot. My entire crew is gone, my plane was shot down, and I am back in England about to get recycled back into the storm. New plane, new crew, enemy occupied Europe here I come.

RATING: 8
An exhaustively detail update the Avalon Hill classic, B-17 Queen of the Skies. If you loved B-17 then this is likely a must have for you. My first fly through took a lot longer than a typical B-17 mission would. Part of that was due to it being my first time, but mainly it stemmed from the game being so much more detailed with many more chats than B-17. I do miss having the charts on card stock sheets. I find flipping back and forth though the books a bit tedious and I can see the books getting worn out fairly quickly. I may have to make my own card stock sheets with frequently used charts.

Got to be in the right mood, it takes a bit of setting up. 

Found the rules a little fiddly to get through, but the game it itself is fun. I enjoy the 'random' story it takes you through.

That's what it is though, a story, you kinda do what your told and watch a random story unfold, not a lot of 'gamely' things to do.

Flipping backwards and forwards through 2 different books to play is a bit of a Pain to do too.

All the errata's, missing tables, and confusion makes the game hard to take off the shelf and play. (Main reasion the score is kept low)

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
There is a bit of a learning curve, but once you get the flow of each zone and combat, this game is very fun.  It draws me into the action.  Not recommended if you can't put yourself into the 'story'.  But if you can, it will really grab you and keep you coming back for more.  Very high on my want to play list!  Recommended.

I've enjoyed the game very much so far. I never played B-17 Queen of the Skies so this is a new experience for me. I agree with the many posts that there is not a ton of decision making aside from which gunners fire at which enemy aircraft (and a few other small decisions) but the narrative is excellent. I play so many war games that are very complex with a lot of decisions to make that sitting back and watching the action play out almost on its own is quite refreshing, in my opinion. Like many other squad level war games I became very attached to my bomber and crew.

I am NOT a fan of the rulebook. It mixes the rules with historical notes with charts with little examples....its just not great. Shortly after the game came out there had to be errata release with the most recent one being 15 pages long. That just doesn't make sense to me. Make sure you download the v1.1 rules from the publisher website. It makes it a bit easier. Truthfully, after playing through the first mission you get pretty used to the rules. It is a lot of rinse, wash, repeat.

Love the game! Every paycheck I go and buy 1-2 Wings of Glory miniatures that match the fighters in the game and replace the counters. ITS AWESOME!

Updated B-17 QOTS. Awesome!  Arrived June 2017 off LWG pre-order. First got to the table in January 2018.  First mission was a Milk Run -- not exciting, which I'm sure the crew loved, but the player did not.  Let's see what happens next...

RATING: 5
For what it is, this game is very good.  However, to call it a "game" is a stretch as this is really more of a tool to help the owner make a story.  There are not really any decisions to be made.  You roll the dice and write down what happens.  Thats pretty much the end of it.  If you are looking to make a narrative, then this will fit the bill perfectly.  If you are looking for some sort of strategic engagement, you will not find that here.  I was pretty unhappy to find that I had to make copies of pages and print a missing table before play as well.  I guess some folks spend a lot of money on single games but I typically keep my game purchases on the cheap.  For those that do spend a lot on a game, the requirement to make copies and print missing info may not be a big deal.  For me, I fully expected to take this out of the box and get started which I couldn't do.  I'm sure Steve and Shawn worked really hard on this game so I'm not trying to insult something that I'm sure was very special to the designers but for me, it really missed the mark. (Note: I had never played QoTS so that may have influenced my decision to purchase)

RATING: 7
Having to reprint all 5 instruction booklets sucked.  

It would have been nice to keep the design notes in their own section so you can follow the rules easier.  Also, the rules aren't all in order as you play, like it says they are.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's OK and improves on others in this narrative generation utility genre, but ultimately it's still just a bunch of rolls that when strung together create a 'story', but not much of a game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
If you get immersed in a game you'll enjoy the drama. If you consider yourself a spectator you'll gripe about rolling dice. Personally, I love imagining the narrative, so I enjoy this game. 
Two things that enhance the game: (1) using some (many) of the options and variants available on Board Game Geek, and (2) flying missions as part of a Play-by-Forum group, which deepens the immersion into a mission. I'd rate this a 7 instead of a 9 without those two factors.

Excellent solo game core rules, with lots of WWII historical background included.  This is a remake of B-17 Queen of the Skies - Think B-17QotS on steroids.  Introduces full squadron and group play which is solid but innovative players will want more.  Very solid game that plays well "as-is" but also allows customization to add flavor, color and depth.  Very well done!

Ive played it 6 times now.
It is basically B-17 QotS on steroids.
Much more detail than B-17, even though it plays very similar. A few more charts which means some more die rolling as TFT uses 2 6d and 2 10d. I would've rated it higher however there is quite a bit of back n forth between the various books and charts which can sometimes bog things down a bit, as well as the need to regularly print charts.

Outstanding game and simulation.  Despite all the charts, the game is easy to learn and intuitive to play.  So much rich detail.  A great solitaire gaming experience.  It would have been helpful to have the charts on sturdier card stock and have a one-page sequence of play.  But that's nitpicking.   This is a GREAT game!

Target for Today Bombers Over the Reich 1942 to 1945    Board Game Review.  Publisher: Legion War Games   Game Designer: Steve Dixon & Bob Best Price $80.00

Passed Inspection: High quality attractive and functional components, superb narrative experience, simulates five aircrafts – B24s and B17s – with amazing detail. Very easy to learn. Excellent tutorial.

Failed Basic:  Some Axis aircrafts such as the Me210 are a little too common; number of tables may intimidate some gamers, a few more role playing elements could be added to the bomber crew if the players want a more exacting level of immersion such as crew starting skills and home airfield.

2017 has been a great year for B17 Flying Fortress themed games.  Armchair General has already reviewed the excellent “B17 Flying Fortress Leader:” by DVG Games and Lock N’ Load Publishing has released their “A Wing and a Prayer”.  While both of those games focus on leading squadrons of bombers, a new take on an Avalon Hill classic puts the player fully in charge of one B17 or B24 and that plane’s crew.

“Target for Today” is the much anticipated update of the classic Avalon Hill game “B17, Queen of the Skies” which was designed by Glen Frank.  While utilizing a similar design system, “Target for Today” expands the game to include more aircrafts and a widened time period scope.  It also organizes the tables in a more convenient way.

“Target for Today” is a solitaire game which simulates the decisions made by the captain and crew of either a Flying Fortress model B17F, B17G, YB-40 or a B24 Liberator models D or J.  Each plane has an individual control board and special rules for components such as special turrets.  The YB-40 is especially interesting from a gaming perspective as this plane is the “gunship” or “escort” version of the B17 which housed upwards of 18 machine guns!  While the YB-40 was considered a failed design, it still makes for an interesting gaming experience.

The Roy Grinnell artwork on the box of both a B17G and a B24 is, quite simply, stunning.  Upon opening the box, the player will find tons of goodness!  Included in the box is an 11” x 17” battle board, 232 counters, 5 cards for the bombers you can pilot, a 44 page rule book, a 32 page book of charts, target books, aircraft flight manuals, 5 11” x 17” crew boards which show the stations and crew positions for each bomber plus 10 play aids.  An updated rule book and FAQs are available on-line.

While all the goodies packed in the box seem intimidating upon first glance, the game is actually very easy to learn and play.  The rules are designed to easily and logically walk you through the game.  Once you get the flow of the game turns, it’s really just die rolls and chart reading.  The game can be played as standalone missions, campaign playing or even multi-player flying!

First you pick the year you will be starting your campaign.  Then you pick the type of bomber you wish to fly.  After naming both your bomber and your crew members and assigning those boys to their appropriate positions on the plane, you are ready to fly!

Tables walk the player through all aspects of the mission from take off to either a safe landing back at your airfield or, perhaps, a more somber end to your crew.
Since the focus of “Target for Today” is the operations of one bomber, you follow orders and try to carry them out.  Target tables list your ‘target for today’ based upon the time period and whether you are flying in the 8th or 15th Air Force.  Full tables walk you through what units you are flying for.  For example, my B17F named “Why Worry?” is flying for the 8th Air Force, 1st Air Division, 2nd Bomb Wing, 389th Bomb Group, 567 Bomb Squadron.

A table of what base you are flying out of based upon your Bomb Squadron would have been nice.

The crews start out pretty much all the same but as they shoot down enemy planes and complete more missions gain additional skills.  I think an interesting optional add on would be to assign the starting crew members with beginner skills and then assign their positions based upon these skills – this would deepen the role playing element.

After creating your bomber and crew, the target is assigned.  The distance to the target is based upon zones.  For each zone to the target, the player rolls for weather and cloud cover.  The weather over your airfield and from previous zones can influence the weather for additional zones.  In addition, the weather can influence your planes meeting up with friendly fighters (the “little friends”), enemy fighters, whether you maintain your position in the bomber formation, etc.  My second mission in my campaign was scrubbed owing to bad weather over the target!

While traveling to and from the target, you may meet up with enemy fighters.  These fighters include the ubiquitous Bf 109 (or Me 109), Fw190, Me110, Me210, Me410 and, as the years progress, rocket and jet fighters such as the Me262 and the Me163!  Each enemy plane is rated for endurance which is a factor of fuel and ammo capacity as well as pilot quality.  I had one Me109 piloted by an Ace come at me three times trying to shred my aircraft!  The “Battle Board” which shows your bomber in the middle is marked off by possible enemy aircraft positions.  It becomes very nail biting when you have planes coming in from 12 O’clock high, 1:30 Low, 6 O’clock level and then have one diving on you from the vertical position.  As the planes attack, you have to assign your gunners to fire on them and determine the quantity of their fire power.  Spraying bullets may help hit a bogey but can also jam up the guns and use up your ammo faster!

Complete tables spin the narrative of how many aircrafts are intercepted by your fighter escorts if you have any (until the P51 became operational, you lose your little friends when you fly deeper in to German territory), what damage you do to the enemy planes and, if you shoot one down, does the pilot bail out, flak damage to your aircraft, crew wounds, fires, even frostbite is accounted for if your heaters go out.

This game has it all for those wanting to experience the nail biting terror that the heroes who flew in the 8th and 15th Air Forces went through.  An average mission can be played in as little as one hour but I had one mission last for three hours as everything seemed to go wrong.  I must have attracted gremlins!

Those who don’t like dice rolling created narratives may not appreciate this game but, if you want random events in a board game, you either roll dice or draw cards.  If you don’t like it, go play a computer game.

While the game is nearly perfect, I think a few more additional tables would be helpful.  A “Time Between Missions” table would be nice so that you can keep track of how many missions you fly in a month.  Also I found that the frequency of fighter attack was a little too great but then again who wants to fly a game based so on reality that it becomes boring?  Also, the frequency of encountering some rare planes such as the Me210 and the Me262 seems a little too great.

None-the-less, even with these few minor quibbles, “Target for Today” is a fantastic game which spins a rich narrative of World War 2 bomber missions.  Two sequels have been released – “B29 Superfortress” which covers bomber operations in the Pacific and “Hell Over Korea” which adds the Korean conflict to the B29 game.

I can’t wait to fly all of them!

B-17: QotS was on my radar for a while, I'm glad to get an updated version of this classic. 

I am immensely enjoying this game. I am only 1 mission in so far, but I can't imagine tiring of this gem. What many tables and a few dice can accomplish is amazing. Every mission and campaign will be different, and players have the same options available to them as the crew had, the outside events (weather, enemy resistance, etc) are controlled by the dice.

TFT is a fine simulation for those interested in WWII bombing runs. Despite a fairly lengthy rulebook, the game was easy to pick up and it plays well. Flipping page after page of tables doesn't slow things down the way I thought thanks to the books. The missions all play fairly quickly, although multiple 3-wave, multi-enemy attacks can drag the game a bit.

Edit: Upping this to 10 (from 9). Wow. I've had 1 cancelled mission, 1 milk run, and 1 fairly brutal mission. Each one has been an absolute blast.

Fun game. Like watching a WWII movie. One can even recreate the storyline, in a way, that follows the movie, "12 O'Clock High". The game is more of a simulation than a game as the player does not have many choices. Neither did the crews on the bombers. They had to takes things as they came, as best they could, to complete the mission successfully. Lots of dice/die rolls and chart/table referencing. Thus the narrative movie like feel. I like that aspect of it. Which way will the story go next! Can't wait!

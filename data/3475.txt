RATING: 4
Fun setting. Sadly, all the standard conventions of CCGs are hung about that setting like a thousand millstones. If Kung-Fu movies were as oppressively intricate, they would have never become popular enough to inspire this game.

Best with 4 players. Except for 2-player, generally requires a level of diplomacy / Jedi Mind Trickery to win. My CCG of choice, although I have not played in years. (Except at BGG.Con 2011 where I beat Zev!)

RATING: 8
Doesn't feel very strong as a two player game, but I like the mechanics, I like the feel, and I like the game... but really need to play it 3+ player.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
If you must play 2-player Shadowfist then it's best not to base your impressions on it.  Really this should be played with 3+ players.  2-player feels like going through the motions but multi-player is amazing.

Update:  Too hard to find players.  I would normally rate this an 8 if I could actually get to play it.

Update: I think I'm over CCGs.  No chance to play this live.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Not the most elegant CCG, Shadowfist earns its ranking by sheer fun. A great theme, nicely managed (rares are mainly cards you want one or two each, commons are powerful). I play many different games, but I played around 150 hours of 'Fist each year for over 6 years.

Recent play has fallen off recently, with the growth of the San Antonio Board Gamers. So many new games.

Thought I'd enjoy this one more than I did. I don't think I like muliplayer CCGs much in general. This one took too long (of course it depends on the decks you play), and I just had the feeling I'd rather be playing 2 player Magic or MECCG ...

RATING: 8
The rules for multiplayer games make this one of the best CCGs out there. I really like the way you have limited amounts of power to play your cards so you do agonise each turn about what is best to play. I dislike the fact the power production, victory conditions and the rate of a player cycles through their deck are all interlinked so that the leaders get richer while the poor stay hopelessly poor. Means that games tend to move very slowly.

So, the only way I can attack is if I have so much more power than someone else to take their land out in 1 turn.  And can do that without leaaving myself completely open.  How often is that likely to happen?  Do we really need a 3 hour CCG?

Excellent multi-player CCG, plenty of opportunities to get back into the game if you start losing. 3-4 players take 30-90 minutes for a game.  Turn-based mechanics with less than 10 bold-faced abilities (terms you have to learn to understand the cards).  Simple mechanics and lots of card drawing (built into the game, rather than a faction-specific ability) make for quick learning and comprehension, and a large card pool where commons are the lynchpin to any deck make for variety and ease of entry.

One of the best CCGs, in my opinion, and easily my favorite multi player CCG.  I have all of the original cards released by Daedalus and some of the ones released by Z-Man.  Despite getting out of CCGs for the most part, I'm hanging onto my Shadowfist cards.  Perhaps I'll run across some people who will be interested in learning this fine game.  I certainly have enough cards to supply them with everything they need to start playing!

RATING: 8
Has the inherent problems of CCGs (deck-building, many rules, tons of different card abilities, strange desire to acquire thousands of cards, etc.). But if you can get past that, then this game is a must-have for gamers who also enjoy Hong Kong action & goofy horror cinema. IMO, game play is a 6 but the theme is an 11.

TCG generally don't play well with more than 2 players but this one was designed from ground up for multiplayer and it's great for 3 to 4 players. Rating is for the multiplayer games, 2 players isn't recommended for this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
One of the best multi-player CCGs ever made. I recommend playing with 3-4 players as the sweet-spot, although there is a dedicated dueling community out there. The game bogs down a lot with five, or more, players.

It's worth noting that that the later expansions for the game by Inner Kingdom Games (rather than Z-man Games, or Shadowfist Games) transitioned to a fixed-pack LCG model, rather than a collectable one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
game seemed to fiddly to me then again CCGs can easily have this happen to them.  after the first two rounds it felt like you knew who was going to win and there was nothing you could do to stop it.

Partially I dig the theme (Hong Kong action movies - ALL of 'em, no matter if they're "historical", fantasy, sci-fi, or modern).

But the game itself works fairly well - note I've never done deck building, just played with "pre-cons" that a friend has built and/or collected. Deck building is the part of CCGs I enjoy the least, so not having to deal with that, but being able to play the game, has pulled me in.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I came back to play this recently.  My memory was of a fun and dynamic game and that is there, if you get to it.  But what happens way way too often is that one player gets a bit stuck without one of the foundation resources, is a bit slow off the mark and as a result, gets pummeled by the other player.  This is a possibility in any game where you need to draw something out of a randomized deck of cards to get started, but is worse in Shadowfist because you need (usually) TWO things (sites/a source of power and foundation characters) and a lack of either one can be fatal.  We've tried some house rules to overcome it, with a set character and site in play at the beginning, but how do you pick which feng shui site?  So nostalgia has for the moment given way to reality and I'll probably play some other card game to scratch my old CCG itch.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
2-7p, 10m.  The multi-player aspect sounds like it might make it more sociable for a lunchtime game than many of the other "duelling" CCG's.  I've bought a starter deck (original edition) and a few boosters.  The artwork and design of the cards is pretty dated, but the mechanics of the game seem solid.  Dishonorable mention for bad art goes especially to Bryon Wackwitz who was apparently a teenage mutant in 1995 when a few of his pieces sullied the first ShadowFist set.  Later sets seemed to raise the bar.

Received a box of boosters in trade for some Star Wars minis mid 2007.

Classic collectible card game which focuses on multiplayer play. The lack of player elimination makes games much more fun compared to multiplayer MTG. A great job of world-building leads to some very interesting factions with very different flavor and play styles. Occasionally can cause analysis paralysis in a way that MTG does not, but I consider this a good thing.

Best multiplayer CCG ever, still under development after 11 years, with many sets and all cards still legal (some with eratta).  Decent in 2-player, great in multiplayer.  Downsides: low player base, unbounded game length (averages to about ((# players-1) ^ 2 * 10 minutes, but can be much longer or shorter than that).

Fun CCG with an engaging theme.  I haven't played multi-player yet but could see that it would be a strong point.  You can get the beat down fairly quickly but it just means you get to play again.  I love that they sold seperate decks for this since I don't have time for deck-building shenanigans.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
For my money (quite a bit of it, to date) this is the finest CCG ever.  Zero power-creep over the years, great flavor to the cards, and a base game that favors 3 or 4 players, rather than 2.  Perfection!

RATING: 1
This game being collectible means the gameplay is fundamentally broken.  The process of figuring out what combinations are better is a puzzle not a game.  Sitting by yourself constructing a deck is the definition of solitary play (a puzzle).

Beyond that the business model of collectible games is deplorable.  It is a form of gambling targeted towards children.  It adds no benefit to the gameplay is done specifically to milk as much money from people as possible.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
The ultimate CCG for 3-4 players.  I played this a ton back in the day, but it never hits the table anymore.  Like most collectible games, you really need a devoted group of friends to play this with, although not necessarily with their own collections.  I had a ton of fun playing this weekly with my college friends who mostly used my decks, which highlight how much fun the game actually is (so many other CCG's are only interesting in building the decks, the gameplay is meh).  Having a group with their own collections and making their own decks is even better, but this game is basically dead.

By far the best multiplayer CCG/LCG that I've played.  It fixed so many of the problems I saw with Magic:
1. Faster card flow - start of turn may discard 1 and draw back up to 6
2. Saving of mana/power - unused power is banked for future turns, so you can still play a big character eventually if you sit and save up, rather than having to draw more land/sites
3. Better method for allowing multi-faction decks - not based on color-specific land, but playing of color/faction-specific characters that provide resources to play more cards in that color/faction (which are not spent but just checked to see if you have enough provided from card in play and dead pile)
4. No player elimination - you can always come back and win, you're rarely completely out of it, since even if you play something you can't defend, other players will help defend you to stop someone from winning, and may allow you to build back up enough to strike for the win.
5. More interesting theme - based on a real fleshed-out RPG world, rather than make-it-up-as-you-go generic fantasy.
6. No summoning sickness - after playing Shadowfist, going back to Magic with summoning sickness feels soooo slooooowww. 
7. And most importantly - designed for multiplayer. 
I can't really recommend a new player to get into this game purchasing cards, since the player community is so small, but I am always happy to teach new players and provide them with decks and access to my moderate collection to design their own.

This is the second best multiplayer CCG, after Vampire: the Eternal Struggle. The awesome theme and artwork makes every game like a visit to another world, although the kung fu theme has become slightly diluted with the Z-Man expansions. Still, Z-Man deserves recognition for bringing this great game back to life, and adding some new victory conditions. Usually, it is annoying and expensive to acquire enough cards to play competitively in a CCG, but the Z-Man starter decks are excellent, allowing anybody with approximately $10 or $12 to play a great deck.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A tongue-in-cheek CCG based on kung fu movies which captres some of the eclectic things that seem to happen in them.  Evil scientists from the future, sinister underworld machinations, demons and of curse butt-kicking monks.  The game is very fast paced and a good run of cards from all players' decks makes for a wild and exciting game.  It does have a drawback - if you don't get certain kinds of cards, you are a dead duck.  Worse, you need a source of power (usualy what they call Feng Shui sites) AND you need basic foundation characters before you can play the better more expensive ones, so it can get stuck two ways.  Still, when it clicks it is a blast!

Full review pending.
Culled - First wave.
Note: Gifting TBD; it is hanging out in a "to be distributed" pile.

I am also grappling with the idea of keeping my monkey deck. This would largely be for posterity, as finding a player would be nigh impossible (barring the unlikely perfect gift recipient). If I go that route, I may also build one more deck, so that I have a little "2-player kit". If I do that, I'll move this back into "owned games".

A good multiplayer card game.

Interesting theme & decent mechanics. I don't really know the game well enough to teach it- which leads to a lack of opponents. Not helpful.

Arguably, the best beer and pretzels multi-player CCG ever.  The theme was wonderfully transcribed into card form.  Cyborg monkeys, hopping vampires, tai-chi old-men, and orbital laser batteries - oh my!

While dueling was possible, a slow start was hard to overcome.  Multiplayer is where the game shined, as long as you like the cascading attempts to win.

The end game began when one player tried to win.  All would gang up to stop him.  The strategy then became stop with using as few resources as possible.  This would continue around the table until there was a winner.

All in all, great fun.

Best multi-player CCG around.  I've played it regularly for years (and playtested most of the Z-Man expansions).  Our London group never plays the dueling (2 player) game though some people seem to like it.

The concepts of CCGs just bothers me after spending so much money on them. Shadowfist still seems to be one of the better multiplayer card games. Its not too bad for duels too.  Fortunately I had a wonderful person construct my decks (the other thing I don't like about CCGs).

The most enjoyable four-player game I know.  I've played hundreds of times and will play hundreds more.  A great mix of chaos, strategy, tactics, and diplomacy.  Also:  frequently hilarious.  See my Game Cabinet review for detailed information; since I've written that review, the game has come back from the dead with a vengeance.

1 box of starters (1st set), cards opened but still in boxes.

Странно, но в России никогда не играли в эту очень динамичную ККИ. 
А ведь игра каким-то чудесным образом держится на плаву давно-давно. Может быть секрет в том, что будучи коллекционной, сетов за все годы вышло немного.?

Mostly cards from the first set and the Flashpoint expansion.  Approx 1000 cards.

Now where did I put these. Neat little game. The thing about CCGs is you always feel like you bought the game but you're missing some pieces.

High-strategy deckbuilding game with highly interactive, fast-paced play.  Based on cheesy Hong Kong action flicks!  What's not to love?!

Only played with the base set so far but this game is a lot of fun. This ranks after Netrunner, Vtes, On the Edge, but above the other 30+ CCGs I've played so far. I want to play more of this one.

Shadowfist was actually a pretty nifty CCG, and it did introduce me to Feng Shui the RPG. If you like the latter, the CCG is well worth giving a go.

The most insanely cool multiplayer CCG of the '1st Generation.'  Shadowfist is a game I got lost in for years with a local playgroup.  It requires great players to bring the best out of it, however.
